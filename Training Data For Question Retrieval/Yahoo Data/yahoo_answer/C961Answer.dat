3nN1vTTuaa	i believe everything is perfect. 9.5/10 i would slightly change match  2 to have Beth Phoenix. The rest of the matches i would not change at all. Good work on this card!!|`|JiCfYfLraa	i kinda like it lol|`|9Us6XYg8aa	great card   8/10|`|Pne371ESaa	I like it except i wouldnt put both Hardy's in it because i want that feud to gain more heat before they go at it.     Hopefully we get at LEAST matches 1 and 3|`|FsnxfhEuaa	I love The Matches, But Putting The Hardys' In the Same Match, Would Kinda Ruin It a little, because if you see one go after another, it will spoil the match when they go at it, So you'd know who would win, and it would be a Predictable Match lol :P....        Otherwise then that, I really Liked Them, I Would Love To see a Handicap Match with Randy Orton vs. Shane Mcmahon vs. Mr. Mcmahon.         Hopefully, Match Number 3 will happen :p      Great, I like them 8.95/10

5f4qvGLKaa	Wolfslair not even a contest    Michael Bisping and Paul kelly wer ebrought up there    Now Rampage and Cheick Kongo started training there|`|ieUgty5Faa	It's gotta be Wolfslair.    Michael Bisping, the best fighter out of the UK, and Rampage Jackson.|`|ru0P36MHaa	Wolfslair.  Without question.  Ask yourself who are the best fighters in the UK, and what camp do they come from?
JiCfYfLraa	i do i love chris jerico i always loved him. he was the first ever undisputed champion. i hated how he lost his championship to john cena that was a fluke victory. chris jericho is a legend in the business and he is the true wrestling god. i dont like how the wwe treats jericho in a way i miss the funny jericho thats always calling somebody junior lol,the jericho that talks a lot of smack and back it up in the ring. this jericho today i like also but something seems off and it doesnt compare to the past jericho. but yea i love jericho he is the best and is the true champion. i want jericho to become the undisputed champion again because he deserves it.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	i want a codebreaker just so i can make sure its fake...|`|9Us6XYg8aa	I do.  Him as Y2J is so much better.  He was funny with his promos.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	I'm guessing Victoria P is like 6 years old.. lol but yea I definitely want that Jericho back. he was a lot funnier and I loved how he would make his entrance.. showing his muscles and everything it was cool.. and his highlight real etc.. man I miss him.. he gotta go back to his old attire also..|`|3nN1vTTuaa	victoria is garbage she watches the show like they think idiots will|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Although I like Chris Jericho as a heel.He was only turned heel because Randy Orton was injured.Now because he made such a drastic turn it is hard to get him back to being the Y2J character once again.But with Raw's current state they really need a funny Y2J character like Chris Jericho as a face.They really do need a funny character honesty all I seem to laugh at is Santino's stupidity.They need someone to make everyone laugh,by pointing out Santino's relatedness.They need a funny Chris Jericho.Chris is a good heel,but Randy Orton and JBL are much better at the lead role of the heel on the show.They need Y2J back.It will take some time though because of his drastic turn to heel and becoming the second lead heel on the show.I do however sadly wait for Chris Jericho when talking to Stephanie McMahon to make a crack about her boobs or her marriage or something.    And um Victoria P,relax.He plays a character on television.He isn't really a jerk in real life.He's actually been called one of the nicest guys outside the ring.He isn't really evil.He's just playing a role on television chill.|`|Voa3zqGFaa	Not me|`|mJvZhdAuaa	I DO!  He was sooooo much better, but, I have to say, this newer, madder Jericho, is still as good athletically speaking.|`|XulcYwOnaa	i actually really like his gimmick right now. i mean, i loved the old Chris Jericho but i really like this new one. it shows that he's grown up.|`|yGpvN7Noaa	i want the old jercio back|`|U6tE9LhJaa	jericho is entertaining whatever gimmick he has|`|3074it1Qaa	the old Y2J was good but instead of going back to the past try something new  i mean jericho could have a Krusty the clown gimmick and still own. i like both gimmicks and i think jericho will go face before the year is over but it wouldn't hurt to try something new|`|QQyWUDI8aa	ME ME ME     I do Him as Y2J is so much better and alot of funny times lol|`|ZoIU9WtOaa	BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... JERICHO SUCKS. definitely not me|`|kY6H6Fvaaa	Me|`|qCt3yUNlaa	WWE has to stop with his whole "code" gimmick (save us/me). They need to give him a new look/theme to fit his current character. But either way I think Jericho might turn face again soon, but in the mean time, change his wrestling attire, his titantron/entrance video and maybe a new nickname for his heel gimmick (since he isn't being called Y2J anymore). And I think he should bring back the Highlight Reel as there are no segments/shows currently on RAW.|`|OK2MaIVHaa	ok hears my answer..  NO!!!!!!!!!!  1. he is horable  2. he thinks hes so good but hes not  3. he called everyone hipacrits (incloding u)  4. he is so mean  5. if u like him thers somthing rong with you, i think ur brain is on wrong!  NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO Y2J!!!!!!|`|ir2HKmjEaa	I have been following him since WCW/ECW and i really liked the joking y2j better|`|caczNImxaa	so much better than heel y2j. i want the face.|`|3u1FaRe0aa	me,i want you back.best of luck for elemination chamber.

Good luck!    Chris
JiCfYfLraa	yea i guess but he wasnt that popular.|`|4V6V9uN8aa	With the IC champion being Regal or CM Punk, no, All Snow would have maybe challenged them, but not beaten them..  I liked Al Snow & Head in ECW, they were wild & entertaining.  In WWE, the gimmick didn't work & Al really just became a jobber.  Even after the Tough Man competitions, even while "tutoring" Maven, Al was just there.  William Regal is a sound technical wrestler & an experienced champion.  Punk is coming into his own & could be sharper,  but he has heart & determination, not to mention one of the most devestating finishers in the business with the GTS.  Sorry, but Snow couldn't beat either one of them..|`|pT0SjzZGaa	Sad to say but no Al Snow pretty much was used as comedy after his run on ECW, remember when he fought himself in a Hardcore match?  Remember Head Cheese? anyways the prime of his career was pretty much getting multiple reigns with The Hardcore Championship so i think he'd get The treatment D-Lo Brown got when he returned which would mean he'd show up like once every 3 months to job a squash match to mike knox or someone|`|sqfjfR3iaa	The WWE Booking Team would have given him a new character, but yes, he certainly had the wrestling skill to be an Intercontinental Champion. WWE really saddled him with some lame gimmicks (Job Squad) and never really pushed him.
p8CpEmiVaa	They are suppose to interview Cardinals OC Todd Haley by the end of this week, and name him by next week...however they do have to interview a minority coach to satisfy the Rooney Rule.      Thanks,    Chris|`|zU31FL9aaa	never because he is immortal   dont you know it?|`|XLXncQu9aa	Well, I would think they are going to hold a press conference in a couple of weeks.  Now that the super bowl is over, I have heard that the leading candidate for KC is Todd Halely.  Of course Halely is the offensive coordinator for the Cardinals.  There was some rumor going around that it would be Mike Shannahan, but that wasn't true.  The Chiefs never contacted Mike about the job, so as it stands Halely is the leading candidate.  Its been said so on NFL network.
ru0P36MHaa	GSP did not cheat.  His corner is a another story....    The better question is, did he win because of it?  I think the answer is a definite no.  Bigger, stronger, faster, better.  When they tangled, standing or on the ground, he outclassed him.  Period.|`|Vrd8gB61aa	Well maybe but a lot of the corners massage them and such and put vasiline on their face. Even so he was sweating and it would have been slippery anyway.    I think it is an excuse for BJ to use.    Because either way GSP was more conditioned just look at them.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	You can't prove intent and I don't believe their was any malice involved in the move.    Needs to be a reprimand for the cornerman though.    Here's the NSAC's explanation:    http://mmajunkie.com/news/13895/kizer-pe...|`|MAlPvWhEaa	It's not out of the question. However, claiming that the Vaseline was the reason for Penn being dominated is just absurd.|`|u93eagkqaa	Yes he did cheat and and investigation is under way.     Penn would still have lost but why did GSP corner feel the need to cheat? GSP has been accused by two other fighters for being extra slippery.    Forget the Vaseline how does he pass the steroid test he is not natural and you all know it.|`|c85edd6c20baf6b5617d90f1c0b02a6aaa	i know gsp slipped 2 attempts by bj for the rubber guard ans possible submission but for some reason penn could not get the grip doesn't at all sound like the vaseline had anny affect yeah penn probably would have lost but we will really never know because all the other variables a cheat is a cheat and i think i would know if someone was rubbing me down with grease suspend them all    i am sure that if you caught me cheating i would come up with an explanation as well i am sure that they aren't gonna say oh you caught us dang it. no you have p.r people that spin this kind of stuff. that my friend Joe is a spin. i don't care who wins no favorite in this fight i do know that greasing goes on you are naive to believe it doesn't just like roids but if all police just listened to the explanation of criminals i am sure we would have no one on death row . oh its right there Jeffery dahmer said he didn't do it he must be innocent. wake up. the object here is to remain impartial  3 hours ago - Edit - Delete   Source(s):  look what happened to Margarito for his hand wraps (boxing) they discovered 3 time and made him re wrap his hands because of plaster of paris in the wraps he not his trainers or the guy that wrapped his hands was handed an indefinite suspension so it could be conceived that gsp could be held liable for his trainers action this is not the only time gsp or Jackson's camp have been accused of greasing and if you think it had no bearing on the fight smear some Vaseline on your buddies head back and front torso then see if you can even apply a rubber guards or a triangle and steroids aren't not an unfair Advantage yeah right i coach boxing grease elbows padding gloves even tearing the inner stuffing of glove are all old tricks and yes people do it in all aspects of sport we have had amateur boxers at events i have been to get dq'd for using Vaseline  oh yeah they discovered the wraps before the fight and still let it continue i wonderrt how many opponents he has done that to what a shame|`|5bzJUmh4aa	I read (I think on Sherdog) that the officials saw the vaseline and wiped off his back with a towel before the round began, and warned his corner about it.  If this is true, then it seems his corner tried to cheat, but that it was prevented and it had no impact on the outcome of the fight.  At least I hope that is the case.  It would be a shame if his victory was tainted.    I just read several more articles and watched some video and it seems like Penn has a legitimate complaint.  The officials noticed between the 2nd and 3rd round.  If they did this between the first and second also, it definitely would have made it harder for BJ to defend himself from the ground in round 2.  That is the round where GSP started to take control.  They should rule it a no contest and fine GSP.|`|LXoP4HWNaa	well, i guess the vaseline would help but vaseline doesnt help GSP beating the **** out of BJ to the point where Penn can barely stand|`|MnECjJ00aa	well he did, and im sure it effected the fight,but regardless i still say gsp would have won, it seemed like bj penn talked sh*t more than he did train,he obviously didnt train as hard as gsp, he took a week vacation from training and he came in looking all flabby cause he needed to gain like 20 pounds.|`|fhUTR34aaa	The vaseline on St. Pierre makes him very slipery, it shows when Penn can't hold on to him and defend from the mat which he should be able to with his Jujitsu skills. It's clear cut cheating, Penn could still have lost the fight but couldn't have been dominated that way.|`|hyMK1wtMaa	yall should watch the fight over again!! In the first round GSP couldnt get BJ to the ground then he did land a few good punches BUT he was also warned for Trying to use BJ's shorts to take him down! thats a NO NO and Bj lands 75% of his punches then if you watch the corners going into the second round his cornermen RUB VASALINE on his neck and shoulders, and right behind his neck! round 2 Bj has the triangle BUT IT SLIPS AND SLIPS AND SLIPS.....hmmm why?? then Yes Bj is dominated but he cant get a hold of GSP....surprising! then going in to the 3rd round his corner goes straight from his face and rubs his back all down his back. They wipe it down but.....have you ever tried to wipe vasaline? It doesnt take it off completely! then GSP slides into side control tooooo easily! and hands BJ the *** whooping of his life. Yes BJ loss but was it FAIR???? No I honestly think that his corner wanted to ensure the WIN no matter what! Hey if they hadnt put vasaline on his shoulders going into the 2nd round then maybe the triangle wouldnt have slipped so many times!! But because of his corner GSP didnt fight a fair fight he fought a good fight BUT NOT FAIR!|`|5i785w12aa	Yes|`|925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	I think GSP would have won anyway, but GSPs corner did break the rules.|`|FQRBOZipaa	wouldn't surprise me at all,it would be slippery with all the sweat anyway,gsp was so much bigger and stronger i don't think that would have made a difference,i regular lw against a fully juiced big welter with awesome wrestling,bj was never going to submit gsp,that would be a bad game-plan against another bb that has olympic level wrestling.but yes i can believe his CORNER would do that.|`|b0faTDlJaa	I dont know about that but what i did see is BJ turning his head so GSP would hit him in the back of the head.|`|V2nAiEHkaa	yeah the cornerman got caught and officials wiped off st. pierre's back in the following rounds. dana stated that the cornerman could possibly lose his license. i don't think it really affected the outcome of the fight though.  GSP is definitely the dominate fighter.
qUQnsqnsaa	I'd say Matt Hardy is a jealous mess! WE WANT JEFF, so what! Matt has gotta learn that fans just don't come out the f*cking window fans are EARNED and you don't get fans by costing the WWE Champion his title especially if the Champion is your' brother!         So, to Matt Hardy I say: "YOU SCREWED JEFF, YOU....SCREWED....JEFF"!|`|0DW8nj5caa	It is only a storyline...|`|JiCfYfLraa	he is not jealous he just wants his fair share of things he is so tired of being overlooked and personally i agree with matt hardy he is a better wrestler then jeff anyway.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	Well is jealous like we are jealous of our brother if he gets something we don't get. matt likes to share with his bro but matt feel  awfull when matt won the wwe is title and when matt lost his own title..     everything is part of the storyline ..matt doesnt hate jeff in reall life but it just so wwe is scripted    ..    thx 4 the 2 points =D|`|3nN1vTTuaa	i agree with him being jealous|`|4V6V9uN8aa	According to WWE (supposed to be) Creative, yes..  What is happening is a back-up storyline due to Christian's legal entanglements with TNA.  I mean, think about it.  Matt faces Edge the Friday show before the Rumble.  Matt is beating Edge, only to be triple-teamed by the man he beat for the ECW title-Mark Henry & the man he has to face for the ECW title-Jack Swagger.  They help Matt get his a** handed to him by Edge.  Then, two days later, Matt gift-wraps the WWE title for Edge by turning on his brother...  If this was ACTUAL JEALOUSY, would it not have made more sense to help Jeff RETAIN the title, then sneak attack him during the celebration?  Thus, you would not only have revenge on the a** who stole Lita from you, but put yourself in line for a WWE title shot or at least in the Elimination Chamber match.      C'mon people, wake up & smell what the WWE is shoveling..!!!|`|855bpb3Caa	Yes he's jealous of Jeff in the storyline, but that's all it is, a storyline.|`|aULZ8D10aa	Matt rules, jeff sucks.|`|OK2MaIVHaa	matt is so mean and YES HE IS JELOUS! i cant belive he did that, then i watch wwe raw last week and heard him say that with all that vids, i was cryin! i use to like matt, but now i hate him! HOW COULD HE!!!!|`|yGpvN7Noaa	yes  hes jealous he is the older brother and jeff got more titles then him and even beat him in a hardcore match for the Hardcore champ|`|st1hdYKVaa	here's my answer but im not 100% sure i think a GM told him to and get a title match with swagger and jeff gets 1 too but jeff dont know it yet    hope i helped|`|1qkSumbDaa	Matt is way too jealous. He needs to cool it down. Jeff is good a wrestler and he deserves the WWE Championship.|`|zTuHo7abaa	He is jealous because, the whole time he was ecw champion he thought not one respected him and no one really payed attention to him, but when jeff got tht title opportunity everybody started 2 pay attention 2 Jeff and not Matt anymore. So he got mad and started 2 do all tht stuff to him an try 2 cost him title opportunities and when jeff who he attacked him so he cudnt b champion anymore.|`|caczNImxaa	i think its a good storyline but like i said its a storyline. but i still love BOTH hardy boyz!|`|HiykTVtJaa	I know that this storyline is something that they have wanted to do for a while.  It kinda sucks because you love to see them together and standing up for each other but they played it well.

6e083f2ba7e3043fb68160d6bfe280dcaa	Don't pay any attention to the fake stuck up girls.   You do what you want. Play or not, be your own person.  If you do decide to try out - give it all you got. Show them that you are as good or better than they are.  As for the "hot shy" guy: Put your priorities first. Is it the team or the guy you want?
1X8c2hEFaa	well im a laker fan, but i gotta admit than Stephen A. Smith is right.  without bynum its going to be hard to win the championship. They are going to get push around by magic, celtics and cavaliers becuase lakers has a soft frontcourt. Gasol is good but he is so soft, he is so afraid to go inside he just keep faking and then just shoot jumpshot, hes making me mad when he keeps doing that. The only way i think they can win the championship without bynum is homecourt advantage.|`|9cub6mMQaa	Stephen A. Smith .... who the heck is he? Who did he get on his knees in front of to get the job he has? Who believes what that blow-hard has to say? He's got as much credibility as Stephen Glass (Look up Stephen Glass at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323944/ )|`|dDhTMacAaa	1. He's wrong    2.

Smith will do any crazy stunt to try to get some attention since he has no skills as an entertainer himself. The dude can't even talk right. I listen to him to know what to not root for. He sure is one of the reason the sports media is been traeted like a joke everywhere. He puts drama where it does not belong. Next question!!!
XLXncQu9aa	Yes.  The Eagles are more of an exciting team than the Cardinals are.  I actually predicted that to be the super bowl, but the Eagles defense collapsed at the end of the NFC championship game.  The Eagles have more exciting players, and their defense is better than that of the Cardinals. It would have been a PA super bowl which would have been better.|`|Um7mYM71aa	No.  Steelers sucks.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Why would they ,the cards almost won it.    It was a great game and the eagles had their chance and choked.|`|MaizmvvMaa	Would have been a lower scoring, more defensive game. Would have been better for me since i'm an eagles fan, other people i dunno.|`|AA10789965	better?? you couldn,t have had a better game...|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	i think i would have been the same|`|qsK7YNhDaa	I do i think the steelers would haveone though eagles suck!|`|WTQtchbvaa	No|`|p8CpEmiVaa	Yes, for the state on Pennsylvania....No, because McNabb probably would've cracked under pressure, and they would shut westbrook down like they did earlier on in the season. Plus, Philly doesn't have to offensive fire power that Arizona does.    thanks,    Chris|`|FmZyN6ORaa	no...the steelers would've dominated|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	You cant just say the Steelers would win this game because during the regular season the Eagles beat them Steelers in a defensive battle.|`|UztfjBOFaa	Yes it would be a very close game that would go to Overtime.
L77OlY1naa	Step1  Study the mechanics of a good swing. According to Hall of Famer Tony Gwyn, "bat speed comes from being in the correct position and using the correct swing." Video tape yourself during batting practice and have someone who knows hitting study it with you.  Step2  Practice hitting with a fungo bat. The fungo is smaller and lighter than a regular bat and will teach you how to generate good bat speed. Hit whiffle balls, tennis balls, or socks to avoid breaking the fungo bat.    Finding ways to improve bat speed will lead many people to some very strange methods. While there really is no secret that will magically improve bat speed, there are some unique and little known training tools that the pros have used for years to help them increase bat speed as much as ten miles per hour.    Likely, you have seen the basic wrist training techniques and other methods to help you bring the bat through the zone with more efficiency and more power. However, what you may not know is that too much muscle build up can actually slow down your swing. Some of the best techniques that professional players have used do not involve fancy training tools or heavier bats. In fact, ask most professional players and they will tell you using a donut or weighted bat will actually result in a slower swing.    One of the most effective ways to improve bat speed is to understand the proper way to grip the bat. The traditional fist on top of fist grip, as well as chocking up on a bat will result in slower bat speed. Grip the bat with your bottom hand below the knob of the bat, and allow that wrist to flick the bat through the swing zone. This action will improve your bat speed quickly. However, be sure to practice this swing, as learning how to do this and control that bat take some repetition.    There are many other simple technical changes you can make to your swing and your stance that will improve bat speed. Start thinking about feet placement, and how that relates to your hips opening up in your swing. The proper foot placement can allow your hips to open up quicker, which leads to a quicker bat.    There are some excellent ways to improve bat speed and increase your power. See the latest techniques and drills recommended by several professional scouts at http://www.batspeedtraining.info.      Step3  Swing a coat hanger. Straighten a coat hanger out and practice swinging with it every day. The lightness of the hanger will help you create a whip-like swing and increase the quickness of your hands.  Step4  Swing as many times as you can in 60 seconds. Have someone watch you during this drill to ensure that you maintain correct form.  Step5  Use a heavier bat during the off-season. Try hitting at the batting cages with a slightly heavier (a few ounces) bat. This will increase your strength and bat speed. Continue using your regular bat and video tape yourself periodically to avoid bad habits.  Step6  Hit soft toss with a weighted bat. Try hitting several balls with a weighted donut on your bat. Follow up by hitting balls without the weight.  Step7  Take extra batting practice. The more you practice hitting, the more consistent your swing will become. If you practice hitting with correct form, you cannot help but increase your bat speed.|`|Mxzz2my7aa	lift|`|FPjIOlSAaa	swing in a pool|`|gMTatFZBaa	YOu can read my answer on any one of the other 4291 times this has been asked over the last few weeks.

9cub6mMQaa	Why should they? I haven't and I've been a Lakers fan since Jerry West was screwed out of the MVP in '65-'66. Kobe doesn't have common sense. Common sense SHOULD have told him that he NEVER should have put himself into such a tenuous position. It's ego that did it - and that part of him hasn't changed (and most likely never will).    They have left great players in other sports out of the Hall of Fame for less than what Kobe was accused of. Joe Jackson in baseball (never did anything wrong but was on the team that threw the World Series). Pete Rose in baseball (never did gamble on games until he was a manager - didn't affect his playing days at all). Alex Karras in football (many all-pro seasons but missed one season due to gambling, exactly like Paul Hornung who IS in the HOF). The list goes on and on.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Nobody forgives someone for something that never happened.|`|Or43gwRjaa	Gasol should advertise for them.|`|bABkMrADaa	dude your really obsessed of big macs and Mc Donald's|`|LlMS9NsSaa	No!

Xkm4PstOaa	He hasn't officially signed a contract with the WWE.  I do know that he ISN'T going to resign with TNA though...    Everything, right now, is just a rumor!  Nothing more...|`|h9PVRHPWaa	My magic 8 ball says all signs point to yes.|`|7rpILeYtaa	at Wresltemania,  or the weeks leading up to Wrestlemania.      It is confirmed that he is coming back:  exert from TNA president Dixie Carter's interview with "The Daily Star"       She is quoted to have said to the paper Im very disappointed. I like him as a person as well as a talent. Its interesting, he was the first big name to jump ship to us and hes been the first to jump back. I wish him all the best.   |`|JiCfYfLraa	its just a rumor that doesnt make it true i dont know why people keep saying that. just because his contract expired in tna doesnt mean he is coming to the wwe.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	They are rumours flying all around. Nothing has been confirmed. TNA and WWE both want him to sign but he is hasn't decided yet. The WWE has been offering more money because they have more then TNA but TNA doesn't want to lose him. But so far he hasn't signed with anyone. TNA is however had meeting with him trying to get him to stay they have even has wrestlers talk to him one on one trying to get him to stay on TNA. But Edge his real life best friend has been trying to talk him into the WWE again. Christian has said that he has not taken any offers yet and he says he will be doing what is best financially for is family. Which personally I think that being said would be WWE because of the money but I don't know.But nothing has been set in stone for a WWE return or a TNA return.|`|4V6V9uN8aa	As of two days prior to the Rumble, it was reported on Pro Wrestling News that Christian would not be at the Rumble due to a contract stipulation with TNA.  Christian is not a free agent as of yet.  He is no longer with TNA, yet he is not with WWE yet.  His contract wth TNA has expired & he is off of their website.  But, in a counter to the contract offered by WWE, TNA has offered Christian a larger contract that his legal advisors are considering.  Thus, at the Rumble, RVD was entered on a stand-by basis & matt Hardy was entered into the Edge/Jeff Hardy-"Mystery Attacker" storyline.  At this time, it is unknown when or if Christian will re-sign with TNA or with WWE in time for WM25.|`|Um7mYM71aa	No,he is in TNA.|`|NPbSdQ1Paa	He will|`|aULZ8D10aa	I hope he goes back to tna.|`|yGpvN7Noaa	yes around august april or march|`|j9GokH9Qaa	okay this is probably the hundreth time answering this question.. Yes he will be returning.. The only reason he didn't return during Royal Rumble is because there was a change of plan.. If you didn't know he was backstage during the royal rumble.. but the WWE wanted it to be unpredictable and saved Christian for later.. Since all the spoilers said Christian will be returnin and many people in the crowd were chanting We Want Christian they changed their plans.. Now he is most likely to return during No Way Out or in the weeks to Wrestlemania.. He will be in a Wrestlemania match for sure.. He signed a WWE contract 2 weeks ago...|`|U6tE9LhJaa	who knows|`|3nN1vTTuaa	it's my opinion that he will return at wrestlemania for this match:    Matt Hardy & Edge vs. Jeff Hardy & Christian  in a tlc match|`|B8cf1k5Oaa	Yes It Was Confirmed By Dixie Carter And If You Don't Belive That Check Wikipedia It Says He Signed Just Yet To Debut|`|qCt3yUNlaa	He hasn't signed back with TNA or signed with the WWE. No one knows yet. And stop listening to spoiler/rumor sites.|`|ZtZqtYA8aa	he is an Free agent right now|`|QedraJX9aa	he isnt signed with WWE|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Christian will return sometime between No Way Out and wrestlemania and didn't anybody read the interview Dixie Carter said in bleacherreports? She said that he was the first superstar from wwe to jump to tna and the first superstar to jump back which obviously means that he signed with the wwe. Christian couldn't return at the Royal Rumble because his 30 or 90 day contract didn't end yet and it was way too obvious because people were saying we want christian and holding welcome back christian signs. This is just like the time when Chris jericho was about to return when some people thought he would go to tna and some others said he would be returning to the wwe. Also somewhere in wikipedia under international something it showed on the top wrestlemania 25. Also Pro wrestling or something i heard say that christian has returned to the wwe. Like the joker said he probably signed with wwe a couple weeks ago. Also people if Dixie Carter herself say that he went back than i guess he went back right? I mean this in no offense to anybody's opinion and some people might have a point saying that he might go back to tna but going to the wwe just seems much more likely and i believe wwe has already made christian's wrestlemania plans. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.|`|iCOfWvZHaa	Here look at this site.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1279975/     Look for christian or jason russo on the cast.

That two stars would are really talented and it would give CM Punk a chance to turn heel. I also have a feeling Bourne would go over and win the IC title.    Really thumbs down? For no reason at all.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	When Kennedy gets back...and when Christian returns. Well, that would be an interesting feud. Both have great mic skills. Both can wrestle. I can see them having a lot of chemistry too. I'm looking forward to the possibilities. They are both loaded with Charisma. It will be interesting. I can see them both gaining a lot of fans from it. It can also get them both on the right start to the main events. Maybe, feud with someone else after a nice long feud...then find one another in the main events again. Of course with others involved, but it can work. :)|`|DfPyyDssaa	Cody Rhodes vs his brother Dustin.After the Royal Rumble it may be possible.|`|Pne371ESaa	well i think of Kofi Kingston and CM Punk as mid carders though the top mid carders. so i want to see Punk turn heel and feud with Kofi.|`|wcCM7y7Jaa	Umaga and Manu|`|36f4ed6b3ca00e86f38ea184368c3004aa	mvp and mr kennedy that would be a great match.|`|A7PkhsDJaa	Jamie Noble and Dolph Ziggler feuding|`|lkw5ZyDIaa	jamie noble vs the brian kendrick

f9soMMuiaa	Practice and experience. Practice will make you get use to executing with little preparation. Experience will help you learn to anticipate people making surprising passes to you, though that's not so much reaction.|`|9cub6mMQaa	Reaction, there aren't too many drills that help there. One of the best is to stand face away from someone (friend, dad, mom, brother, sister) have them pass the ball to you and yell "NOW" when they throw the pass. You'll have to turn around and catch the ball. As far as catching the ball outright - the best drill sounds kinda stupid, but it's juggling. Teach yourself to juggle using tennis balls. It's not hard and tennis balls won't break everything in sight. It teaches you to have soft hands, concentrate on the catch while not necessarily completely looking the ball into your hands. Plus, it will only cost you three tennis balls.|`|NcwD9XSHaa	1. bounce it off the floor so it will hit the wall, then catch it.  2. throw it against the wall and catch it  3 have three or more friends stand around the circle and pass it to each other as quick as you can do it.|`|VHphDgrhaa	to improve reaction time have people slap you when you least expect it and have them improve your time somehow.    super glue for ball catching.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Resin|`|tbpNk6rBaa	I think what the first person ment was Rosin. That will help you in gripping and catching. It might not help your reaction though. The only way you can fix your reaction is by paying attention and being alert because you never really know when the ball may come to you.

hwaBhUzJaa	A driver is designed to hit the ball further than a fairway wood. It is not necessary to have one, but it could save you some strokes.    I hit my driver about 200, by 3 wood about 150. The first par 3 on my home course is 140 from the front tee. If I used my driver I would be over by 50 yards. Instead, I use my 5 wood to drive to the green. I cannot hit any of irons that far so it would cost me a stoke to get on the green w/o a wood.|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	The differance is distance, how it is used, and when it is used.  Most golfers will never hit a driver off of the fairway (referred to as driving off the deck).  And some golfers even have trouble hitting a wood off the fairway as well.  It is just personal preferance.  Depending on the course I play I might leave my 5 wood out, and possibly put a differant iron in the bag that day.  You can have any clubs you want for a round, just don't exceed 14 clubs in your bag (against the rules of golf).  The simple answer is this...if you don't want a wood in your bag...leave it out.  However as a recreational golfer I would probably reccomend one for the distance.  If you are having trouble hitting a fairway wood...take a lesson.  Good luck.|`|svbFM4Zyaa	No not really necessary because if it were you would already have one. Chances are you would not like them or that you wouldn't use them so why bother.|`|AA10124869	Because the face of a driver is much larger, it is much more difficult to hit it consistently well compared to a fairway wood (say a 3 wood). At least this is the case for me and I've heard many of my golfing buddies say as much too.|`|F65Km3Coaa	giggity|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	No it is not necessary at all.  But understand that if you want to be at all competitive there are distances that only a fairway wood will cover unless you want to use an Iron twice.|`|RDbEA4zbaa	A driver is designed to hit the ball further than a fairway wood.   Fairway is designed to hit the ball accurate.  make sure what is suitable for you before choose them.  www.ebayoyo.com

NJCd95W0aa	Really, you could enter with 0 (82 otl's) and not enter with 400 (incredibly pathetic defense).    A team doesn't enter the playoffs based on goals for/goals against. A team enters the playoffs based on their wins/losses/overtime losses record relative to other teams in their conference. You get 2 points for a win, 1 for an overtime loss, and 0 for a regulation loss.    Team A could have 200 goals for and 100 goals against, while team B could have 100 goals for and 200 goals against - but if team B had more points than team A, they would finish higher in the standings.|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	a lot|`|O5Q4GP59aa	Well, you only need one goal and that is to win the Stanley Cup.|`|2iuZdBXraa	43 and 2 yaks.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	It really doesn't matter what matters is the standings.You have to be in the top eight in your conference to make the playoffs if your not then no playoffs.|`|hHXG8ef6aa	Well, when you first make the playoffs you will need to pass 4 rounds in order to win the cup.     so 1st goal to pass the conference quarter-finals  2nd goal is to win the conference semi-finals   then 3rd goal is win the conference finals  lastly to make it to the stanley cup finals and win the stanley cup!|`|UoUaO52taa	Enough to get you enoguh points to secure at least an 8 seed in your confrence|`|g9oKDTZtaa	2 goals and 1 cup|`|oJsrGmmPaa	I speak English.|`|dGbBy1xmaa	uhm more than the other teams... :P  depends on the wins/loss section just like the answer above says,  more goals ---> more wins ---> better chances of making it to the playoffs|`|4JOG5qB1aa	To the person who said it above, who says you can enter the playoffs with 82 OTL's that 82 points.  That's not close to enough in today's game.  90 is at least the cut off line.    You don't need a required amount of goals to enter the playoffs.|`|XI2iylR4aa	Just enough.  It varies from division to division, and from year to year.
DOVbF4Piaa	Stay away from the Schwinn Seneca it's a bike made for department stores and is not worth buying  You need to go to a bike shop and get fitted or go to this site and figure out what size you need.    http://www.coloradocyclist.com/bikefit    Add another $100-200 and get a bike from here.    http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/road...|`|QteysqyJaa	Real or serious Road Bikes are usually not measured as S, M or L as their Mountain counterparts. Road bikes require a more specific geometry and are measured between 48 up to 62 in 2 cm increments (there are exceptions but this is the general rule). For example I'm 5'9' and use a 54 cm frame. Base on your size you could be using a 60 or 62 frame size. However you have to take torso measurements and the best place to do so is a local bike shop. Try to be attended by a Roadie (someone with expertise on Road Bikes since you woulnd buy a Ferrari from a 4x4 salesman). As for the Schwinn Seneca here are my personal opinion after 20 + years of bike riding. Mega Retailes sell toys not Bicycles.. stay away from them!! You may spend a little extra cash getting the lesat expensive bike at a local bike shop hpowever youll be doing a much better deal.|`|c2b4f2c9fe643129d284d8728194ae6aaa	here is what someone said on amazon    ===  At 6'2" I am comfortable on the Large version but probably wouldn't be if I were much taller. This was a major concern for me because of the ambiguity of "Medium" and "Large" listed. My estimation using other sources is: Medium - 5'5"-5'10"/30-32" inseam and Large - 5'10"-6'3"/32-34" inseam.   ===    i;d guess, no, it won;t work    i also think the bike is a piece of junk      wle|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Frame fit is the most important part of selecting a bicycle. Best done at a local bike shop with a good selection of sizes and knowledgeable assistance.     What are your riding objectives? Racing, casual, touring? Kinda need to know when selecting the ride.    As for cost, expect to pay between $800 and $1500 for a decent road bike. The skies the limit from there.    Another approach is go with the large, cheap box store bicycle for the learning experience it'll be. Then if you decide to stick with cycling, sell the cheap bike and get what you really want.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	you'd probably do well with a 60cm frame. i'm 6-1 use 58cm finding good cheap roadbikes is hard. you could look at a mtnbike 19-20". put street tires on it, just an idea. good luck.|`|Fx5BENIxaa	60/62 cm frame would fit you im guessing a 62 cm but different people have different dimensions. Go to your local bike shop and try some, have them size you up, because if the road bike doesn't fit you right it might be a horrible experience.

On the other hand, that airsoft gun is part of a fairly small production run which is built (by airsoft standards) to extremely high qulaity.

They should put it on a network like Vs. or Spike that is geared toward that sort of thing.|`|lWy5M1x9aa	im very interested in the hardy storyline.  and Edge is ALWAYS entertaining to watch. plus if Swagger vs. Dreamer comes to fruition, that would be good.  but above all, the MITB ladder match will tell you whos on the way up, im liking John Morrison to win the contract.
brd6l4MAaa	While I haven't caught much of Cherry recently, he tends more toward hyperbole and sensationalism than a balanced and reasoned perspective. I always take what he says with a grain of salt and a few ounces of humour.     Cherry also seems to be more prone to take on an easier target. I don't know if he's ever called out Iginla for fighting with a visor.    http://www.hockeyfights.com/fights/47685    (Granted Iggy doesn't fight with the visor all of the time, but if you search, there have been quite a number of incidents where he has.)|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Keep in mind that part of Don Cherry's act is to increase ratings for Hockey Night in Canada! Also, who did he ever beat? Don Cherry couldn't win a Stanley Cup with Bobby Orr healthy and in his prime!|`|JHcqLEJUaa	I would tend to agree, but the way the fight started changes the way you have to look at Clutterbuck.  First of, you have the cheap shot from behind on Clutterbuck.  Then as he gets up he is jumped from behind.  He goes on to do well in the fight.  Props to Clutterbuck for even getting back up.  As far as the "buttercup" insult, I guess Cherry nothing better to do than run his mouth.  F@ $ Cherry.  Clutterbuck is a tough guy, and he gets under players skin.  I guess this time he got under Cherry's.|`|x9GODf8eaa	I did not see any of the incidents, but going by Clutterbuck's explanation of his actions, I would have to agree with him. The fact that he was willing to fight, and also willing to remove his helmet (according to his interview in that article) against Yandle tells me that he is a tough guy. Cherry has always been outspoken, sometimes giving his opinion on minimal evidence. He may have just blown it out of proportion.    As for the other article, I can't believe the kid got fired for talking to Cherry. That seems a little ridiculous to me. I don't, however, think Cherry should (its over now, I don't know if he did or not) mention the incident on the air. It would just cause a big controversy, something that the league does not need right now. We need to attract attention to the good parts of the game, not the bad.|`|lYnkvRASaa	Gota love his quote, I guess most guys who get 5 would accept 2    "Clutterbuck said he would have accepted a two-minute boarding minor. "    Actually evrytime I see his name I don't think buttercup, My brain tends to change the first T to an S and B becomes a F.
aNnmH3R4aa	WOW bro....I didn't expect this from you!!!  I mean...weren't you one of the guys who always said that rankings never matter and the people who make this ranking are on crack??  Just because America was on top?  Now you say they are pretty accurate?  Se ve que eres chiva verda?  O se ve que los Chivistas son ....how do you say....    HYPOCRITES?    EDIT:  Well bro...thats why I said that I didnt expect this from somone like you!  I based my answer on this...    "Chivas en la posicion numbero 49. No por ser Chivista but I think the rankings are pretty accurate this time."      I mean....how can anyone say they are accurate to being with?  The people who make this list.....who says they are right to begin with?  The reason why I said I didnt expect this from you...is because to someone who knows football like you do....and has a great knowledge of their team unlike the many kids here who are not even the legal drinking age....this rankings shouldnt matter to you.  This shouldnt be a topic to be discussed....even when America was on top!  We all know those rankings are always questionalbe just like the national team rankings!  How many years has it been since Mexico beat the USA?  Yet the fifa ranking always put Mexico over the US and the US fans always said....those rankings are screwd up and dont matter.  Yet when a few months ago when the US was over Mexico....they were in here rubbing it in our face......so what?  Now they do matter?    And you know that when I talk trash to the Chiva fans....its aimed at those kids that without the help of the internet....they wouldnt know crap about their team!    Your one of the few people who I respect for their knowledge of the game and for calling things for what they are!|`|7Xridrxaaa	this is a total joke haha and i admire Chivas but come on they got the first 10 totally wrong!|`|Yb0182Vxaa	wtf didn't IFFHS just do one like last month?|`|Jqlfj74Oaa	i expect americanistas to say they are a joke, BUT they always use thoses rankings to try and prove memo is better than every gk in mexico...|`|smeaQXafaa	This is a complete joke.  Barcelona should be number 2.  Come on now.  Atlas is not better than america.  boca estudiantes sao paola shouldn't even deserve to be in the top 50|`|HZ8KkQKWaa	most of the time this rankings are right but now they are wrong...the IFFHS stands for International Federation of Football History & Statistics...which mean they count what a team has won in the last 20 years    as you can tell AMERICA has won the most in the last 20 years so they should be first in mexico    if they were fifa rankings(which are based in current events) then i would not have a problem...yes america should not be first in mexico but the problem is that this rankings are not about current events    you can tell they are wrong because ATLAS is first....wtf what have they won in the last 20 years?.....nothing      EDIT:WHAT YOU FORGOT TO SAY THIS RANKING ARE FOR JUST THE PRESENT RANKINGS(SO I GUESS CHIVAS SHOULD BE FIRST)    http://www.iffhs.de/?10f42e00fa2d17f7370...    THE ALL TIME RANKINGS (WHICH ARE MORE IMPORTANT) AMERICA IS STILL FIRST SO NO WORRIES     http://www.iffhs.de/?3d4d443d0b803e8b403...|`|LAdeGGGFaa	America will always be the best in Mexico.|`|JiKNOtvdaa	First of all I agree that Chivas is the best Mexican team in the world, second of all how can  Barcelona be in 3rd place when they've only lost like 3 games with Pep Guardiola|`|4a3c4c50a6a9e82506477f10b7f1fbdfaa	i do think chivas is the best MEXICan team...      BUT the list is so inacurate!     Boca better than most top european teams? i dont think sooo...|`|DO7nz8aRaa	i dont agree with chivas being at the top im not saying theyre the worst though but at least america is on there|`|QcEcylBvaa	I 70% agree with this. America the best team of Mexico in the last 29 years. I kind of agree with that.|`|b4uCTRABaa	I think cruz azul should be right next to chivas because cruz azul when to two finals|`|1GpHnVHwaa	hmmm?? Cruz Azul hasn't beaten America in 6 years.  When was the last time America beat Morelia? Morelia should not be up there but I think Cruz Azul is way better than America..|`|qbPbvLuLaa	I agree Chivas should be considered the best team in Mexico but most of the list is wrong. Sometimes they overrate teams and sometimes they underrate teams.|`|MMTZuSY8aa	I understand what are you trying to get at. Your just saying that the rankings are accurate because they reflect what has been happening on the field. Guadalajara is at a good moment so they are ranked higher than the struggling America.     Though this is somewhat hypocritical, because you are agreeing that they are accurate "No por ser Chivista but I think the rankings are pretty accurate this time." You are using the rankings to defend your point, I know that the rankings don't mean anything to you but you used them to rove a point. Point taken.|`|AoynQR2Haa	...and thats how it should be.  :]|`|A2puqgbTaa	I aint gonna hate but i remember when America was number 10  lol like two years ago tho|`|kDp78N8iaa	Eh I don't really pay attention to these rankings.....not very accurate and to get in the top positions you know you gotta do good in international tournaments. And we all know what happened to Chivas last time, right? Yeah Four camotes up theirs ;)......and America doing bad in the local tournament archived the "Maracanazo" and got eliminated because of the away goal rule, remmeber the global score was 1-1 against Quito.     Pretty funny that you take the rankings seriously now that chivas is on top :P|`|XvjXrCffaa	I'm not gonna use these rankings like americanistas.  But haha toma americanistas|`|PowkYTGJaa	Hell yeah man!! Its all about Chivas!! Chivas is in posicion 49 now imagine where there gonna be when we win the Clausura and La Libertadores...Chivas for real have been doing really good with young players and havent even spend 20 million dollars or getting a highly overpayed coach (*cough*  like America) I mean seriously im happy with my Chivas but I think Chivas goal should be getting on Sao Paulo and Boca Juniors level cause I know they can do it!!|`|xtmQ7vksaa	All i gots to say is "On ur face Amierdicanistas!!"    Paque ya no esten chingando que no les hemos ganado en 6 a?os and making hella BS up!!     CRUZ AZUL is better then you guys!!    *Yup i agree with you ticallionstallion, but i think that Cruz Azul should be side by side with Chivas since they did really good last year. But on the other hand, maybe not since they didn't get a lot of activity on International competitions.|`|Cpm25Pekaa	Typical chivista, when America was the best, you guys were saying, "no rankings don't matter."    Well it doesn't affect me, even if America is the best team of the world.  We have to prove it in Mexico.

YDpT2ClBaa	1. thats up to the principal  2. this depends on, if it was during school hours, and what the school considers there area.  where i went to school if we fought by the places that were off school grounds but were usually places for hangout and lunch we were suspended.   also consider you can get arrested for this. even though you both agree to the fight. it is considered assault.   you can also get arrested for this on school grounds if the fight is bad enough.   3. yes you can get in more trouble for this.  4. see   2    fighting will not solve you problems.    if a person is shallow enough to leave you for someone else, then he was not your to begin with, and would have left you anyway down the road.   you should thank her for saving you the trouble of being with this person and wasting your time with them.|`|9ZwFQadRaa	1.

Cheers    Good luck and kick her ***. :)|`|Y95TGph4aa	1. probably not: in most schools no  2: yes, or at least you could in pa  3: yes, unless u try and escape the fight, u are a willing participant and will be treated as so  4: no but think about cops, fights really are a serious thing  But seriously, fights are stupid, especially when girls fight. You dont look tough at all you just look like a *****, which isn't cool|`|GFD4gf3Zaa	I'm in eighth grade too, and I think that this girl needs a lesson, but depending upon how big she is you should face her yourself. you will probably get in trouble regardless, but if you face her yourself, you won't get you friends in trouble, and you won't get in as much trouble either...     1. it depends upon the principle  2. if you're principle found out  3. yes, most definitely  4. I don't know, it depends on the district|`|tZXHSxkQaa	I would like to give you a bit of a grammar lesson first,I realize you don't like this other girl but,you should always announce all others before yourself(this girl and I/me,my two friends and I/me),this is the proper way to say it.This:"told her thats it we wanna fight her".Should read:told her that we want to fight her. Are all you girls in P.E. together?If so,try to be sure this one girl is on the other team for dodge-ball,so you or your friends can throw the ball in her direction,accidentally hitting her in the nose.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	...Exactly how do you steal a guy? He went to her of his own free will, it's not her fault. You don't have one good reason to fight. Fighting should only be used in self defense.    P.S. Bringing friends is a very cowardly move.

avhgLEu8aa	That's how it should be. All British football (soccer) leagues have that system.  Quite often the top teams in the lower leagues can stay in the top league for a couple of seasons, maybe longer, and it brings in more money for them. Not only that, it gives the teams something to fight for if they realise they might end up being promoted or relegated.|`|L77OlY1naa	Well if there wasn't already so much talent not being signed then yes it would be practical.I think they need to add another team to the NL West.To expand the talent that is going either sit in AAA or go acrossed seas|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	No, that's just stupid. Like last year Mariners were one of the worst teams yet they have one of the best players in the league, Ichiro.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Noo cuz if that happend then the minor league teams will come up and get clobbered.

Unfortunately though it just would never be possible, every team in AAA is owned by a big league club, and they shipplayers back and forth all year, but they couldnt do that if they were now a rival MLB team, also the stadiums wouldnt work for AAA teams, plus the owners of of MLB teams have too much power to ever let that happen.    so its an interesting thought, but it will never be more than that|`|yk4S7uuraa	That doesn't work here. Thats a stupid move.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Now THAT would be a great idea. Maybe the two bottom teams in each league. Then the best teams in AAA get sent up. Of course it would be hard since those teams are owned by Major league teams. But it would be cool.|`|c54de16e5f66dbc2f55be03fb63b269faa	KANSAS CITY AND THE ORIOLES ARE GOING TO THE AAA THEN! HAHAHA|`|12JCF1Wkaa	If there was two of the worst teams that got sent to AAA I would send the Washington Nationals, and Baltimore both teams just suck no matter what they do each year!|`|kaaP8y2oaa	its all rubbish...|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think the owners would be against it.

Matt, what happened to him  Underated  gray, agree  Kenny, i dont think pple under rate him  Dan, same  Mike, agree  Marcus, agree  Matt, needs to move a little faster  Joe, overrated|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	Here are some under rated ones:    Brock Lesnar - This guy gets dissed from the Kimbo effect, but he's a different beast.  He is a very skilled wrestler and his physicality is amazing.  People who knock him now are going to be eating crow when he still has the belt two years from now.  Mark my words, he will annihilate Frank Mir.    Tyson Griffin: This guy should be in line for the light weight title.  At the top of his game, he will be a threat to BJ Penn.    Over rated:  I'm going to go with Lyoto Machida.  I know, he's 14-0 and he schooled Thiago Silva who I thought was going to wreck him, but IMHO he isn't so much a great fighter as an unusual one with a unique strategy.  There will be a "trick" to beating him, and once someone exposes it, he's in deep trouble.  New strategies are powerful things.  Royce Gracie had a trick to him and for a while he was invincible.  But over time it was exposed and by the time he fought Matt Hughes he got crushed.  There was a trick to beating Tyson in the 80s and once that was out he ceased to be an effective boxer.  Machida is the same.|`|u93eagkqaa	Overrated: Chuck Lidell, Brock, Diego Sanchez, Wandy. Kid Yamato    Underrated: Damien Maia, Frankie Edgar, Lyoto Machida|`|vDky5V15aa	There really is only one name that sticks out as overrated to me; Fedor Emelianenko.    Fedor, though once one of the best, is aging. He hasn't fought a real contender in over 4 years. His conditioning is obviously lacking and he was getting out boxed by a UFC castoff until Andre Arlovski made a stupid mistake.     He needs to get over his pride (literally and metaphorically) and take an exclusive deal with the UFC to fight the best heavyweights. Otherwise there will always be doubt about how great he is.     Affliction is a 2nd rate promotion and he is the big dog. One has to wonder how he would fare against the likes of Lesnar, Mir, Gonzaga, Couture, Kango and even newer guys like Carwin.     Personally, I think Fedor is afraid of the cage and will never step foot in one.|`|4gwSrPhfaa	I disagree with almost every fighter u have said is over rated save for Parisyan, Silva, and serra,     underrated guys include Fedors lil bro Alex, Hellboy Hansen, Aoki ( his style and pants maybe really gay but he has the wins to back up the pants) ,|`|925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	Rashad Evans hands down.  Evans has been fighting bigger people in so many of his fights.      Lesnar.  Everyone thinks he is crap and has no skills.  While it's true that he is a newbie and that he lacks skills in many areas, he is an excellent wrestler and is much better at using his size advantage than other big men like Choi.  Once he beats Mir, which I think he will, people will take him seriously.  I do not think he is ready for Fedor.  He needs more fights and practice in avoiding mistakes.  Once he gets more experience, if he continues to train hard, I am predicting a very very tough fight for Fedor, IF he ever fights Fedor.|`|65PS8shGaa	rashad is not overrated

1Z0Lmrk1aa	Actually Odom has been stepping up of late. Jackson asked him to be more offensive minded and its been paying off. So he is just going to have to step it up a notch. As for the clown who thinks Kobe is the problem, thanks for showing me what little knowledge it is that you have of the game.|`|keUqPWVuaa	The reason they asked Odom to come off the bench was the hope that by playing him fewer minutes they may actually get the few minutes he actually plays...LOL|`|fb8wjOxnaa	Why would he step up now? Odom is the most frustratingly inconsistent player in the league. He's been in the league what now 8 or 9 years, if the talent was really there you would have seen on a nightly basis by now.|`|FFjxwBHyaa	i dont think he can do it....bynum is a natural center but he injured and gasol gotto play center and odom start in forward...i think this is not a very good formation against strong team....|`|uxregJ0faa	He should.

c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	http://mmajunkie.com/news/13895/kizer-pe...    A far better source of info than Cofield.    It should be a reprimand for the cornermen, but their are no grounds to overturn the decision, and it's on GSP's corner, not GSP.    The commission noticed it, stopped it and guess what, the fight didn't change at all.    I can bet that the commission will be eyeing him for the rest of his career, but other than a fine or revocation of licence for the cornermen, this issue is dead.    Looks like carelessness to me given Kizer's explanation. No less illegal but no malicious intent.|`|u93eagkqaa	It doesn't matter what you think about if GSP would have won anyway. His team cheated.    George Brett got thrown out of a game for having too much pine tar on his batt. He probably would have still hit that homerun without it, but that's not the point he cheated.    Barry Bonds would have still hit all those homeruns without the steroids, but that's not the point he cheated.    GSP cheated how the hell could you not tell someone rubbing vaseline on you?     I don't even care who won that fight, but GSP cheated and him and his corner will have to pay for that.|`|mKLQ1OR9aa	Looking at the footage, GSP should serve some sort of penalty. Perhaps forfeit the purse from the fight. But what also should happen is that his cornerman should serve at least a one year ban for being in anyone's corner.   For the type of fighter that BJ Penn is, the fight was completely lopsided in GSP's favor. Maybe this why he had such and easy time. Hopefully he'll man up and offer BJ a rematch before he fights Thiago Alves.|`|vDky5V15aa	I believe GSP unintentionally cheated. Just like an unintentional knee to a grounded opponent or a poke in the eye.     The way this should be handled, would be to have the bout declared a no contest. Then reschedule the rematch for a later PPV. Maybe at the end of the year after both GSP and Penn defend their respective titles.     The corner man who was guilty of the infraction, should be sanctioned and be barred from participating in any more of  GSP's fights.|`|565e59859509346cd803ff29a2a4622baa	Yes his corner was guilty of the vaseline infraction.  Whether he had anything to do with it or not is being investigated.  I believe it may have helped him out when BJ was trying to submit him and had a few attempt setup perfectly but his legs slid off of GSP's shoulders.  While GSP may have dominated the fight, all it takes is falling into one submission move and you can lose it all.     A lot of people are saying BJ was not prepared for the fight, but you have to remember he's packing on an extra 20 pounds to his frame to fight in that class and the only way to do that is to consume more calories and/or reduce your caloric output during training.  GSP was at his natural weight BJ had to put on 20 pounds of mass and it wasn't lean muscle mass which he may be incapable of putting on that much without the use of a banned substance.      I agree that the fight should be a no contest and a rematch should take place, and possibly a refund for the fights because the only excitement came via the Machida knockout on Thialgo.|`|9NDL5YQJaa	Vaseline is legal to put on the eyebrows at the start of the fight and in between rounds.  What happened was that he rubbed his shoulders and back with residual vaseline.  That can make him more greasy and thus harder to submit with a triangle or other choke.      GSP dominated the fight and I don't think it had any outcome on the fight.  But GSP's corner screwed up big time.|`|gBO908P6aa	I do not believe there was intentional cheating going on, a minor oversight perhaps.  The cornerman, Kru Phil Nurse, was simply applying it to GSP's face but he didn't put gobs of that stuff on GSP's body.  GSP would have had to be dipped in Vaseline to create any real slippery effect.  Not to mention he was covered in sweat.  I've administered Vaseline and Vapo-rub to a person's back before a massage on many occasions and I've always made sure to wipe dry first before expecting the stuff to stick.  Nurse was administering a quick rubdown and some pressure point technique to pep GSP's energy back.    Keep in mind also that in Muay Thai, which Nurse teaches, it's not uncommon for fighters to get oil rubdowns.  Perhaps he was doing it out of natural instinct as he has done so many billion times before, rejuvenating the fighter with a quick massage and chi gung-ish techniques.  He probably didn't realize that you just can't do that with any Vaseline on your hands.  That's when some guards got antsy and wiped GSP down.  Did Vaseline cause BJ's head to bobble around after GSP landed a beautiful cobra punch?  Did Vaseline give GSP superhuman abilities to pry his legs out of BJ's half guard to dominate him in the crossbody?  Did Vaseline cause BJ's defenses to mysteriously fall asleep for several rounds?  Unlikely.  GSP looked fresh and powerful while BJ looked like a man who just got out of bed at the last moment.  The worst they can probably do is oust or fine Nurse but the evidence shows GSP clearly dominated BJ in that fight.|`|pHhICD6Baa	His cornerman should be punished.    Does it look intentional? Kind of.. not really.    I've watched the fight over 4 times now, and at the beginning of rounds 3 and 4, you can see the guys in the maroon coats wipe him down before each round.    If anything, the person who performed the witch doctor thing, shouldn't have also been the vaseline guy.    But did it effect the fight? I think hardly.|`|TH1fT6rdaa	Yes, they cheated.  But no, it did not affect the outcome of the fight.    Vaseline on the face helps prevent breaking the skin, which in turn minimizes chance of  bleeding.  This is good because it helps matches from ending by bleed-out.    But, it is also obviously harder to grasp hold of a vaseline-lubricated body.  Wrestling, Jiujitsu, and all forms of grappling are more difficult on a slippery body.  Notice in the 3rd and 4th rounds, BJ Penn kept on raising his legs high on GSP's back in hopes of a submission attempt, but they kept on slipping down, possibly because of the vaseline.    GSP's corner should be punished, but I don't think GSP should.  His corner knowingly did something illegal, and should be punished likewise.  They could dip his whole body in vaseline or just his toes, but it was illegal, no matter what.  Dana White says the cornerman who actually rubbed the vaseline on GSP's body should lose his license.
5YVfVhRUaa	you should practice front flips on a trampoline or something bouncy to get used to flipped faster then flip on flat.plus before your flip i find it easier to get a running start,jump,then bounce off the ground like its a trampoline.for some reason it helps|`|k96aZXY2aa	I'm assuming that you mean a front tuck (a flip without your hands). to do this, you need to run into it jump with your arms over your head, then throw your arms and shoulders down towards your legs into a ball. make sure you don't close your eyes, and have your knees bent when you land, because (like the other person said) it is a blind landing.    for a backwards roll, you need to make sure you put your hands on the ground and push with your hands to roll all the way over. it takes your weight off of your neck and puts it onto your hands.|`|5yTnGALCaa	Take a run and then hurtle and jump up and set (Think of throwing a beachball) and then grab your legs. It's a blind landing so make sure to bend your knees. In a back flip, I wouldn't do it unless you can do it on the tramp so you won't be scared.
WUuO6wbAaa	Honestly, for the price he's looking for, I don't think so. He's said he'd retire if he doesn't get the price he's looking for. He might just wait it out and see if a team down the stretch gives him the price he wants. Kind of like Roger Clemens a couple years back.    What people aren't recognizing is that there's lots of options out there for Manny, but one of the most likely options is no team. You got the Dodgers, Giants, maybe the Mets if they're willing to trade Delgado to free up money, but beyond that, the market is thin. He'd be luck to get that 2 year/45 million deal back. There's talks that the best he can get now is 2 year/30 million. His agent probably doesn't want to see him lose money, when he wanted to opt out of 2 year/40 million left on his deal and he likely won't take less than 45 million. Chances are, the Dodgers are willing to give him that deal, but he'll still want more and just won't get it. At this point of the off-season, he's probably only going to get a one year deal now. Maybe around 20 million or so. If he signs 1 year/20 million, he can test the market again next year.    If Manny's smart, he'll sign a one year deal knowing the Yankees have 3 OF's that are free agents in the off-season, being Nady, Damon and Matsui.    The Yankees way of spending is by spending what gets shed from their payroll. Matsui and Damon are each due 13 million and Nady's due 6.55 million, so that's over 32 million. Why not just wait for them to sign him? By that point though, he probably won't be able to get another 3 year deal. But if he were to get a 2 year deal from the Yankees next offseason, isn't that as good as signing one year now and getting 2 years later?|`|WQlfmAUXaa	well today he got offered 1 year 25M so he will take his pick wen he decides to accept the offer|`|5FAW64vGaa	soon,,,he refuse the dodger 1 year offer,and sign with the Giants for 2 years.|`|HtYGxZcCaa	I dont even think Manny Ramirez will find a team by the start of Spring Training.

AVTXclXqaa	The double end bag that you are thinking about getting looks good. Just make sure it comes with 2 RUBBER cables for super fast rebounds and as far as size goes, it depends on your experience with the bag. IF ur a begginer then u should get the bigger size to make it easier to hit, but if ur more advanced then get the smaller size to make it more difficult to hit cause smaller targets are always hard to hit.

wrhRjwKaaa	I never took lessons, I taught myself, but I'm guessing that lessons won't hurt. Just make sure your back foot(usually your strong foot) does most of the work, you sort of just pivot on your front foot. and make sure that the bored is NEVER flat, it always has to be a little angled, which can be hard at first, but you'll get used to it. Once you get heelside down, (that's going down the mountain sideways with your stomach in front, and being able to turn to the right if you're goofy, or left if you're regular) make sure you start going Toeside as quick as you can, it's the toughest part, once you can go backwards(toeside) just try and switch back and forth as much as you can. Make sure you know that you're regular or goofy, don't try to learn both, I can dominate on regular, but once I go goofy, it's like i've never snowboarded before, so just stick with one and you'll be fine. Not sure what else, i'm sure the instructor will give you good tips. PS are you going to mt. hood by any chance? it's da bomb|`|x2Q5Cbbpaa	be carefull about your tailbone!|`|nxBkPPu7aa	wear safety equipment|`|92yiQo7uaa	Never drink and snowboard!|`|w5bZ8Hhqaa	You fall on your butt a lot but it is super fun.|`|8Ijjrl8baa	where are you goin?  im goin 2....  stick to the easy runs...get   where a helmet...  do not bumed when you fall...  dont waist time on the ground just ride!!!|`|axOPrPnBaa	put cushions in your back pockets and pants.|`|COnvbTP2aa	Relax and enjoy yourself.

Don't risk breaking your wrist(s) and ending your trip early.    Good luck. ^_^|`|9i4Rxqknaa	You WILL fall.

Just your front.|`|krQpHkkwaa	Just don't ever be afraid to fall....It's completely normal, although your rear end may hurt after.

1FGWFcljaa	you have one of the best mountains in the country right there, mt. bachelor, so i guess you are in luck!
8GwKUh65aa	well there are a few things, why would you be turning both ways doing a toe turn unless you are trying to ride switch sometimes? and are you goofy or regular. but if you wanna toe turn right, just make sure you get your board back down the hill after your heel turn and turn your shoulders back up hill and pressure up your toes as you know on doing a toe turn regular. and for doing a heel turn you need to turn your shoulders back down hill and put pressure on your heels. just make sure that you straighten out your board before you start to turn again.|`|kBSlNEL2aa	Turning on a snowboard is often misunderstood.  Believe it or not it is all in the shoulders.  Next time your on your board think about this and try it.  You'd be surprised at how much easier it is to do.  You being goofy footed is where your having a problem.  Don't take tips from a regular rider because it was opposite learning for them.  Try the shoulder thing and let me know how it goes.  Good luck.|`|N3qc36Ataa	You need to find the on/off switch.  Sometimes it's a switch, sometimes a button.  Older snowboards were turned on by means of a hand crank, then later a kickstart.  Today the most high tech new boards are turned on and off via voice command.  Try yelling "Snowboard On!" at your board to see if yours is equipped with this technology.  To turn it off, just press the button or switch again, or yell "Snowboard Off!" depending on your model.

Are you on a flat?  Is there a tail wind or head wind?  That's about 20MPH, -- most can do five miles at that speed. To average 50 or 60 miles at that speed is doing very well.

8m9HXnPfaa	The hockey "levels" as you refer to them chagne by country and state/province.

And it depends were you live but in Ontario it is seperated into age groups and it goes  "Juvinile" is basically 18-20 most are just a fun little recreation teams. Then Midget which is 15-17. Bantom which is 13-14, Peewee which is 11-12, Atom, 9-10, tyke 7-8, then mite and mitey mite (I heard they got rid of mitey mite though). all those ages are what the player would be at the start of the season. Minor midget (or any other age group) is a team made up first years. So minor midget would be 15 year olds and minor peewee would be 11 year olds. While Major Midget would 16&17 year olds while major Peewee would be 12 year olds.     This is were it gets really confusing. AAA (triple A) is the highest level (up until junior) then it goes AA/A (double A) then A/AA (single A) then house league BUT there are restrictions on that. Where I live the AAA team represents the county but the AA/A and A/AA represent the city but I do not live in the city. So I can try out for the AAA but If i get cut i can not try out for the AA/A team. I would have to try out for an "A" team which is technically a DD team. confused yet? There many levels such as A/E, CC, DD, EEE which do not make much sense (check the OMHA site)    Junior Hockey is 16-20. After the first year of playing midget a player can be drafted to play in the OHL (in ontario). The OHL is considerd a Junior "A" team. Player not good enough to play the for the Junior A team go onto play "Junior A Tier II" why they dont just call it junior B? I have no idea. After "Junior A tier II" it goes Junior B then Junior C then Junior D. It gets pretty Confusing I know but hopefully this explained it all    EDIT I should have specified. All the age groups except junior have divisions split up by skill, which is what AAA, AA/A and A/AA are

Ball in and Out of Play:Kick-off: following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.   Throw-in: when the ball has wholly crossed the touchline; awarded to opposing team to that which last touched the ball.  Goal kick: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by an attacker; awarded to defending team.  Corner kick: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a defender; awarded to attacking team.  Indirect free kick: awarded to the opposing team following "non-penal" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or send-off an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. A goal may not be scored directly from an indirect free kick.   Direct free kick: awarded to fouled team following certain listed "penal" fouls  Penalty kick: awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.[  Dropped-ball: occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.

I've played soccer for many years, and it is tough you don't have any time outs (unless in the case of an injury) so that means that you will be running for 40 to 45 mins straight. You must also learn to develop skill with the ball.If you think you can handle it you will have so much fun. If running is not for you then you should try a different sport. Soccer is probably the toughest sport to play. At first practice will be difficult and you will be sore, and you might want to quit. Just keep going give it at least a month or 3 weeks to get a feel for the sport. It gets easier as you play it longer.     And you don't have to join a sport. If sports aren't for you then that's OK. You don't have to do something that you don't enjoy.    Well Good Luck|`|Y5v6bGJMaa	Wow, this can be a long one. The main part about soccer is just learning what not to do. Like penalties and stuff. Learning what you should do is something that comes with experience in the game. As you play more and more you'll find yourself getting more used to the stresses it can on your body.  If this is your first time playing I'd recommend that you go to as much practice as you can and try to play at a park with friends when you can. The biggest difficulty is finding your position. In every sport players find that one place on the field/court that they excel more at. You'll have to be flexible about where you play but soccer is a sport that's easy to learn over time and can really be a lot of fun.      I do recommend that you find an online website that'll show you basic soccer rules. It doesn't matter how good you get at the sport if you don't know the rules. In general they're fairly simple it's just a matter of remembering them while you play.      Best of luck to you.

7gFpQB4faa	Rooney helped get Obama elected.  Maybe he was returning the favor??    Just kidding.    But the Cardinals did get a good screwin'.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	It was rigged pretty badly, considering they took a TD away from the Steelers in the first quarter and then called them for a holding penalty in the endzone which negated a play which nearly iced the game and gave the Cards a safety and put them back into the game.|`|oYsSL991aa	Yes it was rigged.  The refs did all they could to let the Cardinals win.  Taking away Roethlisberger's TD when he clearly broke the plane and the phantom holding call in the end zone that gave the cardinals a safety.      Still, they should have looked at the last play (even though it looked like a fumble to me)|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Whiny Cardinal fans. For the last time, his feet were down, he broke the plane and it was fumble at the end of the game. I think that covers most of the assumed mistakes. They always review any play from the last two minutes of any half in the review booth. If they had seen anything that warrented overturning the call they would have stopped the game from the booth and over turned it. Please take your Cardinal colored glasses off.    I can't believe Card fans are making me stick up for Steeler fans???    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|tJa60S4Taa	the refs seemed like they were somewhat biased toward the steelers, yes|`|AA10939368	What game were you watching?    The ball is not considered a prop, therefore it is not a penalty.  They could have gotten one for overcelebration, but then they did not call it against Arizona when they scored the touchdown and thought they won.      The last play was a fumble because in order for there to be an incomplete pass, his arm needs to be in forward motion with the ball.  Neither had occurred, the ball had already been stripped.    You must be the only person who did not see Holmes feet inbounds with full control of the ball.  Every sports analyst on television saw it.  Even Kurt Warner stated today what a tremendous catch he made.      Ignorance is a terrible thing, learn the rules in the NFL and then come  back and complain when you know what you are talking about.|`|ufr8TU6Jaa	Quit complaining, if you don't like it, watch something else. It's a football game and there's always going to be bad calls due to everyone has their own interpretation and view point perspective. So, just drop it... get over it... and look forward to next year... sheesh!|`|37PYnKr9aa	I don't think it was rigged. I was for the Cardinals, but there was some very bad play calling. However, the Cardinals play like crap having some dumb penalties and turnovers. No reason Warner should have passed the ball when they were on the 2 yardline or whatever just before half. After seeing the winning TD pass, it clearly showed both his feet inbounds. Even if it hadnt been as clear, there would of had to be more evidence to overturn the call. It sucked seeing Steelers win, but the Cardinals lost it due to penalties and turnovers. Yes there were bad calls, but I dont think that last play of the game would have made a difference. Oh well, always next year!|`|9a3fC9mOaa	Holmes feet were in, Kurt Warners arm was DEFINITELY moving forward, the calls were pretty bad.|`|HCcyja6Raa	the super bowl wasnt rigged. if it was, then the cardinals would not have had a chance to win, but they did. they could have stopped the steelers offense on their final drive. but they didnt, and they lost because of it. they didnt play a whole 60 minutes of football. even the players knew it, in all the post-game interviews with the cardinals players/organization, they didnt blame the questionable officiating, they blamed themselves. because they lost the game, therefore it was their fault.    the holmes play was really close, and as good as the technology is...it was still hard as hell to go either way and say it was definite. you need indisputable evidence to overturn a call, so they couldnt overturn it.    not reviewing the last pass is not the referees fault though, it should be blamed entirely on the replay official in the box. i was very surprised they did not review it...    although i disagree with the NFL's celebration policy, according to the rules, it should have been a penalty.    the NFL disappoints me most in the way they go about handing out fines...this year has been ridiculous...clearly some players deserved fines (i think harrison deserves a large one after he punched and decked antonio francisco) but there were many players this year that were fined for typical things...|`|jisJ1Bj3aa	haha some of you steeler fans are so clueless, its like you didn't even watch the game.    Everybody can agree that Holmes had 2 feet and possession, so stop using that as an example of the refs being good. That was probably the best call of the game.|`|pSOrIUYsaa	http://www.steelertribute.com/  Look at this picture, that's all I have to say about Sanantonio Holmes' touchdown.  Not only that, he used the ball as a prop. That plus the 15 yard penalty AT THE MINIMUM. Cardinals would have gotten the ball AT about the 50 yard line, that and with two time outs with 30 ticks left. WE HAVE A BALL GAME!  Now the issue of the last play not being reviewed (I personally think Kurt Warner's arm was moving forward), and the booth should have called it I MEAN COME ON the circumstances were so HUGE! If it was over-ruled it would be at the 29 yard line with the penalty with 15 ticks left so it no longer becomes a hail marry, they proved they could move the ball by the 2 previous plays. Larry Fitzgerald was red hot, there could have easily been another touchdown. OR if they ruling stays the same; Steelers win.      In ending, the game wasn't rigged, it was over officiating the wrong parts of the game and under officiating at the WRONG parts of the game..but I wouldn't be surprised if it was..|`|NzGZbCRQaa	Why do people continue to insist the Warner fumble wasn't reviewed?!?    The play was reviewed during the commercial break and easily determined to be correctly called as a fumble. No need to drag it out for ten minutes when it was an obvious fumble.|`|d3ilADnAaa	yes I do believe the super bowl was rigged those refs were leaning towards the Steelers ( whom I dont like). I am not a Cardinals fan either. even when the cardinals almost made that touchdown when it was intercepted by  92 from the steelers to make that 100 yard touchdown. right before the Cardinals hiked the ball the steelers were offsides and the refs were too blind to see that. Arizona should have won that game.|`|oPAi65Q2aa	Holmes feet were in  Penalties were so-so  Warner arm was close  Holmes celebration shouldve been called|`|6xkkUvn5aa	NFL = the new WWE; everything is staged    and yes, Holmes should have been penalized according to the rules (that they choose to enforce extremely erratically), but it wouldn't have made a lot of difference at that point. not that I agree with the rule, but it is supposed to be the rule|`|87wtQbpKaa	Get over it, your team lost. Better luck next year.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	never never never will a superbowl be rigged    may have been bad calls but wasnt rigged|`|7WFrijvhaa	Santonio Holmes' feet WERE in thank you very much.  Dont cry. you're just mad because the steelers won !! haha  GO STEELERS ! :)    but i do agree with you, there were alot of bad calls !|`|n6NJ1e2daa	Psh. Sore loser. His feet were definately in bounds. Like by 3 inches. That and the 100 yard interception. Face it, the Cardinals lost. That's what the mayor of Pheonix gets for blowing his nose on the Terrible Towel. Maybe if the Cardinals didn't play so dirty they wouldn't have gotten so many penalties.

Especially with their newest acquisitions, they will be a threat to the Phillies and a team to be taken seriously.  Second, the Mets don't choke in the play-offs because they don't MAKE the playoffs (sorry Mets fans, just had to throw that in there).  Third, they're not cheap.  They are really making some noise in the post season and going after some semi-expensive free agents.    They choked because they had a horrible bullpen and the Phillies had some timely wins.|`|yk4S7uuraa	They had no bullpen last year, but thats been fixed.|`|liUG1m9Waa	They Mets sucked because there bullpen.  they blew 30 plus games in relief cut that in half and they got the best record    am i right?

D-Boys are really only good for cheap metal receivers to put after market parts into.|`|L8vEMlP2aa	i'd go with the echo1, considering that for its price, power and effective range, it is very efficient. not a bad option at all, also keeping mobility on the "battlefield" in mind as well.|`|WT108qwZaa	smith and weston 1911   that is waht it is called
UHTcpdkVaa	I'm still just starting out in Capoeira - but I can only train twice a week so I workout at home to try and keep up a little bit.  Since I'm so new to it, I work on basic movements and strength.  Handstands, back-bridges, and squats I try to do daily (still new enough that I can't spell baneria, pointe, or cocohenia - see!).  I do a lot of push-ups (trying to finish the hundredpushups.com challenge), trying to build up to handstand pushups.  Since you go to a class, you know that there are probably hundreds of variations of the basic calisthenics, I try to do the same things we did in the previous class.    I'm still a long way from even trying a macaco, so I tend to leave the acrobatic moves for the gym where I can have a spotter if I need one and where the mats are nice.  But basic movements seem to be working well for me, I can actually do a handstand now and when I started that seemed bloody impossible.    I also have a good book that you might like, Capoeira Conditioning.  It breaks down a series of movements that you can use to improve your game, and get a great workout.  Not nearly as fun as class, but then class isn't as much fun as roda - and you've got to train to play well in the roda - and I need to workout to do well in class :-)    At this point my main goal is to build strength and to be comfortable on my hands.  A quick set of 50 squats, 1 negative handstand push-up, falling into a bridge, doing 20 bridge push-ups, 50 reach-ups - and repeating until I die is a nice way for me to achieve this.  Most of this I got from the book - but the form I get from class.    A note to the guy who mentioned the youtube link - that was way too funny!|`|BBsR8hwLaa	Check out these two sites:  www.tricktutorials.com  www.justtheskills.com    Granted, they don't use the terminology for Capoeria, but they provide in depth tutorials on progressing into the move. Good luck!|`|YDpT2ClBaa	the same moves you practices in class.  just keep practicing the macaco until you have it down perfectly. when you have the macaco down perfect then practice it another 1000 times.    after 30 yrs of martial arts i still work and practice the basic techniques, basics is the foundation of any system with out them the advance techniques will be useless.|`|b8e1755da720b51020434b3175ed1c82aa	If you want to see a real funny Capoeira clip.

6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	With a bag lots you can do.    You can also work Sprawls, Shrimps, Bridges, Reverse Shrimps, Sit outs, Switches, and general shadow boxing.    An explosive bridge, a fast sprawl, a quick sitout or switch and a good shrimp are necessary tools and something most people without a wrestling/grappling background haven't spent enough time doing. By working them on your own constantly, you can truly help condition yourself and be more explosive in your defenses and escapes.    Working combos and strikes on a heavybag and shadowboxing are good, but not that great. You can develop bad habits without someone correct you, either verbally, or with counter strikes to show you where you are leaving yourself open at.    Work on core strength exercises too, extended situps, planks, stability ball and medicine ball exercises are all great too.    Sledge hammering a tire, as well as flipping tractor tires, throwing a medicine ball against the wall and sprawling before it gets back to you. There are a lot of conditioning things that will greatly improve your power and speed. Look to those instead of specific techniques, techniques need to come under the eye of good instructors, and sparring partners.|`|UqUqU9ceaa	ok get a muay thai bag like the last comment said and also get a grappling dummy because then you can work on some positions on the ground with it and skip shadow box things of this nature good luck|`|mmh09lXeaa	If you don't have a heavy bag at home work on your shadow boxing and shadow kickboxing   Also work on your sprawl (defense vs double leg ) and sit-out   Jumping rope is an excellent way do develop your cardio will improve your footwork    Buy a timer this can be a basic egg timer and work on shadow boxing and jumprope for 2 or 3 minute rounds with 30 seconds or one minute rest     you can also buy a workout CD/DVD combo from Bas Rutten former UFC champ http://www.basrutten.tv/mm5/merchant.mvc... a great workout|`|qACzan5Faa	the easy one is to choke hold.|`|gE0QTXNwaa	Not a pro, so getting Google help :) OK this turned up in a search:    http://ezinearticles.com/?Mixed-Martial-...      ..I typed in, "mma moves to practice at home" and 891,000 listings showed up.

But try and go to one that is from the al west like Rangers or Athletics.     Or try the Yankees or Red Sox. Its always excited to see your team win the game against a tough team. And when they are in town more of the stands are filled.    Also you might want to go when they are playing a bad team to. That way they have a better chance to win. lol  But honestly no matter what you will have fun!    GO M'S!!!!|`|b4bca8c21af83ca96ef687dca4ae6b00aa	Mariners Red Sox. But I'm a Red Sox fan.

(getting too worked up, will add preasure.)  3. be confident in urself.. believe u can do anything u set ur mind to!!  good luck and tell me how it goes!!  -ALLIE :)|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	I am scared too of balls being hit toward me! But I think the way to not be scared is to pretend that you aren't. Show no fear and eventually you will believe it. It is important to show no fear to your opponent. Make them believe you are not scared. I ran track and often got scared before a race. My stomach was always in knots, that didn't go away, even when I became really good and won a lot. The good thing is that now I know that after the race I always felt better, even if I lost. So put your game face on and remember sports are very much mind games. If you let your fear take over your brain, it will take over your body.|`|3fbZVNmnaa	Well, whenever you're doing something new, nerves are prone to turn up.  When I first played, I would miss my serves because I was so scared.  What you're going to have to do is just get used to it.  Volleyball is a very intimidating sport--especially is you have not played since you were young.  My best advice would be to just talk to your other teammates before the game about something besides volleyball.|`|7b18720ac35ea925d44408ba012ff709aa	The best way to overcome your fears is to face them head-on, figuratively speaking, of course. Go into the game thinking that you have already won. Tell your teammates to do the same. Keep the enthusiasm going by encouraging each other constantly. Give it your best shot. If, in the end, you have given it 100%, whether you win or lose the game, you will still come out a winner.|`|FFh7x8a1aa	I know this is going to sound simple but just don't be scared! i mean what is the worst it's going to do?

4Pzql73Oaa	The Championships,Wimbledon. Without a second thought.    I wait for it 50 weeks a year,and the day after the final I feel sick to the stomach regardless of the result, coz I know it's going to be a whole year until it comes around again.    From the crisp white players' outfits to the beautifully mowed grass to the bright golden sunshine,Wimbledon is by far the best Grand Slam that exists today.    I can safely say that it's the FIFA World Cup of the tennis world,a battle of passionate tennis professionals.    It would be nothing other than a dream to visit the All England Lawn Tennis Club even once in a lifetime to watch Wimbledon.    And to those who don't realize the emotions and grit, the passion and the style, the tradition and the fascination involved in the two breathtaking weeks of Wimbledon every year, **** OFF!!    I can't wait for 22.06.2009.   I know Wimbledon won't disappoint this time around.It never does,never has and never will.    Here's to Wimbledon!|`|75ZMWlnnaa	wimbledon for sure...so many great matches in the history of tennis have been produced on centre court, and besides i have personally been on the grounds of wimbledon, i find it so peaceful and relaxing.    then i like us open, aus open, and then french open.|`|6QhACK70aa	FRENCH OPEN,  BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT AND GLAMOROUS THE LAST 30 YEARS:)|`|WLkfKrkmaa	Wimbledon.

When you talk about big things in tennis you don't talk about the US, French, or Australian Open only Wimbledon and Centre Court.  Even people who could care less about tennis (what a shame) know about Wimbledon.  Unlike the other slams though nowadays grass is played on much less so it is much more special.  Great rivalries have also peaked here.  When you watch and hear about the greatest matches in tennis they usually come from Wimbledon's centre court (even excluding the Rafa Roger match).  It is definitely the most special of the four because of the heritage.|`|oojevDqmaa	Wimbledon has the history and the grass courts,They all have something different, French open - clay, Aussie open -the heat ,US the hotdogs.|`|QohItCUeaa	Aus Open- its local and ONE Day i will get there..hopefully soon  Wimbledon- Tradition,just something very classy about the All England club..cuppa tea anyone??

l4WEwTWwaa	I think he is full of ****. When it comes to boxers and cheating the trainers are always used as a scapegoat. When Mosley failed his steroid test against DLH his trainer gave him injections of what he thought was vitamins. Yes because flying from Miami Florida to Los Angeles California to take needles of vitamins makes perfect sense. He knew what they were giving him and the fact that he would even think to say I flew half way around the world to take the world's first ever injectible vitamins and insult our intelligence instead of being a man and admitting to it makes me hate him even more. As a boxer for 15 years as in Marga cheato's case he knows damn well nothing but tape goes on those hands. The whole there was only extra padding or I didn't know is crap. You have eyes you notice plaster and water being mixed and taped over your knuckles. Stop blaming your trainer, stop thinking the boxing community is retarded, and be a man and admit to it and get some of the respect you lost back. I hate Barry Bonds but I respect Giambi who owned up to his actions like a man.|`|8xyFCsMRaa	sports and cheating never go hand in hand.  however,  as what ive commented regarding this issue, it is true that cheating should never be glorified in sports but its also true that there are lots of cheaters lauded in sports history.      it seems when we like the person so much, cheating is tolerable, when we hate the guy we condemn cheating.|`|LSg84ucPaa	Agreed with Margarit, why the hell is everyone goin on him, i mean padding against steroids, which is worst? :)|`|Ef4HdzEfaa	I think he is telling the truth personally but no way anyone will ever know for sure the truth about that. We will have to wait for the investigation to be over and see what actions are taken ... for now his California boxing license is suspended. Either way it doesnt look good for him, but im sure we will see him back in the ring again in the near future. It is still unknown for sure what exactly was even in/or on his wraps the boxing commission in california still hasnt released that information to anyone. For now people can bash him all they want and say whatever they want but its all speculation , I dont think he personally should be crucified for this, being all the facts have not come out yet. People can call him margo-cheato all they want or whatever makes them sleep better at night but that still doesnt change a damn thing. Others also seem to "think" he had cheated for his past few fights as well , I personally do not. Yeah cotto was pretty banged up after that fight but thats pretty damn normal for a fighter to look like that after having a war for all those rounds. Also cintron wasnt all that banged up or mangled after his fights with margo and people say he had loaded gloves for that fight. Look back at other fights where two fighters had wars with each other for several rounds and 1 fighters face is all mangled a hell of a lot worse than cotto was ... I suppose someone had loaded gloves in all those fights too huh?|`|I9Y6fxguaa	The sole intention from Rasim Rich. was to go to margo's locker room and raise caine and to get inside Margo's head.

CGGC9UMcaa	If you have a BMX 20" then use a 16t or 17t freewheel. The 16t is the stock freewheel on new bikes usually. Though, the gear combination you choose will affect your acceleration and top speed. the smaller the gear will make you have a higher top speed while the larger freewheel will give you more acceleration.    If you want to go to a 15, 14, 13t, ect. you will need to have what's called a flip flop hub.

de6b4ddf214ab3ba18aa1aefc59d243daa	it all depends on what you class as best. winning most trophies and that's probably Alex Ferguson and he's probably the best in the way of trophies around at the moment.  Shankly and Sir Bob Paisley took liverpool from a small team to the most successful english club ever.   In terms of managers at the moment you have to look at the likes of fergie, benitez in the sheer class of their football and where they have their teams in the league.   wenger has made some awesome signings given the money he has had on offer. henry pires bergkamp spring to mind.   but one of the best in my mind is Phil Brown who took hull city up to the premier league and has (i think its safe to say) kept them there. plus some of his methods (marching the players onto the pitch at halftime to give them a kick up the ****) have been magnificent.   In short however the best manager in english football history is probs either shanks or sir bob. but the best around at the moment is fergie|`|2sIwoqRGaa	My top candidates would be Bob Paisley, Sir Alex Ferguson and Brian Clough.    Bob Paisley may have won 4 European Cups but I believe that Fergie winning 2 and the countless Premierships and other cups is a better acievement. I feel this because I believe that European football is overall a lot stronger now than in the past. Also, the number of teams he has built and nurtured has to be admired.  Clough managed to win European Cups with Forrest and his achievements at Derby were also amazing.    I personally believe in Fergie, however it's all open to debate.|`|gazpAVKfaa	Bubsy or Fergie...need look no more.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	Ruud Gillit or Avram Grant|`|020600304fdab18bd45030f27f3c19adaa	Sir Alex Furgeson|`|kxMQXhuAaa	'Sir' Bob Paisley.    6 League titles,3 European Cups,1 UEFA Cup & 3 League Cups in 9 years.|`|58HL86ATaa	BOB PAISLEY and when someone else wins 4 european cups and countless other honours then and only then can they state a claim|`|UKTJfWEzaa	Sir Alex Ferguson is the most successful on paper.

Two years later the club won the division and gained promotion to the top flight.  Derby followed that up by finishing 4th and 9th before becoming English champions in 1972.  A year later they reached the European Cup semifinals where they controversially lost to the "cheating bastards" of Juventus (Clough's own words).  So in the space of five seasons they went from a 2nd Division club to English champions to European Cup semifinalists.    At Forest Clough took over in January 1975 when the club were struggling to avoid dropping into the 3rd Division. They eventually finished 16th in Division 2.  Two years later in 1977 Clough guided Forest to the top flight when they finished 3rd in the 2nd Division.  The following season they became league champions.  A year after that they won the European Cup and successfully defended the trophy the next year.  Once again he had taken a 2nd Division side and made them English champions.  From 1976 to 1980 he turned a 2nd Division team into two-time European champions.    And in each circumstance he had limited funds and no prominant youth academy to help build his teams.      Classic Clough...    "They say Rome wasn't built in a day, but I never had that particular job."    "I may not be the best manager in the business. But I'm certainly in the top one."    Indeed.|`|5ZkGgZWSaa	Deffo Bob Paisley, apart from the fact he won countless trophies in a shorter time frame than Ferguson he had a big hand in helping setting up the winning format under Shankley.

N2PcehV4aa	The best player was Henry in terms of pure ability and athleticism, but my favourite player would be one from Bergkamp, Henry or Vieira. As you can probably tell I am an Arsenal fan, and Cesc 'absolutley' Fabregas will likely be joining my list in the next few years. In terms of favourite player from another team, that is a difficult question. The player I have most respect for however is Ryan Giggs. As much as I hate Man Utd, one can only admire his ability, personality, loyalty and longevity. Seldom do we see players stick with one club for their entire career these days, not to mention he is the most highly decorated player in Premier League history.|`|7KZepeq3aa	Cantana, Zola, Scholes|`|OAX8fXR4aa	Zola.|`|JdlkhEayaa	I'm also a LFC supporter and could quite easily say Steven Gerrard has been the best player to play in the Premiership but no, I'd say without question it has to be Thierry Henry.

uE39e0l2aa	Maybe explain the situation to your director. Honesty is always best. If she catches you in a lie, it won't be good. Or if you do choose to lie, let your parents in on it, so it won't come up in conversation later between them.|`|UEAdAuqbaa	Ask her what she has planned for that day, and if it is something important, ask her if maybe you could come on thursday or friday to learn it because you have an important prior engagement.|`|26898d87344fc67ec856f786662efe9baa	16 is young but it is also one of those "sign post" ages where you are considered a little more grown up (driving, applying for college, etc.)    If you made a commitment to be in the dance group, then you should either alter your celebration plans or be willing to be honest with the director.  If you are upfront with her, there could even be the chance that she would excuse you.  But, if she doesn't, you are going to have to decide what is more important to you.      Tough choices, but they only get tougher as we grow up.

Every year they fight for respect of the footy world, and regardless of how many times they make the eight they are never really rated as one of the more dangerous clubs, like geelong or hawthorn.     Fremantle was tipped to be in the top six last year, and they finished in the bottom four. The reason why they are rated so highly is that they are actually a good team, with great players and they are the one team in the AFL that always come close to winning and can match other more experienced/better teams for three quaters and not four. They can play matches but cant win them.|`|cklqarifaa	Well, every year the roos are written off and are classed as not having much of a chance in the coming season. Somehow however, they manage to get nicely into the eight and knock off quite a few of the front running teams in the regular season. For a few years this has been happening and every year people are surprised by how they perform. The roos dont have any real marquee players (sure wells, edwards are good players but they aren't Gary Ablett or Buddy) but their whole teams seems to gel and get them into the eight. I dont think the roos are a big threat this year, which means they will probably just miss out of the top four.|`|4wRyTY9Raa	The Kanga's will make the 8 again, it seems they always do, they get there on pure guts, what they need is a couple of superstars to take it all the way.|`|WifhQyD4aa	I'd expect them to be playing finals again in 2009|`|sjt0hdb1aa	referring to the Kangaroo's only------ get rid of Laidley and they will do better, my view is they will finish bottom 8

LUnscegvaa	Yes!!!    But most likely you will be taught the 24 form yang movement.    Then comes the Chen style which is a stepping stone from yang to self defence, there are good clubs out there,I found one and an excellent instructor but my heart is in Aikido these days so I must follow that.    Good luck and Best wishes :)***|`|apr9gsgjaa	the movements are a way of fighting but if you want true power its in the sensitivity thats picked up through pushhands to get to a high level takes decades of practice|`|YDpT2ClBaa	if you find a good instructor, then yes it can be used for self defense.  the problem is most instructor dont understand the self defense aspect of tai chi.|`|qACzan5Faa	kind of. but jit it su is better.|`|nRBC4E5saa	Just about any martial art out there CAN be for self-defense, if it's trained in a realistic manner.  T'ai Chi Chuan (the full name) translates as "Grand Ultimate Fist", and at one time that was more than just clever advertising.  However, these days it's generally trained as a health method.  I don't exactly have my thumb on the pulse of the T'ai Chi community, but I've seen good books by Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming on T'ai Chi applications that might be worth a look.  However, in all likelihood, you won't find martial application T'ai Chi in your area, just because it's so rare.|`|AA10281572	Believe it or not, TaiJiQuan starts as a balance, grace, and health exercises, then eventually progresses to some pretty hard and fast combat moves (the thinking being you build a strong foundation of fluidity of motion first).  I have seen it used as a system similar to Aikido or Judo, seen it appear much like Wushu/GongFu (non animal styles like wing chung or eight trigrams boxing) complete with fans, and of course, the legendary TaiJiQuan swordsmanship is a sight to behold and can hold its own against other weapon styles.    If you have a great deal of patience then it can be quite rewarding in the end; however, it may take a long time as many practitioners on the corners and in the parks here in China are quite old before they are able to reach that point.  But that 55 year old lady with her twin fans that practices every morning in the courtyard of my apartment complex is truly astonishing when she goes all out! (yes it's TaiJiQuan, I asked her about it, she also teaches the sword apparently but I have yet to see her use one herself)    Perhaps good things come to those who are able to wait?|`|BkTH7LiIaa	As others have already stated, Taijiquan (another spelling of tai chi chuan) is definitely a combat oriented martial art.  The origins of this art can be legitimately traced to the Chen family in Henan province, China.  Beyond that the stories blend into legend and myth.  The Chen family used this martial art (before it was even called Taijiquan, it was simply Chen family boxing) on the battlefields of the Ming Dynasty, as body guards for traveling merchants, and for defending themselves and their village.    Unfortunately, when Taijiquan was transplanted to the West much of its martial value was diluted and even lost.  This is why we have Taiji instructors who teach it only as a health and meditative exercise.  Honestly if that's all you want, you're better off with Yoga or Qigong.  But as a martial art, if you're lucky enough to find an instructor who teaches the full curriculum, then you'll be amazed at what it is capable of.  There are four categories of combat: Ti (kicking), Da (striking), Shuai (grappling, wrestling, throwing), and Na (seizing, as in qinna).  Taijiquan, if taught properly, teaches all of these categories as well as weapons.    Good luck!

The saints always bring me hope, you always hope that they will be able to turn it around again and have another great run. The hornets are amazing because of Chris Paul.

fZY8EkVDaa	No you don't have to wear a speedo.. It would be helpful if you started shaving but you don't have to come shaved (if you get into swimming then you better start) but there are 4 styles of suits for guys     Jammer (most common)-  http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31...    Speedo-  http://www.srsport.com/images/products/S...    The pants/legskin (for when you get more advanced and only for meets)  http://swimshops.com/ProdImages/MC_Speed...    The full suit- (once again for when you get advanced)  http://www.steroid.com/blog/wp-content/u...    Hope that helps I highly suggest the jammer for you :)|`|qmjJswzkaa	My hairy son swam on the swim team all through grammar, middle school, high school and college. You see them during competition when they "shave down" to cut the drag. Trust me, there are lots of hairy guys swimming!|`|qjquVj0daa	Speedos are a must on a swim team. The hair part is optional. :) many hairy guys swim, when you are in a completion it is said that being hairy causes drag in the water, so.... you shave, I was on a city team and a high school team, only shaved once for the Nationals. Others shaved more.|`|Hl7OvXruaa	YES! u will have to wear a swim team    and u do have to shave... apparently it will make u swim faster|`|hyLnJibTaa	I guard a high school swim team. All they guys wear speedo 's but the long ones. like this http://www.swimoutlet.com/product_p/986....  And guys that are on the swim team shave and or wax their leg an ex.  But only the hair that is not covered by the swim suit. So you can join the swim team even if you have hair all over your body.|`|TG8wFbMuaa	We're hairless because we shave.  But no you dont have to wear a speedo its just easier. Theres alot of guys that wear some trunk looking thin (forgot what there called). There not trunks but not speedos if your shy you could wear them...whatever theyre called =)|`|dvBS1hkAaa	LOL they are hairless because they shave them so that they can swim faster.
9bf27d9c7d3d63fd350e1063b6507711aa	But everything you mention is all in the past tense.   You can't live on past achievements....  In many leagues around the world, you know there is a very short attention span in terms of a club's current success. Atletico Madrid had very high expectations coming into the season, expectations they have not met till this point. For them the logical choice for change is to get rid of the manager. This is very common and I am absolutely sure you understand that.     Would I have fired him, no way....not under the circumstances but in Business your value to me is what you can do for me now and in the future, your track record is pretty meaningless at this point.     Would you welcome Aguirre back as a possible candidate for the National Team Managerial post?    I am hearing very strong rumours that Sven keeping his job will be very dependent on the result of that WC Qualifier against the USA    @rafa   Not sure how much you follow the Spanish (Spain) press but they always report how surprised they are that Wenger still has his job @ Arsenal and that if he was in Spain, he would have been sacked years ago being that they are a big club in the Footballing world. Could it be a cultural thing? Real Madrid sack managers even if they win them the league....lol  (Del Bosque and Capello)    From what I understand, their were people in upper management pressuring for Aguirre to leave but others who would give him the benefit of the doubt due to the success he has brought to the club. I agree with you that this is not the best move for them at this point in time, but managers are always the first to blame when things go sour.|`|UbvfR4xdaa	I feel disgusted there stupid. he got himself in hard problems and got.   so that is stupid he should have stayed he might have become champion.|`|jLRpCt03aa	Wow. I heard it here 1st. Sad thing but thats La Liga politics for ya. If its the president's head the fans want the board gives them the coach' instead. Stupid thing. But anyway I think the team/players themselves are underperforming, Aguirre should have cracked the whip before it came to this.|`|SvNcWfdJaa	that sucks  well to bad for atletico theyre soon going to find out that it was a mistake|`|V7TfiVjAaa	I doubt anyone here watches any of the games. Everyone that comments will only be repeating what they hear on tv.     If you had watched the last game, the fans were chanting and yelling at the colchonero president as well as Aguirre. It was time for him to go. The bench was not playing hard for him, and a few players were throwing games by getting red carded or causing penalties late in the game.|`|HZ8KkQKWaa	yes and now they will suffer      http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/feeda...|`|cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	you cannot compare Aguirre's accomplishments to what Aragones accomplished, Aguirre didn't win any trophies with Atletico, Aragones won them a league title, 3 Copa del Rey, 1 Intercontinental Cup and 1 Spanish Super Cup.    this question isn't about Aragones yes, but you're overrating Aguirre this way, he's a good guy i admit, i admire his professionalism but the team was inconsistent, he should've removed those with negative influence on the team, Atletico are an inconsistent team.|`|QcEcylBvaa	The problem is that estos baboso ya se creen muy chingones ya. Before Aguirre, they were in danger of going to descend and haven't qualified to the Champions League in a long time. I feel shocked by this, I wanted him to stay 3-4 games max to decide his future.|`|1GpHnVHwaa	I agree with you 100% Atletico is gonna do bad from now on..I hope they lose the Champions and everything so they can see what they let go!|`|Cpm25Pekaa	I know what you mean, but the results need to come.    Arriba Mexico|`|DO7nz8aRaa	yeah he did what all those big coaches couldn't do and got them to a level they hadn't seen in a long time come on just because he didn't win a few games this is outrageous|`|KFPMRPmUaa	Not really.    He's shmex.|`|5fSMFUJIaa	I do find it kind of bad since what he has done for that team,and Hala Madrid!|`|gcniNCn2aa	TENGO MIEDO QUE EL ATLETICO SEA CULERO!!!  TENGO MIEDO QUE LE META MAS GOLES AL AMERICA!!!
zii6IWHoaa	they are probably watching him practice his ARCA car just in cause something like that happens. I serious doubt they wont let him race Daytona.|`|fcdf0737fcea001cde661a3185c02037aa	Nothing will happen to the 20 car because Logano won't fail. :)|`|i6dCEAjoaa	Trust me, he will be in the Daytona 500, I am sure he will pass the test, but also, in today's economy, NASCAR will not want to upset any sponsor, especially one as big as Home Depot.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	The team will probably find a driver with experience, usually one who DNQs.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Never happen.....NASCAR will make sure their new shining star will be in the field of the biggest race of the year. History repeats itself especially NASCAR history. They will find a way to get him in just as they did with getting Tony in the Shootout.    Just an opinion as always.|`|7RUMbREoaa	That's not going to happen.Joey is far too good to not even be approved to race at Daytona.He will be there,I promise ;)|`|vj6YpJn8aa	Sterling Marlin is looking for a ride and could drive the  20 in the plate races, but I too don't think this will be an issue.|`|n55igpCUaa	It will get backup driver'd.
JZ1E66FEaa	at my school they do but you probably can wear leggings under them, but you can talk to your coahc first next year and find out.
2sIwoqRGaa	You can be any age if you are good enough. 17 or 18 will be fine. It's going to be up to your coaches to decide if you are physically and mentally grown up enough to cope with the pressures and you may find 2014 comes too soon at that age.  Remember Owen was 18 at WC 1998.    Good luck to you, but remember that only a few 'exceptional' players manage to get into national teams at that age.|`|0EmjQjf7aa	you can be in your 30's. and still play|`|7DwKjkMWaa	WELL THERE IS NO AGE RESTRICTIONS BUT THE YOUNGEST PLAYER WAS I THINK 16. SO SINCE YOU'LL BE 18 YOUR OK.  WELL GOOD LUCK, PRACTICE REALLY HARD.|`|YmV3TNTpaa	There's no age restriction to play in the World Cup because you don't necessarily have to be professional to be selected in your national team.    Good luck for your dream
iAuQGNKnaa	United vs Barcelona  both are the leaders in their leagues, and they're real good with quality players, and it will also be a messi vs ronaldo game, and well see which one is better.|`|SjNjtmCjaa	Man U//AC Milan|`|UztfjBOFaa	A.C. Milan Vs. Manchester United|`|5x4MlPlHaa	milan-barca|`|o1VrCIAuaa	i agree with SMILEY over there :)|`|9rvaMQ0eaa	milan-manu|`|gbFwoOtTaa	milan v barca|`|RmZ54Shvaa	A.C MILAN VS MANCHESTER UNITED|`|3nl5JtpKaa	AC Milan vs Barcelona  Both teams are highly attacking-minded with less focus on defence, so many goals are predicted along with non-stop end-to-end action. Many fast and technicaly gifted players are more than able to guarantee a breath-taking performance. Plus a ball-down, pacey and with quick passing game is something Man Utd can't offer...
IMu3wBu8aa	Shannon Moore. He is a great wrestler. I think they should bring back the Cruiserweight Division and have him be a huge part of it.     Stevie Richards (ugh still mad about that)- Would have made ECW, well...ECW! Him and Tommy could have been a big part of a new and improved ECW. Ya know, something closer to the original.     Al Snow- he was freakin awesome. He could make things more interesting on every show. Maybe, Him, Stevie, and Tommy can make Ecw a lot better. I know they can, I wish they were given the chance.    BQ: It's very important. It has to be made so that a wrestler CAN wrestle in it. It also adds to their character. Example: If a Diva wore a decent wrestling outfit, they would be able to wrestle a bit better.|`|smcDn76jaa	1. Elijah Burke. This guy had the talent and the promo skills to go to the top. It's ridiculous that they had no creative plans for him. He could have been a future main event er and have some good feuds.    2. Hade Vansen. I know some people might not know him or care, but when I heard he was going to debut I did some research. This guy is amazingly talented and seems to have some promo skills. The gimmik he was going to start with was probably going to great, but they stopped for no reason.    3. Matt Morgan. Who's bright idea it was to release this guy. The man is huge and yet he moves like he's a cruiserweight. From what I have seen himdo in TNA it's onvious he could have made a huge impact on the WWE today.    BQ- Not that important but it does have an affect on merchandise. No one would want to buy a wrestler's merchandise if they had a terrible outfit.|`|Og4Ab2dSaa	what?|`|yGpvN7Noaa	what|`|DfPyyDssaa	The Powers of Pain=This tag team would be a dominate force in today's WWE.    King Kong Bundy=Another dominating force.Would have had a great feud with Big Show or possibly have been a powerful tag team.    Ultimo Dragon=He would have been the the greatest cruiserweight ever,but WWE didn't know how to use him.      BQ:VERY important.Not only does clothes make the man,it also makes the wrestler.|`|d2lcJcJtaa	My 3 picks are raven, Elijah Burke, and the last one Christopher Daniels. Look at the impact Daniels and Raven made on TNA and just think if The WWE would have kept them what they could have done for the WWE. Elijah had so much talent to just be a mid card jobber and Used for nothing My runner ups areRikishi i heard was released for Not losing weight. He could have done good things with Umaga>  Frankie Kazarin He was release for refusing for cutting his hair he was a Great wrestler who could have done great things for the WWE And Matt Morgamn This man is a beast plain and simble     1.Raven  2. Christopher Daniels  3. Elijah Burke  Runner-Up  Kaz  Matt Morgan  Rikishi      BQ: The Wrestlers Clothing is Medium Important I mean most is used for gimmicks to help pass them with the fans. But it also shows the person in real life if the design there ring attire|`|4V6V9uN8aa	1. The Road Warriors - If Hawk were still with us, I think they would have revolutionized what a truly dominant tag team is supposed to be.. Their popularity & style puts their merchandise through the roof, just as it did back then & still sells today.    2. Paul Heyman - True, not a wrestler, but his vision & knowledge of the sport is second to none.  For the naysayers, think on this..  If Heyman had gotten the right kind of tv deal for ECW during it's early years, how far would they have grown on WWE?  WWE was having problems with WCW during the NWO years & had to resort to raiding ECW to maintain the balance.  This was only because of the tv deal that ECW had with Turner Broadcasting that went down the tubes.  Change that fact & you change wrestling history.    3. Brock Lesnar - Lesnar is dominating & a main attraction wherever he goes, first in WWE, now in UFC.  He is huge, has the looks, he's a monster in every way he should be.  Coming back to WWE would be massive for all involved.  Some of the best matches in WWE history all involved Brock.  The IronMan Match with Kurt Angle, the Superplex of the Big Show that destroyed a ring, his first title win over the Rock inside of 9 months with the company, the Hell In A Cell against the Undertaker...  Now, in only his fifth fight in UFC, he is the Heavyweight Champion, taking the title from one of their legends inside of 2 rounds.  He is the world of sports entertainments, "Next Big Thing"..    I'm just saying..|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I think they made a mistake releasing Estrada. He was a great entertaining manager in a world where managers are missing today|`|savPsYWjaa	Bastion Booger  Adam Bomb  Repo Man|`|GqZDHf6eaa	I HAVE to pick four, sorry =(  SCSA  The Rock  Hulk Hogan  Andre the Giant    Because everybody knows them, and all would love to watch them in action again.

VghVdPfsaa	OFFENSE    QB - Peyton Manning - I'm def. not his biggest fan, but I've got to admit that he has a keen ability to perform in the crunch. He doesn't make many mistakes and is a great football player.  RB - Adrian Peterson - His explosiveness and ability is enough for him to beat almost any defense. (LT is a close second, but couldn't perform as well this year due to the injuries)  FB - Lorenzo Neal - Many of LT's most successful seasons was thanks mainly to this guy.  WR - Randy Moss and Larry Fitzgerald - Both have the raw talent of a WR. Both create opportunities not only for themselves, but for others.  TE - Tony Gonzalez - At this point in time, Tony is the best. He is a possession receiver and has a knack for making the best catch. Although Antonio Gates is better only when healthy, because of his great hands and explosiveness.   LT - Joe Thomas - Still young, but shows the raw talent to be successful for years to come.  LG - Steve Hutchinson - Another great run blocker. With Bryant McKinnie, they pave the way for AP.  C - Jeff Saturday - No explanation needed.   RG - Chris Snee - A great run and pass blocker.  RT - Mark Tauscher - A good, underrated player for the Pack.     DEFENSE    (Instead of the best LE and RE, I picked the best two DEs)  DE - Jared Allen - Speedy and relentless, he not only has a nose for the QB, but for the ball as well.   DE - Dwight Freeny  - Although he's small for a defensive end, his speed around the edge makes it difficult for even the most athletic tackle to block.   DT - Jamal Williams - Although he isn't the most well-known, I've witnessed his power first-hand throughout the years as a dedicated Chargers fan. He holds the middle and knows how to get to the ball carrier.  OLB - James Harrison - You all know why. Need proof, look no further than last night (although I wasn't too fond of punching that guy while the guy was down, but still a tenacious player and a great story).  MLB - Ray Lewis - I love his tenacity. He brings so much to the whole Ravens team and is both a vocal and showing the way leader. (Patrick Willis will be  1 in a year or two).   OLB - Shawne Merriman - Can get to the QB like no other linebacker can.   CB - Champ Bailey - Proven veteran who doesn't avoid the contact. Just look at how few times quarterbacks will challenge him.   FS - Ed Reed - Incredible nose for the ball when it's in the air. His pick 6 ability makes him a threat every time the ball is passed.  SS - Troy Polamalu - One of my favorite players, and he plays the game the right way. His relentless and football smarts make him good in any defensive situation.   K - Rob Bironas and Adam Vinateri - Both are clutch kickers who get it done when it's needed most.  P - Mike Scrifes - I might be biased on this (and I don't really pay attention to the punters all the time), but he can control the ball and pinpoint it on a dime. (OK maybe not, but it sounded good...)    HONORABLE MENTIONS:    Nnamdi Asomugha, Julius Peppers, Tom Brady, Brian Urlacher, Mario Williams, DeMarcus Ware, Albert Haynesworth and Alan Faneca.|`|S71lfad2aa	QB brady  RB peterson  FB mcclain  WR adre Johnson not fitz  TE witten  T thomas  Gandrews  C birck  def end williams mario  DT haynsworh  OLB marriman  MLB willis  CB asomugha  FS reed  SS palomalo  K stover  P lechler|`|P2rBox0Iaa	IT  IS  FAKE    Thumb  me   down,  you   all  are  brainwashed|`|BGOPARrTaa	troy polamalu, and the steelers|`|gHtI5xe7aa	QB:P.

AA11694178	No, they are not the same at all.  They are as different as night and day.  Black powder is made of charcoal, sulfur and Potassium Nitrate.  It is not a progressive burning powder.  That means that the burning rate does not increase with an increase in pressure.  The result is a quicker rise to maximum pressure but that maximum pressure is considerably lower than that achieved by smokeless powders.    Smokeless powders are made of such substances as nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine and mixtures of these and other components.  Smokeless powder is a progressive burning powder as I explained above.  The rate at which the powder burns and the maximum pressure reached is determined by the mixture that goes into each different blend.  There are fast burning powders such as Red Dot, Green Dot, etc. that are made for use in pistol cartridges and shotgun cartridges.  For rifle cartridges, there are slower burning powders such as IMR 4831 or XMR 3100.    Because of these differences, you MUST make sure of using the correct powder in the correct amount when reloading ammo.  These correct charges are published in reloading manuals which are available from any store that sells reloading equipment.  Do not attempt to reload ammo without one of these manuals in your posession.  Read, understand and follow the powder and load recommendations published in the manual.  Taking someone else's word for it can get you injured or killed.  Do it right or don't do it at all.    NEVER, NEVER use a smokeless powder in a muzzleloader unless it is specified as a black powder substitute such as Triple 7, Shockey's Gold or Pyrodex.  If you were to use smokeless powder in a muzzleloader, you will, in effect, have created a pipe bomb that you will be holding up near your head when you set it off.  You will be extremely lucky if you survive and if you do survive, you will be highly unlikely to ever be normal again.  Just a word of warning.|`|xOReEw6Waa	Black powder is exactly what it says black powder from Carbon Black,Sulfur and Potassium Nitrate. Gun powders (Smokeless Modern Types) are made with Nitro-cellulose and other mixes to provide the modern offerings more speed and better loading options. Many people still use black powder in muzzle loaders and some use black powder to load for old cartridges like the 45-70 Trap Door and similar weapons.   Modern powders come in a wide range of burn speeds and vary with the type of weapons. Rifles, Shotguns and pistols don't use the same powders normally (there is some overlaps) and certain powders match up to certain style cartridges and bullet weights.|`|lAWi4Mv0aa	no their isn't a difference. black powder is another name for gun powder|`|AA10232540	Black powder is a type of gunpowder.....so is white powder, Cordite, Ballistite, other smokeless powders etc etc etc.  There is no definitive "gunpowder" anymore....it's a word that means "any powder used to propel a bullet from a gun", so it's a yes and a no.  Blackpowder is *A* gunpowder, but not the *ONLY* gunpowder.

jHJ0W9QNaa	i agree! Gasol is the REAL leader of the Lakers. Kobe Bryant is nothing but a choke artist and pathetic loser. he is nothing without Shaquille O'Neal, Pau Gasol, and Andrew Bynum. nothing.    EDIT: MC, do you really think i am Cindy Laker Fan?|`|0E8SPyyXaa	Yes Gasol Needs to stay healthy then they have no other options besides DJ MEBENGA or Chris Mihm which arent great options|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	crap you are right well he well have a tough time carring the team|`|KYaM65gzaa	as leader of a team, gasol is 0-12 in playoff games.|`|o6KAdVUSaa	GASOL SUCKS|`|1f60cd236744da3f80d9d6fa54fe4bfcaa	no sweety, btw i really don't believe your a girl cuz a girl would not have a pic of boobs, so dude what we need is toughness, what we need is SHAQ|`|ba7cca95147ca64ee9b79a5ddb025566aa	your partially correct.  gasol does play very well and is one of the team leaders.    but notice thats because kobe is the one who sets up the plays and gets the assists from gasol when he gives him the ball to shoot.    kobe is the reason why the gasol looks so good, you need to realize that.  have you ever seen gasol setting up the plays??  points arent the only thing that matter in basketball.|`|oWcEywJ7aa	well figure this....last year they have basically the same team...this year there not missing anything they had last year...but they have better farmar sasha ariza...lot better team....plus it doesnt affect them as much becuase instead of starting lamar odom at sf he plays pf anyways, so gasol back to center odom pf and there just like last year then bynum makes it for the playoffs....lakers are good...just may suffer a few extra losses in the season...|`|2zk5K9Njaa	They need Bynum's presence in the middle.  Mainly on the defensive end.  It may be hard for them to keep the western conference lead with the Spurs and Nuggets playing well.  After all, the Lakers did say they lost to Boston in the finals because of Bynum's injury.|`|uxregJ0faa	You gonna choke on my 24 inch.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Everyone have to stay healthy at this point.     EDIT: Can I get a response on what has K.G/Allen/Pierce done individually, Cindy?
iw3v5bgIaa	Do you mean "how much does it cost to be on a ice hockey team"?    First of all, can you skate forward, backward and sideways without a stick? Get the basics down before complicating (and possibly frustrating you) your game with stickhandling, passing and shooting.    If you are just starting out get good fitting skates and a helmet first (with good ankle support) and then gloves, elbow pads, shin guards, etc.     To join a team, you will probably have to try out before being accepted, so get your skills and conditioning up. Sadly, some teams will accept your money to participate rather than on talent, and you might pay for sitting on the bench.    Get as much ice time as you can and the best equipment that you can afford.

dDhTMacAaa	I think their best chance is against Cleveland.    Sorry ,but New York loves to run and loves to get other teams to run. LeBron's biggest weakness is in his own arsenal of tools, and that is settling to the "please take it King James" three pointer.    If the Knicks get the Cavs to start running all night, D'Antoni could get his team a W and a biiiiiiiig, wiiiiiiiide grin as he dials Steve Nash's phone number on his cell phone. ;) (had to add that...Nash (and other Suns) miss him a lot.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	I think it will be the Lakers|`|7t7XzXsVaa	the lakers|`|khbLZQHIaa	CoughCelticsCough.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	i think the Knicks will upset the Lakers. i'm sensing a major collapse and loss of focus for the Lakers after the Bynum injury, especially Kobe Bryant.

Got no idea, sounds like a big person, Chris Gayle?|`|kecdkv6jaa	1) if he just holds his hand on his shoulder it is signalling "1 short".. if he taps his shoulder then points his finger towards the square leg umpire, batsmen etc. he would be signalling one dangerous ball, if too many are bowled (2 or 3 i think) the bowler will be taken off.    2) ummm Graeme Smith?    3) another guess Shane Warne?|`|b9C8CKo1aa	1.I think there is no such signal....its cancelling the call if hands put on opposite shoulders..    2.Ponting..????    3.Sangakkara...??|`|gz2M5hsBaa	1. Isn't that used to signal a short run (when a batsman tries to run 2 or more runs and fails to make his ground and puts his bat in short at one of the turns).     2. I'll guess that it's Rahul Dravid.    3. I have no idea. I'll say Stephen Harmison. Being the useless bowler he is, he might have done something like that to actually take a wicket.|`|AA11088802	1.What would the Umpire be signalling, if he put his right hand on his right shoulder (or his left-hand on his left shoulder)?    signalling shoulder height ball    2.Which batsmen spent 26,682 minutes batting in his career in Test Cricket?    sachin or border or could be dravid    3.Which current Test Cricketer was once involved in a catch, in which he tackled the batsmen to the ground and then caught the ball?    its a difficult one  EDIT: WILD GUESS: A B Devillier  w8ing 4 perfect answer|`|JC9wAaOsaa	1. Warning for the bowler to keep the next deliveries below the shoulder, you get one per over and that was it     2. 7 1/2 days of batting, 180hrs (ish) so approx 120 matches give or take... Im saying Ricky Ponting     3. ah god Ill need some more time on this lol
Leoc8rlGaa	In 1995, Australia played 12 Tests, winning 7, losing 3, and drawing 2:  http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engi...  http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engi...    The first of those 12 Tests were the last 3 in the Ashes series of 1994/5. Australia were already 2 up in that series. Although losing one of the Tests, they won that series 3-1. England were a poor side on that tour, hindered by an unathletic fielding unit and muddled selection policies, as well as the usual spate of injuries they generally pick up on an Ashes tour.    The next four matches Australia played in 1995 were in the Caribbean, where they finally dethroned the mighty West Indies, and Glenn McGrath rose to prominence, leading the attack in the absence of Craig McDermott. The bowling attack was a well balanced unit, and the batting was exceptionally strong.      The remaining Tests were at home, against a weak Pakistani side, whom Shane Warne took apart, and a mediocre (especially in terms of bowling) Sri Lankan team, that one Australian cricketer ridiculed as being a team to score a hundred or take five wickets against.    So overall, the 1995 side was a strong one, but other than the West Indies, no one seriously tested them.    In 1999 and 2000, Australia played 22 Tests, winning 17, drawing 2, and losing 3:  http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engi...  http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engi...  That included 14 wins in a row, which continued into 2001, before India famously ended their record with Dravid and Laxman's heroic fightback at Kolkata.    This particular Australian side was already established as the best in the world. But they struggled in the Caribbean at the start of 1999, with Warne eventually being dropped due to his poor form, following his return from injury. They also lost a series in Sri Lanka, where generally their batsmen struggled, especially Mark Waugh.    They picked up against Zimbabwe however, and steamrolled Pakistan and India back in the Southern continent, with Adam Gilchrist making a remarkable, match-winning century in just his second Test. New Zealand were also swept aside, and the West Indies got some of the treatment they had been meting out for years, when Australia humiliated them 5-0.    So overall, the 1999-2000 side was a good one at home, with an especially strong bowling attack, but the batting could be a little hit-and-miss at times away from home.    The 2006 side won 10 out of 10:  http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engi...  http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engi...    This included thrashing South Africa in South Africa, and a home drubbing of England. Strangely though, this was an Australian side that was winning, but at times appeared to be living off past glories, many players knew they were coming to the end, and were having one final swansong. Although they dominated, and won their matches, there was a feeling that things weren't quite as they were.    Overall, it is hard to pick a "best" side. The 1999-2000 side became all conquering, but the series defeat in SriLanka, and the drawn one in the West Indies, suggested that if conditions or circumstances weren't favourable, then they could be beatable. The 2006 one was already starting to tentatively look to the future, and the side was generally an experienced one that could call on match know-how to pull off victories. The 1995 side had a fresh new bowling attack, and a batting line-up in its prime, with only David Boon heading for his sell-by date.     So I will plump for the 1995 side, as the series victory in the Caribbean was a tremendous achievement, that on it's own ranks higher than any of the other glories attained by the other two sides.    But this is all subjective, and open to everyone's interpretation.|`|JC9wAaOsaa	Without going to the extent of copying info from a cricket site, 2006 to me was the dominate force.|`|wNxh1OU3aa	2006|`|GGuXJJeAaa	99/00 a complete set of excellent cricketers|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	G,McGrath S.Warne duo is the common factor in the teams.  1999-2000 team was the starting block of a team that went on to create records.

Andrwe Symonds- one of the best fielders in cricket history. An amazing all-rounder who performs when his country needs him the most    Adam Gilchrist- THE best Batsman/Wicketkeeper I've ever known    Shane Warne- THE best Legbreak bowler    Brett Lee- THE bowler with the best combination of speed, accuracy and consistence.     Glen McGrath- one of the best swing bowler I've known    Stuart Clark- Amazing accuracy, and consistent speeds.

I think thhat is when Warnie and McGrath were in their prime and Slater and Langer were always lethal with the bat,as was Mark Waugh.|`|LzkujA3Faa	Haven't really seen the guys in the 95 squad playing. So i can compare only between 99 and '06. And i think i would go with the 2006 squad. even though many of the players in that squad has retired and is curently not playing up to their potential, they were an intimidating team, when they were in form. No other team, except perhaps the West Indies of the 1970's, had dominated the cricket so much.|`|AA11088802	for me.. 99/00|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I would have to go with the 2006 team.|`|0QBKiP2naa	Steve Waughs side is the best under his captaincy we played positive attacking cricket Taylor was also a great captain but Ponting doesnt even come close as a captain he is PATHETIC|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	2006|`|130aad9e2b5a3b99346ce0725f94e57caa	I feel that 2006 side had a perfect blend of youth and experience and a balance of allrounders, batsmen and record wicket takers in international cricket.

QC2NozBkaa	An arrow out of a modern compound (or strong recurve/longbow for that matter) will zip in one side and out the other of a deer sized animal unless it strikes a major bone.

MwDRb7GLaa	In the price range you listed you should only consider a front suspension mountain bike. Full suspension that's worthwhile costs at least $1000.  The single most important criteria you should look at is fit. Most bikes in bike stores are very competitive. There is really very little difference in standard equipment at a given price point. But the frames are significantly different which allows them to fit different people. Try several brands and you will find one that is obviously better than the rest for you. It will ride better and feel better. If it doesn't just stick out, keep looking.  I would look for a fork from Rock Shox, Marzocchi, Manitou, or Fox. These brands have stuck around for many years and for good reason.  I always suggest V brakes or hydraulic disc brakes. Stay away from mechanical disc as they are no more effective than V brakes, weigh more, and cost more.|`|Fx5BENIxaa	what do you mean by travel. do you mean how long you can use it before it falls apart. if so my friend rode across United states and back again which averages out to around 7000 miles and hes still riding on his bike with out any problems.|`|7l4tR0aZaa	it all depends on the type of bike u plan on getting, a downhill/gravity/freeride bike will have 7-10 inches of travel, an all mountain bike will have 5-7 inches of travel and a cross-country bike will have 3- 5 inches of travel. most people will buy a trail or x-c bike. all of those types are full suspension except that some x-c ones are hardtails. the geomerty is very important. it it has a bad geometry that means its a bad fit,if it had a good geometry it has a good fit. the geomerty is the fit and the angles of cetain tubes in a bike,not the look. in that price range ur only going to find cheap hardtails, if  u buy used u may find a decent full suspension or awsome hardtail. in ur price range i would buy used. u can email me at csi13@sbcglobal.net with the state and county u live in or a major city u live near by that u wouldnt mind driving to to buy a bike. it u send me thatg i can look for some nice bikes on craigslist and email them 2 u, i did this with another and she got a real good bike          hope i helped, good luck with whatever u do
ARzy5MDLaa	I love specialized but for this price there isn't a big difference. I would go with the trek. I have had the promax brakes. They are not hydrolics but they aren't bad. The trek has 24 speeds. the specialized has 21. This is good for road riding to have 24 speeds. I would highly reccomend going for $100 more you would be much much happier with the bike. Then I would reccomend the specialized hardrock sport disc for more road riding less dirt, and the trek 4300 disc for more dirt less pavement. WAY better components for $100 more they are going to last a lot longer and work A LOT better. good luck!|`|JSGLKnA4aa	specialized!! i own two.|`|de7215341349f0d0bbb073031301015caa	I don't know about Specialiazed but Trek offers LIFETIME warranty for the frame.

53986a54fb7e28986e6d815651923852aa	I think production wise, WWE needs to go back to being an adrenaline filled, blood pumping, roller coaster grabs it's viewers and intrests them in more "in-your-face" programming. I said absolutely nothing about the Attitude Era. There's a difference in my opinion. It's all in the way you present your product. Even if people don't like the product (and some still don't) they'll still consider it a daily ritual to tune in.      I think WWE should limit the number of storyline based fueds so they can focus on developing the ones that always end up getting cut short. I think some more HBK/Jericho and Matt Hardy/MVP style fueds should be created so that fans can get accustomed to wrestlers and how they interact. That way you're killing two birds with one stone. Your getting guys over with the fans (if it works) and you're getting people more familiar with the characters. Instead of having many fueds they could have fewer with more people added. Something similar to having the Y2J/Batista/HBK program right after Wrestlemania 24.     This is going to sound corny, but I think WWE should do better on lighting and entrance themes. Everyone likes a good blackout or a really catchy theme. Entrances in general tend to be a bit generic. Again, small issue but notice how all of the most distinct entrances get the biggest pops.     I think JR and King and Tazz and Michael Cold should reunite on RAW and Smackdown respectively.    I think WWE should hold more 80's style title matches, especially for mid card titles. Start out, wait until everybody has made it to the ring, check the wrestlers, do the intros, and let em fight. Scratch that. What I meant to say is they should give title matches a respectful "Puro feel" to them. Run ins are ok if they are reduced a bit. But run ins are better when they are used to enhance a fued.     I don't think WWE should limit the movesets of guys in an attempt to "brand" certain popular moves. Repetition is going to happen. And also, gimmicks shouldn't always determine how a guy wrestles. If he wrestlers better than a clown, or a guys in a chicken suit, or a mentally challenged individual, then let him/her do what they do best.    This one is super small. WWE abuses the special affects button in their promos. I prefer this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rda-voDpL... over this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETatbd1e_...  any day.    I think WWE needs to stop creating tag teams out of guys who basically don't know each other well in the ring. This kind of thing would bump up the tag team division. Since there aren't territiories anymore, guys aren't able to develop repuations off of previous in-ring. Tag teams would be better if they were hired as tag teams. And if they don't work out, they should be fired as tag teams.    When guys come into the WWE from other places or with past prestigous accomplishments and accolades, then WWE should acknowledge that. They did a pretty good job hyping the background of Vladimir Kozlov but some guys don't get that kind of exposure. This has always been my motto. WWE superstars are only as good as WWE makes them out to be. Fans fall for that. Matt Striker is really good at doing his homework. But people (kids also for those WWE PG rating haters) are going to notice a guy whose wrestled all over the world and won mutliple titles if WWE says they did (even if they didn't lol)|`|AA11482019	They need better storylines and more compelling matches.   And since you mentioned it, yeah fire Cena.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	They need to push more younger talent on Smackdown. I know they are doing that on ECW and on RAW with people like Swagger and Kofi Kingston but that really can't be said with Smackdown. Smackdown starts a push but cancels it midway such as with Brian Kendrick, Shelton Benjamin, and R-Truth.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	They need to bring back the old King of the Ring. Not this nonsense they have now. It's not the same at all. I think it deserves it's own PPV again. If they aren't going to do it the proper way, don't do it at all. BUT I want them to do it still, so they should just do it properly. King of the Ring is a nice thing to add to someones career.     Give the Diva's better story lines and more opportunities.    Bring back the Cruiserweight Division.|`|29HdM4n8aa	I wanna see more muscular but sexy women fight one another and women like Chyna to fight the men.|`|dGYR81enaa	They should make it much more difficult for the championships to be won because they seem to be changing hands quite regularly now eg from November to January the wwe championship went from Triple H to Edge to Jeff back to Edge. They shouldn't fire Cea because he's a great entertainer but maybe turn him heel and reduce his push a bit. Undertaker should also be world champ!|`|3I6YUfg0aa	Get rid of the 'PG ERA'|`|f3AdydqAaa	They need to make better storylines, get wrestlers back. Get rid of ECW. Buy TNA, make a better WWE.|`|AA10315175	I think the wwe should go back to how it use to be when the rock and stone cold were there. They had better story lines and better characters.I understand that times has change but you can change with time too. I feel like they have corny character now. They need to use the wrestler to the best of their abilities. like the bigger guys. If you are 6 feet 7inch tall I think they should have more power and make more people scare of them. When do little skinny guys win so much. Just looking at that  makes it too fake for  one to get into watching wrestling.|`|Xar3YgiRaa	What bothers me most anbout the new and Current WWE era is the lack of exciting cruiserweight wrestling. I miss the matches from the old WCw cruiserweight division. They were soo exciting and i actually could sit through them with out fast forwarding through the match. Now in the WWE most of the matches are the same old thing with nothing exciting. Vince McMahon destroyed all of Americas cruiserweight action. EVAN BOURNE and REY MYSTERIO are my favourite wrestlers in the WWE because of the excitment during the matches because you know something great is going to happen. Why can't Vince bring back this division and put it on a sinking show like ECW. I am willing to bet that if anything the ratings would go way up with the action and guys like Low Ki, Brian Kendrick and Evan Bourne being on this show. it would make something in the WWE different, for people who like another style of wrestling. this bothers me incredibly, Even TNA has stopped using the X division as much. I miss highflying action and i want it back.    That is what bothers me about the current WWE and todays wrestling in general!!|`|2rJwgk40aa	One thing that really bothers me is the womens division.wwe has alot of women who can wrestle really well,and they need to stop jobbing them to women who cant fight.  They also need to drop the Divas title.Its nothing more then a accessory,no one with any decent ability has won it.  Also,knock it off with the playboy stuff.if they wanna do it,fine.But dont give them a spot at Wrestlemania just because they did it.
gdW8rZt8aa	No, what he does in his personal time/ life is his own business.  It is not like he is running the government or something that will effect us.|`|C6d4ndMOaa	I don't care, he's human like everybody else.|`|PVe6jK78aa	He is god they should put his face on Rushmore after that lol. What he does in his spare time doesn't effect me at all. He could go around killing hookers for all i care he's still a damn good swimmer.|`|M5XjqI40aa	I like him more now. He took a bong hit, so what.|`|OGEC7RFwaa	i don't really care. let him do what he wants to do.  it is kinda disappointing though, cause hes like a role model and what not.. maybe all the fame got to him and hes stressed?|`|3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	I'm going to go against the crowd here and say YES. He could have gone into hiding after the Olympics, but he chose to stay in the media spotlight. He was a role model that kids and adults of all ages could look up to. He had endorsement deals lined up around the block. I'm guessing those days are over. No company wants to be affiliated with a drug user, even a casual one.    Just think of Pepsi's new slogan: Phelps, the greatest athlete in the world, that does the occasional bong hit on the side.    YES, he's an adult.  YES, he did it in private.    BUT, he is now a celebrity and has to be careful of how his image is portrayed in the media. And as of now, it's very poor.|`|AA11879718	No, I am not disappointed in him. Sure, he smoked weed.. but in the privacy of his own home, and he was not hurting anyone else. It also has not interfered in his life in major ways.    Had he been caught doing cocaine, heroin, or meth.. then yes, I would be very upset with him, because those drugs are very addicting and can ruin lives en masse.    To the contrary, though some people do indeed have substance abuse with cannabis, this is rare. Most people do not form an addiction, and most don't do it regularly. They just do it for fun here and there. A lot like drinking.. Sure, it can get out of hand, but if you monitor yourself and all, it can be ok on occasion.    What he does in the privacy of his own home is not any of my business, so I am not worried.|`|ZX0ackIraa	i don't care, its his choice. People smoke weed all the time, and then when a celebrity does it people make it a big deal.|`|8bTder08aa	I am incredulous at his stupidity.    I am also incredulous at the stupidity of the people who are saying "hey, he's only a kid, give him a break."    To deal with the second case:  at age 23, Michael Phelps is not a kid.  He's an adult for all legal purposes.  In terms of life experiences, he's done things and had experiences that a lot of people twice his age haven't done.  He certainly had to know that what he was doing was both stupid and illegal, and...    ...to get to the second point, if he had an IQ higher than a houseplant, he HAD to know that someone was going to take his picture sucking on that bong full o' weed.  Any reasonably intelligent 10-year-old knows that virtually all cell phones can function as cameras, and that virtually anyone over the age of 12 probably has one.  Anyone in Phelps' position has to know that to the tabloid press, a photo of him sucking on a bong full o' weed is worth at least six figures.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that there are a lot of people, even supposed friends, who will find that kind of temptation irresistible.      Phelps signed up for an estimated $100 million worth of endorsements.  Every contract he signed had a "morals clause" that allows the sponsors to break the contract or impose penalties on him that reduced the value of the endorsement.  All he had to do to cash in was first, do some commercials, "meet 'n' greets," and second, stay out of trouble.  For $100 million, there are a hell of a lot of people on this earth who would enter a convent or monastery for the duration of the contract.      I'm not so much disappointed in Phelps as in wonderment at his sheer idiocy.  The guy must have water on the brain to believe he wouldn't get in trouble over what he was doing with that bong and the weed in it.|`|2pxGPcxaaa	His lung capacity is so great, it would be a shame not to smoke weed.|`|rZV2cUhdaa	no. its his life he can do whatever he wants to. we dont personally know him so why should we care?

Wu0XyNspaa	It means that even though you can train your body to win games, you need heart to actually 'play'.    A good example is a player of mine in club volleyball now.  She has decent volleyball skills.  She can pass, dig, set and hit.  Although, it seems like she doesn't give a **** about actually playing volleyball.  Her heart isn't in it.  For that reason, she's always standing up instead of ready position, she laughs off any mistake, and she never tries to pass balls that are more than 1/2 a step away from her.  This is an example of having the skills to play, yet not caring.  She needs some heart to play.|`|tbpNk6rBaa	If you want to win the game, you have to train your body to be strong, but if you want to play, you have to have it trained deep in your heart.|`|iNzRRI70aa	if you want to win then exercise and show that your body can handle It , and  that you can take the heat.

I cannot show you how to go for a ball when you know that you are going to get a little banged up in the process.    I can show you the proper footwork involved in setting but I cannot give you the will to get to every ball in the gym.    With 'heart' you either have it or you do not.  People without heart can still play the game and most of them will do just fine, but who wants to do 'just fine' when greatness is just a heartbeat away?|`|6205283364bce5bf761e31dbab2a3426aa	To win a game of volleyball train your body but to play train your heart        to me it means anyone can train their body to play && win volleyball but if your really love it your heart will show it|`|2MVQeCqOaa	This quote is bad. I'm not trying to be mean or anything, but think about it...     The central purpose of the quote is to explain that playing with heart is better than simply playing mechanically (having trained your body and not your heart).    But the quote fails at it's central purpose when it doesn't tell you how playing with heart is any different.     Playing with heart lets you "play", rather than just "win"...  See how weak this sounds?    If things are as this quote says, than I would rather win. ha (and play)    Sorry, but all this is to say the quote needs to be tweaked, not just summarized. That's why people are having trouble doing a good job.    Now finally, here is my take on it:     To play, train your body. To compete, train your heart.    I think this because the ability to play is physical, but the spirit of play/competition comes from the heart.|`|b0LmNT2qaa	in order to win you need to be fit to play. if you want to play you need to love the game. your heart needs to be into it others wise this game is not for you|`|VIqVwBVMaa	If you want to when you need to be in shape.

Just because you have the ability doesn't always mean that it is the best for you.  The most important though is that you can train your body and have the skills, but you have to have the passion and want to play.|`|zvq3uiB6aa	I think it basically says that yes training your body with physical things is important, and winning is good, but to be truely good at volleyball, you have to love the game and play because you love it.|`|7TMZhYlQaa	winning I think doesnt need to have anything behind it besides skill so to win you have to improve your skills (training your body) but playing is having fun so you need to train your heart to have the kind of time that you want to have|`|8juUgSK2aa	Hey, you want to hear something funny?

So they train, their bodies, to make them achieve the winning status they want.     If your going out to play, and give it all you got, no matter what happens....your playing with your heart. Your playing with love. Love for the game, yourself, your team, etc.|`|68fmDJqIaa	You need to take care of your body and stay in good shape to have skill to win; but if you actually want to play the game instead of just win it, you need to put your heart and feelings into so your a part of it.

AA10281572	There are a few ways to do this that I've done or seen first hand:    1: straight punch to the nose  2: uppercut to the jaw  3: hook to the temple  4: chop from overhead in a mostly downward but somewhat diagonal motion right onto the base of the clavicle (not far from where it meets the neck)... works wonders on drunks, not legal in most competitions so save it for self defense.    You can learn to do most of those with elbows too, which allows these attacks to occur at very close range as well.    If it's a self defense situation, I would recommend learning a couple of nasty kicks that can help a lot:    1: snap kick to the groin (hit it with your shin though, not the ball of your foot)  2: kick their shin with the inside of your foot then rake down and stomp their foot  3: grab the hair or back of the head and yank it down so that your knee meets their face (point your toe down or you could risk serious knee injury)    Remember it's always best to talk your way out of situations if at all possible as their are many social and legal ramifications to fights.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	Jaw, temple, chin.

These are your best targets for a full-on punch from the hip.  Why?  Because you want to cause trauma (violent movement) inside the skull.  The brain is surrounded by fluid which acts as a shock absorber between the brain and the skull.  If you can hit the above mentioned targets with enough force, it will cause the brain to crash into the walls of the skull, causing a concussion.  Done hard enough, lights out.    Next lesson, how to avoid being knocked out...!|`|14a542270477c6ec665696b6980a2370aa	Brian F's got a real good answer, generally around the jawline is a good start, but it's not where you hit, but the amount of force you strike with. it mostly has to do with the recoil of the head from the strike. other times it takes several strikes to wear the opponent down.    different people have different tolerances to head strikes, some may be easily affected while others may take several shots to knock them out|`|ZZTL813aaa	There is a spot called "the button" as some call it, right around the chin. I would say if you want to knock someone out in one punch to definitely aim for this spot. Either a strong cross or an uppercut to the chin should do it, you don't have to be too accurate but if you want to try, look for *ren 24* in this diagram http://www.acumedico.com/stomach.htm and aim for that. I have to say, this spot has worked for me numerous times and I can't promise results but I can say that it does work from time to time.|`|K1BvP2OIaa	Well if you can do it hit them in the temple, if not go for the throat (extend your fingers on that one) and don't hit them to hard in the throat or you'll kill them.  Just hard enough to get them to collapse chocking.  It'll be the most effective but also the most dangerous.
SPleGlS1aa	From ATF website:  Does the GCA prohibit anyone from making a handgun, shotgun or rifle?    With certain exceptions a firearm may be made by a non-licensee provided it is not for sale and the maker is not prohibited from possessing firearms. However, a person is prohibited from assembling a non-sporting semi-automatic rifle or non-sporting shotgun from imported parts. In addition, the making of an NFA firearm requires a tax payment and approval by ATF. An application to make a machine gun will not be approved unless documentation is submitted showing that the firearm is being made for a Federal or State agency.    [18 U.S.C. 922(o) and (r), 26 U.S.C. 5822, 27 CFR 478.39, 479.62 and 479.105]|`|DAtIypvzaa	even if you know what you're doing you would be way better off to buy a gun for your own safety|`|Hb3IrJ85aa	Making a zip gun really is not legal in most states.  to have one is a misdemeanor and in the firing state is a felony. Good luck any way|`|h2KkiKK3aa	one thing to tell you, youtube doesn't remove illegal content or all the explosive videos would be removed, and I hope you know owning any high explosive not including tannerite(exploding targets) is 100% illegal without the proper licenses(most people on youtube obviously don't have licenses) and can result in serious jail time. videos need to be reported to be removed, if not reported, they stay there, even though the content is illegal and dangerous, including acetone peroxide videos( high explosive)    now to your question, you need permission from the local gun authority to make a homemade gun, after it's finished, they need to inspect it and check if it's legal, if illegal, they take it without charge, but your not allowed to resist in the seizure or they'll charge you with something else, don't remember what.  now you would need a class 2 license to own the gun, so you need to get that.  that's all I know.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	It depends on which state you live in.  Zip guns are generally frowned upon, but may not be illegal.  Some states allow you to make them as long as they look like a gun, and not like something else.  However, you are stupid to risk both jail time and your fingers.  Unless you know what you are doing, you will end up with a new nickname.  Something like "Lefty" or "Stumpy".|`|nooi0ldjaa	legal or not, your not going to be able to make a "gun" at home unless you REALLY know what your doing.    a tater cannon you might be able to pull off, but making a firearm at home is not as easy as the movies make it look, if you don't know what your doing. and you could hurt your self or someone/something else.    and, you asked this in the wrong area unless you plan to hunt with it, and that's really not a good idea...

YsSwe1Laaa	As this is a rugby union Board, the rugby answer is straightforward:  BYU has a much stronger program, year-in and year-out.  There is a large rugby-playing population in northern Utah, with strong (certainly for USA) youth and high-school programs.  Many of the rugby-playing community, including the large and active PI population in the area, have connections to BYU though the Church.    If you are not LDS and you are from Arizona, or if rugby is not the point of your question, then ASU may be a very much better fit.  For what it's worth (a lot to me) ASU has one of the finest programs in geology and related earth sciences in the world.  It's a great major, and the basis for a great and interesting life.

5iqcdsWhaa	I would start by learning how to do all the basics:  regular skating- bend your knees and look forward not down. if you look down your probably going to fall.  after you have the regular skating down try doing crossovers. you usually do these on turns but some people like me like doing them all the way around the track. to do this you just cross your outside leg and put it in front of your other leg. its hard to explain.   Falling- knee falls! your going to want to learn how to fall small and safe especially when your in a pack. your going to want to go down on one knee and then to get up push on the knee that is not on the ground with your hands.  The last basic thing is the t-stop. while skating put one foot behind the other so that both your feet make a T.  All of this you will learn at newbie practices if your league has them. they probably do though.  oh- and invest in some good knee pads. its always better to have to pay $50 on some good kneepads than $500 on doctors bills|`|y96i0vfUaa	There are tons of youtube videos  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzFudCTwa...    Here's a helpful blog  http://www.roxyrockett.com/?m=200612    Other than that, skate. Go to a local rink, I bet they have lessons for basic skating. Practice.

I don't trust Sabathia past '09 as far as I can throw him, and it's really hard to throw a guy that weighs 300 pounds. Fat players rarely dominate much farther past 30, and Sabathia has pitched more innings (500+) in the last two years than any other pitcher which makes him an injury risk that he won't be able to bounce back from reliably. Burnett is a perennial injury risk and has pitched only 2 full injury-free seasons and one nearly injury-free. Hughes, Aceves, and Kennedy will be decent pitchers but none will be much better than  3 or  4-type pitchers. Joba will be fantastic in the future but he won't have much behind him.    Jeter, Damon, Posada, and Matsui are all getting older and increasingly injury-prone. They won't be stars for much longer and they'll all fall off at once. After they do fall off, it'll take 4-6 more years to build a team again, even assuming they take top free agents every year. By that time, A-Rod will be pushing 40 and Teixeira will be starting to decline. Hard to say what FAs they'll get but not even the Yankees can get superstar FAs every year.    Basically, I see them going downhill after '09.|`|frDcAqyWaa	2156|`|F65Km3Coaa	2999|`|eN6FkHIgaa	I am A BIG NYY Fan But I doubt it will be soon...:(|`|yNHkXmF6aa	I honestly think it will be within the next 2 years.

mOx4owULaa	McCarthy (thank goodness he's back) after him there is a drop off to Dean. Mazzagatti is the absolute worse ref in the short history of the sport. The idiot who stopped the Slice fight is bad as well.    Just so you know, the refs do not work for the promotion. The refs are licensed by the state and it is the state that sets the refs for each fight. The UFC, nor Affliction, pick the refs. Dana White has been highly critical of Mazzagatti (for good reason) but he will continue to work UFC fights since he holds a license in Nevada.|`|V2nAiEHkaa	Big John is and was the best!

oqiH3fCCaa	build up your mileage, there is no fast way to get speed, especially if you haven't been running recently. You should ideally have a large "base" of miles before you start really working on speed. But if speed workouts are shorter and very greatly I personally find that running hills is best for building speed. Be sure to have an easier run the day after or you feel terrible.|`|AA11425571	The only way to become faster is to run. Just start with a 10 minute or 15 minute jog and see how comfortable you feel. Then eventually build that up to more mileage and a faster pace and a longer time run.

It wasn't anyone's fault it was an accident..|`|uoIV59V6aa	hopefully they can|`|tY3rZSsiaa	the lakers did great last year without bynum, as long as gasol is playing.  they did goto the finals without him, so yea they can still win games.  in a 7 game series, weve seen how they fared against the celts without bynum.
8xyFCsMRaa	to be honest with you.  when i watch boxing i no longer care what flag the guy is actually representing.  in a similar topic, i discussed that the reason why the europeans and americans dominated the sport in the early years was due to lack of particiaption of other countries in professional sport. Now that everyone (except cuba and other muslim countries) is allowed to participate i think no country could dominate the present set up of pro boxing.  the sport is now global and it is up for grabs.  Cuba has been a power in the amateur ranks up to this day but they dont go professional.  i think they are the last talent laden boxing countrywho doesnt have a legit pro.  if they would be allowed to i think they are the only countryto have a shot at dominating pro boxing in all divisions.      now back to the issue regarding race or flag. i dont give this much consideration.  take for example the united states,  are there really pure americans (except for the american indians)?  caucasians are from european descent while african-americans originated from well... africa.  if their families did not migrate to the states they would be representing their countries of origin. the same holds true for those in the european union. even asians are half-americans or half-something.  so i dont really give emphasis on it.  i just consider the talent of a boxer and gauge his greatness through his achievements.  hell, sometimes i get confused if dela hoya is actually an american cause sometimes he claims he is mexican.  if he went on to represent mexico in that fabled olympic game he wouldnt be known as the golden boy (get it). one can argue which country is the best but for me it doesnt matter as even countries are now global.|`|SEEJxHk7aa	GOOD BOXING IS GOOD NO MATTER WHO OR WHERE THEY R FROM OF COURSE BEING MEXICAN I GO 4 ALL THE FIGHTERS FROM MEXICO OR OF MEXICAN DECENT BUT THAT BEING SAID I JUST LIKE 2 WATCH GOOD BOXING NO MATTER WHAT COLOR OR COUNTRY THEY R FROM        "  VIVA EL BOXEO"|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Your question isn't about boxing, it's about race, and your attacks on "America", and your personal attacks on me (your "typical evil America" as you put it) is in reality an attack on the success of "interracial relationships".  Fascist's use racial unrest to conquer people, when economic pressure isn't enough.  Politically, America is the ultimate interracial relationship, and that is why we saved Europe from the Fascist's during WW I & II.  It is also why America defines the standards for the rest of the world.  Morality is a form of strength.    During World War I & II Fascism was confined within the borders of "countries", and America defeated it.  During World War III Fascism is applied globally, it doesn't have the hindrance of "borders" or any particular country's politics, so it is more complicated.  But it is still the same Fascism, and by Fascism I really mean "Corporate run Politics", I do not mean anything ethnic.  Sun Tzu was correct in his statement that all Warfare is based on Economics, and the war my country is fighting is no different, it's economic.  Contrary to your insult, most Americans aren't typical as you define it, and time will tell who writes the history of World War III, it isn't over yet.  If you walked the battlefield on December 8th, 1944 you wouldn't have put much faith in the American military, but this isn't a history lesson.    As for your fragmented rant above, God sets the standard for excellence, and so long as America remains "one nation under God", that is a covenant with "The Almighty", same as the ones Abraham or Moses made, and so long as America keeps it's covenant with God, it is above earthly politics.  The fact that the ones who made the covenant a couple hundred years ago just happened to be doing so to escape European domination might offend you, but you don't hesitate to offend others so get over yourself.  History is written by the victor's and your bigotry doesn't change the fact that Europe lost and America won every significant war the two engaged in from 1776 on up to WW II, such is history.    Today, the battlefields are different, but the ideologies are still warring.  I tend to side with God, and define God in Christian terms.  Your accusations also have a place in Christian theology, it mentions something about "the accuser of the brethren" so I forgive your childish ignorance, you really "no not what you say".  Either you choose to be an intelligent, enlightened and moral person, or you remain ignorant, the choice is yours.      American's have a champion, it's the same champion that the rest of the world has.....God.
e7br8pIfaa	get a volleyball and work on your toss first. to consistently get a volleyball serve over, a toss that's about 2 feet above your head is recommended. do that repetitively until you're consistent, and then work on timing your arm swing so that it connects with the ball at the peak of the toss.|`|H8r7G1R5aa	I agree with working on your toss that is the first and foremost, after that start warming up at the 10 ft lone, throwing and serving from there, if you make it over take a big step back, if you get that one over take another big step back continue to see how far you can go and when you start to miss, practice from there and build up your arm strength. GOOD LUCK AT TRYOUTS!!|`|K6wIRsOIaa	I am 13 and on my school team also. When you overhand serve you should toss the ball so it lands in front of the foot on the side of your body you hit it with. Practice this a couple of times. My coaches say you shouldn't take such a big step when you go to hit the ball because you lose power. I guess you should try that first although it never worked for me. Do what you're comfortable with. When you swing you want to make sure your body is facing forward and you want to follow through with your serve. Make sure you don't cross your body or the ball will go out of bounds.    Good Luck!

When skating you want to get as deep of a knee bend as you can.  During practice, over bend them to train your muscles to get used to being "low" and it will translate into you being a more powerful skater.|`|imw5495raa	First of all, being low is a good thing. But obviously the awkwardness is not. The main thing to fix this problem is to get full extension of your legs as you skate. Also, you want to direct your legs outwards, not behind you.  All in all, remember to stay low, but not so your butt is dragging on the ice, bend your legs to almost 90 degrees, and extend your legs out all the way to the sides. If you follow these steps you should see improvement. Last, I don't know about your rink, but most rinks have skating clinics that can really help you out if you're still having trouble.|`|264GS7s7aa	being low is good  it doesnt matter how awkward you look if you are good
60XdQqgSaa	One of the best guides I've found is located at http://www.bicicletta.co.za/Downloadable... . If you read on the last page of the PDF, it gives some rough PSI numbers for different trail conditions.    Generally from my experience and from talking to other riders, go for the lowest pressure you can without pinchflatting to get the best grip in most situations. That pressure can greatly depend on your riding style, weight, and components, so you may have to just play around with it.     I usually sit on the bike and see how far it sinks, then bounce around on it. If it looks like you're close to hitting the rim, add some pressure. I guess I've always gone more on feel.|`|0oD59Xrbaa	lower pressure typically gives you better traction.  with this in mind, use lower pressure in softer sandy /muddy conditions and higher pressure in the hard packed dirt/street areas.  Also, stay in the pressure range stated on your tire.  If you stray to far from the recommended pressure you will be more susceptible to flats|`|5XmPittPaa	Assuming you are riding with standard tube tires as opposed to tubeless?  If so, I ride with about 35 or 36 psi in both front and rear, but sometimes 37-to-38 psi in the rear.  I feel this gives me the right all around balance between speed and performance/grip on my trails which vary greatly between rocks and logs to mud and creek crossings.  If I were riding on smoother, harder packed singletrack then I would go closer to 40 psi.

AA11694178	You are right, the 12 ga. wil have a bit more recoil than a 20 ga.  However, recoil can be handled by purchasing a pad that goes on your shoulder to absorb and dissipate much of the felt recoil.  These pads are manufactured by PAST company and sold by many sporting goods stores.  Cabela's sells some, too.  You can see them online at www.cabelas.com.  The catalog number is FJ-22-4114 for the right hand model and  FJ-22-4536 for the left hand model.  Another one is catalog number FJ-22-1947 and FJ-22-4308.  I use one of these when I shoot my heavy recoiling .45-120.  I can shoot a lot of rounds with it and not get a bruise.  They work very well.    The main advantage of a 12 ga. over a 20 ga is that a 12 ga. will have more shot in it than a 20 ga. and will give you an advantage over a 20 ga.  That is why you will see more 12 ga. shotguns at a skeet range than you will 20 ga. shotguns.  Where a 20 ga. shines is when hunting squirrels, rabbits, etc.  A 20 ga. is a lot lighter and easier to carry all day long than a 12 ga shotgun.  They are wonderful for hunting upland game, too.    Bottom line, buy a 12 ga. and get a shoulder pad if your main use will be skeet, trap, etc.  Your scores will be much better.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	As much as I like the 12 gauge cartridge the 20 gauge would be best for you....

Other Mossberg info....  http://www.chuckhawks.com/mossberg_500_5...|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	Here is the thing about recoil- it depends on the weight of the gun.    If you have a 7-1/2lbs. 12ga. Mossberg 500 firing a 1 ounce load of shot at 1200fps, it's recoil would measure about 13.65ft.-lbs..    If you have the 20ga. 500, which weighs only 7lbs. firing 1 ounce load of shot at the same 1,200fps., it's recoil would measure about 14.63ft-lbs.     With both guns shooting one ounce loads, the recoil of the 20ga. is greater than the recoil of the 12ga.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	I'd suggest you stick with a 20 until your shoulder develops and you gain the full weight of a young adult. A 12 will hurt, you'll get less shots off, and it will hamper the development of your aiming skills.    By the time you're 22, you'll be an expert, you'll be bigger,  and should have no trouble with the transition.    And when you're old like me, you'll go back to the 20, and still enjoy it.    Have a blast.|`|nooi0ldjaa	im 15 (will...in less then a month) and about your size and i can shoot my 12 gauge all day long...if your going to be hunting deer with it you need to get the 12 gauge.    unless the 20 gauge and 12 gauge you were shooting were the same make and model, you cant really judge the recoil from one another, to many things play a role in recoil to list them all...i have a small singe shot 20 gauge shotgun..when i shoot turkey loads it feels like a slug out of my 12 gauge would, because its smaller.    just go with the 12 gauge, you'll get used to recoil.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	If you buy a Limb-saver Recoil pad for either the 20 or 12 gauge it reduces the Recoil by 50%.* You can get one at Walmart in the Sporting & Camping Section of the store.*|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	A Mossberg can last a lifetime, my recommendation is to but a 12 you won't regret it. You can purchase an after market recoil pad to manage the recoil.. But you will be money ahead by purchasing the 12.  Especially if shooting skeet or trap. 12 guage loads you can buy on special, 20 guage unless you can find a decent dealer that dealers in case lots you will pay a premium for 20s if you shoot 2-8 rounds a week the price difference adds up, and truthfully, you will grow in a 12 anyway.|`|ovgxECKsaa	Either shotgun will be a good choice.  The kick on the 12 ga. is not significantly stronger than the 20.  I don't care who you are, if you shoot 75 - 100 shells in a day's time, you will be sore.  (unless you do it very often - then your muscles will get used to it)  Both guns are good choices.  For dear hunting, I would prefer the 12.  When your parents take you shopping for a gun, talk with the clerk, he/she can help you pick one that is right for you.|`|lAWi4Mv0aa	12 ga. you'll eventually grow into it.|`|hvjWpq2naa	20 or 12, agree with the others you will hurt throwing 75 rounds. since you want to hunt birds and shoot skeet, It might be more useful to you to consider the choke on your shotgun. I dont know the mosberg you want to use, perhaps you can get one you can change barrels on as well? for your purposes the 20 guage is appropriate. bird shot is great in either 12 or 20, even 10 :) you have to consider the pattern and range though.
fNIlnJNHaa	The other guy doesnt know what he is talking about. Ofcourse a dog can snowboard.    I have three dogs and one of them, skippy loves to snowboard.  The other two dont like to go out much. I trained the 2 of them to do programming in Java.  Now I have 2 dogs at home that do all my work which leaves me so much free time to snowboard with skippy.      The only thing that sucks is that I have to always strap him in to the bindings because he doesnt have opposable thumbs, but other than it its awesome.  Man you should see him do some tricks in the park.|`|jTaW3goeaa	if you're talking about the animal, no.  The dog would have absolutely no control of the board, and once you sent it going down the hill it would never be able to stop, and it would end up killing itself.    How would you feel if your dog ran into a tree and killed itself while snowboarding?  And I'm not even sure if resorts allow animals on the lifts.      Dogs snowboarding is one of the craziest things I've ever heard of
rG0TXDGeaa	No he does not! His problem that he does not really change his game to beat Nadal. Or in other words he does not do anything special to play him. Whereas Nadal managed to learn how to play Federer. Check Wimby finals 2006, 2007, 2008 and see how Nadal progressed. At the same time compare Federer's game - nothing new. The way he plays Nadal currently he has to be at the top of his performance 100% of the match in order to beat him. This is not possible. Federer has flashes of absolutely magnificent tennis (like in 4th set on Sunday) mixed with periods of poor play. He can afford it with everybody but Nadal. Note that Federer performance in 5 setters is not so good. And this is cuz on average periods of poor play overweight advantage gained during period of excellent play.   He needs good coach to analyze this situation and to learn how to cope with periods of poor play to minimize damage. Pete Sampras had a remedy for this situation - he had a solid serve. He could serve his way out of the slump. On Sunday Federer serve did not work and he lost as the result. He needs to do something with it.    I am Fedrer's fun. I am his fun cuz I like how he plays and I have not seen anybody play like him (when he plays at his best). Nadal is more consistent player and he wins on consistency. Federer is not enough of a fighter for Nadal.|`|9ekjMzbUaa	he doesn't play like he did when 22.very one dimensional.nadal picks fed's weaknesses.but fed doesn't do this.i think nadals backhand and variety of game.roger is better at volleys,better at slice.nadal can't volley,his slice is improved but not tested.his backhand is played two handed so has less reach.he doesn't have a lot of variety but he reads the game well,plays hard and long ,good at pinpointing weaknesses and tactics to counter.the roger of old.he's lost a bit of confidence,made too many errors and the serve shows he is a bit under the weather emotionally.variety is the spice of life,that will be roger turn around.i actually think he can win the french even though he's not good on it and that would have people talking.beating nadal on clay!imagine the headlines|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yup|`|QohItCUeaa	im a rafa fan gotta love his mental strength...but ultimately for me i  believe Roger has the natural foundations/talents to beat anyone...i think he needs an outsiders perspective to help guide him on tactic strategy etc....and lets face it we're all Roger fans too deep down..|`|mgIh5G89aa	YEAH!!!!! Federer rocks!!!! : )|`|75ZMWlnnaa	yeh federer can still beat nadal, but for gods sake, he needs a coach, however fed is extremely stubborn, and u can not blame him for being stubborn because he dominated the game for so long, and during his domination, he did not have to change up his tactics or his game plan, except when he faced rafa on clay.    at the moment, rafa is definitely the best player in the world, winning 3 majors on 3 different surfaces is no small achievement, it is a HUGE achievement.    if fed can make some adjustments to his game, especially fixing up that weak return of serve on rafa's 2nd serve (omg, that serve is coming at like 80MPH), then he can have a higher success rate on break point conversions.    fed has more than enough time to run around his backhand and just crank a forehand down the line to rafas backhand, i mean rafa's 2nd serve is a soft target waiting to get smacked. that is the MAJOR reason why fed lost the final, unable to capitalise on all these opportunities presented to him.    for me, wimbledon will be the true test for fed, if he loses to rafa once more, then id say the chances of him winning another major are getting slimmer and slimmer.    i want to see fed win another major, but he must hire a full-time coach between now and wimbledon if he is to succeed at doing so.|`|PLWdgGNeaa	Nadal is amazing... but u have to admire Federer's mental spirit, he never gives up... so can he beat Nadal? of course he can    and what a match it will be ;-)|`|EfGFtn4Waa	I think Nadal is at the top of his game and Federer may have to analise the way Nadal plays to beat him|`|iZA9SZftaa	I still believe he can, but he has to change his tactics a bit.  The primary area of concern is the return of serve.  He doesn't consistently attack nadal's weak second serves.  All he does primarily is put the ball back in play and Nadal can than dictate after that.  This might partially explain why Federer always has a very poor breakpoint efficiency against Nadal.  Also, this reminds me of Nadal's serve three to fours years ago when Nadal basically just started the point with his serve and hardly ever won cheap points.  If Federer's stubborn ways continue than he better be prepared for more marathon heartbreak matches.|`|ezxKSt5xaa	Yes i think he has the skills to beat Nadal. And he will win next time they both meet. I have faith in him. When Federer Nadal, Nadal cried 2 hrs in the shower. Maybe that shocked Nadal up a bit and urged him to practise harder. Maybe the same will happen to Federer|`|ppwUMCBJaa	NO, PERIOD...|`|IYxceupsaa	Roger has lost the confidence to beat Nadal. He could beat him I reackon, but he needs to play Nadal differently from other players. But, I can't see Roger beating Rafa in the near future. The Oz open final made that quite clear. Rafa has superior mental strength and is very stubborn. I don't think that Roger has those qualities as much as Rafa does. The ultimate street fighter!|`|La4EHNo7aa	He does have all the game needed, but he has lost confidence against Nadal after RG last year. Whenever he plays him now he plays negatively with no game plan. Whilst Nadal is quite the opposite.    P.S. If you wanna get serious answers you're better off asking somewhere else. this place is packed with groupies.|`|6W4vcjFhaa	Of course.  Federer needs a trainer.  I hope he finally gets it that he doesn't know it all.|`|pWkWEXRoaa	i think he can do it he just needs to focus more than before|`|MgiGZ51Zaa	Yep Federer knows he can crush destroy thrash Nadal|`|AA12050428	He was close to beating him in the AO. It was 3  -  2 can't get much closer than that.

That match was so important and it must be tough for him to handle. I support Federer 100% and i really wanted him to win. But Nadal was just too good for him. Federer will win next time. I know it and i hope it happens or i will cry before he does. I have faith in him.|`|YKDhstvkaa	he's the best|`|8HALBjQVaa	I didnt like it..I felt kinda sorry for the guy ...but he has to learn to control his emotions....yes..he is human and is an emotional person but so is the majority of the people in the world...Im sure that there are many emotional players like Roger but a guy with his experience   and success needs to know how to control himself in public...|`|f05463dc082c3c7c8280c54e35eada93aa	First, I feel sorry for him....but later I remember the other 13 players (including Nadal several times in Wimbledon, Roddick 2 wimbledon and 1 us open, Agassi just about to retire he lost 1 Us open final against him and many others that have lost the oportunity to in a Major) .
uk1e3zajaa	I think the fact that he has had more players sent off for "fouls " on him than any other player speaks volumes. And if a placid player like Frank Lampard can hate him I would say he is an annoying player only loved by the red half of Liverpool.|`|duJgBxUoaa	So when a players fouls him its his fault for the referee sending them off?    I love Alonso one of the best Midfielders there is!  a TRUE RED ;)|`|fEWhwumZaa	Oh yeah because he just invites people to go in studs up on his legs...|`|WS8MvKQAaa	i like him|`|El7C2JsMaa	just a coincidence i'm afraid, but its some more ammo we can use in our banter!    every player gives verbal abuse, i think you clutching at straws now!|`|3JRUgVhraa	Xabi Alonso is one of the best at his position in the premiership. I hope we never sell him. A true red at heart.|`|Rds4eGIyaa	I'm sure he likes getting studs up challenges from Cahill and Lampard and getting coat hangered by Vidic :) I think the reason for all the fouls on him is that he is half a yard slower than most epl centre mids and that he has a good footballing brain and likes to shield and dwell on the ball and wait for the right pass.|`|j3xwgrLBaa	Love the chap  long may he remain on merseyside :)  .....    and wasnt it Lampard that dived to get Alonso suspened for the 2nd leg of the champions league semis in 2005   .....  What goes around hey  only a thought|`|qcXehKInaa	He wasn't involved in the Lampard foul, that was Gerrard.|`|0lplyfe6aa	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....something is burning here ???    one of the best footballer in the world of football.|`|no3tD0OSaa	Why else do you think Liverpool signed him?

Then maybe you all could get together.|`|oXMT7Uqyaa	never even heard of that city.....try moving to florida or cali....they have the best academies
Zz4FGiAEaa	The basics of tennis are simple; backhand, forehand, and serve.  The forehand is the easiest.  The best way to learn is tennis lessons.  One tip is never to wear jeans or something that is not meant to be athletic wear to play tennis.  You also need to be fast and have hand-eye coordination.  Private lessons are better than group ones if you have the money.  The smaller the class the better.|`|9ekjMzbUaa	go out and play that's how.get someone to play with you your age and hit away.there is plenty of websites and doing yourself would be a start ratyher than letting other do it.rather lazy,kids these days.get up and play.
uh2bkRrFaa	It's not worth anything, I have the same card along with a bunch of other Hall of Famers I got in Santa Cruz when I was a kid in the 70s from a machine on the board walk. They're not worth anything. Of course the buffoon claiming it's worth a lot is just guessing. It's a reprint like utter is saying.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Thats an awesome find ! Dont sell it, it is prob worth a nice amount of money|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	It's probably an exhibit card from around 1948.  Exhibit cards were found in vending machines and usually cost a penny.  They are called Exhibits because they were made by the Exhibit Supply Company of Chicago.  They have been reprinted in the past so you'll need to make sure you have an original.  In decent condition it should be worth over $100 provided it's an original.
poEJEuwNaa	That is of course a subjective question, but I think it is the best and here's why. As with any player, he has good and bad days with the serve. But even his bad days are something most other players would be happy to have. When he is getting good placement to go with the awesome power he is virtually unhittable. Yes, Federer makes him look bad, but Federer is the best returner ever. Roddick has the capability to put the serve in any of the three main locations (down the middle, out wide, or into the body), and mix it up.     If you want some evidence, look at the stats. Roddick consistently leads the pros in percent of points won on the serve (first AND second). He even has a nasty kicker on the second serve that is very difficult to attack, so he doesn't give up easy points. And yes he does have the record for fastest serve.    I think Roddick's serve being so good has hampered the rest of his game. He hasn't really had to work hard enough on playing the points.|`|B64qsOquaa	yep he still holds the record of 155mph, thats crazy1    heres a vid of him actually doing it...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6OTEAidq...|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	He or karlovic have the best serve now, but all time best serve is pete sampras.|`|RC3WoqFkaa	no. it's hard to say exactly who has the best serve cuz a fast serve may not be as effective as a serve with heavy spin and a slower. it's true that he has the fastest serve in the world. 155mph|`|iZA9SZftaa	He has the fastest serve, but obviously as we've seen it doesn't necessarily correlate to the best serve.|`|oXMT7Uqyaa	he has the fastest serve, but i dont think its the best|`|YKDhstvkaa	yes its 167 or something.  he is not that good

Aside from browning most machine guns are made by foreign companies.  There is a large difference between a sub machine gun, and automatic rifle and a machine gun (Mg's also fall into three classes).  To possess a fully automatic weapon you have to have a class three dealers license, or be in law enforcement.  Its not too extremely hard to get a class three license if you are a good citizen.  There are quite a bit of rules if you actually posses a fully automatic.|`|2JPG1FHraa	Umm..and why do you need it?|`|DAtIypvzaa	fully automatic weapons are illegal to own in the US unless it is an old antique|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	corey is the only one who answered your question that knows what he's talking about as far as the full auto question goes.

RjQLB9s1aa	Fed split with his coach - Tony Roche at the French in 2007. His no 1 status at Wimbledon & the U.S. continued after Tony left, & was never questioned. In 2008, he was ill at the start of the year & never fully recovered his game. This year, 2009, has also started with a loss.     My thoughts are that Fed needs an expert coach - who will tinker with his game & remove the errors that are so apparent. I believe that is all that it will take.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	He doesn't look right since end of 2007, since he got mono.

Always ride defensively, it is the only way to ride and to live to tell about it.    Ride and ride some more - nothing is better than first hand experience.      After you gain the experience then move to the larger faster more powerful bike of your dreams.    Good luck and take care!
iZvr42Wuaa	Search on YouTube anything on Ray Allen's shot. He has the greatest shot in the leauge and if you look it up there will be a step by step process.|`|J1fxwkqraa	Hi Socks,     I wrote this article (below) last month which pretty much answers your question. As you can see, there are plenty of things you can do to improve your shooting.    Practice doesn't make perfect ... perfect practice makes perfect!    LEARNING TO SHOOT    When people ask 'how do I learn to shoot a basketball?', most of the time people tell them to just get out and practice. Grab a ball, find a hoop and just shoot ... you'll get better.    I tend to disagree with this statement. Sure, practice and repitition is important, but its just one part of the equation. Practice doesn't make perfect ... perfect practice makes perfect. Learn the right way to shoot, the best basketball shooting drills to work on and you'll become a great shooter much quicker.    We basically learn to do anything in 3 ways: by listening/asking, by watching or by doing. So applying these 3 ways of learning to the art of shooting a basketball you get:    1. Listening ... talk to other players, ask coaches    2. Watching ... watch people playing and shooting, watch games of professional players, watch instructional videos, get someone to video you shooting so you can see your own shot (and you can see what you're doing right and wrong)    3. Doing ... practice shooting, repitition, playing    So if you really want to improve your basketball shot, don't just learn by doing ... seek out people for advice and when you're not on the court, watch great shooters and learn from them. As well as just practicing your shot, use the others way of learning (and some of the suggestions above) and you'll find your shooting will improve much quicker.

oPbLcfKoaa	AHA! You have discovered one of the strange things about Fulcrum wheels. Fulcrum has 2 different Shimano compatible freehub bodies. One is black and one is silver... my bet is that you have the silver one.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	Newer 10 speed Shimano cassette bodies have deeper splines than older 8-9-10 speed bodies. You can put a 10 speed cassette on the old style body, but you can't put an 8 or 9 speed cassette on the 10 speed cassette body. To use your 8 speed cassette on those wheels, you have to change the body, a 5 minute job.

Jhoon Rhee often receives credit but this cannot be verified.

James|`|r5AMG8g7aa	I believe James24 is most correct here. Although Jhoon Rhee is mentioned most often as the father of TKD in America, I've heard since way back on the mid 1960's that someone else was actually the first one to bring TKD here. I don't think anyone can prove that Rhee was the first. It has just become accepted over time that he was the one. It is like a lot of other myths that have become believable after many years, but are in fact incorrect.

My parents are like that because we have many houses in the woods. so try a gamo or crosman would be good for rabbits and squirls|`|Fp50ZK2Laa	yes, crosman is the best make you can get, especially for the money. You might be asking for too low a price at 150, if you would spend 200, you can get a awesome break barrel form them. They are a good (not the best) source for scopes. They are also tied with gamo for best ammo. You generally shoud use the crosmal pellets for their guns. The crosmal pellets are made way better. (i have found that out the hard way before). you should really consider spending the extra $50, it will be really worth it.|`|PnS3wHQiaa	I don't know about their pellet guns, but from my experience, their aisoft guns are junk so I have no reason to think their pellet guns would be any better. Maybe get a Beeman instead.
oPbLcfKoaa	May I make a suggestion?    Instead of going to Target or some department store to buy a bike for school, look around for a better quality used bike. They are always in the newspaper, on craigslist.com, or at places like Salvation Army or Goodwill. A local bike shop may even have a selection of used or closeout bikes.    You will very likely be able to find a bike from companies such as Raleigh, Trek, KHS, Specialized, and others for about the same as you would spend on the low end stuff you'd find at a discount retailer and they will last you MUCH longer and give you less grief.     To make it easier on you while buying a bike, I'll suggest that you stay away from Mongoose, Schwinn, Magna, Next, or any other brand name you might find at a discount store. Many companies make both discount-variety and bike shop quality bikes but they are hard to tell the difference for a novice. Also, stay away from bikes with full suspension- shocks on the front and back, choosing instead a bike with no suspension or one with front suspension only.|`|cdb7510f11b08036cfff90d2a8e22235aa	I made a mistake and gave a thumbs  down to 'by the cheap'; should have been a thumbs up!    Real good bikes get stolen lots in college.    Get a good quality used bike in good condition, lights, racks and fenders.  good lock and chain.      park next to a fancier bike|`|4a0Akgieaa	Target sells bottom of the barrel bikes, as do all bargain stores. Heavy, clunky junk. I bought my son a Diamond bike from Dick's a few years ago. I worked in a bike shop for years and have a Cannondale myself. I did quite a bit of looking for something not too expensive for him, but not a clunker either, and came up with the Diamond bike. If you have any dedicated bike shops in your area, stop in there, they carry good bikes in a large price range and they can help you with the type also. If you will be road riding, I would look at a hybrid.|`|mJFgCvYlaa	Kudos on your decision to invest in a bike! You are absolutely correct in a college a bike is the best way to get around, especially a college town where everything is less than 2 miles away, and you pay up the wazoo for parking, not to mention insurance, gas, repairs, and loan payments.  Since you are starting out, your best bet right now is go to a good bike shop, and ask for advice. Bike shops are usually run by someone who really loves bicycles, instead of wage collectors in department stores like Target. They also sells bottom quality bikes that can only last less than 100 miles before something breaks.    Even if you budget a bike for $1000, it will pay for itself in the years in  high school and in college as well. What a typical good budget would be about $300-400, and about 100 in must have accessories like a trusty lock, water bottle, lights and maybe a speedometer (cyclocomputer is the term) to track your mileage.   Like I said, best place to start is a bike shop. Go to one and talk to the sales rep, if he/she loves bicycles they will answer your questions all day long, and show you what to look for. Like shopping for a car, you don't want to buy one right at the first visit, but visit a few shops and compare.     Brand Recommendations: The 3 most popular brands are Trek, Specialized, and Giant. Some other good brands are GT, Fuji, Bianchi, Jamis, Cannondale, etc. Mongoose and Shwinn are sold in department stores and real bike shops, the ones in the bike shops are pretty decent.     Regarding the type, the best for around campuses is a hybrid road bike. Basically a road bike but with flat handlebars, and no shocks. They are simpler in design so nothing complicated can break down, but are fast enough to get around comfortably and has gears to go up hills. See the link below for an example.     The most important factor in a bike is the fit, you need to get the bike in the right size and fit you comfortably, and again a good shop will fit you. The second most important thing is that you like the look/color/etc of it, so that you'll want to ride it everyday.    Good Luck!|`|de7215341349f0d0bbb073031301015caa	If you have enough money go with Cannondale(Scalpel  :)  ),Trek,Giant,Specialized,Scott,Kona middle range models ,in this order.  If not,go with the same names but less equiped,the entry level. A good frame is crucial.  Some wise guy said : "We are to poor to buy cheap things."|`|q5fZFJGtaa	Buy a bicycle at a bicycle shop.  The bikes at big stores will be put together by big dummys that could give a crap about you and your bike purchase from their store.  Go to a bicycle shop, you will spend the same money than at tarwallkmart and you will look at the people that put your bike part to part wheel to wheel without stripping bolts and the like.

Not the top of the line, but surely far from the bottom.    But the biggest thing is that you have to feel good going to the plate with it - or any bat.

svbFM4Zyaa	My friend shot a 6 under par in one golf competiton in high school and went to state and took second. He was offered scholorships by good schools and ended up going to one. I would say that you golf pro is right. I used to be an assistant and would say that low 70's are good enough for some schools to give you an offer but for d1 I would say mid to high 60's would be the numbers to be at. To get a scholarship you need to talk to the schools your interested and get them to notice you or have your coach talk to them about you. I would tell you this as well: You will get into the 80's easily and maybe even the high 70's but every stroke from 78 down is very hard to overcome. I have shot under 70 once and it was a very good round. Good luck!!!!|`|F65Km3Coaa	i hope you will because i score the same  but no those numbers are not to impresseive|`|P38VHyPHaa	im a freshmen and i shoot low to mid 70s and the colleges dont look at you unless you play in ajga or fcwt all the other competition is inferior|`|ebDmeoyNaa	The difference between D1,D2, and D3 is huge, why dont you go and check these  Junior sites and they will give you more info on what you need to score.     www.ajga.org  www.njgs.com|`|ajkMt6gRaa	You need to improve a great deal.  If you shoot like that at age 16 ,   Look at working a lot more on your game. those that want any scholarship are very aggressive about practice, and studies.

TH1fT6rdaa	I am an MMA fan, but nobody can say UFC 94 came close to Superbowl XLIII in any aspect.    UFC 94 did receive a lot of hype with the constant commercial ads and UFC PrimeTime TV show, but the Superbowl is the biggest TV event every year.  UFC 94 probably had the most views for any MMA event in history, but the Superbowl gets around 50 million viewers every year.    Also, in terms of excitement, Superbowl XLIII was one of top ten superbowls ever.  There was Santonio Holmes' tip-toe game winning touchdown catch.  There was James Harrison's 100 yard endzone-to-endzone interception touchdown for the last play of the first half.  There was Kurt Warner's 377 passing yards and 3 touchdowns.  UFC 94 was a great event, but it was nothing compared to the excitement of the Superbowl.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	gsp of course! the football game was good but was nothing like the beating that penn took.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Superbowl. It pitted an "underdog" against a favorite. Momentum shifted back and forth. And the decision came in the last 30 seconds of the hour-long game.    Meanwhile, Penn was never threatening GSP.

Definitely the Superbowl.|`|AA11517536	Well, I was more excited about the GSP/Penn fight than I was about the superbowl.  My team, the NY Giants, weren't involved, so my interest for the superbowl was at around 75%.  The game was very exciting though, especially the end.      The GSP/Penn fight was fun to watch because I don't like BJ Penn, but it was so lopsided that it wasn't all that exciting.|`|yNNQ0yk0aa	I was way more excited for GSP/Penn for sure.

Cl6KbcAGaa	As previously stated this is not an XC frame!   There is NOTHING CUSTOM ABOUT THIS BIKE EITHER! this looks more like a Jump bike and the components are low end and I do not believe that any other items listed are that much better. V brakes are ok but dated, meaning that most bikes of this type these days are disc equipped and your rims are most certainly on the lower end of the spectrum. I most certainly would not pay more than $200 for any of this. Your Acera front and rear are bottom of the line Shimano and the lowest component group that Shimano supports on their website, cheap enough to replace when you break them, about $24.00 for each and even cheaper....sorry but I have had and still do have a real XC bike that you can compare to: Iron Horse Azure Comp and have had the Sport too.

axxQzOCHaa	My closest NHL team is the Dallas Stars, about a 10 hour drive each way assuming traffic is light which it rarely is, especially after you get to Waco. (near Austin)    That said, I will base it on the CHL team I have season tickets to - it's a 15 minute drive, but I usually bike it, takes about 40 minutes assuming it's not too windy.    If they moved / relocated .. I'd rather not imagine that. Hockey has been part of my life for much too long for me to imagine not going to games, and without a team to root for, the local rink (which the CHL team often uses as a practise rink, and where I play in the adult league) would have even more trouble making ends meet as few if any locals would develop an interest in the sport, and us die-hards can only be there so much.    Financially speaking - tough to say at this point. I'm not made of money, and rent PLUS out of state tuition is taking quite a bit of my savings as is ..    News flash Patrick: I read somewhere there are more pro teams in Texas than Ontario (as in the Canadian province, not the suburb of L.A.) .. how you like them tamales eh?    About the debts Howler - I don't have any. But an interesting proposition nevertheless.    Another message for Patrick here - I agree about Winnipeg and Halifax being worthy, but Kansas City .. they couldn't even keep the Scouts for a couple years.|`|UoUaO52taa	Very little. Say I relocated to Atlanta. My heart would still be w/the Sabres and I'd spend money on going to Sabres gms whenever I'm in western NY to visit family. I may catch a game, especially one vs. Buffalo and would watch them on TV (Only team)    I barley get to alot of Sabres gms. Only gone to 2 last yr and will be 2 this yr (2-11 vs. Ottawa, 3-25 vs. Florida)    Howler: I would catch Sabres games in Atlanta. Especially playoff games.  Hence: I may catch a game, especially one vs. Buffalo and would watch them (The Thrashers) on TV (Only team avaliable)    Thanks. It was a good game. Very physical. Just glad MSG picked up the game here.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	I would put an ECHL team first and if that is sucessful I would move the AHL team of Houston, or San Antonio, and put a team in there and if it doesnt make good enough money I would move themand Dallas to Austin. There are plenty of other cities that deserve teams other than the Sunbelt. Winnipeg, Kansas City, Seattle, and Halifax are all worthy of NHL teams rather than any team in the Sunbelt.|`|P32Y2ioMaa	KANSAS CITY WORTHY OF A TEAM??!!!!! What the hell are you smoking? They cannot even sell out a Royals game in that hill billy town. How do you expect them to fan stock an NHL franchise? I used to live there, so I am not just talking out my a$s. I know what it is like there.      I used to also live in Norfolk, Va and I supported the Admirals whilst I lived there. I would go out of my to go to a game, but then again, I was also a rare die hard hockey fan in those parts of the country.

qAlrpec0aa	Watching an NHL video clip on Killer Jerseys, it was said that the NHL allowed it due to the regulations set fourth on the "Alternate Jersey Rules" the league has in place.    As long as Detroit agreed to let the blues wear the jersey (obviously for marketing reasons) then it was good to go. Usually this kind of deal is two way, don't be surprised to see the reverse between these two teams some day!|`|hHXG8ef6aa	to change it|`|9vLzGwVqaa	It's their choice!|`|jGzIMKF3aa	just to change it up, i guess|`|z93tSvKxaa	I thought they wore red.|`|ACaCgLkKaa	It looks like they are wearing them because St Louis wanted to wear their alternate darks tonight.  Personally I like the whites at home, like the way things used to be.|`|70ixZ5geaa	Probably just to change it.|`|CXiud7Qcaa	umm idc islanders are better lol... well 4 my opinion y dont u go on the website or somthin and ask>>>>lol|`|wS1ePD8haa	well the blues away jersey is white and they are wearing their alternate tonight.  Maybe there is a league rule that mandates certain jerseys be worn if the home and away jersey share the same color.  i.e. white accent on wings home jersey and the white blues jersey.  I liked it better when the wings wore white at home anyway.  GO WINGS

(They can put him back in anyways, but that kinda ruins the whole point of taking him out).|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Yes but only If the Empty Net He leaves serves as a Goal, otherwise the coach Benches the Goalie, Got it.|`|YTwnVAtdaa	yeah it's legal.

MfxHpLVWaa	I have the same problem... my ears are TINY. I could never seem to find a pair that would stay in while I was running. The only pair that works for me is those new Skull ones that have the rubber thingy that goes in your ear, they are expensive but they are amazinggg!!! They block out all other noises and the base is really good. And they actually stay in too :)|`|3tnistZQaa	The Sony $10 earphones with those ear loops lasted me a pretty long while and they're decent enough.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Ditto above; I found that the "ear-bud" styles just don't stay in my ears during exercise. I was constantly trying to seat them in my ears, which distracted from my workouts. The "ear-loop" variety stays in place and they sound alright, you can get a good pair from various brands for around $20.
XQoH9ZI5aa	Manon Rheaume. It was just an exhibition game gimmick though.     Fortunately, as most everyone knows, the only two things that Canada successfully exports are hockey players and ugly women. The introduction of the Women's National Hockey League (WNHL) takes the remarkable step of combining these two great exports into a product as yet unseen in the world market. (Some would argue that the WNBA exploited this niche first, but the WNBA has yet to be exported successfully. Or even had any interest generated in its home country, for that matter.)  Nike, long famous for their hesitation to exploit workers in developing nations, has promoted the WNHL as "wonderful, exciting, sexy and progressive," according to reports on Reuters, adding, "check out our full line of WNHL authorized fashion hockey gear at your local retailer, with deep discounts on select apparel through Ground Hog day!"    Combining Canadian women with the Canadian pastime conveniently sidesteps certain problems inherent to both. For instance, in hockey, it is not uncommon to see people playing with missing teeth. Conveniently, many Canadian women come into the sport already missing teeth (primarily from opening bottles of Labatts with their teeth). Additionally, it is normal to see hockey players playing with nasty bruises to the face and black eyes. Again, conveniently, many Canadian women (at least from the French sector) are battered by their husbands, and therefore look the part.  How is the country that gave us William Shatner taking all of this? In stride. Ay, we think its all a big ado aboot nothin, ay, said WNHL spokeswoman Cassie McDougal. The WNHL isnt just aboot hockey, its aboot firin up the hormones of our Canadian men. Ill betcha didn know that theres less sex in Canada, per capita, than there is in Vatican City. And why not? Look at us! We women are hideous, and the men are drunkards. We thought that maybe combining a sport with sex appeal  what we can get, at least  might just be the thing that finally sets the Canadian population climbing by something other than immigration, she opined, adding, ay?    To that end, the women of the WNHL will be dressed similarly to the women of Americas Lingerie Bowl of 2004. They will compete in panties and bras with minimal padding (except perhaps in the bras) over top. Genevieve Carlotta, a WNHL athlete out of Montreal, states, Its nice to finally be recognized as a sex symbol. I mean, all these years Ive been schlepping firewood and tossing down brewskies, nobody has ever looked at me just for my body. Its always whats in your mind, whats in your mind? Well, guys, I think I speak for all the women of Canada when I say theres nothing going on up there! So just come give me a squeeze, take a tumble, and lets start making some babies for Canada. She added, Ay?"|`|axxQzOCHaa	Manon Rheaume for the Tampa Bay Lightning, a preseason / exhibition game in 1992 against the Blues    yo Patrick = let me know when you are ready for a lesson in spelling, it's Primeau.    lol @ puck .. it would explain the pink lipstick and lack of scars on his / her face eh?|`|70ixZ5geaa	The first women to play in the NHL was Manon Reaume.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	Manon Rheaume the first and certainly the last because Keith Preimuea is trying to start up the WNHL (Womens National Hockey League) similar to the WNBA it is going to comprise of a smaller league but the first pro womens hockey league in the States and the States hat (Canada).|`|oxQLM0BTaa	Flyers Defenseman Checks Sarah Palin    http://hockeyhumour.co.cc/index.php?team...|`|1e517d457abe5a99863a757df71245e3aa	Why would u pick that Bob guy as top contributor.

d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Well that depends on what exactly you mean. It is legal to race it, but taking the jumps on pretty much any real race track would destroy the bike and most likely you along with it. If you are an absolute beginner that is happy with just getting out there, rolling over all of the jumps and finishing last just for the experience of being part of a race, it can be done. Just understand that riding in this manner is dangerous to you and the rest of the racers on the track. It is very easy to get landed on in a race while rolling jumps since you are in a blind spot often times. Your best bet is to find a place that has a beginners practice track with very small jumps and just ride that until you are ready to move to a race bike.|`|w8D8GNWsaa	Yes you can in America.|`|qM4cMNufaa	you can race anything|`|b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	I would not advise anyone to attempt to race one as they are not designed for the impact that mx puts a bike through.

But if in Australia the answer would be no.|`|k6Sbm9qCaa	No it would be dangerous and you would loose because the bike is flimsy and will most likely break the fram or sub frame... bad idea get a crf150r and then u can rip the track up and kick ***

Y4mz8BShaa	SUPPRESSOR.     1. UHC, good quality spring rifle, and likely one of the best listed.   2. They give you two stocks, how nice. Great way to bring the spring up, but as far as spring rifles go, it's okay.   3. UHC, somewhat decent spring rifle, but a mock suppressor won't mount.   4. The UHC Super 9, and all of it's incarnations, are garbage. Next.   5. Good range, decent FPS, and all around a decent spring rifle.   6. If you don't feel you can carry a full M14 comfortably. Decent spring rifle.   7. If you're going to get a bolt action, just skip all the lesser known clones and grab a BAR 10. Stock, it's far better than the TM in all aspects, and almost, if not all, internal parts can be replaced an upgraded. If you're going to get a spring gun and have $100 to spend, this this the thing to spend it on.    Good luck finding any upgrade of after market part for a spring rifle that's not a bolt action. Scopes are overkill, you don't have the range to make them useful.

It gives you more grip on the ball when your catching it. As QB when you hike the ball, the gloves help you control the ball so your able to get a good crisp pass off. They help as a center by giving more grip for a easier to handle hike.

Fl1MqgJRaa	ok well, of course tons of stretching is necessary. Unless you are willing to pay tons of money for private lessons... Your mirror is honestly your best coach. Practice simple cheers such as "Go! Fight! Win!" a couple times. Make up your own motions, this will help you also. Being in front of the mirror can show you how much sharper, and tighter your motions need to be to look clean. Also while in front of the mirror practice your facials big time! Yes, yes you will look a little goofy, but the means your doing it right. Just whatever you do, the number one facial {not} to do is stick out your tongue, it comes across as offensive to the judges and audience. Tumbling is also a key factor. If you can't do much that's ok. A clean round-off is worth a lot more than a sloppy back-handspring, but then of course if you can tear up the mats go for it! *have a couple cheers you made up youself ready in case they ask you to do your own material. They can be easy as all get out, just be prepared.    During try-outs:  To wear: a solid color shirt, and a solid color pair of shorts. Avoid words as much as you can, turn a shirt inside out if you have to.    Hair: pull it back and clip it. People want to see your smiling faces... not for it to be covered with hair.    Make-up: don't over do it. A natural look is really all you need. But some pretty eye shadow and sparkles is always good.     Overall just rememeber to smile all the time, never let it down. Have sharp motions, be perky and such. Also after your cheers and chants it helps to do a little bit of spirit afterwords such as winking shaking your hair with your hands or adding the additional "Lets go_____(team)"  have fun =].|`|m3iPgBWFaa	you just need to practice!!!!!!.....  STRETCH all the time! I should know about that. You might want to consider dance classes or a tumbling class.... I am doing a tumbling class right know it is really fun. I also recommend Cardio Cheer by Paula Abdul its a really good exercise video and it will help improve your flexibility, jumps, moves, power, and endurance. I hope that helped...but you mostly just need to practice.    peace love cheerleading!|`|J5nnqrx0aa	practice practice practice!  make your motions strong, and dont have floppy arms.  also be very energetic and work at your flexibility--it dosent just come overnight (Im a dancer...I know these things :]])    good luck and I hope that you make it!|`|YKDhstvkaa	practice everyday and be energetic,  that's important for a cheer leader.

37evQRaDaa	Apparently nobody wants to answer your question.  They just want to berate you for saying "fixed gear" because if you're asking a question about fixed gear you're obviously some newbie who's horning in on their exclusive fixed gear scene.      Here's what I was able to find:   SE Lager 21.5 pounds  Bianchi Pista 20 pounds    I'll spare you the diatribe about which one you should buy, since that wasn't the actual question.|`|Fx5BENIxaa	I would highly advise you not to get a fixed gear unless you have years of experience riding bikes. a bianchi is a track bike and you shouldn't buy it if your some dick wade buying into a fade or if you don't have a velodrome near you. if you think you can ride a fixed gear on the roads and if you have enough experience and your not heeding my warnings get a SE larger to start of with, than if you like it and get into true cycling, maybe an upgrade would be appropriate.|`|d759a5d5755c3cee2925fe6f7160c2f2aa	The Pista is more suited for the track than the SE Lager. This means the steering of the Pista will be more sensible than the Lager due to a higher head angle. And just by eyeballing the frame, it looks like the Lager has more fork rake which adds more straight-line stability. It will be more forgiving than the Pista. So if you're going to ride it on the road, go with the Lager because the geometry is more comfortable and it's probably a softer ride. Neither of these are true track bikes, so you don't have much to worry about regarding comfort.|`|q5fZFJGtaa	Does it matter?  Both are wafer light.
GZpwkL1Vaa	First of all, you better hope your running something under 4.5 in the 40 if your hoping to make a college team with no football expeirience, it is deffinetly not a game you can just throw on the shoulder pads at such a high level and be good. But if you are lucky enough to make a college program, your coaches will make that decision for you so I wouldn't worry to much about it. It's impossible to judge what position a player should play without coaching them or at least watching them play, but if your looking for a position to train for I would suggest cornerback. If you have the speed to keep up with receivers that would be the best fit because small hands usually makes it difficult catching the ball, a problem that would be more hidden at corner. Also at such a light weight you would have problems taking big hits as a reciever or runningback, or making the big hits expected by a safety.    Best of luck.|`|vFasAFBUaa	Holder|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	Water Boy|`|WTQtchbvaa	Sorry. You wouldnt even make it on the HS school i played for. 145 pounds is VERY small. Unless you run like a 4.3 forty, you will not be able to do anything. Definetly not free safety, you are 5'9 145, you are not gonna gain 40 pounds in a year or 2 unless you juice (DONT JUICE). Small WR are only successful if they are 4.3 fast and have excellent hands. Corners have to tackle receivers, and rbs, some of which are 6'4 220 pounds. Speedback, no. What do you think will happen to you when a 230 pound LB or a 300 pound lineman tackles you full speed? Football is fun, I have played for 6 years. I was bigger than you when I was a freshmen in HS, but I was still small compared to some other guys playing my position.|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	oh boy...|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	hate to break it to you but life isn't just that easy|`|LtOxnF0kaa	What is Speedback???????|`|kG9rY5F9aa	dont even try  im not saying cuz im mean but cuz i know that your gonna get jacked up  u no 175lbs is still very light for college and u will get jacked up  all the stats u show is average for jv football high school team  and planning to play college? how bout water boy|`|FPjIOlSAaa	if you mean running back that would be a good position  or a freesafety|`|C2CCbTRKaa	how far can you kick the ball,that might be a good position for you.|`|Lg6nA574aa	I say the Wide Reciever but u dhould try to do wats best for u or that ur experienced. [BUT IF UR NOT EXPERIENCED AT ALL, I SUGGEST U DONT TRY OUT UNTIL U KNOW UR GOOD AT FOOTBALL] Like wat evry1 else had said, if ur not that fit and doin those small weights, u wont get far. If u r gonna stay were u r, do that about three time a day.|`|2lb9sPcLaa	ya i was considered small and im 5'8 and 225 so you would need to hit the weights really hard during the off season, like 2 times a day and drink mad protein shakes and weight gainers and maybe you could make corner back so you dont have to hit as much|`|BGOPARrTaa	life is not easy bro but if that wat u say.. i think u should be a linebacker!!!!! especially if ur fast and explosive.. best spot for u and its fun.. u get most of the tackles if u dont get burn! stick wit ur dreams neva give up cause it will come true someday!!!!|`|ssYy21DNaa	listen dude, **** all these guys on here who doubt you. If you have a dream go for it man and dont quit.     If you get to 185+ I would say a free safety given your info. Try a weight gainer like cytogainer. Your a little short for wide receiver, but if you have good hands and are you are explosive like you say then go for it dude.|`|khTuZrVsaa	Unless you're talking about D3, I wouldn't go out for the team.  Also you shouldn't bench more then you squat, that doesn't make sense.  In football leg strength is more important then upper body strength because you're power source is your lower body.  I would work on your leg strength, and try and go for "speedback."  It will be too hard for you to play defense if you don't know how to tackle.|`|kGRkjw6Qaa	You don't know the level, you may say stuff now but when the helmets get put on and the pads start popping your body might take a while to get used to it. You don't know what it feels like when your neck and traps hurt for the first three days, or the feeling of taking your helmet off for the first time and then letting it mold to your head for a few weeks. Or hitting somebody , seeing colors and still running to make a play. You have never had to enter the first day of classes dizzy because of three a days in 95 degree heat for the 2 weeks before school. Yes, I bet you will work hard, but because you never played organized football and you are pretty small even for D3, it will take time. I suggest going out for safety or corner back if your speed is what you say it is. Most likely, walking on the coaches will kinda put you where they want you, you will be on special teams for while.    I know a lot of players in D3 because I played with them in high school and they all played for a good amount of time, those kids are good, the ones I know couldn't play any higher because of academics. But I play D1AA and got recruited by tons of D3 schools. You have to be good, solid. Just work harder than you even imagined and you will do ok.     Good Luck|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	All the one's you just said and its runningback or halfback.
8MUj24s6aa	You may be able to sell all of that for the price you originally bought the gun for. You will not be able to re-coop all of your money but the most of it.     Your best bet is to go to a gun shop and sell it by consignment. They would also help with the price for you too. That is if they do not want to buy it directly.|`|ICtaFQxYaa	Yep..these suk for everyday all day deep concealed carry.    I'd market it for $600-$700 with the goodies.  low end for quick sale.  You wount make out good in a trade with an FFL.  Private sale is most desireable.    OR..    You could keep it.  Get a glock 30 or 36 for IWB CC.  I always regret selling my guns. Just dont do it anymore ;)  Unless you want to get a way from .45acp....which at this point in time, i can understand.|`|43V1pN2Taa	that depends on how much you paid for it was it origonally yours do you still have all papers etc.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	go to glocktalk.com  go to their for sale area  look what others are selling them for.|`|hphqiBEuaa	I would keep the gun, who knows whats going to happen in a few years laws wise, it could be worth much more, when it is banned to buy new ones. Keep the surefire x300, you can use it for your other gun.    If you really want to sell, sell everything separately.    The surefire x300 new is like 250. If yours is in the box untouched sell it for like 225.    The glock is worth around 500, contingent on what kind of sights it has on it. Fifty dollars more if they are night sights. The mags should come with the gun. At this present time it is hard to get glocks with the obama scare, so you can command that price. Normally you could sell it for like 400 or less.    Throw the blackhawk sherpa in the garbage. It is a dangerous holster that you shouldn't allow in circulation. To much has be published on how it causes negligent discharges.|`|WzzzVk7Baa	On the Glock,I would ask $500 for all and start there.Depending on your State,you will usually get the best price selling to individual at a gun show.Just make a sign to hang on the carrying case and work it for several hours.someone will get close to your price,especially late in the day.

The 48 used to be very common on MTB's from way back but nowadays with the emphasis on urban bikes the bigger rings seem to have dissapeared. What components are you running.

Here are some pictures.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	http://world.guns.ru/handguns/hg172-e.ht...    "During the early sixties a small company MB Associates, founded by Robert Maynard and Arthur Bill, brought up a new weapon that was intended to revolutionize the world of small arms. Known as Gyrojet, it was sort of hand-held, multi-shot rocket launcher. It was advertised as a silent and capable to fire under-water, but in real life Gyrojet weapons turned out to be extremely unreliable and dramatically inaccurate; also, these weapons were rather ineffective at point-black distances, gaining its full power only at ranges of about 40-60 meters (yards). Few of the Gyrojet "pistols" made its way to the jungles of Vietnam in the hands of US military officers, who bought them at their own funds, but no successful reports ever appeared, and by late sixties the Gyrojet project was doomed.

I left to eat an oreo shake for about 7 minutes and I come back into my room and the Lakers are up by 13.  I was like WTF!  The Rooster (Danilo Galinari) is playing great but he is on the bench.  So is Jeffries.  Robinson is playing horrible.  Take him out.  They need this lineup in  PG:  Chris Duhon  SG:  Wilson Chandler  SF:  The Rooster  PF:  David Lee  C:  Jarred Jeffries  Al Harrington has been very inconsistent.|`|dDhTMacAaa	ooo potty mouth ANthony|`|BfwzbKSoaa	HA. Kobe is dominating right now. You can't stop him just by taking Nate out of the game, or will that hurt you even more?|`|tnqO91xoaa	KB24 in full effect|`|EKF2HdZKaa	cmon.....theres still hope........
325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	In Brazil there was the long standing "Vale Tudo" style bareknuckle fights.  There were no weight class, no time limit and very few rules brawls to determine who the toughest guy around was.  The art of Gracie Jujitsu was forged in these matches, and in their "street rules" challenge to anyone in the world.  Helio Gracie (RIP, Professor) actually took out ads in the newspaper challenging all comers.  Something along the lines of "if you want to get your face beat, and your bones broken, call this number."  - Seriously.      Decades later, Helio's son Rorion wanted a way to bring the excitement of this style of fighting to the USA, mostly as a way to promote Gracie Jujitsu.  So together with a small number of partners he put out ads for the "World's Best Fighter Competition" in martial arts magazines and schools all over the country.  The resultant competition was eventually renamed "The Ultimate Fighting Championship."  The first one was held in 1993.    What happened was amazing.  Sumo wrestling vs. Savat.  Kenpo vs. Kickboxing, Boxing vs. Jujitsu, etc.  All in an eight man, bare knuckle open tournament.  It was like pulling the veil back on the age old question of which style was better.    But as the competitions continued, it became clear that a lot of styles had something to offer.  That the best fighter was a versatile combination of striker and grappler, that conditioning was as important as technique.      And as the sport was derided as barbaric and unsafe, rules were added to protect the fighters (and the promoters.)  In UFC 6 Tank Abbot hit the ring wearing the now familiar fingerless gloves, and delivered a knockout like the UFC had never seen.  Turns out that the head is a lot harder than the knuckles and for real power striking you need to protect your hands.      Dana White and Zuffa stepped in and rescued a nearly bankrupt UFC, adding marketing skills and a standardized rules system that could pass the gauntlet of the various state boxing commissions.    With the addition of the Ultimate Fighter TV show, and with fighting camps opening up all over the world, modern MMA competition had finally arrived.  Now it is the fastest growing sport in the world.  IMHO, it will soon eclipse all other combat sports.  In fact, you could make an argument that this has happened already.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	MMA, as it is known, has a long history in the US. Most of them began as toughman contests in bars back in the late 1960's. As they evolved they are much more reputable now but have little value in the manner of proving who is the ultimate fighter since there are more rules in an MMA match than there are in many other sports involving combative applications.    MMA is no longer what people think it is and to be honest it has just became the latest fad sport out there. In time it will dwindle like all other sports and end up back in the bars or nightclubs with a small following...especially with people like Dana White involved who is more into the money than anything else.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	People just simply wanted an alternative sport to boxing which only involves upper body strength. So they picked a fighting type that involves martial arts.|`|b0faTDlJaa	well basically pple were getting fed up watching guys jump around and punch each other in the face, aka boxing. They wondered who would win in a REAL fight.

a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Perhaps, but isn't that kind of like asking who the worst player in the Hall of Fame is?  I sure wouldn't mind being the worst player in either group    I'd say Terry Bradshaw is the worst to win 4. Of course, that's only because the other one is Joe Montana. The word "worst" kind of loses all meaning in that context.|`|46Mxaw13aa	for sure.... and bobby brister never actually won 2 superbowls he was just on the team and i hatethat doushebag when i was a kid in 5th grade my dad took me and my brothers down to san diego for the super bowl parties and festivities for kids when the broncos played the packers and we waited outside the hyatt hotel with footballl cards and posters and i saw bobby brister and asked him for his autograph and he said "i dont play football" and i told him i knew who he was and he insisted that wasn't him and he didn't play then 5 min later some hot chick asks him and he signs all her stuff i was just a little kid what a punk....|`|ntLUHiTAaa	dude i pulled for the cardinals but ben played awesome the way he escapes the rush and still is effective on the run. and what tough guy he got sacked like 50 times this season. also in the pocket he is smart accurate and has a cannon for  an arm.|`|jzAAzAbjaa	Yea...he's a good qb. So he has a few bad games... they all do but for some reason everyone is tougher on him then any other qb...maybe because he's so young?|`|uk1e3zajaa	Bart Starr, Bob Griese, Earl Morall,Steve Young and now Big Ben.  He is probably 4th on that list. He played a hell of a game though and shut up may doubters.|`|AA12220784	Yep a 90% plus rating is the worst.  I forgot biased people who are jealous write some of these questions.|`|rC6RD8Wcaa	he is not old will u ask this question if he ends up winning 5? why do so many people think he sucks did you see the throws he made last night? and the time he bought to get those throws?|`|O2jH0yVFaa	Bubby Brister is.|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	he had a better performance than last time|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	Jenn, he did HORRIBLE in the first one but I think ben is o.k, but I dont think he is the WORST.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	He is defiantly better than Trent Dilfer from the 2000 Ravens.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	yep hes up there with tombradybitch|`|tNerdFYsaa	yeah but Dilfer did not win 2...i agree with you on this Rothlisberger is definitly the worst. Without the Steller Pitt D he doesn't sniff the super bowl|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Absolutely not.  He puts his team in a position to win, its not pretty but he gets the job done.  Did you miss the last two minutes of the game?|`|J74Y5LKxaa	He didn't exactly put up championship statistics last night.  And his first Super Bowl win was even worse!  But the Steelers are proof that football is a TEAM sport.  And Payton Manning has proven time and again that you can't do it all on your own as well.|`|ADJH5UNpaa	No.  Jim Kelly was in four straight Super Bowls and did not win one.|`|exOOXAkBaa	Yes, no piece of sh*t QB deserves to win a Superbowl, let alone 2.|`|xQFWjFyZaa	The obvious answer is Tom Brady. He's the definition of a system QB.
U2DJBcNUaa	I met Peyton Manning once at a gas station.  He was really nice, and cool.  We talked about Tony Dungy, and he said that Coach Dungy is a good man.  We also talked about what it is like going to different cities to play different teams.  It was about 1 year before the Colts won the SB.  That was when I met Peyton Manning.|`|kGRkjw6Qaa	I met a couple    I met Brandon Chillar who is a linebacker in the NFL now, I met him when he was still in high school, I was in little league, he gave me some great tips.    My dad used to manage a restaurant in Pittsburgh where some of the Steelers went after games, I met Troy Polomalu, Plexico Burress, Casey Hampton, Clark Haggans, Marshall Faulk and Mike Rozier (1982 Heisman Winner). I also met Larry Fitzgerald when he was still at Pitt. I also became good friends with Larry Foote, he gave me lots of advice throughout high school.    Now I play at Cornell and there are some NFL prospects I played with, but on the sideline at the Columbia game I turned around and met the stomach of Kevin Boothe who went to Cornell last year and plays with the Giants now, He was on the field goal team in the Super Bowl!     But yeah, over the years I have met a few players and it has been an honor to have conversations with them and share football sense. Truly amazing experiences.|`|k1a3o9hSaa	ive met kurt warner, larry fitzgerald and the whole steelers team. i am rich and i pay to meet them.

Darrell Dess was a All Pro Lineman for the NY Giants in the 60's.|`|AA10939368	I met Steve Furness in an area restaurant when I was 13 and asked him for his autograph.  At first he was reluctant suspecting it was for my dad or older brother, he asked me questions regarding his name and number.  I floored him providing much more information than he asked, he laughed and said that any little girl who knew that much about the NFL deserves an autograph.    I also met Terry Bradshaw in our local drugstore, he was as nice as could be.  I was nervous and ran out forgetting to ask him for his autograph.  I was 14 at that time, and he would have given it to me if I requested, but I was too embarrassed.|`|BZpF8nSsaa	I met Jeff Garcia at a 49ers training camp in...i think 2003, he is a classy guy|`|tq5vKKWzaa	I almost got hit by Terna Nande's  GMC Envoy.

Not a football player, but I also saw LeBron James at Cedar Point once|`|ntLUHiTAaa	2 points
j9GokH9Qaa	I think it will be a great match but it was a little too predictable.. Every time Shane returns he always brings a No Holds Barred match but its great though.. Dude Shane's no hold barred matches are always good.. For example, Shane vs Kane in an ambulence match... It was really good.. Randy will get The Legacy involved in the match though.. and maybe finish Shane off for a while..    BQ- Hopefully Jericho|`|86kZ5uYwaa	I think it will be a good one. Just because I think that Orton will punt Shane.     Bq- Jericho|`|o6g6KepGaa	haha shane's 'punches', That was a comical ending to the show.    But seriously, If anything, if these two had a match, Orton would have to really go all out to make the match look half decent.    BQ - Jericho|`|pnsp765saa	Why would Randy be in the chamber.

Its all up to the rest of your team.|`|6c2w8LF1aa	good trade, very good trade.

4JOG5qB1aa	Mike Modano forever.  Why?    He's been dedicated to the Stars organization, and has been a true classy player throughout the years that players can look up to.  He's the best American born player to put skates on, and even at his age, he's still an All-Star.    He was a great captain, a great role model and leader, and still is.  His talent on the ice is magnificent.  Without Modano, Neal wouldn't have such a productive rookie campaign.|`|rpVKnfIdaa	my favorite player in nhl is ovechkin  my favorite player on my team is patrick marleau|`|N1OnviExaa	Daniel Alfredsson.|`|YTwnVAtdaa	well Travis Zajac cuz he is soooo cute! and cuz he is on the Devils and i think he is a great player!    also, i like ovechkin, He is the funniest guy ever!!|`|vSBHPnJ8aa	Steve Sullivan   GO PREDS|`|htxwTAAQaa	Probably between Phil and Zdeno.|`|aLq8tT6Qaa	paul stastny great guy, sick player, and he plays for the avs!|`|Bv0I2aRAaa	Milan Lucic...Top Line Winger who kicks some serious ***...|`|UkW9FPEZaa	Milan Hejduk|`|69xxpTz1aa	cully|`|1il4TENTaa	Brent Seabrook|`|YajYjjxLaa	Mine is Joe Sakic P.S.

apY85Qmtaa	Pro men's boxing and the NBA.    NBA - Since I live in New Zealand I don't have a "hometown" team, so I like to support a number of teams. I like the Bucks, Blazers, Hornets, Spurs, Cavs, Magic, Bobcats and Nuggets. I'm a casual watcher but I do have some LeBron James clothing, a Team USA ball and the Nike Jordan Melo M5 shoes.    Boxing - I'm Filipino so it's only natural for me to root for our boxing hero Manny Pacquiao. He's the reason why I box...to prove that a small person from a small country can take on big opponents, and he proved this by beating Oscar de la Hoya recently.|`|1fGBLJvVaa	um i love gymnastics      whatching it and doing it    i think thats is sorta what ur asking, if not sorry|`|cWyjO8vBaa	i ? cheerleading!  i love it because it is a dangerous sport, also because i am a flyer and that is my ABSOLUTE favorite thing to be thrown up in the air ten feet!  i guess i just love the danger in it,  and i love meeting new people and making new friends!!|`|lg0g6pH7aa	skateboarding!!

yr1hEsa0aa	Ok I'm a Pittsburgh gal and I want to say I agree 110% when you say the football fans are arrogant. They get pissed off when anyone thinks about their beloved terrible towel but will burn other teams jewelers on play it over and over on the local news station. They can't handle a little bit of friendly trash talking. Yes they do have 6 championships but what ever they are still taken things to far.   As for hockey fans, we are just there to have a good time. Win or lose (and we have alot of loses in the last couple months) We may get a little mouthly but we blame that on the 100+ bars near the Arena. About 15-20 with in walking distance.|`|hHXG8ef6aa	yes, they certainly are|`|nQlwiHfLaa	At least their football team has won 2 of the last 4 Super Bowls and lead the NFL with 6 overall SB Championships.    What's so dandy about their hockey club???!!!|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Because they are Loyal More Loyal when their Teams are more successful, I know know some people from Pittsburgh I agree BLACK AND GOLD RULES.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	If you think that's arrogant, do yourself a favour and don't talk to Habs fans.|`|48b84a8f546ab32d894f3370f4eca47faa	This is a city that has won 6 super bowls, 5 World Series, 2 Stanley cups, and has one of the largest fan bases, other then Dallas or Detroit what other city can say that.|`|naZQqrNeaa	I am not really sure what is there to be arrogant about with hockey.  Malkin is doing great.  Pens have not won Cup in over 15 years....so what is there to throw a party about.|`|DbfG5Cpraa	you're the arrogant one, asking this question|`|rU2RSeiCaa	I don't think it's considered arrogant if you just won the SB for the second time in four years.  We're allowed to celebrate too; aren't we?     Besides, I have to get some celebration in my sports life, the Pens aren't doing so hot, and I'll admit it.  I won't tell you they are the best team ever or anything; at this point, I really don't think they deserve to make the playoffs, even with the top two scorers (that's not arrogant, just a fact.).    So, sorry if it comes off that way, but here in Pittsburgh, we feel deep, deep pride when our sports teams accomplish something big; it probably does come off as arrogance sometimes, but, hey, we're not trying to offend anyone, just have fun and celebrate.|`|FEIXGtQyaa	Being arrogant and being happy are two completely different things.    And let me correct the massive amounts of spelling errors in your whole post.  What you should have said is:    "They are so used to there winning ways in both hockey and football. Plus, they always accuse other fans of being arrogant."      Alright, English class is now over! :)|`|N1OnviExaa	Used to their winning ways? They've only been good the past two seasons.    Arrogant, absolutely not.|`|jbTNER3caa	Yes, they definitely are too arrogant.  No offense, but I believe this is mostly because of Sidney Crosby.  He needs to learn to take a hit and not whine about it.  It's hockey, he's gonna get checked.    Having said that, the Penguins got OWNED by the Canadiens last night!!  :D
tJeCEhisaa	Go to Tapco,     http://www.tapco.com/catalog.aspx?id=75    they have numerous SKS add on items which are not for looks only. Many Police departments have actually been modding the SKS rifles (Yugos) and turning them into the carry rifle which many cops now pack in the trunk of their squad car. The 20 round detachable mags from Tapco turn the Yugo into a serious machine. I get 1.5 inch groups with my Yugo using reloads. 2 and 3 inch groups are the norm for a Yugo shooting wolf or Brown Bear etc. This is exceptional for an SKS but for the Yugo which is an all milled rifle. It was the main battle rifle for many countries and is tough as nails. probably the best SKS ever made and is in a leauge all it's own. The Tapco items actually help improve on the Yugo's already awesome attributes.     Hope this helps|`|NN4lnWYEaa	Gather all the info and try www.cheaperthandirt.com|`|b0N9Oh3oaa	Stick with good quality ammunition. High capacity mags are cool if you can find one that feeds well. I bought three 30 round clips and only 1 of them will feed without jamming too much, I'm thinking of putting the stock box magazine back in for reliability. They make aftermarket stocks for them but I like the look of the wood.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	I'd say listen to Dodgeboy and moacez.    Additionally, to make it badass....  Also, check to see if it has cosmoline in it. That stuff will clog up a gun and keep it from working properly. It won't hurt it, but it WILL need to be removed.   http://www.theboxotruth.com/docs/edu23.h...    Make sure that spring and its housing/tube are CLEAN, you want that spring tube so clean your mom would be proud to EAT off it.     Oh, and make sure your grenade selector is in the right place. It should be locking the launcher sight down. Otherwise, you'll be firing bolt-action.|`|43V1pN2Taa	put some lead in clip and thats all you need|`|u4ZxGQgSaa	see how well it shoots now. if it is accurate leave it alone sks's are all over the place as far as bore and chamber dimensions. i've had a yugo and still have my chinese. yogo wouldn't hit the side of a barn if i was standing in it. chinese is a tack driver bone stock. i tried a butler creek stock on the yugo and it got worse|`|tazUGumXaa	Nothing. Not much you can do to improve accuracy. Scopes are not worth much as they mount on top receiver cover and have to be removed for cleaning. Just get stripper clips and lot and lots of ammo.
NvaK57Phaa	you have to be invited to the combine. you have to be ranked in their top 200 in the nation or something like that in order to get one. my cousin (jelani jenkins) is 7th in the nation overall and is the number 1 ranked OLB in the nation.|`|O2jH0yVFaa	You have to get an invitation.|`|kGRkjw6Qaa	I got invited in high school, they sent it to my coach and he gave it to me in school.  But there are other camps that are good. Try looking at the Metro Index Camp or the Adidas skills camp, I can't remember them being free or not, but they are worth it.

u93eagkqaa	Football is not for everyone son... I know 9th graders whom are 6ft 240 so maybe they are just scared for you.    After saying that having a big heart makes up for a lot of missing talent.

jKOB7n35aa	He was actually drafted as a shortstop by the Pirates before he switched to pitching since he wasn't a very good position player. Then he began developing the knuckleball.|`|hR87A418aa	BECAUSE HE A BEAST :)|`|WMJwIRGxaa	Have you ever really seen a knuckleball, up close?    I saw Phil Niekro's knuckleball pitch from behind home plate in St. Louis.  It may be slow, but it has so much movement on it, when done right, that it's extremely difficult to hit.    Of course, nobody has succeeded with a knuckler to the same extent as Niekro.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	He was drafted as a First Baseman...I even remember seeing him in Spring Training down in Bradenton.  He wasn't a very good hitter and apparently was "playing around" with the knuckler during warmups.  One of the coaches pulled him aside and told him he'd have a better shot at the majors with that knuckler than as a hitter.  That coach should have a street named after him in Boston.|`|5BQM1hTTaa	I don't know.  I can't stand his pitching.|`|AA11657414	it's slow, but it moves so much NO ONE.....Wake. hitter, catcher, ump ....knows where its going.....most of the time a called strike, occasionally 400 feet to left center......    and the pitch may be slow, but Wakefield is  SECOND, ALL TIME in numbers of wins by a Red Sox pitcher.....1st place is a tie between someone named Clemens and someone named Cy Young.....|`|gCdvDjfkaa	To every body that is hating on Tim Wakefield...He may pitch slow but the knuckle ball is one of the toughest pitches to throw in baseball and it takes a lot of practice to perfect it and he throws it very well!!!!!!|`|gwUq6HMUaa	He has a knuckle ball that makes guys in the MLB look silly.|`|8qtm4qkUaa	Knuckleballs are slow, but they are notoriously difficult to hit when thrown well.

Ar5VHDiBaa	Because the the Cards lost....... if they would have won the Stealer fans would have found about 10 things to cry about.    It's not against the rules to tackle someone coming from out of bounds........ if it was, what would they do? give him 2 more points..... he scored.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	At one point Fitz was interfered with by a Pittsburgh player that was out too far from the sidelines during that interception play, which is against the rules since you brought it up.|`|RZIV15e3aa	Because Cardinal fans don't know anything about football.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	It's not illegal. Check the rule book again.    It's illegal to touch the ball after going out of bounds ("illegal participation"), but it's NOT illegal to make a clean tackle after going out of bounds.    (edit:) The Troy Edwards play was on kick/punt coverage, for which the out of bounds rules are different.|`|FPjIOlSAaa	uhhh not illegal    just a tackle    not a cardinals fan|`|S71lfad2aa	actually he was pushed out of bounds and then caught up to Harrison and in the process he also ran into the strong safety Wilson.  what else would you do if you got pushed out of bounds would you just stay there and look he had to try to do something.  personally i wouldn't tackle him i would just have pushed him out of bounds.|`|MxHIdyVAaa	us losers?  if this would have been penalized it would have been wiped clean from the record book.  in three months no one will remember this even happened.  why?  IT HAD NO AFFECT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE PLAY!  James Harrison still got the touchdown either way.|`|AA11066475	Because only losers whine.    They ***** about every single penalty, when in fact they commited a million more than actually called. They held Harrison on nearly every play. Oh, and what about Kurt taking his helmet off to argue his first fumble, which they overturned. Thats another penalty    and punt/kick rules are different than standard plays. it actually wasnt illegal, but i heard noise about them adding more rules.|`|mukMu3IHaa	unless u can back it up, I believe that only has to do with touching the ball- AND NOT MAKING A TACKLE on a play down the field.    Show me the Rule     PS- It was basically 17 on 11 last night....the black n white shoulda been wearing blackngold)|`|b7139542d430455d85e3e96c8f1b78c4aa	I think maybe you should actually learn the rule yourself before making a post about an infraction of one.    There was no violation there and it didnt affect the outcome of the game.    However, some of the other infractions that werent called did.  A lot of them went against the Cardinals.    Very poor officiating for a Superbowl crew.    I dont like either team so I could care less but it was one-sided officiating.|`|mFgROIhRaa	What about Lamar Woodleys block in the back. Harrison would have been down at the forty yard line. Also Fitzgeralds tackle was legal.|`|AA11585537	Did you even actually watch the int. return,, the steelers were blocking in the back,, tugging on red jerseys,, holding,etc,   but all you saw was a illegal tackle on a steeler at the goal line  thats funny,, BTW where was the flag on holmes for using the ball as a prop to celebrate a td?  once again pro-steeler refs!|`|To7Pzvg7aa	David E.....wow that's alot of ifs to justify a fantasy come true Cardinals Superbowl win.....face it they lost and the Steelers won !....not the best officiated game but nothing that would change the outcome.|`|94e63c084703cb29e5828b10473c2ba9aa	For all you Card fans without a ring whining about no review at the end of the game.  Here ya go;  http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/28971640/  Now, fly away little birdies and while the ALMIGHTY STEELERS are working on number 7, try to figure out a way to keep your squad together with free agency and make the playoffs next year without Hailey. PS. It is TOTALLY LEGAL to run out of play then come back into play and make a tackle on a regular play NOT RELATED TO THE KICKING GAME. However, it IS NOT LEGAL to make the TACKLE FROM OUT OF BOUNDS. Which in fact, he did. Initial contact was made while Fitzi was still out of play. Doesn't matter anyway, HE SCORED. It's easy to point at the officials. However, I'm sure if you go back and watch the game and "JUST WATCH YOUR O LINE" you'll realize that the only way Kurty stayed in the game, was because the officials can't call holding on EVERY OTHER PLAY. Consider it a gift from the NFL that the red birds were only penalized 106 yards. Coulda been a lot worse. Hey, you coulda been rooting for Lionheart! :-)|`|w2fovw5Zaa	ok first of all its not just fans...espn has been talking about missed calls all day...either way fitzgerald going out of bounds had no outcome of the game he scored it either way....here r some things the refs missed tht espn pulled out    1.Kurt Warner Taking of his helmet aftr the fumble  2.James Harrison should have been ejected after the kidney punch  3.Santonio Holmes celebration after gw TD...could hav added 15 yrds to cardinals drive  4.They hardly reviewed Kurt Warners "fumble" which ESPN also said wasn't a fumble(there was also a penalty on the steelers on tht play  15 yards)    ok but lets look at this, lets see NO santonio holmes penalty  which would have added 15 yards  hardly reviewed fumble  which also had a 15 yd penalty on it...but lets see...the cardinals were at the 49 wen the "fumble" happened, lets see if they call santonio holmes penalty thts 15 yards which puts them on the 34 yard line of the steelers...and if they would have reviewed Kurt Warners, what would have been an incomplete pass, the steelers ALSO had a 15 yrd penalty on tht play, which would hav put the Cardinals on the 19 yrd line of the Steelers which would hav been a VERY easy situation to get fitzgerald a TD, and or boldin or breaston....so wen it all come downs to facts the Cardinals really should hav won tht game    Lets face it, every game has some really bad calls, this one just happened to be the Superbowl and changed the outcome of the game.|`|bLmuhKUgaa	I noticed it too.  It's absolutely retarded, but apparently a player can conveniently run out of bounds, sprint full speed, and pop back in when he jolly well feels like it.  If he was inbounds, obviously he would have easily been blocked.     It makes no sense obviously... whats a team supposed to do, position players out of bonds to block these guys?  Yea that makes sense^^    It's very dirty, but it's not illegal.  HOWEVER, if you look at the play, HE WAS OUT OF BOUND WHILE TACKLING HARRISON.  THATS whats illegal.  Here you can see the play, and here you can clearly see at :37 that Fitz is out of bounds while tackling Harrison:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoxSFBHbA...    Also, to the guy talking about Harrison's "kidney punch (lol?)" it was an open fisted punch on the pads of his back, and then he pushed him twice.  This is football, get over it.   Worse things have been happening all season.  The 15 yard penalty was the right call, that was no reason to kick him out.    THE ONLY call the refs missed was the using the ball as a prop.  But there was no time left on the clock stop crying please!!    GZZ I'm so tired of listening to whining cards fans.
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Notice what the product is referred to as - base layer.  Its meant to go on your skin, because the material is designed to wick away sweat and dry quickly.  Its really good stuff, but typically you want to wear regular running gear (shorts, t-shirt) over top of any of that stuff since its pretty form-fitting.      Also, since it wicks away sweat, you'll want to keep it clean or it will start to smell - I typically rinse mine out and hang it to dry after every use, then actually wash it a couple times each week.    Again let me note to you - its designed as a base layer.  This means you wear it on the very bottom layer - beneath even underwear, right on the skin.  So once more I'll suggest wearing shorts and a t-shirt over it.    Good luck in your upcoming track season.|`|60c1c3cd65f0c9deb7c8cdbb1a06ba1baa	That's fine, but most of us usually wear cotton T-shirts out to practice. Some guys wear the tight UnderArmour stuff as well. But what's more important is the sweats! Our track head coach makes it absolutely MANDATORY to wear sweats out, no matter what the weather be. He says that even though we may feel warm, our muscles could still be cold. We wear the sweats for all of the warm ups, stretching, and drills. We take them off once we begin intervals.|`|NAsrWzEHaa	No, that's great to wear for practices and maybe even under your track uniform for competitions.i wear underarmour all the time and it works great.|`|FIG58FVpaa	That should be fine.     When I ran track everyone just wore plain cotton t-shirts at practice, though.|`|J6xmZqj1aa	That would be awesome, the nike dry-fit type stuff is very highly coveted among distance runners.

In boxing you are allowed to rub vaseline on your fighters face in order to make certain punches slip but we still have knockouts, we still have cuts, we still have bruises. It doesn't do much but maybe make a weak or mistimed punch slip off. But a good puncher can obviously still do serious damage with or without it. Now I know MMA is more grappling than punching like boxing and that vaseline is a slight different story in MMA but it doesn't make a huge difference. You are a little slippery but you still are vulnerable to punches and your opponent can still grab you and vice versa. Also it was done out in the open so there was clearly no intention to cheat. Personally I think it makes no difference as an avid fight fan but I do think it is enough to warrent a rematch. A rematch and a rematch only. No I don't think it should forfeit his win or even close.|`|b0faTDlJaa	Who did Bj think he was, coming up to 170 to fight the pound for pound best UFC fighter to ever grace the octagon. I told every1 Bj would get demolished. Bj looked like a flabby 170 while GSP looked like a 185er.I mean Cmon what did u think was gonna happen. It looked to me like Bj was cheating by turning his head to the side so the only place GSP could strike was the back of the head, and he calles himself a warrior.|`|u93eagkqaa	Not many things can overturn a win, but I don't think it looks well for GSPs corner.    They no the rules why did they feel the need to cheat? I know there's lots of GSP nuthuggers and they think cheating is ok.    Look at baseball with pine tar on the bat or taking HGH none of those things will help you connect a bat to a ball, but it's cheating none the less.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	No. His cornerman needs to be reprimanded though, but the NSAC has stated their is no grounds to overturn the decision.    http://mmajunkie.com/news/13895/kizer-pe...|`|g7xaB57Xaa	I never doubted BJ could pull the upset, he has pulled them before.  But on to your question, I don't think anyone out there can say anything bout whether or not the fight results should be overturned, unless they slowly go back on a recording of the fight and see if there was ever a few seconds when BJ NEEDED to do something with GSP's shoulders.  Of course stand up is a dead give away, and yes that cornerman should never be allowed in the corner again regardless, but you need to go over the entire ground part of the fight and tell me an instance that BJ could have pulled an upset with a better grip on his shoulders.  I personally dont remember an instance that shoulder control would have had the fight end any differently.  If BJ wanted to push GSP off of himself, he wouldn't have had his hands where they were for more than fifty percent of the fight!|`|65PS8shGaa	absolutley not. the fight wasnt even close. bj didnt even try and sweep him he just replaced gaurd and ate elbows|`|1QCWP7FYaa	The fight wasnt close enough to think something little like that would make a difference. Im glad GSP whipped penn like that. I was sick of Bjs talk, and now he looks like the biggest dumb *** in the world right now.      well, maybe besides the guy who let himself get knocked out with 1 second left.|`|MCB1ovEtaa	The win should not be changed but GSP and his whole corner should be disgraced for doing that.     Accident or not honestly i don't give a **** if your a professional you do not let mistakes like that happen.  And from the video clips i've seen it looks pretty intentional, and a little more then a "miniscule" amount as Greg Jackson and Phil Nurse (GSP cornermen) tried to play it off as.
u93eagkqaa	With or without grease?    GSP will run into the same problems BJ did Silva is just too big for him.|`|TH1fT6rdaa	First of all, its GSP, not GRS.    I like GSP, but Silva is bigger and his strikes are better.  Silva isn't necessarily that hard to take down, but actually getting through his punches and knees is nearly impossible.  Dan Henderson was able to take Silva down and control him for most of Round 1, but he tried to do it in Round 2 and got his face punched in.  Also, Henderson took down Silva by a Greco-Roman bodylock, where GSP uses freestyle wrestling.  Attacking Silva's legs is going directly for his ever dangerous knees.  And, Anderson Silva is a BJJ black belt, who can body triangle from the bottom.    GSP does have a prayer, though, if he can out wrestle Silva for 5 rounds and control him on the ground.    I'd give it to Anderson Silva by 2nd or 3rd Round TKO.|`|LXoP4HWNaa	i really hope they do, they are arguably the best 2 fighters in the ufc today. that would be a really good fight, but i think GSP would win by split decision. i dont see a knockout being in that fight. i dont even see a tko being in that, theyre both machines, and as youve seen GSP doesn't get tired|`|0OQ9EdLOaa	to the belief that gsp would win is to say he is the best and i dont know how that could be said. silva is a dominant fighter, and would prove so, odds for the fight would be 6 or 8 to one at best. i am a gsp fan dont make any mistakes about that. but silva would dominant. i dont believe it would go past the 1st round.|`|3g2ng8Ksaa	Anderson Silva would rip that stupid grease monkey!|`|b0faTDlJaa	If Silva comes down to 170 GSP will have the advantage, but if it were opossite Silva would have an advantage. Now if they could meet somewhere in the middle i think the fight would go like this. GSP would be able to empliment where the fight takes place because GSP has world renouned take downs and Silva cant stop from being taken down.AKA weak take down defence. If GSP decides to stand with him well he'd better have a good game plan.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	I don't know that he will.    But he might.    Silva is a beast.  His strikes crush bones and he is fast and unpredictable.    GSP is a beast.  There is no more complete fighter in the world today.  He has no holes in his technique and is a disciplined, highly intelligent athlete.    Both men have superb conditioning.      It is said that all else being equal, the bigger man tends to win.  That would be GSPs dragon to kill.    There is a train wreck coming, guys.  The trains are already moving.  If nothing unexpected happens, we will see this fight in 2010.  Party at my place!

I'm not a steelers fan, but i have a friend who is, and you know what, i'm friends with her because of her personality, not based on the team she roots for    i guess what i'm trying to say is if you want to be shallow, then get rid of her, if you want to actually be a man, then don't.

You'll have a much better life if you dump the Steelers B*** and find someone else. if you live in Cleveland, there are plenty of girls in Cleveland who are hardcore Browns fans. There is nothing wrong with dumping a girl because they are fans of a team you hate. Beleive me, Im a Dolphins fan and I had to deal with the idiotic sheep of Steelers, Patriots, and Bears fans in Chicago.
qB9qn9blaa	Well make sure you have all of your moves down first off like....  1.Keep movements SHARP! Make sure you have all of the moves down especially the high-V!  2.Work your hardest everyday, stretching and getting more flexible.  3.MY try-outs were 2 day.. day one was to learn a chant, cheer and dance and number two was to be tested on them. if this is the same for you WORK YOUR HARDEST on the first day to prove to the coaches that you are determined.  4. Make sure you can at least do a cartwheel.  5.Work on jumps! Jumps are hard at first but when you get them you've got them work on all of your proper form on things like a Russian(toe touch), and all four styles of hurdlers(left and right front, left and right side) It also help to work on the pike which is kinda hard to get down good.

5f4qvGLKaa	I do to, Harrison gets the credit cause of the role he plays in the defense|`|ABoo1doVaa	I think Harrison and Woodley play different positions, and both are great players. In the 3-4, the line backer is going to get more of the glamor stats, and therefore gets more credit. The only reason I give Harrison the edge is because experience.
NvaK57Phaa	it takes speed, skill, definitely agility, jumping ability. also, as a DB, you have to be able to tackle, because very often you have a big tight end running towards you in the middle of the field, or you have a big strong running back running a sweep with two lead blockers right your way. you have to have determination that you WILL no matter what bring down the ball carrier. even if you do not bring him down every time, make up for it on the next play.    you have to have a mental state that nobody is better than you, regardless how big or small you may be compared to someone else. just never quit|`|kGRkjw6Qaa	Good hips, fast (obviously), quick feet, hard hitter you have to be good at changing direction in a small amount of space and time.

dkoGI9nfaa	There is nothing as good as a goal to be successful.  It gives one targets to meat and it keeps one motivated.  Don't just set yourself this one master goal.  Set your self many attainable goals on the way.  Like what time you want to reach at what stage.  Then set your next time goal.  get your whole life organised.  My son did that perfectly.  You do not mention a club or a coach.  you need those if you want to get there.  How many hours are you doing a day?  Do you know whether your style is correct?  Who is going to monitor that and ensure that style is correct.  In the Olympics this is of the utmost importance.  At your age other exercise is not that important but will sure assist you.  Draw up a roster so that you know that you have time for swimming and lots of it, time for school work, television, socialising, work etc.  Yes you can do all these things.  I know as my son did just that and achieved and won.  He did not go to the Olympics as it was not his goal but did win the national championships.  You also need to determine whether you are going to do all strokes or whether you are going to specialise in some or even just one.  Don't be disheartened by disappointments along the way.  Look at you ultimate goal and it there is something in the way, overcome it.  I wish you well.  May you reach your goal.|`|JaK30S94aa	alright, it sounds like you started when you were 15ish, and so i would say that you wouldn't stand a chance of getting into the olympics. sorry.   those guys have been in the pool since they could walk|`|EtWIJrR2aa	im really sorry if icrushed a dream but 16 is way too late to start and hope to become an olypmic contender.     best you could do is probably nationals for your country or youth world champs. but not olympics, sorry|`|qjquVj0daa	Join the school swim team.

7TQ5qGWcaa	So you have Olympic Swimming dreams? GREAT! Not many make it, but if you never try, you never will! The first step is to get swimming. You could join a local swim team with your park and recreation department, school, YMCA, or a USA Swimming club.   Most teams will have different levels based on swimmers ages, skills, and speeds. As you improve, you will advance to keep you challenged - and to keep you improving. Some swim programs specialize in younger or novice level swimmers, then suggest you move to a different team when you reach a certain level. Others are set-up as "cradle-to-grave" programs, offering learn-to-swim, novice competitive, advanced competitive, and masters (adult) lessons or practices.     GOVERNING BODY FOR THE SPORT  USA Swimming is national governing body for swimming in the USA. Fdration Internationale de Natation (FINA) is the international governing body for swimming and they manage swimming at the Olympic games. FINA also writes the rules used in the Olympic Games. Those same stroke rules are followed by USA Swimming.   MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS TO BE ON THE OLYMPIC TEAM  To make the USA Olympic Swimming Team, a swimmer must finish first or second at the USA Swimming Olympic Trials Swim Meet and they must be a US citizen. FINA rules allow a maximum team size of 52 swimmers (26 men and 26 women). Each country has a maximum of two entries in each of 26 individual events (13 men and 13 women) and one entry in each of the six relays (3 men and 3 women).|`|ouvvS1Ylaa	definitely join a USA Swimming or competitive YMCA team.  they work you extremely hard,  and if you have the talent.  they attend large meets and if you qualify,  you can go to junior olympics and eventually the trials.

sPiwb8Hraa	Absolutely yes. He should definately keep playing. He could easily be in another sb.|`|WTQtchbvaa	He should stay with the cards. They have a solid team and he is still a good Qb, unlike Brett Favre|`|Qk3oflwPaa	cash it in & retire. unless it's a 7 figure to stay w/ the cards. if he does then he has a good chance of going back to the SB again.|`|lfcbi9cYaa	First, I think the Cardinal's and Warner were robbed last night.  Bad call, after bad call; I'm not a Steelers or Cardinals fan but how many mistakes can ref's be allowed to make?  I knew the Card's had to play the Steelers but I didn't know they had to play the guy's in black and white too.  Warner's last play was clearly a forward pass.  Even though it was interfered with mid way threw he still managed to get it to land forward.  For comparison purposes, Tom Brady did less/worse in the infamous Snow Bowl against the Raiders back in 01' (I think) and he ended up getting the ball back ( Tuck rule).  Btw, that was the worst call in the history of the NFL.         Anyway, not to get off the subject here but I'm just a little disgusted because Warner deserves that Lombardi.  I see no reason why he should quit now.  At best, if he wants an easy paid check he'll make a great back up if he chooses a lesser role.  However, I don't see the Card's making it to another SB, because 1.) they're too dependant on the pass, which teams will adjust to next season and 2.) they can't run the ball.  Even with Warner leading the offense it won't make a bit of difference if they can't open up holes for there rb's.  If they address their needs on their OL they could make a decent run in the playoffs, especially in their weak division.  But Warner in another SB... well... he has a better chance than Matt Leinart and just about 90% of the other NFL starters out there.|`|925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	I think he should retire.  He's getting too old.|`|tNerdFYsaa	most likey he's going to retire, but anybody could be throwing touchdowns to 4 solid WR's|`|60534ad637bb9eeb3a3f4a6859dbba83aa	No, I say he retires now. After such a tough career, it is important to end on a high note, and ending with a Super Bowl appearance is pretty high up the ladder

If they are questioning you being far away form home, and they bring up the bullshit statement, "suppose you get hurt while you're there, and bla bla bla," then tell them that they should stop bringing up hypothetical situations and let you go because Whistler is the ski resort dream.     Tell them how much you love the sport, and what it means to you. Let them know what they will be taking away if they don't let you go. Tell them that you have a lust for adventure and exploration, and discovery. Then let them know that they are depriving you of life itself if they don't let you go.

WnQ3fhVhaa	I can only speak as a woman that plays . I do play co ed So I do have some experience here .   1) Fans should love to see it. I am not sure why they would not . Women have skill and we can play flashy and tough . As well as fun to watch   2) The answer to this is yes. Despite what some think. I being 5 5 and 150 have been checked by guys that are 6 3 250 and no ill effects. They don't let up on me as I am just another player. Not every girl can take that for sure. But there are some that can .  3)This is where it gets tricky. Pretty much any player I think would be very hesitant to Drop the gloves with a girls for sure. But I also know a few girls who have full on punched male players without a thought. So this is about the one one major sticking point.   4)I think you would most likely see a woman as a Goalie first , then as a forward . Way before you would see them as a defnseman. But there are some that could be in any position. No bias . There are talented women out there and coming up. So you never know  EDIT Haley. Women play much more dirty them men since we can't legaly check. in a woman's game. Some women I have played against are pretty viscious with stick work. Honestly I would much rather be checked .  I have also been on the ice when chicks have fought as well as been on the ice when guys have fought. Have seen a girl full on puch a guy in the face as well . I have only heard one player I have ever played with say anything sexist to my face . But When I am on the ice i play as a hockey player , not a chick hockey player. There is no differeence. Us ladies have been petitioning the IIHF for years to allow checking . They have so far not listened to us. I feel that most of what the guys who say women should not be allowed is bad old time stereotypes . Taught by men who didn't know any better.  They are a bit fearful in the backs of thier minds that maybe there is a girl that is better then them and can actully beat them . Girls like me fight very hard to get where we are and get what we should have and deserve. Only fools and people who don't know any better try to stand in the way. I know I am as good as any guy. I have worked my *** of to prove it and have . There are some I won't be better than , but many I am better than. It just sucks that someone like me will not get the chance to do what I love as a pro due to someone elses stupidity from ages ago . Also yes if a chick was involved in just being a typical hockey player in the NHL she would be making the sport front page news . Which is  is a good thing for the sport. I would love to have that chance for sure.  Homes. I am willing to throw punches if I must . I will always stand up for myslef. Any woman that would get to play at that level would be used to some of the crap that would be said. So that kind of proving herself would not be a huge issue. I personally am will to throw down . I feel I have to . Right now I do . I would win as well. I always stand up for myself . And I alwasy will. I will NOT stop until I get where I am going period. But I am a cute D and Foward woman  And still very much a woamn. at that .  Bob : I am glad the Current College level D1 players that I have palyed with and against don't feel that way. Male and female. I am also gald the current Olympian I have skated with and against doesn't feel that way. I am also gald the several Ex NHL players I have played with and against don't feel that way. You are missing out. You are welcome to help out my team if you come down here to Fla any time . We don't descriminate .|`|axxQzOCHaa	1) Women fans would truly identify with and it would help increase participation and their overall fanhood. Casual women fans might become players themselves after seeing one of their own make it to that level.    2) I believe so, but as women are generally shorter and lighter they might be able to elude a hip check.    3) I really don't know.    4) If they're good enough - why not ?|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Cripes, I played in a co-ed league (no minimum women requirements) a few years back, and holy smokes...plenty of self-righteous bullcrap; off the record, it made guys miserable.  If you initiate any kind of body contact, then you're the worst human being ever.  Of course, this one young lady took full advantage (deliberately caused at least four injuries and "accidentally" dropped a knee on the back of my mask giving me a pretty good "bell ringer").    What I did respect is the women on our team that went out, played their game, and made it known that "treat me just like anyone else", and backed it up (but that took a lot of time and yeah...she got knocked on her keester more than a few times).    Women can play.  Hayley Wickenhauser played in a mens league in (I think) Italy, and held her own.  She's the rare exception.    I do think the IIHF needs to allow women at the U-21 and senior (adult) levels to play full check in their games (including Olympics), and if they want to wear visors...let them (again, if men can play with visors or without, there's no reason why women shouldn't be able to choose to wear a visor).    In a non-contact sport like golf, look at the freak show that came out when Michelle Wie was playing in mens events.  Do you really want hockey to become that?  I know...it'll drive ticket sales and tv ratings, but at what cost long-term?    There's no way a male hockey player is going to fight a woman.  If he loses...he's done.  If he wins...can you imagine the outrage that would come?    The fact remains that there is still this inherent sexism that exists in parts of society wherein people are not comfortable seeing a woman on the receiving end of foul treatment by a male.  This is not hockey-centric.|`|m6lDXAmoaa	1. I would enjoy seeing it. I think it would be interesting to see if they could outperform some of the guys. But I don't think it would fly with a lot of the traditionalists who watch the game    2. I think so. I mean, Datsyuk took down Chara and he's what, 5'11? Body checking is a science. People like Phanuef, Kronwall, and Chara know how to check people properly and people like Gretzky knew how to roll off a check or avoid it altogether. If women can learn that stuff, then absolutely    3. I don't think that any guy in the league is going to fight a chick. A lot of it is the mentality of don't hit girls pounded into us by teachers and parents. Another part of that reasoning though is, what if the girl kicks his ***. Could you imagine what George Laraques would do if he got taken out by a woman?     4. Once again, I think it would be a good idea, but a lot of hockey fans probably wouldn't be interested in the notion.     Sorry if number 3 sounded insulting at all|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	NO. Considering I would rather watch a Boy's High School team play than watch women play....no offence but women's calibre is poor.     Of course not and anyone whoo thinks differently is not thinking straight.     No, they would not fight a girl, nor would they ever have to......that is why sports have Mens and Womens....would it be fair in running 100M, boxing, tennis???      No, they shouldn't even be there as goalies.                       Kimmie- They don't even have "co-ed" in these parts......because women would just get in the way! There isn't a woman out there that would last 10 seconds. I wouldn't even play pond hockey with you.|`|G33E41IBaa	1.) I think so.  In the last winter Olympics, women's hockey was one of the most looked-up sports on the Olympic website, and men's hockey was pretty low on that list.  It was no where close to the amount of hits the women's hockey page got.    2.) It depends how they're built.  I know I'm pretty small, so I would probably die haha.  But if the woman's big and strong, I think they can take it.  Brian Gionta's 5' 7" and he gets plastered all the time, but he's a pretty strong muscular-wise, so he can take it.  But for the most part, I think women would get crushed.    3.) I don't think the guys would fight a female player.  I think the players would back off from fighting a woman, which I think is unfair. Of course, beating up a girl is very unacceptable in our culture, but if women want to make it to the NHL, they should be treated just like any other player.  But I think guys want to have class and back away from fighting a girl.    4.) As long as they're good enough, and can withstand the toughness of NHL hockey, then I'm all for it.|`|htxwTAAQaa	I'm as much a proponent of feminism as many of my other fellows, but women should not play in the same sport as men.  Call me old fashioned if you like.    Not a problem, my dear.|`|UoUaO52taa	There's a reason coed pee wee hopckey leagues divide them at 13. I tthink people would enjoy seeing women players b/ of the novelty but the last 2 make it impossible    Like the WNBA. Do I believe Candace Parker is better than some NBA players, Yeah. Do I believe she would be able to play in the NBA. No|`|4JOG5qB1aa	I don't want to really answer your questions because in my opinion, the first three are worthless with my answer in the fourth one.    No.    Why should women be allowed? It's proven they have physical limitations competing against men.  They don't have the toughness, it would take out the intensity in the game because men would have to be a bit softer.  No one wants to see that.    Women can't compete with men in a physical game like Hockey... especially at the professional level.    I don't even think this is a debate.|`|UADHt07Zaa	If they can play well enough for the NHL, I don't see why not.    1) I think some fans would enjoy it more if there were naked chicks playing forward or defensemen.  It would probably take some time to get used to before they would be accepted by fans.    2) Is anyone really capable of being checked by Zdeno Chara?    3) I don't think anyone would start a fight with them but I think if they were put in a situation like that they would have to fight.    4) See top answer.|`|hX089rlnaa	First to answer your questions:  1) I don't think so  2) No  3) No  4) I'd have to say no    The bottom line, like it or not, is no self respecting sports fan (interpret - guy) would really want to see women playing in a mens sport, Hockey or otherwise. And since it's ultimately the fans that drive a sport, I don't see it ever happening outside of an occasional gimmick.    I know I'll geta bunch of thumbs down for this answer, but those people than can be honest and not try to say the nouveau PC answer will know that I am right. Beyond the cultural reasons, there are real physical reasons for this fact. Blame it on the Testosterone.    Even in a non-physical game like golf it has been shown that women can't compete on the same level as men - just ask Anika Sorenstam.    Kimmy - kudos for your tenacity, but let's step back and look at reality. A large majority of MEN can't even play at the NHL level, how do you expect a woman to do so? It's no one's fault, (although I'm sure a lot of women would like to blame it on men) it's just biology and physics. As I stated above, even in less physical games like golf and tennis men and women play at different levels. Believe me, if it could really work, it would have already been done.    And sure there are some bad old time stereotypes involved too. I just know as a sports fan, if I'm going to pay top dollar I want to see the BEST, not some EOEC version.|`|IZ4GcYgiaa	1. As long as the women are wearing short skirts and no fat chicks at least the men will be happy no matter what position the women play. Sad but true how shallow our society can be!    2. I think that depends on how long the men on the ice go without having sex!    3. See   2    4. I think women should be in the NHL as refs! They do it in the NBA!|`|1cde960f92f3cf52ea9b7b2bff72b659aa	I don't want to see women in the NHL point final. Not in the game itself anyhow.  I'm tired of this equal opportunity thing.  There are things women do better and things men do better. Not saying all men are better at hockey than females, but The NHL would not be the same with women playing the game. They guys would be tip toeing around the ice, around the female players. What normal guy could check a girl and feel right about it?! It would change the whole dynamics of the game.    BIG FAT NO!!|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	1) Yes, it would be entertaining, but it would ruin the game because the answers to the other 3 questions is noooooooooo!    2) Not a change.. There would be serious injuries every day, and hitting would eventually be outlawed. Consequently, it wouldn't be hockey. Thus, no hockey fans, and no money.    3) No, North America wouldn't even pay attention to the games anymore, because Gary Bettman would remove touching from the game.    4) PLEASE NO! I'll watch the Women's league, but NOT in the NHL!|`|wKG39U0aaa	I hope my comments don't sound sexist, but I don't think female hockey players belong in the same league as male players.   Apart from the rare elite female player, I definitely don't think women can generally compete with males in such physically demanding sports. Not their fault though, as its a physical and genetic advantage for the males.   If there was to be 1 female to play in the league as a consistent member, she would definitely be in the spotlight for along time and ridiculed by many, which adds extra pressure on her to excel or else face a demotion by her respective team.  I also think plenty of people would enjoy seeing a female play in maybe an exhibition game, but kind of similar to how they might enjoy seeing a 12 year old in the NHL. Interesting at first, but interest dies out quickly if she doesn't succeed.|`|AA11674745	Ooh, ooh, ooh, not much thought. My kind of question.    No, I would not like it because the gentleman in some guys would have them pull up before a bone crushing check. Chivalry has no place in hockey. And if some babe were to high stick me, look out, I'm getting in a good crosscheck.    Uh, wait a minute, I'm a goalie, uh, okay I suppose it would be okay if a chick scored on me.....    In all seriousness, I don't feel that the mixing of genders in a contact sport is fair to anyone from the players to the fans. A dedicated league is the best way to go. The changes involved with incorporating mixed sexes in hockey would turn me completely off to the game. They are close to losing me now and I can't stomach more changes based on their track record.    As for a woman's league surviving on it's own, I'd doubt that too. But I wish it were otherwise because as long as that's the case, there will be women clamoring for a chance to play among men. I'm not against women playing hockey, I'm just against the idea of hockey becoming tennis.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	1) Some woman fans would be proud, but the rest would want them to stick to being Ice Girls to be leered at.  2) Would they survive the check is a better question. Most guys get laid out by him, let alone a woman.    3)  No.  I just had a visual of Chara putting his hand on top of the chick's helmet, laughing,  and holding her back while she's swinging away, like my dad used to do to me when I was 5 and tried to punch him.    Now, someone like Avery would do it and not care because he only fights other players smaller than him. Think of the trash talk in that one:  Avery: I **thump** told you **whap** UGG's **bop** weren't in **pound** style this season ** biff**  OWWWWWWWW *( she kicked him in the nads)*    4) No, because any woman who is big enough to handle it will probably wind up in the WNBA anyway.|`|5UIsGjxCaa	Dropping all chauvinism aside for the time being I will answer the questions and then comment on the concept.    1. Hockey fans enjoy the game as it is played whether the players are men, women or other.    2. I've known some women (in the truly platonic sense) that could handle anything thrown at them. They could handle body checking shot blocking and all else that hockey entails.    3. Only if she beat them up. The goons wouldn't fight her unless she were there size and then it wouldn't matter. Unless she had a moustache like Parros.     4. If they had the ability the answer is yes.    Now for the other part. Chauvinism in full force.  Since NHL players are in the 18-36 year old group. The thought of pregnancy rears its head. During certain stages of pregnancy the foetus can be at risk due to excess physical activity such as body contact and shot blocking. How would a coach or general manager handle this situation? What about salary cap and roster sizes? Would a player who is preggers be considered a healthy scratch? And what about that occasional session when reason and sanity gives way to the effects of the moon? Could a player be placed on the Injury Reserve List due to monthly fluxes? (I'm presently reading a novel set in ancient Rome and my language is affected).    Just some thoughts,  Love and Peace,  Tom

Back stroke is similar but with your face up, laying on your back in the water. bring your arms up alternately in an arch motion from your waist to your head. Keeping arms straight reach again for the far side of the pool. When arm enters water, scoop water to propel self. Kick is the same at the crawl.|`|6kEKTjKiaa	Jesus Christ just type it into Google!!

Wu0XyNspaa	Well, I'll try explaining this in sign language letters, haha.    Usually, the traditional way to serve a volleyball is to have your hand open (like your going to do a high five), or closed (like a sign language 'b', but with your thumb to the side and your hand slightly cupped).    If you still don't have enough power, I let my girls do a fist.  Although, the first would look like a sign language 'a'.  This is not traditional and may not be accepted by most coaches.  Although my former coach and I still teach this method, as one of our players/teammate had a very consistent serve like this.  Make sure that you're still hitting the volleyball with the heel of your hand, but it will inadvertently hit your fingers as well.  Just make sure that your fist has a flat surface between the heel and knuckles.|`|6205283364bce5bf761e31dbab2a3426aa	You could do that but then you have the possibility of it hitting your knuckles  &&  try snapping your wrist nd floowing through have your coach help you|`|FFh7x8a1aa	try hitting the ball against the wall from many different distances. hit it as hard as you can until you get more strength in your arms. that's what i did and now i'm the best server on the team =)|`|4pZVxLx9aa	I'm sorry about your serving luck, but I had the same problem. For me, I could never hit it hard enough either. Try practicing into a wall, and don't hit it with your heel of your hand, but hit it with the center of your palm. It helped me to throw the volleyball up instead of setting it into my hand and tossing. Try some different techniques to getting the ball to where you can hit it.    You know how you spike a volleyball? Or how you (may) bounce the volleyball into the ground just for fun and you hit it with your palm? That's exactly how you serve... like I said, practice into a wall, and try to hit it higher each time. I think if you get a feel for where your hand should be then you will be fine. For me, once I got it, I found that only a brisk movement of my hand would send the volleyball far, so you don't need to be powerful. You just need to know how to hit it and with what part of your hand.    Good luck!!|`|b0CvSEX0aa	open up your hand- you don't want your knuckles getting in the way.  when you go to hit it, use your entire body.  when i was learning, my problem was in my hips.  you need to twist them as you swing your arm.  this will give you that little bit more power you need.  keep working- it will get easier i swear :)|`|wmobPrUnaa	You are supposed to make the hand you are most comfortable with into a fist.  Hold the ball in the other hand.  Either step right leg first or left leg first.  Then step your next leg and then bring your serving hang back.  The step your leg that you steped with first and then bring your serving hand forward and hit the ball.|`|ElCMIUk1aa	make sure your holding the ball out and throwing it up a good distance in front of you i had to help a lot of jv kids learn how to serve that seemed to be their biggest problem its better to hit it with the hard surface right beneth your fingers you dont want to use your whole palm|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	Easiest way to overhand serve:If ur right handed put the ball in ur left hand, and put ur right hand on the top of the , then pull ur right arm back a little, then throw the ball up a little higher than ur head,and while that happens put ur right hand/arm up, then when the ball gets to eye lvl.  Underhand serve:Put the ball in ur left hand if u r right handed and ball ur right hand up into a fist, then swing ur fist back a little, and swing ur fist forward while stepping forward.|`|NYrEP8Ceaa	we use this little phrase when we teach the younger kids.   shelf arm, bow, pop & go.

I ended up getting the Gamma Progression ST a few years ago, and it ends up paying for itself.  It did cost 600 bucks though.  You get what you pay for... I would recommend getting a crank system rather than the cheaper drop weight variety.  If you are on a budget, I would consider buying an Eagnas machine.  If you want better quality get a Gamma machine - they are very sturdy.  Good luck!

xOReEw6Waa	Check your state hunting regulations, a lot of states do not allow ANY firearm with you when you are bow hunting. Just double check with the folks who know for your state. Would hate to lose the privilege of hunting for having a pistol when you shouldn't. I do understand the want of having a dispatch shot, but ....|`|2esGKO2Caa	Better check the laws where you are hunting my friend cause most states it's against the law to carry a hand gun while bow hunting.|`|43V1pN2Taa	i always take my 357|`|TvARYVRJaa	none it is  against the law|`|Hb3IrJ85aa	A 357 is a good choice, you can load heavy or light, what is your reason for carrying a side arm ?|`|kY3uuTq9aa	I like to carry my 357 mag. protects from many different threats. (except bears)|`|xtdeTwYmaa	50 .cal or just a glock|`|HhECyibGaa	It depends on what the biggest threat is where you hunt.  In AK I'd take nothing less than a 475 Linebaugh.  If there are wild piggies about a 41 mag would be good.  For all others a .357 Mag is a good choice.|`|j1s8SNgaaa	I would go with a .357 mag, but check your local regulations first. The .357 loaded with the right loads can be a good defense gun against black bear, or mountain lions, but it's probably not something to be trusting your life with in grizzly country if you wound and anger a big bear.  If your local laws do permit the carrying of a handgun while bowhunting, I would go for it because you never know when you'll encounter a dangerous animal in the bush.|`|ae2mgmcOaa	I believe that it is legal to carry a pistol with you while bow hunting, but only when you are bow hunting bear.     And i believe the best and most sensible to take would be a .44 mag, it will be enough to take down a charging bear with proper shot placement. Also more often then not just the sound of the shot would be enough to scare them off.

ocHNtbQZaa	Football is mostly about acceleration. Just get stronger and run short top speed sprints. Running speed is determined almost entirely by the ability to apply muscle support force into the ground so you don't collapse at the ankle/knee at ground contact. The result is shorter ground contact times and faster speed. Try leg presses where you lift the weight with both legs but hold in place with one leg, on ball of foot, knee slightly bent. Hold as much weight as you can for 10-20 seconds. Do 3-6 holds on each leg once or twice a week. One legged iso wall squats are also good. Work up to 1 minute holds with upper leg parallel to the floor.  As you get stronger hold weights. Also run short sprints to apply the strength faster and practice relaxation while running.|`|AA10241450	I would say do lots of short sprints such as 50 and 100 meter dashes.  Also buy Terrill Owen bodylastic resistance bands or kinetic bands to practice your running drills.  The bands will give you an extra spring in your step and will help condition your muscles better than weights.  Also practice hill runs do short runs of up to 40 to 200 meters.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	To get fast, you have to train fast. 100meters  repeats at 95%-100% effort, with full recovery

It can't be Drew Brees , who came 16 yards short of breaking Dan Marino's record in yards. It can't be Super Bowl QB Kurt Warner. He did to good  in Super Bowl  to be considered the Worst. So by default it has to be Jeff Garcia. Why would you think it's Kurt Warner? He is the only starting QB in the division who got to the Super Bowl with two teams.|`|uXiKfK0Yaa	Chris Redman worst ( my oppinion)    j. delhomme...went the farthest|`|4uSRVZNNaa	jeff garcia or whoever is the quarterback du jour for tampa bay.|`|xP08melDaa	Its Jeff Garcia/ Jake Delhomme there both overrated....

It would not surprise me if he is very depressed because of that. I mean the olympics have been going on for 150 years and no one has ever done what he just did. How do you repeat that?    Now I am not making excuses for him he is in a role model position and his work ethic alone makes him a role model however, the only true role models for kids are superheros and they are only 2D    everyone makes mistakes it is just those that become super successful at younger than 20 that are not allowed to make mistakes without the hordes of paparazzi following you around.

tvuhGTD9aa	It's more a stat for pitchers than hitters, and was developed by Voros McCracken about five, ten years ago. BABIP numbers support the theory that pitchers have the most influence over strikeouts, walks, and home runs, and outcomes on everything else -- balls in play -- depends a lot upon his defense behind him. So far the data has been reliable, with a slight bias seen for knuckleball pitchers (which may be real or a small sample size illusion, since there are so few of them).    You can (and should) search for more on the Web rather than rely upon YA responses. This isn't much, but here's BP's definition: http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossa...|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Probably, how many times you bat to how many times you put the ball in play.|`|8skV9ze9aa	(H-HR)/(AB-K-HR)+sac flies    Its purpose is to see how lucky pitchers are. League average is about .290 BABIP. If batters have a BABIP significantly above .290 against a pitcher, that means the pitcher has been unlucky, and if it's significantly under, then he's been lucky.     People try to apply it to batters to see which ones have been lucky or unlucky but it's kinda stupid because different kinds of hitters will have different BABIPs. Fly ball hitters will have BABIPs much lower than .290, ground ball hitters will have BABIPs a bit higher than .290 (especially speedy ones since they can beat out infield hits), and line drive hitters will have BABIPs much higher than average. Ichiro, a speedy GB/LD hitter, has a career BABIP of .356.

JWu1exdQaa	You look to the right because you need to look at your first base coach to see what they do.    You run to second base after you touch first and IF your 1st base coach motions you to go to second.    Have fun playing softball! :-D|`|noBXX7pEaa	usually you look right because that is where your first base coach should be. they are usually the ones telling you to keep going on to second because they can see where the ball is.    and you continue to the second base if you hit the ball far out enough and you know that you can make it there in time before your opponent on second base gets the ball.|`|d8e728311057920726dbfbc7353ca59faa	You are tought to look to the right because if the ball gets past the first baseman then you can judge weather to go or not. Or the coach says. You go if the ball gets past the first basemen, into the outfield ( depends ) or the coach tells you.|`|RsTm8uUlaa	I think I understand what you're asking, but I'm not 100% on exactly what you're asking. I think you're asking why do you look right towards the coach while running to first. This is because they're going to tell you whether to run to second or to stop.    You'll run to second base when the first base coach tells you to, or if you know you can make it. You must look up to pick up what the coach is telling you to do. It's a lot easier for the coaches to see where the ball is than for you to. Just do what they tell you.    When you're running to second you'll look to your left and pick up the third base coach. They'll tell you to stop on the base, round the base, slide into the base, or to run to third. They'll also tell you what to do once you reach third.    The third base coach also tells you what to do when you're on first base by giving you signs. Each time has their own set of signs. My team has 3 sets of signs that we use at different times. We have 3 signs for each thing such as steal.    If you need any other help, e-mail me.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	1st Question: I think you got it wrong. As soon as you HIT the ball you turn right and head for first.  2nd Question:When your first-base coach tells you to, or soon you will build an instinct to whether you should go or not!|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	You will learn all about these things when you play...there will usually be a first base coach, who will tell you when to run...have fun!!!!!
1MOqg0yzaa	first you should get a really cheap one from Walmart and use it for about 3 months, then buy a good one.|`|E8go0osDaa	The best place to start is by getting the packaged, pre-made ones you can get at wal-mart or even a sports exchange store.    After you get better, you can go to a skate shop and get your own customized board.|`|fPL7Ftjtaa	this will help u in so many ways 1. make friends with a skater  2.watch some skate vids. (youtube fule TV) 3.go to a skate shop and have an employ help u get a board|`|15ab66e1b13b08c6b65cd904cd8f8639aa	Dont listen to that fool, DONT buy a Walmart board, they suck and you might get used to those in the long run. I suggest you go buy a pre made complete at your skate shop, or just ask the workers there to help you choose one for you. Just DONT buy a wally board....|`|oqiH3fCCaa	The Wallmart boards are terrible. I wouldn't recommend buying one. But if you don't want to spend much money you should see if you can buy a blank board. They are usually much cheaper but aren't made of 2X4 like the ones with dinosaurs at Target. Plus, I honestly like them more because even if they might not be quite as good as a pro deck, if you are an artist at all you can decorate it with your own personal design.
4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Yeah i wish shawn would just kick his head off because this storyline is getting too boring and too old. We all know there might be a match between them at wrestlemania so we can expect that he'll kick him sometime between No way out and wrestlemania. I say that HBK deserves another title shot after beating JBL.|`|uiRkBwa9aa	JBL is a rich moron. in his spare time he likes to suck pnus  a q p      w|`|o6g6KepGaa	Who knows .... But hopefully because this little storyline thing is getting annoying, imo it needs wrapping up now.|`|JiJwxr1taa	I sure as hell hope so.|`|7rpILeYtaa	Wrestlemania.    at No Way Out they will be in a match against each other, but the storyline wont end there, the storyline will end at Wrestlemania|`|fmUGHvgHaa	well jbl is not in the champer match because of hbk loose to cena.. so probably jbl will fire hbk today and hbk will kick jbl|`|c0b843402c3ee206a8f4d1dc3949a130aa	I HOPE SO...  JBL SUCKSSS!!!  Nd Dat Gimmick Is SOOOO  S,T.U.P.I.D.!|`|pnsp765saa	I hope so because I want Shawn to do the things he use to do like once again main event Mania|`|caczNImxaa	i think it will be at wrestlemania,but the sooner the better
KmMRHKTNaa	Raul Gonzales Blanco aka " el numero ciete" which means the number 7. great player i have tons of respect for raul as a barcelona fan.|`|JiKNOtvdaa	It's Raul|`|3ZrTiVFCaa	Ral (Ral Gonzlez Blanco)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_G...|`|c6H2GC9kaa	i think its raul|`|5vmpBbJwaa	Raul|`|B5tP2x3Naa	Its EL Capitano Raul Gonzales Blanco Garcia :D|`|zYVHWlo8aa	Yes its Raul( The King Of Real Madrid FC)|`|eWKG1gCPaa	it is raul|`|IOKilPsFaa	its raul..   definitely one of the best striker in the world
JEMtVVkBaa	parents can not always get to the tournaments.    Djockvic's family was not there either this year because they were busy back in Serbia.     Players parents also have jobs (believe it or not considering how much these guys get) and their own personal lives too.|`|lkA2L59Gaa	Roger's parents weren't there at the match
sPiwb8Hraa	The Ravens are a fine professional football team but they shouldn't brandish threats, which detracts from their professionalism and makes people not like them. I'm a Steelers fan, and I would not tolerate any players on the Steelers threatening other NFL players I would complain to my team.|`|O2jH0yVFaa	I'm mutual about the Ravens I don't hate them nor do I like them.|`|xP08melDaa	I like em.. At first i was rooting for them in the playoffs (till they lost)  My favorite player on that team is ED REED.... He's so intimidating|`|60534ad637bb9eeb3a3f4a6859dbba83aa	Well they knocked my Fins out of the playoffs...so no|`|nr6KBe8Naa	*barf* yuck!!! GO STEELERS!!!!!!!!!! 6 TIME SUPERBOWL CHAMPS!!!! WELCOME TO SIX-BURGH!!! HEy...HOW MANY SUPERBOWLS HAVE YOU WON?|`|3XUuxALyaa	yes. they are one of my fav teams. along with the jacksonville jags. pity they didnt make it the whole 9 yards. great they made the AFC playoffs though. would have killed the cards if they had of made it in
468e5cy8aa	A hybrid bike fits your needs. They are more rugged than road bikes and perform reasonably on the roads. Their slightly wider tires are less prone to flats. The riding position is more upright than a racing style bike which you would find more comfortable. The frames usually have eyelets for racks if you want to carry stuff. Hybrids typically have mountain type gear ratios, helpful to make your way up hills, especially if you're carrying stuff you bought on the errands.    HTH|`|xnBbmCkCaa	That depends on your personal preference. If you want to go faster, than get a road bike with thinner tires. If you want to ride on sidewalks, though, i'd get a mountain bike.|`|NcwD9XSHaa	Medium wide tires, fenders, and a luggage rack.  Multi gears but there is no need for more than 6 or 7.  Helmets, locks, and maybe portable lights.|`|Fx5BENIxaa	any used steel road bike would be perfect. there efficient, strong, long lasting, and most of all cheap. if you want to carry stuff look into racks, panniers, and trailers.    start checking out craiglist and your local bike shops|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Go o the local bike shop and look at hybrid bikes.  They will have the thinner more efficient tires like a road bike but have a more comfortable upright seating position.  Look at Trek, Specialized, Raleigh, Fuji, Giant, Cannondale, and a few others.  Here are some examples.    http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-us/bike...  http://www.fujibikes.com/LifeStyle/City/...  http://www.raleighusa.com/bikes/hybrid/r...    Forge has a line of less expensive bikes but they require assembly and can only be mail ordered. They are better then anything you can find at Wakmart or department store.     http://www.forgebikes.com/road.asp|`|MwDRb7GLaa	While hybrid bikes are nice, I recommend comfort bikes for those who have been away from a bike for awhile. They are designed to be super easy to ride and very comfortable. If you have a little more experience then commuter bikes are great.|`|8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	For that sort of riding, I keep a garbage picked beater in the garage.  That way I don't have to be concerned about theft or vandalism.  Type and brand has varied over the years.  When I snap the frame or wear out an expensive part, I pitch it and find another one.     I put most of my miles on a mid-range mountain bike.  Commuting on roads and rails to trails account for most of this, with occasional single track forays.    For all-road trips or racing I have a higher end triathlon bike.|`|kZO68ex4aa	Bob A  makes a great point. Take a look at Forge Bikes, I have the M Street (matte black). Forge makes quality bike shop bikes. The M street is all aluminum, SRAM gears, fender mounts if you ever decide on fenders. Order on target.com, AAA members get 10%....     http://www.forgebikes.com/mstreetbk.asp   http://www.forgebikes.com/mstreetblu.asp
b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	Find out what size you need by visiting a local shop and then you can search online for closeout items.  If you can pick up last years Alpine Stars at a cheap price they are worth the money and I know they have a few more colours in the range this year so may well want to get rid of last years models cheap.  The tech 10's are great but expensive so you could look at the tech 8s also a good boot but not quite as expensive.    Fox are okay if you like them, but Thor are not really all that good in a mx boot.|`|W4BvABL6aa	If you are not a nutty whatty that has to have the latest model .... Get a close out or last year model from a mail order. Search the Web... Or if you know friends at a local shop that will order through their business. They can help.|`|qM4cMNufaa	ebay|`|dcDRHNDQaa	The internet or your local mx shop, just get last years model boots or something. That goes with all the gear you get.|`|WIsKyL1Maa	Try bidbymotorsports.com they have good prices on boots and motocross gear. Good luck
mAtUgT8naa	the suspect is by far the best ski out of all of those|`|DhEZj9cKaa	how about the salomon poopy puffs|`|DD5Gsqx4aa	Line is the best brand all the way. Just look at all the features provided in the line Invader! 8 different features that make this ski a beast in the park: 4D fibercap, Butter Zones (greatest invention that will improve the way you butter tremendously), Carbon Ollieband (for extra pop onto rails higher than you think you can), Maple Macroblock Core (made of high quality, lightweight, long-lasting, durable wood), a fatty base and edge (to resist impact and add to the already incredible durability of the ski, and tune your ski many more times), center mount (you probably know what it is but just in case: the binding is mounted in the exact center of the ski, and the ski has equal length on both sides so you ride backwards and forwards the same way with the balance you desire), symmetric flex (enhancing the experience of riding backwards making it the same as riding forwards), and finally, symmetric geometry (which means the ski is the same shape in front and behind the boot, and speaking of geometry I have to to my homework and shouldn't even be on here but w/e). Overall this thing is a jib-monster. Take it on any c-rail, s-rail, rainbow rail, kink rail, box, table, kicker, wall ride, or any other feature you can think of. This ski will take a beating. Like literally you can take it to urban rails in parking lots and lank on concrete with the slightest amount of snow and the ski is so durable it wont be damaged. Its like the ski is saying "Jib everything in sight, please!!!" Its so light, too so its good for switch ups on rails and boxes so rather than doing your 180 on and a 360 off, you can do a 360 on, a switch up or two, and then your 360 off. Its also great for nose and tail presses. You name it, any trick and you'll be able to do it quicker because the ski is so much lighter. So definitely check out the invader. The best place to look would be here:  http://www.lineskis.com/product/invader  Good luck...have an epic season...
qtaT9E3paa	Well they basically do the same thing in a check up,but the wired aprt for girls is they make you bend over wit your pants off just to check your joints in your knees or sumthin like that,but i aint bad you shoudl get one its' worth it just dont ware thongs or somthing like that lol|`|2g4XZGpVaa	They check your vision, your urine, joints and everything like that. And ummm unless things have changed in 9 years, you don't have to bend over with your pants off. They check your heart and lungs and stomach (by touching it) to make sure you are healthy enough to play sports.
BFBEOJsvaa	The ammo headstamped with "SO", "SO43" or "V P T" at the 12 o'clock position on the case head is the most common Finnish military 9mm headstamped ammo. "VPT" is Valtion Patruunatehdas, Lapua. You can tell the date of mfg. by the bottom number (usually a 2-digit number like "44"=1944), or in the case of "SO43", the 43=1943).     9.00 is 9 mm pistol    "herm." means hermetically sealed - which means it's good to go after decades    That is about all I know and the surplus Lapua ammo is known to be on the warm side.
DhEZj9cKaa	Alligators that live in the snow.|`|IbO4LiC5aa	Ski Pants that keep you dry very useful|`|pOLBKKNpaa	I think they're like crocodiles & they live in avalanche fields    ha ha, that snow joke    really: they snap onto your boots and zip up toward the knee to keep snow and slush out of your socks and boots|`|qyATAaeXaa	They are not pants. Gaiters are coverings that go over your lower leg and the top of your boots. They keep out things like snow, dirt, mud, and water (if Gore-Tex.) They come in various sizes and lengths so try them on in the store with the boots you plan to wear them with before you buy them. I bought a pair once and didn't try them on. They were the wrong size and I had to drive 90 minutes back to the store to get the right size.     Here's a link with a picture:  http://www.outdoorresearch.com/site/brow...|`|wmyew1ERaa	Two answers:  I assume, since the noun is plural that these are short leggings that go from the top of your boots a ways up your legs to prevent snow from getting into your boots. Proper ski pants have built in gaiters at the bottom of the legs and so don't need separate one. Also, the soft fuzzy tube that you pull down over your head and wear around your neck and pull up over your face when it's really cold is called a 'neck gaiter'. Hope this helps.
o6EUAn83aa	I would suggest that you workout your legs a bunch, you may see your weight dropping by a few pounds, but you'll be fine, you may also want to start sprinting a lot to get your body used to an excersise like the 40 yard dash.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	Seriously?  Try running 50 yards instead of 40, but use the same standards.|`|kGRkjw6Qaa	Squats and speed ladder. You have to give your legs power and fast twitch in order to have an explosive time. And work on your start, a lot of it is form and how efficiently you run, that can shave some time off, not much but some.|`|i9TAPrmDaa	no. You do not run that. You are fat. You will never run a 4.5 unless you lose weight. Good lie though fatty

OfNTLq3Qaa	I hope Orton punts Shane in the head. Shane throws weak punches and just butchered the promo to open Raw. He has no passion and it shows.|`|NZKramllaa	I sort of Predicted that already, but still a good match.      BQ: Yea, Its pretty Cool.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	It'll be a good match, since its a special no holds barred match, which will cover Shanes weaknesses|`|ZOPf2Ut1aa	what|`|HYw0YE7Gaa	Wtf?|`|caczNImxaa	its official  good  randy orton  bq:i think its cool but it could be better|`|HRvPoQzKaa	It's gonna be INTENSE.    I think Randy's gonna win because he cheats a lot.|`|pnsp765saa	Good    I will enjoy seeing Shane wrestle again.     Orton will win when Steph cost the match on purpose    I am planning on getting it.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Uh Moderate counting on Shanes skills displayed on the last RAW.  I'm hoping Orton will punt him in the head, but I'm sure they'll let Shane win. Maybe Vince will come out during the match or something.  BQ= Cool, but I think I like his old one better. I dont really understand this one.|`|aWVZb2Pgaa	Greeeeeeat! i cant wait for RKO to punt Shane!|`|w173betxaa	I think it'll be a good match.  I think Orton will win.  I gon't care for Orton's new shirt.|`|uiRkBwa9aa	this match will prove that ortons legacy will destroy anyone!!!!! but i want shane'o mac to win|`|9CLRMnhSaa	Yep!    Good match  Shane mcmahon    BQ:yes!          Mr.McMahon will return then!|`|rJMZdp04aa	WORD.  All I can say is -   WORD.    Pretty Obvious though.  Saw this coming like 3 weeks ago.      BQ - Yes.  It is - GREATNESS.|`|Xkm4PstOaa	Somehow, even though this guy isn't a wrestler, Shan O'mac can put on a great match!  So I'm excited to see him back in action!  It's been a while!  I still remember the Kurt Angle/Shane match like it was yesterday!  That was an awesome match!    I think that Orton will win, but, like I said, it should be a great match!    BQ:  Not sure.  I haven't seen it yet.  Sorry, I'm at work!  But I have Raw recording on my DVR, so I'm watching it when I get home.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	its gonna be a great match     but my i think shane would win..(its my opinion)    and i like the new shirt
EtWIJrR2aa	god yeah! 3-4km 4 days a week will get you in top shape!    im doing 3 times atm because of school but, its great!|`|CxriEMyjaa	We live on a river and my mom was doing a triatholon and she was doing only the swimming part and some times it wasn't for long and sometimes of was bit each day she planned she swam and she was in the wet shape just goes to show exercise I'd better then diets!!!|`|6kEKTjKiaa	Actually you won't see any results until you learn proper technique. Join a swim team/club and swim at least 5 times a week (preferably 7-9). After a year or two, you should start to see results in weight loss but not tone.  SWIMMING IS NOT MEANT TO TONE YOUR MUSCLES!! By swimming a lot, muscle mass will increase but tone will not. But swimming and lifting weights will help you get ripped. I advise you not to lift until you talk to a swim coach. Lifting and swimming at the same time can easily ruin you shoulders.|`|8S8gIJTfaa	probably|`|vkd7vAKfaa	i believe it will. it works out pretty much your whole body.|`|oDeQj71Oaa	well it depends.  how long you swim, the distance, and how intense it is.  if you are an okay swimmer you should swim at least an hour a day for 5 days a week. do this and i guarantee you that you will be in really good shape within 3 months. also when doing your swims go long distances without resting and then take short 30 sec. rests at the end of each 100 meters or 200 meters of swimming.    this is an example of what i do everyday:    i start out by running two miles  then i get in the pool and i do a 500 meter warm up  after that i start my sets:  - 50 meter sprint.  ten times  - 100 meters. 5 times  - 200 meters.  4 times  - 25 meter sprint. 20 times  - then end with a 50 meter cool down.    this usually takes about two hours  the swimming only takes 1 hour if your fast.
yS5f1XLFaa	well first you have to figure out what strokes are your best strokes and concentrate on that. then you have to figure out what the times are for that stroke so that you can work toward it. for instance:  mens 50 M free: 21.28  mens 100 M free: 47.50  mens 200 M free: 1:43.86  mens 400 M free: 3:40.08  mens 1500 M free: 14:34.56  mens 800 M free: 7:38.65  mens 100 M fly: 50.40  mens 200 fly: 1:52.09  mens 100 breast: 59.13  mens 200 breast: 2:07.51  mens 100 back: 52.89  mens 200 back: 1:54.32  mens 200 medley: 1:54.80  mens 400 medley: 4:05.25    then you just practice practice practice and race race race until you get close to those times. i would just focus on either swim or water polo cuz if u wanna go 2 the london olympics ur only gonna have time to train for 1. good luck!|`|6kEKTjKiaa	first of all you're not going to make. I know this because any swimmer who actually cares about his/her sport knows what it takes to get into these top level competitions. Plus it takes more than four years of preparation, more like 18 years of year-round dedication.  Even in water polo, which my cousin does, most of the guys are in college anyway.|`|txfebYGVaa	Not knowing what year of high school you're in makes this a difficult question to answer, but I'd say focus on something more realistic like playing in college. You may be good right now in high school, but the difference in the level of play from high school to college is huge, and from college to olympic level is too. I wouldn't stress over the olympics. Just play the game and have fun. If you're good enough you'll get noticed by the right people.
ZPJyVOpTaa	First of all, Ben is WAY too young to be even considered a HOF, so i dont know what your thinking. I think your just hyped up on the SB win because your team one. It will go away after a few weeks. Yea he got 2 rings but i dont think it was because of him. Yea he makes great plays once in a while, but he was a QB brought in to make throws when needed. Even though they were banged up at the RB position all season long, they are a running team. He was brought in like how Eli Manning was brought to the Giants for. Throw the ball when needed. Run first throw second. Both have rings but as a Giants fan, i think they won the SB because of their defenses, not their QBs. I dont think you can compare Ben nor Eli with the top flight QBs like Brady, Warner, Peyton Manning, ect. The real HOF contenders. This is just my opinion though.|`|932b9cfe7a05bb25d03a132b597eff85aa	Dude big ben wins rigged superbowls... how can you put him in the hall for that?|`|5BQM1hTTaa	Yes he is Hall of Fame worthy.|`|Z4ApIxaeaa	he is a winner, because he inherited a winning team, that is why they did just as good when he missed games and Leftwich was playing|`|i9TAPrmDaa	That ay caramba guy is stupid. And is probably being bias. No, Ben Roethlisberger's stats aren't as good as Warner's. But he gets it done when he needs to. And yes, he will be a HOFer|`|3v3Luu1oaa	If he continues the way he is he will...he's 2nd best to Tom Brady right now, ahead of Manning and company|`|DkwgogXZaa	yeah he'd get in based on what he's done already|`|QtjnmEzoaa	He's had a great career so far. Just keep in mind he's very young. He's got a lot of years left. But if he keeps playing the same way, he'll be a lock.    Jacob W... better than Peyton Manning? Really? Try to be a little bit objective.|`|60534ad637bb9eeb3a3f4a6859dbba83aa	He's not a winner. He's a player on a team that can win. There's a big difference there. He's not leading the team to wins, his D is. Thus, he's not a HOFer|`|AA10939368	Big Ben is a great quarterback who often does not receive the respect that he deserves.  I believe that when his career is over he will enter the hall of fame, it is too early at this point to make that consideration.  Personally, I do not believe  five years is long enough.     You also left out the fact that he leads the NFL with the most wins in his first five years.
Ar5VHDiBaa	They are made in Indianapolis & they make enough for EACH team.... the winners get to wear their Superbowl gear & the gear for the losers get sent to 3rd world Countries...... last year a girl's soccer team used their free Patriots 19-0 shirts as team jerseys since they couldn't afford to buy them...... they actually won their championship|`|fHxpycJSaa	They are pre-made for both teams. Same thing with the hats.|`|RZIV15e3aa	Yes. They knew the Cardinals would be a doormat and would be an easy win in the Super Bowl. No surprise that the Cards lost.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	Yes. I'm not sure if they take care of the losing teams' sets the same way every year, but I know there are a bunch of Nicaraguan orphans running around with "New England Patriots, Superbowl XLII Champions" T-shirts and hats on.|`|AKfZDADmaa	They have it made before the superbowl. After, they advertise them on tv and say Congratulations your team has just one the superbowl. Then they tell them about the shirts and other stuff like dvd's and more.|`|AA10939368	Shirts and hats for both teams are premade and taken to the field.  They just did a story on this a couple days prior to the superbowl.  Last year they kept switching the shirts as there was no clear winner until the end.  I am sure the same this year.      The shirts and hats for the losing team are sent to the poorest parts of the world.|`|nr6KBe8Naa	they already have them made for each team and they donate the ones of the loosing teams to charities in Arizona!! haha|`|5BQM1hTTaa	They make the clothes before the game.  The clothing of the losing team are shipped to poor towns in Africa where they are put to good use.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	They were already made.  They make them for both teams prior to the game, and it is rumored that all of the "Cardinals World Champions" gear gets sent to third world countries.  Although I think it would be cool to own one and freak people out!|`|S71lfad2aa	they always have two pairs of shirts ready so who ever wins gets the shirt and with the losing team they ship them to third world countries.  for instance last year they sent them some were near India and girls soccer team used them as their uniform and actually won despite wearing 19-0 for the patriots.  and the year before that the Chicago one's went to Africa i think you might be able to find it if you look around the web.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	They print up a set for each team before the game.  I'm not sure what the NFL does, but I understand the NBA donates the unused shirts and hats to a charity overseas....apparently, somewhere in Bangladesh there are kids wearing "2008 NBA Champion Lakers" shirts.|`|3XUuxALyaa	yes they make enough for both teams. the others would be destroyed. though i bet some are stolen and they then become collectors items.|`|PZl0aZwcaa	they make them for both teams, the losing team's are donated to africa or someplace|`|C2CCbTRKaa	THE SHIRTS AND HATS ARE PRE PRINTED.THE LOSING TEAMS SHIRTS AND HATS ARE SENT TO THIRLD WORLD COUNTRIES,THAT,S WHERE I WISH THEY WOULD SEND THE STEELER FANS!!|`|68901cc226a1a5e64d9b9e9528736f88aa	Game was pre-determined.|`|BZpF8nSsaa	yea they had enough for the teams pre-made, for both sides.....so right after the game santonio homles got a Steelers SB champion hat, and it had probably sitting there for a few days|`|0BgzkLdUaa	Yeah, of course they have them pre-made. The Cardinals also had all of their Super Bowl Champs merch ready, but you would never know that since they didn't win.|`|q22BlmN8aa	They make all of the winning team shirts pre-made for all of the teams so they can make a ton - o money selling the winning teams shirts after the game(s).|`|47a68a71f168bb8b3083aa4a67f5ff9eaa	they make shirts for both teams once the championship games have finished and they know for sure who's going to the superbowl.Then they give the shirts to the winning team I.E if the Cardinals had won they would have had their shirts on.|`|gdnzuq2Laa	they always make everything in advance for both teams|`|AA10190065	They have the winner's shirts already made beforehand. If the Cardinals won, they would've had shirts already made for them. The league already have shirts and hats made for each team. They do this in all sports.|`|6VsjiOWKaa	They make both Super Bowl competitor shirts, hats, and other items beforehand. Remember all those 19-0 shirts they made for the Pats last year? They had to throw them away or have a  Boston Shirt Party.

4JkdxfjJaa	A miss fire means that the gun did not fire and the bullet did not leave the barrel or shell. In dangerous game situations "Never use an untried rifle"- Lt. Colonel John Henry Patterson, D.S.O, out of book "The Man-Eaters of Tsavo". The gun usually makes a metallic click and the gun does not fire.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	it's spelled misfire and it's when the cartridge doesn't fire or it at least the bullet doesn't leave the barrel, this usually happens with old ammo,.   the ammo's powder is usually wet or decaying, so it doesn't give the bullet enough energy to either break free of the case or at least not enough power to leave the barrel of the gun.  breaking the action or breaking the firing pin itself can sometimes be thought as a misfire and said to be one, but it's a malfunction of the gun instead of a misfire.  not like a jam, a jam happens when the case of the bullet gets stuck in the chamber or the action of the gun fails to open due to improper pressures needed to open it automatically, it can also be when two cartridges are trying to get through the chamber made for one cartridge, so they jam together and stop the gun from reloading..  not shooting straight is inaccuracy, not a misfire.|`|M6fzLJtmaa	A cartridge that does not discharge or that only partially discharges when fired in a cartridge-firing firearm.  A jam is it gets stuck usually on the way out|`|nooi0ldjaa	in 'easy' terms...its when the gun is loaded and you pull the trigger and nothing happens.      /edit  no, not the same as a jam, a jam is just that...when things get jamed...a miss fire is when the fireing pin hits the primer but nothing happens.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	A misfire is also called a "Fail to Fire" (FTF) malfunction.     It's when a round doesn't go off.     It can be considered a jam, since the corrective procedure is about the same. (SPORTS)|`|Fp50ZK2Laa	a misfire means that the gun doesnot fire correctly or at all.|`|svbFM4Zyaa	Its when a gun does not fire at all because something stops it from firing. The pin could be jammed, bad ammo, dirty bore a lot could cause this.|`|g4Dxlklxaa	A misfire usually refers to a bullet that had the primer hit, but it did not go off.|`|alaAuRhbaa	yeah it means a gun that was intended to be shot, but the bullet never went off|`|kY3uuTq9aa	When the hammer (or firing pin) hits the primer and it doesnt ignite the powder, causing the firearm to missfire.|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	A misfire is when the firing pin hits the primer; but the cartridge doesn't fire.      It's not quite the same as a jam.  With a jam, the gun malfunctions and the jam must be cleared before you can continue shooting.  Jams can be caused by an empty brass not being properly ejected; two rounds trying to be chambered at once; etc.  With a jam, you simply determine why the gun stopped working, fix it, and keep shooting.      With a misfire, the primer has been crushed but the gunpowder hasn't ignited (yet).  Misfires are more dangerous than jams because misfires can become hang-fires; in which the gun fires after a delay of several moments.  Sometimes the primer will have sparked; but the gunpowder doesn't ignite immediately like it is supposed to; which can become a delayed ignition.  You want to keep the gun pointed in a safe direction and wait for a minute or so to be sure the cartridge isn't going to go off.  Then you can cycle the action and continue firing.    That being said; most people don't follow that procedure for misfires.  Especially with centerfire guns, misfires are not common and hang-fires are even less common.  Most of the time, if a gun misfires the shooter will cycle the action to load the next round and keep firing without waiting.  But if the misfired cartridge is ejected and then the gunpowder catches, it will become a grenade-like explosion; sending little pieces of brass in many directions.|`|vea6mqPZaa	A misfire is when you put a live round in the chamber, pull the trigger, the hammer falls, the firing pin strikes the primer and all you get is a click no boom.    There are 2 things that cause misfires  1 - Bad round (will not ignite)  2 - Bad weapon (does not have enough strike to ignite the primer)    Either case is spooky to say the least. All you do is eject the misfire and reload a new one in the chamber.

OHs8yJiOaa	It might largely depend on the lighting itself and if you often have problems with it or not.    The high vis lenses can filter some glare for you from the lights, and their contrast enhancement might make it easier to pick things up. However, you're unlikely to wear them nonstop, and that split second it takes your eyes to adjust if/when you drop them into place might not go over too well.    If you're having major problems with lighting somewhat blinding you or intefering with your vision, I might look into them, but I'd look more to them to remove problems than to improve or better your vision.    If you can find an Oakley or sporting goods store near you, you might want to try some on firsthand to see if the color alterations would be annoying or not. I expect you'd be able to tell pretty quickly if they'd be a huge benefit or a bust for you.    Some polarized Oakley "contrast" lenses might be a benefit for day games, however. If you do something like the flak jackets or radars, you can switch out lenses for different conditions, too. The high vis lenses like the H.I. Persimmon tend to be on the less expensive side as well.|`|Jq33R6TDaa	no for some people they may say it does but i have always felt they just make it harder too see because they may glare and change your visin
8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	What up Cyrusman,    Bynum will be out 8-12 weeks which is actually good news- considering at first there was concern that he might be out until next season.  The Lakers will be able to sustain and should be able to finish as the 1 seed in the West- although the injury does not help them in their pursuit for the best record overall in the league to ensure home court advantage throughout the playoffs.    Bynum's injury may be a bit longer than Jordan's for several reason.  One is simply that Bynum is a lot heavier than Jordan so that's more weight on that knee.     Also Bynum hurt his other knee last year- so that may also be a factor.  It's always approximate and you have to see how the knee responds-- in the knee when a bone rubs against a bone it causes inflammation and so some people get more inflamed and can handle the pain better than others.  So a lot of it will do with how quickly he heals.    Nickster|`|Mn97YDIyaa	8-12 weeks. He'll be out until around the start of the playoffs.|`|keUqPWVuaa	Grade I MCL Tear  This is an incomplete tear of the MCL. The tendon is still in continuity, and the symptoms are usually minimal. Patients usually complain of pain with pressure on the MCL, and may be able to return to their sport very quickly. Most athletes miss 1-2 weeks of play.     Grade II MCL Tear  Grade II injuries are also considered incomplete tears of the MCL. These patients may complain of instability when attempting to cut or pivot. The pain and swelling is more significant, and usually a period of 3-4 weeks of rest is necessary.     Grade III MCL Tear  A grade III injury is a complete tear of the MCL. Patients have significant pain and swelling, and often have difficulty bending the knee. Instability, or giving out, is a common finding with grade III MCL tears. A knee brace or a knee immobilizer is usually needed for comfort, and healing may take 6 weeks or longer.    Bynum has a grade III tear of the MCL the LAKERS will be lucky if he returns in 8-12 weeks.    When a grade III injury occurs, patients usually wear a knee immobilizer and protect weight-bearing (crutches) for the first week to 10 days following injury. Patients should remove the immobilizer several times a day to work on bending their knee. After that time, the patient can begin wearing a hinged knee brace, and can begin to increase their range of motion in the knee. They can apply more weight to the knee as pain allows.   Once the patient can flex the knee at least to 100 degrees, they may begin riding a stationary bicycle. The crutches can be discontinued once the patient is able to walk without limping. Jogging can begin once the patient has regained 60% of their quadriceps strength (compared to the opposite side), and agility drills can begin once they have regained 80% of their strength. Complete rehab from a grade III MCL tear can take 3-4 months.|`|3eI8jxqraa	8 weeks|`|I8e21Hwoaa	i dunno but he hurt gerald wallace....    he kinda had it comin...

2bqmotqlaa	a ttr 125 is a trail bike   get a real bike if you want to jump  YOU CANT DO TRICKS ON THAT   GROW UP AND RIDE BIG  cr125 all day|`|qM4cMNufaa	its a crap bike all around exept if you trail ride get a yz 85 or yz125|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Not sure what the zacs mean by "BBR Kit". BBR makes a set of stiffer fork springs and a stiffer rear shock spring. These will keep the bike from bottoming over larger jumps but it also makes the bike extremely harsh. What some folks do is only install one of the BBR fork springs and leave the other leg stock. The BBR springs will not make your suspension better, just stiffer. The TT-R is a great trail bike, but is not intended for motocross and jumping. Not that you can't jump it at all, you just can't jump it big.|`|b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	The bike you have is a a basic trail bike and great for a beginner just riding trails.  They are not good for mx and not good for any sort of tricks.  If you intend to jump then you really would be better off saving up and getting something like a crf150r as the amount that you would spend on making what you have suitable for mx would outdo any amount you may spend on upgrading.|`|dcDRHNDQaa	auburn is right. it's a trail bike you want a motocross bike, go buy a motocross bike jumping is what their made for.|`|GWzoQ0iaaa	if you can ride a dirtbike like me you can backflip that *****. haha  you gotta ride what ya got.

Those ttr will last for ever. I dont expect you to go and spend tons of money on a BBR kit, or go buy a new bike. Too make your landings a little smoother and to get a little better preload, I would get some stiffer fork springs. They are between 95.00 and a 100.00 bucks. (Ebay) Then put a little less fork oil. This is the most inexpensive.
oqiH3fCCaa	YES! You should defiantly join track. Even if you aren't the best runner you can always meet new people and besides, you need to start some time.

0xm2Dd1gaa	No its not a waste of time! How is it being a failure when your team doesn't win the championship game? I've always been a fan of the Cowboys, Mavericks, Stars, Desperados, and Arsenal (UEFA), the Mavs have never won a championship, i'm 20, so most of my life the 'Boys have not won a playoff game, let alone a championship, Desperados have never won a championship game. Looking at that, 3 are by your logic failures, but I love them and cheer  for them. So what i'm trying to say is find a team that you can really pull for, and get behind, and quit with the fair weather fan stuff, because once the bad is over with, and your team is back on top, no one can call you a bandwagon jumper.|`|O2jH0yVFaa	No, it is not|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	Yes, just keep hope! They can turn around, DONT BE A BANDWAGONER, you will be hated SO much!|`|RZIV15e3aa	No. You should become an EAGLES FAN!!! The Eagles will probably make it to the Super Bowl next year. Being a Cardinal fan is a waste of time however. The Cards will NEVER win a Super Bowl ever. E-A-G-L-E-S. EAGLES.|`|Yb0182Vxaa	then you are obviously not a true fan, a true fan stay with their team through the good times and the bad times|`|rjuqrHK7aa	No it's not a waste of time. I am a Bengals fan and have had a lot of losing as a fan. A true fan will stick with their fan through everything. I felt great when the Bengals made the playoffs in 2005 after all the years of losing. Who thought the Arizona Cardinals and Tampa Bay Rays could make it to a championship game. I will always stay with my teams. Win or Lose.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Nope I'm a Charger fan and they have no SB wins but I keep cheering. I will never bandwagon onto the Steelers like most of their fans.|`|wMHw20WPaa	nope keep cheering|`|C2CCbTRKaa	IF IT,S THE DETROIT LIONS,FRUITLESS!!|`|J74Y5LKxaa	I'd rather be the fan of a team that doesn't always win like the Chargers, then a fairweather BANDWAGON fan who's been chearing for the Patriots only during the seasons they've made it to the Super Bowl.  And as much as I can't stand the Raiders, at least their fans don't hide when they lose (which is quite often these days)|`|DvKpx0Reaa	no! it's worse (in my opinion), when you switch teams and cheer for a winning team because people start to call you a bandwagoner and "unloyal". i loved new england in 2002 when they didn't make the play-offs, or even before drew bledsoe era, when the pats got into somewhat of a winning streak. my point is (if there is one...), that you should stick with those teams through the ups and the downs and when they finally DO make it into the play-offs (if they do), then you won't have to be called a "bandwagoner" or a "front-runner" (i know, lame name) and you can savor all those moments when you thought they would never make it there|`|VghVdPfsaa	Part of being a sports fan is standing by your team no matter what. Although my teams (Yanks, Devils and Chargers) can be considered more successful as of late, I still know a little how you feel. It can be frustrating, so much that you feel like puching the wall a million times.    But it's not a waste of time. Often after my teams are out of it, I feel like hating the world, but there's always next year. And sports have so much parity these days, anyone can go from worst to first in a matter of one or two seasons. And as a Dolphins fan, you know that first hand.|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	No, it's not a waste of time; it's a noble, poetic pursuit.  Don't be one of those fair-weather fans who only wants to support winners.  Be for the underdogs -- it's character-building.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	No because once they become good people cant call you a bandwagon jumper, I am a fan of the Eagles, but I also like the Houston Texans, a team of failure, but now there is a glimmer of hope and recently I got my Steve Slaton jersey showing my pride, and next year when they take the number one spot, people cant call me a frontrunner or bandwagon jumper.|`|6tGYe5roaa	No I do not think it is a waste of time. Being a fan is all about the highs and the lows of rooting for your favorite team. And when the do finally win, it will be that much sweeter. And their time will eventually come. Look how long Red Sox fans had to wait. But when they finally win it all, you'll be glad you stuck around.|`|tNerdFYsaa	your day will come..i understand what your going through being a Jets fan. 40 years since our last super bowl apperance! im just hoping it comes soon|`|0HI1k9Oaaa	STICK BY YOUR TEAM!    if u switch people ll think ur a front runner and u will be    every team comes back or gets good for once(even if its in like 100 years LOL)..id stick with it especially it u have been for 24 years|`|flahjTR9aa	i dont think so if it is a team you really like|`|ntLUHiTAaa	wooooo !!!!!!!!!go fins
MzmDqZ26aa	Size always matters. You could be a black belt, but still get dropped by a guy who has 100lbs of muscle on you.    Also, girls generally have weaker strikes due to less muscle mass, and strength is essential in any fight (anyone who advocates doing precise spin-kicks or something of that nature hasn't been in a fight). Without strength, anything short of hitting well-guarded weak points (throat/eyes/groin) will not be effective.    The techniques used are important as well. Many martial arts taught are not designed for effective, practical combat. This is why they don't often teach throat strikes.|`|z7aYNtojaa	Him, in karate you are trained to fight people bigger than you, and fighting lots of people. She CAN kick your @$$|`|6TVZ4fdlaa	Well I dont know how strong you are compared to your girlfriend but it doesnt matter what you have between the legs it only matters of how well you can fight so technically both of you could be right because again i cant compare you two fighting without visual notices but in general he's right.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|f9d88043d8ba88ae6d8cec415fe76179aa	You are right.

I am a blue stripe in tae kwon do and I sparred against a 6th degree back belt and  a first degree black belt and  its scary.  the  moves they know how to do and  how quick. I almost  got my teacher ( 6th degree black belt ) in the face though with a kick.   he  punched me lightly in the stomach two times consecutively  and he even told e to guard my stomach too.   He stopped the fight after the second time cuz  I couldnt  block  fast enough.  I whooped up on the other competition though  that were around my  belt color.   People were afraid of my kicks because  I had  quick  feet I could kick 2 times when  they could only kick once.  I am into Meditation now more than  fighting.   So  don't  mess around with a black belt male or female  !!!|`|vja4ddNmaa	Jujitsu is mainly defense against physical attacks. It's primary purpose is proper instruction of responses to attacks. Your girlfriend could know some of the several spots of the human body that will knock out or kill a man with little force, hence being able to knock you out with a single chop or kick. She would not be able to throw you around like a rag doll. Your friend is either poking fun or really has watched to many movies, in my opinion.|`|XWsD2329aa	It depends on the trainer of jujitsu. It is made to train any size person to be able to make their opponent back down. Now the label itself "black belt" these days isn't the same as it used to be. A lot of people can just go in and get their black belt in 1 year and thats def. not enough time to build the skills needed to defend yourself. Now if she did have a trainer that taught her right and she's been training for enough time and  worked hard enough then size again wont matter in that form of Martial Arts.

You basically would be giving her your arm to use against you. Bruce Lee was 5'5'' and 125 lbs..he would look for people with abnormaly large features to spar with to understand the differences of size.    Now if you have some degree of knowledge on how to defend and attack and you are bigger than her..you probably could win, but all she would need to do is mess up your foot, knee or eye, or finger, and you would be toast.

It does not mean that the black belt will win every time, regardless of their sex or size.

I don't think your girl could do that to you, but an 8th degree black belt in let's say tae kwon doe would probably kick anyone's butt. It all depends on whether they train consistently and what type of martial art it is.|`|i8ySLyjLaa	not always. some schools give out black belts for doing nothing.    however, jujitsu is pretty serious stuff. yeah, she'd probably win. i do karate with this on girl and she is a little shorter than me, but she could definitely kick my a**.    :)

If there is a college nearby check into the physical therapy program or even sports medicine they often have people who need experience with special needs individuals and will do it for free.

You can find them on a wide variety of websites.  There are big ones in Idaho and in Las Vegas.  Some are smokers or tournaments, others, like Tuff n Uff, have near pro level production values.      If you want to compete, your best best is to join an active camp that attends a few of these events.  And good luck, they can be very tough.

The reason is simply that they're one of two teams in my area (Jets and Giants), and at the time I started getting into football, I found the Jets' players and coaches more likeable.

But, I think that Randy will win, unfortunately.|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Orton is probably going to win as momentum for his championship match at wrestlemania.

It's just my opinion though.|`|3sH9G1hPaa	i want shane to win

USA will put together its "A" Squad.|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	Noooooo read your articles right....    right now the list that was given was the list that was going to be in the US camp training, and which are all MLS based players, the "europeans" will come into the US team by next week.     I seriously doubt that Howard, Bocanegra, Cherundulo, Bradley, etc. will be left out....|`|Jqlfj74Oaa	not true....    that would be suicide for teh u.s.|`|PowkYTGJaa	Nope do u think those gringos are gonna hold back when theyre gonna face their Daddys!!|`|1fwo8HqMaa	no dude.|`|pZdFrAnNaa	nahh they just called up mls players for training only to see who is good enough to play against mexico     THEN theyre gonna bring their "eurupeans"    u know theyere badass players from teams like    cardiff city  xerez  Brescia  Borussia M?nchengladbach  Nordsj?lland  Midtjylland  Hansa Rostock  V?lerenga  Watford  Hammarby  Fulham  everton    u know.....|`|HVE2kX6Raa	It would actually be a game if the USA used MLS players. I expect the starting 11 for the USA to be:    Howard    Cherundolo, Onyewu, Bocanegra, Pierce    Beasley, Bradley, Dempsey, Donovan, Klajestan (I don't know how to spell his name)    Ching    I don't know if it will be a 4-5-1, but I expect a variation of it. Donovan and Dempsey as CAM and Ching up top. I would feel better with Hejduk starting instead of Pierce, but I don't think so. So no, the USA will not be using MLS players. I haven't found out officialy which players will come from Europe, but I expect all of the important ones to come back. USA vs. Mexico is one of the best rivalries in the world of sports.|`|33YAhRXFaa	nope. if anything they might not use any mls players in the starting lineup.    howard, england  cherundolo, germany  onyewu, belgium  bocanegra, france  pearce, germany  beasley, scotland  bradley, germany  dempsey, england  torres, mexico  donovan, germany  altidore, spain
325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	Listen very closely:  if you go to a good camp or school (one that has produced good fighters) then you are ready when your coach says you are ready and not a minute before.    Tell him you want to fight and ask him for his advice.  But trust him and don't try to make decisions for yourself unless you've trained for 18 months or so and he just hasn't found anything for you.    If you don't go to a good camp, you need to go find a good camp.|`|u93eagkqaa	It really depends on the individual. Some people are really talented and do not take as much time to get ready for a fight. If you have never fought in your life get lots of sparing in and get the opinion from your trainer and fellow gym partners.
nQlwiHfLaa	No NHL team has flown commercial airlines since 9/11 and many had abandoned them earlier.     They all travel by charter now, but I can't recall if any of teams actually own their own plane these days.|`|76nTvO4iaa	The Dallas Stars share a plane with the Texas Rangers, since both teams have the same ownership group.|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	Here is the Dallas Stars plane - they got a new one in 2007.  http://stars.nhl.com/team/app/?service=p...|`|9vLzGwVqaa	They definitely have there own team planes!|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Yes they do because they can afford they are rich and in this Tough Economy they are smart too, Private Jet Planes over Advertisements.    That's the real NHL.|`|hHXG8ef6aa	ya they have their own|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	It makes no financial sense to actually own a plane (and we won't even get into the insurance aspect of things), however teams fly on chartered aircraft.  They can just pull up, get on, and go (especially after games).|`|naZQqrNeaa	^^^Great answer, Zap.  It is nice seeing you around.|`|DbfG5Cpraa	Prop plane charters lol|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	I don't know about anyone else, but the Detroit Red Wings have their own private jet called the Red Bird 2.. I believe they share it with the Tigers..
AA11729094	Make sure your pistol is completely unloaded and the magazine removed. Take a ball point pen and depress the rear of the slide, where you can see the firing pin inside the little hole, while depressing this button down, gently bring the slide rearwards and slightly upwards at the rear to disengage the slide from the rails. You may need to depress the button about an inch before it releases the slide. Once the rear of the slide disengages from the rail, allow it to ride back forward and off the slide rails, reassembly is the same steps in reverse.
zLUQJxJkaa	Yes you will be increasing your leg strength. The reason is because your muscles are needed for balance (even when you walk and that sort of thing).   When i started training i didn't get much of a point to this stance either, all it did for me was hurt! But eventually i realized it was a good thing.    (Not intending to brag), I can hold this stance for over a half hour and I can definitely say that the benefits of it are there.  Final answer: Yep that's a good stance that'll help build muscle.    P.S. in terms of what the stance is used for, all basic stances are to help with movements. In basics if you can get a really big technique down then you can do the small one. Horse stance is for side attacks, that lead into a spin technique. It's obviously too big for actually fighting/sparring, but that's the point.|`|LUnscegvaa	You will improve with practice !!!    Horse Stance training is excellent for conditioning.    Keep going ,Good luck and Best wishes :)***|`|hlqj0pvxaa	Yes - stance training builds strength and endurance.|`|u93eagkqaa	It's more about balance than strength. You learn to get your base and balance so you can use all of your body to explode.     Fighters that have no base have no power..

She'd whip the ball toward the sky,  Landing it in the hoop without (a) deny.  BD is the one whose middle name is "win"  When she throws it (the ball), she always gets it in.  Our team would definitely not be set   without wicked Bernadette.

4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	I wish rey would win again but unfortunately wwe just doesn't push the guy when he's talented. I miss him as champion and a former world champion being in mid cards or lower just seems wrong to me when a guy like rey mysterio has such excitement. Yeah i agree that him going against power house wrestlers would definitely help the line of the ultimate underdog. I have a feeling that cena or jericho might win this EC.  He might win the IC championship this year before getting another world championship shot like what they're doing to CM Punk.   619!|`|yetGbkdBaa	i hope so. rey mysterio winning a title is just so exiciting for some reason.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	Nah, he's getting a mid-carder push so I wouldn't be surprised if he won the intercontinental title|`|w173betxaa	no, he never should have won that title in the first place, emphasis on the word heavyweight.|`|rRIYB9WNaa	Possibly.|`|pnsp765saa	Likely, Raw will run of star some time and they know we don't want Cena as champ for another year|`|QQyWUDI8aa	it could happen you never know with the wwe|`|sc3e8KgVaa	Rey needs a boost, and personally I hope he wins the Chamber... can you imagine it?

D6Llh23Baa	i used to watch slamball years ago. but now, i just don't have the time for it. it is more entertaining than the NBA, though. funny, they should wear headgears. there was this one time, when a stopper fell awkwardly, hitting his head on the island. good thing he wore protection. (and that the island was padded)  really, 8 franchises? a longer season means more entertainment.  have fun watching and supporting slamball!

I actually think if Bynum was in, it would of been a 20-30 point blowout. And it's sad because Chandler, Lee and even Jeffries had solid games. And about Nate, I don't know why he was out for as long as he was. The whole night he was out of control with the ball 4-14 FGM-A and 0-4 3PM-A again he was trying to be fancy with the ball, and it hurt the Knicks.|`|uxregJ0faa	LOL. LBJ is going to drop 40.

1Z0Lmrk1aa	All these clowns on here feigning they don't hate the Lakers is freaking priceless. There just trying to deflect there hate so it doesn't look so obvious. Bynum will be back, count on it haters.|`|keUqPWVuaa	Without Bynum the Lakers are no longer the best in the West, they only beat the Spurs last year because they were to injury riddled. Now the Spurs have just become the team to beat in the West. Sorry Lakers fans, as hard as that may be for you to swallow, but the Spurs already beat your team once with a full roster, so I don't think your team can handle SA with a depleted roster. Gasol just isn't enough to contend with Duncan, (Bynum was able to play against him pretty well, but Gasol is scared of Duncan). Bowen slows Kobe down pretty good, and Matt Bonner does a good job with Odem. Your team has NO answer for Ginobili, and never has. Parker break fisher ankles 1 on 1, that's why they have to use a bigger man on him, but then who will cover Mason, ( between him and Bonner are the best 3pt shooters in the NBA this season). The only place SA is lacking depth is with a powerful big man. Now that LA has lost their most dominate big it puts them at a disadvantage to SA since SA has more shooters and a better big. Plus SA is the better outside shooting team. so Duncan can doesn't have the scoring droughts from his shooters like last season.    As for being glad Bynum is hurt, NOTHING could be further from the truth. I would never wish harm on any player (some fans maybe),but I would never want to see a player hurt. Bynum is a tremendous young talent and the tutelge of Kereem was just starting to payoff. As they say, "the light had come on" in that young man and he was playing great ball. It was enjoyable to watch his development. It's a shame that it is being riddled with so many major injuries, because that has a tendency to catch up on the back side of your career.|`|vq4DYBGgaa	he should be back for the playoffs...I don't think it was as serious as last time|`|DnWsMhwLaa	i donno, some guys are just injury prone. to early to say if he can be effective again by the playoffs, but if i were a laker fan i would be more worried that he is one of those guys who just seems to get injured every year. it is a shame for the league and the lakers.|`|m501HwyWaa	True laker fans will not the bynum excuse for losses|`|N3AiQRJFaa	Bynum should be able to return by the playoffs|`|f9soMMuiaa	BALL DON'T LIE.     or more like..

He is out for 8-12 weeks, then you add another week or two to build his strength in the knee back, so it's a pretty tight schedule.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	i don't feel happy that Bynum is injured. i feel angry because Lakers fans will use the "no Bynum" excuse again when they choke in the playoffs like last year. watch, they will get run over like a mack truck by the Celtics on Thursday.    na na na na hey hey hey goodbye Fakers!|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	Sorry this was your opportunity to do so, but there is something about KOBE..that stops him from achieving glory..his personality

I wanted it to get better but it never did. Jennifer Hudson should have done halftime too.|`|gDKIxwRSaa	I did.. and it was horrible..|`|6tGYe5roaa	I caught some of it but I did not watch the whole thing. I was eating. The show didn't really interest me all that much.|`|l3y23yVcaa	Bored to tears my man...      Horn!!!|`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	I did.....|`|7sMyItRDaa	I hit some internet porn instead.

Mostly just made fun of the older generation for liking it. However it isn't likely in 30 years we are going to see Lil Wayne at a halftime show. So apparently somebody likes his music.|`|HNE7dJQiaa	i watched the puppy bowl, wew!!!|`|6Cp66xdbaa	i didn't , i wasn't planning on watching it to begin with ..|`|CWu69yG8aa	i watched wipeout, that show is hilarious!|`|a6EndAPiaa	Keeps hands firmly on keyboard LOL    I watched the kitten half time show on Animal planet.|`|90ZaNZE4aa	i did but it was boring    i mean that they got a guy doing a show from the times when my parents were still hs|`|jd14u32qaa	I was listening to it, as with most of the game.

zFpHpqiLaa	probably laughin at bynum but he dont wanna laugh too hard it's no good for his lung that was a bad collision though gotta feel sorry 4 wallace and bynum 4 being out 4 the season|`|FUoKu13Daa	He might be thinking of this is Karma,     But I do not think Bynum is no shape meant to hurt Wallace like he did and from what I read he tried to see him in person to apologize and even call him but that is what I read and not sure if this is true or not but I can't see any player wanting to put someone health in jeopardy over a game.|`|wKGZ0h8Paa	He's thinking revenge without doing the actual work is sweet.|`|Ga11Abmzaa	Yo, dude getta life whats up with you hatin on Bynum for?
d5q8PvPuaa	Umm....Bynum.  Because he is a laker. And all Laker injuries are blown outta porpotion.|`|xJxQRJ8yaa	Andrew Bynum:    Check this out, Bynum injured the SAME knee at about the SAME time he did last year and is due to miss the SAME amount of time. He hurt his knee against the SAME team (the Grizzlies) and the same way with one of his OWN player crashing into him after he was on a hot streak.     Yao's injuries are kind of expected to happen due to his height. It's not uncommon that people over 7'5" have foot injuries.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Yao's injuries it's because of pressure of carrying a team, whereas Bynum's injuries are due to a 200lb + man crashing into his knee, I wouldn't consider him injury-prone just because of that, I mean I doubt LeBron can take one in the knee and still stand.|`|baf28a9e3a2f15cb8180363b8783c2edaa	Yao is degrading.    Bynum has bad luck with falling people.|`|UadP6GO8aa	I have to say Yao.|`|Ga11Abmzaa	Yao Ming he is bigger.|`|wsZz2ptmaa	Andrew Bynum|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	Andrew Bynum... i think he is the next Shaun Livingston.
wKGZ0h8Paa	Well it certainly starting to look like it.  I don't think he should retire but it would be tough for him.|`|UadP6GO8aa	Would you retire if you were Bynum? Of course not, because you would be making too much money.|`|zFpHpqiLaa	no he's a good player he plays d real well|`|Ga11Abmzaa	Whats his age?Why should he retire?|`|zamk8GDjaa	You are crazy and don't know a thing about the sport if you truly believe that!!!!!!!!|`|nAtBuBRhaa	No! Money is the root of all evil. He still get payed, injured or not. Why do you think Shaq's still playing?|`|f9BRmMNVaa	Bynum has already accomplished more than Bowie ever did.|`|MBOij8Enaa	LOL....NOOOOOOO!|`|wsZz2ptmaa	Hey dnt take this personally:  R u retarted in some way pal??!!!|`|FUoKu13Daa	no his should not retire,     Big man who sustain injuries have a tendency to take much longer to properly heal, If you look at Mihms he was basically out for almost 2 and a half year.    Bynum is young so he should be able to recover faster than someone that is older but I would agree the verdict is not in if he going to constantly have problem with his knee and it may very will be but it is way too early to think that.    The only person I think right now that should retire or maybe go to a team or stay in his own team and be only committed to 20 mins a game is Tracy McGrady.  This is a person that has a history of injury and I think now is a distraction to his team.|`|xJxQRJ8yaa	Andrew Bynum showed us that he was capable of coming back from the similar devastating injury last year. I won't doubt that he won't be able to do it again. He is only 20 years old and has way too much potential to retire. The Lakers would be stupid to release him or let him retire. The one big downside from the injury though is that he's going to get traumatized from this injury...he'll always be worried about hurting that knee so that may keep him from dominating like he was before the injury. The kid is a hard worker so I hope to see him back in dominating action next year.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	you wish.|`|3teWTOPqaa	No
OfNTLq3Qaa	The "Age of Orton."    I hope Shane learned how you really T-Off on someone. Nobody wants to see Shane and those weak punches again.|`|w173betxaa	Orton's the Man!|`|aWVZb2Pgaa	I love it!    But i hope they REALLY didn't get hurt.

I don't think anyone even remembers that SB.|`|0l9YOgkBaa	I do not care what the numbers are .It  was still a great game.
ofC4JQIhaa	Raymond Felton and LaMarcus Aldridge are the most underrated players in the NBA    Felton averages 14 points 7 assist 3 rebounds and gets 2 steals every game yet still know one has heard of him.I mean if he played on the Knicks he would be comsidered a top ten point guard but since he plays for the bobcats,nobody knows,nobody cares.    LaMarcus Aldridge averages 18 points 8 rebounds and 1 assist.Those numbers are better then most NBA centers and should be noticed.Plus hes a ball hawk,I mean whenever I see him play he never gets beat and plays some of the most underrated defense in the NBA.Againhe plays on the Trail Blazers,one of the least puplicied teams in the NBA,now if he was on the knicks,i wouldnt have wrote this blog.          Monta Ellis is a stud in his own right averaging 20 point,5 rebouns and 4 assist.He is one of the best small guards in the NBA and should get more credit for his work.|`|RBdy17Ahaa	Yes|`|zFpHpqiLaa	Joe Johnson is seriously underrated he averages like 22 ppg 6 assists and the hawks are doin well yet he still dont get enough credit for being the hawks best player i think he's as good as the likes of dwight paul pierce etc|`|ENBhz7Asaa	Kevin Durant is underrated.  He is great and is going to get alot better.|`|iFuO8gy7aa	michael redd  joe johnson  david west  kevin martin  kevin durant  brandon roy|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Kevin Durant...
tNerdFYsaa	He had an awful game...he came flying up the field, out of control and missed numerous tackles. Last night's game was not the real Troy Polamalu|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	yeah he wasnt to much of a beast yesterday|`|ambc6Q6Raa	missing tackles left and right. doesnt matter, everyone knows the pats won that ring|`|LGD4mTrYaa	He had a few tackles. He was in on the run support. I think a reason why you didn't hear his name a ton was because he was on Fitzgerald for a majority of the game.|`|8fe3c5c628ca1e4652c6de261ec861bfaa	He help stuffing the run and smashing Larry Fitzgerald at the line.    Too bad that some people just see "missed tackles". Did you see how many yards Arizona had on the ground?|`|HCcyja6Raa	he did do something: he was playing deep, protecting the defense from the deep threat. because of it, his stats were pretty empty...i think something like 2 tackles...but the plan worked for the most part, they only two huge plays they gave up were the slant to fitz when he sprinted for the TD and boldin's race down the sidelines...|`|rzkFHAEJaa	He didn't seem much of a factor.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	No but I'm sure he is happy with another ring.|`|Y43nptlvaa	He made me laugh at his unusually pitiful attempts.. I have all of his miss haps on TiVo|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	He wasnt all over the field like he usually is but that was because he was matched up against Fitzgerald most of the night. He wasnt roaming the field like he often does. He actually contained Fitzgerald for 35 minutes and couldnt stop him any longer in the 4th quarter. In my opinion, he did his job and contained Fitzgerald to 1 catch in the first 3 quarters. Not many DBs can do that, so yea he did have an impact on the game and the idiots above have no idea what they are talking about.|`|AA10939368	Troy's job last night was to contain Larry Fitzgerald and did that for most of the game, so he was not all over the field like a maniac.    The big score at the end occurred for  two reason, one the Steelers changed up their defense and two the Cardinals offensive line held James Harrison.|`|f4c5f36a540069fbe952ea342c721c74aa	43 Had 2 assists.  But you know....he did his job.  All of them did.  Otherwise the Steelers wouldn't have won the game.   Right?|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Yes, he won a Super Bowl ring.

j18XTAfqaa	Coach D' is a pioneer of basketball. While he is not very well known for defense, he has engineered a new style of run and gun showtime kind of style back to the league which is the favorite of many players.    Coach is really really really into the game and his players see that and they really appreciate it.    I think Pho fans were sad to loose him =(|`|13XU8cCKaa	I agree I love him too.  He has done a great job as Knicks head coach so far this season.  They may have more win this season at the all star break than they did last year at the end of the season.|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	Yeah, I agree.  He's one coach who gives freedom to his players to play their games.  He don't restrict their playing styles.  I just thought he was better off with Phoenix.|`|DNkavhfBaa	AFTER THE GAME ,HE GIVES THE WINNING TEAM TUG JOBS|`|98wFqBwSaa	No.|`|VFMt6g2iaa	I love him! =)|`|Vp3RrTpeaa	Yes it would be fun to play for him just running up and down the court while playing no defense at all.|`|GBGcI509aa	I agree.    But I love what hes done with the Knicks there gonna be a playoff contentender before long
pANpZ3vaaa	I thought the refs did a pretty good job.    They called against both teams, it wasn't like they didn't call any penalties on the steelers!    Cards played really great, and so did the steelers.  The reason the steelers won is because they are a better TEAM.  Also because most their player are matured and play for the entire team, not jsut themselves.  So they make less mistakes, because they dont want to let their team mates down.    Once the cards mature in the game, they will be awesome!|`|D4GHgDl4aa	The ball was clearly coming out of Warner's hand before he started forward. Fumble. It was the best super bowl ever and was a tough game to lose. Warner's yards passing were 2nd in super bowl history. Know who is number one ? Warner when he was with the Rams . Number 3? Warner with the Rams. Montana is 4th because Warner has only played in 3. Arizona fans should be proud of their team, but they lost to the Steelers, not the refs .|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	I doubt that all of the Cards' fans are blaming the refs. Of course, it's part of the human condition. Every fanbase is going to have some people that are a tad over-zealous. If the shoe was on the other foot many Steelers fans would be on YA! today screaming bloody murder.|`|utJYCCvaaa	yea they probaly would have left the short routes open and just let them catch it and just take them down in bounds they really didn't have that much of a chance and don't say Fitz would get the TD because they had him in double and where giving the short yard passes away|`|qjCl8paPaa	finally someone understands|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	I've watched every single Superbowl game and I honestly can say thier have been less than a dozen truely bad calls in the Superbowl.  The worst ever being a pass interference call on Everson Walls of Dallas on Lynn Swan.  Replay after replay, showed Walls tripped on the turf and then Swann got tangled in his legs.  That was probably the worst call ever.|`|TtTb78Coaa	the cardinals would of one the game if they had a better defense and if it wasnt for that interception that warner threw. even if warner got to throw that very last hail mary he would of just gave him self another interception. it was a great superbowl though|`|utBFEjAzaa	it was human nature|`|gDKIxwRSaa	I agree!  The Cardinals had PLENTY of chances to take the game.|`|4v0bhxsIaa	We will never know because the NFL Refs took that chance away from the Cards.  Oh and by the way The games changer was not Harrison's 100yd TD int return it was the inability of the cards secondary playing too soft of coverage in the final minute of the game.  Rookie corners need the help of a good safety unfortunately they have Aaron Francisco  47 who run 4.89 40yd at the combine last year. He can tackle but not run.  Cromartie was left out there hanging because of not safety support.  Just look at the defensive scheme simple cover 2.  You are all fools if you think Warner was at fault for this loss.|`|AA11448955	First off let me put my loyalties out. Seattle Seahawks... Nfc west rivals of Cardinals and losers of superbowl 40 against the Steelers. Obviously I was disappointed with both participants. The INT by Warner at the end of the first half, while it was a bad pass that led to the the TD was overcome there for not a big deal. The thing that cost them the game was the week defense they played in the finale drive.The Steelers picked them apart as if they were playing playground ball. The pass and catch  that gave the Steelers the lead was a beautiful play, however the DB was out of position and jumped early. Also there would have been more time on the clock because of the time it took to recover the football, not much but more. Do I think they would have scored ... I don't know. The Steelers would have done one of two things, blitz or play prevent d. Blitzing is dangerous because it leaves folks open if you see it fast enough, prevent d is also dangerous because only rushing three lets the qb have almost unlimited time in the pocket and eventual receivers get open. So 50-50 shot. However they won't ever let them replay that last bit of time. The game is in the books. But let us not forget the one way calls through most of the game. All in all I think it was a great game.

At that price its 100% cheap plastic and will break in a few games. Good for someone on a budget and just looking to have fun. If you want to rock your friends however I'd suggest...    http://www.hobbytron.com/AirsoftGunRifle...    or    http://www.hobbytron.com/ElectricSpecial...    Both decent guns, for a bit higher price.|`|Da3Rvlfoaa	Please, get this--a $89.99 electric MP5K, a good starter, I have been looking at it for a cheap secondary:  http://www.airsoftpost.com/matrix-galaxy...    Or, at the VERY LEAST, this: (I bought one for my uncle; it is surprisingly excellent for only $48)  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...
BpY2ed0Gaa	Right, there are two types of airsoft shottie which are shell fed, spring shotties and gas shotties.    With spring guns, the shells is simply a magazine like any other airsoft gun, just in the shape of a shotgun shell. You load the BB's into the 'shell', insert it into the shotgun and fire as normal. When empty, you remove the empty 'shell' and insert another...    Gas shotguns work differently. With gas shotguns, the shell holds a number of BB's (anywhere from 1-10) and one shot fires all the BB's in that shell. A number of shells are loaded into the gun in the same way as with a real shotgun, and emptied shells are ejected just like on a real shotgun.    With gas shotties, you only get as many shots as you have shells, with spring shotties, you get as many shots as the 'shell' magazine can hold...|`|U0Rvsabdaa	The same way an actual gun works. Go to a rifle range and ask them to show you.|`|Y4mz8BShaa	Gas shells are filled, and then firing causes the valve to open, forcing the gas out to propel the BB(s). Another way would be that the gas is stored in the airsoft gun itself (like with revolvers), and is forced out through the shell.    Spring shells, like you linked to, well...I have no idea.|`|L6w8YmoOaa	Airsoft guns dont need shells.|`|qIVUhnNtaa	OK FIRST AIRSOFT GUNS DONT NEED SHELLS!  but anyways real guns that use shells, the shells are sortof like ammunition holders and got gunpoweder at the back and launches out the bullet then the shell pops out...|`|K5QkVRGnaa	it depends on the gun like a m16 doesn't need shells were a sniper can use shells because they look cool, but you need shells for a grenade launcher. So to sum it all up you don't need shells unless you have a sniper or a grenade launcher.

Later on I will change my avatar to Chris Paul and username to "Williams gives me nightmares" in dedication of you.    Yes he is and that's why he is hating. Funny since no one even cares about them (except their fans).|`|vzYJJCdqaa	Betterr than being a kings fan..    but still..    GO KINGS!!  HAHAH..|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	Kinda sad aint it...    Some Laker fans show real respect while people like you keep hatin...  That's O.K.|`|MTbgg5eyaa	Who cares anyway?    We're all rooting for our team, of course we get the hate.  We have Kobe, Derek, Phil and Pau.    We have Bynum, Vujacic, Farmar, Odom, Radmanovic, Luke Walton.    We have the greatest franchise in the world.  We had Shaq, Wilt, Kareem, Magic, etc...    We don't care what others say.          We are 38-9.|`|PcxUNztLaa	Feels great.....        respect is Overrated.....          Kobe>MJ
wNqmyQAyaa	**** browns GO STEELERS ONLY TEAM WITH THE MOST SUPERBOWL WINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|T4vjAb9Caa	here we go stillers here we go|`|b9RZO159aa	My thoughts are:    Why do you have to ask this question?  Yes, the Steelers won. I think everyone gets it by now. You don't need to brag about it though, specifically to single out browns fans. Really, what difference does that make?    Have some class, man.    Edit: Love this question? Being a true Steeler fan doesnt mean you have to brag about winning the superbowl and expect every fan to agree with you.     Honestly, the last thing I want to be is come across as arrogant and a showoff.    I just like to be a little bit more down to earth and keep the bragging to myself.|`|8cDd70dSaa	Oh, so you have nothing better to do with your time? I'd just like to know what they expect to do to me with a towel. So menacing...LINENS!!!!! They're coming to get me!|`|CWu69yG8aa	i personally think you have no life for asking this question|`|MYCJZsAmaa	I love the Steelers man.  Proud to call myself a fan. =)
f239486529db7d21a3e718cc9dd9fedfaa	Very realistic trade great role players being traded but the system that these players are in are there best fits. so why would you trade them. Lakers would benefit with varejao because theyre front line is injury prone and delonte is a baller. cleveland would get the bad end of this with a potentially good point guard. vladimir is a shooter and plays decent defense. Lakers get the better end of this|`|uxregJ0faa	No thanks you guys cannot have Farmar|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	No! Not cool haired Anderson! His hair is awesome!  So sad!  I dont want those Laker Losers!|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	No. Why would you ever give up Delonte West?    EDIT: We don't want Farmar.|`|bjnPGBZyaa	why would the lakers want a leprechaun and sideshow bob?|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Hey I actually like that trade for my Lakes. LMAO at side show Bob.|`|LqQvCvLAaa	cavs 09 yes we can    who said you were on the team?|`|jDi45m0uaa	Delonte West is a sick player, i wouldn't trade him for Mihm,Radman or anyone.    Bad trade for cavs|`|EKF2HdZKaa	hell no  huge rip off for us  delonte gives us a good shooter,defender,guy who can create  andy gives us a guy who brings energy and does the dirty work for us (screens,offensive rebounds,etc)  plus these guys are a moajor part of our chemistry    Delonte>farmar  Delonte>radman  Andy>mihm|`|urqGJPwpaa	Love it.  I think for the Lakers, that trade is AMAZING.  Sure Farmar is a beast, but so is West.  Mihm is a 3rd string, who almost never plays, and Radmonovich doesn't really impress anyone.  I think it would help the Lakers, but it wouldn't happen.|`|zczneZ7baa	HELL ****.E.N NO
sMssDP1Xaa	There were two.  Harrison's interception for a TD at the end of the first half and Ben driving down the field with Santonio Holmes with minutes left to regain the lead and win.|`|gDKIxwRSaa	Fitzgerald scored a touchdown with only 2 and a half minutes left.. I think that motivated Big Ben to drive us down the field. Santonio caught a big pass then later scored the touchdown.  Steelers have heart.|`|2KIRdfIcaa	Holmes catches a pass at the end that I thought was out of bounds, however he had his to feet in the endzone while he caught it.|`|AA11562298	Big Ben on that last drive.  He wanted it more than anyone on that field.  By the way refs don't win or lose games, offense and defense does.|`|xPy6ZePkaa	It really wasn't a play it was Big Ben. Ben since college whenever the team was down by a few with just enough time for a come back. He would come out of no where and just be on fire and tear it up. He drove down the field and tossed it in to an OSU original Holmes and won the game.|`|T4vjAb9Caa	Pittsburgh's ahtstanding defense.  Holmes td|`|wNqmyQAyaa	steelers won by skill and teamwork|`|LV7Ggw3Raa	Steelers Suck Massive Balls, They Didn't Deserve to Win. "Big Ben" Is a disgrace, he's a cocky arogant biggot.|`|Roes9U61aa	defense James Harrison 100 yd int return for a td, and a last drive fumble by kurt warner. Santonio Holmes scored the game wining td.|`|QieK6XOOaa	There was 3:30 minutes left on the clock, Cards down by 4 due to a safety. They had to ball on the 40 and Larry Fitzgerald had a 50 some-odd touchdown catch/run. Then with about 3 minutes left Pitt had the ball and drove down and Holmes made a beautiful catch in the corner of the endzone dragging his feet in to make it. Then with 2 timeouts left Arizona had 30 seconds and burned them right away, and on the last play Kurt Warner fumbled. Giving Pitt the 27 - 23 win.|`|scdOQ2CAaa	Refs..
KhBmlaefaa	Because the Spurs are a mini-Dynasty. Same with all the teams you mentioned except the Yanks. They are just the face of baseball.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Oh brother.......|`|bjnPGBZyaa	because spurs have been the best team this last decade and the team that everyone wants to be|`|Zt1VDawZaa	Yall ready to lose to my Dubs!|`|WtcTBlccaa	spurs rule everyone knos it|`|4yiH5TiQaa	SPURS SUCK!|`|1gQnSsfHaa	hahaha thats so true
pANpZ3vaaa	yes it actually is a penalty.  The reason they called it, is because the holder is not blocking, so he is a defensless player and is vulnerable, just as the kicker!    And why the hell did he even run over the holder, most atheletes would go the other way while coming in for the block, that was stupid!  Its mistakes like this that cost arizona the game.    It was still an imature team and if warner plays next season, they will be awesome!|`|7qczKTv3aa	Yes, everyone knows it's a penalty. No I haven't seen it before because no player has been stupid enough to run into the holder (who is stationary!!!!!!).|`|a6EndAPiaa	Just because you have never heard of it does not mean it is not a rule.  What you think the NFL conspired to generate that rule just for this game?    The rule is the same for holders as it is for kickers and punters.  I have a vague memory of seeing it before but I am not sure.  When I saw the play I thought "yep that is a penalty alright".  How can you think that was NOT a penalty.  The holder is totally vulnerable and he was run into.    Sorry but there is no way that was NOT a penalty.  Stop looking for excuses to blame the refs.  That was an idiotic play by the defender.  If you want to be outraged be outraged at that player.  That was moronic beyond comprehension.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	Yes, I've seen it called before. The guy plowed into the holder, you can't hit an unprotected person!!!|`|e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	Given that the ball had already been kicked if was kind of an obvious penalty. The Steeler won so I don't see what you have to complain about. If it bothers you that they didn't cover the spread, then give up gambling.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	It is a rule, but it appeared the guy was blocked into the holder. Anyway it is a moot point because the Steelers still only came away with a FG.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	No, but I've never heard of anyone plowing over a holder like that either. That was extraordinarily dumb on his part. He deserved that call.|`|43f9Ctozaa	No. I don't know where the guy would have gone if he was running full speed and knew he couldn't run into the kicker.|`|MbcvI1A9aa	that is a penalty, but i know exactly what you mean when the refs are pulling strings for a steelers victory.|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	Yes, and its has been called four different times in superbowl history and called numerous times during the regular season.  The whole issue was that it occurred after the ball was kicked.  If the Cardinal had crashed into the holder in an attempt to block the kick, it would have not been called.  But since it was clear that not attempt to block the kick was made, because the ball had already crossed the line of scrimmage, it was called.  It is normally a dead ball foul.  It was called on Dallas, New England, and Miami.|`|SIqFa1mzaa	No.  How could he have done that?  I've seen people get penalties for running in to the kicker, but I've never seen someone run into the holder before.  What was he thinking?|`|2VGbJtnCaa	So what you are saying is that is was all right to smash the holder after the kick was gone?  Its just like running into the kicker! Put some more thought into your questions! You are JEALOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|lPDHMOVZaa	No. Last night was the first I had heard of it... though the penalty did not matter as the Steelers were still held to a field goal on that drive in the end.     I was getting frustrated with the officials in the 3rd quarter and was complaining with the best of them... though I have to say when the replays were shown the Cardinals clearly committed the penalties that were called. The refs did a good job in the game and while I can understand why people are calling them into question, I think they called the game fairly.     Though I can't understand why the Warner "fumble" on the last play of the game was not reviewed...     FYI - I was cheering for the Cardinals last night.|`|YYBzl7Yhaa	A punter, placekicker, or holder who simulates being roughed by a defensive player.|`|UqWIh5tAaa	No because most players aren't dumb enough to run right into a holder like that.|`|B0pEnhpBaa	If you watch the replay the Pittsburgh guard blocked/pushed him into the holder
01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	yah find out how long cp3 will be then assess|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	your assists will drop heavily....find out how long paul is out for first.....but i would get jefferson over gasol and not jason rich but maybe allen iverson.|`|uj6v5MWBaa	i dont think u should do it because cp3 gets all your assists bascly and u dont need al jeferson for rebounding because of dwight howard    i would do the trade but I hope u can replcace him|`|COGNhhYFaa	no, im not willing to give corey maggette. also, i didn't say i would switch al jeff to gasol.|`|lRotJdEWaa	dont trade cp3 no matter what.  i will be a big mistake.|`|KHUtnMI1aa	CP3 is the only guy on your team that gets you assists so if you trade him away i guess all you want to win in is the points category
qCrlOrYmaa	Tony Parker or Derrick Rose.   Parker has so much skill and so much experience, but Rose could be the best thing to ever come out of Chi-Town.  Hey, don't count the other two out tho ;).  Should be a great night|`|sCHUFUXsaa	i heard that jameer got injured.  wish deron replaces him.    dont he need to defend his title?  last time, wade won, he defends it the next year  also like the other guys did, like nash..|`|bjnPGBZyaa	i expect tony parker to win it|`|tBuzrlSdaa	I havent watched Skills Challenge before and dont really know what it is but I think Tony Parker will win whatever it is lol  Edit: I read your link I still think Parker will win or Rose|`|GBGcI509aa	It would have been nice to see a Wade addition.|`|NzS7yD32aa	Well nelson got injured today so he might be replaced

He's not NEARLY as big as The Rock was. I can't see Santino going face anytime soon (even though I like him), but he has been getting face pops lately, so you  never know. But he wont be as big as Rock was.|`|mBDIniTxaa	Yes...it came out Jan 27th i have it...      The only way he'll be like him is the way you've said and being funny..he'll never be a main eventer or anything.|`|e3m3rdNYaa	he is not there yet, but he is a really good wrestler so  he may get there    BQ: it came out last Friday, I bought it on Saturday...

Dont take it personally...lol|`|BIyJUmM9aa	If your a real Knicks fan  you shouldn't be ashamed    =]]|`|lwDz2bE8aa	im a knicks fan and honestly   they need new ownership   ranaldo baukman was the worst choice ever in the history of the nba|`|uFqkgwhQaa	Im from NY and i must say, Tonight was spectacular!  Great game from the knicks even though we lost.    Watching history was well worth it|`|tnqO91xoaa	LMAO     who wouldn't?
1jmXT4Vvaa	The x7 has three advantages over the a5.  First it has a magnesium body that is stronger and lighter.  Second it has an improved version of the cyclone hopper.  Third, it looks much cooler.  OK, the third was a stretch, but I like the styling better.  I own a x7 with a freak barrel, collapsable stock, e grip, and hpa.  No one will ever be able to convince me it's not the best marker on the market.  Everyone that has shot it, has either upgraded to a x7, or is saving money to make the swap.|`|QTd8MVDjaa	Honestly, the A-5 is pretty much the same thing as the X-7. The X-7 has the roughly the same internals and has the same hopper system as the A-5. The only thing different is the mil-sim stuff on the X-7. I'd go for the A-5 and use the extra money to upgrade it with a barrel. The G3 is better, but the A-5 is still a great gun and needs minimal maintenance and is more simply made than the G3. You won't need to baby the A-5, but you'll need to clean and lube it eventually (like any gun, just not as much). The G3 is more complicated and harder to take apart and fix. Hope this helps!|`|QcmNHRzyaa	the G3 is better than both of the tippmanns
7WFrijvhaa	i think it was a FUMBLE;   GO STEELERS !! wooo ! :))|`|RZIV15e3aa	Fumble. Dont listen to Cardinal fans. They are still just crying that their team failed.|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	i think it was incomplete, but even if Warner had one more play, what are the chances of him throwing it up in the end zone and someone coming down with it. You know 8 guys will be waiting for it and i dont care who you are, i dont think you can catch it. Steelers made the plays when needed and won the game.|`|uGsvU3GCaa	incomplete he still pushed the ball out himself|`|erEd506Vaa	i accidently fumbled..........................|`|rDmlKoRQaa	It was ruled a fumble and that is how it will be for the rest of history.    Do I agree with that call, no, but thats how it goes.|`|Awj0UKSaaa	incomplete pass|`|srIvu5PWaa	it was a fumble and they did official review.|`|Sk8Oy7uEaa	INCOM-EFFIN-PLETE    HIS ARM WAS MOVING FORWARD, AND THAT LINEMAN DIDNT EVEN HIT THE BALL, HE HIT KURT WARNERS ARM AND WARNER THREW IT|`|RMppfinbaa	FUMBLE|`|32E2SvPAaa	i would say interception fumble|`|S2EagBzOaa	not a fan of either team, but I think his arm was going foward and the ball was still in his hand so I'd say incomplete pass    btw to Steelers fans Green Bay Packers 12 Titles, Pittsburgh Steelers 6 titles, congratulations your franchise is now half as successful as the Green Bay Packers|`|rzkFHAEJaa	there were two. first was a pass, second a fumble.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	I hope the NFL changes this stupid tuck rule. Make it like it used to be, it the the QB loses the ball it's a fumble. The refs have a hard of enough time as it is with some of this judgment call rules.
ZtZqtYA8aa	he was being a douche|`|7f2GSDmqaa	No. They never do. They  just say it too add to the match to make the character sound more interesting. I used to think that too LOL|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Cole is an idiot. I don't pay attention to anything he says. He makes a big deal about everything. "Oh look King he's taking a whizz!"|`|dU4fwRoqaa	made up,Cole "Talks To Everyone Earlier Today" Yet He Never Talks To Anyone While RAW is In Progress. If There Going to Cut An Interview/Promo May as well do it on-screen|`|u02JAANXaa	It's all storyline|`|B9h6VhQOaa	if you notice they ALWAYS say that  "i talked to Batista earlier and he said there's no way he's gonna lose his title" It's BS. i get annoyed when they say it because it is not true. they don't go around talking to every wrestler on a show and ask them about their match. ya it seems like cole does it most of the time. i know its not real but they push that a lot.|`|7BS1L0oBaa	i'd say that it is fake because why would people wanna talk to Michael Cole or the other announcers
dfBwVxXFaa	I would be more worried about ticks than flees.  But as posted by someone else, the bugs seem to look for a different host after the blood stops flowing.  I have rarely found flees and ticks on my game by the time I got home.|`|gWMBy2HMaa	poop on it firstto kill the flees.|`|svbFM4Zyaa	I have never had a rabbit with flees on it. I guess that is pretty weird. I have also never had squirrel with flees on it either. Maybe you should hunt somewhere outside of the city. Just a small tip.|`|Ehgn3ZvFaa	boil it thats what i always do|`|a243bdff28f8938b1553bc0befe479d8aa	Boil it. Maybe even steam it(if you have a steam cleaner), haven't tried the second technique but it probably would work. But the first definitely will.|`|vea6mqPZaa	I use dusting sulfur.    Sprinkle a little on it and watch the eviction go smoothly|`|68c1d5b1f14b95ec630477c10b85baefaa	The two suggestions above will get rid of the fleas but you will then be boiling a whole rabbit guts and all.    I never got fleas from any of the game I dressed. Once the blood stops flowing, the vermin feeding on that blood tend to leave anyway.    Clean your game in the field to avoid the chance of bringing fleas and ticks home with you. That also provides a free meal to coyotes, fox, buzzards etc...    Oh yeah, try to keep the rabbits from rubbing against your clothing while you carry them from the field.|`|3Twg9Uuuaa	I always carry a little bottle of mint oil and rub it on my hands before dressing any game. It keeps the bugs off of me and hides the smell of the game. I too have rarely seen bugs on squirrels or rabbit, but big game has always been a problem with ticks and such. There are also over the counter bug repellents you can get in the pet department that are organic and will not harm the game for consumption. sage also is a natural bug repellent try that.|`|ZMQMCzlmaa	I just pull the fur by the feet and then pull the fur up and over the head basically turning it inside out.  You barely have to touch the fur and can avoid the fleas.  Gut it and then wash your hands. You should be fine.  Rabbits do often carry fleas.  I was in the arctic and they often had fleas. No ticks there.|`|TEAKcA5Laa	first of all, the fleas on a rabbit won't stay on a human. second, as the rabbit carcass cools, the fleas will vacate on their own. no worries.
uxregJ0faa	To be honest .No I really can't see them beating them in a 7 game series. Orlando slaughtered them. But who knows they might put up a better fight in the playoffs.|`|25ymUKdraa	Im a Magic fan, and if this would happened, ill hope the magic is on target with their 3pt shooting.     i think the cavs can win over the magic in a game 7 but you can not deny the maturity if the magic, esp j.nelson. game 7 between magic and cavs will be entertaining and will be a close fight|`|wsZz2ptmaa	Definitley:  i think the lakers r the best in the nba ( by the way im not a lakers fan)  But i thnk the cavs or the spurs will win it|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	They probably could, coz LeBron is beast!  And anyways Dwight Howard is awesome, but LeBron is a team leader!  And some of the Cavs have cool hair =D   Like da one that had to get stitches  He had cool hair!  And ya, the Cavs have enough power to win!  Go Cavs!|`|zFpHpqiLaa	it's lyk the cavs do outstanding during the season but i can see them losing to orlando i hope they go all the way and then lose to the hornets|`|khbLZQHIaa	You're forgetting a couple important details.    The Cavs had two missing starters in that Orlando game.  Not only that but they were on a mini-slide.  Now, the playoff series?  No way, now how.    Have you ever SEEN the Cavs in the playoffs?  Wow, they really are a much better team.  They're starting to get built like the Spurs, don't think too much in the regular season but once the playoffs come around, go all out.  It's what the Cavs are made for.|`|XEWs07Wxaa	The Cavaliers wouldn't let the Magic win 3 games out of that series    Cav's win 4 - 2    Unpredictable Offensive Schemes vs Unbreakable Defense|`|o9F9iJ8eaa	cavs can def beat the magic in a 7 game series, im not saying it would be easy but they are more than capable of doing it. especially with a healthy delonte west. jameer nelson is gonna be the weak link the cavs can exploit and the magic bench|`|pCNt1hBbaa	i dont know how they would stop dwight howard other than that there better
t07nu5euaa	I just want to clarify.  The "Six-burgh" Steelers are not at the top of the championship mount.  Not by half.  The Green Bay Packers have 12 championships.  Followed by the Bears (9) and Giants (7).  Pittsburgh is a respectable 4th.  Why do you think it is called the "Lombardi Trophy"?|`|OFi3jBSHaa	Because Point Park University's in Pittsburgh.|`|zmRfnPomaa	I personally love the Steelers , winners or losers !!    its probably because I'm from Pittsburgh :)|`|HNE7dJQiaa	were so sick of them winning ;)|`|9M8lEQDqaa	I don't hate the steelers. At least the Cowboys can't brag about having the most anymore.|`|nr6KBe8Naa	cause they are all jealous that the steelers are the number 1 team in the whole NFL with 6 SUPERBOWL WIns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOO|`|pANpZ3vaaa	Hey Mike,  If you notice, haters are just haters man!    They hate on every successfull team!  They have no clue about what the team went through to get to the superbowl and win!    They only care about complaining!  Even when there is no reason to complain, they still do!      The cardinals fought really hard and earned a lot of respect, but when it comes down to it, steelers where a better team because they play for each other and are more matured!     They faced a lot of hardship all season long and survived through it all to win the superbowl!  They deserve the win.    Not taking anything aways from the cards though!  See these haters just dont understand what the team is all about!  They always want to hate on a team, and dont even know why they are hating!|`|CnPuuKHLaa	they have only won 6. If your team wants the ring then play like you want it. better men won last nite. Great game. Go Steelers!!!|`|2VGbJtnCaa	You are just JEALOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...
HNE7dJQiaa	change your avatar please, i wanna barf|`|xxtvhn5Naa	I think he will probably be back with the Cardinals one more year.  Maybe two.  Then they will probably hand over the starting QB spot to Matt Leinart.  Once that happens, Warner will probably retire.|`|f9d88043d8ba88ae6d8cec415fe76179aa	I imagine if Kurt Warner plays next year it will be as a Cardinal.  I really cannot see him going to another team will poor pass blocking like the Rams.|`|pANpZ3vaaa	If Arizona resigns him and gives him a decent pay (what he deserves!!!) he will come back for another year.

J74Y5LKxaa	I am a fan of neither team, but was rooting for the Cardinals (since they were the underdog).  But all in all I thought it was an incredible game!  It got boring there until the end of the 3rd quarter.  But all in all a great game that was a lot more exciting than I thought it would be.  But I think the Steelers played a LOT dirtier.  Especially after the replay of that one Steeler hitting the Cardinal.  Even John Madden thought the guy should have been ejected.  But two challenges resulting in two over turned calls?   Makes you wonder!     PS:  Why was the last play of the game not reviewed?  An extra 5 seconds is all the Cardinals would have needed for a successul hail marry!|`|gDKIxwRSaa	Um.. were we watching the same game?  Both teams fought hard but the Steelers fought a little harder.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Not I.|`|nr6KBe8Naa	are you kidding me!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! THEY DESERVED IT AND THEY WANTED IT!!!!!! SO THEY GOT IT!!! YEAHHHHH|`|HNE7dJQiaa	cheated? how so?    they won fair, * cough not like the superbowl against the hawks cough*|`|xxtvhn5Naa	it was just luck in my opinion|`|d5q8PvPuaa	They won a fair game, however the ref's could've done a better job in some key areas.  The last play should've been reviewed and some of the Cardinals penelties shouldn't have been called for being incidental.  However, this had nothing to do with what the Steelers did.|`|4v0bhxsIaa	The Steeler's did not cheat they played ball and won!  Yes there were some poor calls|`|CnPuuKHLaa	why is everybody such a hater. Get over it the team who wanted it more won.|`|pANpZ3vaaa	Only the haters ask these type of questions!     I bet this idiot asked this question the last time the pats won their third superbowl!    I bet he asked this question every time someone besides his team won the superbowl!     These people make me sick!  They dont even look at the other team's performance or how much they put into the season.  They just want something to complain about!|`|Mlkd5Ig4aa	First of all, who are the "stelelers"?  I believe the Super Bowl was between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Arizona Cardinals.  Please use spell check next time.    Secondly, how did they cheat?  If you thought they cheated, please explain.    Thirdly, both teams played an incredible game.  It just so happens the Steelers fought a little harder than the Cardinals did.|`|AA11562298	Cardinals lost it, thankfully.  Big Ben was amazing on the last drive.|`|MbcvI1A9aa	combination of both.|`|7qczKTv3aa	Idiots might believe so I guess.|`|EvDoLydgaa	they clearly cheated
RC3WoqFkaa	win 6-4 or around 6-3. hit balls at a normal pace. don't hit fast ones often, but once in a while. hit the balls so u move the other person, but don't completely control the point.|`|o3mRIWC0aa	I would give him a couple games... that is just me. Or at the beginning I would tell myself to work on the weak spot of my game. Or I would tell him that I was going to play like a certain type of player... I don't know.|`|5275143cee08e7afc9aecdb3d2c7df7caa	For a set, use a handicap system where the lower player (your student) receives free points that they can use any time (must be stated before the serve of the point).  The number of free points should be that the final score has the stronger player winning at 6-4 for a set (winning more than 4 is an achievement meaning they have improved).  Adjust the number or points up and down over time so that this will occur.    Also being the coach, try and play solid but don't go all out unless evenly matched.  Play reasonably so the player gains game experience and overall work on their game.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	Why do you have to play a set? Dont make it to competitive. Just play him in practice points, and make sure you play hard, so he can learn from you.

4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	I know i agree with you completely there the guy was just so entertaining in the past regardless of being a heel or a face. Yeah i wish he would stop complaining and start making fun of people again cause it is quite funny. Every time i see his entrance these days he just walks and does nothing. He barely shows his mic skill these days but i still say he's one of the best wwe has today. Seriously Jericho save us from this boredom|`|7f2GSDmqaa	It's his gimmick. He's more serious now than he used to be. Who said he's still not a great wrestler? He still puts on great matches when hes in the ring, its just his promos are kind of monotone, but like I said, thats his new character. Hes grown from his metalhead gimmick he used to have.|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	Jerichooo is awsome and he is not boring he will be boring if he turns good and do nothing else but fight than that would be boring..

When he came back he called Orton a Robot and now he has become one himself.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	He had personality before ande the fans didn't even react well to him, even in his return he didn't get a big reaction or as big as he should have. SO he turned heel and fans have been raving about him ever since, which shows me that this "boring" Jericho gimmick is working.|`|QQyWUDI8aa	i do not know

4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	Like all highschool sports expect to meet some new friends, learn healthy competition, and playing as a part of a team.  All you need to prepare for this are practice, a good attitude, and the desire to work with your coach/teamates to get better.      As for a tournament you will learn competition, the rules of competitive golf, and how to play in the spirit of golf.  You will get the hang of that after a couple of tournies.  Good luck, and all the best.|`|ayLYuIvOaa	well it depends on who do you guys have on the team  my school girls team is horrible  all you have to do is hit a golf ball and you are on the team  lol  many score like 50-70 for 9holes!!!|`|F65Km3Coaa	im in it now and its preety fun|`|c6e27c95665b88eb530af3016ff35c59aa	hi. im a sophomore in high school so i can probably give you a heads up about what to expect. first of all, how old are you? because breaking 90 and shooting 70's are two completely different things. it takes at least 2-3 years to be able to consistently shoot 70's when you're shooting 90's now. but ok, anyways, you need to get into tournaments outside of school. high school golf is good but for real experience you need to get into AJGA tournaments (American Junior Golf Association). High school golf is pretty laid back depending on your coach. My coach is not very good and most high school coaches arent, so its important to try and find a professional to take lessons from.  High school golf is fairly easy, and tournament play is like playing a normal round. most high school golf girls aren't very good and tend to talk alot so you shouldn't have to worry about feeling uncomfortable with a very serious golfer. However, if this does happen, just try and keep conversation shorter.  Believe me, as a freshman i found out the hard way, a girl just ignored me, lol. I would definitely get involved in tournaments outside of school though, its very important if you're planning on playing golf in college.  Practice practice practice, and perhaps the 70's will come :)|`|GJjZ4cEPaa	The one thing you should do is manage your expectations.  Pretty much every golfer will tell you what they SHOULD be doing or what they SHOULD have shot.  What matters in tournament golf is what you do shoot.  No one cares what you should have shot.  So, concentrate on breaking 90, then breaking 85, then hopefully you can break 80.    Tournament golf is completely different from regular course play.  Play in as many tournaments as you can.  As another answer suggested, play in the AJGA tournaments.  The best preparation is to play in as many tournaments as you can.  I disagree with another answer however about it being just like playing with friends or it's a normal round, don't gab with your playing partners.  Concentrate on your game.  It's good to be cordial, but focus is key to golf, especially tournament golf|`|JSGLKnA4aa	if you do really well you'll get a diploma!!! how's thaty for a going away present.|`|wtjb0UuXaa	Yeah mate i agree with a lot of people here. High school isn't really competitive unless your school is really good. I'm on varsity girls and we never practice, and some players shoot over one hundred. If you want to start, you should see what the girls are shooting at the school you're going to and try to match the best.
caczNImxaa	i dont think it was suppose to be someone spying. i think it was to show the fans  that they were planning something.|`|BglekVnQaa	It was just cameraman.

Teams success comes from off-season.|`|RZIV15e3aa	football season was over weeks ago when the Eagles were unfairly eliminated.

JwgWzFa1aa	they are teammates and respect each other so i dont think they have any real problems, although pato was still left out. the commentator said that sometimes u have to be selfish, but kaka's first shot it would have been easier for him to pass it to pato. the second shot was harder but he still finished it.     i think kaka felt that he had to redeem himself for the first miss, though he couldve done that by redeeming himself to pato for not passing it to him in the first place. i feel that kaka probably shouldve passed it the second time, seeing that he missed the first one due to selfishness.     i honestly dont think they despise each other or anything, but i could really see that from kaka's second shot where he scored, pato didn't get all that excited. if anything i think he was quite upset with kaka that he didnt pass it with 2 clear opportunities. i saw that he wasn't happy about kaka's decision, but i still dont believe that theres a real problem.     i dont think that it had to do with the fact that pato was scoring all the goals, although i honestly believe that there would be more team chemistry and passion between the game played of them two if kaka had given it to pato on those 2 chances.     pato seemed disinterested afterwards and didnt celebrate with him. i sort of felt sorry for him because he did the hard work in putting himself in the right position for the pass, and the second shot was a big risk, and even though it paid off, it wasnt worth it because it was only an individual effort.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	They do NOT have problems. Kaka wanted the goal. Simple. He usually scores on the occasion the goalie got there before him and when he hit the post but he didn't. Then he scored a goal, hardly his fault. Kaka and Pato link well.     In fact when the whole Man City saga was going on Pato sent a text to Kaka saying "Ricky don't go, together we will win the Scudetto" and Kaka this week said he is the next Balon D'Or. Not only that, they DID celebrate the goal together. You can see pics of Kaka with Beckham and Pato either side of him after the goal.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNJGs1gTj...    ^ ^ ^ Evidence. Check out second 00:51|`|LhCGU3F1aa	I doubt it. I personally think they are the two best players of Milan right now. Honestly, would you rather try to score your self, or have your team mate doing it? Sure you'll get an assist, but a goal is always better, no? Kaka isn't jelous hunny, get it out of your head. They are from the same country, and currently play for the same country why would they hate? Its like saying that Ronaldo and Quaresma hate each other.. they dont.|`|p4H61jQDaa	dont know about that seeing as I usually watch milan games but i dont think kaka is that kind of guy|`|7DwKjkMWaa	NO PATO AND KAKA GET ALONG PERFECTLY, SOMETIMES YOU SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY ON THE FIELD THAN OFF THE FIELD, IT MIGHT HAVE LOOKED THAT PATO WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR WHEN U WATCH IT ON TV, BUT SOMETIMES WHEN YOUR PLAYING YOU SEE THINGS DIFFERENT.|`|A4W6YLS0aa	Kaka did have two chances to pass to Pato.

I think we all would be pretty excited if the Cardinals would have won, and it would be worth the wait until next season, but no big deal that the Steelers won, how boring, another championship...ugghhh!!!
v9cORzzfaa	Australia, Brazil and Croatia.    England fans arent the best... they are too fanatical. The question is the best fans, not the craziest fans.

Obviously WWE was worried about Orton not getting heat on the air as he is a St. Louis native.      I wondered why Orton was getting so much heat when he came out to confront Shane McMahon in the opening segment. WWE understands that this is very important to setup the continuing McMahon angle to WrestleMania and they didn't want to take a chance of letting the hometown crowd mess up Orton's heat.|`|Be6HpTuoaa	he wants to stay in character which i respect a lot of someone that is true to the game. He is not mad he's acting. Afterwords he is just going to party and sign some othographs with his beloved fans in his hometown. Hope this helps :)|`|eGCWuY4raa	I think that he was in shock that anyone would actually cheer for him.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	He works hard to get boos not cheered.. But I still love him..|`|7f2GSDmqaa	They shouldn't be cheering him. He's a heel. If they cheer him he's not doing his job well enough.

hlqj0pvxaa	I taught at a YMCA for a while and parents had to buy the uniforms.     They were the cheapest ones available - and I mean in quality, and they charged $25.     Thing is, I have an account and bought them for about $14 for the parents.     I guess it depends if the YMCA branch is hungry or not.    Edit:    The reason I left is because they expected me to modify my teaching method to be more "recreational", as NOhioGuy suggested. I refused to do it and gave them my resignation.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	First off if you really want to learn karate you should not be asking for something for free. You have to earn everything at a good school and if it costs money then you should pay it.    Secondly I would not recommend too many YMCA programs. There are a few out there that are decent but most of them are a recreational based karate style of class. I would recommend you find a real dojo to train at.    Third, if you are looking to get something for nothing then you do not belong in a real karate school anyway. Everyone has to pay their fair share and buy their own equipment. If you really wanted to train and learn karate you would find a way to do it.    I paid for my karate from the age of 8 until I began teaching on my own. This included dues, uniforms, exams, gear and events. Unlike most other people out there I never owned a video game, wasted money on the most fad clothes or shoes and was dedicated. When people really want something they cut out things that are not needed in their life to pay for it....karate should be no different.    Parents today complain about authentic karate costing anywhere from $60 to $99 a month but yet they run out and buy, or worse give their kid the money to buy, video games and other things do nothing to help them.     Pay your way, earn your skills and join a real school. This is the true way to learn properly.

obPSaYf3aa	I think that he put some extra "english" on the ball during release and when the ball hit a spot on the midlane that probably was bone dry with no oil on it, it started moving in the opposite direction.  There may not be another explanation other than manipulating the oil or lack thereof.  I can't imagine camera tricks or placing transparent ramps/blocks to change the ball's direction because I've witnessed the trick done by fellow PBA bowlers messing around after a tournament block by entertaining the fans.|`|AA10462002	Lmaoo.... I never heard of him, and I watch the ESPN fairly regularly.  I do miss a lot since after church we usually hang around the coffee shop and get home too late but I usually catch the end and i watch as often as I can.    Anyways, I thought maybe he was a new rookie, since up to a year or 2 ago, I watched more religiously and new every bowler on circuit.  Anyways, I just went on youtube and looked him up.  Now, I don't feel so dumb not knowing him since he is a much older bowler.    First video I clicked on with him showed him doing this trick shot.  BTW, the way you explained it just sounded like a normal lefty hook.  To anyone else who may read this let me clarify, it was a double hook, meaning it started on the left side of the lane, hooked to the right gutter, than hooked back to the left gutter, and finally hooked to the 10 pin on the right side of lane!!!!    I found this absoulutely amazing myself, and don't quite understand how it's possible either.  What makes this even more amazing, is back then they didn't rely on big hooks like today.  They threw urethane or maybe even rubber balls, depending on the year this was done, not sure exactly how old this is.  Neither of these balls were designed to hook, like today's particle resin coverstock.  Of course you can force a hook on any ball, but still...  And to do it double like that....  IDK how he did it, but I was utterly amazed at watching it.  I'm guessing speed had something to do with it, cuz it was thrown really slow.  I'd imagine faster and it wouldn't have time to hook like that.      Oh, and he did the flying eagle!!!!!  I'd luv to see him and barnes go head-to-head :-)

Z0UyjCS3aa	i dint know any routines but you should do things like; bench presses, elevated bench press, core workout, calf raises, squats, dead lifting, and any other thing that has to do with weights. Im doing that right now for high school football. They have us do weight training for them and thats most of the stuff they make us do. Youll do running during the season so you might not to need to worry about that as much as your strength. hope this helps.

Wu0XyNspaa	By throw...you mean set or dump?    The first choice of all setters is to obviously set to the hitters. Although, if the pass is really close to the net, or the setter is wanting to throw the other teams defense off guard, you can dump the ball. It's almost like a tip, but the setter takes their left hand (even if you're right handed) and flicks the ball downward into the middle of the court. Just make sure that you go up with both hands, so it looks like you're going to set. Or you can go a very light backset right over the net so that it just passes the plane of the net and lands in the other teams left front corner. I taught my setter how to do this and we won the point every single time!|`|XxGB4eGyaa	supposed to pass it to the hitter|`|FFh7x8a1aa	If you have been in a volley and its just not going anywhere or you just want to throw the other team off go ahead and trick them out a little usually works. but you don't want to go right to someone else is try to put the ball in a position that would be hard for the player to get to.
NvaK57Phaa	you're not going to explode overnight. just make sure you are getting your proper rest (8-10 hours), you are working out, and you eat other high protein things such as lean meats, peanuts, peanut butter, and dairy products. if you stay disciplined and focused, you should start seeing results in about 3-4 days. try only one for about 2 weeks and then afterwards if you are not satisfied, go for two, but make sure you dont overdo it. it can have negative effects if you arent careful!|`|YUXvCttVaa	Take both for better results.

Yes, taking a knee is a run by the quarterback, I could not agree with you any more. I hate when I have to take a knee on madden and it hurts my Qb avg yards per rush, and I hate that spiking a ball is an incomplete pass, should just be a dead ball play. And I'm and Eagles fan so I love that play lol    If you are a true NFL Quarterback you would not care at all

AA10241450	For running 120 heart beats per minute is used for interval training and is where you would want your heartbeat to drop in order to do your next fast run or interval.  120 is considered recovery heart rate or the rate you should walk allowing your heart rate to drop for your cool down and enough so you can stop your workout.      Cardio zone is your aerobic training area and is considered marathon pace or pace where you can comfortably talk with a friend.  Each person's aerobic zone is different depending on training, genetics and by their heart rate but is generally under 70% of your maximum heartbeat.  Yor maximum heartbeat is generally around 220 - your age.  To calculate your aerobic zone just take 60% through 70% of your maximum heart rate.  Fat burning is better at slower speeds or work because it teaches your body to use fat rather than sugar in your workouts.  Fast workouts your body will use sugar or creatine phosphate in order to run at high intensity.      Aerobic jogging  you generally want to run past 60 minutes in order for your body to develop your runners lungs and heart.  Try to gradually increase your times 10% per week especially as you perform.  Don't dispair as you get better it will be easier to train and you can always increase the speed or add interval training to vary your workouts.      Again train around 60% to 70% of your maximum heart rate for aerobic running for maximum fat burning - again the pace should be fairly easy as the lbs shed - you can later train at a higher intensity 70 to 80% especially if your training for a 5K or 10K race.      You can also train periodically with short bursts of up to 85% for 10 to 30 seconds for anaerobic training every mile.  This will help increase your strength and speed.  Also fast walking in the beginning is a good fast burning workout - just remember you need to go at least 40 minutes however keep increasing the time as you progress.  Good luck with your training and learn to use periodization or track your miles and workouts.  Those that plan and track will generally lose more wt than those that don't.|`|fibXDLy6aa	Cardio Zone is when you get a good cardio workout and it helps you get faster. There is also a mode that is fat burn, the bpm will be lower. The lower bpm is low, but you have to do it longer. Fat burn is generally lower impact on your body, but you end up working for a longer time. Hope that is what you're looking for.

z28L84Cjaa	I don't believe he was a crybaby or a sore loser.    Playing a tough match, particularly a close match (and any 5 setter qualifies as a close match), with such high stakes is going to be highly emotional for anyone.  You don't often see players cry after a match because they get to leave the court right after.  In the championship, that is not an option, so the players are forced to try and maintain the best they can.    In Federer's case, there was a great deal of pressure to prove he was back in form.  He is one slam away from Sampras's record, and that is something that was repeated over and over again, in commentary and in interview questions.  And, no matter how you look at it, the past glory is not likely to make it easier to deal with a loss like this.. it makes it tougher because you already know what that victory feels like.    I cannot say that it didn't take something from Nadal's victory, and perhaps it was a bit unfair, but there is a lot more going into Federer's emotions.  Every elite player understands the joy of a hard fought victory, but they understand just as well the emotional turmoil that comes with defeat.      The gratitude and appreciation of what Federer has achieved in the sport will come later.  For now, his disappointment, frustration, and sadness are understandable. Just like the Wimbledon final, the pride of being part of such an epic match will come in time.      You are correct.. Nadal's reaction was incredibly touching.  Like he said in a later interview, I think that mentally he [Federer] made such a mountain of it that he came crashing down, but that can happen to anybody.    So many players have cried in the shower after a tough match.  Federer's turn unfortunately came in a public forum.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	He lost a Grand Slam Final, do you expect him to be happy|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no he is not cry baby|`|ppwUMCBJaa	i do! He's a cry baby and a sour loser.|`|Zz4FGiAEaa	How would you feel if you lost such an important match?  Wouldn't you cry? He deserves to cry once in a while, he is number two in the world.  Give the poor guy some slack.|`|3g2ng8Ksaa	I also felt bad for him at first, but then I realized that he is sort of a cry baby.|`|QPZRuiomaa	Federer is real big boy with ordinary man'passion sad sorrow and also happy enthusastic...I love him more after the crying happened for his blue and his unique career story that"slip by the 14 slam grand record" touched me so deep!!! He cries for reasonable emotion.  I 'll always support him ,share the happiness of the victory and the pain of losing  and walk  on the twist road with him!!!!|`|6711ee59670349069d4cb430e0c2df59aa	I think he was upset about not tying Sampras for 14 titles and he knows he will have to work hard to tie or pass Sampras.    I think it was awkward for Nadal and everyone up there.  It was really surprising and I felt for him.      Athletes have a lot on their plate (and get paid well because of it).  The possibility for let down is great in their life.|`|iDAeBNA4aa	NO  I do not think he was a cry baby.  It was a very emotional time for him.  There is nothing wrong with a man crying.  In fact it is quite courageous for a man to cry.  All this nonsense taught to boys about they must not cry is ludicrous.    It was  a great match and they are both great guys.    Who knows how you would react put in that situation. I doubt that you will ever know.  Do not be so mean.|`|34be5cac64eb401bf49e120d984bc8adaa	NO. I probably dropped any chance there of a best answer, but I feel I need to say WHY I think so. This was a huge match for Federer, who hoped to tie Pete Sampras' record, which would be a huge achievement for him. Throughout the Aussie Open, a bunch of critics jeered at him, and practically claimed that his career was over when it took him a comeback from two sets down against Berdych. I don't remember verbatim, but Federer himself felt that it wasn't fair how everyone thought "OH NO!" after he had to come back against Berdych, but how everything was hunky-dory once he defeated del Potro.    Under so much stress and criticism, it was his night to prove them wrong, and Federer shouldered the burden. Furthermore, he had lost to Nadal over and over again, adding to the stress. Federer took on a load of stress and the like when he played Nadal that day, and he, in the end, lost. And cried...just a little. So what? It's not like he broke into tears and started sobbing raucously or anything.    Not only that, Federer held on for 5 grueling sets which totaled almost five hours (if I remember correctly), only to...lose. This would be a blow to you and me as well, wouldn't it?    Continuing your comparison about how he should be grateful and not have cried, each one of us would have given everything to BE at the Australian Open as well! How much would we give to be able to play in the finals of the Australian Open, and not only that, tie the record of one of the best tennis players ever? To just live that match, to be included in that match, to WIN that match, is something that I personally would give an arm and a leg for; not to have a great record as a great tennis player.    Call me "a bit of a baby" for it, but I would have cried too if I were Federer.|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	ppl who agree are nadal fans|`|02d0dbba77861d90576aef0958f8bca9aa	This question really is getting old, but for the last time the answer is NO.  He was not a "crybaby."    You people act as if Federer is the first athlete to ever cry in front of the public.  Athletes cry all the time.  Ever watch the Superbowl or the NBA finals?  Tell me you've never seen any of the athletes crying after a win or a loss.    Athletes are very serious about what they do.  They spend their lives preparing for tournaments.  They dedicate most of their waking hours to working out, doing drills, improving their craft.  Is it any surprise if they cry tears of joy after a win or tears of agony after a loss???    Do you see those tennis players who hurry off the court after a painful loss?  I'm willing to bet it's because they can feel the tears coming and they want to get to the locker room before the tears overflow.  Well, Federer didn't have the luxury of hiding, ok.  Just cut the guy some slack.    BIG BOYS CRY.  REAL MEN CRY.  If you have never felt the urge to cry, SEEK THERAPY.  Women, if your man has trouble crying, you're in for a rocky relationship.|`|ZtGETjNkaa	i dont agree with you and i was also crying with him|`|U83jqEJaaa	"PUNK 12300"    Roger actually said , 'God its killing me'|`|IMwvaKkKaa	Roger first didn't cry when he lost. You can tell he was still fine before the speech. When he stood on the box, the crowd started cheering and screaming things like "I love you Roger". That killed it right there, it triggered his emotions and he broke down. He even said "You guys are killing me" cuz they were cheering like crazy and all that. Yes of course he is sad when he had this great chance, Nadal's worst surface, and not be able to tie Sampras' record. No of course he's not a crybaby, athletes cry all the time.|`|w8fP7aBNaa	federer is a crybaby, his mommy didnt change his diapers, he did a poopoo! he lost to rafa, so he cry!|`|dk8y4eseaa	No. If you put thought into it, Federer is not a cry baby. He cried because he was so close to winning his 14th Grand Slam to tie the 14 grand slams of Pete Sampras, the player Roger looks up to. And because the crowd got on their feet and cheered for him. He was over-whelmed by the standing ovation they gave him EVEN though he did not win. So maybe, next time, you should re-think over your words, because they were uncalled for. And to all the people who agree that Roger is a cry baby, put yourself in the man's shoes for goodness sake. Like you wouldn't shed a tear?|`|PTrdGupCaa	Roger is a cry baby YES. Its ok for men to cry also but please let the winner enjoy his victory. You lost Roger so suck it up and tough it out. Roger looked good against birdbrain and del pothead but geez the gap between 1, 2 and the rest is enormous. Roger really thought he would win because Rafa had that titanic battle 48 hours earlier but he still could not beat him. I believe he realised that if he could not win on the night he would be hard pressed to win against him in other circumstances. I have no favourite in these two but please all you Federer lovers wake up, your on the second best player in the world at the moment. Until he swallows his pride, stops being arrogant and hires a coach like every other top tennis player he will continue to slip. Wake up Roger your not superman any more because Rafa is holdong the Kryptonite.|`|rd1zWwphaa	No way, of course you'd be upset if you lost in the final. He was emotional. I think he's amazing|`|uX09rPGlaa	I do not think that Roger was a cry baby. That's just a stupid thing to say. If a women player cried no one would make a big deal about it. He has had a very tough year and he has a right to be upset about losing another major. The mono seems to have really affected him and he is having trouble getting back on track. I think its actually nice to see him get upset it really shows how much tennis must mean to him and how hard he tried.
f1UYyl3Qaa	They hit defensive slices for that reason, defense. When Federer's running across the court and doesnt have enough time to set up for a forehand or backhand he slices. Also, when he slices, since its slower he has time to move back into the court for the next shot.     When its an offensive slice, there trying to hit it so its so low and hard to return, i doubt nadal hit more than 2 winners vs Federer's offensive slice.     They slice cross court too, it all depends on the situation, there pro's, they know there tactics.     As for why not hit a fast backhand winner? Well, its not that simple. They could be in bad position, they could know that it would be low percentage to get a winner from that area, they could be setting up for another shot. Believe me, if they could hit a winner, they will 96 percent of the time.

However, if your backhand is great and your slice sucks, you are going to want to use your regular backhand most of the time.|`|Kw9ZNLknaa	It sets up a more powerful smash or forehand play when it gets returned.  In addition, it brings the opponent off balance because they are probably expecting a fast forehand down the side.|`|IMwvaKkKaa	slice shots mostly throw people off balance, because it is so different from a normal ground stroke. it bounces low and hard to kill back even though it's slow. trust me it's really hard to hit back if u slice a good shot. you even see pros not able to smack it back when the slice is good enough.|`|oPAi65Q2aa	It helps you if you are defensive, you can return to position

rrIgpE2Paa	When your lifting start out at your max and do about 10 reps. Then move down in weight to a good middle point from there...Whatever you lift the most. Keep this up for about 2 weeks and add more weight. Repeat this process in 2 week increments and you should be at 200 before summer. When adding weight try increments of 10lbs. Until you feel better about you abilities. Also don't work the same body parts 2 days in a row. Weight lifting is a process of tearing the muscle and rebuilding it so the body needs a day to heal. If you do upper body one day then do lower body the next alternating between the two. And only strength train for six months out of the year. Doing it for more than that is unhealthy to your body and can hurt in the long run.|`|S2EagBzOaa	geez your short for a lineman, and weak too, no offense, your bench should be close to your weight or at your weight, if you go to a decent school you've got work to do if you wanna see the field your junior year, now here's what you need to do, you should bench press and I mean maxing out every other day, it really helped me out and you should do heavy squats every other day as well, bench and squat are the two most important lifts for football, as well as those two, you should also do side lifts to work your triceps, biceps and other muscles, now what can help you is that you are short so you wont have any problems getting low and driving opponents backwards, good luck and work hard|`|KezaxDNnaa	Eat more cheese burgers.|`|GzaoTspOaa	pls go to a coach  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with   http://watchtvinternet.blogspot.com/

Kendo isn't so much exercise. However you can get in shape by studying just about any art. There are several different "types": fighting, dancing, and a mix.  Kung Fu isn't really a fighting art, they are more of a dancing style. That does not mean, however, that they aren't in amazing shape (because they are).   Tai Chi also isn't a fighting art, it's more about movement and you know all that since you've been doing it.  Jujitsu is a fighting art, a lot of takedowns, joint locks, and often pressure points.  Judo is a somewhat fighting martial art, it's like a sporty version of Jujitsu.  Karate is a fighting art, mostly stand up, some (but not many) takedowns, joint locks, and pressure points.  Tai Kwon Do is like a Korean version of Karate.  This is considering that all of these are traditional schools. Be careful of mcdojos.  I would not suggest studying 3, do only one so that you can have a core, then after having done it for a while you can move on to a different one to "accent" or "reinforce" your core style.  In terms of the best shape, the traditional Kung Fu guys and the traditional Karate (Like Shotokan or Kyokushin) are probably the best overall simply because of how the art works and their culture (but the shape someone is in is not because of the art, it is because of the artist.. however most of these guys are superb artists).  In terms of fighting it's the same, art doesn't make a fighter, the fighter makes himself. But as to which art I've seen that has the best: Probably Jujitsu and Kyokushin.  As to sporty arts, TKD is a good one, Kung Fu can be if you want a less competitive one (remember that their training is tough as heck though).    Riding your bike is a great way to get in shape, also running. Walking as much as you can and just overall moving and not sitting still are key. I personally don't believe much is certain diets, all you need to worry about is burning more calories than you're taking in. Make smart choices, not too much of anything, things that aren't as fatty or sugary, and not any snacks and such. Fruits and veggies, meat is not a bad thing, it's the fat on many meats that isn't so good.  Good luck, hope this helped.|`|MzmDqZ26aa	Stay away from kendo if you want to get into shape. It's not really an exercise-oriented martial art. Otherwise, all of the ones you named are good (though I dunno about Tai Chi, especially if it's the kind that old people do in the mornings).    Thing is, martial arts won't get you into shape as quickly and efficiently as dedicated physical training routines. You trade off learning new skills for rapid fitness improvement.    There are plenty of fitness websites that offer thousands of training schedules and diets. Take your pick.|`|Y95TGph4aa	most likely ull be limited to the martial arts taught near where u live.

rDmlKoRQaa	The play was designed to pull the the safeties outside. Each one was responsible for over the top coverage on the outside route and assumed the other safety would be covering the middle of the field.

Y4mz8BShaa	CAPS LOCK. IT SHOULD BE OFF.    There is no such thing as high quality .12's, and it wouldn't matter if there were. You wouldn't hit a target from 5 metres away firing over 400 with them, and they'd just destroy your hop-up, barrel, and gearbox internals when they break inside it. If you're firing over 400 with .20's, you need to be using .25's.    Never use .12's in an AEG. Never use .12's in a gun firing over 225 FPS with .20's.    There are 6mm metal BB's, although they are very rare, and if you have the power to use them, you have a gas or completely upgraded spring bolt action. Death in AEG's.    You're hearing false rumours.    Firing at 550 without destroying it, you need to be willing to sacrifice $400+. If you want it over 600, be prepared to spend $500 or more, and emptying a high cap will set you back about $5-10 in internal damages.    If you have that kind of money, e-mail me, and I'll make a list. Seeing as you have a JG and are cheap enough to try and use .12's, you don't.    FPS isn't everything. It doesn't mean **** if you can't hit your target.    Airsoft belong in Other - Outdoor Recreation.

Kobe Bryant will be begging Paul Pierce for mercy!!|`|UadP6GO8aa	The real LA fans like Nickster won't make excuses.|`|4V6V9uN8aa	Yeah, probably the same excuses Pierce is thinking of for being put as the  6 reserve on the All Star team.. "Best Player Ever" my dog's a**....!!!!|`|DNkavhfBaa	thursday? what about tonite?|`|N3AiQRJFaa	First of all Peirce is the biggest Faker i know and a traitor at the same side, he grew up in LA and yet he is playing for the Celtics. Secondly most likely the Lakers will lose without Bynum but think about it if Celtics do lose somehow then well i can see your face being red with embarrassment.|`|AA10741561	Yes because the fakers are not that good.
xxtvhn5Naa	Ray Lewis: I think he will get resigned to the Ravens.  I don't think he would work for any other team.    Terell Suggs: He will probably be signed by a team that needs a solid LB, maybe the Buccaneers or the Redskins.    Albert Haynesworth: I can really only see him as a Titan, he wouldn't work for me on any other team.  He gets resigned.    Julius Peppers: He made it clear that he wanted to the on a 3-4 D.  I can see this guy going with a lot of teams.  He would ROCK on the Chargers, but thats a doubful sign, because the Chargers need to save money to resign Rivers/Jackon/Merriman next season.  He would work with the Browns or the Bengals (not sure if they run the 3-4 or not though)    Terell Owens: HE will probably get signed to a 1 or 2 year deal, and then retire.  I don't think he will do to much for the rest of his career.  I can see the Eagles taking him back.    Derick Ward: I REALLY want to see him back with the Giants.  Earth, Wind and Fire wouldn't be the same without Wind.    Brandon Jacobs: Again, I really want to see him on the Giants next year.  He will complete the 1-2-3 punch.    Matt Cassell:  He could go three ways.  1) He is franchised by the Patriots and kept because Brady isn't ready for next season.  2) he is franchised by the Patriots and then traded to the Vikings for a 2nd round draft pick, because Brady is ready for next season.  3) He is released in free agency and signs with the Vikings    Jabar Gaffney:  This guy probably won't get to many offers.  I can see him going with a lot of teams as a slot receiver.  Chargers, Chiefs, Dolphins, and the Vikings are on my list.    Kurt Warner: The Cardinals will loose a lot of fans if they release Kurt Warner after him leading the Cardinals to the Super Bowl.  I think they will resign him for two years, then after those two years, he will retire and Matt Leinard will start.    Kerry Collins: He's old and won't be in the NFL much longer.  he wil probably resign with the Titans.    Darren Sproles:  I read on the internet that he will test out free agency, but wants to go back to the Chargers.  I think the Chargers would be stupid to let this guy go.  If they do let him go, they will have to sign 3 or 4 people to replace him.  A RB, WR, KR, and PR.  And also, they need a guy who can share the carries with LT.  This guy is one of a kind, and the Chargers cannot let him go.    T.J. Houshmandzadeh: With Chad "Ocho Cinco" in his "mental" state, I think Houshmandzadeh will get resigned to the Bengals.    Antonio Bryant: He will probably get signed as a 2nd or 3rd WR.  He makes a fine slot guy.  I can't name any teams right now, but he'll go pretty fast.    Channing Crowder: The Dolphins just recently signed a CFL LB/DE, who is REALLY good.  I think this new guy will be Crowders replacement.  Crowder, could go to multiple teams.  My bet guesses would be the Eagles, Lions, Falcons, or Jets.    Nnamdi Asomugha: One of the better corners in the NFL, will probably go back to the Raiders.  The Raiders don't have any other good corners, besides Asomugha.|`|aRStsO3yaa	Matt Cassel-franchised back to pats  Jabar Gaffney- who cares he drops balls  Kurt Warner-Retired  Kerry Collins-Titans  Darren sproles-either trade LT or keep him,   either way he'll be starter for chargers.  Antoinio Bryant- Tampa bay(Galloway is too old)      All the other ones, nobody really know who   will sign them, there are 31 other teams that  can sign them.|`|qjCl8paPaa	peppers - green bay  sproles -  san diego  owen - cowboys  cassell - patroits  basically most would stay with previous teams|`|MyuexdrYaa	ray lewis- ravens  terell Suggs- Jets  albert Haynesworth- Titans  Julius Peppers-   Terell Owens- Cowboys  Derrick Ward- giants  brandon jacobs- giants  matt cassell- lions  kurt warner- cardinals  kerry collins- tennesse  darren sproles- chargers  tj houshmandzadeh- eagles or bengals|`|NnCnG2QVaa	Kerry Collins  Darren Sproles  T.J.

pANpZ3vaaa	Everyone who challenged other countries by saying they couldn't compete with US in football is just ignorant.    A lot of countries would compete, they dont play because it takes a long time to get where NFL is today (especially a lot of money!!!)    As far as the question goes...They call themselves world champions, because it is only played in the US during the season (yeah, you have NFL Europe, but not during the same season!) doesn't mean you aren't world champions.    Almost every sport is not played by every country in the world, but the champion is still a world champion|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	Because they are world champions. If you can produce another team in the world that could compete with the SB champ you'd have an argument, but you cannot so you don't.|`|GHFlkVaeaa	Yeah I know! They think they are better than the whole world!  its like they call the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA "AMERICA" When America is the whole Continent! Hell Mexicas, Central american Countries are American! we're all in the same continent! Get what I mean!|`|Roes9U61aa	what other countries would they play?|`|gDKIxwRSaa	What country would play them?    Good question though!|`|TtTb78Coaa	because football is the  1 sport in america so its considered big for them|`|43f9Ctozaa	The NBA is the same way. It sounds more empowering.|`|4v0bhxsIaa	Well why don't you tell me who can compete with the US in Football|`|gHtI5xe7aa	sounds better than  national champs, I guess. and no other countries really play football like america, on such a large scale|`|P32Y2ioMaa	That is the arrogance and ignorance of the USA for you. It is only them remember? No one else occupies this planet but the lazy and obese Americans, so naturally whoever and whatever they say are champions we all just have to accept.|`|KKx6zgPuaa	because no one else plays major league football, other than the canadians and americans, and they are the world of football
uxlooKqyaa	oh i totally LOVED it but you had to no about the old one with the coke and mean joe green, my mom had to tell me but even with out it it was still great it was my favorite :D|`|ihaCEikwaa	THE best one--hands down!! LOL!    that was so funnY!|`|qjCl8paPaa	career builder was better|`|iyzQawWFaa	it was funny, but not the besttttt|`|gDKIxwRSaa	I loved it!    It was the best one by far.|`|M5ZZE7W0aa	I thought the same thing.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	It was funny but probably not the best.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	it was not the funniest , it was okay if a bit contrived|`|aRStsO3yaa	Yeah it was pretty funny, but all the other commercials  sucked, but that one was good.|`|2CuuIT70aa	Nah, it was too shmoltzy and predictable.    I liked when they punched a koala bear.  This girl at my party that hadn't shut up since she got there left my place because of it; it was amazing.|`|AA12181104	It was funny but I think the career builder commercial was the best.|`|AedQcjKUaa	I liked it, but I thought the Crystal Ball and the LMAO commercials were better.  The last one reminded me of the one from a few years ago where people had "money coming out the wazzuu (sp?)"
hl9nqKQ2aa	I believe if you are not in a winning position in 85min + and you get a corner, then you will get the option of pressing R3 (pushing the right analog stick in) and the goalkeeper will come out looking for glory!|`|09fhCrEZaa	you can only do that at the end of the game if you are losing
dsnncZ1vaa	Yes they did we should form a mob and go after him|`|M5ZZE7W0aa	The Cardinals won two challenges.|`|scdOQ2CAaa	Refs blew it (suprise)  if you corrected all their false calls its clear cardinals would have won or at least had a legitimate shot at winning    and the previous poster, the cards did win two challenges it just shows that wisenhunt can coach and ref at the same time if he had more challenges he could've corrected all their mistakes|`|nr6KBe8Naa	no they had no chance of winning they are too inexperienced and their defense sucks!|`|6uJeUbRkaa	The Cards D blew their chances.|`|AA11448955	The refs didn't help but it was the bad defense that lost the game for them.|`|ZeKnInbjaa	I think the cardinals blew their own chance.|`|CnPuuKHLaa	they won 2 challenges which gives them a third one. If they thought the calls were bad they should have challenged again.|`|gDKIxwRSaa	Another one of these questions......  Who cares about the "bad calls" ... The Cardinals had PLENTY of chances.|`|zOw22PDyaa	yes defiantly. they was multiple bad calls  their defense sucked?? are you kiddin me they held the steelers to like 3 field goals when they were like 1st and goal|`|ajFpdrb7aa	I think Santonio Holmes blew the cardinals chances. I did see a ton of bad calls though. Thr roughing the passer, the to incomplete passes that were ruled fumbles. Cant wait for next season. GO RAIDERS!|`|laNV7awPaa	THE LAST PLAY HE HAD BOTH FEET IN...ignorant|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Aww! Bitter Cardinal fans ha ha ha ha ha ha|`|MbcvI1A9aa	yeah their was. 100 yards or something in penalties against the cards, but they did give us the call for the safety and didn't let the TD they didn't make slide (roethlisberger run). if james harrison would of got tackled cards we be superbowl champs. 2 bad it had 2 end this way.|`|SEcM9EDZaa	You forgot the return by Harrison as time ran out in the first half. Forget that he didn't actually score, much like Holmes in the Baltimore game--an Arizona player was blocked from behind at about the Cardinal 30 (he went sprawling at Harrison's feet) and the zebra didn't throw a flag. If Harrison isn't given that phantom TD, the Cardinals win.|`|vE531Le6aa	That game was sick, I don't think I can ever watch another NFL game.......EVER!|`|Vbf5Ars5aa	No i watch tapes more than pro's and i have watched this game in slowmo over 5 times today all the refs calls were good but they didmiss a few calls and some were big on the cards and alot of small ones on the steelers|`|VbkKj27jaa	I think there were bad calls both ways but to say that the refs blew the Cards chances is an ignorant statement to make cuz the Cards still had a chance to win in the end. The Cards D blew their chances|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Well their was some bad calls!!But the Cards had a chance to win ,All they needs was Stop the Sleelers on their last drive.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	The Cardinals sloppiness blew the Cardinals chances. I thought for the most part the refs did a very good job with the calls. Gandy was holding all night long. The roughing the holder penalty was a good call. I'm sure Wilson could have not hit the holder as hard if he had put a little effort into it. I thought the roughing the passer call they had when they hit Roethlisberger was bad. He was out of the pocket and I'm sure the defender couldn't see where the ball was. But I don't think it had a big effect on the game. I would have preferred Mike Carey's squad to call the game, but overall it was a nice job.|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	Yes, a bad call is a bad call.  But can it be said of the 90+ some plays run from scrimmage, which one  or two were the deciding calls.  Even in spite of the calls, the Cards took the lead anyway, but could not hold it.  The refs stayed out of it during the last drive.  Now I do agree that the three personal fouls called in the third quarter, seem a little ticky tack for such a big game.|`|o7E9LxV8aa	it was such a good game nobody perfect|`|MaizmvvMaa	Yeah and man am i pissed, them refs ran in stole the ball from warner and threw it to Harrison, and then they mind controlled the defense so they couldn't stop santonio holmes, man what is this world coming to....
dsnncZ1vaa	Doritos   Crystal Ball  And the one where eats a dorito and money comes out of the ATM|`|AA11448955	The box of flowers was easily the best one. lmao|`|utBFEjAzaa	Budwiser|`|laNV7awPaa	the high life one where the guy just yells HIGH LIFE and it cuts to the game lawl|`|uxlooKqyaa	i loved that one but i would have to say that my favorite was the coke and troy polamalu one it was great :D|`|6pIspe7iaa	PEPSIgruber|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I did like the Clydesdale who got the tree branch after the Dalmatian fetched the stick. I liked the one with Alec Baldwin for some TV-computer thing. I don't know what some of the commercials were for. I was glad E*Trade had another baby, actually 2 babies and nobody threw up.     I was glad there was no Justin Timberlake being thrown around or whatever like that soda commercial last year.|`|d4Kcwk7Yaa	the one second high life commercial.  HIGH LIFE!|`|Mlkd5Ig4aa	I liked all of the Budweiser Clydesdale commercials, but I'd have to say the Troy Polamalu Coke commercial was my favorite.  Such a great play on and homage to the classic "Mean" Joe Greene Coke commercial!|`|c6q3EERdaa	I also thought the Doritos crystal ball one was best. Overall, the commercials weren't all that good - and there were a lot of movies being advertised, which surprised me.|`|qjCl8paPaa	career builder|`|o7E9LxV8aa	star trek|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	two caught my attention..    Hey dummy! career builder  LMAO..advertisement for some sitcom..( it wasn't funny but i like the concept)|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	I liked the High Life one, the Doritos crystal ball and the Budweiser Horse fetching a tree.

hF7HyDXEaa	Well mabye when people come around you and sit by you, you can be like oh my gosh i love your hair or your shoes, with lots of enthusiasm!!! or mabye you can just smile alot and put on bright colors that set of energetic friendly vibes.... or mabye you can try to be a bit out there and just like try to laugh alot and talk to girls that are like what you wanna be, and ask them to help you... but it is ok to have the type of personality, you are just a bit matured... i used to be like that,  but then i started to ease up a bit, and start making friends like that and now i am always laughing and smiling and being goofy... but it could just be that you are a little shy to show your feeelings too|`|GCOv4cVraa	When someone's sitting next to you, talk to them. Start conversations with people around you and always be willing to help. Also, you should always be smiling..people will want to talk to you if you're smiling(:
a04gBTjNaa	they have mixed doubles where the men and women play with each other if that answers your question.

If federer was trying he would destroy serena, it wouldn't be interesting at all. Serena would hit her amazing 1st serve, and it would be as good as some second serves in mens. There would be no competition.|`|oPAi65Q2aa	I would like to see Sharapova VS Nadal but it would probably be kinda lopsided.|`|3jBUJxOdaa	No, it would'nt be competetive.|`|IMwvaKkKaa	no competition... i'm sorry it's just so lopsided. the top women's player probably can't compare to the top 100 probably even higher. no sexist. it's just power and endurance level is just not the same.|`|AA10911150	It would be a pointless mismatch. The women would stand no chance. As good as the top women might be in their own sport, they would struggle to win points against guys outside the top 1000 (yes 1000, not 100) in the rankings. It would be a joke.
444cc0a50021891de69824c19550f54daa	it raised my confidence, given me peace of mind made me overall a more stable person  it's changed my life in so many ways and I would never consider stopping it|`|UHTcpdkVaa	I lost a good bit of weight, and I'm now slightly less clumsy in normal life.  Also, I can now touch my toes - hooray!    Honestly, the best that it's done for me is to keep my lazy *** active.  I hate to exercise, but I love working out with the people at my school.  I sit at a desk all day and just can't wait until class starts.  Having a physical outlet makes me happier, my balance has improved drastically, and the training makes me much more aware of what's happening around me.  I don't tire when "working out" with my wife anymore either :-)|`|73wpIlgnaa	Its helped me with everything and I think, because I too am a Christian, that God had be get into the martial arts for that reason.|`|9ZwFQadRaa	The Martial Arts built my confidence, self control, and obedience.

fibXDLy6aa	Well, spikes are not mandatory, or required for any HS team that I know of, but they do help. They can help a lot, espescially at the end of a race when you are really tired and need extra traction for the final sprint. I've heard that 3-8 seconds can be shaven off per each 400m ran with spikes. But basically every XC spike has 4 holes. Each hole has a .25" spike that screws in. The spike can be shorter, or longer, depending on the company that makes the shoe. For Track, you can use XC spikes. They are perfectly normal to use in track, but only for distance events. If you have the extra money to spend, I'd recommend getting a set of spikes for track as well. Track spikes have more holes in the shoes, typically 4-8. And they have less support for your foot. The only bad thing about track spikes are that you can't use them during XC season. You would get many ankle and foot problems due to the lack of support. Oh and by the way, I totally recommend Nike both ways. This is because that is Nike's expertise. That is how they become a company, making spikes for Steve Prefontain, but that's another story.|`|eDCyle05aa	I think spikes help a lot and they don't weigh as much. Brooks and Asics make better running shoes than Nike. Brooks are the most comfortable and have better cushioning, Asics is a close second.|`|J6xmZqj1aa	It would be better to go with a cross country spike for both seasons if you want to save money.  Everything that Running Ginger said is right.  But I don't believe that it makes as huge a difference as I've heard.  My 1500m only improved by a few seconds with spike, and I improved by the same amount every meet last year.  Nike is by far the best shoe company in the world, by nike when ever possible.
mG2BCZe7aa	ROFL.    You compare a Knicks coached by Pat Riley to the Knicks coached by Mike "defense is not in my vocabulary" D'Antoni? LOL. Pat Riley's Knicks woud make this edition of Knick's bleed before scoring a basket.    Check the facts again. ROFL.      Hope this helps.    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -     When Jordan recorded the 55 points in 1995 I don't think Toronto and Vancouver existed in the NBA maps... Then there was the hand check that could limit the touches since the defending players can push you back, And I think Joe Dumar's considered the best Jordan defender even said: "It would have been virtually IMPOSSIBLE to defend Michael Jordan based on the way the games being called right now".    Want a picture of how Dumars defends with the handcheck in tow? Dumars looked like a gaucho corralling the ultimate toro, his feet moving furiously (maybe the best defensive slide in the history of the game), one forearm firmly barred into Jordan to keep contact, the other bent arm thrust into the air, giving Dumars his only hope of keeping his balance while trying to ride the Jordan whirlwind.     Side note: Jordan also recorded that 55 point performance on his 5th game back from a 17 month retirement from NBA basketball.    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    LOL. PS: Everyone knows if you LOOKED at MJ wrong you would get a foul called against you! ROFL.    Did you know that Jordan took only 11 FT's in his 55 point game? Kobe had 20 by that you can assess who got favored....     Rod Thorn even confessed: If the refs perceive that a defender is bumping the cutter, or bumping a ball-handler, then theyll blow their whistles. LOL. Blowing the whistles means more trips to the line. LOL.    Stern suspending the whole team LOL. Another biased assesment? ROFL.    http://youtube.com/watch?v=0z_BBdUETkA    Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, Joe Dumars did their part of trying to intimidate Jordan, and if you may body shots and not called any flagrants... When Bynum hit Gerald, although I believe not intentional NBA called it flagrant 2. LOL. And you're saying Jordan is getting favors? check the facts defense now is so soft a hard hit warrants a flagrant.     http://youtube.com/watch?v=5auPSMaD3vE&f...    ROFL. LMAO. (sorry just can't help it.) LOL. ROFL.|`|zRoDeilLaa	NO, he's still 26 points short      81 > 55      Kobe > Jordan        Hope this helps ........LMFAO!    _______________    To my idiot IMPOSTER (below) ..... you mean like Jordan won a ring without Pippen?      BOW DOWN YOU CLOWN!    JDWJ76 (me)  IS THE REAL KING!!!!!  _________    Thomas W ..... you're a MORON ......the Celtics let Jordan score 63 points because they knew one player wasn't gonna beat a whole team.

Put down your Space Jam doll idiot!|`|R3RkyRztaa	In the 90's teams actually played defense. And you are telling me the Knicks of today are better than the 1994-95 Knicks DEFENSIVELY? I honestly don't think so.|`|xm2ZxPXXaa	new york knicks of the 90's better then the team they have now,  90's>the watered down 00's  why,  lots of flopping in the league  40+ high school drafted into the nba since after 1998 and where are they now,  touch fouls,  defensive 3 second rule in effect and hand checking made the game soft,  now read all of this,  http://hoopshype.com/articles/defense_la...  if you think kobes great, not even close, now you know why kobe has the edge over jordan with the 3 point shots,  kobe works through touch fouls to become who he is now, jordan went through the physical game to become the greatest player ever to play the game!|`|yj1xTfZwaa	imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. kobe wishes he was mike. mike played for the love of the game. kobe plays for the love of kobe. when mj dropped 63 against the celtics, dj, bird, mchale, parrish, ainge, etc. tried to d him up non of um could stop him. all of them played great defense, dj was considered one of the best defensive stoppers in the nba. the bulls needed every point in a losing cause. kobe will never drop over 60 against a great team. bottom line kobe could'nt hold mj's sneakers. ask david stern who's better. my brother says that he has'nt even watched an nba game since mj retired. ask the nba and there revenue dept.|`|0vXjN20kaa	Ha ha ha!!! I love this question. You funny. But its gonna be true, when its all said and done, people will be saying Kobe-esque! (The unfortunate fact is that one day Kobe, MJ, James and many more future stars will drop down in the "Best player ever rankings. Its inevitable. But right now, 2009, the new millennium, it all belongs to Kobe!     Remember 81, remember 61 @ MDG! Remember 62 vs Maves in 3 quarters when the Maves whole team had 61.(What if Kobe played another 12 minutes???)     REMEMBER KOBE BRYANT...  8/ 24!!!!!!    THE REAL "BEST PLAYER EVER"!!!|`|XrCc85kNaa	yeah....|`|KhBmlaefaa	Nope. MJ played a better quality Knicks team. Kobe had a great night though. Kobe was Jordanesque.

bB5d5YVeaa	I understand how you feel.  After I got my black belt, I just wanted to take a break from it.    Just explain to him that after all these years and all those many evenings of practicing and testing for your belts, that you feel you need a break from it.  But, be prepared to offer-up plan B on the next thing you would like to undertake in life.  Parents just want to make sure that their kids are working toward goals in their life.    So, you will need to come-up with something else to devote your time to.  I never did it, but one of my goals in life used to be (and possibly still is) to get my private pilot's license and be able to fly an airplane.|`|pTXFnQ1Saa	Tell him you're not having fun with it, and it's not making you happy. If he wants you to learn for self defense tactic, ask him if maybe you can do kick boxing or something more fun?    You shouldn't do something you don't like because your parent wants you to (sports wise)      jenna-justcallmeh21|`|d3zT4NFaaa	You must be soft.|`|lMDy8W0Raa	It's your dad but it's also your life. If he gets mad it's his problem. You are not letting him down. You are letting yourself down by doing something you don't like.|`|MnECjJ00aa	just say its shitty and you dont want to do it anymore and tell him he shouldnt try to live out his dreams thru you, besides you can always lift weights and buy a gun.|`|b0faTDlJaa	being dedicated and finishing through with things in life is very important, but if you really do not want to do karate any more, try to find out why it is so important to your dad, I think that in his reason is also a way out of karate.|`|4gwSrPhfaa	just refuse to train, show up at the dojo sit down and dont move until ur parents come to pick u up that simple, when ur dad gets fed up with spend $ so u can just sit there and do nothing he will let u quit,|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	If you were a real black belt, under a real sensei at a real school you would not want to quit. Evidently you are not. Sorry but I would switch schools.|`|FALAA4Lqaa	My brother was a black belt in Tae Kwon Do, and eventually started teaching it. He loved it, but had to give it up because he started his job in NY.    I honestly think you should stick with Karate, because it's soemthing that sets you apart from everyone else and makes you different, in a good way.|`|nBvbCK9Aaa	Tell him you're not having fun with it, and it's not making you happy. If he wants you to learn for self defense tactic, ask him if maybe you can do kick boxing or something more fun?    You shouldn't do something you don't like because your parent wants you to (sports wise)    He MAY think it's good for you, but tell him that you're not passionate for it.    I hope it works out the way you want!|`|8e9a28782c8446395b12f275754b4b76aa	If you're at a point in your life where your activities are still being controlled by your parents, you're not a black belt. If your father is angry with you because you're doing badly in karate class, you're not a black belt. If you need to come here for advice on how to interact with your parents, you're not a black belt. The easiest way to convince your father to let you stop taking classes is to point out to him that your school is obviously a McDojo, and is stealing his money.
FmZyN6ORaa	oh wow...you chose the wrong time to fall asleep lol   the cardinals made the biggest comeback in SB history with 2 TD's in the 4th quarter and came back to take the lead 23-20...Warner threw a TD pass to Fitzgerald with two minutes remaining which put the Cardinals in the lead. the steelers took over, and the cardinal's D couldn't stop them from advancing down the field...Ben threw a TD pass to Santonio Holmes (MVP) who made a great catch...so the Steelers took the lead 27-23. The Cardinals took over with 35 seconds left in the game. on 2nd down (i think), Kurt tried to throw the ball but it got knocked out of his hands...this was the most controversial play of the game. It was ruled a fumble and Steelers recovered the ball with 25 seconds left, although many people think that it should have been ruled an incomplete pass since Warner's arm was moving forward with control of the ball when it got knocked out...I pretty sure they didn't review the play. Steelers ended up winning the game 27-23.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	o man u missed one of the greatest catches in superbowl history|`|ufr8TU6Jaa	It was pretty crazy, with some turn overs, and some bad calls, but the Steelers won... thats all ya need to worry about ;-)     It was GREEAAATT!!|`|oPAi65Q2aa	Cardinals caught up but then blew it with 36 seconds to go after Santonio caught a TD in the corner of the endzone|`|RS3fjNboaa	Oh that sucks!

gMTatFZBaa	Yes, we're all very familiar with the QHHS try outs, we talk about it often on here.     The try outs start on Friday at 3:pm. Do not be late. That is the first  and only day.     Hope this helps.|`|d8e728311057920726dbfbc7353ca59faa	ahaha slapppy larue... not the perfect place to ask... its called a fone, text or email... WOW or even go to a friends house dude. serious?
fm5QR6hYaa	When I was in wrestling we did a lot of neck stretches. First, do some warm-up exercises to loosen your body out. I find that warming up before stretching makes my body more flexible, and able to stretch further. When stretching the neck, progress little by little like you do with all stretches. If while lying down you want to touch your nose on the ground by bending backwards, start by only stretching back until your neck feels resistance. Stop. Hold it there for 16 seconds. Then, release. Do that everyday, going a little further each time. If it feels uncomfortable, or really painful, stop immediately.|`|Gi4J3KKEaa	copying the neck workout tyson did is really not suggested for beginners and its mostly a show off exercise since there are other alternatives that strengthen your neck better and safer.    if you want to train your neck,  rotate your neck several times and stetch it by moving it from one side to the other and holding in place for several seconds. (think north- look up, south: chin to chest, east,: neck to shoulder: west: neck to shoulder)     lie down on your back with your entire body on a flat bench with only your neck and head sticking out.     now bring your head up and down touching the top of your chest with your chin.  continue bringing your head up and down in rep fashion until failure.  do a few sets of these.    you can also do dumbbell shrugs: attempt to touch your ears with your shoulders; and upright rows: standing upright,use a barbell and bring it up to the top of your chin and back down.     a weighted neck harness strapped around your head is also very good and works out your entire neck.  go ahead and purchase one. start with light weights and as you get comfortable, increase the weight.      it is best if you work out your neck before your other muscle groups or superset preferably with shoulders. good luck.|`|u9ToxnfSaa	take some classes to get more flexible

n2O0NwR6aa	I'd go with the second pass.  They'll both be worth the same points, but I just think the stepout looks better at the end of pass, especially if you make it nice and high.    Can you do a front handspring step out (aka front walkover)?  A combination pass of front and back tumbling would be best of all.  How about:    Front handspring stepout, roundoff, back handspring, back handspring stepout    Or:      Roundoff, back handspring stepout with 1/2 turn, round off, back handspring, back handspring stepout    Judges go crazy for combo passes like that.|`|X7IsNqI7aa	I think number 2 is better.

WGP5E9X5aa	i shoot a hoyt power hawk..... with 4 pins..use:    20 yards  30 yards  40 yards   50 yards    anything under 20 will shoot dead on...just use your 20 pin...if anything aim a touch low but use your 20 pin|`|svbFM4Zyaa	Depends on a couple of things. 1. your skill level 2. your hunting area(is it thick with brush timber and so forth or just a hard woods open area?) These are the two biggest things to figure out first. I shoot in a pretty open are but it only offers a safe 35 yard shot max. I use pins setup at 10, 20,30 and 40 yards. I would not take a shot past this without a lot of practice and I am a pretty good shot. I split an arrow last year at 30 yards and that was after I told my wife I would do it. She didn't believe me until I did it. I would also tell you to make sure you are shooting carbons if your going past 35 yards because they will fly a lot faster and straiter then alums. will.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	You should sight any ranged weapon at the mean (average) distance you plan to use it.|`|nooi0ldjaa	4 sight pins, if it was my bow i'd sight it in like this     1  15 yards   2  30 yards   3  50 yards   4  55 or 60 yards.    you never know when that deer well show up almost under your feet, or just a few yards to far. so better to play it safe then sorry.|`|j1s8SNgaaa	With four pins, it's probably best to break them apart at 10, 20, 30, and 40 yards, the 10 yard pin being on the top.  That's if you'll be hunting deer and are not very confident with your shooting ability yet. This will give you a basic range for most distances you'll be hunting at.  Once you've become a better shot, move your pins up to 20, 30, 40, and 50 yards just so you can hit at those further ranges.
AA10939368	Dan Marino without a second thought.  Trent Dilfer only won a superbowl because of his amazing defense.  Marino is the best pure passer to ever play the game.  He was able to get the Dolphins into the playoffs many times, unfortunately it takes the whole team to win.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	haha then the rest of his team better be good lmao|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Your friend is a moron. I'd only take Dilfer if I had the Ravens 2000 defense. If the 2000 Ravens had had Marino instead of Dilfer they'd have gone undefeated.|`|ABoo1doVaa	Your friend is a moron. It's a team game, and you are talking about an individual player. I would rather have the Ravens team, but Marino as a player. If Marino played for the Ravens, they would have gone undefeated.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	Your Friend better stay home from work one day and watch ESPN all day, just so he can see what real players there are in the league.|`|ySjHowZqaa	Marino.

VJ1Gsr0Xaa	not much defense going on in that game anyways. but this just means kobe will do what he has to do to win ballgames. he is going to need and MVP type second half to try to get the best record and have home court advantage in the playoffs. miss andrew big time though. especially these big games coming up against boston and cleveland.       LAKERS  1|`|MPz9APZDaa	I really don't think this means anything, he was on fire from the start so why not keep giving him the ball. Plus the Knicks were playing Kobe 1 on 1. Kobe just read the defense and made the plays.|`|sCHUFUXsaa	the knicks' defense sucks thats why.  he can go over wilson chandler anytime.  but i think it's a good sign, if he scores like this every game  there's some chance lakers will win (if his fg is .500 or more)    BQ: i think so. i think jermaine oneal is okay but his salary is so big!   21 million, wow! so maybe a good center like what they did to pau.|`|gDkAsUGKaa	doesnt mean really anything lol.  hes just kobe. probly felt like showing it cuz he has lot to make for makin bynum injured!!!|`|mG2BCZe7aa	Bad sign I saw a lot of "0' in the player's box score... He also had only 3 assists. It means the ball stopped flowing once he touched the ball.      Hope this helps.|`|L9A81Xvvaa	*stratching my head*     "Is that a trick question?"|`|XrCc85kNaa	No...

And Kobe shot only 30 shots....granted he took 20 FTs|`|3jBUJxOdaa	no, he's gonna do what it's gonna take to win..    without bynum in the line-up, kobe will have to shoulder more especially on the offensive end..but he have enough confidence on his teammates now so, so he's not gonna be pushing so hard to score just to win..    this game is just a once-in-a-while show, and i love it.|`|p4H61jQDaa	nah means nothing cause he just wanted to put on a show for new york|`|ba7cca95147ca64ee9b79a5ddb025566aa	he was on a shooting streak.  it means nothing.  when ANY PLAYER is on fire and on a shooting streak, dont you think theyll take advantage of that?    needless to say, his performance was amazing.    the old kobe's still there and his ability to shoot is still there.  today was proof of that to anyone who thought otherwise [who WOULD think otherwise anyways tho?]|`|YwpKrQOsaa	I don't think he was ball hogging,  I think it was just a fast paced game (due to D'Antoni's offensive system) and Kobe got hot which can result in a pretty high scoring night.    He only attempted 31 shots (and made 19) so he wasn't forcing his game, he didn't chuck up a bunch of 3s, and he went to the FT line often.    Also Pau Gasol had 31 himself.    If you look at the last few seasons Kobe always seems to have the highest scoring game every year.    (05-06)-81  (06-07)-65  (07-08)-53  (08-09)-61|`|whE5OQ26aa	The NBA is WWE, I hardly pay attention anymore.

Nate had a bad slump there but he's getting back into his groove as of lately! Yeah we have Roberson but he never is used. I would try to send Malik Rose their way or better yet...  Eddy Curry.    I hear ya thought! D Lee is outsized every night! Think if he went back to PF and we had a decent center? We would be over .500!    Knicks!|`|XrCc85kNaa	lol...that will never happen...

And to make matters worse, that title reign was for one f'n night cuz he lost it back to his brother the following night. I liked him having the ECW title but it wasn't as impressive considering it's pretty much a lifeless title in the WWE.    I'd bring back the cruiserweight title, or light heavyweight, whichever one u wanna call it. The cruiserweights would have to either win a world title which Vince would never let happen or the IC or US title which Vince keeps in the hands of possible future title contenders.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Rey Mysterio.

But with the great players he's got around him you wouldn't really think he needs to drop 61.|`|sCHUFUXsaa	you just knew that?    he scored 81 one time..    one time he also did this streak where he scores  50+ pts in each game in a row|`|tnqO91xoaa	anything could happen when kobe has the ball in his hands|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Kobe = fire you mess with him you will get burnt!!

CoHl61Hjaa	Finicky - I know ....      But humans don't have a 'tail bone' - we lost  that with Evolution !!    The part you refer to is known as the 'Coccyx'  (pronounced Kok-siks) -     Nevertheless - YES it hurts when landed on !  Though I've never hurt my Coccyx whilst on a  bike - there have been occasions where I've  slipped on ice or a banana skin - landing right  on my butt !!    I don't know what's worse (lol) - the pain of the  fall or the pain of the embarrassment !!|`|WVbMdohwaa	Yes! You can absolutely break it. Landing on it wrong can bruise or bend it, which can be extremely painful. Bruising is more likely and there is really no cure. You just have to sit around and let it heal.|`|qM4cMNufaa	u can if u fall hard anof|`|b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	One of the junior girls out our local track broke hers while racing, but it was due to a jump that went wrong and the way she landed when she came off.|`|h0Y2m65baa	Yes you can,when i had my first race on a vintage can am 125 and i hit a huge rut and it caused me to slide off the back and i hit my tailbone on the rear fender mount.Back in those days the rear fender mount was part of the frame that looped over top of the rear fender with a bolt sticking out.nothin but tailbone,and yes it really hurts,all i could do is put a ice pack on my but in between motos to try to help with the pain|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	I'm not sure that there is anything you can't break riding motocross.

pSOrIUYsaa	http://www.steelertribute.com/  Look at this picture, that's all I have to say about Sanantonio Holmes' touchdown.  Not only that, he used the ball as a prop. That plus the 15 yard penalty AT THE MINIMUM. Cardinals  would have gotten the ball AT about the 50 yard line, that and with two time outs with 30 ticks left. WE HAVE A BALL GAME!  Now the issue of the last play not being reviewed (I personally think Kurt Warner's arm was moving forward), and the booth should have called it I MEAN COME ON the circumstances were so HUGE! If it was over-ruled it would be at the 29 yard line with the penalty with 15 ticks left so it no longer becomes a hail marry, they proved they could move the ball by the 2 previous plays. Larry Fitzgerald was red hot, there could have easily been another touchdown. OR if they ruling stays the same; Steelers win.      In ending, the game wasn't rigged, it was over officiating the wrong parts of the game and under officiating at the WRONG parts of the game..but I wouldn't be surprised if it was..|`|dv0bLUFZaa	it was a fixed game my friend.........sumone payed those ***** *** referees to not call anything against Stealers. CARDINALS SHOULD HAVE WON!!!   SCREW THE SHITLERS!!!!|`|oPAi65Q2aa	Refs missed it|`|G33fM9GVaa	You know why they didn't call a penalty on any of the other touchdowns.  Because I know for sure on the Ftiz TD's he immediately ran back to the bench, no celebration there.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Because the Steelers were meant to win.|`|KTp27Fokaa	Because he was impersonating LeBron, which never gets called for a travel. If Lebron doesn't get penalties, why should people that impersonate him get penalties?|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Because the whole thing was rigged. Didn't you see the black helicopters circling the stadium?    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Nobody saw it during the game. Maybe he did it on the sideline after the play was over and it wasn't an end zone celebration.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	Cause the refs would do the same thing if they were in his position, if you just got the game winning TD in the biggest game of your life. I would get naked if i had that happend to me, many of the players dream about that moment there entire life and he just decided to play it off like LBJ. Dont Blame Holmes or the refs.|`|AA10939368	This question was asked at least 100 times today, personally I am sick of it.  It would not change the outcome so why ask it?    From what they said today on ESPN, the ball is not considered a prop.  The most they could have done was penalize for overcelebration and they would not do that in the superbowl.  It is the biggest game of the year.  Not only that, they did not make the call the entire game, they are not going to do it on the game winning touchdown.    Lastly, the last play was a fumble.  It was reviewed in the booth as there were less than two minutes left on the clock.  In order for it to be called an incomplete pass his arm would have needed to be in forward motion with the ball.  The ball was stripped already.  That is called a fumble.|`|OeFNGqbzaa	because none of the refs saw it|`|tJa60S4Taa	He's just nodding at LBJ's chalkman routine, I don't think it was meant to be mean to the Cards..|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	idn man they had bad calls tht came|`|ABoo1doVaa	It's a makeup call for the Fiesta bowl when he dove into the endzone between two defenders, and was flagged for a penalty against ND.|`|jisJ1Bj3aa	Imagine if they called that as a 15 yarder like it should have been. The cards would have had the ball starting at probably the 40-50 with 30 seconds and 2 timeouts.    BS superbowl|`|7gFpQB4faa	The failure of that no-call is as mysterious as the lack of an official replay of the Warner (supposed) fumble that sealed it for the Steelers.    The biggest game of the season - and they let it end like THAT??    Chances are, the call would not have been reversed, but it should have been reviewed.|`|utJYCCvaaa	yea even tho rules are rules and they should be followed it was after the TD was in Review if you watch he got the ball landed on his but looked at the ref call it TD and he got dog piled by his teammates they put it into reveiw then he did it on the sidelines... com on that wasn't a McNabb...

UWctMa0Taa	First do this workout to get some meat on your legs. If you work out for I don't know, maybe 2-4 weeks, you'll be fine. All you need to do is pack em' up with some muscle so that you'll have more potential to throw your weight around (You will get better results if you lift first.)    After you do this, do the vertical program Air Alert 3 (I can give it to you, E-Mail me.)    If you want, doing a speed training course will help your vertical tremedously... It did for me. I'll send you that, too. Once again, you'll need to E-Mail me.    Enjoy the workout, and Good Luck.

3teWTOPqaa	sports fan is someone that enjoys sports, bandwagone is a kind of sports fan that only follows winning teams and are capable of switching teams even at the last second.    Sports fan: Lakers fans, Blazers fans, Cavs fans, etc.    Bandwagoners: Celtics fans, Celtics fans, and Celtics fans, etc.|`|98wFqBwSaa	People from Chicago are sports fans, where as people from LA are bandwagon fans     It's the difference between knowledge and knowledge of what the media tells you.|`|xGRh8k2Baa	A real "fan" is somebody that will follow a team thru thick and thin.  Somebody that will wear a jersey or just let people know where their allegiances lie, no matter how bad the team is doing that year.  A bandwagon jumper is just somebody that starts cheering for a team that is doing good or even has a good story.  The Tampa Bay Rays are probably a very good example, altho that's MLB and it's not so much the team, but the people that only start cheering for them because they are good.  There is nothing wrong with jumping on the bandwagon of a good story, but some big sports people get upset with the people that just suddenly start cheering for a team after they win.  The best example in the NBA would be the Celtics, and again, it's not the team, it's more the people that came out of the woodwork as "fans" after they won.  Maybe even the Lakers now that they are one of the dominant teams in the league again.|`|zY7jDpE6aa	Sports fans like sports in general and they generally have a favorite team so they might like the Blazers. They would know the players on the team and stuff about the team because it is their favorite team even tho they arent that good. Now if one of the Blazers fans started liking the spurs back when they one the championship the last time for no reason other than that they would then be on the bandwagon of people who suddenly liked the spurs cuz theyre winning|`|37PYnKr9aa	Sports Fans love their team no matter how bad they do. I am a diehard Piston fan. I wish we never traded for Iverson. Billups had become my favorite Piston. Anyways, its when you stay up late to watch the game and your heart drops when it is so close. You have a hatred for Robert Horry hitting that 3 pointer in overtime in Game 5 of the Finals 4 years ago. You still cry about that game. Thats the real true fans.    Fakes are the ones who you saw 5 years ago as Laker fans and then you see them now support the Celtics!|`|hR87A418aa	sports fan is someone that enjoys sports, bandwagone is a kind of sports fan that only follows winning teams and are capable of switching teams even at the last second.

iPWKzzQtaa	Unbelievable money for a pitcher who has never pitched 200 innings, but as a caveat....Sheets is very questionable, you must notice the lack of serious offers on him. So who else was available?    I look at it like this. The Mets could go all the way this year, the way the bullpen is shored up...they have hitting and defense. If they went to the Series and Perez contributed 14-15 wins, we would say good move. But if Sheets was signed and went on the DL..things could get much worse.        If I was GM...I would have skipped on Perez and looked for a mid season pick up....with no contract on the line.    To Markleno and the Mets fans...you guys come here everyday wanting to add players to the Mets roster....it's a 25 man roster...please consider that.|`|GwawzO5Faa	Christmas comes early for Perez. Not sure what the Mets were thinking.|`|oPAi65Q2aa	I love my Mets but they blew it, should've gone for Sheets and Perez instead of just perez|`|28c0495788bedefa03a0bf8e36f5ed48aa	I was surprised with the way things were going on the free agent front. Maybe the Mets were desperate and they didn't want to gamble on Sheets.  You can't judge a pitcher on wins. As a previous post already stated, the bullpen was terrible. The walks are more of an indicator to be concerned about.  I think, for the money, AJ Burnett was worse.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	I agree with everything what you said. Good job!  No explanation necessary!|`|fafd4d858e4fee9b87096037aab92978aa	Mets fans are too demanding too quick.  Now they have to re-sign Pedro and overpay for manny.  If they would spend half as much as they spent for Perez on player development they would have good players in their farm system and would not have to be the wannabe-Yankees and buy up    dried-up, old, past-their-prime, players. Their GM would save a lot of cash if he spent 8 bucks on the bargain shelf at Barnes & Noble and bought the book Moneyball.|`|xKDhlgadaa	Time will tell, but I think he may become one of the best in the game. Awesome stuff, remember he is only 27, if he can get the walks down the innings will go up and so will the wins. By the time he's 30, could be Cy Young material. So, my opinion, great signing.
iO12Vjnvaa	Well if you are serious enough about it, ask your parents to move to North Carolina we have a short track/dirt track in just about every county. Get started running karts or LMS not alot of money required...but racing is not a free ride. 16 is a little old to get started in my opinion....but it's still do-able.

xxq5JAM6aa	Check out www.crazyguyonabike.com. Great site for cycling touring.    Basically tho, you need panniers(bags) to haul everything. Tent, sleeping bag, sleeping mat, clothes, food, rain gear, etc. Your bike needs at least a rear rack for the bags.     If you're young and tough, you really don't need much for a 200 mile trip. Can be done in two days. If weather is good, just a sleeping bag and piece of tarp to put it on. Maybe another small tarp to rig as dew cover. Wild camp and eat at restaurants.    Or, just do a credit card tour. Motels and restaurants. Nothing but you on the bike.

QlrIUIfOaa	What grade are you in?  How strong is your team?      Assuming you are 9th grade, and can do the following, talk to the coach:    -sign up for group lessons at your local club  -sign up for individual lessons at your local club  -sign up for at least two camps (spring break and summer) - Vandy may well offer a camp, if not, the internet will offer options.  If not, look at Newk's in Texas  -play as many tournaments as you can     If you go to your coach with that plan, and have put it in place, he/she may be interested.    But, the best strategy may be to skip gym class for the rest of the year and take off-campus athletics.  Go to the tennis center for group/individual lessons every day.

Go Habs Go    And I agree with the first poster, the Globe trotters put on the best sports-related show you can come across. They are truly amazing. My father played against them when he was in university and said it was one of the best experiences of his life.    Also, you know the habs are gonna win so hook me up with them tickets and go see the GTs. Seriously, all jokes aside, the MTL vs BUF is probably going to be pretty good but even though I am a diehard hockey fan, you gotta go see the GTs. Go to another sabres game this year.    Have a nice day.|`|ee134a449c589ff668544b200a2bebadaa	hockey is the better sport, but the globetrotters put on one of the best shows you'll ever see. go see harlem.|`|M6P7r57faa	Halrme Globetrotters since theres black people

K5AeQuSNaa	Pawn shops have to put all guns that come in on a 30 day pawn shop hold (that is what it is called) while the numbers are given to the DOJ to run a check on them.  I know because I occasionally get guns from them, and I always check to see what they have on hold.  It usually gives me a chance to put deposits on things I want before they get put up on the shelves.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Well, considering that pawn shops are required to regularly (daily? weekly?) submit their received property logs to the local police, I'd not worry about it much.     Mmm, if there's no serial number, or if they refuse to give you any paperwork (title transfer, for example), or do not/refuse to do a background check, bail out.     Actually, if it wasn't snowing like crazy, I might consider scouring the pawn shops in the area for pawn arms. Good idea!|`|MeeJWmGtaa	There is a list of stolen firearms that is available to law-enforcement via the N.C.I.C. database. Any agency with LEADS/NCIC access can run a check.|`|vea6mqPZaa	Take the serial number, make model and receipt to the local PD ask the desk sergeant to run it to make sure it is not stolen.    If it is stolen then offer to have him/her follow you to your house to retrieve it and offer your assistance in the investigation. (this part keeps you from a "receiving stolen goods" charge.
e6194ade1f407494b6f0be00450abb7caa	I am a swimmer. I have worked hard and i have a six pack, and a pretty toned body. The thing is swimmers are pretty skinny. Swimmers dont usually bulk up like weight lifters, but you do get stronger, leaner muscles. Since you are skinny, you will probably see results quicker than most people will. If you do crunches and keep on swimming, you could potentially see yourself with a six pack in a month or two. That happened to me. I think if you are consistent and you work hard enough, i think you will see results within 2-3 months.|`|Y5v6bGJMaa	You won't see the buffness that comes from lifting weights and stuff but after a couple weeks you'll probably see your body get more tone. You're muscles will be more clearly defined and you'll have much greater endurance.|`|yS5f1XLFaa	it depends on how hard u work. if u dont work hard, ull still get some muscle cuz u r moving urself through the water, but it wont b as big or as clearly defined as the muscles u get when u work ur *** off. im a swimmer (girl, 13 yrs old) and i swim competitively so my muscles and my friends muscles r probably bigger than the whole rest of da skool.
OfNTLq3Qaa	ECW is only an hour show. They barely have enough TV time for the young stars they have now. Adding a womens title would be pointless as we'd never get to see it defended. The WWE cannot add to the roster of ECW when they only have an hour show.|`|dcNT65mTaa	I think they should put the cruiserweight title on ECW if anything. I don't think the WWE needs another Diva title. Its already too much separation of the superstars.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Yes, I agree but they need more divas. They should start by sending Michelle McCool over there.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	They would need ALOT more divas on the roster for ECW to have a womens belt, so no|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	ECW doesn't have a big enough diva roster to start one for one and for two: The two championships they have already aren't exactly very good anymore anyway.|`|AA10576394	Honestly, I think the Diva matches are a waste of time.  They're really not that interesting to watch, and I don't hear many people talking about what Beth Phoenix did to Kelly Kelly ie.  I'm sure the fellas like a little eye candy during the show, but for me personally, I think we could do with less Diva matches and not add any more.|`|Bp3bt5bCaa	no. diva wrestling sucks|`|8BICk4r5aa	Well the 2 women championships aren't very interesting to start with, so why bring in a new one?|`|TWQNYhVVaa	They'd have to have alot more Divas..and then I still don't think it'd be a very good Idea..

YiFwUJZkaa	If you live in Australia then every English premier league game of every round is shown live on the fox sports channels. Setanta is a good suggestion but it is quite expensive and you pay per month, I also think that the sports and matches they show on Setanta change from country to country.     The majority of teams in the EPL have a TV service through their website that ony requires a small fee per year or sometimes they have extended highlights available to watch for free. I support Liverpool and on their website they have a dedicated TV zone where they broadcast every LFC game for paying members. If you are going to sign up be careful because some areas and video content of the LFC website are for UK residents only, im not sure about other teams.|`|09SjyOHkaa	i guess go onto the fox website and look for customer support    but it might be on setanta instead of fox so fox wouldnt broadcast it...or it's too early in the US for it to show because fsc has infommercials till 7 or 8 in the morning

mpOGnr6vaa	The .577 Nitro Express has been around a long time, and its bullet is .585" and closest to true 15 mm. or .591". There's also a newer .577 Tyrannosaur that's more powerful than the old .577 Nitro. Putting phosphorus in bullets isn't practical. It's better in a grenade that's much bigger and of much lower velocity. Fulminate of mercury in a bullet won't detonate. It just ruins a hollowpoint. Neither phosphorus nor mercury fulminate are powerful enough explosives to cause much damage if used in a 15 mm. bullet. As several people said, even if such bullets did explode, they'd only cause superficial wounds and make an elephant feel justified in stomping you into the ground or pulling you apart. What's needed is a bullet with a steel core that penetrates an elephant's thick and tough muscles and bone to reach vital organs. It needs a copper jacket to grasp the rifling and not wear it out. African hunters have been using such bullets for a long time, and they work well. The ones you mention will only get you killed by angry elephants or rhinos.|`|5mxy4WaMaa	.59 caliber.  To convert mm to cal divide by 25.4, to convert from cal. to mm multiply by 25.4|`|h2KkiKK3aa	that would be .58 caliber, not often used now, exactly 15 millimetres would be .59 caliber, but have not heard of anything closer to this then .58.  some muzzleloaders are still made for it, but only 2-3 company's do it, the Kentucky/Pennsylvania rifle was .58 caliber, as many other civil war rifles were.  Edit*   some bullets were made bigger then normal by accident and sometimes on purpose so they were tighter in the barrel, making more pressure and adding to the speed and power of the rifle.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	That's about 59 caliber, larger than current dangerous game rifles but about the size of a 20 guage shotgun. Note that four bores were once used for elephants but quickly went away with the advent of smokeless propellants. Also, about a century ago, when English gentlemen were supposed to spend a few months on safari, people tried filling fulminate of mercury and other such things into bullets, with a complete lack of success.  When you're trying to stop an elephant charge, a hollow bullet with an incendiary or explosive in it is exactly what you DON'T want. A reasonable level of power is, of course, needed, but what really counts is getting a bullet to penetrate deeply into the vital area. In an elephant, that normally means a long trip through a lot of cancellous bone, where it's easy for force to be absorbed and any deformation of the bullet will deflect it off track. What's needed is a bullet of solid construction that won't bend or rivet.|`|TvARYVRJaa	and the charging beast fell,, form  the earth by a single shot from  mr. wilibeys , custom revlover  cold as blue ice he was,,as the pistol recoil and the beast seemed to drop ,,mr pendergast replied,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|`|16gnzVayaa	I just wanted to say that 15mm was an old, anti-aircraft cannon caliber. It was replaced by the 20mm cannons because 15mm's performance wasn't that great on aircrafts. 15mm connon is more powerful than 50 BMG.|`|tuULGJS6aa	15 mm = 0.591". There's a .600 Nito Express, but it may be obselete now. The .600 NE took down many elephants. Steel jacketed bullets are advised, because an elephant has thick skin and bones that lead bullets can hardly penetrate. The trick bullet you mention will only cause a nasty surface wound and anger an elephant or rhino. A regular softpoint is fine for a grizzly, and you don't need a .600 for it. A .338 does a great job on them. Exploding bullets are too small to do much damage with fulminate of mercury. I've tested some in a .45 ACP pistol, and regular hollowpoints caused much more damage to trees, catalogs and telephone books.
