20090223163807AAFb4jS	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Could any one please suggest a phrase?	Hi, I am an Afghan journalist in london and beside my job, i ran this website: www.afmonitor.com. Sometimes (or better to say mostly) a 'news' is only an official verion of an event and many surrounding facts are overlooked due to many reasons. I am thinking about writing informal versions of a news where I could give more information using a more relaxed language (an excuse for my bad English?) and I am looking for an interesting title for this particular column on my website. I need a title which indicates the importance of the information, while deos not imply judgement. I thought of words like "Deformalized" or "De-officialized" (ok! i know it is not a word but this wrong word suits the type of contents I intend to write). Could anyone come up with a correct English word or idom which could convey the meaning you feel from "De-officialized"?   Now, apart from this, I would like to invite those interested to contribute to the website. I also very much appreciate if anyone is ready to proof read/edit our materials. Please email me at ahakimi[at]afmonitor.com.   thank.

20070427011757AA41ab3	News & Events;Current Events	Who said it?	"I think that the proposition of going to Baghdad is also fallacious. I think if we we're going to remove Saddam Hussein we would have had to go all the way to Baghdad, we would have to commit a lot of force because I do not believe he would wait in the Presidential Palace for us to arrive. I think we'd have had to hunt him down. And once we'd done that and we'd gotten rid of Saddam Hussein and his government, then we'd have had to put another government in its place. What kind of government? Should it be a Sunni government or Shi'i government or a Kurdish government or Ba'athist regime? Or maybe we want to bring in some of the Islamic fundamentalists? How long would we have had to stay in Baghdad to keep that government in place? What would happen to the government once U.S. forces withdrew? How many casualties should the United States accept in that effort to try to create clarity and stability in a situation that is inherently unstable?
