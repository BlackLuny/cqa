Vá até o site:  http://trudelmer.files.wordpress.com/200...    e observe a figura de fundo. Para que lado a mulher gira?      'Segundo alguns estudiosos, se você vê a mulher girando no sentido horário, significa que trabalha mais o lado direito do cérebro. Se, no entanto, você a vê girar no sentido anti-horário, utiliza mais o lado esquerdo do cérebro. Fa?a a experiência…      O teste é realmente sensacional. Comecei vendo o giro no sentido horário. Quando come?o a formular mentalmente quest?es matemáticas (que usam o lado racional do cérebro, o esquerdo), imediatamente ela muda o sentido de giro para anti-horário. Se eu come?o a cantar, nova mudan?a para o sentido horário (cantando você usa o lado direito, subjetivo, artístico).      E as alternancias provocadas pelos focos em temas objetivos e subjetivos sempre funcionam conforme indicado no primeiro parágrafo.'   ......

Un amigo es el que te ayuda desinteresadamente y no abusa de tu bondad.       El que con sabios consejos te ayuda a construir y pulir tu personalidad.       Un amigo es el que siendo sincero y leal, te comprende, tiene fe en ti y te acepta como eres.       Aquel que te estimula y elogia, pero sin adularte.       Un amigo es el que estando a tu lado, hace que tu soledad sea mas llevadera       Es, el que goza con tus las alegrías y respetando siempre tu intimidad ,intenta conocer tu dificultad y trata de ayudarte.       El que sin herirte te aclara lo que no entendiste o te saca del error.       El que cuando estas decaído  levanta tu animo y con cuidados y atenciones mitiga el dolor .       El que ve en ti un ser humano con defectos, virtudes, esperanzas, alegrías y debilidades.               En fin, esas han sido mis conclusiones, puedes llamarte amigo?, espero que si.       Saludos.

Alguien me puede ayudar a entener pq la afirmación de que la liquidez actual mantiene bajos los tipos de interés a largo plazo? Entiendo el efecto en los tipos a corto pero no a largo. Mi pregunta se enmarca en el contexto de este texto: "Desde el a?o 2000, los activos financieros en manos de los power brokers se han triplicado, hasta alcanzar los 8.400.000 millones de dólares. Este importe significa poco en términos absolutos (apenas alcanza un 5% de la riqueza financiera global) pero mucho en comparación con otras industrias, como la de los fondos de pensiones y las compa?ías aseguradoras, ya que supone el 40% de su tama?o agregado. La subida del precio del crudo y el boom exportador de los países asiáticos se encontrarían en el origen de un fenómeno que ha permitido situar a China, EAU y Japón como tres de los principales inversores a nivel mundial. Este flujo de liquidez, a su vez, ha ayudado a mantener bajos los tipos de interés a largo " Gracias !!

20080403150704AAP3jdQ	Social Science;Psychology	Is the egocentric based spirit of competition going to ultimately lead to the total annihilation of mankind?	Is what seems to me to have become an obsession with competitive activities which has carried over into the minds of the majority of humans as a way of seeing all relationships with other humans as well as all of life in general, going to lead to the eventual total mutual self destruction of the entire human race? I notice this type of mentality amongst many in my environment. It seems as though they have one overwhelming desire in life which is to either completely conquer others and have them in their complete control or to destroy them if they are unwilling to yield to their control. It seems that these types of people do not have enough intelligence or perhaps it is a special quality of dharma to go with the intelligence to be able to attain what Richard Maurice Bucke called "cosmic consciousness". See here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Buc...  . Without cosmic consciousness egocentric men will not only feel alienated from each other but from their entire environment as well.

I know that when your dreaming your dream is on real time; So if your dream lasts an hour, you were dreaming for an hour. What does it mean when you have really long dreams that feel like that take at least an hour but it only took like 10-15 mins. Last night I woke up after every dream I had for 2 hours straight. Every time I woke up I checked my clock and it was only 10-15 mins. later. All of the dreams I had felt like they took at least an hour each; they were all very detailed and had a lot happened in them, but in reality they were very short. Not only that but as soon as I would wake up I would fall asleep right away, and go straight into a very very deep sleep. I'm so confused I thought you couldn't have such vivid dreams unless your in the last stages of your REM sleep. And you can't just be at the last stages a soon as you fall asleep, each stage takes about 45 mins. So how did I have such vivid dreams and have such a deep sleep in such a short period of time??? Anyone?

20081006093017AAra1gb	Social Science;Psychology	What does this weird dream mean?	Recently my mom passed away. I dream of her often and she is always wearing a red shirt. Is that a symbol of the deceased? In another dream I had last night, and totally unrelated, I was looking in the mirror and I was wearing black, I have long dark hair (in real life) and in my dream. But my face was all wrinkly (I am 26) in the mirror then suddenly it turned into like a Halloween creepy image. I remember thinking to myself in the dream that the wrinkles were just dry skin. LOL, then that's when my face turned creepy.  My eyes got black around them and my hair was extra long and black. What is this supposed to mean?

20090305035300AAHkV70	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Reoccurring dream/nightmare?	At least 3 or 4 times a week I have a nightmare about missing my skating.      I had one earlier this week where me and my brother were in another city asking old ladies skating questions, then it ended up being 10 minutes before my skating time then we ran down the street with my mom and I was balling my eyes out like screaming and my dad drove right by ignoring us.      I had one last night too, my dad promised he would come to the arena and help me with my skates on friday. And I dreamt that I was waiting in the change-room for him and he walked by with his hockey equipment and completely ignored me and went to the next change room and laughed at me (I could see him). Then I had to do up my own and missed the skating.      I also have nightmares about putting my skates on, getting on the ice then taking them off, not having a ride, not having anything to wear etc.      Is this just because I don't want to miss it or does it mean something else?

My neighbor is going threw some real hard times and I often see her like she can't concentrate. she is facing eviction. has a son who just got sent away to prison, she left her husband because he is doing heroine, her youngest daughter lost her job and started smoking with the wrong crowd. and the only brake she gets from her 3 yr old is when I pick her up for play dates. to top it off her mother is always telling her that she is fat and ugly. I feel so bad for her.  she comes over for coffee every day but lately she seems to wonder off in a middle of a conversation. and I often have to repeat myself. And She is constantly praying that she won't take it out on her lil one, her 3 yr old is still on her terrible twos.  she says she is scared she's gonna hurt her child. her home is always full and I can hear everything so I always check in on her.  she told me she has been asking for help in her child school,but that's she a normal kid, I think she is afraid to tell them she needs some kind of help.  she's afraid they are gonna remove the kid. well this is my personal view of her. what should I do?  I don't want to hear about another child dead at the hands of its mother. she is a very caring mother.  very affectionate. Or she might hurt herself.
20081108220321AA0fbIC	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Ive had a dream, and it was weird?	So It started that I was at a high class coffee shop at a table of 7 other strangers. It was like I came with them or something cos' they didn't seem to mind me. I decided to order a scone. And it was good. Then I had a dream in a dream. I was in a park and there was a lonesome lemonade booth/stand that are at fairs and stuff. So my art teacher was running it and he was shutting it down. All of a sudden it started to snow white political yard signs with somebody that had no significance. But I thought it was a beautiful phenomonon. Then My art teacher was collecting them as much as he could as if they were all goina melt and this kind of snow was never going to occure again. Then I went back in my other dream but back in time. I didn't order my scone yet and my teacup was full. Then I spoke for the first time "I think I just had a vision" The peoples reaction were just smiled like it happens to everyone. So I finished my food (yes i reorderd the scone) and I started to walk around this downtown with skyscrapers. I had a feeling like I'm far away (If its a major metropolitan than I am) and homesick. It was like I am gone away and I can't go home for awhile. (ex-college)

The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. With the increasing value of the world of things proceeds in direct proportion to the devaluation of the world of men. Labour produces not only commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a commodity -- and does so in the proportion in which it produces commodities generally.'

20090305045429AAnDCZJ	Social Science;Sociology	Are Females More Mature Than Males?	I know everyone assumes that girls mature much more quickly and therefore are much more mature than boys but is that really true?      For example 13 year old boys act like 13 year old boys whereas 13 year old girls want to go clubbing, date men and start smoking. Everyone says that is because girls mature quicker and want to do grown up things earlier than boys but I think NOT acting your age can sometimes be a sign of immaturity, even if you’re trying act older.       Males probably do have a more childish sense of humour that lasts the majority of our lives (yes we do think farting is funny) but it seems the maturity thing is only based on that. I know plenty of women who still can’t watch a horror film or burst into tears over the tiniest thing and can act very immaturely in matters of love.       I’m not saying men are more mature than women. I just think all things considered we are probably on average the same as each other. What does everyone think?

It's been 7 yrs now since i moved here in the state of CA coming from Sydney. Before i came here, i was seeing someone for about quite some time... not even 3 months we were going out just getting to know a little of each other until that last few weeks before i flew here we kinda had that same mutual feeling for one another. so from there up to my first few months here in CA i tried and tried to work things out with her till i found out she was seeing someone. i know it was kinda hard but i couldn't blame her for doing such thing. i had no choice but to move on... so they went on till lately i caught up with her online, conversation about some stuff catching up on everything then she told me that she and that dude already broke up for about 2-3 months already. And we've been communicating lately for about a month now. but here's the thing. i get up so freaking early in the morning just to catch up with her or sometimes even stay up so late like early morning. But still she's kind of confused of what we're getting into. what she's getting into. i know that she wants to go with this flow but is this right for me and this girl? what is the big deal here? besides, i already told her that im gonna see her so soon in a few months from now...

She in turn was a very frightened, backward child. How do I connect this behavior to the sexual abuse. I have to relate this to a Psychological model.   I hope this is clear. Thanks
