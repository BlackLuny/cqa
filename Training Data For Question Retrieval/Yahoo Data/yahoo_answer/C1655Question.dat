We have talked about marriage so this is a serious relationship. I live in Houston with my family and help them out but I think they will be fine w/o me. The problem is I want to move to be with him and I want to stay here and buy a home. I have money saved and want to buy but I also want to wait for him. If I move i'm scared that I will not find a good job there like I have here. I really miss him and want to be there with him until he finishes school and then we can move together. He has about 2 years to graduation. What should I do? Do you think it would be hard to find a job in San Antonio now with the ecomony so bad? Is is worth spending my money on an apt when I can put that $ into a house here???? I'M CONFUSED!!!

Right now we are torn between getting the 2 hour guided tour of the house (I've never had a guided tour of the house, and I don't like to wear the walkmans that they give out, because it makes the trip feel unpersonal.), or perhaps we should do the Rooftop tour...which would probably be awesome....   any thoughts?   thanks :)

I remember being in Tokyo last winter and walking around different parts of Tokyo. There ARE tons of places to buy food but I can never find a good place to sit down other than McDonald's and some other really fancy/expensive restaurants.      I've also heard that eating food on the go in Japan (other than in amusement parks etc) is considered rude and I do somewhat believe it now because while I was in Japan, I hardly saw anyone eating food while walking or in public.      So how do you find good places to eat in Japan?  We would buy the food but find no where to eat it and we didn't want to go to McDonalds or fancy/expensive restaurants only.

20090226132547AAu9pVB	Travel;Asia Pacific;Japan	Can anyone help point me in the right direction?	I am a Japanese major trying to become a translator/interpreter for the government. I am currently in a community college that does not have any Japanese courses. My plan is to stay there until I get enough credits to transfer to a school with the language, which would take about two years and if I work really hard I might be out by next year. But the problem is I heard that learning a language would take about four to five years to learn and that would mean that I would probably be in school even longer. I heard about Japanese language schools and how it could help someone master the language in about two years. I also heard that there is a test that you have to take to see if you're qualified for translation work, but I don't know much about it. So my question is, should I leave college and attend one of these schools? Will the language schools help me become a translator/interpreter for the government? And is it possible that I can fulfill all of my requirements at the community college and receive my Japanese credits from the language schools? I'm sorry that I am asking a lot, I really need to know this so I can be successful in this field and know how to get there. Answers from translators/interpreters would be well appreciated.

20090226132828AAsnDZa	Travel;Canada;Quebec	Skiing in Québec. Canadians, can I have your help?	My friends and I are planning a senior trip to Canada.  Many of us have studied French so we would like to go somewhere in Québec.        Please advise me on which resorts are best.  Also, which resorts to avoid would be helpful, too.      Please tell me if all of Québec is horrible for skiing. I'd rather know now than get there and it be some shabby resort. Thanks for your time and advice. This will be all of our first time in Canada so we would prefer the resort to be near a large city (without sacrificing the quality of the mountain, of course)

20090226143915AA5KSPr	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	Why is it necessary for Palestinians to enter into The State of Israel?	It is constantly suggested that if all borders were opened so that Palestinians may be able to enter into Israel freely, then no more rockets will be launched and no more suicide bomber attempts will be made.      My questions are:        What business do Palestinians have within the borders of Israel?        Given the circumstances, I should think Palestinians would be afraid of Israelis.  If that is the case, why would Palestinians even want to enter freely into a state that they claim to be their enemy and oppressor?        Furthermore, why were restrictions made on Palestinians in the first place?      Your explanation will be deeply appreciated.      Thank you!

20090226143146AAE7Jz0	Travel;Travel (General);Packing & Preparation	Should I spend the extra money to expedite my passport application?	I am leaving for Japan on a study tour on May 20th. The website says that it presently takes 10-12 weeks for a passport to process (is that accurate?). 12 weeks from tomorrow (when the form will be submitted) happens to be May 22nd.      Should I pay the extra $60 to have it expedited, just because I am cutting things so close? I only found out I had the means to go on this trip last week, and put in my deposit yesterday. Because of how tight I am on money, I don't want to spend the extra $60 if I don't have to, but I'd hate for the passport to just not get here in time.      Obviously, since I am applying for my passport, this is my first time traveling-- any advice at all would be awesome, since I am a dope. ?

20090226151541AACE7WF	Travel;France;Paris	Can you get cashback at a French store / supermarket?	I have a Lloyds TSB cashpoint card on a basic account which means I can only withdraw money from Lloyds TSB cashpoints (even in the UK).        When I am abroad, I can charge things to the card, but I cannot withdraw 'hard cash' from a cashpoint.        I am going to France tomorrow, and I have very little money available - however I get paid on Monday.  Are there places you can get 'cashback' like you can get cashback at the supermarkets over here?  Are there any chain stores where the cashback is offered as standard?  What is the word in French I am looking for?      Many thanks....

I live in Vancouver Canada (west coast) and would love to have a destination wedding somewhere in the Caribbean, or somewhere with similar coastlines. (east coast of mexico)      My biggest issue is that I want our closer family to join us and I would like to keep the costs down, without risking anyone's health due to poor resort conditions.  so 3+ star ALL INCLUSIVE accommodations.. nothing less.      This is what I'm looking for, the most important listed first.      *Budget of around 6-7K for my fiancé and me (this is flight, accom,  and wedding pkg)   *guest's budget of around 2k (flight and accom)   *a wedding pkg that will include at least 20 peeps   *kid friendly resort (youngest kid there will be 14mos)   and then it would be nice to have a golf course nearby, and other such activities.       So... can anyone out there tell me of places they've been, and would recommend? Anywhere you'd stay away from?   Any extra tips to getting married in another country?      thanks for all of your help!
