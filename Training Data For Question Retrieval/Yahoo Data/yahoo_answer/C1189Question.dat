20090128152711AAlh6Yg	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Wrong section!! guy troubles!! help?	so i really like this guy and i think he like really likes me too. he is always playing with my hair and twirling it and he's always finding excuses to touch me. i think he loves me because he said i love you to me once but idk if he meant it. he didnt laugh he looked serious when he said it. and he was looking in my eyes and stuff. so question #1 is do you think he meant it and does he love me??? i love him too. Also, he hasnt asked me out yet (well not formally but he asked me like do you want to go to the movies and i went with him but still does that even count?). so how do i get from friend stage to more then friend stage??? i love him and its really annoying that ik he loves me but he hasnt made a "move" yet. Did he mean it when he said i love you or not?

20090225143726AAFwN4y	Beauty & Style;Hair	How can I get my hair curly?	Hi, I am mixed race and though I dont have afro hair its very thick. It used to be very curly and is now naturally wavy, but I did use to be able to get it very curly when i used mousse and a diffuser. BUT since exposing it to the evil that is GHD's it wont curl anymore! Ive tried stoping using the GHD's altogether but after a month it still didnt work and I cant go round with hair neither straight nor curly it looks awful. Are there any tongs that actually work, bearing in mind GHD's are the pnly straighteners that come close to working on my hair, so any tongs would have to be as good. Or preferably, are there any products I could use that would help it curl with the diffuser, like a serum, mouse, spray etc? thnx

20090225142546AAqoWCO	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Laser Hair removal for face requires shaving but...doesn't that make the facial hair coarser?	I just began a facial hair removal (only on my first treatment) and I was told it would work better if the area would be shaved and I was concerned it would make matters worse but I was told the laser would work better if I would allow them to shave me prior to the treatment so I allowed them to shave me. The texture of my facial hair prior to the laser treatment was very fine "peach fuzz" and now after the shaving and laser treatment my face feels very "sandy" (the hair texture seems thicker even though I can't see the hair without a magnifying glass) Now I'm about to start the second session but because I have noticed the hairs (while not visible) feel coarser, I don't know whether I should allow them to shave me again? Will the hair eventually get finer?       If you've had facial laser hair removal, what has been your experience? Have you been shaved? and ultimately has your facial hair disappeared?  I just don't want to end up worse off (ahh all in the name of vanity LOL)      Your input will be highly valued and appreciated~

20090128170556AA3klQo	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Black Henna tattoo's with PPD?	I read somewhere that if you had a bad reaction to a black henna tattoo (with PPD in it) you would never be able to dye your hair, wear most makeup, or take most medicines ending in "-cain".  Snopes.com classifies this as "true."        I got one several years ago.  It went away after about a week, but I'd had an allergic reaction to it that included itching and redness at the site.  The redness (in exactly the pattern of the tattoo) lasted about 1 week longer than the tattoo itself.      So my question is:  Is it safe to get a real tattoo after having a bad reaction to a black henna tattoo?

My hair's texture is really soft and everyone loves the feeling of it but i hate that its so flat and straight. I never in my life used a straighter on my hair cuz my hair is already so straight.. i come out the shower and its straight. I tried using John Frieda voluminous shampoo and the moose but it doesnt work on my hair.. its still flat.  I tried blowing it upside down after taking a shower but it still doesnt have volume in it. Teasing my hair takes time and i hate the tangles. Is there anything else i can do to make my hair have more volume? Thanks.
20090128174640AAdb1yR	Beauty & Style;Hair	Please answer this - especially if you are a hairdresser or study hair!! Thanks!?	Okay, so.   I have thick, curly, frizzy hair.   I have tried almost every shampoo and conditioner, and nothing works.   Nothing.   When i get out of the shower and my hair's wet, it's like really soft and shiny and nice but then when it dries it's really gross and frizzy.   I try straightening it, but it's never good.   My hair is only good if i get it blow dried and straightened at the hairdressers and I do not want to pay $40 everyday to get my hair done.   Is there any products in Australia that I can use that will help my hair?   Shampoos, conditioners, repair masks, leave in conditioners, straightening heat protector, zero frizz hair stuff.   Anything.   Please recommend products and brands aswell.   I'm desperate for help!!!      Thanks xo

I want to buy a new bra but i want one that gives cleavage I'm a B34 and I think my boobs are too far apart because whenever I buy a bra even a push up my boobs aren't pushed up I don't know whats wrong.

I used to be ... fat.  all the excess weight went to my growth spurt [which explained why I could lose any wieght when i was fat at the time.]  well anyways, my breasts were full B cups but they've shrunk to smaller Bs. They are still big enough that they won't fit into a A cup.  I'm 5'9' and I have hardly any meat on my thick bones except for a nice butt and alittle on my tummy but that's about it. both my mom and mother and grandmother has either full Bs or Cs!    I'm getting all my genes from my dad's side, meaning my grandmother with her C's so what can I do regain my breasts? or even get fuller breasts?     I do push ups and weight training but it doesn't help and i do not ever want to go under the knife for breasts!    PLEASE HELP ME!

The 3 I have in each ear only hurted for a few seconds, then it was fine. I always work myself up and get so scared, for usually nothing! Anyways, Im wondering a few things...      1. Which ear do you think looks better? Im thinking about my left because I sleep on my right side, but which do you think looks better?      2. Does it really hurt as much as some people say? I have looked on the internet and most people say its not that bad, but some people say its horrible.. what do you think?      3. Could I use numbing cream to reduce the pain? I know I probably could handle it without it, because all of my other ones werent bad, but Im just wondering if that would help at all. I probably wouldn't end up using this, but Im wondering if it would help at all?      4. Should you use a needle or a gun, to get it peirced?            Thank you to anyone who answers! Sorry if theyre stupid questions im just wondering alot!
