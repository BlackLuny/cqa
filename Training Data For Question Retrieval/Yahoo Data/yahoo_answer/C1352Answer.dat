un0C52G8aa	Not at all. She's big on telling other women how to live their lives but has hardly lived by those examples. She tells other women their place is in the home and that they don't need to get an education or have a career. This is from a woman who has three college degrees, has run for elected office, and often missed her children's school events because she was too busy with her other activities. She may portray herself as being the epitome of being maternal and nurturing but according to accounts I've read on her, she was a cold, domineering mother who hen-pecked her husband and was more concerned with having her daughters marry well and improving their social status than having careers. She also has a gay son named John that she is deeply embarrassed about. In interviews, she acts all flustered and tries to dodge the subject when she is asked about him    She sounds like someone who would have been happier if she had stayed a single career woman but who was born in the wrong era so she was expected to get married and have children whether she wanted to or not. A woman who didn't get married may have had more personal freedoms but also was viewed unfavorably by society. That's why never-married women are often called "old maids", "spinsters", and "crones" even to this day.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Here's what makes her weak-minded. She graduated Harvard in 1945 and got a law degree from Washington University, then wrote nine books and ran for Congress twice, all the while spearheading a grassroots effort to encourage women not to do any of those things for the sake of their femininity. If there was a Nobel Prize for hypocrisy, she could have that.    EDIT: That's what she believes. That doesn't make it true.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I'm not surprised you'd want her to win a Nobel Peace Prize.  I mean she's a weak-minded, sexist pig of a woman.  What's not for you to love?    EDIT: So sorry, I didn't realize that having a degree makes you strong-minded or filled to the brim with common sense.    I'm sure the nuts on Wall Street that screwed up our economy didn't have degrees, right?  Didn't George W. Bush graduate from an Ivy League school?  What is your point?    EDIT: Don't even pretend that conservatives don't see liberals as weak-minded.  I don't think she's 'bad'; I think she set the women's movement back lightyears.    EDIT: Reading 50 books in a year is an accomplishment?  No Child Left Behind, indeed.    EDIT: And I never said that she was small-minded because she was conservative.  There are many, many intelligent people out there whose views I don't agree on.  She's not one of them.    EDIT: Let me get this straight: You've NEVER criticized anyone who's more "accomplished" than you are?  You've never said anything against a politician, a professor, etc?  I'm supposed to blindly support someone because they have a degree?  What does having a degree have to do with whether I agree with you or not?      And who said that 'leading' the free world wasn't an accomplishment?  I said that reading 50 books in a year is hardly something to pat yourself on the back over.    "Would I call somebody who is more intelligent and accomplished than me "weak-minded" regardless of their political persuasion? Of course not."    ...so because YOU won't, then I can't?

IbJ2O0vpaa	While I'd guess they reinforce each other, there's obviously a difference. Self-esteem refers to how much one values oneself as a person, which doesn't necessarily lead to confidence. Confidence refers to how much one believes oneself to be capable of particular tasks.  I could think I'm a worthless person but be confident of my social or athletic or career abilities.  I could love myself to death but lack confidence in many areas.    It's a bad week to ask me about either, but I think I have reasonable amounts of each.|`|LGkb4xibaa	i'd say you've pretty much summed them up. Confidence is more about worrying what others think.

I'll try to block mine in the shower, using various bottles.

I think that it's normal to be afraid of something when you're in the mindset, "Hey, what if what's reflected in that mirror isn't good? What if it hurts me?" <br>  <br>  It doesn't help that so many horror movies use mirrors to their advantages. None come to mind that don't involve a mirror in which something horrible is reflected with a character/ as a character. <br>  <br>  Now if this bothers you this much, perhaps you should speak to a professional about it. <br>  a.)

F6uAWBluaa	child custody is based on "best interest of the child", which has several factors, primarily "primary caregiver" is used though and often enough the primary caregiver was the woman. when men seek custody, the rate is as high as 70%. many dont bother to seek custody b/c they assume the woman can do the better job (this is social and cultural). however, men do get custody. <br>  <a href="http://family.findlaw.com/child-custody/custody-forms/state-child-custody-laws.html" rel="nofollow">http://family.findlaw.com/child-custody/...</a><br>  <br>  In regard to men's social expectations - they are expected to be strong, hide their feelings, excel in sports, be ambitious, bring home the bacon. <br>  <br>  personally, as a woman, i think men's roles are very restricted and there needs to be a liberation. personally, i'd like to see men be more  open and sensitive. my friend is upset that her 7 year old son is sensitive. i cant believe it. any mother should be happy. it really bothers me. she & her husband try to *teach* him to be tougher - nurture, not nature. this teaches the child that being sensitive is bad and this is a form of intolerance and bias.|`|PbowWcKRaa	Male or female, I think things like social class, education and criminal record have much more of an impact on people than their gender. Everyone knows men and women, but not everyone knows someone from a different background or someone with a criminal record. I think if a judge had to decide who to give custody of a child to between a male with a nice job, nice family, and a female who used to shoplift and couldn't afford to look after a child, the choice is obvious. Even a male and a female who were living almost identical lives, it might come down to one factor that makes the judge decide. 'Courts' consist of a jury, but judges have the overall decision on the outcome, and judges are intelligent people, the fact that many people think the law unfairly supports women most likely comes from the fact that in cases where the male and female are both adequate parents, a judge might give custody to the female, but a lot of people then don't acknowledge that males are often given certain rights that allow them to spend time with the children.|`|EMhhxyTraa	I think we're all restricted and defined by social expectations, regardless of race, gender, nationality, or the like. Men specifically I suppose are encouraged to be insensitive, aggressive, powerful creatures who are the primary providers in the family unit. It is generally expected that they be assertive and ambitious and competitive. They should be womanizers and confident around the opposite sex; that without sexual virility and prowess they are incomplete men. They should ultimately be 'strong' masculine protectors. I think the overall social pressure on men of many cultures seems to be the same: to be a leader, to be power-driven, sexually competent, and impervious to life's hardships.|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	Well men are already screwed from the start in most cases involving abuse.

Put in terms of body language though, the factors influencing society’s expectations for men and women vary tremendously across cultures, industries, geographical areas, and even within families. What was very cut and dried a century ago is now wide open for changing interpretation.<br>  <br>  The Traditional Role of Body Language<br>  Men and women have been using body language to communicate with each other for thousands and thousands of years, if not even longer. For most of that time, however, society’s expectations for proper male and female roles were narrow enough that only a narrow range of body language was typically required.<br>  <br>  The traditional Western view of gender roles was that men were the family ‘breadwinners’ and women were the family ‘caregivers’. Within these roles, the majority of body language occurred to support and fulfil expectations of these roles. For instance, men used their body language to compete for wives, jobs, dominance, and the like. Women, on the other hand, used their body language to compete for husbands, nurture children, show submission, and the like.<br>  <br>  These are extremely broad stereotypes, of course, but the rigors of life dictated that the majority of time and energy be focused on simply surviving rather than engaging in more sophisticated forms of communication.<br>  <br>  Changing Gender Roles Challenge Society’s Expectations<br>  As the world modernised, traditional gender roles began to change. Women expanded into traditionally male roles and men had to adapt to these changes in the workplace and at home. What used to be very predictable – get married, man supports the family, woman tends to home and children – became much less so. The kinds of body language and non-verbal cues that society expected from men and women had to change as well.<br>  <br>  Think about something as simple as a woman going to work in an office environment. The issues related to body language are huge, such as:<br>  <br>      * Men and women interacting professionally rather than romantically<br>      * Men and women balancing dominance vs. submission<br>      * Men and women with different interpretations of body language, such as touching, smiling, and the like <br>  <br>  These are just a very few examples; can you think of others to add to this list?<br>  <br>  More Body Language Than Ever<br>  Over time, as society modernised and people were better able to devote time and energy to things beyond simply surviving, the use and meaning of body language expanded dramatically. Men and women were able to spend more time interacting in business, recreation, entertainment, and general social situations. Since body language differs so tremendously in these different situations, it only makes sense that the body language ‘vocabulary’ of men and women began to expand.<br>  <br>  For instance, think about men and women sitting in a bar having a drink. A century ago, it would have been unthinkable for a reputable woman to do this, but now it’s common and accepted. Now think about how this change in society’s expectations has also changed body language. In modern times, a woman entering a bar will carry herself with confidence, comfort, and freely make eye contact with other patrons regardless of their gender. A man in the bar might not even notice her coming in, or if he does notice her, is likely to be comfortable making eye contact and expressing other positive body language.<br>  <br>  But what about the woman from one hundred years ago? Chances are if she even entered the bar at all, her body language was tentative, uncomfortable, and included very little eye contact. A man in the bar would instantly notice her because her presence would be a rarity, and his body language would likely be more focused on protecting her from other men and getting her out of the bar.<br>  <br>  Although society’s expectations for men and women have changed a great deal, they still tend to lag behind actual activity. In other words, the men and women who pioneer new roles for their gender often deal with ‘old’ social expectations as they blaze a new trail. Their persistence, though, eventually nudge society’s expectations along the way.|`|zXPGm2fraa	The biggest restrictions on men that I know are put on them by other men, and they are so contradictory to each other I don't know how some guys survive them, like having to be as loyal as a dog to their male friends (even if that "friend" screwed them royally) and above and beyond their significant other, which is a major disrespect to the guy who CHOSE their S.O. to have a life with ( a real friend would be happy for and supportive of the love of their friend's life, it's so stupid). Or having to be extremely responsible employees, employers, public servants, and at the same time be "cool" and "party" with anyone who asks them to or they're not "cool" anymore. I see men as having a huge amount of peer pressure to deal with.
nkTKIXcBaa	Huh, interesting question... I can think of 2 possibilities<br>  <br>  First, when I close my eyes, it's not actually black - hard to describe, but definitely not black. I think more like a mix of black and white, except I can't tell which parts are white and which parts are black at any given time - maybe it's like that.<br>  <br>  Second, maybe they just don't have any sensation of seeing at all. As in the same way an amputee feels about their leg which isn't there? It's hard to imagine, but I think I can understand it a little bit.<br>  <br>  I imagine that what they "see" would be different depending on why they're blind, too. For example, if they were blind because their rod and cone cells don't work, what they see is different than what someone who's blind because the part of their brain that interprets visual input is broken sees. Also, someone who's been blind from birth would likely see differently from someone who became blind later on. I don't know if a person who has been blind since birth would be able to visualize anything... that's an interesting question too... and you know what else I've been wondering? How would you describe color to a person who's always been blind?<br>  <br>  edit://<br>  Hah, you were a smart 3rd grader.

uxwSd0KLaa	The answer is no ; one of my friend cannot even deal with someone who is angry ; so can you picture this person violent ? No|`|4wLbuw1baa	Lord of the Flies was influenced by two philosophers: Hobbes & Rousseau (sp?). According to Thomas Hobbes, humans are violent by nature and a strict government is required to control them, else they would be savages. Rousseau stated that humans are born innocent and that it is only when humans are governed that they become terrible people.<br>  This is evident between the two groups throughout the book. Jack's group is more "savage", but somewhat more peaceful. Ralph's group is more organized & civilized.<br>  On the ACTUAL question though: all human beings can be capeable of violent behavior. Civilization assumes, however, that you are not a violent person. Without people to impress upon you what is "right" and "wrong",  you are left to your own primal instincts.<br>  Look at wolves: you may consider their actions to be violent, but they don't think so. They're either defending territory or out to get food (or they're rabid).<br>  Hope I've helped|`|hxxOIm1Maa	Yes. The difference is that there are twisted minds that can not control their emotions and get worse when they let their minds get infected by media. Because there are violence in movies, games that are like fertilizers to these minds and it get worse when there are no parents controlling their children. So everyone is capable, but only sick minds are incapable to control those outburst of violent behavior.|`|AA10013593	i would say yes ! it depends a lot on the situation but everyone has a violent response  "button". even those of us who say oh no never me! well yep they do. heres an example : <br>  a catholic nun, someone for whom violence is not a life syle,  in front of her, grab the statues from the niche, begin to throw it in the church  and suddenly this woman is a flying maniac.  a woman with a baby- threaten it , grab it and you risk your life. there are various 'buttons" with assorted thresholds that you would have to reach , but everyone has their violent point. interview people from different walks of life , and you'll see what i mean. heck even a baby has a v.point. try taking the lollipop out of a kids mouth and along with the screams , if they are mobile they will attack you for it back.|`|CXgPkEPFaa	yes everyone if they get pushed to certain limits.|`|Het9lG90aa	do your own homework<br>  <br>  hahahahaha<br>  <br>  just kiddding <br>  <br>  i post stuff like this all the time

The film on the windows represents the blinded deception that we have come to accept.  The real questions are outside of the box where life really exists.  The force and control that was applied to you when you left your seat is proof of the mindset that those in power do not want to you know more than them.  The false sense of fear that they tried to instill in each kid was a weapon used against the kids to exploit their minds to a dullness to the point of ineffectiveness.   The message to you here is that you need to step out of the boundaries of what you know and believe to be true and let the God of you and creation teach those things that are there and free for your learning.  Wisdom and Understanding are your...you just need to pursue it.<br>  <br>  Cheers!

It seems kind of like a legend to me... In any case, I would argue that women commit suicide not because of 'unwanted pregnancies' but because of the social stigma that went with being pregnant at a bad time or because the baby tied them to a man who was a less than idea partner. I've talked to many women who have had abortions, and it's almost never because they hated the idea of the pregnancy itself. In every case it was because of social rejection or fear of being tied to the father.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Women who got pregnant out of wedlock might have committed suicide sometimes.  But women quite often gave birth to babies and then either killed them or abandoned them. Quite often they were thrown onto rubbish dumps.

F08qx2hgaa	Hey there. <br>  <br>  A good part of being confident with others is being confident with yourself. If you're very self-conscious, it'll be harder to talk to others. It's like you have to impress them every time you talk to them. You have to prove yourself. Some people can get past these feelings and can talk on and on without worry.<br>  <br>   Those people then turn to belittling others, for they still feel bad about themselves.<br>  <br>  Be careful when finding your confidence. Find it in what others say to compliment you and what you are capable of doing.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  Okay now, another thing that really helps is being in high spirits when you're about to talk to someone. Have you ever felt a rush of adrenaline-like happiness after getting praise or accomplishing something? Take that energy and use it to talk to someone. It's easier to talk to someone when you're in high spirits.<br>  <br>  Again, this is something that is difficult to some people, especially with personal conflicts in their lives that keep them down.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  Join a... speech class. No, I'm kidding. Gosh that'd be drastic. Join a club, depending on what you're into. People will talk to YOU if you have similar interests, and you'll have urges to talk to them about those things too.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Make goals for yourself, and work on them little by little. Say, "If I can say hi to 10 people today, I'll get myself a coffee after work/school", some sort of positive reenforcement. Just don't get frusterated if you can't do this right away- it'll take time.<br>  <br>  ------<br>  <br>  Once you have a conversation started with someone, it won't be as hard to keep talking. As you learn to talk more with people, you'll find that you don't need as much effort to talk. Remember to be yourself, and talk to a relative or counsler about it if it really bothers you.|`|UetuwbYnaa	trust me i had to go threw the same thing. just go out there and say hi and make a nice compliment to them like hi thats a nice shirt or nice hair. then the person your talking to well say thanks and just keep the conversation going. i hope i helped .|`|qGh1HhPwaa	Push yourself starting with increasing talking to close family, then family, then ask questions of strangers/<br>  Work your way up|`|n2y17YsOaa	Just do it.

Sadly fate had other plans for him.  I will never know the whys or wherefores of such a thing as death at an early age. That is the mystery of life. But I do believe we live on and carry on.  Take comfort in the fact that what is gone from the earth, is not gone from our memories or heart.  <br>  <br>  A couple weeks ago I had a dream about my father who passed thru to the other side over 2 years ago.  In it, I was at my grandmother's who was an amazing Southern cook and making Thanksgiving dinner.  I cried when I saw my father and knew he was not alive and told him how much I loved him.  What I didn't realize in the dream was that my dear loving wonderful grandmother is also deceased and she was making the meal that brought a fractured and fractious family together.  My grandmother was the glue that kept the family together and often the unsung hero of the story.  I cried when I woke up from the dream to realize they were both beyond the rainbow but they were tears of joyful remembrance and I do believe they broke thru to spend an evening with me and I cherish that.<br>  <br>  God bless.

I have this thing where I do not like people to look at me. I hate it when people look at me. i can deal with it if I am with friends and/or family because I have to deal with it.<br>  But if I stand in front of a class room, I will freak and try to leave so sadly, I would be the chick in the corner at social events.|`|4DGWcaFLaa	I honestly don't know when I'm -not- being myself...? I don't really care; I let things flow naturally from me. Even when I'm trying to be polite or appropriate during a formal event, I'm still just being my own self. <br>  <br>  My friends think I'm weird, but they seem to appreciate my authenticity anyway.

I guess when I'm around people I don't know all that well makes it harder.  I tend to be sarcastic sometimes and there are some people who just don't appreciate sarcasm so I have to tone it down.  <br>  <br>  I'm extremely impatient so when I'm with people who just don't seem to get it or when I'm around loud obnoxious people I have to work harder to be nice. <br>  <br>  For the most part though what you see is what you get.|`|2C1C3Zfyaa	I know that everyone tells you to be yourself. But there are uncomfortable times when I choose not to. Or not completely myself. I more hide my embarrasing and unique things from everyone and keep quiet. Mostly when I am around my best friends I am myself but even then I hold back, so I suppose the only person in the world that I really am myself around is my boyfriend (husband to be). I don't see anything wrong with it though because it hurts my feelings if people look at me funny for acting out, and most people are not socially prepared for the whole truth about everyone.|`|dQivqfRuaa	Usually in public.

cCKASg4Waa	I'm a male non-feminist and I'm having a little trouble with the premise of the question itself, because I don't think Asian & Brazilian women's butt sizes can really be placed in the same category. Brazilian women are known for having very round, plump buttocks... while Asian women are known to be flat.<br>  <br>  I will say that Caucasian women have more fat in that area than Asian women, but not Brazilian women.|`|HbQmDGb6aa	Not this causasian lady. I'm a size 1... what I would give for those Brazilian type thighs...<br>  As a whole, I'd have to say Asian women even make me look curvy. <br>  <br>  The stereotype's the beautiful, sexy, Brazillian curves, the skinny Asian woman, the fat obese American woman...... and techically, I bet the number of obese Caucasian women add up to bigger thighs and butts than any other ethnicity of women. <br>  <br>  I'm 22, female, not a feminist|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Just the thighs and butt?<br>  If the caucasian lady is American, she's probably got more fat throughout her entire body than a typical Asian or Brazilian combined!<br>  <br>  Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in America.<br>  <br>  I'm female, and neutral when it comes to gender related issues.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	i am male 35/ regular dude (not a feminist nor an anti feminist)<br>  <br>  and i only go for women 18-25. no one else. no one else i say!|`|wRLidVqkaa	Well I am Portraguese and I have fairly big hip to waist ratio, compared to what Caucasian women aspire to. Recently going over to Brazil with my family the women there tend to be bottom heavy but they look great, I've always though bigger hips and a small waist was the sexiest look (my opinion.) You know like Monica Bellucci, I don't think this a racial thing, I think it just comes down to a persons genes. My mother has nice big hips and boobs with a tiny little waist.<br>  <br>  Seriously though, the Portraguese women I know don't want to be classed as skinny, they like having 'womanly curves.'|`|tyuxbdrnaa	Have you ever seen an Asian woman with an ounce of fat on her @ss?<br>  Then you have Brazilian women, who are known for their voluptuous, sexy bodies.<br>  (I'm assuming you chose these ethnicity's at random).<br>  Me...I'm Caucasian,(Italian) non-feminist, dangerous feminine curves,<br>   I put the gggrrrrrrr  in girl, with my plump @ss..and...uh... <br>  What's your point?!<br>  <br>  Edit: Thanks, Winter Glory...<br>  way to perpetuate the stereotype. <br>  Just for the record,. not all Americans, fall into that category.<br>  Here in California, many of us see Fitness as a way of life.<br>  The Equalist's answer is spot on!|`|2E74C4gpaa	There are Caucasian women with relatively large buttocks but Black females and Latino women are historically known to have large butts.|`|srIMFTb8aa	Not in my case.<br>  <br>  And haven't you ever heard of the famous Brazilian bunda?|`|f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	In my case: TRUE!!<br>  <br>  What does feminism have to do with this question?

I said it!|`|svOneExjaa	LOL. Asian ladies tend to look like teenage boys throughout their entire lives. Not all of them, but most. Sorry to say. However, I still don't consider that a compliment to their femininity.  Now, when it comes to Brazilian ladies, they are famous for their larger behinds and thighs. It is considered very sexy in their part of the world and ours these days, courtesy JLo. Now, SOME Caucasian American ladies of all ages are proud owners of healthy/ heavier backsides and thighs. It is still considered the biggest turn on by many males in most cultures. However, to our daily regrets most of us don't have ENOUGH of fat back there to speak of... So, don't you worry about how much fat ladies carry around; the size of their behinds is not the reason why they keep rejecting your advances. The reason for it is their good taste in men.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I wouldn't say so, at all. <br>  <br>  You already know my stats.

Just random things from the past that I think of and go noooo why did I say/do that.... I think it might be a lack of sleep too...Good question.|`|6GmtcZteaa	Yea. We feel more. we use more feelings than we use logic. we imagine and interpret things in our own way. we sense alot and the people around us. it is more easier for us to live in our own worlds due to this, and often might interepret things the wrong way, or get mad at some easily coz it is easier for us to be creative about the problem, so it might depress us.|`|kqXQA2ILaa	no. depression depends on the person.|`|85Co7zE8aa	I think it's because we connect more with other people, so we feel more empathy towards poeple. this means we are emphatic towards depressed people, making it easier for us to experience unexplained depression.|`|992zVXsvaa	This is a good question.

5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	This is an odd question, but interesting. Some women can get away with every other day or so if they have light colored/thin hair.  I have dark hair and light to medium tone skin, so I shave every day. I think it grows slightl less quickly than a guy's facial hair. The big difference I notice between my leg hair and my husband's beard is that the hair on my legs is much finer and is less course than what's on his face.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	I think it depends on the person actually.  I've known guys who have stubble after one day and some who can go a few days.  Same for women.|`|rpajoT0raa	It depends how hairy they are and how dark or light the hair is. I don't need to shave my legs very often - maybe once a week at the most - because it's hardly noticeable and grows very slowly. But I used to live with a northern Japanese girl who shaved herself all over, including her arms and eyebrows, every day. Another girl I lived with used to just bleach the hair, but the hair was so fine she could get away with it.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	Depends on the individual.  My man, for example, if he doesn't shave, he has a very nice and rugged shadow in a matter of hours.  My brother, however, can go a few days without shaving his face.<br>  <br>  I think that often if a woman is wearing a skirt or shorts everyday, then often she will have to shave everyday. Maybe every other day if no ones getting close.  In the winter...well that's another story.|`|AA10584077	Maybe I'm just gross and unkempt, but I shave my legs once every five or six days. It doesn't grow as quickly as the hair on a man's face. By day three without a shave, my boyfriend's face is like sandpaper.|`|AA11850523	depends on heridity|`|AA11313798	It really depends. People are different.  Some guys grow hair faster than other guys.. and same with women (to women). <br>  <br>  I was about to say that I think men grow hair faster than women.. but I wouldn't know for sure because I don't have anything to back it up.. especially when my hair will grow slower than some of my other friends.<br>  <br>  But, I can say from experience, that it makes a difference when I can feel the stubs on my face, compared to the ones on my girlfriend's legs when she didn't shave for a week.  Her legs don't bother me, but my face will be noticeable.<br>  <br>  Not all women shave daily, I know my girlfriend doesn't. And that's perfectly fine..it doesn't bother me.. it'll grow very little. But I do know some homegirls who shave everyday.. just because they like to be very kept.|`|Qk3b5qMxaa	Women don't have to. But, some of us do it anyway, because it makes us feel "feminine". I guess...a guy who shaves his legs probably wouldn't feel more "masculine". Though, I recommend that men shave their armpits just because it's more hygienic.
fDGPbwdsaa	Then I'd suggest you've perhaps been brainwashed into seeing men in that light - as the vast, vast majority of men are not 'violent, aggressive' and so on. Sure, men like to compete (I actually don't - and never understood the whole competition business), but it's that competitive edge that has our world where it is today... look around and see all the amazing tools you have to hand to help make your life easier!!!<br>  <br>  Some groups of individuals who have a problem with men in general like to portray all men as you've described and paint all women as perfect and awesome - far, far 'better' than men.<br>  <br>  But in reality, women have their down side too - just like men do. So why pretend one is 'better' than the other?|`|IwUpusQiaa	it's not weird, it's perfectly fine. you choose who your friends are.<br>  <br>  but i suggest you not shun men because of what you've witnessed in your past male friends/acquaintances.|`|AA10929474	I like hanging out with women as well.|`|fJy0vN7daa	No harm, do what you want. <br>  <br>  But I think your generalisation saying men are too violent, aggressive, and competitive is a little too vague!|`|tIoeOgJ4aa	no you're just heterosocial|`|OTT79NAtaa	Sure, a lot of straight guys feel that way...|`|ZYp1AEspaa	I think it might depend on the society you live in. If you even need to ask if it's considered weird, and you have this impression of men in general, it seems like you maybe are in a very traditional setting (Big Ten football team? Saudi Arabia? Boxing ring?) because otherwise I think you can pretty much be around whoever you like if they want to be around you.|`|AA11313798	No, it's normal. I like being around women, too. lol Plus we've been around that stuff our whole lives. It feels good for a change to be around something different.. and women are lovely. You really get lazy with the whole violent aggressive stuff naw mean.<br>  <br>  And if women like you in their sphere, then thumbs up to you buddy.|`|AA10584077	Yeah, yeah, yeah, "aggressive", "competitive", blah blah...<br>  <br>  Quit putting on airs. You just like hanging out with us because we're ten times raunchier and pervier than your guy friends will ever be.|`|7LSonIoraa	no it not weird but why. but why do you think men are too violent, aggressive, competitive and out to prove themselves all the time.|`|gYbe3BNeaa	Whatever floats your boat.|`|7fwEe9iZaa	you're fine just the way you. i don't think you're weird!|`|jf1f7vNxaa	I'd much rather be the pet man amongst a group of women.<br>  <br>  that would be fun.

I used to be little Ms. Popular until I hit like, 7th grade. Then I started getting shyer and shyer.

XwqePXrOaa	Emotional breakdowns (whether they're crying fits, violent fits of rage, suicide attempts, or any other sort of sudden failure to be able to function like a human adult) aren't admirable things.<br>  <br>  I think the idea of crying-as-positive stems from an overapplication of the idea that men should be encouraged to adopt behaviors that are stereotypically female in order to defeat the stereotypes.  I don't think men should be encouraged to break down emotionally any more than women should be encouraged to be violent - I think these things should be discouraged in both genders.|`|IwUpusQiaa	i wouldn't see them as a "good" person...more like "normal"<br>  <br>  but a man who cries usually shows that he doesn't care about how he is "supposed" to behave (in a macho, manly way...as defined by society/the media) therefore, many people (the ones who aren't ridiculing or simply unfazed) see it as an act of empowerment, and a willingness to put aside pride to show the real you.|`|AA10584077	Crying is a natural act that is still very steeped in gender traditions. When women cry, people see it as fairly common (even though, excuse me, I cry like once every three years), so it isn't regarded with as much weight as when a man cries. When a guy breaks down, people panic and think that he must be at his absolute breaking point if he's showing that much vulnerability out in the open. And to an extent, people are right -- we still socialize men to never show when they're in pain, so the only time that they're willing to expose themselves like that is when they feel really, really at the end of their rope.<br>  <br>  So I suppose that people don't really feel that men are "good people" when they cry, but instead view them as pitiful and needing to be nurtured back to full-strength. Like a baby bird that has fallen out of its nest or something. Anyway, it's not even a universal opinion that men who cry are "good people". There are still a lot of people who regard male tears as disgusting and a sign of weakness. It really depends on who you're talking to.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I don't know.  Personally, I think tears are merely a physical manifestation of emotion, and have no particular significance as regards indicating a person's level of sensitivity, etc.  My husband cries quite easily for instance, whereas I don't cry as easily or as often as he does, but it has nothing to do with him being more sensitive than me.  Some people are simply more lachrymose than others.  Whether a person cries or not is neither here nor there, as far as I am concerned.  In fact, years ago I knew a man who cried very easily indeed, but he was a real Male Chauvinist Pig if ever there was one.|`|pueeMH6gaa	At the school I went to, any guy that got caught crying could expect a severe merciless, and lengthy beating.  Needless to say, crying was at a minimum.|`|jf1f7vNxaa	you got me - on both questions (especially the second)|`|AA11313798	men naturally don't cry and show emotions as much as women, because we don't secrete the same amount of emotional chemicals as women. <br>  <br>  and that's science. i'm not trying to stereotype..but it is sort of a stereotype.<br>  <br>  Anyway, so women get the idea that guys dont have feelings. or are heartless.. or etc.<br>  <br>  so when they finally see a man cry, they think "oh, he's so sweet, he has feelings... see finally a guy who isn't afraid to show how he feels!"<br>  <br>  even though that may be the case...<br>  <br>  some men that cry aren't necessarily a good thing. <br>  <br>  for one, i use to know of a guy that gave his gf/ex gf problems. when he makes a problem, the girl gets upset, but he cries along with his excuses so his gf wouldnt make a big deal about it. gets away with it everytime.. and the girl never understood why she was unhappy in her relationship.<br>  <br>  that's a bad guy that's taking advantage of her<br>  <br>  And anyway, i feel like because women do show more emotions and need someone to confide in, it's good that the men don't cry..just because he should be a shoulder for her to cry on. show empathy, not sympathy.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	If I understand the question correctly, I suppose because they are showing that they have feelings. <br>  <br>  There's a difference, though, between someone crying because he's ashamed of himself, he's done something bad and been caught out (cricketer arrested for bashing girlfriend) and someone crying because he is profoundly moved by someone's suffering or achievement (Kevin Rudd, responding to the bushfires in Victoria).<br>  <br>  The first type of crying is self-pity and does not look good. The second type shows empathy, which is a highly desirable quality in humans. Without it we would all die.|`|rFeF42Wsaa	It may be that they are because that might mean they are more sensitive than normal people and they are more feelingful to the emotions around them.
ZYp1AEspaa	I think it's more complicated than just the home life, but certainly how we are raised and the roles and attitudes we see enacted in our formative years affect us. <br>  <br>  However, we are not compelled to ape every behaviour we witness. Many people grow up to reexamine and rebel against attitudes displayed by their parents. <br>  <br>  Since the home is the first mirror of society, it's very hard to separate out the influence of the two. This is a complex question!|`|YQOT68xFaa	Yes to the first! Society is not misogynistic, but some families certainly are and kids would absolutely pick that attitude up. Ditto with misandry.|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	I'd say yes for both misogyny and misandry.  We usually learn about what to expect from the opposite sex and how to treat them at home.  That said, I've known some people who had some real issues with the opposite sex because of bad relationships. <br>  <br>  Take my dad's childhood friend for example: he was working to put his wife through graduate school (he would have gone to grad school after she got her degree), and she cheated on him with another grad student. He found out because her their 6 year old son walked in on her and the boyfriend. When they divorced, she made him liquidate the family business and give her half the money. He never recovered financially. 15 years later, he remarries. His wife gets cancer and he takes care of her. She takes out credit cards in his name, maxes them out, files for bankruptcy, and then leaves him because he was upset over the financial decisions she had made. He's a bit bitter towards women and I can understand why.|`|rpajoT0raa	From what I've sensed on here, a lot of the misogyny could be attributable to peoples' different cultural backgrounds and religions. This is a global forum - not just USA - and western countries have a lot of immigrants from the developing world as well. Let's face it - in general, men from most countries around the world just don't have much respect for women and were not raised to regard them as their equals. Misandry, in general, is just an extreme frustrated reaction to misogyny... <br>  <br>  ...but it doesn't take very much to be incorrectly labeled as a man-hater.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	No, I dare say most misogyny comes from an over domineering mother figure.<br>  <br>  When I was pro-feminist, I grew up listening to a fair amount of man-bashing "men.. all the damn same... all bastards... " etc.<br>  <br>  I grew up fearing adulthood... knowing I would turn into a 'orrible man.<br>  <br>  I figured the best way to stop being hated, was to be a pushover - or pro feminist.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter though, those who hate men - simply hate men. Sure, they may put on a polite face of civility for those few men who, like me, were pretty much bullied into pro feminism... but underneath, hate remains as hate.|`|z60J0Z9Daa	Well the first place we learn how to interact with the opposite gender is by watching our parents.  We take in a lot from those years. <br>  So yes, if a son grows up watching his mother not being treated equally by his father his is very likely to think that this is acceptable behavior and how he should treat future women.|`|OTT79NAtaa	Not necessarily. There had to be initial misogynists, right? Where did the idea come from in the first place?|`|T6xd0OxWaa	For both misandry and misogyny it could be learned as a kid or it could develop later in life.<br>  <br>  It could develop from someone having a parent of the oppiste sex that was abusive towards them, or it could be they were bullied, teased,  picked on etc.    It could be they were assaulted, raped, beaten, etc.<br>  <br>  It could be any number of things.|`|fJy0vN7daa	Well kids learn what their parents teach them. If the parents were teaching them lack of respect to women or men there is a strong possibility the child will end up the same way.<br>  <br>  Although there are exceptions to this, sometimes it turns out the other way around. <br>  <br>  But in general, people are brought up being a misandrist or misogynist but during their life some learn right from wrong. It's wrong to hate someone because of gender. <br>  <br>  How you grow up affects you a lot but it's not always the case.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Possibly.  It could also come from a kid being raised in a household where the mother didn't show the father any respect, and the kid grows up having a complete disdain for his/her mother as a result, and then projects that onto all women.|`|jf1f7vNxaa	Studies show that a boy raised in a home where the father was henpecked and mocked by the mother will grow up to be henpecked and mocked as well.|`|tcY0jnmMaa	It all goes back to how you were raised and life experience shapes and molds your thinking... that's the bottom line both parents instilled in all of their children... to do something and be something.. bottom line|`|G0DP4LSmaa	I don't think it is causal in that respect at all<br>  <br>  Some male kids in a home like that could grow up and be extremely pro-women simply because their mother was treated badly|`|Qk3b5qMxaa	I think a man who has grown up in houshold with a mother who did not have any self-respect will have a hard time respecting women. But, not all men who have lived in an abusive household become abusive;  those who are open-minded,introspective and self-aware will always find a way to expand their knowledge.<br>  <br>   Edit: Hoseholds with domineering wives are very rare. Though, they are becoming more frequent in the twenty-first century. Women who have lived in households where the father was disrespected will also propably emulate what is familiar to them in their future relationships. I.e. they are domineering, demanding, controlling, etc... <br>  <br>  Children are like sponges, they pick up what they see very quickly.
mHQN3Ml6aa	Stories that scare me, are ones that twist real, everyday things into surreal events.   And creepy children are scary too.  The Exorcist is the scariest thing I ever saw.|`|ncSd9jXDaa	you need to play with the mind, not with their sight<br>  <br>  <br>  seeing decapitated heads in a room isnt as scary as taking a friend to the movies and nearly hitting a guy on the side of the road and seeing him walk into the theater an hour later|`|Lnw6ZYMoaa	It depends on the person. Everybody has their own personal fears. To truly scare a person you need to dig deep for something that truly scares them that will keep them asleep at night. When you figure out what that thing is, it's easier from there. It doesn't has to be gory and nasty, those are usually the shockers. Truly scary stories are the realistic ones.|`|9bSCOZB1aa	The scariest story (or movie for that matter) from what I've experienced is the one that puts the audience in the most realistic of situations. For example; Compare the movies Saw (the first) and One Missed Call.<br>  <br>  One Missed Call focused its entire plot around trying to make the watcher jump, or startle them with certain scenes or try and make certain terrifying images stick in their mind. Well, not only was the movie not scary, they failed at their intentions. (That movie made me laugh.)<br>  <br>  Saw on the other hand wasn't set out to make you jump or startle you. It made you think, anxious to find out the next twist in a realistic plot. You only knew as much as the characters did and at the same pace that they did, being it wasn't predictable at all. The scariest part was that the situations were real. It was all fiction, but it isn't like something of that sort couldn't happen. <br>  <br>  I hope this somewhat helps. The main point I'm trying to get at is put the reader in a realistic situation- make them feel like They're the one chained to a wall or strapped into a death contraption.|`|58a280b909e38ffa527544e0e898256eaa	thank you for asking me , if you want a truly scary story include disturbing things such as godzilla -sized spiders in the house blood sucking rats , flesh eating bugs the like , and include a character say maybe ted walked into a barber shop and sat down for a shave  the barber came the razor met the flesh and he began to cut the customer in two and eat his flesh , stuff like that , also include stuff like a forboding setting    lots of blood and guts oh here is some reccomendations  play resident evil or house of the dead and take notes on the enviroment and setting  i hope this helps if you need any more help contact me at sampedigo@sbcglobal.net thank you very much . oh 1 more thing if you have a profile of slipknot or linkin park that is much appreciated. and make the story really nerve wracking and memorable.|`|85Co7zE8aa	try leaving out too many details, don't go to gory but connect with the reader. imagine the worst scenario of your life, or your own personal hell and portray that. but if you add too much description people get bored, describe eerie things, not random backgrounds.|`|Ia7nddGhaa	Build up a lot of suspense, set a mood and a tone to the story. If you also set them in an eerie setting, the reader might feel more anxious about what is going to take place throughout the story.|`|MAMYF3OCaa	make it realistic, totally true and something anyone can experience. first person is usually better, with raw emotion. describe everything but make it slow and fast at the same time. detail is everything my friend, and the scarier the plot the better the writing can make it.
QQQ36jMOaa	First Class tickets still cost considerably more than coach.  Part of the money goes towards convenience--security line included.  If you have the money, you're paying for that favoritism.<br>  <br>  EDIT--One of my friends work at home land security for an airport so I would have to ask him (because now I'm curious myself) but I'm assuming that they do it to play nice with the airport and air lines.  Perhaps the airlines request home land security to keep the lines and, to maintain good relations, the security allows it.  So I suppose that is a level of favoritism but in the end, the individual is still paying a whole lot of money for it.|`|kOTI6tWgaa	Actually, most people in first class aren't paying more for that ticket.  They are either frequent fliers and upgraded, or someone is buying them last minute full-coach fares (i.e., business - get upgraded anyway).  Also, people with high status in airlines frequent flier status with airlines also get to go in that express lane.<br>  <br>  Mostly, I think it is a perk for those that fly a lot and give a lot of business to airlines or pay more for tickets (don't, it really isn't worth it unless you just can't fit in a coach seat).  Whether it is fair or not is another matter.<br>  <br>  Those that fly a lot tend to like it as they spend a lot of time at airports and like to streamline the process as much as possible.  More and more, no matter who you are, having to go through an airport just isn't much fun.|`|ef89HUefaa	Simple first class pay more money for the flight so they have to get much better services|`|bGsXsDhBaa	I would venture to think that this is an issue managed by the airport management and the airlines whereas the security screening of *all* passengers is the responsibility of the NTSB.<br>  <br>  Airlines have to pay this tax to the NTSB/Homeland Security and levy the charge equally to all passengers<br>  <br>  I doubt if the NTSB/Homeland Security care if first class passengers get an express line - but the airlines and airport management do.<br>  <br>  Just a guess<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: RE your edit. Which is why my answer makes sense. The airport management and airlines organise the perk on behalf of the higher fare paying passengers ... which is what Fereshte said in agreement with me.<br>  <br>  All the above is just my theory. I dunno if I'm right.<br>  <br>  *bats lashes*<br>  <br>  EDIT: I flew first class a few weeks ago and there was no first class express line at security (SFO)|`|ixRkfLjIaa	We pay more than you ham-n-eggers.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	They may not pay more for airline security but they still pay more for the first-class tickets (and the first-class line).|`|AA11850523	I flew 1st class recently<br>   besides the larger seat  and more expensive ticket price was that I boarded just before the coach seating did <br>  I had to go thru the security lines just like everyone else
AA10712251	Women don't look at touching the same way men do. They will rub your arms, your back, or even your chest and  keep it completely innocent. However, if a guy does touch them in the exact same manner that they touch him; he could be asking for trouble. Because women are more willing touch each other,  they often don't differentiate the practice if they think of the guy as a friend.|`|AA10211371	When a woman touches you, you should unzip your fly|`|u9x2KSsZaa	Try to flirt with her, just to test her intention. Remember, a simple touching from a woman doesn't anything to them but a simple touch from us, can get us (men) in lot of troubles|`|gYbe3BNeaa	That would depend on the circumstances, where this "touching" took place and the relationship of the toucher to you.|`|G0DP4LSmaa	You're a bloke?

e2DEQ6Euaa	People all have different tastes. So you like Halo 3 and they like Pokemon. Maybe they like the idea of different strategies by using different pokemon or maybe they just like it because the pokemon are cute. I'm sure you have your own reasons for liking the games you like. Like your last statement says, Halo 3 is manlier than pokemon but most of the interested parties are girls.<br>  <br>  In regards to the shouting, yeah.. I know how you feel. I had to listen to thousands of people arguing about who could pwn who in Dota for like.. forever. But they get their kicks out of it so just let em be :)|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	This is a good question, and it relates to why older people like Twilight or Harry Potter.  Fantasy to me is escapism, and many people just have a lot of time on their hands and an overactive imagination.  One could argue that talking about fantasy basketball or who owns at Halo 3 is equally as wasteful.  Just meaningless hobbies like we all have.<br>  <br>  Spence
cFrtOg45aa	Humour or humor is the tendency of particular cognitive experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement. Many theories exist about what humour is and what social function it serves. People of most ages and cultures respond to humour. The majority of people are able to be amused, to laugh or smile at something funny, and thus they are considered to have a "sense of humour."<br>  <br>  A sense of humour is the ability to experience humour, although the extent to which an individual will find something humorous depends on a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence, and context.|`|mLdlFhyqaa	I think people lose their sense of humour when other people have used their own senses of humour against that person.  Like, if that person has been laughed at and embarrassed publicly and has had traumatic experiences with humour, then it is possible that their sense of humour could be all but dismantled.  They would do this subconsciously in their minds, to help ease the pain of those memories.|`|Lnw6ZYMoaa	I think everyone has some sense of humor, but don't show it around a lot of people. Like the really shy kids at school, for all you know they could be a comedian around their family, you just wouldn't know because they keep to themselves.|`|zrEDyQxGaa	BuzzKillBill,<br>  That was sick, and not funny at all. Go die. <br>  <br>  Yes, it's possible. I swear my english teacher is an Alian--she has ZERO sense of humor.

I may have spelled it wrong.
2GNFQPdmaa	The new deal did some things that worked. It brought electricity to a lot of Americans, it provided a psychological boost to a lot of the poor and unemployed, it instituted a safety net for the first time, it sure as heck made sure Roosevelt got re-elected again and again. <br>  <br>  But if what you mean is, were all of the things it did good and effective? Well no, not all of them. And there's vast disagreements over what was and wasn't.<br>  <br>  If you're asking if the New Deal ended the depression, we'll never know because the war quickly changed the situation for unemployment and production.
wnb0EgaHaa	This is such a funny question, and another example of why it never ceases to fascinate me how our minds work.<br>  <br>  I can't count how many hours of my life I have wasted on key searches, lol.  I can, however, credit my ex with finally resolving that issue for me.  He finally got so fed up about 3 years into our marriage during yet another massive, furniture pulling, cushion tossing, clothes throwing key hunt that he bought and put up a key holder for me.  For months, every day when I walked in, the first question he asked me was "Where are your keys?"<br>  <br>  Lol, if they were not on the key ring, we would find them immediately and put them there.  The ONLY other place I put them was in one specific spot in my purse.  At some point, it actually became an ingrained habit, and key searches are now a part of my distant past.<br>  <br>  However, I used to waitress in college, and there are customers that years later, if I ran into them, I would actually remember what they were wearing, where they sat, and what they ordered.<br>  <br>  Weird selective memory I guess, lol.<br>  <br>  I ALWAYS remember faces and names, but for six months after I got my cell phone, I would have to pull up the number in the phone if someone asked for it, because I had no idea what it was.<br>  Numbers go in one side of my brain and right out the other.|`|SYPcyNoTaa	you memorized your parents phone number.<br>  usually things like keys we don't even pay attention to where we left them which makes is difficult to find them later.  How many times did I lose my keys and try to replay in my head the actions that I took and still don't remember if I went to the kitchen first..or the bedroom.|`|6GmtcZteaa	lOl same here. I don't know what is it. I think we are just too smart ;)|`|Lnw6ZYMoaa	Long term memory versus short term memory.
grXlq18Caa	I'm16 and allowed to date, I dont though cause theres not very many lesbians around here so that kind of eliminated that idea. My sister had her first boyfriend at 14, and then many many more after that.<br>  <br>  I think it just matters how you react to having a signifigant other. If your gonna sleep with someone on the first date, then you shouldnt be allowed to date. Catch my drift?|`|47a351e058b1e2e9d4f9a2bfc0f35883aa	i'm allowed to date and have been since 2nd grade|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	I don't date! nor am i alowed.|`|V780bRMRaa	I don't really know.

But she doesnt remember. Anyway, I am almost 17 and I havent dated anyone nor have I had my first bf or have my first kiss yet. Im waiting for the perfect guy and the right time. It depends on how old your sister is. People were dating back in my middle school so it should be appropriate to tell her that middle schoolers date if shes around that age. I think my friends dated or had bf's back in my elementary days, but it was during the upper grades, 4th and 5th. So it all depends on your sisters age, how she feels about a boy, and her opinions on dating currently.|`|I5ErpeMOaa	I wasn't able to date till I was 15, and still then my parents weren't 100% sure. You don't need to rush into dating because its most likely that you'll find the person you want to marry in college or when you're past 19|`|NIHXUmN1aa	I am older now but being as I was (and still am...haha) a boy I never had any dating age limits...of course I wasn't really into GF's until I was like 14 or 15 I guess so kinda hungout with girls that I kinda consdiered my GF...but I didn't actually "date" until I was 17...well that's when I had my 1st real GF.|`|vAUewI5faa	im not allowed to date but i do it anyway lol<br>  actually i think dating someone 2 years above/below is ok|`|gyoylefvaa	I'm 16 and I don't date! nor am i allowed. until I turn 18.<br>  <br>  Sorry!

AA11962853	I love my Cherokee roots and I love my African American roots.<br>  <br>  I hope you don't take this the wrong way because I ABSOLUTELY understand what you are saying especially with there being an admiration of our facial features, but how much of those women that you mentioned is THEIRS?<br>  <br>  For instance, how many of them straighten their hair? How many get extensions? Perms? Wear wigs? Get botox because they have worn makeup for so long it has caused irregular skin complexion, etc? <br>  <br>  It is so rare...really rare...that I see an African American female with natural hair, no makeup, and loving every minute of it. I happen to be one of those females and it's females like those you mentioned who give the "truly" natural black women a bad rap. <br>  <br>  I guess what I'm trying to say is that, yeah, I agree...certain women should NOT wear their hair braided because braided hair is a cultural artifact and, for those of us who know what they represent and mean, wear them for those reasons and not to become part of the pop culture that seems to be the only culture America cares about. We wear them for reasons that I won't go into here, but it's unfortunate that you don't see more of that. I rest assured knowing that my natural hair and natural skin color CANNOT be "stolen" because it is natural and can't be duplicated.<br>  <br>  I find Whoopi Goldberg, Alice Walker, and the only few more on this list to be extremely beautiful because what makes them beautiful is something natural and not altered. But then again, maybe you don't find these women to be beautiful, which means all of this won't matter to you anyway.<br>  <br>  However, I still understand what you are saying. It's not limited to just white women. Check out Eminem, Justin Timberlake, etc. It's not just looks either, it's music, hair, and other cultural artifacts like braids and locks, dance, etc. No one seems to want to protect these elements. As soon as the meanings of these start changing, maybe we'll see a shift in how black people respond to them being exploited.<br>  <br>  I know this has pissed a few people off, but it's the truth.<br>  <br>  I reported the dude that used a racial slur, by the way. Hope you did too.<br>  <br>  Sidifiri or however it's spelled...obviously that's what's happened now. Don't believe me? Look it up. I already have my royalties from it and it has nothing to do with money. Money doesn't have to be involved for it to be exploitation. I'm addressing this as something that transcends money. Get over it. I hear your argument all the time. It doesn't work then and it aint gonna work now. It's been going on for years. It dates all the way back to Elvis Pressley who is frequently, still, regarded as the king of rock and roll, when really it was and always has been Chuck Berry. But hey, back then it was a bit easier to lay claims on something against a group who was seen as "inferior." Now, the argument goes that it's a contribution to the field...what field? What contribution? Tell you what...do your own experiment...go up to someone white who has locks and ask them what they're called...better yet ask them why they lock their hair. I can almost hear the answers now. The answers of course will do a great disservice to braids and locks. If you can't understand this, then you need to do a little more culture studying. It will help in understanding, at the very least superficially, what I am saying.|`|9240749c186cc50485fb8fcbe650e163aa	I think it is wonderful how we can experiment with our looks, we go through many changes in our one little life.<br>  As long as it does not hurt your body, deform it, cause brain damage, cause mental anguish, cause financial hardship, become addicting and most important hurt your loved ones.<br>  We only have one chance at this little life.|`|6NFQ3pylaa	I don't understand how anyone can "steal" facial features they were born with.|`|mCAWxobNaa	LOL... I don't know if I'm the right one to answer this because I've always been very, very into black girls.  I love their full lips, I love darker skin, just can't exxplain it- I've had very nice experiences with black women.  The only time we had issues was when it came time to bring the white boy over to meet the family.  That was a no-no.  It was the unspoken rule that you don't bring the white boy back to the neighborhood and certainly do not bring him home.  But such is life I suppose.  I felt just as bad for the girl in this case because I know what an awkward position this placed her in, but there was nothing she could do.<br>  <br>  In terms of society's perception of beauty, I'm not sure that I agree with you that black women are considered the last women to pick on a list of beautiful women.  I think if you asked guys about Kerri Washington or ladies like you mentioned or Halle Berry (?sp), then you'd see that an awful lot of guys (including me) would have our jaws on the ground.<br>  <br>  In terms of features, full beautiful lips pretty much appeal to everyone- to guys and girls alike.  If you ever saw Angelina's father, John Voight, as a young man in Midnight Cowboy (1969), you totally beging to see that she got her lips right from him, because he had the same exact appearance of his lips and women found him quite attractive.  Black women have round buttocks' and know how to walk sexy.  It may be a stereotype, but it's what I've found to be the case and I'm most intrigued by black women.<br>  <br>  Whatever public perceptions of beauty used to be, I assure you they will change in short order.  There was a time when Asian women were felt to be "unattractive," in fact the term "mongoloid" was used as a disparaging term to describe a certain look.  Clearly we know that guys certainly like Asian girls (myself included) so I think public perception of what is beauty changes like what's in fshion at a given time.  If I think of the most attractive and sexually interesting women I've seen, I would say that if I wrote down 100 women that I've seen whom I felt were attractive, I bet you that well over half would be black women like Halle Berry, Kerri Washington, Beyonce, Rihanna, Naomi Campbell, (the girl from clueless, the movie), Tyra Banka, Stacey Dashe, Whitney Houston (when she was normal and elegant), etc.|`|svOneExjaa	I don't believe anyone has stolen anything from anyone here. But then I do not see Angelina Jolie as a beautiful woman. It seems like the media decides on someone to play a role of a beauty of their generation, and carries on for years. To me, Beyonce is gorgeous. And the color of her skin has absolutely nothing to do with it. I also don't care much of what other people think about my choice.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Angelina was born with those lips, I've seen pictures of her when she was 10 years old.

To be African? Not all Africans look the same (compare North Africans to West Africans for a dramatic example) and not all black people look the same either. White people also don't look the same. So how are white women stealing their looks from black women when black women don't have a homogeneous cookie cutter look to begin with? Do white women who look different from other white women steal their looks from one another? Do blondes who tan steal their looks from olive skinned white women? Do Mediterranean women dye their hair blonde to look more northern European? <br>  <br>  Do black women straighten and relax their hair to look more Asian? Do Indian women lighten their skin to look more white? Do white women tan to look more black? Do Asian women get eye surgery because they want to "steal" another ethnicity's eye shape? No, I don't think so, most people aren't trying to "steal" another ethnicity's look. Different cultures have different standards of beauty, the reasons for their standards are complex and varied.<br>  <br>  This is a silly and sad question... it reeks of self-esteem issues.|`|9a8dcc5b6d79b07abd75628d8b093129aa	i don't know lol, but people do it all the time, there are also white women and black(mostly white) who want to get Asian eyes and stuff.<br>  <br>  Plain weird, but dunno if it's stealing cuz there are also white people with big lips and stuff, tho it's a characteristic of the black race, it can also be present on other races,|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	Lighter skin is considered prettier in the western beauty culture.

Just because you don't like how White women look like,doesn't mean that other Black women who try and look like the White ones are wrong to do that or are unattractive and all that.If you don't like White women,keep it to yourself.And no,i don't think the White women stole anything from the Black women.We take pride in our looks and don't feel the need to "steal" anything.We're born with whatever face features we naturally have and love it, and we can't help that.So,get over yourself.|`|JITTMjasaa	You also see a lot of black women dressed up to look white in rap videos. What's up with that? No matter what, people will always judge and criticize. I wish we could all be more open. It seems like so many dark women want to be lighter and light women want to be darker. Kind of like the curly haired women wanting straight hair and vice versa. We just need to stop listening to what people tell us to look like and be satisfied for what we are. Most of the ones making us feel bad have a hidden agenda anyway. Maybe if we flaunted our differences they wouldn't be considered so abnormal.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	I don't know about "stole" lips or other features, but it's definitely true that typically non-caucasian features seem to be undervalued when they belong to non-caucasians. Even in this progressive day and age!<br>  <br>  An interesting thing is that Angelina's big lips would have been considered a defect not that long ago. Models from the early 70's often seem to have quite thin lips.<br>  <br>  One of the most attractive things that can happen to humans is when racially distinct features get mixed up in striking ways. Very light eyes in dark skin, for example. All these variations used to be shunned as marks of miscegenation; we are definitely moving beyond that.<br>  <br>  It may not be much consolation to you right now as you dwell on "feature theft," but as the human race evolves it will average out to be  brown-skinned and dark-haired.

Of course, the child could still be deprived by the parent using the gov't money on drugs, but that's something the gov't is trying to crack down on too! As for the people on gov't assistance without children, yes they should be tested.|`|jf1f7vNxaa	Makes sense to me, but there are a lot of things which aren't fair.<br>  <br>  For example, why do first-class airline passengers have a special line at the airport security checkpoint?

urNeu95Saa	Alright brother man....  Complicated question that only you know the answer to.  Might not come to you for a while but this is what I think and know.  I have a PSYCH degree...  All that means is I acknowledge what I don't know....<br>  <br>  Two parts to beauty in my opinion.  <br>  Looks:  it has been studied to death that the people most attractive, physically, are the ones that have good symetry to their face.  If you start paying attention to who LOOKS attractive, you will find some truth to that theory/study.<br>  <br>  Personality:  I know I will get blasted for this but its true also...  for MOST, not all, just MOST, personality is what really brings beauty to a person.  I have been around the world several times (military for 22 years now) and seen MANY different cultures.  The most beautiful people are the ones with the best spirit or personality.  They might look terrible or not that perfect 10 but they are beautiful people.  <br>  <br>  I also have the experience of two "X" wives and have been married to my third wife for over 10 years now.  My first wife, on a scale of 1 to 10 was about a 8 in my book.  Tall and physically attractive.  About a 2 in personallity and character (and we are good freinds to this day, so I am not being spitefull).  My second wife was about a 9.5 for physical beauty and about a 4 for personality (slow learner, me that is, becasue I didn't learn the first time).  Have no idea where she is, my best goes out to her though.  My current wife?  Realistically about a 7 for physical attraction but personality and character, without a doubt, 10.  I am completely happy and life is good!  Oh by the way we have known each other since I was 10 years old.  She was 5 years old at the time and we kinda grew up together, but at that age, in my generation, she was not an intimate consideration.  We were best of friends back then and still to date.<br>  <br>  So, to your quandry...  There is more to attraction than just looks or physical attraction.  Be patient and you will stumble into the person just for you.  I have seen the most beautiful women in the world and MOST of the time they are dumb as rocks, can't think past 5 minutes, can's spell character etc...  That makes them completely unattractive to me.  In fact I can't be around them long because it isn't any fun to have discussions with them, I would get more from a fence post for decent conversation.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!  <br>  <br>  peace|`|0KtFtnZVaa	Attraction has alot to do with chemicals and hormones.....we don't realize how much information we receive on a chemical and subconscious level when we meet a person. <br>  <br>  Often people we are attracted to are people we are actually compatible with on a "breeding" level.

jQFk7KT4aa	I hate to break it to you, but his stimulus plan is 1100 pages long and he didn't even read it.  In fact he gave the Senate 90 minutes to read it before signing and threatened them with marshal law if they didn't.  <br>  <br>  The easiest way to describe it is this.  It creates NO jobs whatsoever, gives billions upon billions to international banks to loan the same money BACK to us at interest.  It gives millions to ACORN, the organization that illegaly signs up dead people and convicts to vote, coincidently he used to be a trial lawyer for ACORN, go figure.  It gives money to Infrastructure such as roads which is a good thing, BUT it doesn't create immediate jobs like a "stimulus" bill is supposed to...in fact most of the infrastructure won't take place until 2011 at the earliest.  It gives more money to welfare and other programs so people can wrench hard earned money out of the hands of the people that actually sweated to earn it.  Its a socialistic, tyrannical bill aimed at crashing the market and put us trillions of MORE dollars in debt.  <br>  <br>  Instead of completing THIS assignment, you should ask your teacher why 21 states have filed for sovereignty and to abolish the Federal Government....Why is Obama creating a 1 million person civil defense force....why are there FEMA camps being built everywhere to house US citizens....why is he trying to ban home-schooling.....why is he trying to ban all privately owned weapons.... why are we sending 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan this week....why did he swear he'd never appoint a lobbyist to office and then elect 3 within his first two weeks of office?

He thinks that by throwing a lot of money into something it'll work out. He spends a lot (in billions) into building roads, bridges and new energy sources because they'll make new jobs. Nice and all, but once the things are built they'll be jobless again. <br>  <br>  In other words, Obama only got into office because "he's a hip young black guy" while McCain is "Old, white, and bald."

I haven't seen any plan to create jobs|`|biPiIIeMaa	It's all just politics- looking like he's doing something when all it accomplishes is further expense, but at least it looks like he cares and is trying to work for the good of the people as a whole while simultaneously using the situation as an excuse to initiate socialistic methods. He is basically trying to copy what FDR did in the Great Depression, which only succeeded in lowering unemployment, but did nothing substantial in the long or short run to save the economy- World War 2 and the paying jobs it created was the real lifeline there.<br>  <br>  He's basically following the liberal tactic of throwing money at the problem rather than thinking it through and using a method that actually works. Picking advisors that are qualified in their position rather than just to see how many political stunts he can pull off would be a much better alternative and a compass toward the right direction. He also needs to figure out that people aren't going to like him because he's part black. He is just as vulnerable to a sudden disapproval as Bush, Clinton and any other president was.<br>  <br>  The "plan," if you can call it that, is to basically give money to the auto industry, which has already failed in its attempts to use past stimulus packages to accomplish anything. Additionally, the debt created by this mess will take an estimate of over 50-60 years to pay off. Of course, if you want to know where the money that isn't going to Chrysler, GM, etc, then ask Nancy Pelosi- not that she'll tell anybody anything truthful that doesn't benefit herself.|`|0yuxnSocaa	Obamas stimulus plan is an effort to try and change our failed economy.

There last week I had one and I stood up on the bed and ran off the end of it injuring my legs on the TV stand which made it worse coz I thought I had broken my legs (that I can remember) then the next thing I know I'm sitting up in bed still having a panic attack. I didn't know how I got back into bed I knew I was on the other side of the room and that's all I remember really but it went on for like 20 minutes. It's a horrible experience and for people who don't experience them (like my parents and partner) it's not easy for them to understand but the only thing I can put it down to is stress because they are not a regular occurrence. And usually I don't remember what it was that caused them (i.e. being chased or monsters or whatever) but it is so real like it's there it's really there and I know it is. Another time I was at work away from home, only moved into a house with people and I was starting a job long story short I rang my ma at 3 in the morning convinced there was something in or around the room and I ended up staying up the rest of the night sitting on the floor.

t1OSx5VOaa	Try looking up 'framing' - it's about the way that a question is framed.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  <br>  "You have a 10% chance of dying, if you have this operation" <br>  vs<br>  "90% of people survive this operation".<br>  <br>  Lots of the work one this was done by Kahneman and Tversky.<br>  <br>  Here's another  example;:<br>  <br>  A: You are about to buy a jacket for $125 and a calculator for $15. The calculator salesman informs you that a store 20 minutes away offers the same calculator for $10. Would you make the trip to the other store?<br>  B: You are about to buy a jacket for $15 and a calculator for $125. The calculator salesman informs you that a store 20 minutes away offers the same calculator for $120. Would you make the trip to the other store?<br>  <br>  It's the same question - will you drive 20 mins to save $5.  But (in studies) most people said yes to A, and most people said no to B.<br>  <br>  Another similar thing is the Wason selection task. This is a strange task, because if you ask the question in some ways, it's really hard.  But if you ask in other ways, it's really easy.

DyviGDAwaa	You need to learn how to be on your own. Try not jumping into another relationship until you've learned how to be alone and be comfortable with yourself. It's hard, very hard. But you have to be persistant because you don't want to make the same mistake again. By sometimes codependancy takes alot more work than you can do on your own. I would suggest maybe seeing a therapist who is specialized in helping people with these types of issues. Also, look up codependancy online. There is so much information on it. <br>  <br>  But my best advice would be to learn to make yourself happy before you try to make someone else happy. you come first!|`|0KtFtnZVaa	Go to therapy. And do not date anyone until you feel comfortable with the things you have learned.<br>  <br>  Because you have been in a co dependant relationship you will be more likely to "choose" the same type of person as you were in a relationship with not because you want it but because it is familiar.<br>  <br>  I know this because my mother was in that type of relationship and now I am as well. It isn't healthy but if you have no basis of comparison you will tend to gravitate towards the same.|`|2EobcGqqaa	I totally agree with the first person.  You definitely need to work on being alone and enjoying it.  Most people who are codependent have an identity crisis.  Meaning they don't really know who they are and they rely on others to make them happy. Discover yourself and what you like.  I used to be codependent.  When I finally got out of the codependent relationship I was in, I didn't even know who I was. I realized I became this way because of the way I was raised.  I reacted to relationships just like my mom did.  Also there are support groups that help with codependency.  I suggest joining one of them or seeing a therapist.|`|cvukfE8Gaa	I would start with  some support groups in your area that you can join. If that fails then I would see a therapist.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	There are several support groups out there. One is called coda and the other is al-anon. Both will give you the skills and tools you need to not live as a caretaker the rest of your life. The author Melody Beattie has written many books on this subject of codependency, all of which are easy reading and excellent books. They have been a big help in my life and I have been working this program for over 15 years. It's really an eye opener and can be lots of fun as well. I wish you all the best and remember we do have to work at this, without doing so there is no help, no recovery and no happy and contented life.|`|2PDBxlYDaa	I agree with the others. Don't put all your happiness into the basket of a relationship. It sounds cheesy but its true. What are some things that you want to do but haven't been able to? Do you want to work with children, learn a language, whatever passions you have try and follow them. A man should be the icing on the cake and not your entire life.
IaWlzcNsaa	Nature helps with such things.  Take a hike with someone or by yourself (personally I find the company nice).  I also use herbs or essences of herbs.  Chamomile Tea or Green Tea is good. Beat on a drum.  Jump rope.  Swing on a swing.  Go dancing!! Take your shoes off and walk barefoot!  Listen to music on a deep level (classical music, good "real" jazz, native american, hammered dulcimer... some new age or electronic... no junk!) <br>  <br>  There are really a lot of things you can do, you just have to be open to things and do not limit yourself by convention.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	God!

Then there are companies like Ceberus that buy companies steal their assets and lay off the employees and move on.

Will they do the same to the automaker?  time will tell.|`|nM2k6geEaa	God only says to give 10% not all of your wealth.

God is never out done in generosity<br>  Love of God and love of neighbor is the beginning of the Eternal happiness Jesus promised<br>  If you have been giving free transportation, its okay to ask for gas money, if you have been serving in the kitchen food line, its okay to  have a meal too.  Get a part time job,  if your volunteering becomes limited,  prayers and hard work solves many problems.|`|FKqtAhjraa	Do what you can.  I have to make a living but when I can do something for someone I do.  I cannot put my family in risk for it but I can still do a lot of things.  My husband always says;"it will come back to you" every time I hesitate.  And I must admit I have been very blessed at times when I needed it the most. And whatever job I had, I did it extra well, took that extra minute when I could.  I tried to be extra caring to patients or customers depending on the job I had at the time.  It made the day go faster and better for me.  I felt better.  I built a good reputation.  My guess is that you are not taking care of yourself, you feel deprived and that leads to resentment.  You have to be good to yourselves too.   You have to know where to draw the line, how to say no.  Once you treat yourself as well as you treat others you'll have it. Good Luck!|`|qGh1HhPwaa	All of the above, and its hard to change. Do it slowly, but do it.<br>  You can still be nice people|`|RE6BBaeSaa	Altruism is good. That is actually what makes the world go ' round, not money.|`|nkTKIXcBaa	I have the same problem, to an extent, but more that I'm overly generous with my time (i.e, volunteering for everything, saying yes to virtually any "favor" anyone asks of me) rather than my possessions. What's helped me is to make a list of things that I need to do, and use that as justification to myself for not helping when I can't. <br>  Maybe you can try making a list of things you need the money for?<br>  I wouldn't blame this on low self-esteem or bad habits, because I've always been more cocky than self-deprecating and I'd say that being generous is a good habit. More likely, you and your husband both just like seeing people be grateful to you and that nice fuzzy feeling you get when you help someone :)|`|4Rh1qQAoaa	Giving is good!

When you need money we need to remember that they need it more.|`|Z02QN9Vfaa	I have a coworker who quite often does for others instead of watching out for her own needs. She volunteers numerous hours to different causes and organizations, leaving less than enough time to concentrate on the work she gets paid for. For her, partly its that she really wants to make the world a better place, has a hard time saying no when someone asks for help, and partly that she takes on so many roles so she can feel better about herself. Her self esteem is quite low, despite the fact she is a bright, lovely woman with an MBA, her own business, and a brilliant mind. Her interpersonal relationships can be dysfunctional, and she lives at home with her parents at age 39. For her, it probably is 70% being a generous, good person, and about 30%, needing validation of being appreciated or needed. <br>  <br>  I used to wear myself out physically, mentally, emotionally and give just about every cent I had to charity work and additional things in my 20s and 30s. When I became too ill to do all the charity work, I realized what was really most important in life (to me)...a good homelife, moderate pace, more time with my husband and family and friends, and now I choose one charity that we support with time and money,and I have cut out all the rest of the councils and agencies and groups and non-profits. Focusing my energies on one key project a year helps us raise more money for the charity, and it gives me more of a life. Its all about balance.<br>  <br>  When you are needing to cut back, the first thing is to prioritize the differnet ways you are spending your time and money in these causes. Which ones do you feel strongest about? Which ones are most draining for you? No one has to take on the whole world. If each of us does one charitable act, things would be covered. <br>  <br>  You don't have to stop caring. You can still be loving, charitable people, but you can say no to joining more groups, or ask others to take on some of your responsibilities. You are good people, and you deserve to enjoy your lives too. You don't have to save the world. Find a couple days a month that you will deal with or handle charitabe acts. Then keep the rest of your schedule to yourself.

The best thing you can do is get to an emotional place where you've made peace with the things you've done and move on. This is how addiction starts. It's escapism. <br>  <br>  Drinking your problems away is a temporary and easy fix, but it also leads to...more and heavier drinking and possibly drugs. You need to confront the things you've done, figure out a way that you can still wake up and look at yourself in the mirror without feeling tremendous guilt, and deal with your issues. If it's because you don't feel like the things you've done paint a picture of who you feel you are, then realize that everyone makes mistakes, everyone does things that are out of character. We learn from the things that we feel guilty about and we become better people. Everyone does it, it's part of growing up.|`|f0403e22633ac756d1800f187e5b9ab1aa	Drinking allows you to escape from the troubles of the world that we all endure.  The alcohol is comforting to our mind and body making us feel relaxed and forget the bad times for a couple of hours.  It's alright to drink ... in order to unwind and have a good time just don't drink in excess to where you are so drunk you are acting like a fool.  As to other alternatives to feeling carefree without consuming alcohol perhaps try going to a movie or discuss things that are bothering you with someone whom you can trust to confide that sort of information to.  Alcohol is great when consumed sparingly and if you are having troubles with on-going problems it might not be such a good thing, as alcohol can impair your judgment. You should not let it be your first choice, as an escape route.|`|7rUtpsRBaa	Well if your mistakes haunt you night and day unfortunately there is no way to be carefree and relaxed besides doing some sort of drug. The only way to live carefree is overcome your mistakes. I cant say how because i don't not know what your mistakes are but maybe work them out if it/they have to do with people or just accept the fact that no one in life is perfect so you have to move on and just continue to live in the moment.|`|YFX2R2ucaa	the worst think you can do is start drinking, before youll notice youll be drinking regularly. alcohol will take over your life! dont let that happen!|`|6BWNvGi2aa	Physiologically, your neurological (brain) track is feeling guilt. As endorphins kick in, your brain looks for one outcome: anything to help stall and heal the reaction. When your body receives the message, you want to do some high risk activity. Symptoms include chest pressure, fatigue, and headache. I would talk to a counselor, or confess to your self. This will relive the stress on your brain, creating a stronger thinking track, awareness, and leading a happier life. Good luck! :)|`|CuLkglc8aa	ask a professional.<br>  <br>  Greetings!|`|IYF4xSTdaa	because this is what alcohol does to you...makes you forget for a while<br>  and as soon as you remembers,you take another drink again..it is easy to take a drink and forget for a while..but in the long run you are only hurting yourself...cause when you done drinking and you get sober you still have all the problems...<br>  try thinking before you do something,stop making so many mistakes..<br>  try dealing with and fixing some of your mistakes...and the drink will be less..|`|zakIuo91aa	Tallk to a girlfriend.<br>  She'll know what to do.
4676ab82fdec587e35a8084755696854aa	If you avoid going because of the anxiety, you are only reinforcing your fear. You aren't "crazy". Separation anxiety is a specific phobia, and you are not the only one to experience this. The only /proven/ way to treat a phobia is to face it. Avoiding the situation is what you will WANT to do, and avoidance will only make your anxiety worse in the long run. Concentrate on your thought processes. Are you thinking things that are illogical and irrational? If so, this is something you could work on. Tell yourself things will be alright, think positive. You said you wouldn't be able to just leave and come home, and that's a source of anxiety, but you can call home at least, can't you? Obviously it's up to you, it would be out of your comfort zone, I guess it depends on how motivated you are to overcome this, but there is no way to overcome your fear by avoiding it. <br>  <br>  Good luck. :) I'm sure you'll do fine either way.|`|xNtu1j3xaa	hey :D, the first step is always realizing your fear! and it's great that you know your own fear :]<br>  If you cant force your mind to overcome this fear thats no problem just take it one step at a time!  Why dont you start off with bringing little items that can remind you of your mom and home (objects that remind but not make you miss).  If that doesn't work and will only make you miss your home and mom, then you should bring a webcam :D and webcam with your mom :D.  If that doesn't work then i suggest you think of an alternative :[ or just rethink going on this trip ;x.<br>  <br>  best of luck to you D: <br>  ~keep on smiling :]

It happens way too often.  Some women just don't have the maternal instincts that other's do.  Some have a psychological disorder like schizophrenia.  Other's suffer delusional forms of depression.  Some just don't give a crap about anybody but themselves and have no problems doing away with anyone or anything that gets in their way.|`|ciXSjbCiaa	Its an unthinkable act to normal healthy people. In her case, I think its a combination of things with influences both from genetics and also environment. <br>  <br>  1. She's always gotten away with lies. She lies, lies, lies, makes things up that are clearly incorrect and I think to a certain extent even convinces herself that they are true. She is pathological liar. People like that don't "live" in the real world. They live in a world that they create for themselves; therefore, everything and anything is justifiable. Have you watched any of her video conferences or seen her in court - her facial expression is denial, denial, denial and all her lies point to this. She isn't facing the facts and has learned to get what she wants, ruthlessly, by recreating a new truth in her mind. <br>  <br>  2. Combine 1 with the fact that she was irresponsible and selfish and didn't want to be a mom. She didn't want to put in the time, the effort, the love and endure the stress of being a mommy. This combination with traits in the first part are a really bad combination. She wants to get out of a situation, can think of unthinkable horrible acts as an option only because she can justify it in her mind with a bunch of lies. <br>  <br>  Its a really sad story and it is obvious that casey anthony has many underlying psych abnormalities (to say the least). Its just unfortunate that this poor little girl had to suffer:(

For example:<br>  <br>  Original sentence was: Tenacious, revolutionary and outspoken are all words that characterized the late Louis Leakey.<br>  <br>  Your sentence could be: Lewis Leakey, described as "tenacious, revolutionary and outspoken," shaped the discipline of anthropology (Hillenbrand, 2008).
jDOebxOSaa	I agree with you that our world makes such a big deal about romance an ultimately, marriage. But I also believe love is innate, essential at some point in one's life.  But, if you are happier single, and don't want to bother with satisfying another person, all the power to you. Love can be so powerful, so wonderful, but it can also be very risky, and limiting.<br>  You are not missing out on what life is all about. Life may be about Love to one person, while it is about something else to another individual. I think life is about being curious, asking questions.. seems like you are on the right track. It is vital to ask questions, seek answers.. we are only human. we aren't suppose to know what its all about.|`|UId4IF9Oaa	Amor Vincit Omnia|`|2YdpqmQ7aa	Yeah, get out and be social.

Qk3b5qMxaa	If you're not ready for a relationship, don't push yourself. I know a lot people in their early years of adulthood, who have a bunch of fake, temporary relatioships that are a veritable waste of time. You seem like the type of person who is comitted and genuine. And, real, serious relationships do require a lot of time and effort. They are not just about opening up, since you have to use both your heart and your mind to evaluate a potential partner.<br>  <br>    Also, you seem to have this desperate need to communicate with another human being.  If your rush into relationships before you satisfy your needs for love, you are more likely to enter into a chain of dysfunctional relatioships.  You should take some time to cultivate your interests and figure out who your are. You are young and you do not need a physical relationship to make you feel worthy of acceptance. Try to make friends with people who share your interests, expand your friendship circle, go out more, and I'm sure you'll meet a lot of interesting people. By improving your social skills, you will gain the resiliancy, confidence, and self-respect to be able to enter into a relationship that empowers you.|`|e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	I don't think it is necessary, as in absolutely essential to live. But it is nice to know that someone cares about you.<br>  <br>  Don't think love has to come from the opposite gender by way of a romantic relationship. Healthy relationships need trust, understanding, communication and hard work, which is often too much for a man. Love may also come from a family member.<br>  <br>  Love is more necessary than romance is, but not one of the basic needs for survival.|`|f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	Everything you said I was once!

Well I found love, without trying, married and just had my third child!!

And now I do feel love is necessary!|`|gYbe3BNeaa	You're only 21, don't worry about it.|`|AA11313798	If you've never experienced it, then no, you're not missing anything. You only miss something you've once had. For those who have experienced love.. and to not being in a relationship.. yeah it can be a very big thing to miss.<br>  <br>  And yes you're right, society blows up "love and relationship" into such a big thing. <br>  <br>  If you don't have feelings for anyone, then you just don't. And that's perfectly normal. I agree with you, some people are too obsessive with relationships.. its almost OCD. lol<br>  <br>  some people have been in so many, relationship is like a daily routine to them and love has lost its meaning.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the point is, love is a great feeling. it doesn't have to be sexual or romantic either, family love feels nice. but to be in a relationship, and know that you're sharing your life with someone, and feeling their passion and comfort, is truely a "great" feeling. it really is one of those great feelings. lol but you won't know what it feels like unless you've been in it. <br>  <br>  You're not missing out unless you've actually found the right one. Why get into relationships if you don't feel the spark? Then you'd be wasting your time and getting feelings involved and hurt for no reason.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about what society tells you, just worry about what your heart and brain tells you.<br>  <br>  But from my experienced, if it helps, yes I am truely in love with my girlfriend and it's the best thing to know. a real relationship is stable, and stability means predictability, which means comfort.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Yes.

mCAWxobNaa	If it's in the context of an intimate encounter, I would think the man is awkwardly trying to say that he likes your skin and is complimenting you on your appearance.  Chances are that he's either misusing the word or doesn't really know what "fragile" means.  It's an odd term to use (I certainly would never use it when speaking to a woman, especially in an intimate setting.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't get too caught up thinking about it; it sounds more like the guy just didn't know what to say and something fairly silly came out of his mouth.  Usually this happens to me when I'm really enchanted with a girl where I'll say something really awkward and then I'll feel like an idiot later and hope that she doesn't dwell on it too.|`|zXPGm2fraa	If it's a man touching your skin and he's calling you fragile? He must think it's some kind of compliment... remember in grade school when the boys were told not to hit the girls because girls are "more fragile"?  I think some of them take it literally like we're made of glass.|`|AA11313798	a fragile person is someone that breaks easy. i doubt it has to do with skin. because you added fragile next to soft.<br>  <br>  some people handle stress better and hardly go into crisis. for those that are the opposite, they're considered fragile.<br>  <br>  fragile is a good word to use for that. i'd rather keep soft for tactile descriptions.. <br>  <br>  <br>  so i guess in other words.. those women.. are being referred to as those who FREAK OUT ALL THE TIME.. lol..or are always a mess|`|gYbe3BNeaa	A nervous wreck.
sX9Ilrpxaa	I think this is pretty unlikely.  When you read something like this, you have to think about who wrote it what their possibly biases might be.  Also, it is important to seek parsimonious explanations for observed phenomenon.  For example, visions of the "world of ancestral beings" could be induced by trance, fasting, or hallucinogens. We have a long history of observing these things, where alien sightings are pretty much unverified.  You aren't going to find anything about them except on the very periphery of science.  Then again, there can always be paradigm shifts ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_sh...</a> ).  I would never rule anything out completely, but I don't think aliens are currently the best explanation.|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	Maybe.|`|BMxNOJ39aa	No. <br>  <br>  Two main points. Let the Empire State Building represent the age of the earth. On that scale the entire existence of the human race would be represented by a book on top the TV tower. Odd are far in favor of any aliens finding no life on the planet and certainly no humans at all. <br>  <br>  Second point. Why does one have to go back to 1945? Are we to believe that there's been NO other investigations? More likely it's a claim but with no evidence.|`|1760OdxNaa	Do a lot more reading about shamanism please!

By this rationale, intelligence (as understanding) is arguably different from being "smart" (able to adapt to one's environment).<br>  <br>  I personally interchange the words.  We use terms like "street smart" and "book smart" which are usually instilled in a person based on their experiences.  Intelligence seems to mean the ability to understand.|`|kiNBVPdMaa	I agree with the Canadian (there's a first !!)<br>  <br>  I think of inteliigence in a more acedemic/therotical sense... whereas as smart ...well kind of includes an element of pracitical application and dare I say it ... cunning ?<br>  <br>  We tend to talk about people being a 'smart cookie',  'smart operator' or having 'street smarts'.

chlGzFQlaa	I agree, in addition, mass media also indirectly instills stereotypes against certain psychological types and ethnicities i.e. loners and asians. They try to replace our innate thought process by providing stereotypical responses to certain thoughts of ours and thus if mass media doesn't simply make society's progress static, it in fact reverses progress. We're on the way to the Unabomber's Anarcho-Primal world, mass media's excessiveness just made it shoot itself in the foot. Anarchy all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Mass Media at its worst simply inhibits analytical thought by telling us what to think. The youth of the nation is the first generation of this kind. We have been raised by our televisions and video games and here we are, the middle children with no cause or purpose, our great war is a spiritual one, an incessant search to find meaning in either what is or what is not there. Hopefully, we're all slowly realizing this, and we're getting very, very pissed off. <br>  <br>  Yeah I used some lines from Chuck Palanhuik's novel Fight Club in the second paragraph.|`|d2fVJ4Ouaa	I believe it does.<br>  All media are constructions. They are created.<br>  Because they are created, they also imply an idealistic view on reality.<br>  <br>  I guess it works in the simplest sense, having consumers purchase products because maybe it will make them more attractive or more popular.<br>  <br>  But from a sociological view, it's severely damaging society.|`|AA11346438	NO! people are smart enough and strong enough to think for themselves.<br>  <br>  we can't blame the media for everything. since human beings work in the media, then criticizing them would be quite myopic too, right?|`|Het9lG90aa	you used a lot of big words<br>  <br>  way over my head

9EVcTnUWaa	To get a PH, D. In psychology would require a Bachelor in liberal arts or psychology. Than you would need either a master degree in psychology  and than you would have to work on your PH.D. It will take about 3 to 5 years after college and than you have to do a residency.  And I'm sorry but you don't automatically get a scholarship when you turn 18. I have three daughter's and several nieces and nephews some got partial scholarships some got none. There are a lot of things that go into getting scholarships including your parents income and your grades.  There are places on the web where you can apply for scholarships but a lot of other people will be applying also.  I think that your mother means Grants which are given by the goverment for college but they don't always cover the full cost.  When my 30 year old daughter went to school for her under graduate degree she got goverment grants and they didn't cover everything and she went to a state school were the tuition was about 4000 a year. Now that she's working on her master's degree she's had to take out a student loan( which means that she'll have to pay it back) Grants and scholarship you don't have to pay them back.

You have to make your own (very own) contribution to a psychology. You have to come up with your own theory or correct and modify somebody else's. Of course, you will have to sign up in a university for a Ph.D program, but the university will only grant you your doctorate. Just keep learning, don't stop learning. You have to be an autodidact, a free and guided creative thinker. And last but not the least you will have to work your a*s off. No greatness comes easy.

However at this point it is all a choice: do you want to remain friends or do younwant to be officially boy/girl friend? If you ask her and she get's an unpleasant shock from it, then you will most likely loosen your relationship especially if she rejects. If she accepts and the two of you become boy/girl friend you need to realize that your responsibilities have doubled and your dedication to the girl needs to double if you are trully sensere. People who are not sensere end up breaking up soonernor later as soon as they are fed up with their role and the condned-from-the-beginning couple ends up breaking up. After you break up your friendship will most likly never recover to the same passion again. That is why you always need to keep this in mind: girl friends are great, but girls who are friends are better and a half. It is easy to lose a girlfriend, please take my word for it, but friends last forever.<br>  I am 17. I just became a boyfriend only a few months back and did it hesitantly because my girl was a close friend before this. Now we are so much closer and to make sure we remain close both our roles increased in eachother's lives. It's more work than being a friend beleive it or not but the feeling of this new special bond between us is incredible and it only intencifies our honest love for eachother.<br>  I have no idea whatnO just wrote because my train of thought just followed many tangled tracks LOL. I am not sure if I even helped out becuase I got so distracted, but I hope you can get something out of this.<br>  Good luck, it's all up to you how your histoy will go. I hopenwhateger the outcome may be though makes you happy and without regrets. Good luck man, I feel your situation|`|APV6EHXeaa	Do you like her? if you answer yes. Don't be too friendly or too nice! Hold her hand more often and make more eye contact with her. Make a move, don't be scare but be confidence. Hug her like you haven't seen her in a long time. Be creative and take her on a date. Don't become a shopping friend. Hope this help
ToILKl6waa	If after a good night, you talked to her about the friendship sprouting into something more, I do think that it's an exceptional start. And looking at her response, I think she wants you to take on the responsibility of making things intimate.

The relationship is sure to work out. <br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|XbxZR2nGaa	GOOD LUCK

However it is become a habit and is a bad one to break.  The easiest way to do so is to actually get off your bum if only for a minute or two and make a list.  A list of all of your unfinished business and get to work by accomplishing them and then crossing them off one by one.  Give yourself a realistic number of goals to complete per day, but no time frame in finishing the entirety.  Even give yourself rewards as you see fit.  If you screw up which you will, don't beat yourself up over it, just get back on the horse so to speak and move forward.  This immature behavior needs to stop somewhere.

It might be ADD<br>  <br>  Maybe seeing a mental health professional would be a good idea.<br>  <br>  Do you just resist whenever someone tries to push you in a certain direction?

If this one is why you never do anything, well...<br>  <br>  it's a weird answer but it just might help you.<br>  <br>  If you've heard of Alcoholics Anonymous and the 12 step program, you might be aware that there's an Overeaters Anonymous and a Workaholics anonymous.<br>  <br>  Here's where I'm going with this: if an anorexic person wants help, and thinks the 12 steps is right for them, they go to Overeaters Anonymous because they have a problem with the process of eating. In the same way, Workaholics Anonymous believes that there's such a thing as "work anorexia," the opposite of being a workaholic the same way that an anorexic is the opposite of someone who is addicted to overeating. The effect is opposite but they believe that it is the same problem.<br>  <br>  If you think that sounds like you, then maybe you should look into WA or some other program for workaholics. You may find what you need there.<br>  <br>  edit: it might just be a fancy word for lazy like the other answers are saying, but it doesn't matter what the label is: it matters that you find a solution that works.

Q9NHnC9Vaa	Hello Brianna n bremmy, <br>  <br>  Seeing cockroaches in your dream means your need for renewal, rejuvenation and self-cleansing of your psychological, emotional, or spiritual being. You need to reevaluate major aspects of your life.<br>  <br>  Seeing your sister differently, is warning you to stay away from the friends who are not sincere. Just don't trust on everyone. Otherwise, some of your friends can harm your reputation or put you in depression.<br>  <br>  Your dream is pointing towards forgiveness and letting go. Just don't take things too seriously which ends putting you in depression.<br>  <br>  Nothing would go wrong as long as you take precaution in everything. Just don't trust everyone.
5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	Ok, I almost didn't answer this because nobody will believe me anyway, but here goes: there's one of two things going on: either you experienced some sort of psychological break, or you were in fact dealing with something spiritual. Before you decide that it's spiritual, you need to go see a therapist and see if they can help you figure out the source of the problem from a psychological standpoint.  Do you have any history of mental disorders in your family? Have you been under stress lately? Finally, are you sure that you weren't in some sort of sleep induced state? <br>  <br>  I've experienced some things that were of a spiritual nature, and you can e-mail me if you want to know more about it. There is some possibility that you're dealing with a spirit, but I would eliminate other possibilities first. Believing that it's a spirit when it isn't could add to a preexisting psychological problem. <br>  <br>  Or, all of this could be some form of sleepwalking. E-mail me if you still think it's spiritual.|`|d5be3ea2f1c4eca02ee532b102a80535aa	Are you saved? Do you believe in the blood that Jesus Christ shed for you on Calvary?

I'm not a religious person, but I think its definitely possible especially having had many supernatural experiences of my own. I'd do some research on it and other things as well. Its normal to sometimes wake up in the middle night and not be able to move your body, but not having control of your own actions is abnormal. I've heard that people are more susceptible to possession if they are  constanly thinking negative thoughts, depressed, and have a lack of will/energy. Also, its difficult for a healthy person to becom possessed unless they somehow invited the entity--conscious or unconscious of the consequences. An example would be when people play around with ouiji boards without taking it seriously, or search out ghsts etc. Someone inexperienced will attract negative beings before postive ones because the negative beings are looking for that vulnerability. <br>  <br>  I would reccomend telling your family/doctor and considering an exorcism. You don't have to be religious to recieve one b/c in essence it is the positive force of the universe battling the negative forces. Also, I've read that entities that possess can be "ex-human souls" or non-human souls---something akin to the traditional view of a demon. <br>  <br>  I'm interested in your case, and hope you figure out what's wrong and get better.

It makes sense to me that larger arms were because that was their primary weapon like chimps and gorillas even though both will deliver a bite.  Taking shelter at night in a tree certainly makes sense but I doubt the arm length is a hold over.  The arm probably got smaller as they used them differently to hold clubs and other weapons.  Characteristics such as arm length could change very quickly because it is a simple evolutionary change. It is a great question but i never heard of any specific answers to that. Because of the erectus cohabiting with habilis, I suspect they are multiple lineages and some habilis are probably less technological, thus bigger arms.|`|ZuPub3jaaa	I believe the answer is that they were still spending time in trees, almost definitely to sleep. I believe the answer is in the ecology, the terrain was in transition from forest to savanna it's believed that bipedality may have come from the need to cross grass lands in search for foresr patches with more food resources.
AA11773731	I lost my mom to cancer April 2008. She was my entire world and I watched her slowly die from the disease. You never really get over the death of people we love. The pain may lessen over the years but it will never go away. Some days are better than others, like when you think of them and smile then there are those days when you see their picture and it feels like losing them all over again. The way I deal with it is that I talk about her. I let people know what a great mom she was and how thankful I am to have her in my life.
951tTsRQaa	Sometimes dreams are a way for the mind to play out a situation and search for possible courses of action in case the situation arises in reality.  It's a way for you to mentally prepare to act.  Dreaming about a frightening situation may just be preparing you mentally for that situation.|`|0hPOWNEOaa	Many people try to differentiate a nightmare from a dream, but they are the same thing. A nightmare is just a dream that you personally find frightening or displeasing. As far as why people dream, nobody knows for certain.

QOt9aTdXaa	You feel a real connection to Andy. The bag he gave you is simply you learning from him or gaining Inspiration from him. Nothing more than that.  Good luck I'll be praying for you.|`|DKiftd4Naa	A lot of dreams should be taken literally- sorta. Your subconscious may be telling you that you're going through a traumatic time, and you're accepting it. Maybe its telling you that you need to ask for help or you need someone to comfort or take care of you.
TkUL4OINaa	He gets jealous easily, which means he really likes and cares for you. It's not like the cousins think you're their cousins' gf means that they not gonna touch you. <br>  Nowadays anything can happen.

But all he cares for is that you get taken away from him.|`|aI1gl4K3aa	maybe he thinks his cousins might like you, maybe he thinks you will like them better, maybe he's afraid they will say something embaressing. men are weird but i'd bet its one of those.
AA12360662	Owl not doing hoot or screech and you found it beautiful may reflect something unusual in life that you are expecting.<br>  <br>  You may be looking for peaceful situation and that unusual thing you are looking for basically reflect how you want others to notice.  This owl is basically a reflection of some attention seeking and this attention seeking basically comes from your own personal preference and you want others to share your interest in some aspect of your life too.|`|8d8ejHPfaa	Well, you didn't really offer any details to speak of, but what you did post sounds spiritual.  The one word associated with owls above all is "wisdom", the owl is associated with Athena, the Goddess of wisdom.  The owl, with it's penetrating eyes, is known for ruling the night, it is able to penetrate mystery (the darkness) with insight. Perhaps you were in communication with your own higher wisdom :)|`|xb3RjkV2aa	The owl is a symbol of wisdom, seriousness and thoughtfulness. Dreaming of an owl in the dream means that your judgement of a personal situation or a person was correct. It also could mean that some vague matter became much clearer. Seeing an owl in the dream may also mean that you should take good advice from others. Hearing an owl screeching denotes bad luck, frustration, grief or sadness. Catching an owl or seeing an owl in the cage means that you should be careful of weird people and bad company.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	It means you are in the middle of significant good fortune and you should visit a wildlife sanctuary, a zoo or go camping. You have been visited by a protective spirit and you should let your artistic inner self paint the picture you dreamed of.|`|QM7cAE4vaa	An owl that hoots at you would be a forewarning, but otherwise it symbols wisdom, insight and virtue.  Wise old owl..|`|n9vByQgdaa	It means you have cancer.|`|owD2d9xQaa	To see an owl in your dream, symbolizes wisdom, insight and virtue. The owl is also synonymous with death and darkness.It is another symbol for the unconscious. It usually represents wisdom and virtue, and your unconscious may be giving you important massages, so pay attention to the other details in the dream|`|ICaqUu73aa	i think it is an omen of good fortune. either that or just a random dream.<br>  try looking for a physicic website where you can try to find out what a silent owl means
bq6ptwACaa	i think its because like things are going bad (like economy blah blah) and so people sort of think that the hope or thought of anything good happening is unrealistic. i think we would rather be pleasantly surprised, than disapointed.|`|fwIe1sQwaa	When the good old 90s ended :P|`|24d92bd0241aeea71cccfaf017c6c707aa	cheer up the worst is yet to come :)<br>  <br>  I think people just want hard hitting facts these days rather than a view that it's not as bad as they think.
c6eae266bb501e0a315d4b3e606f9c99aa	Psychologists who have their own private practice can certainly make that much.  If you have a private practice, there are start-up costs, so you aren't going to make that much right away, but it is certainly possible after a number of years.  Psychologists working in hospitals, clinics, etc, will make quite a bit less, more like the 50-75,000 range.|`|urxsjDMKaa	i know a psychologist can make a good amout but a pshychiatrist can make more money. but you have to go to school alot longer.|`|d2fVJ4Ouaa	In regards to the first answer, a psychologist is an actual DOCTOR. this means he or she attended med school and specialized afterwards, which is a completely different educational path. (Doctors obviously make heaps)<br>  A psychologist either has a Masters or a PhD.

2GNFQPdmaa	What exactly do you mean by "owe?" The government hasn't taken loans from foreign governments. <br>  <br>  If you mean trade balance, then basically it means they are holding a lot of US dollars, and if they wanted to they could say "sell us something for these dollars or we will decide they're worthless." That would make the value of the dollar crash. They couldn't come and take stuff, they could just stop trading with us and cause a currency meltdown.<br>  <br>  If you mean that they hold treasury bills, that is actually government debt. If they want to call that debt due, they would get cash for it, and we're back at the previous paragraph. Their choices are:<br>  <br>  To spend the dollars they hold on American goods, or to sell those dollars at a discount to some other person or country.|`|GR8jsGgLaa	America's debt is secured by the faith people place in the US Government to repay its obligations.  Debt = Faith. Nothing tangible.|`|AA10700486	Nothing, and the gold being uselessly stored in Fort Knox certainly has nothing to do with the national debt. <br>  <br>  Actually it sounds like you may be confusing the debt with our ongoing trade deficits, because neither Canada nor Mexico entities hold any significant amount of U.S. debt last I checked. And that is an entirely separate issue. <br>  <br>  But as to the debt, no it cannot be "called in" by the creditors. It exists in the form of U.S. Treasury Bonds that the government sells to the public at auction (somewhat like US Savings bonds, but normal Treasuries can be bought and sold on public exchanges). Treasury bonds have fixed maturities ... for example, you could buy a 10-year bond next time they are sold at auction. That means that in 10 years the government will redeem the face value of the bond (and pay you regular interest in the mean time). <br>  <br>  Most of these bonds are actually bought by American businesses, banks, and individuals (meaning we owe most of the debt to ourselves), but foreigners are free to buy them too.<br>  <br>  When we say "China" owns some of our debt, that means that people, or businesses, or banks, or government agencies of China have chosen to buy some of those Treasury Bonds that are available. They are then free to sell them on the bond markets, but they cannot demand anything from the US government beyond the stated interest and scheduled redemption.|`|7HdgMaOnaa	We secure it by having gold in fort Knox it's currently at 97% which means the gold we have can pay for 97% of our debt but each time the government prints more money it goes down a certain percent

You have to gather your courage and deal with the issues to the best of your ability. I know things are difficult and it may seem unbearable at times, but you are only getting stronger inside by passing through so much hardship. Write both your parents a letter about how you're feeling and if they choose to not take it to heart, that's their own dilemma. Go to your room and drain everything out with music.

32Uyhmggaa	Of course.<br>  New business spurs innovation and gives consumers more choices. These are the cornerstones of a healthy economy. Some of the best economies in the world (e.g. Hong Kong) are countries with no government with no restrictions and little business taxes.<br>  Without new business, it's hard for society to change in any meaningful way.
2GNFQPdmaa	Entrepreneurship and small businesses are an important part of the American economy, and part of the reason why unemployment is historically lower here than in western Europe, where entrepreneurs aren't always thought of as highly. That being said, now might not be the best time to start a small business, I see a lot of them closing. <br>  <br>  To start a business you have to be able to sell something, and right now people aren't buying.
2GNFQPdmaa	That would cause massive, massive unemployment. It would be catastrophic.

And work was evenly distributed between people.  Then people would end up with a lot of leisure time.  They would need to work 15 to 20 hours a week only.<br>  <br>  But in practice that's not how things work.  <br>  <br>  Many people have a lot of debts to pay off.  Which means that they have to be as frugal as they can be and still work their butts off.<br>  <br>  And those who don't have any debts to repay still need to work at full-time 40-hour a week jobs.  Because if they don't, then someone else will take their job.  And they would end up either completely unemployed.

Strictly speaking we don't NEED anything beyond crude stone-age level shelter, clothing and food.  So the answer to your question is we'd revert all the way back to stone age lifestyles and become an impoverished neolithic society like our ancestors 7,000 years ago. <br>  <br>  We'd all have "jobs" because we'd all have to be working constantly -- planting, hunting, gathering, sharpening our stone arrowheads, etc -- just to survive.<br>  <br>  Anything beyond that is an unneeded luxury.|`|7HdgMaOnaa	Don't listen to the tool above me

Not being influenced by the people around you. Knowing what you believe and standing up for it . Standing up for what you think is right. Being able to express yourself freely without the thought of others worrying - but being compassionate at the same time.

And self worth - appreciating the very things youve done for other people and respecting your own decisions and believe in them.|`|Lnw6ZYMoaa	You don't care if someone is judging you.

ekEj2Mbiaa	I've cut myself in the past, don't do it. You need to stop, it doesn't solve a thing.  And I'm a huge fan of MCR as well, and knowing that they were against cutting yourself was huge motivation for me to stop. They also taught me a lot. Remember, you'll always have MCR to help you in some sort of way :)    If you ever need to talk to someone, anyone. Feel free to email me anytime! I've dealt with depression, and I'm still struggling with it. I suffer from bipolar disorder, and I cope with it by talking about it with my boyfriend and my only friend.  So I suggest, you tell your mom. She can definatley get you some kind of help. If you want to feel better, just do it. Stop asking how. Just say it. Just straight up say it. "Mom, I'm depressed." or "Mom, my friends are mad at me."    Since you don't have any friends to invite to your sleepover, your mom is obviously going to know you don't speak to them anymore. You NEED to tell her. Why are you so scared? You mentioned your brother has had depression issues, maybe you can talk to him, and your mom will understand more that you are depressed.     She's going to find out soon enough, so you might as well just tell her now.|`|WmkG0on3aa	just tell her, this high school drama gets under my skin, wait till you get out in the real world and have bills, and have to buy groceries and pay rent, and hope to god that you will have your job in a few months, quit cutting yourself, thats just a waste of time and its stupid, just tell her whats going on, shes your mom she'll do anything to help you, and if your worried about life now?  wait till you get in the real world.|`|PTYHS1LDaa	Well, I would try to make new friends.

Let it be your mother or your bestfriends who hate you now, explain to them why you are acting weird, and tell them about your depression.  I'm sure once you've opened up to them they will understand you more and you can all be bestfriends again.  You can also share this with your mom so she won't get worried about you, which she is by the way.  Don't cut yourself. It won't help, it might make you feel in control for a while but that won't do you any good, scars will be scars, nothing can erase that.     Hopefully you'll have someone to invite for sleep over. =)|`|DoooQw77aa	Hey! You should tell your mom that you are depressed and that you want to see a therapist because of the cutting. If you don't want to tell your mom that you are cutting yourself, you don't have to but ask her to get you help. If you don't want to ask your mom then you should go to your school counselor.  Also, why do your friends (or why do you think your friends) hate you now? Maybe you can speak to them again and try to solve whatever is going on.  And also if you feel the urge to cut yourself before you can get a therapist then there are several things you can do to try to avoid cutting yourself (you can also do these things if you are feelings depressed and they may help you). You can, for example, write the reasons why you want to cut yourself and your feelings down on a piece of paper and then rip it up into tiny pieces. Or you could do some exercise, like jogging, as exercising releases endorphins in your brain just like cutting does. Endorphins are things that make you happy. You can also scream into a pillow or punch it. You can also do a Sudoku as that requires concentration and may distract you from your problems for a while. Sometimes taking a shower helps too and makes you feel better.  You definitely need to seek (professional) help for the cutting though. If you don't you may regret it later because it leaves scars and those never go away (I know). Good luck with everything! And I hope you feel better! :)|`|jTh0Vf7saa	Buddy, at 13 Everyone is Going to tell you that you are going to be depressed. I was the same way and everyone just puts it down to hormones which I know is irritating. But The best way for you to get over girls is to move on. It sounds hard but its a life lesson, once you have given it your all you will be exhausted but you have to keep fighting. If there is no way the girl will like you again then you have to accept it and keep looking, this will be extremely tough and quite painful emotionally. Secondly, if you feel like you dont want to talk to your mom, then dont. Everyone says that you shouldnt bottle things up, and you shouldnt.   But a lot of the time you have to work yourself out of depression, Think Positive. If you are unhappy with yourself, you shouldnt harm yourself. After you have gotten through this tough spot in your life, you will make a new beginning- but the scars you have are a constant reminder of that rough time and just give you a new reason to put yourself down. If you are good at hiding depression it means you are strong, which makes me believe that you can get through it. Stand back and take a look at everything, go through it with yourself and make some changes if you have to. Talk to a friend or just ask another question on Yahoo answers, The advice people have to give comes from experience that I and many like me have.     Keep Fighting Buddy.
QTiTDz4yaa	Having a big chip on your shoulder doesn't necessarily mean you need to forgive anyone...though it might.    It could mean that you are stressed out.  Sickness and random hardship in ones life can bring you to that point.  Guilt can also do it and, in that case, forgiving ones self may be in order.    Ultimately, it is important to get to the root of the problem and deal with it.  The most important thing is just knowing that your attitude is not acceptable and you need to change.|`|6fvR8J9Kaa	if you feel like you need to forgive, you should and just forget the negative things and think of the positive|`|Hy5XeA0Waa	I totally agree with answer one, I have referred to this site for my own reasons from time to time, all the best ( :    There's no one definition of forgiveness. But in general, forgiveness is a decision to let go of resentments and thoughts of revenge. Forgiveness is the act of untying yourself from thoughts and feelings that bind you to the offence committed against you. This can reduce the power these feelings otherwise have over you, so that you can a live freer and happier life in the present. Forgiveness can even lead to feelings of understanding, empathy and compassion for the one who hurt you.|`|VR0h4L32aa	you need to forgive the ones you think have internally hurted your some way.......|`|1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	That first answer is the best thing I've ever read.

Forgiveness is not for them, it's for you.    When you forgive someone, you don't excuse their behaviour.    You simply tell yourself you'll no longer let it occupy space in your head.|`|h2aWbrouaa	i feel like that a lot actually.i stay mad at everyone i dont know why its like every little thing thatsomeone does to me i dont forgive them or forget.. i dont know... i stay angry a lot because of it and now its gotten so bad i dont know who to forgive for what..|`|rTfTZu9Laa	Newsflash:  You don't forgive people because it's a favor to them.  It's a favor to you.    But be carefull.  "Forgive" doesn't mean you stupidly make the same mistake twice with the same person.  It means you give up your emotional investment in the anger and move on.  You know the saying:  "Fool me once, ... ect."|`|hwRZ7DY7aa	I agree with the first answerer 100% plus when I feel like you it is usually in cases that I'm angry with myself. I'm angry with myself when I have let people to get away with mistreating me or being unfair to me.   Of course if you suppress your feelings they will come back to haunt you until you have to deal with them.  What I do is think through the situation, try to be as objective as possible and figure out my part in the whole story. Then I forgive myself for any mistakes I have made or I have permitted others to make on me because I know whatever has happened needed to happen for me to learn, to grow and become better.  It doesn't matter if someone has been unfair to us, it matters only if we cannot let go of it.
EaurpLufaa	My mom is raising my sister to be strong and intelligent.  I suppose there are some mothers who raise their daughters to be obsequious, but not all are like that.|`|XwqePXrOaa	Some do, some don't.<br>  <br>  My aunt is a champion bodybuilder - she could kick my ***, and probably yours too.<br>  <br>  Perhaps more generally speaking, many parents try to raise their kids so as to reflect positively on themselves, which generally involves raising them to best embody their society's ideals of success.  Thus, parents from conservative backgrounds might be ashamed of a daughter who was powerful and independent.|`|mCAWxobNaa	I disagree with this.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I don't know of any women who raise their daughters to be weak and submissive.  The mothers of daughters who I know encourage their daughters to do well at school, think about future careers etc.  They don't, as far as I know, encourage them to go around beating up boys or abusing them etc, and possibly that might be defined as 'weak and submissive' by some people.  I couldn't say.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Not this mother! And my momma didn't raise me to be that way, either!|`|cWxwHMQWaa	And fathers raise their daughters to be strong and dominant?<br>  <br>  Sure, why not ^5|`|svOneExjaa	Not me, but then again I was not raised that way either.|`|zXPGm2fraa	Yes it's more widespread than you'd think. Why? Ignorance, Naivete, that's the way they were raised, I think it's some primate brain function for procreation purposes. (If the girls are kept submissive and confidence-starved, they are more likely to stay home and make babies.) There's no logical reason to raise a daughter to have less confidence than a son, and yet it happens all the time, so there must be a non-logical, non-intellectual reason.<br>  <br>  Edit: Jimbo made a good point.|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	It seems to me that society in general raises girls to be physically submissive.  The problem is that this is seen as weakness by a society which establishes itself, even today, to some extent through force.  This would, I imagine, sow seeds of feelings of inferiority from the start, which might well translate to more intellectual confidences.  I wouldn't really know, though, I am not a girl.|`|WKtakdsOaa	My mum taught me it is more important than anything not to be weak and submissive.You definitely couldnt call my mum weak and submissive!<br>  <br>  Thats why I will always work, take care of myself and I would be disappinted in my daughter if she doesnt when she grows up. I;m tteaching my daughter she is tough and strong and she is only 1 she isnt going to be any wallflower that is evident already!|`|AA11850523	My Mom was from another generation where women didnt work FT outside of the home- she married my Dad in 1950 <br>  My Mom  never learned to drive<br>   she never went to college or had a career<br>  <br>  she  tried to raise me to be submissive to men <br>  <br>  thank goodness I didnt pay attention to her|`|x5MYW2LPaa	NBo, if anything the way I've been brought up and my mum was brought up is that women are the strong ones who hold the family together and keep things orderly.|`|PwvU3LQBaa	Ha, yeah right.

I am raising my girls to be feminine as well as proud of being a female, not to feel the need to compare themselves to men, but to embrace all their female attributes. In a way that could be weak incentives since pregnant women aren't fully capable of defending themselves when they have a big belly throwing off their center of gravity. Plus, to stay home to raise their children instead of feeling they have to also make money to feel important (which someone, somewhere might construe as submissive). But do I straight up say you are weak? No, because we have our own strengths, and I am sure most mothers feel this way and raise their daughters in that same light. It really would be difficult for a woman to go through hours of labor, take on the difficulty of raising the children and turn around and say all women are weak!|`|AA11313798	Well.. no. You are wrong in the sense that you generalized all mothers.. and you normally can't be right if you generalize everyone all one way.<br>  <br>  Even though there are some mothers that do... because of whatever reason (historical, cultural, etc).. you have to remember that there are others who don't.<br>  <br>  Some mothers don't want their daughters to be that way, and will raise them to be independent and assertive. How would you know if all mothers did that? Unless you surveyed the whole world.<br>  <br>  So it's better not to generalize, because you could get into a lot of trouble setting that in stone.<br>  <br>  So my answer to you is, No.|`|AA10584077	It's not a conscious thing, of course, but yes, for the most part, I think we still encourage women to view their girls as fragile little flowers.<br>  <br>  Ask a first-time mother who has just given birth to describe her daughter, and she'll use terms like "delicate", and "tiny", and "sweet"...<br>  Ask a first-time mother who has just given birth to describe her son, and she'll use terms like "tough", and "strong", and "hearty"...<br>  <br>  This is why I have made a personal vow -- regardless of their sex -- to view my children from day one as being "healthy" and "strong" and "sweet". =)|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	Only if the mother was weak and submissive herself.

AA11452842	When the last of these ARM loans hits bottom, things will begin to improve. Things should stabilize in about 12 to 14 months........|`|KY7RdSRGaa	The world runs on economics.

lQgXxSNcaa	YES, it does. By and large, most females raised in the period of the post-feminist revolution are reinforced with the notion of asserting themselves into a dominant position relative to males. The basis for this is that males will otherwise dominate them instead. With the advent of the PC culture, this has been extended into the domain of mass communication where the re-programming of societal norms to elevate the status of females, now implies that males are inferior. The aim is to establish females as being equal to males by weakening male standing within society. No self-respecting "strong" female will concede to being a willing participant or proponent to the social re-programming, but the outdated perception that today's world remains the domain of men only serves to propogate the wave of disdain you refer to.|`|e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	Partly that. The media has a huge influence on people, and certainly should be more responsible, and make some sitcoms that portray women as bad too. Really mature people know better, but many others, especially growing children and teens who watch this stuff get influenced by it and think it is OK to mistreat men because they deserve it.<br>  <br>  Misandry is also partly due to the incessant feminist propaganda and lies, which we cannot escape even today.|`|Qk3b5qMxaa	What?  That's an intersting hypothesis. But, I disagree. I think jerks are the only ones who really deserve disdain. They are usually the only ones who are disdained.

Paedophiles can boldly and courageously affirm what they choose. They can say that what they want is to find the best way to love.

A paedophile can say: "This closeness is possible for me within the choices that I've made."<br>  <br>  "Paedophiles are too defensive.... With boldness they can say, 'I believe this is in fact part of God's will.'<br>  <br>  PAIDIKA: You are speaking mostly about paedophiles in the U.S. What tack should they take given the societal attitudes? What solutions do you envision for their lives?<br>  <br>  "The solution I'm suggesting is that paedophiles become much more positive. They should directly attack the concept, the image, the picture of the paedophile as an evil, wicked, and reprehensible exploiter of children...<br>  <br>  "I was in the courtroom for the case that Holly just cited and I actually heard the prosecutor say, 'No man should ever be permitted to claim as an excuse that he was just being affectionate when a child says they were uncomfortable.'<br>  <br>  "I don't know; I don't think, we can just label these attitudes 'hysteria.'

I think in the end, it is some of both.  While I rarely watch tv, I see the way in which men are portrayed as dumb, way obsessed with sex, and often belittled by women because of this.  Certainly, we men in general have a more overt depiction of our desire for sex.  Also, we men have fallen behind in obtaining education as has been covered on many questions.  So in these two areas, its hard to see the link, but I don't think it is cause by tv or ads, only reinforced.<br>  <br>  As to women ripping men, I don't see this too often in real life.  My concern would be, do children pick up on the idea that women make fun of men?  If they do, certainly we would see that yes, tv has affected our society.  If this does happen, then your additional question would also be answered yes.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	No.<br>  I've watched TV my entire life, I CHOOSE not to rip apart or belittle my husband because I love him and respect him.<br>  <br>  The TV thing.....it's a cop-out.|`|wRLidVqkaa	Wow! Anyone who watches television and takes it seriously, wow. I've noticed (this is why I can't even turn the tv on anymore) that most tv shows are becoming exactly the same, it's like they all blend in together and you don't know where one starts and the other begins.<br>  <br>  I've given up on that form of medium because it's all too hockey, it takes cheap shots at everyone. TV is telling women it's ok to rip men apart, it's telling men to treat women like trophies, be scared of that terrorist that lives in some part of the world we are supposed to be 'afraid' of. Tv has become a dead source of information, it's not relevant anymore; not even the news. Less than 3 per cent of Americans read books it's time to turn off the rot box and find information in more substantiated forms of medium.|`|zXPGm2fraa	I think you are seriously onto something real, and if it's programming, no one is going to admit to it, because they are programmed.... My real opinion about it is that something seems to be going on where the almighty Media has been releasing more and more shows, movies, songs, with subtle AND overt hate messages, for everyone and about everyone, and people seem to be at an all time high for intolerance. There is no specific focal point for the hate anymore, it just seems like all groups have extremists in them who hate, hate, hate, the objectivity and respect for fellow human beings have gone right out the window. Freaking scary and doubly scary for my sons.|`|bGsXsDhBaa	I personally don't allow TV shows to influence my feelings or behavior towards other members of society<br>  <br>  However TV portrayals do reflect societal views, yes.

Xcri5qeTaa	It's about culture more than race, and it has to do with what doesn't have to be said or explained. When people are raised with the same religious, cultural, political,ethical and moral values, they basically know what to expect from each other.    Race only matters when a society is divided culturally on race.    World citizenship requires a common set of basic ethics, such as humanitarianism, to counter inevitable cultural differences.|`|xVL2BNpsaa	it is all about the "foreigner myth".

I believe you will find it better and  perhaps in some ways disappointing.  Compare fantasy verses reality to your anticipation of an event.  Let's say you fantasize about a family holiday gathering,  how it will be.  Then you go to it, and it is very real and different. Or, you imagine how a date your are going to have will go, like really romantic and exciting, etc. But when you actually go on it, it's rather dull, so disappointing.    Fantasy is your imagination, living is real.  By the way , I was "virgin" until my mid twenties.  One thing about it, it doesn't hurt, and it's very easy to catch on and make up for "lost time"!
S08uUTbbaa	Sounds like your sub-conscious is telling you that you want to get some action.  Nothing wrong with that, you should probably do it.  Anyway, unless the relationship has totally dissolved, call him up and tell him you want to meet him.  Or you could go the one-night-stand route, which is not inherently bad, but probably not the way you want to lose your virginity.  (Unless that kind of thing turns you on, in which case, go for it!)    Probably one of the reasons he broke your heart is he was wanting a little more than he was getting.  Maybe it's time to get out of your comfort zone and stop feeling dirty every time you have a sexual thought.  It's totally normal and nothing to be ashamed of.

Everything else (viruses, bacterias, shortage of food and water diseases etc) will most likely leave some humans still alive and evolve again. <br>  If you equate human race with our civilization, than of course we are talking about different factors.

rTfTZu9Laa	The most important thing to understand with this issue is this:  BEWARE OF WELL MEANING ADVICE.  People would always like to believe that people magically change.  The truth is, people ALMOST NEVER CHANGE.    The misnomer is that people change because they change their personality.  The opposite is true.  People change because the changes are already consistant with the personality they have.    Now comes the bad news.  If you expect someone to change in ways that don't fit who they already are, you may waste years of time and never see anything that lasts.  They will always return to old behavior if they budge an inch to begin with.    Thare's an old saying you find in all self-help groups:  "You can't change people."  This is not just a throw away line.  Many people literally waste their entire lives waiting for a single individual in their life to make changes that will never happen.|`|oHo2VGGgaa	Somebody telling them they need to change and why|`|xVL2BNpsaa	motivation is a very tricky thing.

1NCPPHR9aa	My understanding is that in the formative years from 0 to 5, people that are later termed sociopath had to take on a survival role instead of being a nurtured child. Thus they didn't learn empathy for others. It's complex to explain here, but I believe that is the answer to your question.

Some decision are based on the first impulse not really thinking what will be the outcome of such decision. Very few really sought help or analyze the decision they will make. It is always two persons in one body; the good and the not so good. Their issues are more on their physical appearance, boys/girls, sex, booze, smoking, partying, drinking, studying. And kudos to those whose priorities are family,studies and getting a good job.|`|F08qx2hgaa	Love/Attraction- They must decide whom they are attracted to and if these people could ever play a proper role in their lives when they are older. They must decide love from like and lust and infatuation. <br>  -This could make them naive and vulnerable. It could make them angry, confused and depressed as they get hurt. When they do the hurting, this could prepare them for life or make them harsh.<br>  <br>  Race/Discrimination- Also a sort of identity, race is a complicated issue. Should they be afraid of other races, within reason, if there is reason? What is discrimination? They themselves will get judged not only for their race, but because they're a teenager. Double whammy, right there! <br>  - Their struggles could make them a better or worse person- it depends on the circumstances, and on how they handle what's around them.<br>  <br>  Identity- The question of "Who Am I?" surfaces as their bodies change, their emotions go wacky and they try to find their place in the world. Some cling to childhood, others cling to adulthood. Which is better?<br>  - A teen may continue to act childish for fear of lost time or growing up too fast. <br>  - A teen could take on too many challenges at once and end up growing older and wiser at a young age. Is this fair; is it inevitable? Will the world eventually get to everyone?<br>  <br>  Family- Teens have a hard time with this concept. Brothers and sisters die young, as do parents and relatives. Their view of what a "real" family is twisted and sad. Is a drunk father, a teen and a younger child a "family?" Are a teen and their grandparents or foster parents a "family"?<br>  <br>  Change- People, times, home and friends change. They change. Change is inevitable as time goes on. Their beloeved heroes become hypocrits, their friends dump them for higher social status and they themselves are so confused, so mind-boggled that they crave regulation, order and sense. <br>  <br>  Teenagers must decide who they want to be in their lives, and shape themselves as such. They must decide what is best for the world around them, the people and themselves. <br>  <br>  Teens face the same issues as anyone grown yet they seem to go through so much more... as the world grows older, is it getting harsher, or are more truths simply revealed than ever before (such as abuse, rape and "new" morals)?|`|85Co7zE8aa	a lot of teens go through self esteem crap.

And it wasn't "one feminist", it was at least 7 people who had actually bothered to read a book or gawd forbid - take a university course - in anthropology or sociology. <br>  <br>  Sociology 101, Introduction to Sociology: In the beginning, there were GATHERER-HUNTER societies... Gatherer-hunter societies were typically no larger than about 40 persons so population levels would not outstrip available resources. If that had been allowed to happen, none of us would be here today. Gatherer-hunter societies were the most egalitarian of all human societies and agrarian societies the least egalitarian. <br>  <br>  Forms of Human societies include: <br>  <br>  - gatherer-hunter societies <br>  - horticultural societies <br>  - herding societies <br>  - fishing societies <br>  - agrarian societies <br>  - industrial societies <br>  - post-industrial societies <br>  <br>  Thanks for your interest, now read a book.

That evolutionary processes have diversified the two genders is, doubtless, significant, but has no bearing on the importance of sexual reproduction.

urNeu95Saa	Good question.  PSY is a great study because of all the unanswerable questions.  I am certain that you know the fundamental difference between psychiatry and psychology is "prescription".  My personal thoughts go like this.  There are certain, scientifically proven, disorders that only medication can level out or reduce symptoms.  On the other hand, there are many more "brain" issues that can be cured/understood through psychological means (talking, drilling down issues that manifest over each other, phobia resolution and on and on).  If I remember correctly through my college degrees, reports show that the best therapy for MAJOR psych issues involve medicine WITH psychological counseling.  Of course, if the person has such a condition they are unable to reason, then this wouldn't be true.  There are other conditions that medicine just isn't necessary.  Study up on the mechanics of the brain.  Once you understand the fundamentals of that then look at what neuroleptic(sp?) medicine does to the brain.  Then you might arrive at your own conclusion about the question.  BASICALLY there is no such neuroleptic medicine that can effect just one transmitter or receptor.  Those things control many functions.  So when you inhibit or excite, there is ALWAYS side effects.  Some really bad, and some not so bad...  There is MUCH to consider about the answer you are looking for. <br>  <br>  Its a great question with a long answer...

It was about his episode with psychosis.  During his psychosis he became psychic.  After he got better, he lost it.   They say creative people are more prone to mental illness and depression.  So it seems maybe insanity is part of 'another country' in the brain where things go on that are non-rational but valuable.  I worked at a half way house for the mentally ill and most of them were raving hallucinating lunatics but through their delusions and ramblings I always felt they were using the imagery to express emotional truths that were valid  that most of us just brush under the rug.

xVL2BNpsaa	You know how the saying goes...A friend in need is a friend indeed.   Somebody who thinks about you, who calls you when you need a shoulder to cry on, who come with an advice, who gives you space and at the same time is always there when you need, that is a real friend.
ul6P8doWaa	A lot of things can be contributing factors to the current economic crisis, some of which are bigger then others.   Among some of the bigger ones are the lenient lending of money to home buyers from lenders all across the country;  Largely made possible and supported by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  This is one of the reason why so many people who shouldn't have qualified to take out such loans in the first place are loosing their homes.   Those very same lenders are being forced to foreclosed on homes that the owners can no longer make their mortgage payments on.  Another big contribution of the current economic crisis is that all the domestic jobs are being sent over seas and to other countries;   This obviously explains all the lay-offs and shutting down of domestic companies across the country.  Employers are experiencing profit loss and therefore, are left with no other options but to down-size, permanently close their doors, and file for bankruptcies.  They are loosing all their customers and those customers in turn, are also loosing their customers and it continues on with a downward spiral.  And who suffers most?  The working middle-class.  And last but not least, the current war in the Middle East;  Average spending to maintain troops and military's standing over there is approximately 6 billions a month since it started.  This pretty much explains why there isn't enough money and funds avaliable domestically to stimulate our economy and why the economic stimulus package (787 billion) was signed just a few days ago by President Obama.  <br>  <br>  **Hopefully, that explained a little if not much.|`|AcgDcQG0aa	Too much borrowing and indebtedness in the private sector.<br>  <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2009/01/brink-of-debt-disaster.html" rel="nofollow">http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.c...</a>|`|KY7RdSRGaa	In short, it is the banks who lended money to people who could not afford it, putting many houses in foreclosure.

CCf6Y7DIaa	no offense tori, but 'blacked out' is a drug term made popular in the 60s that refers to a state of such severe intoxication that the brain can no longer maintain consciousness; you cannot dream if you 'black out' -ergo, you were not 'blacked out' :p 'passed out' is perhaps more appropriate.<br>  <br>  with that said, i have no idea what the symbology in your dream means. what are your personal beliefs? -what do these symbols mean to YOU? what is happening in your life? why do you think this dream is significant? what is your life lacking? what does this dream give you that your life lacks? what does this dream give you that your life has? each of these questions are important for understanding the meanings and symbology of dreams.<br>  <br>  <br>  i am of the opinion that the meaning will be relative to your personal understanding, relationships and needs in life; metaphysical explanations that accede to _others'_ beliefs ought to be taken with a -hefty- grain of salt. think deeply on the meaning using the questions i posed about your own life, experiences, needs and wants to find the answer. -that's where it should lay, buried in your subconscious; that's where the dream came from, after all! :D|`|tTIXhe7daa	You better leave that stuff alone.

sX9Ilrpxaa	Actually, a human skeletal biologist can make fairly accurate predictions about someone's ethnicity from a well-preserved skeleton.  Some skeletal traits, especially in the cranium (e.g. height of cheekbones, shape of eye sockets, width of nasal structures, jaw robusticity). Of course, this is not definite because there is some overlap between different populations.  You can say, however, that a skeleton exhibits African, Asian, or European features.  This is helpful for identifying individuals, but takes a great deal of experience in osteology.  <br>  <br>  As far as DNA testing goes, you can almost definitely figure out an individuals ethnic affinity.  However, this testing is extremely expensive and time-consuming.  Also, testable DNA is not always preserved.|`|kV9YT6bSaa	Well you can tell from your DNA, but your DNA and a human skeleton is completely different.

There is a specific genetic characteristic that makes it possible to tell a black person from white sometimes.

White people or Europeans in general with blond hair and blue eyes, for another example, are actually genetically different than their brown haired, brown eyed counterparts.|`|IVGGvxVIaa	In addition to the answer above I might add that there are fairly good databases that you can feed with your measurements of the bones and get a rather reliable answer as to which ethnic group the person belonged to. <br>  Your DNA will tell you exactly and can also help you trace your history back quite a while...

That is disrespectful to them. You want to convey that you don't want to listen to them. <br>  Yawn constantly when someone is talking to you. That tells them they are boring you. Even Better: If you constantly yawn loudly. <br>  Get up and leave during a conversation. Again, that's disrespect that no one will like. <br>  Tell them they are boring you and be very nasty about it. <br>  Be preoccupied with other things while someone is talking to you. <br>  After someone has finished talking, say "what did you say?" Repeat as many times as necessary, they'll soon get the hint. <br>  If they complain about your being rude, then say "I know you are, but what am I?" It will make them angry and after awhile they won't have a comeback. <br>  Talk on your cell phone while someone is talking to you. In fact, take out your cell phone and start calling someone while the other person is talking to you. Answer your cell phone when it rings and talk loudly (if possible), tell the person on your cell phone that you're not talking to anyone importannt, but you can talk to them. That will really make someone mad at you. <br>  Tell someone to jump off a cliff. They will never talk to you again. <br>  Throw a "negative compliment" at someone. Say "I love your style, you have the street walker look going on," or "I like your outfit. You seem to have the 'I'm-a-bum' look going. Very nice." That will make them angry. NOTE: You'll also elicit a response, so just make sure you're prepared for the aftermath. <br>  Interrupt them every chance you get. Make it so they don't have a chaince to get involved in the conversation. Be a conversation hog. <br>  Insult them. Use words like stupid, idiot, moron, low-life, simpleton, etc. Even Better: If you can use them all in one sentence. Use phrases like "I bet your parents must be proud (sarcastically)," "You are the low-life of society," "I pitty the fool who procreated you," etc. NOTE: Just be prepared for any response these comments might bring you. <br>  Disrespect their parents, kids, or spouse. NOTE: Don't be surprised if you get punched for it. <br>  Insult whatever they take pride in. If they think they are good at fishing, tell them they're not. If they're proud of their education, tell them they should ask for their money back because they didn't learn anything.

7J6m0L3Haa	Agree 100%. I contributed to a bigger feminist blog and ran my own before I got too bogged down with law school. Threats like that are extremely common. I usually average 2-4 sexually explicit, insulting, or threatening emails from this site alone a week. I have to have the policy now of choosing gender-neutral screen names if I want to stay unharassed.<br>  <br>  It's common here too because sexists flock to GWS like bees to honey to get their cheap thrills demeaning women. They purposefully manipulate the anonymity and the ability to have more than one profile to troll to their heart's content. I can't imagine people posting in the Physics section, for instance, if they have no knowledge of Physics. But many think it perfectly acceptable here to post hate and bigotry under the domain of "Gender Studies" that they actually know nothing about.<br>  <br>  I honestly do think that Yahoo should do something to crack down on this and the trolling in sections like the LGBTQ and mens and womens health. There's far too many posts here that are repeats of the same thing over and over again or unduly inflammatory or just plain false.<br>  <br>  Also, thanks for the second link in your question.

There are no repercussions behind the faceless words of anonymity. People tend to abandon normal interpersonal communication concepts and adopt impersonal ones because of this lack of Person-Centerdness. Self serving biases and fundamental attribution errors run rampant because everyone has an agenda to propose or expose. <br>  <br>  Everyone that comes to GWS has experienced or holds some form of bias or trauma or has some conviction that keeps them coming back for affirmation regarding a particular issue within the realm of gender studies. This coagulation of varied and contentious perspectives creates a cesspool of vitriol and blame philosophy which causes a never ending oroborus effect. Trying to break the cycle is harder than it appears.<br>  <br>  People walk through life harboring these sentiments,some seeking closure to their trauma, some addicted to the rush of judgement, some think that they are footsoldiers in a grander scheme,  some simply want to stir the pot. All in all though the opinions here in the immaterial really have no physical affect on how we act in the real world...well not for some.<br>  <br>  Thats why I will always respect actions over opinions. Actions are tangible. Opinions...not so much.<br>  <br>  Maybe people should spend more time performing positive actions in relation toward gender issues in their daily lives instead of participating in mere conjecture in an internet forum where nothing really gets accomplished...would certainly help quench the boredom.|`|1TCNW8lBaa	In America, feminism has led to an increase of workload among married women, as many now have a job, child responsibilities, AND most of the chores, and men have been shown to actually do less work then when the feminist movement started.<br>  <br>  The double income families also led to a large raise in housing prices as more couples could afford homes.<br>  <br>  I do think that families were better off with wives staying home, however, i do not believe that men are superior to women in any way. i am not sexist.|`|e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	What's wrong with criticizing feminism?

Nobody will go to their sites (like the ones that patriarch dudes suggested google search lead immediately to) so they hang out where they are good for nothing but attempts at intimidation.  I realize their garbage is shocking at first, but eventually, it becomes so redundant as to be boring.<br>  <br>  I like it here.  A lot.  I just found this place the other day, and I really like the format.  I thought the mra/feminist/woman haters were greater in number than they actually are, and was surprised by that at first.  That was before I realized how many different identities they use, though. That's impossible on a lot of sites, and can be caught any number of ways.  But once I realized how few in number they are, and that I had dealt with some of them before,  I got over the surprise.  I live in a working loft, where one of the rules is that I have to be at home during business hours, so I'm chained to my house.  My work doesn't require constant attention (I make jewelry) so I've been hanging out here.  I probably wouldn't have stuck around as much if it weren't for the mra/feminist/woman haters, as I believe they should be countered and exposed at every opportunity (kind of like they think they're doing with feminism, even as the movement trods along, right on schedule).  I also want some of the women who are curious about feminism to know as quickly as possible just who is making the wackadoodle noise.  But honestly, it's not only altruistic reasons that I'm here for.  I find it entertaining, and most of the posters are enlightening.  <br>  <br>  I really can't think of a site, this one or otherwise, that is ruled by the sexists.  They're annoying in their pedantic ways, but we all know they are not getting the desired effect.  Great conversations still go on at all of the blogs, and we are all still communicating as always.

The web is a bad place to post anything personal-Its a place where people let out their emotions, and/or try to make other people miserable because they are bullied themselves. I've never been bullied, and never have bullied anyone. Uhh, that's kind of far off, but just translating=Technology new frontier for bullying.

I've been having a very interesting time in GWS. It is neither beautiful nor horrible. <br>  <br>  I have been recuperating from a broken leg and forced to sit still for a few weeks (aargh) so this answers thing beckoned as a time-filler. I usually only answered questions in my area of professional expertise, as an occasional diversion from insomnia, but an open general question sucked me in.<br>  <br>  I thought there might be a bit of debate, a lot of ignorance and some questions I could help with. I did not expect the intensity of prejudice, reaction, furious generalising, and open expressions of hatred I found here!<br>  <br>  So after reading, asking and thinking, I became a bit more familiar with the patterns and issues and began to find it deeply fascinating. I also (to my surprise, once I realised what was happening) found myself forced to recognise how much my own attitudes had changed over the years since I first engaged with these sorts of issues. <br>  <br>  Overall I have become much more pragmatic and patient with individuals, and much less patient with cookie-cutter ideology. I don't think I was exactly brainwashed as a young feminist, but I think times and attitudes have changed A LOT and it's imperative to keep confronting oneself (via dialogue with others) in pursuit of authenticity. <br>  <br>  We cannot seriously just buy the book and recite the dogma; it only works as historical context. This is true for every social issue.<br>  <br>  One of the most fascinating things that happened recently is that someone posted an absolutely spot-on performance video (I think it was called Girl, Exploded) under the apparent impression that he was going to excite a chorus of gleeful agreement that all women are hysterical. It sailed right by him but it didn't matter, he put it out there. <br>  <br>  So when people ask things like "why do people use this forum for dialogue, it's supposed to be questions only", well, all I can think is that it's vastly more exciting this way. I had a quick scan just now through the more utilitarian classifications and they are all working in the appropriate way for their subject matter. <br>  <br>  GWS is ferociously democratic. Look how seldom a question just gets abandoned to voting. They get pounced on, debated till they're wrung out and resolved. As befits the subject area. If there were a foolproof way to make everyone be in agreement all the time, we wouldn't have any social issues to debate at all. (Not that I think debate is an ideal to pursue; I just think it's necessary.)<br>  <br>  Of course the cowardly or malicious behaviour that just gums up the works, like ganging up on people or having them banned or whatever that is, is just stupid. So is the automatic "I have a hangnail, damn those feminists." And the squillion other tactics that could make a person despair for the human race...<br>  <br>  But fortunately I'm more of an optimist. I have truly enjoyed the ride and I'll miss it when I go back to work.

pzLDXL6gaa	I have sex because I like it, and it's with men because I'm straight.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|svOneExjaa	So, you have noticed... In our teens and twenties we identify with the way we look to ourselves and others, because we don't know who we are as individuals yet. Life is a popularity contest of sorts for us at that age. And some of us would do practically anything to fit in. We don't even think about what we want personally, as long as the deed is helping us to become popular with the 'in crowd'. Hopefully, this self destructive time is used as a life lesson on a road of self discovery, because otherwise it is just a waste of time. <br>  <br>  It takes us years to learn who we are individually, sexually and independently of the things we do and people we do it all with. However, only self knowledge and acceptance are reasons for our ability to lose inhibitions and enjoy life in its all forms. Then again some of us never reach that blessed state of mind at all... What a waste really...|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Like teen girls? For men. The ones I've known anyhow. Not all, but the majority. <br>  <br>  Early teens, in the later teens it started to shift, and then by 20s they were almost all actually into it. <br>  <br>  I flashed when I was like 10. The novelty of breasts hadn't worn off, I did it because it was fun. Being dared to do it sorta deal. <br>  <br>  I always had my queer exhibitionist streak.

Not really "pressured" and they didn't hate it, but they were sorta "meh" about it.|`|zXPGm2fraa	Yes, and esp. young women. They believe that they are liked and have a special bond and that's why the man wants to have sex... They honestly almost never know that sex and emotion are not intertwined for a lot of men like they are for many women. It's something most women learn the hardest way, by being used for sex and then discarded like yesterday's toy.|`|WlLcttM2aa	This is an interesting question.<br>  <br>  It depends on their level of self confidence, and on the man they're with. If a girl has lower self-worth, and if the guy she's with is pressuring her (even if he's not, some girls "feel" pressure that may or may not be there. Such as "oh, even though he didn't ask for it, I know he wants it so I guess I'll do it for him." In this case, it's not the guy's fault at all.) then she would be more likely to do it for him. <br>  <br>  But if she has more confidence in herself, she'll be more likely to do it because she wants it and she'll like it too, not just to please him.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	I only take nude pics so I can look at them and stare at how hot I am.|`|tyuxbdrnaa	Most young women have had the occasion to have sex "for men", for the pleasure or acceptance of the man.<br>  Most mature women, have figured out their bodies, know what they like, and become active participants, enjoying the experience for the pleasure we give and receive.<br>  Though most of those adventurous ideas, would be on an individual basis.

xUfRRGM8aa	Well I don't know you and am certainly seeing one side of your situation.....but remember It is not age that brings wisdom. Think of all the ignorant people your age. Without a desire to better themselves through exploration and education they will become ignorant adults. And if there are ignorant adults and brilliant adults there is certainly a vast gray area bridging the two. This is where the masses live....and they spend there lives just getting by and fitting in. They are the first to imply youth is equivalent to naivety and that age is equivalent to wisdom. The gray area is thick with fear. And fear lashes out at what is different. So when people belittle you or take what you say with a grain of salt.....it is probably because they do not think you have enough visceral experience to find validity in what you say....or perhaps they are afraid of performing a social taboo and trusting youth over age. Either way all you can do is pay the same dues of youth that we all did and absorb all the knowledge you can so that when your age and "reliability" meet you will be a force to be reckoned with. <br>  <br>  Or I suppose, become so extraordinary at something now, people will have to notice;)|`|CwNMq7RTaa	It'a an ingrained thing in our culture that adults are more important.  It's stupid.  They have more power so they have the power to minimize those who are younger.  But it's not true.  You're as important as any adult.  A   5 year old is just as important.  No one is more important than anyone.  You know that.  Don't let cultural attitudes bring you down.|`|bf4757f4f354855ce33fb48482a8ccb5aa	Because I'm not confused or misguided.

As you get older, you see things differently, and that may be why some people don't take teens seriously.<br>  <br>  As far as what you've had to go through, you obviously have been dealt a "full" hand and am sure you have more maturity and experiences compared to others your age.<br>  <br>  All ages have something to offer in this life, so don't let others bring you down.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|9UQlhzitaa	take a breath after that mouthful would ya<br>  <br>  you are by no means less important but your age group in general is<br>  <br>  you are the exception to the rule and those who get to know you will see that ;keep up the good work;if it gets to be too much turn to your local church and your Friends<br>  <br>  good luck and may God bless you|`|15325f844578cef2a263d3c63171554eaa	ageism follows you throughout life and becomes faded more and more the older you become, when someone places blame of your actions solely on your age and cant WHEN questioned, provide something more rational in place of this, then your perhaps a victim of a very raw version of it and at teenage ranges its very common to see it, i remember feeling very alienated when i was that age because of it, and now im 25 now and feel that less but its still there and doesnt just disappear as you become legally an adult depending on what state....people will take you seriously when you have something good to say, and some people will spite you for it, attempt to question those questioning you, test them, when they fail, you wont worry about it, be sure not to be too proud, and a scholarship is rare, you dont need one to make it through college, but boy does it make it easier....and really you sound like your being alienated about your sexuality and im sorry that your being treated that way, trust me, it has nothing to do with age, people always know, if its a parent i'd do everything i could to help bring those of your family to lighten this obviously dim perspective on the subject, its not wrong to see a lack of judgement, and anyone who procreates thinks back and says oh man was i thinkin with my junk when i did that, and this is coming from someone who hasnt, but i theorize it constantly, considering the loss involved in doing such things its understandable, but can be expressed in displaced ways, such as your example...*sigh*|`|AA11695315	The only way someone can be more important than you - is if you allow them to feel that way. Sometimes it is easy for people of a older age to discount someone younger. It doesn't mean you are less important just that some are more experienced. <br>  All that aside though you know who you are and what you know. Don't let others make you feel inferior. Age is just a number.<br>  But by attacking or being combative it comes off as childish. Don't give others that satisfaction.|`|EZ1cPPvkaa	Well, let me be the first to point out that you're making a rather huge generalization about all adults, when it is a generalization about teenagers that you're upset about.  <br>  I am also under 21 and it can be frustrating to deal with people of any age who are condescending.  It sounds like you're doing just fine despite the adults in your life who have given you this reaction, so the only solution is to make a resolution not to let it bother you.  You don't need to justify yourself to complete strangers.|`|wD86088oaa	I don't think age is truly a factor. There are many adults who behave as if they were sixteen. There are also many teenagers who behave as if they were forty-five. I'm not quite sure what makes an adult an adult. It definitely isn't the amount of work they do. Or how well they multitask work and home matters. Maturity itself seems to be the mentality of the sheep. Yet, there is a major divide between adulthood and adolescence. I think it has to do with the differing perceptions of world due to experience.<br>  <br>  Despite all this hoopla of what make an adult an adult, I think your real problem is the feeling of not being able to make your own decisions. If you believe yourself to be gay, you are gay. You could have come to that realization during puberty. <br>  <br>  As for History and Language Arts, you might know quite a bit more about these subjects than the people you know. But you do not know everybody. Your statement, "I probably know more then (should be "than") YOU do<-(unneeded word) when it <-(undefined) comes to history (should be "History") and/or <-(cannot be both in this instance) Language Arts," comes off cocky. You better check yourself before you wreck yourself.|`|AA10292836	Sometimes we have to endure things that should never be,but make your influence count,use it,and you have the power to change the world,even if it helps one person,so you see you are on a journey and know life,now you have to accept it,and sometimes it's not right!|`|1NCPPHR9aa	I don't know who is putting you down. I guess they have no idea what kind of guy you are. <br>  I know what you are going through because I was emancipated at 16 years old and when I went to high school, no one had any idea of the life I had already lived. You can't judge a book by it's cover and Bravo to you for being more responsible than a lot of people I know who are much older than you.<br>  One other thing, Don't let others make life decisions for you, they may only hold you back from your full potential.
czMprYUvaa	Because it's easier to deal with. It is a way to block it out and ignore it. This in turn gives them temporary relief and makes the person able to push there faults out of their minds so much that it becomes an idea. The more distance that is created by blocking out personal flaws, the more detached that part of a person becomes and then it is easier for the person to begin to lie to themself. Basically it's out of fear of actually knowing who they really are, every aspect of themselves , good or bad. These people just can't face this other side of themselves because they are afraid of viewing themselves in a negative light aka different from what they may think they really are

2C1C3Zfyaa	Okay sensation is something automatic. It includes your sights, sounds, tastes, touches, and smells. If you walk into a room you cannot help that you saw that fly on the wall or that the room smelt of clorox. However how you perceive is different. It can vary according to experience for example: if your mom has flower wallpaper in her bathroom then when you saw that fly it might have reminded you of that wallpaper. Or lets look at it this way. My friend does not mind the smell of skunk. The smell is her sensation, the fact that it doesn't bother her is her personal perception. In my case I hate the way skunk smells therefore I have a different perception of that smell.

7EV9fqM3aa	I agree with that quote. America is a Puritanical nation and, as such we do still stigmatize sex with shame. We don't talk about it, we hide it, and we consider it dirty and naughty. We are more concerned about whether we should be having sex or not (adults, too, not just teens) than we are with the end results of sex. <br>  <br>  An abstinence only approach only works for the people who agree with it. Teaching only abstinence to teens does nothing to discourage sex, does nothing to give them the tools and knowledge to prevent both unwanted pregnancies and STDs, and really only underscores the association of shame with sex.<br>  <br>  We need to learn to trust our children and ourselves enough to allow them to make their own fully informed decisions. We need to trust that we have taught them our good values and not think them too stupid to realize that knowing how and when to use a condom is not the same as saying: "do everyone in sight." <br>  <br>  We may as well be telling our children not to drive ever because they could be killed in an accident. At some point they are going to want to drive and will, eventually, even if without our permission. They should know how to do so safely. We let them learn how to drive and we make sure they know how to be a responsible driver. It's a huge risk because an irresponsible driver can kill them at any given time regardless of how well they have learned. We tell our children the dangers of driving drunk without fearing that telling them people do drive drunk will make them think they should drive drunk.<br>  <br>  We don't think they are that stupid.<br>  <br>  With sex we do think they are that stupid. If we dare tell them how to stay safe if they do make a choice we think is wrong we are somehow encouraging that choice? <br>  <br>  In sex education, full, comprehensive, uncensored knowledge can do far more to save lives than any wisdom on safe driving. Stick a kid in a car in a parking lot, let him go wild, and, eventually, he will figure out how things work and what is safe, assuming, of course, we have taught him how and why we want to be safe.<br>  <br>  Sex doesn't work that way. You can tell a kid that sex leads to disease and pregnancy, even that it will lead to Hell, but, eventually, he will need to make his own choice. If he chooses "wrong" wouldn't we still want him to know how to be safe?|`|tyuxbdrnaa	I don't think America's problem is that people argue weather its ok to have sex or not.<br>  Teens ARE having sex, plenty of it, whether people like it or not.<br>  Teens have Plenty of access to birth control, you can buy it or get it for free at the clinics.<br>  Teens, here, also know that if they do get pregnant, everything they need will be provided for them...<br>  WIC provides food for pregnant mom and baby<br>  Medi-cal covers birth related medical expenses/delivery<br>  and as long as you don't live with parents/adults that can support you, you get welfare, cash aid, free child care, etc.<br>  Perhaps, there just isn't enough of a deterrent, since every things handed to the teen parent, with no debt/payback responsibility clause.<br>  Edit: <br>  I can't answer the European part of the question, as I don't know their situation. Do European teens get everything provided to them free of charge like American teens do?<br>  Seems to me...no matter what country, if these kids had to work to support their offspring, it would be a huge deterrant.|`|IwUpusQiaa	i think young adults/teens need to be more educated on safe sex, different forms of contraception, ways to get birth control, etc.<br>  it's still considered taboo at times to discuss teens having sex (it's often considered a scandal of some sort), if talking about it became the norm, people would be more knowledgeable than having information kept hush-hush.<br>  <br>  i believe i read this article before, and it brings up a good point.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I think I am somewhat older than most of the posters here...but teens today are not much different than they were 30 years ago.<br>  <br>  Sex existed.<br>  Kids had sex.<br>  Kids forgot about "birth control".<br>  Some got pregnant...some did not.<br>  <br>  When I got to college, I had a plan. If I met someone and got involved, I knew exactly where to go for contraception. No "just this once"...not for me. Most of the girls I knew were insane. They would drink, sleep with their dates, and two weeks later would be literally praying for their periods to begin. Month in, and month out...the same nonsense.<br>  <br>  After loaning a dozen girls my name so they could have pregnancy tests, I finally made a rule. If you used my name for one, you had to go to Family Planning with me, get yourself checked out and tested, and obtain birth control. That was it. <br>  <br>  Half a dozen young women did it...and none of them got pregnant in college after that. But kids today are just as baffled by sex as they were 30 years ago. They simply don't connect sex with pregnancy---or the consequences.  They say 30 is the new 20...and that's true, God help us all...because these kids don't ever want to grow up...not really.|`|nyq0gqpOaa	Sounds sexy, congratulations on your article in the Times!|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	We need more abstinence education instead of teaching our kids to be hobags.|`|BkleL3F4aa	You should take me off your blocked list, you silly woman.|`|ToehkII4aa	I think America's problem is that people dont argue much on weather  to have sex or not since its so freely available .<br>  Teens ARE having sex,  whether anyone likes it or not.<br>  They have easy access to birth control, they can buy it or get it for free at the clinics.<br>  here, they also know that on gettting pregnant,things they <br>  need are provided for them without much to worry.<br>  WIC will provide food for pregnant mom and baby<br>  Medi-cal will cover birth related medical expenses/delivery chargesetc.<br>  and as long as they don't live with parents to support, they get welfare, cash aid, free child care, etc.<br>  And there isn't  a deterrent even by the society, since things are handed to the teen parent, with no payback responsibility clause.which gives them the courage and the guts to be so carefree and reckless in thier attitude towards life and the newer generation is found to be missing i\on the emotional attachment s or the family bondings too.<br>  Any  deterrent from the society,familly and the helping institutions may help it reduce drastically from the present situation
0ab8f575413fd8ca62f22acb1bee81fbaa	First of all, unless there is a bigger story behind your relationship problem,  your boyfriend is a jerk.<br>  <br>  Secondly, it is AWESOME to put others before you. NEVER stop doing that, ALWAYS care for others. It is so worthwhile. However, being a pushover is not good and it is important to stand up for yourself. It is possible to be a strong person while caring for others...these are the things I would suggest:<br>  <br>  1. It depends what you mean by pushover. Are you compromising yourself morally or just overcommitting? If it's the former, you need to sit down and define what your standards are, and be sure not to cross them.<br>  <br>  2. Read The Overload Syndrome. It's awesome.<br>  <br>  3. Remember that doing everything a person asks you is not good for them. Being a pushover myself, I understand that it feels selfish to say not to people, but the fact is, when I overload myself, I am being selfish because, really, I just want them to like me. So, keep in mind what is best for the person who is asking favors of you. Sometimes, what is best for a person is figuring out their problems instead of having someone fix  them. <br>  <br>  4. Remember that, if you overcommit yourself, you are doing a disservice to the people you have committed to. You can't give yourself 100% if you are exhausted and preoccupied.<br>  <br>  Really, though, the best advice would be to<br>  5. Stand up for yourself and<br>  6. Don't be a pushover|`|az9IYqleaa	I'm exactly like you! hmm... im not sure...<br>  <br>  the reason why you are so nice is maybe because you want to be accepted by people.

I assume this is why your bf is getting fed up, jealousy or he is looking for a way out.  Anyway learning to recondition yourself isn't easy.  First you need to learn to say no.  When you are asked to do something you don't want to do simply say... sorry I can't do that right now or whatever but don't do it.  When you get comfortable saying no then the next step is being assertive to get what you want.

Now I know that sounds weird but I've found in doing followup checks with people who have had very severe phobias that they often forget how bad it used to be!<br>  <br>  Good luck
