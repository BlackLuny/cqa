Honestly, it would be terrible. Please give me some advice. I know I've made mistakes and I will never be so foolish again. Thank you.

Is is okay to take centrum forte and vitamin D at the same time even though it says on the centrum forte that to take this medicine after 4 hours of taking other medicines or to take before 4 hours before taking other medicines. The doctor said i need 1000 units of vitamin D but centrum forte only has 600 so, and the other has 400 so it add up to 1000 units of Vitamin D.      Is Vitamin D actually considered as a "MEDICINE" or JUST    Vitamin D?      If i cant take them together should i take the centrum forte morning and the vitamin D at night.      P.S  The pharmacist told me to take both so it add up to 1000 units of vitamin D but i don't know that did the pharmacist knew that you shoulnt take any other medicine unless it is after 4 hours.

People keep making comments such as "You're way too thin, gain some weight." etc. These are friends of mine, and it really upsets me, as I've never tried to be "thin". I like to eat (a lot haha) I guess I'm just lucky?   I'm 5'7" and I weigh about 8 stone 11lbs (32-23-35). I don't eat unhealthily and I do some exercise, but not excessively so.   It's really starting to get me down, as I've never thought of myself as "too thin", although I don't have love-handles or anything, just muscle and a narrow waist.      Why do people think it's okay to tell others to gain weight, but not to lose it? It's just as confidence-shaking to be told you're too thin.

20090306172622AAmDCs5	Health;Women's Health	Starting a fundraiser for a friend?	My best friend of 20 years is going through the most horrific situation. She's recently divorced and has 7 kids (she's 36). Anyhow, her ex is the most abusive person one would ever meet. Last year she was able to be strong enough to divorce the monster, no matter what. She didn't want to fight for money or anything...she just wanted her sanity. They agreed he would pay $900 a month in child support and she could live in the house. But of course, that gives him access to continue to abuse her and use the kids as a tool to try to abuse her (like take them and not telling her when he would return). The story is so long and detailed, but the bottom line, I want to try to do a fundraiser for her so she can start her life away from him. Does anyone have any good suggestions for this situation?

The tooth was badly abscessed and the swelling's finally starting to go down now.  I've been brushing my teeth though considering that the drainage from the abscess has been making my teeth kinda nasty.  Tonight which is Friday I brushed and I can feel the stitches just hanging like untied shoes.  The dentist told me the stitches would go away on their own but I don't remember if it was by falling out or dissolving.  Should I just not worry about it and let the stitches do what they're going to do or should I give my dentist a call.  I won't be able to call until Monday though and I'm sure loose stitches aren't something the ER would care about.  Also was I wrong for continuing to brush my teeth I mean I don't want my mouth to be nasty from not brushing.
20090306221213AADRrJG	Health;Women's Health	Does Kotex's advertisement seem crude to you too?	They must think they are real creative geniuses putting a red dot or "period" on the box and proclaiming "Kotex fits, PERIOD."  I am sorry but to me that is uncouth and crude. I don't think using the word period in their slogan is so genius or creative but rather silly and crude advertisement, I also think the red decorations on their packaging is also painfully obvious and not discreet or inconspicuous the way I believe feminine hygiene products should be.  Am I the only woman who feels this way?  That their advertising team must be immature and uncreative men?      While I'm on a role, what do you think of Secret deoderant's new slogan "Because your hot."  I think once again, it is rather uncreative and silly.  Sorry if I seem to rant, I don't beleive in obvious advertising slogans.  It makes me feel cheesy when I hear that slogan and reminds me of when I was having a panick attack and said I'm HOT, turn on the air to my husband we were on a trip in the car with the in laws and my father in law said...that is what Randy (my husband) says to you all the time..

20090306204953AADX3Q9	Health;Women's Health	Throat feels like its closing almost constantly now.?	I've been to SEVERAL dr appts because of having almost constant anxiety attack symptoms.  I've had this for the past 2 months just after having my car break down. (I live with 3 rowdy kids, car keeps breaking, cant find a job, money getting low, dad died 8 months ago unexpectedly).  All my symptoms include, high heart rate, high blood pressure, temp goes up to 99.5 or so, feel like my throat gets so tight and I cant breathe, feels like food getting stuck in chest, upset stomach, cant eat literally for days at a time (I force myself and keep drinking water).        I have been told by several drs its anxiety but had a hard time accepting it because its so scary and dont want to deal with it forever.  I was prescribed a VERY small dose of beta blocker which i take 1/4 a pill and ativan for when it gets bad.  I was also prescribed aciphex for possible GERD.  The aciphex is working and the beta blocker is making my heart rate and bp low but it doesnt seem any of the other stuff is (breathing and throat tighening is CONSTANT and makes me feel like I cant eat).  I have been evaluated soooo many times, EKGs, blood tests, CTs, Xrays, scopes, barrium swallow and I could keep going on and everything looks great.  Im a 26 yr old female.  I feel now like I cant even work because I feel bound to my house because when I get in the car I start shaking and cant breathe.  This has been going on for 2 months now and I just NEED it to go away.        Has anyone experienced this and if so what can I do?? What works best OTHER then breathing, which I continue to try constantly.  My mom and aunt had this at about my age and it disappeared for both of them just as fast as it came.

20090306220413AAf9mES	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	TEN POINTS BEST ANSWER!!!! PLEASE HELP!!!?	Hey, I asked this question earlier, but wasn't happy with the results.      Ok, my friend and I (agent5643 was his name, you can look him up under my contacts) were building something in my garage today. To cut a long story short, he trips, and the right side of his belly cuts into a pocketknife. It went fairly deep in.(He's not very fat either.....I mean, he has muscle, but is more on the scrawny side if you know what I mean....p.s. we are both 14.) Anyway, he's at the hospital right now, but the doctors aren't telling me ANYTHING about his condition. So there are just a few things I want to know. DON'T SUGAR COAT IT!!! LET ME KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE!   1. If it hit the intestine, would the blood be bright red, or dark red?   2. Would the knife have green stuff on it?   3. Would he feel the pain, or would he be numb?   4. How long before he bleeds to death?   5. Would the intestine be able to start to creep out of the hole?      I'm guessing the pocketknife is about 1/4 of an inch wide.   Thanks...I'm really worried, please tell me the truth...somebody PLEASE!      WE weren't playing with knives, we were building something and were designing the wood by cutting designs in it. He stood up, tripped over a hammer, and fell.         P.S. How long will he probably be in the hospital for? (if it hit his intestine)

20090306222009AAIVNM3	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Effexor XR & Eczema - Why?	I am currently tapering off of Effexor XR.  I was previously taking 300mg/day and, starting June, have been slowly tapering.  I am now taking ~20mg/day.      Every time I reduce my Effexor dosage, my mouth becomes itchy, swollen, red, and dry.  I saw a dermatologist who said it was eczema, which I've had in other places before.  I'm currently treating the eczema with hydrocortisone ointment.      The dermatologist didn't really have an answer for what was causing the eczema, and couldn't tell me if it was the Effexor.      I doubt the eczema is caused by my toothpaste or makeup, b/c I use those daily...but I only have eczema for 1-5 days after I change my Effexor dosage.      The prescribing doctor...well, doctors...have been no help.  Every doctor I've had while I've been on this has told me that "no one has side effects from this medication" and that I "shouldn't be experiencing any problems."  The doctor who took me down from 300mg to 225 initially tried to take me all the way down to 150mg in one jump, but I found the "non-existent" side effects (brain zaps, nausea, irritability, agitation) inconsistent with my job.  If it were up to him I'd have only taken two weeks to come off of this, and I don't doubt that would have been a disaster.      Googling Effexor, withdrawal, and eczema does create a few hits.      But no one seems to know why, or really understand why I want to know why.      So, if you have any idea, I'd be interested in hearing it.  Speculation is fine with me.  This is mostly an academic curiosity...although my mouth would like to know.

I just couldn't see a doctor due to no insurance.      Today I had a pap smear (it was actually a pleasant experience) and the doctor asked if I had any questions and I told her how even though I had the BV treated like twice since 2006 it never went away and I was wondering what's going on down there.      Needless to say she was amazed that I knew I still had BV and she said its rare, but some women can suffer from BV for a very long time.      Could BV last 3 years even when it was treated? Oh and I got a prescription for MetroGel and the pills.
20090306225042AA3Etp0	Health;Diet & Fitness	Do you think that the Height and Weight tables for males and females are outdated?	I know these height and weight tables have been the norm since the 1950's and probably a few years before that. Now, if you look at people today, even athletes for that matter they are considered overweight based upon the chart. Like for instance A male is supposed to be weighing no more than 180 pounds at 5"9, if he's anything over 180 pounds then he's considered obese. I know of people 5"9 and weigh about 215 and are no where near obese, they're not muscular either but they don't look obese to me. So anyway, what do you think of the height and weight table made during sometime around 1950's or sooner. It's outdated? I know that men/women look a hell of a lot bigger than they did in the 50's and 60's, and so forth because for one thing all the hormones we pump in our food we eat, so of course we got bigger. We had no choice majority of our food was like this. The people from the 60's looked like twigs a lot of them did even the athletes as compared as of today's athletes. Look at Lebron James compared to Elgin Baylor, or Mike Tyson compared to Muhammed Ali. See what I mean? Shaquille O'Neal to Bill Russell, or Kareem Abdul Jabbar.
20090306234115AAtIJAL	Health;Women's Health	I REALLY need some advice. Can someone experienced give me some helpful advice. PLEASE. ITS URGENT!?	Ok, here’s the deal. I started exercising again (high intensity cardio) and after the second day of my workout, I went to the washroom and when I wiped I noticed a tiny bit of blood. I didn’t take it seriously because it wasn’t much and when I checked my pad the next morning, there was barely anything on it. When I went to the washroom the second day after my workout, I noticed a little more blood.    I found this weird because my period just had finished a week before. A little while later, I noticed that the area below my pelvis on the right side was slightly hurting and swollen. I thought this must be from exercising. Yesterday and Today, I didn’t do any exercise. Yesterday, it was still swollen and hurting a little bit, but there was no blood. Today, it’s still swollen and hurts a little. But there is no blood. It’s not as swollen as before, so I think it’s getting better, but it still slightly hurts. It’s not my pelvis, but the area below it…I don’t know what it’s called. I don’t think I broke my hymen because the day after I exercised I was bleeding a little bit and then it stopped overnight. The next day when I exercised, I was bleeding again. So, I know it’s from exercising. Now I’m not sure if I might have an ovarian cyst, but I don’t think so because my pelvis isn’t hurting, the area below it and its not excruciating pain or anything. It’s also less swollen than before, so I don’t think it’s that serious. Should I go to the doctor or not? BTW, I’m 19. I don’t know if I should take it seriously. If by tomorrow the pain is less and it’s not as swollen, do you think I should go or not?
20090307010207AAE84Wx	Health;Mental Health	Help! Loner guy needs some help! Can you help!?	Okay I'm really upset right now because of something that happened tonight. I was planning on going with these guys to see a really cool band in concert. I was really excited not only because this was going to be my first ever concert, but I was also hoping for the first time to make some friends out of the deal. Well, when the time finally came to go waited and waited for them to call me so they could come and pick me up. I'm sure you can guess what they did to me. They just left me waiting at my apartment for hours and never did they try to contact me about what was going on. I tried calling the number they gave me, but it turns out that it was just a number that is disconnected. It was 6:00 in the evening and the show was supposed to start and here I and sitting all alone. Then I received a text message that had one word "LOSER!." I thought I found some real friends! I thought I would finally get to go to a concert. BUT NO! I'm just here for no god given reason! Man I'm almost 20 years old and I still ha vent gone to a concert! I want to go to one so badly! I just don't think I ever will though. I'm so very depressed and so very angry! I though this was the moment when something good would happen. Oh how I yearn for friends, family, and concerts!       What can I do to calm myself down?

20090306231128AAAeJzh	Health;Women's Health	Questions for women who are against porn...?	I know this isn't really the right section but I know I'll get a bunch of answers here.      I often hear women talking about how porn gives men unrealistic expectations about women, distorts their perspective of women, et cetera. My question is this: do you think that guys expect car chases during their commutes, because they watch action movies? It seems like guys are smart enough to know the difference between a movie and real life.      I know that some guys get addicted to porn, but people can get addicted to anything; it's a matter of genetics largely. My cousin's father is an alcoholic, and my cousin was addicted to Sudafed (getting hit by a truck fixed his addiction.) Other people in that branch of the family have addiction problems. Just some semi-anecdotal evidence there.      Do most of the guys you've been with expect you to act like women in porn? I know my guy is happy with me the way I am (I'm only 16 so we're still virgins, but I don't look anything like your standard porn chick and my guy has stayed around for two years) but maybe he's just a minority.      And, last, just curious, have you ever watched porn? I watched a couple movies, but had to stop like thirty seconds in because it was just too goofy. Not saying you can't judge if you haven't watched porn, I'm just wondering.      Sorry this isn't that coherent, I have a chest cold keeping me up until 2:15 AM...

20090307001617AAFHd83	Health;Diet & Fitness	I need help losing weight and getting back to work.?	I am 24 almost 25. I have not had the best life. I really want to lose weight. I will do whatever it takes, short of getting surgery. I know it sounds like I'm lying but I do not have the first clue as to how to lose weight. I have learned to maintain my weight by slowing down on eating and trying to move around a little more when I see the scale go up at all, but I don't know how to actually lose it. I have tried diets and pills and those do not work. I guess I should tell you a little about me so maybe you can give me advice on the best things I can do personally. My mother never had a vehicle when I was going up, so we walked everywhere we had to go. My legs strong and only have fat in the top inner thighs. I got pregnant when I was 14. When I was 6 months pregnant, I was standing off a curb and a town bus came by and I got hit. Mostly in the left shoulder and I was spun in the bus' wheel and thrown some feet away. I gave birth when I was 15. (And no, I didn't even know what abortion was back then, let alone my mother would have forbid it). I started getting back pain when I was 15 and I went to the doctor. He said I had slight scoliosis in my back. He sent me for physical therapy where they did electronic muscle something w/hot towels, light exercises while on my back, and cardio stationary bicycle workouts (the one that has a seat). I lost about 35 lbs and felt great. When I was 17, I met my current boyfriend. We had some trouble between our families and ended up getting an apartment together when I was 18. The only place we could afford was away from anything I knew and I didn't have a license. He ended up telling me to stay home and he will work. When we have enough money, I can get a license. We have had a rough relationship over the next couple of years. When I turned 20, I worked at a restaurant and fell down the steps out back. I hit my lower back above my butt on my left side.Shortly after that, I got pregnant with my second baby. I delivered when I was 21. I finally got my license when I was 22 when I finally found someone that would take me for it. I smoked off an on since I was 16. Quitting isn't a problem. I am quit right now. I only start up again when I go to a bar in the summer (only happens maybe twice a summer and once a winter). But I can quit shortly after. I have a little obsessive complusiveness but weight is one thing I don't try to be a perfectionist on. Mostly because I don't know how. I have not worked for about five years. I know you are probably thinking what a loser and you can be right, but I can go on and on about how I messed up my life. I was a straight a student, very popular, and threw everything away. I quit school, I had a kid when I was way to young to even know what sex is, I have been with someone not good for me, and so on and so on. But I am asking for help. I want to start fixing my life and making it better so my kids can be proud of me. I want to be able to go out of the house without feeling sick. I sit home and I know I have to lose weight, and I know I have to start working. I do not have many friends. Any that have come in my life stab me in the back. I know I have depression. I have not had medical insurance for years. I have pain in my back and a lot in my neck. I do not sleep regularly. Now, to my body. I am 5'3". I weight 225 lbs. I have tighter legs. I have a small, very tight butt (if you know how to get a bigger butt, please let me know! gaining weight is sooo not how). I have a very large mid-section. I don't have really big arms. They seem to have stayed thin like I was before I got pregnant when I was 14. I have larger boobs (40d some bras 40dd). Please help me with any advice you have about a weight loss plan I can use. I was born with a pin-sized hole in my heart and tachycardia. I grew out of that when I was 3 1/2. I think I might have a blood pressure problem and I know if I don't eat I shake like I have a blood sugar problem. I am not making any excuses and will try any legitimate suggestions. I have a strong will and I hope to put it toward my goal.

20090307000019AAhQcGD	Health;Women's Health	Boob/Weight Loss Question?	My left breast is way larger than the other one, though its not noticeable to anyone else but me (and my doctor) really. They are both pretty large for my body type, but its mostly just fat. When I lose more weight (well on my way to doing so), my breasts will obviously shrink, but I'm afraid that my right one will shrink more  and make my chest even more uneven! I think this because my left breast has never seemed to feel right, and its riddled with scists (a common woman problem, mostly contributed by genetics). Has any one here experienced their breasts becoming more uneven after weight loss?

My now husband and I have been considering children well after trying for a year and no results I decided to go to Web Md and see if they can tell me anything.

My grandma was on life support today and earlier this week, and she was put on sedatives, and today, she was off of the sedatives. This time, she she wouldn't wake up for the nurses... for the daily commands, like she had done all last week, they said her brain was basically inactive and life support was sustaining her life. .. but today my mom, uncle, brother, and sister went there and talked to her and she responded by gesturing, Mom asked her " You want those tubes out Momma?" and she gestured by shaking her head "No". Mom told her it's ok to let go...  she gestured again "NO." She also opened her eyes and looked at us when we talked to her. Also her heart-rate went from the 60's to the 80's when we were talking to her. and so did her blood pressure. it went from 90's/ 40's.. to 100's / 60's. So I wonder if this is a sure sign that she knows we are there, and can hear us and is gettting excited. or if it is just something we go through when our bodies are shutting down. her gesturing has raised a lot of questions of whether or not she was ready, or was it just a response?

20090307000034AAaoUPs	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why I am losing muscle mass and definition.?	I know this is going to sound absurd but bear with me.  I workout Monday-Thursday.  I separate each day into body parts, doing each part once a week.  One day will be chest, the next bis/tris, legs/shoulder etc.  I have no specific day for any body part.  I just lift whatever I feel like on that day. I almost never do cardio becuase I have a tough time putting on weight.  I have always had a six pack and great muscle definition even before I began working out.  Last week I had my body fat tested and I was down to 4.3% on the digital machine while putting on 5 pounds.  The only problem is that I am losing muscle mass and definition.  My arms are smaller to the point where people are commenting.  My six pack has become almost unnoticeable.  I just can't comprehend what has happened over the last month or two for this drastic change to occur with my body.  I am 28, 5'10 and 161 pounds.  I have not changed my eating habits but I did begin taking Wheybolic protein shakes after my workout.  It has about 60 grams of protein in each shake.  Does anyone know why and how I would drop body fat, gain weight but lose mass and definition? Any suggestions on what to do.?

She now has a 13-month-old daughter and I'm worried about my niece. Ordinarily, she's well taken care of and thriving, but I know that when my sister is doing her thing, she ignores everything else.  What do I do? My niece isn't constantly suffering, but she's obviously in a place where smoking is taking place, and I wonder if her diaper's being changed, she's being forced to stay in her crib, what kind of people is my sister letting in, etc? And my niece's father has a history of abuse, too, and I assume he's doing it as well. Should I call CPS? I'm afraid my niece will be taken away when my Mom and I can care for her. Or, is there a way they'll mandate drug tests but let my niece stay with her mom? Please help, I feel sick to my stomach. Thanks.
20090307143011AATNrXZ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Is this possible..........?	A girl I work with told me a story about what happened to her close personal friend...and I was thinking to myself...can this REALLY happen?      Here's the story:      They all went out to Olive Garden the other night, and her friend ordered the cheese ravioli, since she is a vegetarian. Well, the waitress brought out the wrong order (it had red ravioli sauce on it) and the girl asked her to return it and bring the cheese ravioli.      Well a few minutes later the waitress brings out the ravioli but it has meat sauce, and since she's a vegetarian, she asked her to bring it back and AGAIN ask for the cheese ravioli.      So she's sitting there waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and after all of her friends were pretty much done eating, she FINALLY gets her cheese ravioli. She takes a few bites and tells the waitress to box it up for her, since all of her friends are done eating.      Well the next day (or maybe that night), she has trouble breathing and her throat was killing her. So she goes to the doctor and he tells her that it's herpes. She obviously was freaked out. The doctor asked her if she had oral sex or eaten anything recently that might have done that. She told him she had Olive Garden last night, and still had it boxed up. So the doctor tells her to bring it in to inspect it.       Doctor runs some tests and finds 3 traces of DNA, and an STD - HERPES. 3 guys in the back had jerked off into her ravioli.

20090307142147AAzNrYV	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Does anyone know what this rash is?	My friend has round red blotches on her legs which almost look like lyme disease except there aren't any 'bullseyes' in the center. Just circles which are red and discolored around them, and then there is nothing in the middle. They are just circular red marks on her lower legs. She says that they do not bother her at all, but they are very visible and strange looking. There are no bumps and no raised skin, just the rash.       Has anyone heard of anything like this? We do not know what to search for on google. She is going to the doctor within a few days but for now her mother is looking for what it could potentially be.

20090307141210AA1YCPK	Health;Mental Health	Panic attack sufferers. Help?	So this is kind of long,  I really appreciate anyone who wants to read it or give me some feedback :)      I have always had alot of anxiety and stuff, mostly around new people, my school, and big crowds.  I used to have what I'd call "panic attacks" when I was a heavy pot smoker.  I hated feeling stoned, but I was addicted and used it to escape.  As soon as I lit up, I felt the panic attack until I burnt out.        I've quit smoking ganja 10 months or so ago, and since then, I haven't had a full blown panic attack....      Until last night.      I was sitting in a movie theatre, and I had already been feeling 'off' that night.  I was slightly nervous (due to having a stressful week), but had calmed down. Until halfway through the movie, I started to feel really overheated, my heart started pounding, I started to tremble, my muscles started to ache.  I felt like I was going to have a heart attack.  I wanted to get up and go to the bathroom to chill out for a minute, but I literally was too scared to even move.  It lasted until the end of the movie (I couldn't wait for it to be over) and then the anxiety kind of died off an hour or so later.      WTF?!  How can I deal in these situations?  It really scared me last night, because I am nearing the end of a break from school, and I'm starting to question if I should even go back.  I just want to feel normal and calm.  Why does this happen?

20090307140917AAi5XTx	Health;Mental Health	Im 17 feel so lonely and bored please help?	Im a 17 year old guy. Now to start with, my life isn't bad by any means, I have some good friends even though I don't see any of them very often, I can talk to my family about some things, I live in a nice flat, am doing well in my studies, and have all my health. However, at the moment I am just feeling so unsure about what I want, and who I am, Im jealous of other peoples lives and keep asking myself what they're doing right that I'm not, I'd really like more regular reliable friends who i could go out alot more with but am worried it will never happen. I feel so lonely and bored and isolated sitting at home staring at a pc screen and it feels like a vicious cycle because you make friends by talking about things you do and being interesting and most of the time I do nothing or very little worth talking about. And before you say get involved with something honestly I dont have time with the huge amount of homework and revision on my hands.   Is this feeling familiar? Does it go over time?   Reassurance/advice needed   thanks

20090307135639AAlTwGH	Health;Mental Health	Am I clinically depressed?	Lately, I've had these random bouts of sadness.  Until last night, these negative feelings were usually really nothing more than "the blues".  They were fleeting, too, so it was easy to smother.      Last night, I freaked out over a very trivial thing that shouldn't have upset me so much.  (But what I freaked out about isn’t really relevant.)  I had a panic attack and I was bawling, which I haven't done in a long, long time.  I started getting really self-deprecating, thinking that I haven't done anything meaningful in my life and that everything I do happen to do is worthless.  And then I started thinking about how ******* lonely I am, which was really hard to admit to myself, because I liked deluding myself into thinking that I could live without any friends because I'm independent.  Well, I guess I'm not.  Now, I have no friends because I’ve pushed away everyone, save for my family, that ever really cared.  I really regret that, but I  know can't fix it.      I'm really socially awkward.  I don't know how to go about making a friend or even keeping a conversation going.  It's hard to even meet people because I'm home schooled.      I just feel so royally ******.  I feel trapped in these barriers that I've built around myself to keep people out.  Now that I want to let people in, it's too late.  I don't know what to do.  I feel helpless.  I'm tired all the time and I only get myself some food if it feels like my stomach is literally eating itself.  Doing obligatory things for myself is like a chore.  Keeping my mind and body healthy seems not only impossible, but not worth trying.      Am I depressed? Like, clinically depressed? I'm already on Sertraline (Zoloft) and I have Xanax to help me get through panic attacks, but it just isn't working like it used to.  I hate feeling dependent on anything, so I don't want to increase my dosage.      I really hate feeling this way.  What can I do?

I haven't really exercised for a couple weeks (about 2-3 weeks) until Thursday when I started softball at my school. We didn't run or anything. We just did throwing and catching and ground balls, but the thing was that we didn't stretch our legs out before so I think that probably had some effect. After practice though, my hamstring/groin area started to hurt and when I walked I was limping quite a bit. It still hurts when I walk and when I try to stretch it out. I was thinking that possibly I pulled a muscle or something but I'm not sure.      so if you know, please let me know what I can do to help it heal faster b/c we have practice next week and then on Saturday I'm going to costa rica for a school trip and we'll be doing a lot of walking. so please let me know asap!      thanx a ton. best answer gets 10 points

20090307131119AA6gPM0	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	I have some questions about Minnesota care health insurance?	My husband and I got kicked off the free program about a month and a half ago because my husband makes to much. The insurance through my husbands company is 1500 a month for all 3 of us and its still 500 for just my husband. So there is no way we can afford that. I just got our letter today regarding Minnesota care and im eligible because im a SAHM but it says my husbands isnt because his employer pays more then 50% of health insurance premiums. My question is do they take in to consideration the fact that the insurance through my husbands work would be 500 dollars a month. Im also 8 weeks pregnant with number 2 so I cant not have insurance. We dont mind paying for our insurance but we can not afford what his work is asking him to pay. Im wondering if anyone has any options for my husband not having insurance or is that just the way its going to be. Hes not on any medication and he has gone to the doctors 3 times in the past 2 years ( twice for a flue shot and once for something else), I would liek something just in case something happens. I just need some advice on what to do. Thank you.

The old doctor wrote out his scripts monthly and saw him every 2 months. Now he has a medical insurance change and can no longer see this doctor. Hes been off the medication for about a month now ( After going through with drawls) Which was almost unbearable for me, but he needs them. The new Teacher is personally REQUESTING that he gets help. Hes an A+ student. But his behavioral issues from lack of concentration are severely starting to affect his grades once again. The new doctor will not even see him for this condition instead wants to restart the entire eval process, which could take months. Is there anyway I can get him back on his meds sooner?

Yes, I posted this question MANY times, but I am scared, if you understand and would like to help..please read on.         Ok so this happened on Thursday, I was working on my science project with my friend, and this kid in our class cut himself on something, he ran to me and wiped in on my shirt hood, then he wiped some on my friend's sweater arm. Now i always lightly hit her with the back of my hand to get her attention or something you know? And have scabs, and possible open wounds on my hands that touched that blood on her sweater from the guy.HIV! Next off, some were covered with band-aids but all moist under there, so with the blood on my sweater and washing my hands(not changing the wet band-aids after the wash, allowing hiv to pass..) also the blood might have gotten on my hands(probably did) and i ate lunch anyways with CUTS on my mouth, and in my mouth(lunch was an after hour this though!)      He said he goes out with a lot of girls and he does, makes out and what ever, he said he lost his virginity! What if he has HIV and passes it on!Hes good friends with all my friends, why am i scared!         I am gonna wait 3 months and get tested, but my mom wont take me she thinks i don't have HIV or couldn't have gotten, even if the blood was in my cuts he probably didn't have HIV   Also about 1 year ago , about 8 months i got gum stuck to my pants from a movie theater seat, eating afterwards without washing my hands, with wounds on my mouth(bulimia tends to do that to me..) SO what if i ahve gotten AIDS from that!?      So what if i do have HIV!?      Im only 13, i never kissed a boy, "went out" did drugs, why do I deserve this, im a good student im nice!!

20090307112654AAbPDjC	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Ignoring me cause of Cancer!?	In mid January I found out I have testicular cancer. Had the surgery, been going through chemo, all that great stuff! Well my g/f found out, took it hard but everything was ok. But for the past week she's ignored me completely! Won';t call, come by and the last time I saw her she could hardly look at me. Her mother tells me it's cause she's not handling it good at all. I can kind of understand that cause her mother's had cancer and she lost her grandmother to cancer when she was 18. Her mom is also saying that she can't look at me cause she'll break down and that's the last thing I need cause it'll upset me. What the hell!!? So ignoring me is going to make all of this **** go away huh? We've been together for five-years but this is really starting to upset me! Is this a normal reaction for some people? In my opinion she's running away from me over something I have NO control over! After all of this I'm definitely not telling her that the cancer has spread! That would be the end of us if she's already ignoring me.

The itch does not feel like its on my skin, but feels like its under my skin perhaps caused by a nerve. My feet have pronated inwards for all my life and my doctor said that a nerve in my foot was being stretched and irritated causing the itch, so he recommended sub-taylor implants for my feet. I had the surgery about two years ago and still there is no relief of the itch (however the surgery did stop my knee pain). the spot where it itches (about the size of a quarter) gets completely numb when i itch it (i think because i itch it so hard), and sometimes blisters. the skin is also very hard and callused. It will itch several times a day and i have to use sharp objects to get releif. itch relievers for the skin never work, and i have to use sharp objects to itch it. ive even itched it so hard ive gotten cut pretty deep..however i didnt bleed.      WHY IS THIS!?..im so tired of it

20090307143718AA2j9aL	Health;Mental Health	Anyone know anything about memory loss?	I am 16 and I seem to have a short term memory loss problem with numbers. For example, last year my teacher posted our grades on the bullentin board. I would go up to the board read it but by the time I got back to my seat I had completely forgot what the number was and I often had to go back and check. This especially becomes a problem when I'm counting things because I ALWAYS lose track.      Any information on this?    Besides this, I do often forget little things more often than other people such as what classes I have today, and when people ask me what I did yesterday or a few days ago I have a lot of trouble actually recalling it. Sometimes I will completely have no recollection of what I did the previous weekend.   But my long term memory is great. People are astonished at how much I can remember from when I was little.      Any information?   Thanks!      And no, I don't do drugs or drink a lot of alcohol.
20090307145734AAaJkCt	Health;Mental Health	Bi-polar disorder Information?	I'm afraid that I have bi-polar disorder. My whole life has been kinda crazy and because of growing up with so much tension(abusive father to mother, drug addict brother, alcoholic mother, just over all CRAZY life) I have developed a really bad anger problem. When I was younger(kindegarten) I even took it out on my teachers(actually physically hurting them) but as I got older I got control of myself and now I have serious anger issues toward my mother. I let a lot of things roll off my back, but when I'm talking to my mom I always get really stressed and sometimes if gets too much and I just burst. This fall I threw something at her and attacked her and my brother called the cops on me.       Anyways, my emotions are crazy. I don't have anyone to really help me with them. When I was younger(middle school, early high school) I would just get angry and cry a lot. Last spring after the one person I really had joined the military something just happened. I stopped crying. Even the day my dog died I didn't cry and I just moved on with my day. Which is soo unlike me because I loved that dog and grew up with her and spent so much time with her. But it just seemed that I became a emotionless blob and I was faking happy a lot. Then this fall I moved far away from the town I lived in for ten years and left all of my friends and everything I knew behind. Now I am pretty much lost and lonely.       TO GET TO THE POINT..lol. Lately I've had very bad anger outbursts, which happen just very suddenly. Like one minute I'm laughing and the next I can't even control myself and it's not even me at all. And then the next second I'm laughing. And sometimes I'm dancing around happy and then I'm suddenly crying. It's weird. But my emotions will change rapidly for no reason and there's nothing I can do about it. And a few months ago I tried to kill myself and it was weird because I was smiling while I did it. I know it sounds weird and all but if you met me then you'd never even know I was like this.      Also I am not one of those people who through around the idea that I might have Bipolar, I know at least 3 people that have it(all friends of mine) and my precious counselour believed my grandma and possibly mom have it.      Anyone have anything to say?   xxx

20090307144432AAYzkNq	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Changes in my skincare regimen, sublock, exfoliater, anti-biotics... help PLEASE!!?	Ok, so I have severe acne, whiteheads all over from my forehead to my neck and chest, to my back and shoulders.    Sorry to be gross but it's the truth.   It has been a problem for me since fourh grade and I am now a sophomore in high school.   Finally I went to my dermatologist because I have tried everything such as:   -Proactive   -Clean and Clear   -Neutrogena   -Proactive Gentle Formula   -SensiClear   -Clearisil Ultra, and many others.   So I was prescribed two treatments, one is an atibiotic, menacycline, and the other is a topical treatment tretinoin.   They are known to cause severe skin sensitivity and dryness. So my dermatologist recomended a sunblock. Also she recomended the neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash. So I need to drastically change my skincare regimen.      Here is my current regimen:   - Proactive Gentle Formula Facial Scrub   - Proactive Gentle Formula Toner   - Proactive Gentle Formula Night and Day Lotion   And on occassion when I get dry   - Proactive Green Tea Moisturizer      I hae extremely oily skin but these products are known to cause severe dryness and sunburns, so this is what I have to add to my regimen:      - Oil Free SPF 15 sunblock   - Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash   - Tretinoin (topical cream)   - Menacycline (antibiotic)      Now I am supposed to take the Menacycline twice a day, and apply the Tretinoin at night before bed.   I still want to exfoliate every once in a while or maybe every night, idk.   My dermatologist said to use a face wash with Salicylic Acid which both my current Cleanser and my new Neutrogena Acne Wash have. So idk if I should use my Proactive scrub at night or buy something new or what. Idk when to use these new things, should I still use the toner and lotions? I really don't know what to do.    Help, Please and Thank You.

20090307143601AAJyfYH	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Should I still have this pain, one year after my dislocation?	So back in May of 2008, I was bouldering (rock climbing without a harness on a low wall) and I fell fifteen feet, caught my arm on a hold and dislocated my elbow. X-rays in the ER revealed that I had fractured a piece of my ulna off the tip of the bone and it was floating around in my joint (the reduction went just as planned, however). They were somewhat worried and referred me to an orthopedic surgeon where a CT scan revealed I had nothing to worry about.      I went through about six weeks of physical therapy and regained full range of motion back. No pain, and everything was great until about two days ago.      I was laying on the couch watching a movie and got up when I was done. I found that I couldn't straighten my arm all the way and it was just as painful as when I first began to move my arm after it was immobilized for five weeks. It scared me, but after a couple minutes it went away and I pushed it out of my head as I had just laid on it wrong.      However, that night it did the same thing once more, and yesterday did it more than dozen times. I would get the same thing however, it would go away and my arm would just be left sore but not necessarily hurting like it had.      Is there a possibility that the bone fragment could be coming back and impairing my range of motion? Or is this just what arthritis feels like (like they had warned me I would get)? (I'm only seventeen) Is it just my tendons being stiff, I guess? And should I get this checked out by my orthopedic surgeon?
