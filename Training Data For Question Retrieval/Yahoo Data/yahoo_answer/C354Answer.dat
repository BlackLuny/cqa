WdhAEQZwaa	OMG i love the all american rejects. They are my favourite band....and you like them too so HIGH FIVE!!! [[insert high five]]. My fave song is every single song by AAR. I cant choos between any two of their songs. I love them all so much. i like how to save a life as well. but i like "you found me"- by the fray better than how to save a life. AAR 4eva... woooooo!!|`|oLwnm3Npaa	Hmm?, mine would probably be Soul Meets Body by Death Cab 4 Cutie, it's a totally awesome song :)|`|RFCcWPliaa	right now it's: leave yourself for somebody else by phantom planet and the market by the hush sound. but it changes every few minutes/hours. listen to them, they're really good. sort of alternative-rock. not like all time low or the maine or that stuff.|`|SYYO3oozaa	For some reason the first song that popped into my head is "The Freshman" by The Verve Pipe.

I define hooking up as sex or close to. moral and legal reasons aside a 17 or 18 year old is too immature. Plus I do not hook up with gals that quickly, I am a bit more old fasioned...But you are a good looking young lady :)|`|S2tBYhCKaa	No.  I'd prefer ladies who enjoy speleological pursuits;  great minds think alike.  Hookup in speleology is when we use 'biners to clip ascent or  descent apparatus to our waist harness for 11mm sheathed  kernmantle applications.  Ever notice how some folks can't think outside their box?|`|MzqZGvalaa	I'm a straight female, and yeah, I'd have a go at you, you're pretty hot, and I've not had much luck with men - how about it babeee?

ibhJgDmUaa	Lmao I hate those. And those quiz ones and they're like, "Which is by Sony? Playstation 3 or Xbox 360. Text your answer to this number and win an iPod" or something. Then it costs like $1 for the first text. And at the bottom in barely readable text it says, 'each minute on this service costs 20 cents'. I admit. I was stupid enough to do one of those, just cause I was like 'damn this quiz looks easy peasy'.

I just got back from the basketball quad.    A quad, if you were unaware, is when two schools have their JV Girls, JV Boys, Varsity Girls, and varsity Boys Teams play against each other.    ITS INTENSE!    My oh my though, it is so much fun. And theres so much excitement, and my school has so much SPIRIT! I love it.    And so the schedule was:    JV Gals, JV Guys, Varsity Girlies, and finally Varsity Men.    JV Girls was pretty intense, all my friends are BEASTS on the court. Ahah, its wonderful. There were a few girls who I now have some MAJOR RESPECT for, I mean really, it was ridiculous. I was expecting little fragile twigs with legs, I got shy quiet gals giving their all into this one game. And it didnt even matter that they lost, ok. :D    JV Boys was absolutely amazing though. It was so much smoother, but when those guys got into it and mainly with fouls, they were just crazy. I was so shocked to see that everyone on the team was someone who I once grew up with and was best friends with. It was so mad to look at them and see them play, and get all nostalgic while thinking about how so and so on the team was your first crush, and how so and so who got that last rebound was the first boy who ever asked you to dance at a boy AND girl party.    I mean its just ridiculously sad, but also makes you feel so blessed that you knew these guys (and some girls from the team) when they were a little younger and quite possibly, better people.    And soon enough, I started feeling pretty bad, and rather sentimental over it.    So now Im just thinking about that childhood o mine, but mainly the people from it.    Ive always been an advocate for change, but looking back, maybe change kind of killed things for me.    SO HERES MY NEW GOAL:    To re-establish ties with all those boys who were the bestest friends the tom-boy sixth-grade version of me could have ever asked for. ESPECIALLY the first crush one and the first May I have this dance? one. Just because they still stick out to me and were the first people I thought of when I started yearning for my past.|`|aXqi9lYJaa	I'm at home, because I am sick.!

MfqHFQwbaa	I think animation companies like FUNamation and VIZ find great voice actors for their shows. But there comes a time when sometimes...they aren't so good.

Who was the company for them?)|`|ZIMmGqEAaa	I hated when One Piece got dubbed with different people later on into the series.

You should ask the troll why he is in your bath tub.  What does your troll look like?  My first encounter with a troll was when i was a young padawon.  It was a green troll with bright pink hair.  I hope it's not an aggressive troll...........trust me you need to become a Jedi.|`|8SbgHDqfaa	Try pouring some shampoos,conditioners,hand soap,perfume and cleaning products onto it.|`|0eadf4e16863936d9a671a93e35b8840aa	eat it.  it wants to be eaten.  if it didn't want to be eaten it would be in your kichen. and if it goes to your kitchen drown it.  if it's anywhere else it either likes life or is trying to find either the bathroom or the kitchen.  but (and i am speaking from experience here) to my knowledge..... most trolls spend the majority of their miserable lives trying to commit suicide in the only two ways they know how (which i have already explained to you)    hope i helped!!   =]......ME!!!!!|`|SqGO6Qyeaa	buy him a ticket to argentina. convince him that the best looking grass is in argentina. trolls love grass. once he's in argentina hack into the US government's system and change his citizenship to canadian. then when he returns to canada, because he is now convinced it is his home he will have better health care than you.     happy troll hunting.|`|lrrrStfCaa	eat it|`|DiF4GulPaa	who is it. your mom!!! jk um cut a hole in the roof over the bath tub so hell melt|`|8UBYsoBEaa	tell him that theres a nice bridge outside with a view|`|FliUPdJOaa	kiss it and it will turn to a prince|`|mIM8UWidaa	I think you should upt a spell on it and turn it into a house elf, like Dobby!|`|K4GiKOhPaa	Get him his own rubber ducky.|`|XXbINMWzaa	It loves to eat soap.

Second go to a alliance major city stack up on potions scrolls and bandages from the auction house. Third plan a strategy with your members to defeat the troll then attack.

Maybe they think all that fair-play, wanting harmonious interactions, thinking about others as much as ourselves is just a big act.        Libra moon|`|KbxlH2lFaa	You are not a LIBRA.I am not even dignifying this answer by writing anymore(FULL STOP).|`|qnBVKBJIaa	I'm a Libra and when I was growing up, some people was mean to me.

I mean, really.|`|4UeOIGuhaa	everyone is mean to every sign. Don't let it get to you.|`|os6FaEBlaa	I'm a Libra, and I get along with everyone because I'm so chill, I like to balance everything out, but the fault about loving everyone is that alot of Libra girls are whores. Or at least everyone I met is.    -Examples:    First Libra girl I met, she dated me, and ended up f*cking one of my friends.    Second, dated my friend, ended up calling me in the middle of the night and I ended up seeing her at her cousins house, she ended up making out with me, I had to pay for that when I told my friend.

x7iYis9Saa	Yes I'll have some very rich Grandsons|`|a8UX1tHLaa	Well, I would never want to be secret service under Obama. I would probably not take a bullet for him. But then again, I would never be in that position, no matter what sum of money. Sorry. I do not like the guy much. Well, I can't stand him. The only one I would take a bullet for is Reagan, were he alive.|`|2liwk8yKaa	Never, never , never|`|Cfw5YrSvaa	Whats the point if ur dieing?|`|u1V8PCxcaa	No, I'd be dead then!; money's no use when your dead!|`|AA10214276	I don't think they're doing it for money. I'm sure they don't get paid more than the president does.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	The Secret Service that protect the president are highly trained, highly skilled individuals who are handpicked after a full year of screening and then undgo extensive training. They know what they are up against and they are supported by an extensive team that go to any lengths to reduce risk. In other words, while these individuals are indeed willing to die to protect the president, they understand too that the risk is as controlled as possible.    With Obama as hated already as he is, the security around him for a two-mile radius is intense. While the Secret Service is duty bound to protect him, it is highly unlikely that it will come to that.     This does not mean that these people are willing to die of the price is right. That is the sort of mentality suicide bombers have: pay me enough and I'll sacrifice my life.    The people who protect the president understand the mission and understand that they are part of an incredibly elite team.    When you come down to it, anyone in the military and/or the Secret Service is willing to lay down his/her life. And it's not about money. It's about honor and devoting one's life to something one believes in.|`|RX77mLdTaa	the president    taking a bullet for a higher cause--for society  without the president, there would be no order  it's like serving the army, for your country|`|F0q3gi5Gaa	probally not, i wouldent have the balz to.    if it was family or friend then probally|`|CxyXgoA5aa	If the person was worth it, then yes. Not for the money though, I'd protect anyone if they're important to me.|`|AA10106538	what good is the money , if you are dead|`|nXUV9lH1aa	uh no?|`|GJbziTG2aa	They wear bullet proof jackets. If they were going to point it anywhere on the jacket, then yeah. Plus I'll get a promotion and a medal and my name would be all over the news.|`|KAiHiHkGaa	I'd like to think i'd do it even for no money.|`|fESoEbgzaa	yeah but those secret service men have protection, bullet proof vest, etc  they are usually the top miltary men, so they are proplery trained  and get paid heaps|`|0Z2aBH0Daa	Yes. yes yes. If I signed up for that job, I would die to protect someone.    We have a friend who's in the secret service. His wife is in the FBI. No joke. It's his job to protect the president. I'm not sure if he's assigned to Obama right now but he was protecting Bush...|`|vECL7f9uaa	No of course not, if u get paid and died, then u can use the money  -bullets dont always kill  -most secret service dont end up taking a bullet for a president|`|aMBAb7lyaa	I rather clean toilets at mcdonalds, than protecting someone that means nothing to me..    Why do I have to put someone elses life, EVEN if it is the president of the United states over my own life???    I would only do it for someone that I trully love..|`|QCRgQrHAaa	hell ******* no.|`|3NdBYdlOaa	wow I've never thought about it that way,thats intresting,but I'm not sure if I would be strong enough to make that kind of  commitment|`|1iXvphNYaa	Its not like theyre just there waiting to be shot at. They get paid well to protect him meaning they have to a very good job of securing the perimeter of wherever hes going to be meaning less chances of having to worry about taking a bullet for him.|`|ZGMsI5ykaa	NO! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!? You are sick! That is disgusting! Anyways you wouldn't enjoy the money if you were dead! That is just wrong and evil and disgusting! You are mental!! Please go to a mental institution!|`|W1UHwwsoaa	No... I would not take a bullet for money. I do not know one person that im  not related to where I would take a bullet for them.|`|pUArocI5aa	Ummm, I just skimmed through, but, don't dis Obama. (Lol I hate reading)      And um, no?|`|7a68192d6e605ad9c0d1ad60daa6de4faa	no|`|n5faM4RVaa	Yes I would. It's my job as a soldier. And it's also the secret services job too, to protect Obama. When that is your job you place everyone life before yours. It's just the way people think some people think that's a stupid job, but others feel great and are glad about what they do.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	It is their job. They are trained for it and accept that it can happen but of course will do their best not to have it happen. Most people in the military have to come to grips with the fact that they could die. Heck everyone should come to grips with it because we are all in the same boat there. Nobody knows when their time is up and people die every day that didn't know they would and didn't think they could. Bodyguards are highly trained professionals who know what they are signing up for and are paid accordingly. Actually many people have died for others and not been paid for it. They are the ones called heroes. His bodyguards are proud to be in the position they are...it means they are the best at what they do and they take pride in that. Nobody wants to die but there are worse ways to go than to die for something you believe in.|`|v3Y33SaTaa	hell no bro dont die you kant take dat money 2 hell or heaven|`|hJ8q7PF2aa	Its all in with serving your country... just like the military.  Thousands of soldiers are shipped overseas in a terrorist infested country and risk their lives everyday because its their job.  I think the secret service gets a crap load of money for protecting the president.      Reasonable? Yes.  Would I do it? No, because thats just me

GNtWomekaa	 There was a blonde called Sally.   Sally was poor, and decided that she wanted to win the lottery.  So one night, she got down on her knees and prayed for a win.  The next day nothing happened.  The next night she prayed again. This time, god spoke to her and said "Sally, work with me here, buy a ticket!!!"       3 blondes were stuck in an elevator, the phones didn't work either.   1 blonde said to the other 2, "I think the only way to get help is by shouting together, okay?"  So they all shouted, "together, together, together!"       One morning a blonde stormed out of her house, went to her mailbox, opened it, then slammed it shut. She did this several times.   Finally, her neighbour asked, "are you ok?"  The blonde replied, "No! My stupid computer keeps saying, 'you've got mail'"       John came home one day to find his wife painting. She was sweating, wearing a ski jacket and a fur coat at the same time.  "Why are you wearing that?" he asked.  His wife replied, "The paint instructions says, 'for best results put on 2 coats'"       - I Took scarfe back to store, it was too tight.  - I Tried to go water skiing, but couldn't find a lake with slope.  - Baked turkey for 4 & 1/2 days.

Drink anytime.        Help me out. Check out my profile and answer my questions.|`|un1Ltnvdaa	It would depend on how late you are planning to stay out and how much drinking is planned.     If your plan is to get downright wasted then it doesn't really matter when you start.     If you hope to enjoy the evening buzzing around, allow time between drinks and drink to your limit. If your limit is 4 drinks, space them out every hour for four hours. So if you plan on ending your evening around 10PM start drinking at 5:30PM. Slowly eating light snacks and conversing between drinks can help time your consumption.         I personally start drinking with a light snack the moment I walk in the door after work; then slowly prepare diner. As a rule on the weekends I won't start drinking until after 12PM|`|OpduZC3Eaa	umm.. I say that everyone of all ages should drink whenever they're thirsty.

ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	oh yes...I'm so sick of him and his yelling.  It got old for me a long time ago.  Top Chef is good, though.  I'm a Keller fanatic, so I'd love to see some behind the scenes at his places (French Laundry, Per Se, etc).|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	I stopped watching him ages ago - the swearing is bad enough,  but i don't like the way he speaks to people, he's so rude -- i mean do people actually allow him to speak to them that way?!    I recognise he's a world-class chef, and well done to him for such an achievement - but i think he enjoys shocking people....     Brian Turner is good, but i love AWT - he's got a great sense of humour and used to always set something on fire on Ready Steady Cook LOL - it was hilarious..|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	No I love Gordon for all wrong reasons wink|`|fcPmf52raa	I think hells kitchen is hilarious so no|`|GCuGDMZraa	we have to wonder.. would ramsay reached this level of fame if he was just all about the cooking......?

There isn't a sentence without a bad word in it!!! Also he should only invite people whonare professional chefs not a teacher who isn't certified and someone who works at a cafeteriia that's just stupid!!    Anywho    If they could like have better attitudes I think I would and others would like the show more.|`|AA12336927	I don't know, I like him. You have to realize ( even if cameras weren't on him) this is his livelihood and his reputation at stake. If I'm not wrong, he is a perfectionist. Its entertainment ( sorta like the Roman arenas) but this is how he pays the bills. Kudos to him, sometimes you have to kick the whiners in the rear to get them to move it|`|8Y583Fluaa	he should watch the cursing|`|EotE5t56aa	Yea,im no prude but his language is getting past a joke now!  There are plenty of chefs out there who dont get all worked up just cos the camera is on them!!|`|B1GjfOUdaa	If Gordon complimented me on my cooking and kitchen I would be overjoyed.

He's a world class chef and has made good.    He didn't have a pot to piss in when he was a kid and has got where he is now through hard work. Good luck to him.    People seem to hate success in this country.|`|oJ0p2Ietaa	good idea i am fed up hearing the f word, i`m not that easily offended but it seems to be getting worse, and lets be honest there really is no need for it there are plenty of chefs that are as good if not better|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	aww i think he's great at what he does .and obviously c4 do too lol|`|QMYNDtHgaa	I also like Hell's kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares (the American and Foreign version) Ramsey is just trying to help these people reach full potential in his shouting cursing ratings grabbing way.

Read the Bible and you will never dount this religion. Scientists STILL can't prove us wrong.

MXpW48lFaa	I know right,  It's getting pretty annoying know.  Disney Stars aren't stupid or gay.  Someone said in a question once  that if The Jonas Brothers weren't Disney,  They'd like them,  But really wtf?  There just saying Disney sucks because  It's different or It's got sl*tty people on there,  like Miley Cyrus, but hey that was in the past.  They should get over it.  && Then there like,  Disney used to be kool,  now it's got lame shows and stuff.  Well whatever to them,  I like Disney,  && It is going to have changes,  it's 2009.  so yeahhh, HAAAA to the haters!

Most people just don't see the appeal. Take high school musical for example. I've been out of high school for a while now, but when I was there the groups of kids that randomly broke into musical numbers usually got their asses kicked. I'm pretty sure that hasn't changed.|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	Because they're bred to entertain, that is their main interest. Intelligence has nothing to do with their job. Why would they wish to be a straight A's student to get a job making 100k a year when they can be making 10 million a year singing and dancing? By the time they reach adulthood they can do whatever they want, such as going to the most expensive college on the planet and have private tutoring from the best minds money can buy.  In a way, they're not stupid, they're simply in a level of the game completely separate from yours.|`|bCTPG8Luaa	who watches disney channel that's over ten years old?|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	Because they are.

P4pWlWoiaa	In the Rastafari movement, "Zion" stands for a Utopian place of unity, peace and freedom, as opposed to "Babylon," the oppressing and exploiting system of the western world and a place of evil.    For Rastafarians, Zion is to be found in Africa, and more specifically in Ethiopia, where the term is also in use. Some Rastas believe themselves to represent the real Children of Israel in modern times, and their goal is to repatriate to Africa, or to Zion. Rasta reggae is peppered with references to Zion; among the best-known examples are the Bob Marley songs '"Zion Train," "Iron Lion Zion," and the Damian Marley song featuring Nas; "Road to Zion."    Pull up the lyrics too, you can better understand what he is talking about if you can read it. Damian and Nas both talk about a corrupt and harsh reality and how we must move towards good no matter what obstacles stand in the way. Excellent topic too by the way!|`|b9MqilAtaa	There are powerful lyrics within this song. Damian talks about the world being full of jealousy and calamity. Nas shows his eloquence with his verse, talking about what he sees today and what he saw in his past.    The song contains a sample from "Russian Lullaby" by Ella Fitzgerald.    Here's the lyrics...      "Road To Zion"  (feat. Nas)    Yeah Man...  Jah will be waiting there, We a shout!  Jah will be waiting there    [Verse 1]  In this world of calamity  Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy  And police weh abuse dem authority  Media clowns weh nuh know 'bout variety  Boom!    The youngest veteran a go murder dem slow  Ragga muffin sent to call me from the bush bungalow  Unnu watch mek I clear out my voice now Figaro!  Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow  Mi hammer dem a slam and spectator get low  Some bwoy coulda big like Bam Bam Biggalow  Bust of trigger finger, trigger hand and trigger toe  A two gun mi have mi bust dem inna stereo   Cause    [Hook]  I got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man  We gots to keeps it burning on the road to Zion, man    [Chorus 1]  Clean and pure meditation without a doubt  Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out  Jah will be waiting there we a shout  Jah will be waiting there!  In this world of calamity  Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy  And police weh abuse dem authority  Media clowns weh nuh know bout variety  Single parents weh need some charity  Youths weh need some love and prosperity  Instead of broken dreams and tragedy  By any plan and any means and strategy    [Hook]  Say!  We got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man   (Nas: I've been waiting to do this track with you man! Yeah...ha ha)  (Yeah, yeah)  You know (They know)  We got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man  (Yeah you gotta keep walking y'all,  You gotta keep...)    [Nas]  Sometimes I can't help but feel helpless   I'm havin daymares in daytime   Wide awake try to relate   This can't be happenin like I'm in a dream while I'm walkin   Cause what I'm seein is haunting  Human beings like ghost and zombies  President Mugabe holding guns to innocent bodies  In Zimbabwe  They make John Pope seem Godly  Sacrilegious and blasphemous    In my lifetime I look back at paths i've walked  Where savages fought and pastors taught   Prostitutes stomp in high heel boots   And badges screaming,"Young black children stop or I will shoot!"  I look back at cooked crack   Plus cars that pass by  Jaguars mad fly  And I'm guilty for materialism   Blacks is still up in the prison Trust that   So save me your sorries, I'm raising an army   Revolutionary warfare with Damian Marley   We sparkin' the ions, marching to Zion   You know how Nas be NYC state of mind I'm in     [Verse 1 Repeats]    [Hook]  I got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man  We gots to keeps it burning on the road to Zion, man    Clean and pure meditation without a doubt  Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out  Jah will be waiting there we a shout  Jah will be waiting there!

X45rxI7gaa	Super Vegito may not put much effort but even so he has the most dangerous moves of all DB characters! He's so badass he can kill anyone in just 5 seconds without looking    I believe he is as strong if not stronger than SS4 Gogeta for the following reasons    -Vegito basic mode is stronger than SS3 Goku = SS4 level in basic mode  -Earrings fusion is more powerful especially since Goku and Vegeta were rivals  -SS Vegito is SS4 x2 = SS4 Gogeta (again SS4 x 2)    that being the case it all depends on who's smarter....Vegito in this case, so he'd cream SS4 Gogeta if they went up against each other.|`|xxQ5QEqOaa	Mine is Super Dragon Fist    It's Goku's finishing move and does alot of damage to your opponents and lot better then Kaioken.|`|9CsoqJMiaa	my favorite is piccolo's ultimate move where he has many ki surrounding the enemy and it blows them up by closing in on them i played bt2 and i used this move and it kills|`|m0jJ94M5aa	Uub's Chocolate Attack...Yeah|`|7NYLoF9paa	bing bang attack.|`|7wVsKuQraa	adult trunks    heat dome    that move is sick

Ignore those other girls, they probably have to put a ton of make up on to make themselves look the way they do! You, from what I see don't have to put much make up on at all and you still look awesome!|`|ekbEMHozaa	You're cute, don't sweat it.|`|KH9bbeCNaa	god ur ugly!|`|RTHn0k0Taa	i really dont think your ugly|`|oVRA1ze2aa	girl please  you no you're cute so stop.3  My brother in law would date you cause he like Chic's that look like you and have dimples in there cheeks.|`|72a29394374017ab0f3283babed0be66aa	Whoever said you are ugly is a dirty liar. You have beautiful eyes and a very warm and friendly smile.|`|OnAoyAZFaa	YOUR BEAUTIFUL      but if your trying to look EVEN better (which you don't have to do) wear sexier clothes|`|2ca8aeddbc2242e1f6bb6f0d7dc98cc7aa	look in the mirror.  and tell us what things you like about yourself? (out loud or..  if you have to make a list on paper.)      if you still feel that way, after looking in the mirror then   look at mags. for hair ideas, clothes, or even make up ideas.|`|TsCMDYEkaa	you don't look ugly to me at all,and doubt very much that other people will think that. it is in your mind only,and the way you feel about yourself, but  that is only your perception NOT what is in reality., but when you talking about looking better we all benefit from a good hair style, but i can understand  you because when I was younger and really pretty I used to tear myself apart and think I was ugly too, and as I got older and my self acceptance, love, and confidence grew, so did the perception of me and now I know I am Not stunning, but I am very happy and content with myself. Good Luck I hope you feel better|`|Qkgu408Qaa	you aren't ugly! and im an honest person. but seriously, your eyes are so pretty.|`|fb5ac5faab424efb3d1e35f8fd315050aa	your cute and you no that!!|`|ojVVW1voaa	what are you talking about?  you have a really pretty face and i thought  that the minute i looked at you.    just get a really cute hair style that suits you.    :) you're pretty.|`|I4bALymyaa	A girl can't be truly be pretty without confidence. Smile and think "I am AMAZING" every day. You ARe pretty! Just smile and don't wear so much make up!!|`|Y9WZR4h2aa	first of all ur not ugly!    lose a bit of weight if you want to  maybe get a new hairstyle , wear makeup etc|`|TGIhhTEeaa	You're joking, right?  You are definitely not ugly.    Btw, TheHomerLisa is just being an idiot (29 people thumbed him down!).|`|I9FhmHkvaa	u are NOT ugly hun, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, once u start believing that u are beautiful, then and only then u will start feeling beautiful!|`|stRWElvPaa	wow you are actually really pretty..seriously.   If you want to put makeup on, maybe try some sparkly eyeshadow in a cream/silver colour, a little black eyeliner and mascara, and deep pink lip gloss.    But honestly, you have really pretty eyes, nice shaped nose and really nice shaped lips.|`|pmFFVhp2aa	You're not ugly! You have a very inviting smile and pretty eyes! I would suggest maybe some eye shadow to bring them out some more, but you don't really need it because you're beautiful!|`|ymK1hg2Raa	u aren't ugly!! you're pretty!    don't change a thing, you look fine!|`|76974d2e26a8eae367b1c5d82fe7c069aa	youre not ugly--trust me....if your feelin shabby,try getting a new wardrobe..sometimes change is good|`|kc1IBYMRaa	There's nothing wrong with that face!  We all fail to give ourselves enough credit.  I look at pictures from when I was a young person and I wonder why I didn't know what a cute kid I was!|`|lPgwZzoWaa	Your face is beautiful!!  I can't see your hair, maybe there is something you can do in that area???  As far as make up, what ever you are doing is great!!  Oh, clothing maybe???  Sweats are NOT polished!!  LOL|`|tVYjNEXmaa	OMG YOU ARE NOT UGLY!  Youuuuu have a very pretty smile  and I love your eyes.    What I would suggest is maybe a new haircut?  And if you're still not satisfied, maybe a little make-up.  Just some lip gloss and a little eyeliner just to enhance your already pretty eyes and smile. Don't go overboard though.    =]  But don't think you're ugly!    I'm pretty sure all those other "polished girls" wear like 20 pounds of make-up and whatnot.   Wellllllll yeahhhhhhhh!    But, I just want you to know that you're very pretty! =]]|`|W0jhffBfaa	First of all, you're really pretty! you have gorgeous eyes.  But all the answers on here say that! ;D If you really want to get some good suggestions, i'd reccomend asking a question in the beauty section, like 'what do you think i should do with my hair?' or something like that! i would give suggestions, but i really suck at beauty advice! lol! I'll try an outfit on that i think looks good, and my sister (younger, im 16 she's 14) and will be like, i REALLY hope you aren't planning to wear that in public.  So try asking specific questions like that if you want to look more 'polished', as you put it! Good luck!     P.S. It was nice to see someone else write 'gosh' instead!!!!|`|A3gkpGG6aa	Listen , Its the way god made you if you dont like it too bad|`|mVeR9UtNaa	u look fine to me. just have confidence. and if ur really worried try makeup. i think eye liner would make u look cute.

They are mainly "big brother" keeping an extensive data base.    However, these sites can be used to your advantage, in allowing your market as a writer or artist to be viewed in the general public arena.    Please be careful to not allow anyone to know the full extent of what you are doing, to prevent plagiarism.  Once you have written anything on the internet it is there forever.    Very much fun sites for the young and unaware to fill their computers full of what I would call youthful games of romantic aspirations.|`|b86908b5d46379b907bbdf809cf3c95aaa	I tried My Space and wasn't impressed.  I like Face Book.  I'm looking forward to the future with this site I think it's going to only increase in popularity.  Clean your temp files and cookies after use of course.  Take care.

482ec953acc2110dc059d6f3bd500670aa	If bass is not your best instrument the best thing you can do is KISS (keep it simple, stupid). No, that's not an insult; it's a well-known acronym. :)    Don't overdo it. Just play a basic bass line. The bass is supposed to be more in the background. It is important, but it's like the foundation of a house. You know it's there, and without it the house wouldn't be able to stand, but you want to see more of the house and less of the foundation. With bass, you need to lay down the foundation without distracting from the rest of the instruments and/or vocals.    Another very important thing to remember is to have good timing. Follow the drummer (if there's no drummer, follow the rhythm guitar). In live music, few things are more distracting than bad timing. Play along with a metronome to sharpen your skills.    Hope that helps! Good luck!|`|THdnS1f4aa	Sounds like your friend is trying to sabotage your music career.|`|fxAvsxMRaa	Well, you shouldn't have any problems learning the songs mentally, but physically if there's a bump in the road, simplify it, simple. But just remember, bass is a backbone instrument, have a jam with just you and the drummer so you can learn to fit each others playing style and become a tight single unit. Play with a pick if your not used to fingers by then. Also, learn the chord progressions of the songs instead of just the actual bassline, and just groove over the chords.

kUryFgB0aa	i answer slyly with a kick of truth, a dash of throughness, and a tad of smart-assery|`|AawnVShdaa	Umm. It depends on the question.

Spreading knowledge is a good thing, and the best way to do so is inform someone to the fullest extent possible so that they may later share with others the same knowledge you shared with them.    Though there are still times where upon completion of my answer I feel it was either much shorter or longer than intended. There's also times that I do indeed give silly answers, ones that may even deserve a thumbs down. But I try to only associate intelligence with my answers.|`|xm0kLvnLaa	Depending on the Q I usually answer thoroughly (eg. in singles & dating or health), however on occasion I answer smart *** because I regard it a completely pathetically, stupid Q, eg, I read in heath recently "does injecting heroin affect my pill?"

Augusta-It is of Latin origin, and this name means "great, magnificent".    January- I looked up what January means but it says January is not a name. I think that would make it very unique and different. (In a good way.)    December- I looked up December and found that most babies that are born in December are named Christmas, or Noel.    May-It is of English origin, and its meaning is "the fifth month". The month of May was named for Maia, the Roman earth goddess. Also a short form of the names Matthew and Mary. Also a Sanskrit word meaning "illusion". See also Mai. Actress Mae West; writer Maya Angelou; poet May Saton. When I hear the name "May" I think of a beautiful little flower.    September- The girl's name September is a month name that is not as common as April, May, or June. Very Cool.    April-The girl's name April, It is of Latin origin, and its meaning is "to open". The month as a given name; often used to symbolize spring, the time when buds open and flowers appear.    *All these are really cool names but I like May, April, and Augusta the most. Good luck picking a name!!!! Hope this helps.

d3eb6a170cb28c548de0605367e3cf24aa	ASCAP (American Society of Composers Authors and Performers) is a performing rights organization which licenses and collects royalties for performance of music. ASCAP's licensees encompass all who want to perform copyrighted music publicly. Of course, you're talking about a private performance which seems harmless. However, it still breaks copyright laws to record anyone's music, public or private (even churches have to pay royalties for a teeny, tiny church gathering of people if someone plays or sings anything). But I take it that you want to know how to make it "right" so my suggestion would be to simply write to the manager or song writer of the performer or you could probably even write to ASCAP and ask them what to do in your situation. I've acquired permission to use a famous musician's music on my website via email, which was very nice, easy and FAST. They probably wouldn't have cared either way, but I wanted to make absolutely SURE that it was okay and having it in writing makes me feel much better. :) Hope this helps...|`|aR6KApCbaa	You can buy karaoke versions which then give you the rights to sing them.

6fc5e5999a1fac5d839878eb3f367d9daa	1- Diários de Uma Paix?o, The Notebook. Um história de amor que é impossível esquecer...! Lembran?as que s?o uma li??o de vida. Recomendo a todos!...Aqueles que acreditam no mais puro e verdadeiro amor de um ser humano para um outro cora??o. <br>  <br>  2- Quando Os Anjos Falam, A Rumor Of Angels. nesta história comovente sobre o poder ilimitado da amizade e do amor. Arrasado pela morte de sua m?e, James (Morgan), um garoto de 12 anos, está tendo um ver?o muito solitário em Cape Cód... até conhecer Maddy (Redgrave), a velhinha excêntrica que mora no farol. Contudo, quando o pai de James (Liotta) descobre o caráter transcendental das conversas da tal improvável dupla, ele proíbe a amizade... colocando a recém-descoberta cren?a de James no poder do amor e a cren?a de Maddy no poder da vida à dura prova! Uma experiência de vida que vai fazer você pensar ao final...sobretudo a impotancia dos valores da vida. <br>  <br>  3- Terra de Sonhos, In America. Terra de Sonhos" é um filme deslumbrante, que mostra uma carismática família irlandesa que se muda para a Terra das Oportunidades, dos sonhos: os EUA. Mesmo nem tudo sendo fácil como parece, a vis?o das duas meninas (Que est?o fascinantes!) é otimista e cheia de brilho. Samantha Morton e Paddy Constantine, que fazem o papel dos pais das meninas est?o ótimos, e o ator Djimon Hounston, que faz o papel do enigmático Mateo realmente foi um coadjuvante que mereceu a indica??o ao Oscar. Com músicas como "Desperado" e a linda cena de quando a família chega aos EUA, com "Do you Believe in Magic" mostram todo o talento do diretor Jim Sheridan e sua sensibilidade. "Terra de Sonhos" é um filme para ver e rever muitas vezes! Contada de uma forma muito especial através do olhar de duas garotas adolescentes, Christy e Ariel, essa história, divertida em muitos momentos, mas sempre cativante, fala sobre lembran?as segredos, amor, perda e recome?o. Mas antes que as meninas e seus pais, Johnny (Paddy Considine) e Sarah (Samantha Morton), possam viver de modo pleno os desafios e maravilhas de seu novo lar, eles precisam dominar e curar feridas do passado, cujo espectro os assombra. <br>  <br>  S?o filmes pouco conhecidos , mas que mereciam destaque. Aprenda, Viva, Seja Você!

Na minha opini?o, os clássicos da Walt Disney - os desenhos como Rei Le?o, A Bela e a Fera e tantos outros - passam uma mensagem positiva muito grande e de valor para nosso emocional e que agrada todas as idades. Por exemplo: no desenho O Rei Le?o 1, passa um conteúdo que n?o devemos fugir dos problemas do passado, mas para que sejamos vencedores devemos enfrentá-los de frente e sem medo.

I think they drugged her & made it look asthough she overdosed on her own. If this is what happened it would be similar to how her son died & it's a coincidence her husband was around both times. <br>  The reasons or motive is most likely for her money and custody of her daughter (as Howard Stern is convinced she's his child)|`|690b3808eabbee3f9bbe1bea3dd4a2d9aa	I think ot was an drug overdose.|`|AA11851209	I think she was depressed, but Howard made it easy for her to get drugs- so I feel he kept her that way on purpose. He stans to the inheritence. Tell me honestly, if you loved someone so much, would yopu allow them to go out in public and humiliate themselves? A real loved one would have gotten her help, not more pills to take. You do know that most of the pills in her room belonged to Howard, not her!

Then her son died just after she had a new baby... now she is dead, and only one person was around for all of this.. her "lawyer".. who also claims to be the father of the child. (are you following this?) and has blocked an emergency DNA test for a paternity challenge. All the potential heirs of the $500 million are now dead except the kid, and the "lawyer" stands to controll the fortune as her father until she turns 21 or so. Sweet deal, eh?|`|b9619bf4847242afa0c567f17b4de475aa	it wasn't a drug overdose using pills of any kind at least- when she was being checked out they found no pills in her stomach, so it wasn't that, i think posion or something like that- maybe even suisde because of the bad rep she was getting about her son's death- im not really sure- it was a total shocker when i heard about it the other day!|`|18b9d2996ca522b009053674a3e81901aa	Deppression.|`|116ed7431575eb1d31a4f1cf889dc190aa	alcohol, drugs and stupidity. we will never know the real reason, the coroner has probably already been paid off.|`|0d99eaca283364a497894b446881d1ceaa	I think she was partially conscious of what she was doing to herself (suicide) but wansn't expecting to die.|`|285a2ddcb1cac81180fd72ccf0a75df3aa	Depression.

Plus, where was her supposed "husband" at?|`|L2irYZLraa	It could be because of depression, but she did have her little girl to think about. I think it was because of money! I think her husband killed her for her $$$$$.<br>  Why else would he marry her? she was beautiful but all the drug and alcohol abuse over the yrs messed up her brain. U could hardly understand her!

Please join me in remembering a great icon. The Pillsbury Dough boy died yesterday of a yeast infection and complications from repeated pokes in the belly. He was only 51. Dough boy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay there respects, including Mrs. Butter worth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies and Captain Crunch. <br>  <br>  The gravesite was piled high with flours, as long-time friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded. Dough boy rose quickly in show business but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times, he even still, as a crusty old man, was considered a roll model for millions. Toward the end it was thought that he would rise again, but alas, he was no tart. <br>  <br>  Doughboy is survived by his wife, Play Dough, two children, John Dough and Jane Dough, plus they had one in the oven. He is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart. The funeral was held at 3:50 for about twenty minutes|`|618f66fd753ac0a989e0b354cc2e4b84aa	2 points|`|6914eb3118a4b60b59037bf139ddf68eaa	look in a mirror

9f3051c65c40526e199c2b40ca3819ddaa	It sounds like you might have "beginner" cymbals, whose main feature is low price. So, you are ready to move up to a better cymbal. Zildjian is the legendary cymbal maker but Sabian and Paiste are very popular with drummers, also. I don't think you can go wrong with these manufacturers. However, you need to stay away from the "beginner" sets(usually a set of hats, crash and ride). I got the Zildjian ZBT beginner series and my wife said it sounded like hitting the bottom of a pot. My drum teacher was able to get a decent sound out of the hats but then he can get a good sound out of a rock; I returned them and on my teachers advice, got some cheap used cymbals that sounded equally bad but at 1/3 the price, until I could afford to pay for good cymbals. Anyway, the point is, even with a quality cymbal maker, you need to pay some serious money to get a good sounding cymbal. From that point, it's the type of  music you play and personal preference, as these manufacturers provide you a lot of choices. Ideally, you have a music store nearby which allows you to try the various models so you get cymbals with the sound you want otherwise you'll need to get some ideas from other muscians who play the type of music you play.|`|AA12022188	Go buy some Ziljian or Sabian cymbals. They are the industries best|`|a4e39d3b2731cf2459764cefa8cd2b52aa	Zilgian|`|ug7OQvh9aa	Depends on how much you want to spend.  When buying cymbals, you really do get what you pay for.<br>  <br>  Zildjian, Paiste and Sabian are the most popular brands and each have various price ranges for different quality. There are a ton of other brands..Meinl is quickly becoming a favorite for it's innovation andd designs.<br>  <br>  If you are buying sheet cymbals (for example Zildjians ZBT line or Sabian's B8 line), it's ok to buy online, because these are consistent from one cymbal to the next.  These are usually entry-level lines of cymbals.  Relatively inexpensive and great to start out with, but I guarantee you will be looking to upgrade in the future.<br>  <br>  When you start looking at cast/hand-hammered cymbals, you will be better off going to a music store so you can hear the individual cymbal first.  Each cymbal will have it's own pitch/tonal qualities and you really need to pick one yourself.  You don't want to pay top dollar for a cymbal that sucks!<br>  <br>  Check out these websites:|`|bc3ba2c9c87e6b9774330feca7400ad9aa	Zildjian is, in my opinion, the best on the market. The Avedis Zildjian company has been around for over 300 years. They've gotta be doing something right. Sabian is actually owned by one of the Zildjians, Robert Zildjian, who split from the family business to go to work for himself. They are expensive though. For a basic set, expect to pay at least $160 for a crash, $250 for a ride, and same hats. Give or take, I haven't bought them in years but I've noticed they've gone up. If you want the best, but are on a budget, hop on ebay, make sure you don't get any that are cracked, those are worthless. The "A" series are the best. And they are just as good used, provided they are not cracked. You can get some great deals. As long as they are top quality cast cymbals, you'll be happy with what you get. You're not gonna get a cymbal that doesn't sound good. The reason many don't like buying online is because they are at a point that they are looking for a particular sound. Right now, you'll be fine with online and getting these models. Here are some great models:<br>  <br>  New Beats are great all around hi hat's<br>  A Rock ride is also nice, with great stick definition, <br>  I also like the paper thin crashes, they have a sharp attack and quick delay.

a1d490fd71d887b5aaecf2cf50e8e99daa	I was around 12 years old... at the bowling alley... waiting for my mother to come pick me up.  I didn't have any money left.  But I was standing near the doorway near a race car game.  This game had a steering wheel on it. The wheel had thick spokes with circles in it.  The circles were all different sizes.  I was sticking my fingers in and out of the circles from larger one to the small one.  Well... my ring finger on my right hand got stuck and I could NOT get it out.  My mom shows up in the car outside and it waving for me to come out.  I can't. She is getting some mad!  She finally comes in and sees what has happened.  She calls over the person working to see if he has some soap to put on my finger.  He tried that.. it did not work.  He said "This is my first night working here".  I felt so stupid.   Anyways.. he called the fire department.  Yep... They had to saw THE METAL around my finger to get it out.  I ran to the bathroom crying afterwards.   I didn't go back to the bowling alley for a good 6 months.  When I did, I stepped inside and a man says "Hey, aren't you that girl who had her finger stuck in the machine".  I wanted to die.

So about the second day of skiing my friend has to pee REALLY bad. We are on top of a mountain so there is nowhere to go. So I sugest she sit down and ride on her butt all the way down to the ski lodge and go there. She said she'd only go if I went with her so I did. When we finally got back she was crying because she was in so much pain. We started running back to our room to go to the bathroom and at the same time she was stripping off her ski clothes. When we got to our room we realized we didn't have a key so we had to run down the hall to one of the guys room and use theirs because they were in it. WELLLL turns out she couldn't  get out of her ski clothes in time so she ended up peeing in her pants. It was a  huge gross mess and the worst part was that 6 guys sat on their beds and watched the whole thing. We still make fun of her to this day!|`|AA12116844	Walked and swaggered around the office for half a day before realising that the zipper on my pants was busted.

"G-Unit got a new mixtape out, got me dressed up like a stripper, it looked kinda cute. But, the motherf****n' Game don't do no stripping. The Game will strip one of them fagot *** niggas butt naked and rob they punk ***." Game then went into his G-Unot mode for a couple of seconds. It was rumored last year that Jay-Z had a video of Game stripping, which he allegedly was planning on using in his I Declare War concert at Madison Square Garden. Sources say that the "video" is now in the posession of Game's manager, Jimmy Henchman. Game's second album The Doctor's Advocate will be dropping on November 7th. His first single, titled One Blood, will drop at the end of July.<br>  <br>  The rest of the story and a picture is on the website.|`|52dafbcecb426ff68ebb19389d3ebb20aa	umm i dont know it kinda sounds like it! but i would not look at him differnt beacuse that is all in the past now!! so u should just let that go and like him for who he is not the old stripper version of him!!

d57d9356839fe67b856c547bc20ec437aa	Stars Hollow es el singular pueblo en el que se desarrolla la trama de "Las Chicas Gilmore". Mucha gente se pregunta o se ha preguntado si este pueblo existe en la realidad. y lo cierto es que, por desgracia, no existe. Así a todo la serie intenta ubicarlo en el mapa americano de manera general. Y podemos decir que, de existir, Stars Hollow estaría en Conéctica.<br>  <br>  Sí, Stars Hollow no existe pero interacciona con otras ciudades americanas como Hartford y New Haven. Hartford es la ciudad en la que se encuentra la mansión de los Gilmore y el colegio de Chilton. Por lo tanto podríamos situar alrededor de ese punto nuestro peque?o y especial rincón del planeta.<br>   Pero vayamos a la verdadera localización de "Stars Hollow". "Las Chicas Gilmore" se graba en los estudios de la WB en Burbank, California, lugar donde se desarrollan gran parte de los proyectos de los estudios televisivos. Por poner un ejemplo Burbank es el lugar donde está el set de "Alias". Lo que vemos en nuestras pantallas no es una ciudad, por supuesto. Aunque algunos son edificios (con decorados dentro) la estructura de Stars Hollow está formada por falsas fachadas. Y ni los edificios se encuentran colocados tal y como vemos en la serie sino que se enlazan unos con otros. Por poner un ejemplo, si cruzásemos la puerta de la casa de Sookie y avanzásemos acabaríamos saliendo al porche de nuestras chicas.|`|08df85ad424acf397f4a2567229e00edaa	Existee??

wnyuH0aTaa	Okay.    You need to work on your tone - but that could be down to the camcorder as they do have crappy mics usually.    You clearly have a talent for the bas, but try playing it below the 12 fret once or twice. Remember it's a bass and sadly it's a guitarist's world out there - they just let us play in it (but they always need us!!!) but it need to be under the guitar pounding out. Bass is also about being part of a song too and solo improv is hard to keep interesting. Try playing against a drum track or drum machine, that'd be my top tip.    rating: 10/10 for effort and 7/10 for execution (at this stage.)

They sound good, but you need to use the top strings more if you want to play in band. It's called bass for a reason.    Usually, when doing a bass solo, you need to have some sort of base note that you need to keep returning to. At the start of every bar, you would play that note, and start improvising on that scale from there again.    For example: Say I was improvising on a Pentatonic E. I would start by playing the E, and then start improvising by playing notes on that scale. At the start of ever bar (Or, occasionly, every second bar), I would play the E again and then continue improvising.    None of these are essential, but trust me, they make your bass solos sound a helluva lot better.    The solos you played there sound brilliant, but they're much more the kind of riff that would be used for an intro, not something you'd interrupt a song for.|`|4RL0GLtJaa	tehtehehthehr|`|I08iONdaaa	rating scale 1 to 5  1  1  1.2  1  1    boring as f**k|`|g2QUNwZzaa	sweet! you play bass like i play guitar...  wanna jam???????????????????/    edit- umm dude, you need to chill with the adding details, like, you can't play bass and ask the public for opinions if u can't handle people might say its not that good. and i know what u mean about crappy mics, they can totally make something sound nothing like you think it hears like|`|lwii0XCvaa	kso yeah,   were deff getting married ;)|`|kOVp9F0oaa	nice    1-7  2-5  310  4-sorry couldn't hear anything on my cmptr  5-same like  4

rVy4UQs7aa	I don't really know what you are talking about, but I will try my best to answer your question. If you are asking for where you could find free world magazine and not a online one.  Well, you see, the magazine companies only get the money from buyers. They don't make much money by giving free magazines. But magazine only cost like 10 dollars a year. So that's not really expensive.   But if you really want to ge the free magazine.   You should try www.freemag.com!!  I hope this helps!!
TohAUyjjaa	I love all of his albums because he is my favorite singer. if i had to chose though i would probely say time weel wasted but like i said i love all of them so it is kinda hard to chose.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Well, as a musician, I really love PLAY.  As a country music fan, I'd probably go with TIME WELL WASTED.    Of course, PLAY is still my favorite.  I mean, it's the single greatest album of Paisley's to prove that he's more than just another country guitarist--it can show some ignorant guitarists (any who hate country just because it's country) that he can not only play country guitar very well, but also that he can play surf rock, blues, jazz, rock and bluegrass!      EDIT:  Actually, I'm not sure if TIME WELL WASTED is my favorite, next to PLAY.  I mean, I know PLAY is my all-time favorite, but I just don't know which of the others I like the most.  In all truth, I think ALL of his albums are great and they each have some of the finest country guitar work out there...hell--they all have some of the finest guitar work, regardless of genre!      Kayla K:  Paisley is my favorite artist as well!  Not only is he my favorite country artist, but he is also my all-time favorite guitarist...I can't get enough of his guitar work!|`|EdtUUzVHaa	time well wasted or mud on the tires.   all of them are really good though|`|Iv38jvnnaa	i like Part 2. that's probably my favorite.  i also liiike 5th Gear. =]

6a847c91344f2a46951de52b63f203a6aa	I once had a girl likie this and we kept at it for a while usually on a Friday or saturday when drunk, there was no real commitment but we were friends and we done the family and friends thing, but after about three months I had to sit her down and tell her that i didnt see her as anything else and even if it continued i would still be going with other girl's luckilly she felt the same and took it well, it carried on less frequentley fro a while and eventually we both met other people and it fizzled out, we both knew it was just sex and going nowhere it seems to me you must get some answers, if you are happy just giving him oral when you drunk crack on but if your not find out if there is anything in it from his side.|`|b041a83714805af3b9ebc0513b879952aa	i would probably stay friends with her and as much as i dont want to say it, i would see her sometimes as a fckbuddy|`|a91167324526f69f7742fd5361cdf96daa	yea if I was hard up and horny|`|38abb4e3e12a5b63af682efe0e25e80daa	Its weird.,,,,,deviant?|`|AA12231383	sorry i know you said come on guys and im not but if she is such a good friend sorry you said closest friend WHY  would you treat her like this then tell total strangers about it|`|ebbd497e21b89d833633b9e1a1bb36ebaa	Well, if this is the case, you must like her to some extent. After all, alcohol is the great leveller (literally), and it allows one's true feelings to come out. Plus, you've had oral sex once sober. If it was just her doing it to you, then it's just a BJ, nothing more complicated than that. But if you performed oral on each other when sober, that's a more definite sign that you do like her sexually, even if you think you don't. I know that sounds strange, but you could just not think of her like that, but then get her in the bedroom and realise that yes, you probably could see her in that way after all.<br>  <br>  They do say that people can usually decide on first meeting whether or not they could sleep with someone - it's an almost subconscious 'yes' or 'no' reaction. Thinking back to when you first met her, what reaction would you honestly think you had then? If you're anything like me, it would probably be an instant 'yes' which is then dismissed or overlooked because she's a friend and it doesn't normally occur to you to think of her in that way.......until some time later, when something happens and the subconscious feelings/motivations re-surface.<br>  <br>  I think, in a complicated way, I'm trying to say that if you didn't have some feelings for her - whether sexual, emotional, or otherwise - you wouldn't be ABLE to have sex with her, drunk or sober. Your brain has obviously allowed you to have sex with her, so the barriers to this aren't all that strong.<br>  <br>  Anyway, to end on a glib note, when you're 95 and sitting in a bath chair, unable to walk, you'll look back and say 'I wish I'd had more sex'. I know that's glib, but think about it.|`|32dd61db7ef6e771c768e9d68f94626eaa	I'm sorry, I got to the 3rd paragraph and bored myself....

That's why I don't sit in the front! But there is a way to be funny, and not be offensive. I agree that comedians like D.L Hugley are famous for pointing out anything and anything on audience a member. He will even make a racial reference. But he is a professional. He does it in a way that stays true comedy. When you start to attack someone and step out of the roll of being a comedian, that's when the line has been crossed and it comes off as offensive.

If for example you know that some of your relatives lived in Jessamine County, KY, google "jessamine county kentucky genealogy" and you can find free compilations by local genealogical societies.  Not every place has one, but you may get lucky.  Otherwise, spend 20-30 bucks, try out Ancestry for a month, and find out all you can.  Then you may be able to find free sites that help you out from there.<br>  <br>  Also you can physically, i.e. not on a computer, go and check out the records of your city, county, state, etc.  My wife is from Buffalo, and she was able to find wedding records, census info and immigration records down at the city records department.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Halliwell, 33, welcomed Bluebell Madonna in May.<br>  <br>  EMMA BUNTON (BABY)<br>  <br>  Then: The youngest Spice, Bunton really was babied by her bandmates.

Debbie Reynolds plays an over-eager clerk in a large department store and Eddie Fisher plays the boss' son. After getting fired from her job, she finds an adorable baby on the steps of the foundling home and the folks inside mistake her for the mother. Fisher, well-meaning, but obtuse, tries to help her out with the baby, and the buds of romance begin to appear.

Aside from the fact that it would be pointless to lie about dating Emma or anyone else, I seriously doubt Daniel has time to "date" anyone right now.<br>  <br>  He filmed the movie December Boys (which is being released this August) in between Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix, and only finished filming OOTP a little before the holidays.  He spent the holidays in Austrailia with his parents, then went back to London in time to begin rehearsals for Equus on January 3rd.  Although I'm not sure what the rehearsal schedule will be like, the play opens mid-February and runs through June 9, 2007 with performances EVERY night except Sunday, and there are two performances every Wednesday and Saturday.  He also has plans to do a movie for British TV called My Boy Jack to be released sometime in 2007, and presumably will be expected to make appearances at the world premieres when OoTP is released in July.  And it is quite likely that filming for Half-Blood Prince will start sometime in 2007.<br>  <br>  Honestly...when would he have time to date?|`|e3e41e84b0e99d2eee33c81d3848ed0baa	i think they aren't..  because i heard and read it in a mag that harry potter and that other like japanese type girl in goblet of fire is harry's REAL girlfriend. he started going out with her after the movie.. i think that they are up to something... lollzz.. that couples not bad either...|`|ad7cc2718a1d2b3afa51ee5078bccd12aa	no i do not think they are going out|`|AA10490535	Maybe they would have been the most perfect couple in HP, but seriously...

04830ff9addfcfcf0bb3b7ad697c8b42aa	Again, the produces decided to keep this one a secret too. Ward works in downtown Mayfield. Ward’s main job seems to be writing a lot of reports. He has a secretary, and sometimes records into a dictating machine. Ward mentions the "the Thompson deal" and "the Miller audits". There is a branch office in Mexico City, and a main office in New York. Ward attends sales meeting and works with the company’s marketing department. Occasional, Ward travels to a company conference.<br>  <br>  Some speculate Ward is was an Accountant. This would be a logical deduction, but certainly not foolproof.<br>  <br>  A LITB fan wrote to me: " I believe he was an executive in either a construction or an architectural firm, .... first, he was in the SeeBee's, so he would have had a background in construction, second, in one episode before being interrupted by a call from June he was heard reading the riot act on the telephone to what seemed to be a contractor (project was behind schedule), third, in an episode during which Ward was looking at old pictures from his service days he commented on one of the guys: "Would you believe he's now the best architect in Chicago?" .... now while that could be interpreted as rhetorical, an argument could be made that Ward would know how good the guy was because he had a knowledge of the business .... while individually these clues are not overly compelling, I believe together they provide a reasonably good argument"|`|dd4981d2634eeb833eb481415443f77eaa	husband/father and bread EATER.

I've seen her answers around before though, and most of the time they don't even make sense to the question. This is just an example but I bet if someone asked "what's your favorite color?" she'd say, "Pray to Jesus for the answer".

vEDdzlldaa	Lol, I had a dream about Tokio Hotel a few days ago...    Me and Bill were at this playground. Like it was a HUGE thing to climb on, lol. And at first I was trying to talk to Bill and balance/climb up on this weird ladder thing at the same time. Then all of the sudden it was Tom instead of Bill o.O. And Tom was like climbing all over the playground thing and being all athletic like, haha and I was just sitting on the ground watching him because I couldn't keep my balance on anything. Then Tom was hanging on the monkey bars above me and feel off...on top of me and couldn't get up because we kept tripping over each other -.-'. And I felt guilty because I liked Bill...Then all of the sudden Bill came back so I ran over to him and I was talking to him when these two other girls showed up that were supposed to be Tom's girlfriends, haha, but they got mad at Tom because they said he was cheating on them and they yelled at him and then left him. So I felt bad for him and went to give him a hug..and as I was hugging him he turned into a laundry basket (    It was...quite a weird experience....lol, but it was a good dream :D I'm kinda worried about what it might mean though....o.O|`|LRLu1ofNaa	I have dreams about All Time Low, mostly Alex Gaskarth.

And all the people who call him gay at my school were so jealous and were like "OMG you're so lucky!"    =(

Any particular reason it has to be Korean?  The only reason I ask is because they're a lot of great Asian horror films out there.  Especially Japanese horror movies such a Ju-on (one of the scariest movies I've ever seen) and Audition (almost too sick to watch).  However, the US versions/remakes aren't anywhere close to what the originals were, so I don't recommend substituting any of the newer English remakes for the original Japanese/Korean versions (with subtitles); the experience is all together different and a lot scarier.

pLPKo6mBaa	Peaches has lost his grip on the English language methinks. XD    I LUFF Krypteria!!!    In Medias Res (2005) is their more symphonic-y album, lol. You might like "Why", "Quae Laetitia", and their cover of "Carol of the Bells" but the whole album is pretty!    I haven't listened to all of Bloodangel's Cry (2007) but so far it seems to have some industrial/electronic influences. "All Systems Go" and "Scream" are interesting songs. :P    Now that you reminded me of it, I think they're coming out with a new album this year!!    Anyway the band is cool. I think the singer is Korean while the band members are German, or somethin along those lines.|`|6EoAKcMwaa	Wow Darth. I really liked "Time To Bring the Pain" I really like the operatic vocals.

56bNLJykaa	probably Synecdoche, New York- as I am not too big a fan of new hollywood films such as most mentioned on this list, I do like Charlie Kaufman- Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and now he is finally directing- with this movie.

T6WYXtdfaa	Neither.|`|hVGyhpMmaa	Doo-Good.|`|c8TXAAj1aa	Looks like Dooey-gooey to me.
W4yp5dybaa	to show that a person didn't just make up the commercial then air it. by saying it they are showing that the president has reviewed it.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	I agree.
OXSOch9Oaa	Because prior to 2004 (I believe) they didn't have to approve the messages.  Therefore the opposite campaigns would make a lot of ads full of lies in an attempt to hurt the other person's campaign.  The ads might still be full of lies, but at least this time the candidates have to approve them and know what they're approving first.|`|T3NVQr8naa	Because if you aren't working for that person, you legally can not say it. So it weeds out which are official or not. If it says, "I am (insert name), and I approve this message," it better be true or the people who made that commercial will get a FAT lawsuit from that person.|`|mPrUYEDiaa	So that phony's can't go around making commercials that say things about the president elect that aren't true. for instance, president elect Mr. Joe, we'll call him, is all for gay marriage, but someone doesn't like him, and they want to make sure he doesn't make it for president, so they do a commercials saying that he is AGAINST gay marriage, so people look down on him, and he doesn't win. by saying "I approve this message" it means that the president elect knows about the commercial and its contents, and approves of it.|`|h00bqU7baa	Because they want the world to hear them say "i aprove this message"|`|9RDKfgHnaa	don't know, that is a good question I need some points can you give me some to get to level 2 please.|`|yPftJbNvaa	well they say that because all the presidents are trying to get more people to vote for them and all the security people are watching so in case they see it they know it was made by him.|`|AA11185479	Most candidates are legally required to approve ads supporting them.  Otherwise, "Citizens for Joe Schmoe" could make any sort of slanderous moronic claim about his opponent, and Joe Schmoe wouldn't be held accountable for what his supporters did.  It's an attempt to restrain mudslinging political campaigns.|`|74jTo7o8aa	because they do..|`|jtYL9Qqnaa	for legal matters or something|`|AVDTZ63Oaa	To differentiate their own official campaign media from those of Political Action Committees and other organizations that may be buying advertisements on behalf of or against a given candidate.|`|I08iONdaaa	because it's there way of saying "this is me speaking" and not somebody else. Any crack pot can make a commercial and put it on the air if they choose, or write something in a newspaper supporting a candidate. But not every candidate wants endorsements from certain groups, or to affiliate themselves with "supportive" messages that offend the larger majority of the american people. It's basically like a signature on a piece of paper, formally asserting the candidates affiliation with the given "message".|`|pOrwteQUaa	It's more of a political move that involves traditions and so on.|`|oKyimeaMaa	Clint Eastwood demanded it from the presidents|`|AI4My948aa	It's the law baby  cuz of all those lobbyists|`|XEGG1l6Raa	because they want people to know that they approve the message..lol...seriously|`|Ng2xjVKLaa	Because some people don't get the commercial and then they say it to make sense.|`|wnkj0b41aa	Because some commercials are not put out by the President or his/her campaign. The "I approve this message" proves to people that the President agrees with whats said in the message.|`|QJbFD1T0aa	DUH so that people know that that thats person thats running ideas.. not someone pretending 2 be obama or mccain or something... so people know its not like plagurism|`|BWPtZkIDaa	bcuz ppl need 2 kno that other ppl (opponents) arent makin things up 2 trash them.... they approve that wat is being said on the commercials is 100% true|`|uG9tuIfFaa	Because they don't want real people **Not obama or McCain** to make commericals about it and make their views different, and make up lies about that.  By putting that at the end of the commerical, it is sorta like a copyright  and it means that it really is their views.    -x-|`|yXB5LOE2aa	Because they're off the chain. Litterally.|`|vyOtJyqkaa	so it's obviouse that they support the message and the network didn't just make it up.|`|5YnhWj6jaa	They just want you to know that they support that issue/subject. It's basically their way to drill their views into your head so you don't forget.    At least, that's what I think.|`|RLuiEdpDaa	Just in case.  Some people might cheat without permission.|`|38rwVxqmaa	if the president doesn't say that  then anyone can make fake commercials without getting the presidents approval|`|lCHcKdbXaa	Someone might make a comercial that says something that ruins thier chances or something, im sure they wouldnt approve it if it was like that|`|VxZnyx25aa	just evidence that some1 didn't make that commercial to try to set them up|`|Qswzc6w7aa	Because they could have made the commercial without their knowledge. So they have to approve it.
TBIAIAcnaa	I'm usually alone|`|fdP9UJOsaa	All the time, doesn't everyone?|`|8815883e2ab4555a79f3a28621142ab1aa	Yeah, but it's more fun when you've got ppl around.. i just get bored and end up buying nothing when i go alone cuz i always want to get a second opinion on what i buy    Have fun purse shopping tomorrow!|`|isosFXBdaa	no|`|lgIuhKN4aa	Yeah.  Just put your ipod in and zone out. That's what i do. xD|`|i3pF86HNaa	yeah.|`|aqLDMy2Maa	yes only because I no choice to.  meaning the mall had the one item I needed and I could not get it any other place.|`|jeZmqhNcaa	Like without my parents yea, totally alone, no|`|BV2e9M5saa	Nope, I perfer company o-o|`|Qih2hKqkaa	They grow up so fast!  My son flew 2000 miles alone the see his grandmother when he was just 12!|`|gwjBvXTbaa	Yes I have.  One time to pick up a new computer for my dad  and one time just to walk around and get away from home  and today to get my friend a b-day present.|`|AA10123022	Wow, you're going to the mall alone! I hope no one sees you, they may think you don't have any friends..|`|y5FfKGAsaa	nah. i've been to the mall with someone & went to different places, but not entirely by myself.|`|LRYKlzkpaa	well one time i went to the mall with my mom but she was bugging me so i ditched her. It is actually really fun going to the mall by yourself.|`|Xxn7DssEaa	yeah i work there lol|`|NnlL3usKaa	Yeah...|`|90MSfEGSaa	yes|`|q4LLJvjvaa	your 16!!!!! you will be fine!!!! im 13 and i always wonder off alone lol but someones there... just not with me lol YOULL BE FINE!|`|vED4iORiaa	Yea all the time. I meet people there, I run into people. Or i go alone to the bookstore and sit there and read stuff i wont buy|`|rKbeXJPfaa	No. I'm weird about going anywhere on my own. But i think it would be good for me to do! Get some independance lol. Go for it :) x|`|PvlbqhlPaa	no|`|WA2Kn1EDaa	Yeah, I like it that way.|`|WfmHoFHbaa	yeah!im 19 and my friends cant shop alone, but i hate shopping with others, unless i really want an opinion on something. usually i end up getting mad at whoever im with if we're clothes shopping so its better to go alone for me|`|nKMJ9U3Paa	No..*gulp* I'm afraid of the Mall Moles...their everywhere. *glances over her shoulder* Don't go...don't go!! lol|`|pmFFVhp2aa	Yes, many times. I actually find it easier going by myself. That way I can go into stores that I want to go in and take my time, not worrying about if I'm holding the person I'm with up from going where they want.    I don't mind shopping by myself at all.|`|9Y1j0hY0aa	yeh, i have|`|3005d3b9180d1ef915398a770d0e19f2aa	Yes|`|hVlh6XQeaa	yes, ive went several times alone. (usually becuz nobody else was out of school.) but anyways, yeah ive been alone.|`|iT0Z2icCaa	sure you are old enough to go alone , be careful take your cell phone with you and make sure you tell your parents and what time to expect you home , enjoy it and happy shopping ,|`|WjTqtvHCaa	Yeah|`|hxNBgXXaaa	nope always with friends x|`|ocQClvjMaa	Never... but I think I'll try it.|`|KMxCDOPCaa	A couple times|`|gbBVscbJaa	I so agree with prodigy!POSER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ko3J5akPaa	i always go alone, im always alone for everything lol. im 18 tho|`|5YnhWj6jaa	No I haven't. My parents come along every time. Doesn't bother me, I'm not embarrassed.    Make sure you don't put yourself in a bad situation. [Don't be in a parking garage alone at night, or something like that.]|`|se0NiMTVaa	yes and i find it better when im going shopping because friends get bored and anxious and make you rush when you go alone you have all the time to do it with no distractions nor complaints.   i know i get anxious when my friend is shopping and takes a while so i just rather go alone. trust me its not bad|`|jHA3pl4Jaa	I have never been to the mall alone. However, I only go to the mall with my friends, not parents. If you want to go to the mall, I suggest that you go to the mall with a friend for safety reasons, plus it is more fun that way. Have fun.
Hzf3QK9faa	Yep. Joejorob and I have a theory about those days. When we don't give up and give in on those days it's good. We believe that those days tend to come along when we are getting close to something real good, otherwise why would it feel like something has pulled out the stops on trying to stop us in our tracks. And thank God for all the angels in our lives that help us along when it tries to get rough!|`|AA11749193	Hi- Yes, sure have.....Guess that what it means when you hear the phrase "When it rains, it pours."

Lo and behold, that horse -- a very long shot -- won the race.    Before the following race, the Priest blessed yet another horse. Mitch made a beeline for the window, and placed a small bet on the horse. Again, even though it was another long shot, the horse the priest had blessed won the race.    Mitch collected his winnings, and anxiously waited to see which horse the priest would bless for the 6th race. The priest showed, blessed a horse, Mitch bet a large amount of money on it, and it won!    True to his pattern, the priest stepped out onto the track before the last race and blessed the forehead, eyes, ears, and hooves of one of the horses.    Mitch bet every cent he had, including his life savings and the deed to his house. Mitch then watched the horse come in dead last. He was dumbfounded.    He made his way to the track, and when he found the priest, he demanded, "What happened, Father? All day long you blessed horses and they won. The last race, you blessed a horse and he lost. Now, thanks to you, I've lost all my savings!"    The priest nodded wisely and said, "That's the problem with Protestants -- you can't tell the difference between a simple blessing and the Last Rites!|`|ZefydJ8Gaa	whats a moggy?    oh i love kitties they are nice to cuddle with, they are pretty much like a dog only its less work to take care of them|`|IFs6MWDJaa	There good for an at home Abortion|`|pOrwteQUaa	"Owning" is the term used in games that stands for "you gut beat" or "i beat you and you suck."

The top right card represents the second possible outcome. Ten of Tomes (The Eltdown Shards): Success and gain, leading you to take on a burden greater than you can carry. Noble leadership transformed, through lack of restraint, into tyranny. The crushing weight of ultimate responsibility. Having spent their fuel, the engines of creation grind to a halt.    The middle left card represents the force drawing you towards the first possible outcome. Three of Sites (Plateau of Leng): The commencement of business, commercial transactions, or employment. The constructive use of creative talents, and the expression of artistry in workmanship. Skill and labor turned to the crafting of things of value. Using the conventional as a medium for expressing the exceptional, in order to build something of great renown and glory.    The middle right card represents the force drawing you towards the second possible outcome. Page of Artifacts (Bokrug): The essence of air behaving as earth, such as a steady wind: The approach of an unexpected challenge, to be met with clear thought and just action.

The use of reason or eloquent speech to penetrate the veil of confusion and cut to the heart of the matter.    The bottom card represents the critical factor that decides what will come to pass.

UAHjJpC0aa	It's bad about your teacher  Exercises are ok, but you need CHORDS !    If there is any way,   you should find a teacher that can show you some chords  at least 3 0r 4 lessons, with the RIGHT teacher?    Books and Vids are ok to a point  but they just can't answer questions,  and that's probably what you need, right now
MkijZdIlaa	Yes, they're amazing. Except when they wake you up in the middle of the night.

X9PIqr05aa	"this is my panic,this is my call to arms"    "what a feeble attempt,just to feel alive"    "i stare so delicate and ashamed,at the shell ive shed mysself from"    "oh there acting on my words,acting on my words  we`ll start a fire and   no i wouldnt be to shure,shure of it at all  we`ll watch it burn on receptive sides"    "Make a sound it's safe for you  To choke in here alone"    "dont shake,i hate to see you tremble"    "let the light breathe some new life into this room, its what keeps you coming back"    "i know the light is blinding to the naked eye so why dont you take steps away from being alone;i swear its not too late for you"|`|W4mWzkDtaa	I've been up at this all night long  I've been drowning in my sleep  I've prayed for your safe place  And it's time for us to leave    Time is running, is running on empty and the gas is running out  I've decided that tonight is the night  That I let love aside  Full speed ahead this seems to be the place  I've seen this once before  Planned perfection sought in my dreams  Hoping this would take you home    My knuckles have turned to white  There's no turning back tonight  Kiss me one last time    Around this turn where the, the cross will cast your shadow  The people will all gather  To remember such a day where the flames grew as high  As trees  And the world stopped just for you and me    My knuckles have turned to white  There's no turning back tonight  Kiss me one last time  Shut your eyes x2    I will now bring new meaning to the word alone  Endless nights of dreaming of life  And the days we should have spent here    (Drowning in my sleep I'm drowning in my sleep)    Glass shatters and comes to a halt  I thought we'd be there by now  I thought it would be so much quicker than this    Pain has never been so brilliant  I made sure you were buckled in  Now you can walk hand in hand with him    My knuckles have turned to white  There's no turning back tonight  Kiss me one last time  Shut your eyes x2

I'd obsess about it...|`|ozmqdlEbaa	yeah. then stuff is easier to plan and you can sort of expect certain things you know.|`|oJQmzPahaa	NO! or else I would be worrying and thinking about it every day.|`|N1yMxlkUaa	i do....my birth certificate has an expiration date|`|5MeggG3Laa	no i dont think so
hg19kiKgaa	i just got back from seeing it and in the beging the girl makes out with the boy and he says he has a condom but she didn't want to do it and then the girl saw her father and the nurse making out but i think thats about it o and the girls sister drinks but it doesn't show. over all its a pretty good movie and its really scary at parts and the u would never expect the ending. i wont say thought.
AA11848792	I think you are my new best friend. Everything that you just typed is what I have been saying forever!!!    But I also like Jay-Z, Nas, Talib Kwali, Mos Def, and other real rappers    Kanye's ego is getting to be a bit too much 4 me. Pac, Biggie.    Anything with wayne, soulja boy, or t-pain turns into Sh*T|`|zQq7AhQCaa	Eminem, he's got the most style.|`|8Fn1tYaJaa	I love Jay-Z because he is very lyrical and has flow.    Common is amazing, but he's more of a poet than a rapper, like Lyfe Jennings.     I like your taste, I agree about the whole Lil Wayne thing.. ugh.. so sick of him and all the other poser rappers. Rap needs to be reborn by GOOD rappers, not bad ones.|`|E14cuDlZaa	Styles P. Hands down. This dudes the realest rapper these days and he's really coming up with his whole D-Block movement. He's a lyrical genius and his beats are something to reckon with. A true hood legend.|`|K7N0pkU8aa	50 cent, ludacris, and Slug from Atmosphere(less famous but amazing rapper)|`|SuMwWNfyaa	the ones that decide rap is crapp.|`|X7Zk82Rsaa	Kanye West an educated rapper / spiritual as well|`|x3mFm4exaa	OMG Soulja Boy is LOL.... Seriously though 2Pac, Jeezy and Plies because they are real and I can relate to their music|`|V5CLotETaa	2Pac in my opinion...I love all of his songs... Keep ya head up, gangsters paradise, Until the end of time! His lyrics really mean something which is also why I like Eminem!     2Pac   Eminem   my two best rappers    And yes Lil Wayne is ignorant, stupid, a fool... But he can rap.. You can't deny that and if you think he can't then listen to Shoot Me Down, Mr Carter, those are my fav. Wayne songs... sure his lyrics don't usually mean much but thats why I didn't add him in wit Pac and Slim Shady! But he can rap.. just acknowledging that... also Dr. carter is a good one and half that whole song is a freestyle!|`|hSpsroCXaa	Easy E - He has an extremely unique voice and his lyrics are awesome.  In-fact all of the NWA such a great rap group. (although i disliked ice cube)    Tupac - his lyrics we're legendary i tryed to stop his "comebacks" from the dead not sway my opinion of him but i couldn't so i went off him for a while.    Cypress hill - I'm really unsure why to tell the truth, they have a really different sound and i just liked the songs.    I like alot more but its 3am i'm tired and i could go on forever ^_^.    I agree with anthony all these new "rappers" sing about how rich they are and how many cars they have and how big there houses are.   I mean years ago you had to work for your money even in the music industry but now its almost like as soon as your signed they bring out The Rapper in a Box !     Contents -  1x Big *** chain  3x Big *** ring  1x Extremly slow (stoned sounding) voice.   1x No talent    and your ready to be a rapper.|`|TuuxwOcHaa	t-pain|`|VfW0Igc3aa	=]Lil wayne haha -|`|2EjZAC8daa	FLO RIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA|`|TU16BFJoaa	Weird Al Yankovich wins hands down.|`|cHuK3nuGaa	Will Smith takes the cake, and then akon|`|96wixYvMaa	Jay-Z.    Eminem.    Kanye West.    that's it.|`|8qx66ivpaa	my top 5  TI  KANYE WEST  LUPE FIASCO  NAS  RAKIM|`|Bge5zjJYaa	big|`|dpRQeob8aa	I personally would choose the Styles of Beyond, even though it is a rap GROUP. They have the kind of hardcore rap that Emimem and Tupac can't match. In second place, I put the Wu Tang Clan, for the same reason as the Styles of Beyond.|`|ZCUELzOZaa	i would say   the pack   2pac  mac dre  team knock    bay area rapers   they slap|`|JDP81Lhmaa	Kanye West|`|ehmNhHwGaa	eminem|`|DZC58db7aa	I say Eminem... yeah his lyrics are awesome and I know we aren't allowed to say because he's white.  But it is.  Not because it's his color.  But because rapping isn't looked upon as a "white person event" and the fact that not only was he able to overcome that adversity, but also kick everyone's *** along the way.... it shows a lot about who he his; determination and character.|`|SE5KO4BSaa	I would say twista because his rapping makes sence and hes one of the fastest rappers.|`|NL34mhikaa	MC Chris|`|kiHcM7Mqaa	i like lil wayne b!tch.  >.  but three 6 mafia is good too :]  oo and kanye west.   if you dont like them deal with it.  and eminem is epic too.|`|AH8ZNtwiaa	i will say lil wayne no i know what your going to say but im not its that mike jones only says mike jones in all his videos and flo rida is a one hit wonder rick ross is nasty but he is not at the level that wayne is and soujia boy he raps good but not better than wayne|`|SekvoN64aa	Common and Nas, BY FAR. Their lyrics are so easy to listen to, and they're so inspirational.    I, also, love Pharrell. His beats are sick. (: Will Smith is just all around amazing. And Biz Markie, even though he's a little not right in the mind, his beatboxing is so fun to listen to.|`|ANeRRBpEaa	lil wayne   got swag   fab  is original  nelly is fun  ja rule was for the ladies   jay -z is a classic|`|neQQ9lhbaa	***Tip because he is the best rapper alive and thats who i think is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***|`|A1yHDCwxaa	First of all, Im not really a fan of rap, therefore I don't know who the best rapper is. However, I just wanted to take this opportunity to point out that your question is quite restrictive, much like:    What is your favorite cheese?    Oh, and don't say Cheddar or mozzarella or Gouda or Edam or Parmesan. Also, Swiss was pretty big for awhile but it isn't any more, so don't say that.       Just thought I would point that out, g'day!|`|Ud8n4Lknaa	eric b and rakim, nice beatss & their lyrics are sickk, the funny part was dat rakim never wanted to be rapper cuz he wanted to b a football player and i really hate the southern rap nowadays i can hardly b listening to that shi*|`|sgTW0Hgzaa	biggie and not just cuz of the movie that recently came out i truly believe biggie was really gifted in his time and if you watched his freestyle sessions it would just be like a lyrical miracle...oh see look i'm starting to rap when i talk about him see thats how good he is    another good rapper....probably lil wayne. i mean look how successful he is he always talks about money and his voice sounds like new and the way he knows how to use an auto-tuner....just amazing..|`|aI1z8bQeaa	(No particular order & Not all)  Biggie  Chuck D  Nas  Tupac   Jay-Z  Lil Wayne  Common (I agree)  Kanye West  Eminem    They are great for being different and Talented. Lyrics are capable of being meaningful if you listen.   I don't agree with you on lil wayne. to me he is the greatest doing it now. His lyrics are out of this world and he's high as hell freestyling it.  He can rap about unimportant things but to me he's even capable of greater.   I know people who hated him (little brother) and changed there mind when me and my older brother forced him to listen to more.  Truthfully you can keep your opinion...it is yours|`|rSpJpUfLaa	Eminem    i have been listening to him since i accidently saw one of his music videos on MTV when i was 5. I guess its just what i'm used to, plus some of his lyrics are kind of deep|`|LNWlRaYmaa	The best rapper alive is Nas in my opinion no questions asked ppl could argue Jay Z and im cool with that. But as far as the best rapper right now at this current point in time i think Lupe is on a different level then most ppl lyrically. Others to be considered like you said common is ill, mos def, talib kweli, immortal technique, murs, and charles hamilton is gonna be up there when his album drops hes a beast.|`|V20PTwMmaa	FLOOO|`|4fikqmnUaa	RAP IS ****.|`|kBek6QCLaa	Eminem, not because he's white, he's the only rap i listen too, so i don't know the others,    I've always listened to him, ever since i was a little kid, and I just really like his songs|`|dfiW1IICaa	Nasty Nas|`|9SWklMBBaa	I really don't like rap. No musical value. Tch, tasteless.  The other day I had to bring in a science fair project for school, and the project had to do with music, so I brought my iPod and some speakers, so when I wasn't being graded, my friends and I were hanging out, listening to Three days Grace, Sum 41, Dropkick Murpheys, w/e, and some of the "ghetto" guys come over (keep in mind, im at a private school where tuition is 11 grand a year. I was lucky and got in on a 2 grand scholarship, so any ghettos are posing) and ask in their best ghetto voices "Ya got any rap, g" and I said "F*ck, no, rap sucks. No leave me the hell alone."  So they start fliping out until I had to dent a wall again to get them to shut up. my hand still hurts. Plaster's hard.  No good comes from rap.|`|FDEuHT7jaa	Tupac is my niggah|`|nN3mHJVhaa	Cheesus.|`|H38stfWVaa	Weezy Bby.(:    & yess im a teenager.|`|aAj4dSyuaa	I'm gonna say that Tupac and Biggie are the best rappers. They were so talented. And they have such meaning to their lyrics. It's like they were telling a story to their fans. I really do love them.|`|WpaQKpckaa	You state good points. Finally someone calls Lil Wayne & Soulja Boy out on their BS.My fav rappers are:    T.I- Because he's the only southern rapper who doesn't sound like a d-ickwad    Kanye- He does rap spoken word and he's very versatile.    Drake- He's new but he knows how to spit.    Jay Z- nothing to do with his business side; I just like how he doesn't run out of concepts for his songs and isn't repetitive.    The king to me is Pac because he rapped about his philosphies on the world and not just getting booty (although he did make a few songs)|`|i32Ew7paaa	No way!!! You like Eminem too!!!  I'm such a big fan of him!!!  OH YEAH!!!Do I need to explain it when I chose Eminem???  Yuki-Chan ^_^|`|VSsCZ2N6aa	1. Kanye West  2. Birdman  3. Chammilionare  4. Lil" Wayne  5. Eminem|`|VmXq5NCOaa	You probably won't like my answer but this "is" what I think:     "Tupac Shakur" A.K.A The one...the only....2Pac  He deserves the title as All-Time Greatest Rapper    --he raps about the truth of reality  --his message is thoroughly stated in each song  --you can't beat songs like Changes and Life Goes On  --he influenced this modern day hip hop culture  --influenced the whole hyphy movement of the "Yay"  --it's just too bad that he's not alive though    All these new so-called hip hop princes don't even know what real hip hop is. Hip hop is supposed to be about soul, expression, real floetry....not all this nonsense about gettin' thugs in the clubs and getting down with women    Nas comes fairly close but...  No matter what people say, Tupac is the legend.|`|5BBy6G36aa	Best rapper? Any dead ones.|`|DGIUaDLYaa	check this http://servedby.pollhead.com/r?p=1954&c=...|`|doVWnwJKaa	2Pac & lil wayne|`|EjfJaNn7aa	i dont really dig rap but there is this christian rap group called Grits and they are pretty good    would you be so kind as to return the favor?  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|yRbfz6Tcaa	Biggie.|`|jnr1Oh7Haa	soooooooooooooooo what should we say??
e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	I like Eminem, don't get me wrong, but that wasn't one of his tracks that I liked too much. I like the original by Aerosmith a lot better. I'm a fan of both but I was listening to Aerosmith way before Eminem came into the picture.|`|4ioDEbRpaa	Eminem`s Fack...|`|4EflpUK8aa	Wow talk about comparing apples and oranges.    Or more like psychotic rappers to over the hill rockers.    No comparison.
9SWklMBBaa	I'm not sure wether roosters and oxes are compatible in the zodiac. If they are then yes, if not, then I don't think so.

I've got records from my uncle's band, barry manilow, louis armstrong and wynton marsalis hanging up also.     Your room sounds awesome by the way.
gzERnclQaa	October/November, 9 months before >> January/February, theoretically the coldest two months of the year in the northern hemisphere.  Cold temperatures are a good time to cuddle and cuddling often leads to other intimate activities.  Then, 9 months later............|`|ZefydJ8Gaa	well i was born in december so....|`|Orx9cTJJaa	Well, my parents don't celebrate holidays, and I was born two days after Valentines day.|`|TudZYPN5aa	Hmm...    Yeah, October 8 is the most popular birthdate.    Your theory makes sense.    I was born in June...  I was conceived on my parent's wedding night... guess they couldn't wait.|`|GA5BAhaRaa	Haha, that's a good theory.   I actually know 5 people (not an exaggerated number) who have their birthday on October 24 (my mother, one of my friends, and my friends on/off boyfriend, my friend's boyfriend's grandfather, and my neighbor's cousin). Oh! And I answered some persons question when they asked, "Can you guess what my birthday is?" --Testing my theory that a ridiculous amount of people had that same birthday I said October 24 and I was right haha. :D    That was slightly off topic, but I didn't know what else to write. :]|`|YvuCN6qWaa	whoa hahahah that's smart!  never thought of that..    but i was born in december, yay :)|`|nqlk9iUCaa	Or maybe because it's Cold during Winters and..|`|X9H77A9xaa	lol, i see your point. but i was born in July|`|RL1kSvBraa	I was born in novemberr. :]|`|GYvzf50naa	Grat to know. My b-day's in October.|`|qRtYPAUwaa	Like moi?  yes I have.      and valentine's day probably is why.  or maybe the government is dousing all the chocolate with nuclear waste to make women more futile  with radioactive super babbys.
rpRupDTJaa	yes, milla had a CD called "the divine comedy"  in 1994 and she once fronted a band called "plastic has memory"    but the band broke up and milla hasn't released a CD since    but milla puts demos up on her website, which are free to download  http://www.millaj.com/music/index.shtml    plus she sings at events like fashion shows, awards etc  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2njsHE5X...    theres some vids of her singing on talk shows like carson daily    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVq1xm3sr...    conan o'brien  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwDugyOCW...    theres more on youtube and millaj.com or millanews.com
AA10262086	Sure , you can go down to an extra light set , like 9 - 42 for example. I remember years ago some guys even used an 8 gauge. The problem was they were too light and hard to keep in tune. If you wanna' go lighter then i would recommend the 9 - 42 extra light gauge set. Any lighter could cause you tuning problems. You will also need to adjust the neck relief a little and probably the action due to the fact that there will be less string tension from the 9s. Hope it works out for you , have a good day.|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	Yes you can.  Its iffy putting heavier (larger) strings on a guitar, as some guitars can't handle the extra stress on the neck that heavier strings put on it.  But lighter is okay.|`|sXerTGooaa	yes|`|WrMNnEumaa	yes|`|r4gRsr4Baa	of course!  absolutely!  yes!|`|DknMwibwaa	Yes, you may need to go to a special guitar store because they could be hard to find, they may also be more money even though they are smaller so make sure you really want them!
IJanDRg7aa	Hey! You're wrong! Now it's Saturday!|`|AA10819018	Thank God It's Friday   A business man got on an elevator in a building. When he entered the elevator, there was a blonde already inside and she greeted him by saying, "T-G-I-F" (letters only).    He smiled at her and replied, "S-H---T" (letters only)."    She looked at him, puzzled, and said, "T-G-I-F" again.    He acknowledged her remark again by answering, "S-H-I-T."    The blond was trying to be friendly, so she smiled her biggest smile and said as sweetly as possibly "T-G-I-F" another time.    The man smiled back to her and once again replied with a quizzical expression, "S-H---T."    The blond finally decided to explain things, and this time she said, "T-G-I-F, Thank Goodness It's Friday, get it?"    The man answered, "Sorry, Honey, It's Thursday."|`|abx5VNsOaa	It's Saturday here,wooohoo......,bummer i'm working soon.|`|mOarV5Q4aa	yeahh!!!! play practice tomorrow|`|hQn84sigaa	I AM GONNA SLEEP IN!!!!

But if I had to choose my fave song ff her new cd it would def be Diva!|`|y5FfKGAsaa	love both songs, i'm starting to like Halo more.  :)|`|13G12GCRaa	Well, between those two I'd say Halo...I'm tired of the radio playing If I Were a Boy everyday!!! lol|`|h5VztGDhaa	neither i like that diva song|`|bLI69sJ4aa	halo...there are so many good songs on her new album you should download it.|`|X9H77A9xaa	i like if i were a boy better|`|hG0KgHyYaa	halo |`|o8LJqzZyaa	i agree halo is way better|`|CPA2GrFsaa	If I Were A Boy|`|ngIBXfnsaa	were a boy|`|2NtogPH6aa	if i were a boy by far|`|0ct8uPw3aa	if i were a boy forsureeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee|`|tbXdgRXpaa	if i were a boy|`|U9HdoeWVaa	definitely halo|`|OMs8tKlJaa	NEITHER BEYONCE SUCKS.    She stole that "if i were a boy" song..|`|KBBBgeeVaa	Between the two, If I Were A Boy.  It is definitely a better video.|`|vmFLloloaa	If I Were A Boy is her best|`|rHjttxP6aa	Halo fer sure!!!!|`|be4housuaa	Can I like both?|`|MopFKxnXaa	if i were a boy.|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Neither.|`|Dgdmbxgkaa	I haven't heard Halo.

L0AtpuGXaa	seriously i really hate the book. I read the first two chapters, and i fell asleep it was so boring!!!!!! Its not even interesting. id understand why its a good book, and whats up with every girl wants a EDWARD CULLEN?|`|Q1o6QhyRaa	well im not that obsessed with twilight but i think everyone likes it so much because of edward like so many girls love him .And is really weird.well to me.|`|fduPrlc0aa	Its spelled Twilight.    And, it's characters are what is so fmazing to teenagers.  An average looking girl gets an amazing hot guy.  If you like a teenage love story, then you'd like it.|`|YvOm6u65aa	I don't know.    I've still to see it and see if it really lives up to the dang hype.|`|RP5NnxgUaa	I don't know what "Twighlight" is, but I do know what Twilight is.    They don't sparkle at midnight, they sparkle in the sun. It's a romantic book. Something about it brings people in. If you're going to judge Twilight, read it first.|`|FZxysdwfaa	if you read the books you would understand. before i read them i was like what's the big deal, but the book is about more than just vampires, it's a great love story? (they sparkle in the sunlight by the way, sorry i couldn't stop myself from saying that)|`|daij1eBCaa	Idk...I haven't even seen it yet. ?|`|GTja6ouWaa	I >3 TWILIGHT!!!!!    how do you the heart? is it 3 or 3> 3|`|6DmAVZMxaa	It's overrated|`|YR57a1rKaa	haha ive answered this many times to my friends  it not just about vampires its a love story, one that is perfect.   just read it :] its amazing i promise|`|rXcfimJ4aa	I would guess:    1. It actually is a good fiction book.  2. Teenage girls fall in love, oh, so easily (including sparkly vampires)  3. It's the cool thing right now    I'm going with number three mainly|`|lbmFZkDSaa	i'm wondering the same thing.|`|EFgKYxPfaa	I think people are obsessed with it so they don't appear "uncool" or "left out" or "not with the IN crowd"    Personally - I saw the movie - it was good but it didn't excite me that much... didn't build up to anything climactic - as a movie goes.    I can say this because I don't need to be with the IN crowd. I'm too old for that.|`|6gthdHpnaa	I don't see the appeal of it at all.|`|TzYCz3utaa	Oh I could think of a lot of reasons.    1. because it is an awesome book.  2. Edward Cullen!!!!!!!!!!????????????  3. Because it's Amazing well written.  4. It's a hot topic.  Vampires dont sparkle at midnight! Okay. Dude, they sparkle at night.   Read the book...you will fall in l0ve?|`|rU3H3EOzaa	Because too many girls(and some grown women,because they apparently like it too) have had a lack of satisfying,and/or exciting relationships or experiences in their lives,so they turn to a fictional character and fictional romance.It's just another glamorous love story fantasy world for them to get lost in.lol|`|hxNBgXXaaa	not sure actually x
RmcgrPMOaa	definitely a mutt - i have like 7-10 different countries in me lol|`|AA11370204	I am a mutt - German/American|`|KSq8DXlfaa	We're all mutts:) That's why racists/most bigots are really self hating, which explains why bigotry is sooo ridiculous!|`|xy9JYtkTaa	I'M ALMOST A PURE BREADDD!    i was born in france, both my parents lived there, but my dad had a little brazilian in him..  so i'm a freakin mutt.  sucks doesn't it.|`|hG0KgHyYaa	im a mutt  youre only purebred when (ex.) your like mom and her brother have you .|`|4bpBn6Taaa	COMPLETE AND UTTER MUTT AND PROUD OF IT!!!

I still haven't found loads of stuff.|`|tOd9OuNiaa	well, this once happened to me when i had to go to class, i was so pissed. it was the most important class of the year, so i could not miss it for anything, or i wouldn't graduate. i did find my keys, and luckily, i was only 1 minute late. so where were my keys? in the trash... i have no idea.....|`|gebIjqnWaa	I hate to realize that it's a sure sign that I'm going senile. It usually turns up for me, just trace back your steps for the day. It could be in the car, at school, on the bus, somewheres where you're been or simply stolen. Good luck in finding it. But yes, I do hate that.|`|8815883e2ab4555a79f3a28621142ab1aa	I'm sorry I took your jacket, do you want it back?|`|c0p2BYwnaa	Yeah and its usually because i've "mysteriously" forgot to put it where it belongs..when i start blaming people, that's when i realize I moved it..hate that.|`|wnkj0b41aa	It happens all the time! I put something down for 5 seconds and it disappears!|`|AI4My948aa	I HATE that!  My cook has been missing for a week and I'm hungry!|`|xy9JYtkTaa	YES!  my god.  well, whenever my stuff  goes missing i usually blame my little sister.  jesus one time she stole my cell phone and read all my text messages and i got grounded.  but i really hate it when you have no idea where your sh*t is, and you thought u knew where you put it.|`|AA10123022	It's because your subconscious mind places it somewhere, and then click into your conscious mind..and obviously your conscious mind doesn't know where to locate something your subconscious mind places...|`|3m4pKqIsaa	yea.. same thing happens to me alot. and when i don't look for it, i find it =[|`|kUryFgB0aa	that was my water bottles at basketball team practice    they hated me.    then i quit.    then they still hated me    who'd wanna steal my water anyway?!

Before that album everyone loved him.|`|40FNw5wbaa	This is what I believe it means to the general public, not myself. A rapper can have a great classic album and make just one terrible album and then they've "fallen off". Nas is a pretty good example. He has plenty of great albums but he fell off for another reason. He had no good singles that kept his name in the public view but he chose to make debatable statements such as "hip hop is dead". He tried to name his album N*gg*r and dissed the Fox channel calling them racist. One thing the urban music market does not like is to be preached to and it seems that he was doing alot of that which ultimately caused him to "fall off". Now 50 Cent won't even diss him! saying that Nas is irrelevant and not worthy of a diss.|`|mZOt8oURaa	He can have one classic album and he's drops another(garbage)then he fell off.The public doesn't give you free passes.You have to keep pleasing them and when you stop you fell off buddy!

So doesn't matter wat i say, depends on how people view it and how they judge it. In this case i'll treat it as a matter of personality.|`|Prm2Uq00aa	Well, what is sane?|`|ypqoFDSqaa	Yeah the world is filled with many different types of people. There are fakers, posers, and then normal down to earth people. Some people are more artistic and other are better at math. It's just life.

q4XUy0Duaa	Hell yeah!  I used to work as a busboy, and later cut hair for a few years, and you'd be surprised at how many people don't tip at all.  And when some people do tip, they act like they just paid your rent.  I've literally gotten change from people, and they stand there smiling, waiting for a thank you.    @Dominic - That sh*t is straight from Reservoir Dogs (word for word)..    @Dominic - Well, I did, and that's one of my favorite dialogues in the movie.  Haha, cheap muthafucka!  He has a point though..|`|MxhZgjXWaa	no|`|bBHlGs5waa	No.|`|zKGQL8Ekaa	When I go out and my service is what I consider good, meaning the server is polite, getting my order correct, and takes the time to check back on my table then I will tip a min. of 20% but if that can't be done then I don't waste my time.  So, I guess my answer would be no,  if I don't tip then there must have been a reason behind it.  We need to get back to good customer service.|`|OpBFc27iaa	i was a waitress for a while, n' yup..it barely happend to me, but when it did, i was pissed.    as*holes. lol.|`|c1pnGIXxaa	yes i was a server and it is the worst! if you can't afford to tip then don't go out!!!|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	It's questions like this that make me wanna over tip! For what it's worth....even though I've never been a waitress or hairstylist or anything.....I think it's rude when people don't tip at least 15%! You guys deserve more for your hard work!  Hope this helped!|`|1T2qH4mbaa	who doesn't tip?|`|uePD9IAXaa	Where I'm from we actually pay our workers a reasonable amount so it isn't nescessary to tip but I still leave a little extra if the service is good.|`|1TgIuZMqaa	man, i'm telling u..i was goin aroun 2 girls houses, given them "favours"....broke b!tches didn't even tip...like WHAT is THAT?|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	I don't tip because society says I have to. All right, if someone deserves a tip, if they really put forth an effort, I'll give them something a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, it's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doing their job.    I'm very sorry the government taxes their tips, that's f**ked up. That ain't my fault. It would seem to me that waitresses are one of the many groups the government f**ks in the a*s on a regular basis. Look, if you ask me to sign something that says the government shouldn't do that, I'll sign it, put it to a vote, I'll vote for it, but what I won't do is play ball. And as for this non-college bulls**t I got two words for that: learn to f**kin' type, 'cause if you're expecting me to help out with the rent you're in for a big ******' surprise.    EDIT:    That was the idea.  I was hoping someone would notice.

HGQWFDw1aa	Practice makes permanent.  You practice as much as you can before you hurt your voice.   IF you can before you sing take a Ricola, that will help.  Practice will always make you better. Don't get discouraged and keep your head up high:)|`|4rn3cGy0aa	take a ticket and get in line.  it takes a lot of practice and dedication.|`|2VT07B4Kaa	just keep practicing  and sing any time you can|`|oU6AODCnaa	I think practicing will definitely help you out, but I think it's also a good idea to talk to someone that trains people on how to sing.. or hit the higher notes.. a voice coach

A03NJA26aa	I've fallen asleep by accident still wearing jeans but once I wore them to bed on purpose. They were an old pair so they were worn out and I wore them because I was on my "monthly thing" and they were much more comfortable for me.

bB5d5YVeaa	I have worked for medium sized companies for many years and let me tell you, there is plenty of executive greed, even at the lower levels.    I've seen where company executives had expensive landscaping done to their homes...and charged it to the company.  And no, they had no ownership in the company either - they were employees like the rest of us.  Only they were in a position to approve how money would be spent.    Another cute tactic that these people would pull is to pump-up sales when there really weren't any.  I've seen them ship good during the last week of the year, on purchase orders that never existed.  The goods were in transit so this accomplished two things; it reduced inventory levels on Dec. 31, so the company would not have to pay a state inventory tax on the goods sitting in the warehouse on 12/31 AND it made it appear that we hit our sales goals for the year...which in turn meant that the company executives would be paid a year-end bonus.  Of course, when the customers (plural) received the merchandise that they did not order, they promptly refused delivery.  The goods came back and then sat at our loading dock for 2 months "in limbo" while the company did the annual inventory.  After the inventory was completed, they would then return the merchandise to the warehouse.    There is so much greed and pilfering at even the smaller companies that it's unbelievable.|`|luVK5cHqaa	Toooo much reading...    But I read it anyways. And yes, people are total vaginas these days.    Obama wants to give money to Africa to help with their birth control and fund abortion clinics.

lmPlSTZmaa	Please be careful buying a guitar. I have owned Squier guitars. They are not worth the money. The wood is third rate and the pickup/guitars come from a small remote asian country. The ratings you read on the online sites are from "beginners" who wouldn't know a guitar from a shovel. Spend an extra hundred or two and get a base model Fender from Mexico. It is a good start. The next mistake beginners make is buying a cheap, beginners amp. They are horrible. A bad, cheap amp will make even a good guitar sound like chump change. The guitars of the greats like Clapton, Page, BB King and so on are not beginners guitars. I started off on a very good Bass (my brothers) with active electronics and a nice 150 watt amp. Even for a beginner I sounded great. I was amazed at how easy it was to play. I ran off and bought a Squier bass beginner kit. What a horrible pile of garbage. I couldn't even sell it and get my money back. Step up. Learn on the best you can afford. Stay away from the "beginner" firewood. You will be thankful later..,.      Buy your first guitar from a music store. Not online. They can set it up for you. This makes a huge difference. Have them play it for you. See what it sounds like. Gives you a chance to check out the amps. Don't buy the cheapest cables either. I like Monster. Next, you try a few simple cords. Does the neck fit your hand? Telecasters are not my favorite type. I think a Strat is a better choice. Some beginners have a problem with the middle pickup on the Strat model. If this is the case try a guitar with a couple of humbucker style pickups like a Gibson hardbody. Avoid entry level guitars!!!!!|`|PwHQSAxvaa	The Fender Tele is great at sounding remarkably like a steel resonator, making it great for a certain sound, including rock/blues.    If this is the style you are playing, the Tele is the one for you, though maybe the Strat is more versatile.    Colour is unimportant and does not affect the tone in any way.    Guitars generally do not include an amp, though Squier do packages including a practice amp. A small one for home is adequate.    EDIT - Dark Assassin is right about acoustic guitars. An acoustic is very unforgiving. If it is played badly, it sounds awful. Master acoustic and you are doing well, but really some styles simply do not transfer to acoustic very well.|`|aFC72tLZaa	I bought the Fender Squier.  Although it looks nice, it's really a piece of junk.  The color has nothing to do with it.  I would suggest going to a music store, like in a mall, and ask questions, explain your budget, try it out, etc.|`|lgMshdofaa	try the second one, i dont play fenders but I have heard great things about the telecaster electric from fender|`|Du84mgPZaa	get the second one it has p-90 pickups but if you need a really good one get a fender just any fender|`|7sqpiGgoaa	any guitar will do if you are a beginner.... and choose the colour that YOU!!!!!! love..... if you buy a guitar in the colour that you like, you'll be drawn to the guitar more      playing the guitar is a life long passion, it will be hard to enjoy at first, but remember one thing.... whenever you start to get bored or tired from practicing.... practice or play it differently... 30minutes minimum per day practice, lots of little practice sessions is better than 1 big practice session once a week    build those finger muscles... it's all about the finger muscles, just keep working them!!    get guitar pro 5, it's a must have, you can get it for free through thepiratebay.org and you can get guitar pro tabs through ultimate-guitar.com|`|OUo9J4i1aa	1.get the first one  2.probably the colour that it is for you but that's really your decision personal taste is everything  3.just buy a small one Marshall's are the best if your wondering    oh and I'm going to make a suggestion you might ignore but get an acoustic first not an electric but once again that's your choice.|`|yK4PHCGwaa	Hello, I'm a guitar expert myself and I think you should buy the "Squier by Fender Vintage Modified Telecaster Thinline" it may be expensive but always REMEMBER:: Choose your guitar wisely and always choose the one with better quality no matter how expensive it is or, if you can't afford it you buy the guitar that has the price that you can afford but still with better quality! And another thing choose the color that goes with you, and you should buy an amp that is maybe medium sized or the small one because they're cheaper (but some depend on the brand or quality)    -Hope your new guitar removes the everyday dust on your soul.~

Cz We Do !|`|tVkHQH5haa	Just crappy police officers, If we didnt have the popo then we would prolly have the army as patrol.|`|TBIAIAcnaa	Ours are pretty good  (New Zealand)|`|oiNkygNtaa	i agree 100%|`|IWD93HW7aa	The legal system as a whole definitely has some weaknesses, but the police are not useless... I mean, imagine the world if there were no police, no one enforcing the laws... it's not a pretty picture.    And, as for the cops who pull people over for not wearing a seatbelt but don't catch murderers... they're traffic cops. That's their job. It's a bit harder to catch a murderer than it is to catch someone speeding.|`|UXOwJlHdaa	corrupt bullying failures yes but they serve SOME use :/|`|0RuNbOGlaa	First, in your rant I guess you made an attempt to say you would not issue a statement or sign papers to effect you were accosted, for fear of reprisals, if this is true, then you are the one a fault, not the police, because they can do nothing without a signed complaint since they were not present to witness the action you describe.    Maybe these rules annoy you, but remember, these rules were not made just to satisfy you but to help the public in general.    To say the police are crap just proves your ignorance, and you had better hope some day you never really need them, as with this attitude you don't deserve any help.|`|1AR6zUIdaa	yeah, they're lazy around here. unreliable and they  sit around at McDonalds anyway. one ran a stop  sign and almost ran into my sister's car.    0-o|`|vTR19mcbaa	agree.|`|tG4u77iwaa	some cases.|`|BVaCJkxzaa	Just more government workers who can't make it in the private sector.|`|vED4iORiaa	Um...no police are not useless and that is an ignorant thing to say. So you didn't give a statement? What do you want them to do if you wont give them anything to go on? Obviously you werent to afraid or you would have complied with the cops. I mean, honestly, that makes no sense, you wont give the police a statement to file in their records but you want them to protect you. You wasted their time and you should be ashamed.|`|HTrsoF6Gaa	Well I would not say that they are useless, but there are situations where they can't do much.|`|K0bCh6iQaa	The Police are worthless.|`|TgskOPC6aa	i agree i hate cops:(|`|0P4rtupoaa	I havent really had a run in with the police.  I think they do a fine job here in Honolulu.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Yeah OK remember that the next they catch the person that kills someone you love.|`|nqlk9iUCaa	We've been Robbed many times and all that, and While my Parents were screaming and going on about how useless they are, I thought, Well they aren't Superhuman. Something bad could've happened to you, but worse else-were.  Also, Be glad you're alive!|`|MVViKeYeaa	Police are just useless...there are murderers out there and they stop people for not wearing their seltbelt or such and just stop people for the most pathetic things when there are more serious things goin on in this world other then lookin more to the little problems then the big problems, i mean being attacked, mugged is just as bad!! they should take action|`|0vX8AJ0Kaa	agreed, i hate the police so much.. they don't do nothing about it and fine people very little reasons|`|5DJzp6bMaa	If you weren't Going to Give a statement or Press Charges they Couldn't do Their Job.  The Only reason They Did Nothing is Because you Made them Do Nothing.  Who's chavs?|`|w5KFkyGRaa	Both i agree and disagree. they are very helpful in some situations in others they are useless and in others they just make the situation worse.

HvtTKS4zaa	I fully agree, with the exception of the slave status.  You are right: women are superior. They mature faster, they live longer, they can give birth and can also be more intelligent and smarter  (look at all fields of education where men have impressively been overtaken!).  My wife is wearing the pants in the marriage while I am wearing the skirts and dresses, becoming her male housewife when Ill retire from work in the near future. A confident woman has to be head of the household.  It works the other way round. And we found out it works much better.    I think women will begin to rule over men within the next 25 years.  Hopefully we will not be slaves, but followers who will lovingly support the ruling female gender. Somehow like women did in the fifties last century, only tables turned.|`|SkN2NqpGaa	I bow to certain women I happen to respect, as a sign of my respect for them, but I do not worship any woman. I sure as spit will never be a slave to any woman.    Respect is a two-way street... I will show you respect, and I expect you to show me the same respect.|`|a375l0D7aa	Ma'am, yes Ma'am!

IBoHKitLaa	The ability for the human mind to make those 'weird associations' is both the root of most creativity...and the root of severe mental problems;  If you make a good association...you may turn out to be a great writer or musician;  if you make a bad or faulty association...you may turn out to be s scitzophrenic.

MrDNaxYAaa	Okay so the night Anna lit the boat house on fire was the night Anna slit her wrists and prob became mentally ill. She came back home 10 months later and still in her mind thought that Alex was still alive which in fact she wasn't. The Melinda person did in fact kill those 3 kids so Melinda prob told Anna about how she killed the kids because remember she told Anna when she was leaving "Who will I tell my stories to?". So Anna came home with the Melinda thing in her mind and kind of applied that to real life and imagined her dads fiance as actually Melinda Kemp. Anna was in a half and half world. Anna applied her senile thoughts to real life and pictured her life like that. About Anna's boyfriend he did inin factgo visit her to tell her what really happened but when he told her she was in dis-belief that she had killed her mother and sister so she threw him off the rocks. Get it now?|`|GqhygphIaa	OMG i know!! I just came back from it. I was soooo excited to see it but omg it was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I didnt think it was scary at all.

They begin to vomit all over the room and each other, with many memorable lines such as 'Peter, Hold my ears' 'I don't wanna vomit UNGGHHHH' and 'Who want's Chowder!', said by Lois at the climax of the scene.<br>  <br>  After that, the most famous clip should be a scene that has been deleted from a lot of re-issues of the DVD's from season one, during Road to Rhode Island.  Stewie preforms a vaudeville type dance and song while to the tune 'The Good Ship Lollipop' while his luggage is scanned by screener s.  In his luggage, there are guns and bombs.  Stewie picks up his bag and says 'Let's hope Osama Bin Laden doesn't know show tunes' and it cut's to Bin Laden preforming 'I Hope I Get It' ... I don't remember which Broadway show that was from.

qKOBIUrRaa	We have already been in a dumbed down society surrounded by celebs who offer no contributions to society but the public enjoyment of their stupidity so there just as much to blame as well! Not a communist ideal but an ideal of western folk!|`|T6WYXtdfaa	The economy doesn't effect my mood in any way shape or form.  Only my husband has that power.|`|6vo1S1NMaa	I have always felt the government trying to dumb us down and I think it might be getting a bit better since the Bush days but still not great    I'm kind of a fan for Socialism in some aspects but I do know that it'll probably fail because everyone is so Capitalism - obsessed and will not accept the aspects of Socialism that will probably help most of its criticizer    I also know that it will never be achieved in a good manner and will probably not work in which ever way government tries to make it work on a large scale - So I'm not very hopeful

YsQQ30YJaa	A little-incrementally. More for actions though. A relative through marriage(no blood relation) I worked for for a brief time slapped his mother so hard it almost spun her completely around. The poor woman was a little insane, not in a major way, just a little "touched". Well one day she was in the back of the guitar shop and she was kinda singing and dancing to herself. not bothering anyone. He saw her, gritted his teeth(Eric Estrada teeth) stormed back there, grabbed her by the front of her dress and slapped her with all his strength. It's a wonder he didn't knock her out. I quit that job and told the relatives what i saw. No one believed me(a kid at the time).  Years later the same guy tried to shoot me with his deer rifle. no kidding.I leveled my own rifle right at his heart and put pressure on the trigger. the other hunters around the fire all drew down on him and he left the trip and went home.  He's dead now-heart attack.  As far as words go, I try to be a little understanding and consider why they might say something out of line.|`|EnANYZPwaa	yea|`|n5xy7i2Faa	Yes|`|2H3KKuJMaa	yep. =[ and he was really amazin too until he said it.|`|iOx8mRgiaa	yep.|`|mggll8dRaa	Or something that they did.....!!|`|YW1DXceqaa	of course|`|lIQhB56Oaa	Yeah a lot.|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	Without going into too much detail yes.|`|t9htoO50aa	No not at first but if they stuck with what ever they said that bothered me in the first place I might.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	Yes, I was young and engaged to a guy from the U.S. whose family had a resort up north but still in Canada.

Then one day I heard stuff come out of his mouth about minorities, especially blacks and he fell BIG in my eyes.

letqMSoiaa	Scorpio + Pisces        Water + Water = Deluge        Scorpio with Pisces is one of those special, if not magical, unions that most of us only dream of. This is a combination of powerful but sensitive emotional energies, and can produce an overwhelming amount of uninhibited passion and love.    The love and attachment youre looking for will be manifested beautifully by the Sun sign of Scorpio connection with the Sun sign of Pisces. This is a very karmic connection.    As far as combinations of Sun signs are concerned, Pisces is probably the one most perfectly suited to Scorpio. Pisces understands your complex personality intuitively and knows just how to touch you in body, mind and spirit. When Pisces works its way into your Scorpio psyche, youll probably fall head over heels in love. And fall hard you will!     For Pisces, you seem to have a wizards touch  you can pull them back from that spiritual realm they can get so absorbed in. They often seem to be floating on Cloud Nine, in a world of their own. Your practical approach is just what they need. You can ground them, and tune their intuitive powers to that special emotional attachment with you.     When Pisces and Scorpio fall for each other, Scorpio is often able to soothe the emotional storms of Pisces inner life and help them put aside their conflicts or mental pain. Pisces will be good at using their compassion to manage your intense and sometimes sarcastic approach.     If as a Scorpio you are a tormented soul and seek love and understanding in your life, then have no doubt about it, Pisces is just what youre looking for. This is possibly why even when Elizabeth divorced Richard, and remarried several times, she ultimately went back to him time and time again. Both of them publicly admitted their undying love for each other.    Youll experience strong love and a lot of sensual satisfaction with Pisces born between 19 February and 28/29 February. They are double Pisces, and their compassionate and idealistic personalities will soothe your soul.     The karmic connection is especially strong with Pisces born between 1 March and 10 March. Cancer and the Moon have a ton of influence on these people. You could learn a lot about your emotional self with these Pisces.     Extremes in passion occur when Scorpio connects with Pisces born between 11 March and 20 March, because these people also have strong Scorpio tendencies. This is a very powerful, but also at times tumultuous, combination.|`|QmpobMj7aa	Anybody has the potential for compatibility.  Your sign has nothing to do with it.  Seriously.|`|94zi1LFFaa	pisces & cancerian are the best matches for scorpio.     for pisces the best matches are cancerian & scorpio    for cancerian the best matches are pisces & scorpio...      these are all possibly the best matches in zodiac...  my opinion based on life experience as water sign...|`|nCFnFLCDaa	idk, i dont believe in the whole horoscope stuff to tell me who and who i cannot date.|`|FDm7feRoaa	NO!

MrDNaxYAaa	Okay so the night Anna lit the boat house on fire was the night Anna slit her wrists and prob became mentally ill. She came back home 10 months later and still in her mind thought that Alex was still alive which in fact she wasn't. The Melinda person did in fact kill those 3 kids so Melinda prob told Anna about how she killed the kids because remember she told Anna when she was leaving "Who will I tell my stories to?". So Anna came home with the Melinda thing in her mind and kind of applied that to real life and imagined her dads fiance as actually Melinda Kemp. Anna was in a half and half world. Anna applied her senile thoughts to real life and pictured her life like that. About Anna's boyfriend he did inin factgo visit her to tell her what really happened but when he told her she was in dis-belief that she had killed her mother and sister so she threw him off the rocks. Get it now?|`|wbUSACpnaa	^^^^^^^  Basically what the person above me said, except the crazy serial killer's name is MILDRED Kemp.

The conductor talked and talked and talked with him, but his performance just didn't improve. Finally, in front of the whole orchestra, the conductor said, "When a musician just can't play his instrument well and doesn't get better when he is given help, they take away the instrument, give him two sticks, and make him a drummer." A voice from the percussion section replied: "And if he can't play even that, they take away one of his sticks and make him a conductor."    another joke:    Why did the chicken cross the road?  Clint Eastwood told him to get off his lawn.

KH1IG3xPaa	They are both good but system of a down is more unique and different from the rest in my opinion. They have some great songs, avenged sevenfold is a good group but there are too many like it, something about system of a down just sticks out. Their songs are just different.|`|0yVwW7CHaa	defiantly system of a down|`|C0ZiwpGuaa	I personally think System of a Down is better.Some could say this about System of a Down as well, but I think Avenged Sevenfold's songs sound the same for the most part.

The Bible reveals in 1 John 5:19 Satan is the God of this system, a wicked angel and thats why there is wickedness. Read 2 Timothy 3:1-5 that scripture was written 2 thousand years ago but is a prophecy for our day. Satans rule soon to end wickedness soon to end.

Tdld7Sfkaa	Because he was knighted by the British Empire.|`|1NPVVxW0aa	He has been knighted.    Originally this was intended as an extraordinary military honour.     For the last 30 years or so it's been an annual freakshow of celebrities and rich businessmen close to the government, along with the odd 'lollypop man' given an OBE. Kind of funny and sad example of keeping a modern royalty.    More disturbingly, unelected 'Lords' can sit in the 'House of Lords' and overturn or approve laws made by the elected 'House of Commons' (British Government), though recently the House of Lords has actually blocked many absurd and unpopular Government rulings (particularly regarding human rights).     Obviously the Governnment has a big say in who becomes a lord and it's in their interest to knight people who will not politically oppose them or businessmen who have contributed to them somehow... and plenty of celebrities...|`|PhkAdkYJaa	He's a knight, hence the title "sir" at the beginning of his name.
Fjixv6d3aa	idk i like them all
Z5mmaFK0aa	They did Damnation to take a breather from the Progressive Death Metal thing they had been doing since the early 90s. They just wanted to take a break and experiment with Mikes acoustic 70s influenced song writing and do something different.    I LOVE THE ALBUM.    WIndowpane is my favorite song with ease I LOVE that song its in many ways along the lines of what Fates Warning would have done many years ago in their early days. Many of times when I listen to Opeth and the Signature traits of Mikes song writing it often strikes me and reminds me of how similar he can be to Jim Ms song writing I think they would collaborate wonderfully on a side project or something    I would say that In My Time Of Need is my number 2 favorite and I love the rest all just the same|`|GG8x2kmfaa	I think it's lovely; like all of their stuff.|`|BGBHydikaa	Yea, I liked how they went in a different direction with it, but I'm completely satisfied with all their work. My favorite is still Burden though.|`|7fEVNng5aa	Ghost Reveries was the first album of theirs I bought, followed by Damnation. I loved the balance between growling and clean vocals on Ghost Reveries, so I was disappointed when I first heard Damnation. It's growing on me though. It has some beautiful guitar work    btw, I'm not an Opeth expert either. I've only gotten into them in the last couple of years|`|ssoZ33XIaa	I like it a lot.  It was one of the first Opeth albums I heard, and while not my favorite, I do really enjoy it.  I particularly like "Death Whispered a Lullaby" off of Damnation.

9f9160e22080d1c41de3d818930f6222aa	Dakota Fanning has done so many great roles in good movies. She was awesome in I am Sam. Abigail Breslin was great in Little Miss Sunshine, and I think it's adorable that she is nominated. However, I think she'll have to do some more movies to earn the respect / admiration that Dakota has.|`|3b87390e60b5d118b3ca6ff4d51dca12aa	Dakota Fanning. Yes I think that Breslin deserved a nomination cause she was great in little miss sunshine. But will she always play the daggy kid I think so and that's not so cute.|`|AA10978823	Abigail Breslin. Not to mention, she's just so adoreable. Little Miss Sunshine was a great movie, and I loved the scenes between her and Alan Arkin. They were so brilliant! I do think she deserves the Oscar nomination, and I hope she wins, but I am also rooting for Jennifer Hudson. I'm torn between the two of them! I just wish they weren't in the same category. That way they could both win.|`|f21547b50a9335d955acf3f0523564beaa	The Dakota fanning!!|`|fA6wiNkuaa	Dakota Fanning is amazing.

I cannot say if Abigail Breslin deserved a nomination, because I did not see her movie.

If you're a man - drive round and round in circles saying "there should be a road up here....."|`|AA12388139	If you are physically lost:  Check out your condition; your provisions; instruments of destination such as mobile phone, compass, vehicle, someone who you can ask directions.  How long can you afford to stay lost?  Will others seek you out and where should you be to be best seen or found by them?  If you are lost, why are you lost?  What happened and can it be reversed?  How did you get here?  Can you retrace your steps or path?  Check out your locality for landmarks and items that may assist you.  Where are the main roads or places or maximum travel and people?  Go to them.  What is best, to stay where you are for others to find you or to move and save yourself?  What is the danger, if any, from man or beast?  (In a city get a taxi, in the country start walking, or water start swimming).  When going on a trip always expect to get lost and try to have a prearranged plan; if taking kids to a large event instruct them of where to meet if lost.    If you are mentally or emotionally lost:  This happens more often.  Slow your breathing and calm yourself down.  Know that it is not the first nor the last time this will happen to you.  Have a drink of water, do some exercise.  Speak to a friend.  Think positive thoughts and value Hope.  When able to, analyse your problems and search for answers; use Yahoo Answers.  Whatever you cannot resolve you will have to live with, and life is short so don't waste your time in misery, go out and live.  Help someone who is worse off than you.

So|`|2807fafc4b5e72cff05ed1d7054f2a11aa	It depends on your age and where you are lost. A small child lost in a mall would be an entirely different answer than a person lost in a large wooded area completely isolated from others.    One thing to do is to assess the situation that you are in. Do not panic.Try to visualize how you got lost. That may help with your solution.      Seek the help of others if that is possible. Take inventory of what you have with you that may help you survive.    Unless you are talking about being lost mentally. Another different answer at another time I guess.

07b8313b7096ade2a84057ef85256e06aa	All voice lessons will assess you to find out your comfortable voice range and your voice type. They do it in my music school, and I am sure they do it in all music schools that teach voice too, because they would not make one sing something that is not comfortable in their range. Even in choir, we are assessed to see whether we fit into soprano, alto, tenor or bass. There's not going to be a test per se, but think of it as more of an "assessment".

wi37WScSaa	yes, it lightens the mood occasionally (:|`|dgJ4LQG6aa	Well, not me really unless I suddenly think of some hilarious that happened like the day before. And some people do it because they can't show their true emotions.|`|KQJPWWjeaa	Yes.  Grin and bear it.|`|YvOm6u65aa	Uh, sometimes.    Mainly because people ask what's up and I don't like being a downer or whatever and blab out some sob story, unless it's someone I am close to.|`|lbB4lq6Daa	YO MAN!|`|0L0llku8aa	I smile when I'm not happy when I'm being evil to this girl who won't leave me alone who used to be my friend but I made it quite clear I hate her. I'm not a mean person. That girl just makes me crazy because she always talks as if she is superior to everyone else around her.|`|BBVfRheyaa	Yes sometimes.    For living.|`|gwjBvXTbaa	Every day.    It forces me to look on the brighter side, even if I don't want to.|`|NPwOxS3eaa	I smile even when I'm not happy.  I don't want my friends or other people to get worried over me.  Plus Smiling tends to make things just a bit better.|`|y5FfKGAsaa	yeah.  "smiles are like bandaids. they cover up pain, but it still hurts."  ~|`|f4ehvRQlaa	its hard to|`|h00bqU7baa	Yes all the time. Its just a habit that I got into.|`|qVhqc019aa	Yes, I think a smile is glued to my lips..even when Im upset, I smile. I dont like people to know Im upset =/    ?|`|fwr63lByaa	no but sometimes yes because i wanna cheer some1 else up!|`|70OHpjySaa	Where did you ever get that smiling was a sign or happiness???    Do you think smiling people are really happy?    People smile because they're prettier that way than if they're frowning. They smile because they don't want you to ask what's wrong with them, because they're so miserable. They smile so you will leave them alone.    More than often, smiling means "I'm as miserable as you and please don't ask me questions about it, because I'm smiling and therefore pretending everything is fine."|`|kMBEi1Jxaa	mm yeah|`|dQ99YWeoaa	Yeah, cause I just feel worse if I frown.    So I figure I might as well put the $7000 my parents spent on my braces 3 years ago to use.|`|VF3eoUQ8aa	yes because i read somewhere if you smile a lot when you're not happy you'll trick yourself into actually being happy.  LIES!!!  you just look like a constipated mother goose!|`|eqEQfcZjaa	yes, Because sometimes in public situations i'm expected to smile|`|mIMt7ytnaa	All the time, because I don't like talking to many people about problems.|`|tG4u77iwaa	duh, it's hard though.|`|pmFFVhp2aa	Yes, I do that sometimes. I do it to make other people happy.|`|hTT8DhYfaa	yea. because i want people to think i'm happy and not a bump on a log. because mostly i am always cheery, and if its their first time seeing me, i dont want to give the wrong impression, unless i'm looking for a little comfort. :)      good question, though|`|e6wehNHlaa	yes, i sometimes smile when i am not really happy. i call it faking. like when i am having a crummy day, and i can't take it out on no one then i pretend that nothing is wrong and wait till i get home to put on the grumpy face. i do this at least twice a week. but when i am truely happy, you can tell the difference between my smiles. people usually know when i am mad and am faking my smiles and they usually leave me at my peace which is what i like when i am angry. so to answer your question...i do fake my smiles when i am angry.|`|bgE2gRwSaa	All the time....I love forcing smiles while inside I'm hurt and in agony.|`|Nc7MaBGEaa	All the time.    Sometimes, it's better to pretend like everything is okay, because then your troubles seem distant. And if it makes your friends happy, then you feel better anyway.|`|EFgKYxPfaa	I think we all have done it.  We do it because of many reasons. Keeping up appearances, don't want people to know how we really feel, don't want to cause a scene,  pride, etc
jtYL9Qqnaa	those people who ask "am i pretty" in beauty & style|`|SzHa2Uf7aa	To be honest... Polls & Surveys. Most all of the trolls are from this section, as well as the prototypical "stupid" people. I mean, the name of the section... pretty self-explanatory...|`|zMSWGHgYaa	P&S of course haha|`|c0p2BYwnaa	Cultures and Groups.. OMG..if you want to deal with racism face to face..go there..i hate that place..i stay away from there now.|`|47fd2a04a63bde240d312c215bf6c933aa	p & s  does have a lot of stupid questions    but like the adolescent section can b dumb too  like how the question "am i pregnant"  comes along  like 1,000 times a day|`|w63Ry3w4aa	Cultures and Groups  Religion|`|AUK3lzEbaa	Adolescent.   "HELP ME I'M 12 & PREGNANT!"   "how do you have sex ?"  "I gOt My PeRiOd tOdAy?"  "my bra doesn't fit!"  "is my penis big enough for my age??????"|`|OEqqeYZhaa	here can get pretty annoying. but go to the politics, and religion and your in for a treat.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Religion...most definitely.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	this one- they all migrate here at some point|`|14gi4aTvaa	Definitely Polls and Surveys |`|C2sZREuAaa	Women Issues.

Anyone who asks questions such as those..... Health/Beauty; Pregnancy   And if anyone asks both in a row like that and is entirely serious... they'll take the cake....

uel6NBOVaa	Okay, take it from an actual Libra girl. Every girl is going to be different, whether they are Libra or not, because we are more than just our Sun signs.     For me, it doesn't matter how nice or how mean or how romantic or how whatever somebody is....I usually get along with people unless they give me a reason to dislike them, but actually having feelings for someone is a different realm entirely. I wouldn't go about just looking for a girl based on her Sun sign. When you meet the right person, you just know it. You will feel it, and you will not have to think about "how to get them".  If you meet a Libra girl, just get to know her and don't come on too strongly. If she likes you, you'll know it because she will want to spend time with you. Libras may not always want to say no, but if you have a shred of intuition you'll be able to feel the difference between a yes out of kindness and a yes out of true desire to be with you.|`|jlZZbdIjaa	Use your charm=) I'm an aquarius and and aquariuses rock so just be yourself and if that doesn't work move on to Capricorns or something.|`|FVfaug1Uaa	libra girls a usually a confused mass of protoplasm.  they even dont understand themself.  but if they love you then its so easy to ask them because they ll never reject u.even if they dont love u and u r just friends so they they are not going to say no to anything.they do everything in confussion.|`|gEnWVe76aa	ha ha good luck! But if she flirts with you--don't take it too seriously, that's just how they communicate|`|Ru3Y8Mhdaa	You could write the Libra girl a poem, or a love note.  Libra women love the little things most of them are not high maintenance.  Remember that Libra is a sign of fairness, equality, and loves affectionate.  All you have to do is be nice to them, give them compliments, and when they do things for you always remember to return the favor.  They are the most easiest sign to get along with, and will do things to please you just always remember to return the favor.

19YfKNpJaa	Sure, this really isn't that uncommon.  I've usually heard this kind of thing called "nested tuplets."    [I use this kind of thinking to teach some complex polyrhythms -- like 9:8.  Play a triplet, and then make each of those triplet notes a triplet in itself.  I never show the students the notation for what they're doing, but it's the same concept of placing one tuplet within another...]|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Anything is possible    ... but might not be possible to play    http://i281.photobucket.com/albums/kk206...|`|ThKkn5fKaa	Yes, I have seen that done, but it is very rare, simply because there usually tends to be an easier way to notate those sort of things, or the composer finds another suitable rhythm that is less complex.  But if you want that whole tuplet withing a tuplet sound you can notate it like that.  Usually though, I've seen concepts like that notated by actually changing the tempo.  This involves a little math, but if you were trying to avoid making things messy, then you can change the tempo and change the measure to a 5/4 so that those 5 quarter notes would equal the length and duration of the original planned pentuplet. You'd have to figure out what tempo that would be, but once you do that it'll be a lot cleaner, especially if you intend for this to be a repeated motif. Then you could just have one of those 5/4 quarter notes be a triplet.  I've seen concepts like that used much more than I have seen tuplets within tuplets.|`|XJqPzSbTaa	Yep. The problem would be it's going to be hard to read, imagine, and play for the performer. I'd suggest you put a bracket across the top of the 5 crotchets (with a 5 marked above) and then slur the triplet quarters (and mark a 3).     I would also suggest you check that the rhythm matches what you are imagining, and see if there is another way of representing what you are trying to do. You might be able to better represent it as a separate 5/4 bar with a tempo modification causing less problems for performers.

02LqomeBaa	1. Although it's shown that Kakashi reads a pornographic (by the way called "Make-out Paradise" by the Toad Sage, Jiraiya) book, the anime doesn't reveal the books content, hence, no pornographical images or shown. Additionally, even though the idea of a pornographic book is shown, it's not significant to the plot of the story so it's not a big deal. Because no explicit idea is shown, it can pass as a kid-friendly show.    2. Yes, it's true.|`|uctxzjIIaa	It doesn't really qualify as pronographic. It's more of a trashy romance novel, like everything Danielle Steele has ever written.|`|GA5BAhaRaa	Yes it's true.  Why not, right?  Kids shows get away with so much **** because they don't expect the kids to pick up on their innuendos. :]|`|6FPpkmi6aa	The show is, if you haven't notcied, a PG-13 rated show. Also the book is in American version called 'Make-Out Paradise".    So technically it isn't as bad as you may think, in Japan it's much worse and is rated as for more mature people. But kids never pay attention to it. So it doesn't really affect anyone, it just is there to make people laugh.    It is true it is a porn book, but only in the uncut Japanese version. In the English and changed version, they cut down all the cussing and dirty stuff.     Hope I helped! ^.^    *~AnimeLover101|`|nOLVHNaBaa	1. It's not like they tell you what's contained in the book though, in fact, you don't know anything about what's contained in the book, other then it being pornographic, so it's fine. Though, the maker of Naruto DID have to ban Tsunade from drinking sake (A Japanese alhocol drink) I don't know if you got this far in the anime though, so if you don't know who Tsunade is, it doesn't matter for now.    2.True, true, true, true.|`|7UYaoeFZaa	Yes, it is true. The book is called Icha Icha Paradise. Jiraiya wrote it. Why else is he always stalking women in the baths?  Anyway, in the show it appears in Japanese and nobody expects kids to know what it means. I'm pretty sure that later in the series they started playing it later at night so it was more for teens.|`|0r3Krwpdaa	1. In Japan, it's a show for teenagers, much like CArdcaptor Sakura and Sailor Moon were. So they get away with it because, well, it's a teenagers show...    2. Yes, it's true. Well, actually, it's more of a makeout book...

RFcbLXh3aa	I would be happy in a carefree way like it doesn't really matter anymore, not happy and nervous like the first time though.    but if you like someone, you should go for it and tell them.|`|pOrwteQUaa	No hope....|`|5jqfKDdfaa	Id prolly be over it by then...when i lose interest in one guy it normally means ive found interest in another|`|N5nbOkvGaa	Mostly, I'd be disappointed/confused that he didn't notice my intrest earlier.   But I'm in the same situation right now and I took him back, so it's possible.|`|bLI69sJ4aa	unless he did something hurtful or wrong, then i would still fall for this guy|`|isosFXBdaa	i have been liking a guy for two years but i don't think he gives a damn enough to know my name|`|xHbBD8Spaa	just talk to him, not really care|`|AA10785394	really, if that would to happen, i wouldve moved on. and thats like over,   sorry|`|vLanTsz8aa	I'd be confused.      If she's moved on, she's not gonna care.  If she's still dwelling after 5 mos and praising God that you finally decided to pay attention to her, then she's desperate and you don't want her interest/hope anyway.|`|zlLSvsGpaa	I'm a girl...and honestly, just hearing his voice would cheer me up. Girls never lose feelings they have. I might be a little pissed, but if i really liked the guy, i would get over it. It could take some roses and chocolate, but eventually, you'll get there.|`|JtNylKBeaa	Unless she gave up hope completely (which girls rarely do) she'll still be excited you're talking to her. If she liked you enough initially and hasn't found anyone else to invest her interests in, she'll come back to you. Good luck:)|`|dsYE5eSVaa	depends on the girl.   some girls (not me) actually will have a crush on a guy for about a year before losing hope  the girl could just be acting like shes not interested anymore so that she doesn't look like some loser that is hanging round a guy who doesn't care.   but, hell, if she's anything like me then it would be 'whatever. i don't care anymore'  just become good friends, get to knoweach otherr, and show her what a 'great guy' you are.   THEN tell her your feelings|`|XzyfnQFFaa	Love is such a thing that it wants to see quick responses. If the other person does not respond, it is really painful.  In most cases, people lose interest when there is no response from the other side and actually respond negatively if they are approached after they have lost interest.  Sometimes there is no response because your advances are not clear enough. You are talking of this after what you think of as rejection for five months.  If he still makes you nervous after that long a period, I would assume that you still have a crush on him.  But, your response at this point of time would depend upon what kind of a relationship you want to have with him.

xLZODSqOaa	A brother and sister move into an old seaside house they find abandoned for many years on the English coast. Their original enchantment with the house diminishes as they hear stories of the previous owners and meet their daughter (now a young woman) who now lives as a neighbor with her grandfather. Also heard are unexplained sounds during the night. It becomes obvious that the house is haunted. The reasons for the haunting and how they relate to the daughter whom the brother is falling in love with, prove to be a complex mystery. As they are compelled to solve it, the supernatural activity at the house increases to a frightening level.|`|HTrsoF6Gaa	Here are some websites that might help you:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815245/  http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809922891...
oQSzZeubaa	Hello!  The problem I found in using the stock Fender pickups is that they are noisy with even moderate amounts of gain.  If you use them with very little gain, they can sound glassy and thin.  When you are playing with a full band, or letting notes run together or sustain, the noise becomes less noticeable.  I have tried various incarnations of Fender pickups, plus the Seymour-Duncan replacements; while the tone varied from just okay to fantastic, they were all noisy when used with lots of volume.  In desperation, I tried the DiMarzio Virtual Vintage Series (see http://www.dimarzio.com/site/ /pickups/ , essentially a humbucker pickup fitted into a single-coil footprint). I installed the Area 58's in the neck and middle positions, coupled with a Virtual Vintage 54 Pro in the bridge, and was treated to a wonderful balance of true vintage Fender tones and very focused and smooth overdrive (with no noise!). Even the neck position tone (which I never used previously, because it was too warm) was detailed and distinct. A new pickup will cost you $60, but bargains can be found on eBay and other used equipment sites. If you want to leave your distortion on all the time, and only switch pickup positions for the clean tone, just adjust the DiMarzio further away from the strings.  Those particular pickups tend to be very sensitive to height adjustments.  Hope some of this helps. Best regards, Dana|`|AA10262086	whats wrong with the single coils on the strat? They should give you a nice clean sound. If you are using the distortion on the amp all the time then you won't get a nice clean sound no matter what pickups you use. Try the single coil pups with a clean amp setting.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Seymour Duncan Hot, Vintage, or Cool rails. Cool rails are usually used in the neck, Vintage in the medium position. Might want to check with them (their website) for more information though.    You could also go with the 59 jr, it's a minihumbucker that's the size of a single coil!        Saul

LpR9sLSlaa	check out getting "pads" for the drums  it will cost a LOT to sound proof a room for drums  they carry thru walls|`|KFjEkOlPaa	you can't.     Buy a plexi sound shield ($400) and then install the black 1/2" thick insulating fibreboard from Home depot or Lowes ($150 for the average room). Then replace the door with a solid core door ($120).     You may want some of those studio foam panels, but they cost alot of money. Probably $1200 for a room, however, you can spend maybe $200 and put the panels on a wall that's against other rooms.

I'm a metal, alternative rock and classical music type of person. I hate country music with the white hot intensity of a thousand suns. However, from the time I was born to 7 years of age that was all my family every listened to, naturally, I thought it was the only music out there. Though I'm loathe to admit my country background, I do like the song "Strong Enough to Say No" by Black Hawk, as well as their "Big Guitar". I dislike love songs (which is the first one) and the second song is so country! But, yah, it happens.

Simon is a well-respected producer in the pop world - behind many famous and talented acts such as Westlife, 5ive, Curiosity Killed the Cat and Il Divo.<br>  <br>  Randy Jackson has played with Santana, Madonna and Jerry Garcia, as well as produced stuff for Mariah Carey and Bruce Springsteen.<br>  <br>  And Paula Abdul? She's been the choreographer for Duran Duran, Prince, The Jacksons, Janet Jackson, Kool & the Gang, the Pointer Sisters, Luther Vandross, INXS, ZZ Top, George Michael and Dolly Parton. She's also a multi-platinum selling artist and one of the top-selling female artists of all time.<br>  <br>  I'd hardly call them tone deaf - and Idol, as has been said many times, isn't just about singing. It's the total package they look for, as an artist needs to be marketable.

gKoh4brBaa	In the summer of 2003 the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. The band, understandably upset, chose not to try to re-create the stolen album, but instead started over with a vow to be even better than before. In this same year, Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring. In addition, they underwent serious "band therapy," engaging in several long talks to work out the members' differences after accusations from Dirnt and Cool that Armstrong was "the band's Nazi" and a show-off bent on taking the limelight from the other band members.|`|c68kOdVMaa	irishchik...

M8YMxfEVaa	Dear, doglover 4ever  I think that you can be a teen actress if your willing to do anything for it. I also want to become a teen actress even though I'm only 12. I am so shy as well, just like like you I'm afraid to even say my name in front of my class. I think that you should try to open up more, that's what I'm trying to do. Try doing small things like a presentation in front of your class first, then take it to the next level and try out for more plays like you just did. I live far away from you, but hey you never know we both could some day have our own show!!! HA,HA,HA  Good luck to you and wish me luck as well!!!|`|smjid35Uaa	Sorry I have no advice  But anyways good luck

It featured a giant robot with an Egyptian-shaped head, and there was this young boy, who controlled the robot with a transmitter speaker on his watch.  The film actually was several episodes of a Japanese fantasy series, called "Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot", edited together into a movie....|`|gY3sPjsiaa	What u probably saw was an old Godzilla movie...

I know it sounds stupid, but it's the only way to get over it. You don't even have to try to write music. Just write lists, what you did today, what you had for dinner - anything. You'll soon start to form ideas and turn them into something cohesive.|`|t0MiDBMEaa	Hit the town and forget about writing for the night and relax and enjoy the evening.

In the early years he could survive indefinitely in space, underwater, etc., but he got "de-powered" for awhile (like when he got revamped and eventually "killed" by Doomsday) and couldn't go forever in space.    Silver Surfer can survive in space indefinitely, so I'm thinking Surfer could carry Superman way out into space and suffocate him.  I think Surfer has too many weapons.  Surfer could probably project "kryptonite radiation" and weaken or kill Superman too...|`|720a3c208ab442188c3c8cf9ed346f7eaa	Silver Surfer would just kick ***........ his power supply is near limitless "the power cosmic" vs old supes is just a duracell power bunny juiced by the sun ....

a31kUn1Naa	I have social anxiety.    When it gets bad enough I definitely don't make sense.|`|OPqPzCdjaa	Talking fast can be caused by social anxiety because you are getting nervous and your heart beat begins to speed up causing blood to rush towards your head. If you can fix the problem it is possible that girls would start liking you but it is not for certain just because you can talk slower doesn't necessarily mean that they will automatically like you we base things on looks and personality not the way people speak

XcFgJiN9aa	When I was about 10 I got to meet Charlton Heston at my Christian bookstore. He played in the Ten Commandments. I found it so neat to get to shake his hand and have him autograph my hardcover book about scenes from the movie.|`|WMem5AGoaa	I've met Oprah during a taping of her show as an audience member last year here in Chicago, after the 1 and a half hour long taping of the show she would hang and talk w/  the audience, I simply shook hands w/ Oprah as I was leaving the studio and told her it was a great show she did w/ Dr. Oz.|`|KBCFVZVNaa	I never met any famous celebrity|`|AA11727191	We had an NFL player as our substitute in school about 2 months ago.

Oh yeah, Eric Roberts too, and more.|`|AA11640493	I met Beyonce about 6 years ago.  She was in a soul food restuarant in Houston with her mom. (Actually the soul food restuarant is really popular and they have all kinds of Destiny's child memrobilia everywhere) She was not a solo artist yet but i was already a big fan.  I tripped out and totally caused a scene.  She was nice...no security around r nothing|`|CHZd4HJmaa	Once i was in NYC and i was with my aunt and a crowd of people were in this spot and taking pictures it was Nicole Kidman or someone and behind her was a guy and my aunt thought it was her gay peuterican bodygaurd but it was George Cloney!|`|VqbIoTd4aa	I met Kelly Clarkson at one of her concerts!|`|DlAbPCtpaa	I saw Mrs. George H.

Laura Bush|`|VoFFpD49aa	I worked security in the NBC building ( NYC ) sometime in the early 2000's, they film Saturday Night Live in this building..and on this particular saturday there was all this commotion through out the building. People (employees & tourist) where scrambling around bumping into one another...you'd think the president was arriving. Turned out it was Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman coming to see the show. We had to make a path for them to get into the elevator... I said a brief hello to him, he said "hey how ya doin." she was very shy (it seemed), she didn't say anything, but she was tall and absolutely gorgeousus, she had on this long white dress that was form fitting. (tight body) My mouth was open that whole night. And every so often I'd see different cast members of SNL...but it paled in comparison to seeing those two...especially her.
Mdu9KeyWaa	None, thats inhuman..|`|OGEC7RFwaa	i don't like the death penalty. they want to punish someone, so they give them the easy way out and give them death. it would be better if they had life in prison, that way they will actually be able to think about it. and know they will never have the freedom that they had taken away from their victim.

a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	They have special effects people who specialize in this kind of thing.  For example, corn syrup mixed with dye is often used for blood.      I don't own it myself, but the DVD release of season 4 has a 20 minute featurette on how they do the special effects, including some demonstrations.|`|DUpZhTwQaa	yeh its probs fake    they are actors not surgeons|`|Uk739DPmaa	well, they just use a lot of special technology and special programs to make it look so real.  It's all fake and they would never do a real surgery on a non-reality TV show.

juraRlbkaa	Well actually I'm flattered! Ya know, I get this tingly feeling like... "OMG, am I really that sexy?"    But when it gets too far, I get creeped out!|`|iLQojxY1aa	hmmm...enough times....1 too many....>:(    i have a feeling this question is dedicated to someone on answers *looks around*|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Never thank god.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	Because gays admittedly will go after guys knowing that they are straight my answer wouldn't matter statistically.  I get compliments from guys all the damn time and as a personal trainer it can be quite awkward.|`|aJVTMHDPaa	senior year in hs...one dude was really trying to "holla" at me.    im bothered by it..|`|FgU7wYDSaa	sadly never|`|7ljzPBjyaa	this is kind of disturbing, but last spring I was on a bus and this guy came and sat next to me and started looking at me funny...  and he put his hand in his pocket with his eyes half closed, leaning next to me while beating his peenuts through his pants.   I got off the bus as soon as I could, but it was still really really weird.|`|BBVfRheyaa	I don't mind while my love is still continuing.|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	never ever thank God!!!|`|uD9vEwP3aa	haha tooo often.    it's kind of...umm..disturbing!|`|YvOm6u65aa	Once lol.     I don't mind. This person was close to me and even though it didn't work out...mainly because I'm straight, it wasn't awkward.|`|lm2ByrhHaa	Unfortunately, it seems everyone thinks I'm hot. I've had older women and younger hit on me...I'm not very nice to lezzies though, I think I hurt a lot of feelings.  I dont feel too bad about it|`|DzIlM76Xaa	Evey now n then. It's nice to be noticed.|`|62Dk8fJDaa	ALL the freakin' time...    When I was younger, it freaked me out... now I take it as the ultimate compliment....    It's nice to know I have options if I ever get tired of women.... |`|E0KjlJLjaa	with big boobs|`|AA12296351	It happens more frequently as I get older.  I guess most straight guys let themselves go as they age, so by me keeping in shape, and dressing nice,  men think I'm gay.|`|TM1kogcJaa	Once every 5 years.  It doesn't bother me.  I let them down easy.|`|cbFowOWdaa	O_O    >_>        *quietly leaves*|`|I4bALymyaa	A girl hit on me yesterday.  She was a betch, though.  I'm mostly straight anyway.

QBH92zsEaa	Yes, we feel it is imperative that all pro-life (anti-abortion) organizations take the lead to work for encouraging all such women seeking to have as many children as possible to receive plenty of assistance from Roman Catholic churches and strict fundamentalist organizations-lobbying groups.    Stop with the Roe Versus Wade protests on Jan. 22 - - take up the new birthday of California Octuplets as a day for America to defend the rights of mothers to have babies despite medical common sense and ethical debate and controversy over the misuse of the IVF technology- - do you agree?|`|F73Lyi1kaa	i didn't see my friends today, so no. did you know she already had 6... which makes this 14 kids under 7?!???
vqg6wpCLaa	Heaven's Not Enough - Wolf's Rain (all the songs are amazing though).  The World - Death Note (same here - I especially like Zetsubou Billy).  Grief and Sorrow - Naruto.   Lilium - Elfen Lied (people don't seem to like it, but it just...makes me feel.)  Living Inside The Shell - Ghost In A Shell (I do not watch the anime, but Steve Conte has an amazing, soothing voice. He also sang Heaven's Not Enough).    I tend to think that most anime music is pretty amazing. I only have two major exceptions. Two songs that I've hated...  Harumonia - Naruto (second ending. Awful.)  Naruto's 6th ending (do not know name but know that it is horribly awful.).|`|2ogFk4Amaa	I like all of the death note theme songs!|`|LrBI8U0uaa	I like the song at the beginning of the anime ouran high school host club...sorry i don't remember the name.

JbRTKDFmaa	My aunt had an abortion back in the early 80's. She was living in her car, sleeping on friends couches, and was struggling to survive. There was no way at all she could take care of a baby.     From talking to her, I know that she feels sad about it. She wishes she was able to keep the baby and while she knows she did what she felt was right for her situation, there is some amount of regret there.|`|I1K6SC43aa	Knowing you killed your child.|`|tmwOwc0Laa	You will always ask what couldve been|`|lIQhB56Oaa	It depends on the woman.  Some might not care.|`|702f83b079a03568e52b59e470049ba4aa	I would think there are many, for being raped, incest, or just unwanted.  So there are several ways to look at this.  This is a woman right and that is what we fought hard for.  Would you punish her for the man who  raped and she didn't want to carry the baby.  would the baby remind her of what had happened to her all her life.  I would think so.  This has nothing to do with anyone but her feelings.  What she is entitled to have.|`|9TtQGwfiaa	regret, guilt, craziness...|`|3ucrmVSpaa	Deep depression and regret.  Its been over 20 years, and I still regret it.  I've had 2 kids and a great life, but this is still always on my mind,|`|TvevScS0aa	REGRET.  a physical one could be not being able to have children after an abortion.|`|6j8d7TZTaa	You will never get over it but it get easier to handle.then when it is your time to go you babies will be there to let you know its alright.

If so, you may be a sex addict!|`|H1UzYl8haa	like the first thing you do after you had some guud fried chicken and some koolaid is some hot rough sex|`|AMFajJCgaa	Once a week, you're an animal.|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	I never feel like an addict til I'm not getting any/enough...|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	I'm still craving SEX, after all these years!  oversexed and under loved
rB3ypCO4aa	One of the first things that turned me into a regular in Y7 was hitting level 2,and being able to rate. I also like GETTING rated,because the 'best answer' is only the opinion of 1 person,whereas several people can give you an up or down.There are even times when I'll click on a question to check it out,decide not to answer and throw the thumbs around to all the other answers anyway! I give the thumbs up to any answer that's either funny or well thought out and stated,even if I don't agree with it. I don't give a lot of thumbs down,I save those for people who either give incorrect info or are just being negative or discouraging for no reason.|`|PuqVhzY9aa	Well, I -would- thumbs up or thumbs down people, but I'm not level 2 yet, lol.    If I could thumbs up or thumbs down people on Yahoo!Answers, and also counting other sites that allow me to give ratings to peoples' posts or comments, I'd go about it like this:    If someone has a similar opinion of mine but can also elaborate just a little to justify their opinion, then I definitely give a thumbs up.    If someone has a differing opinion(think of answers as opinions as well) and can also elaborate to justify themselves, I give a thumbs up.    If someone is neutral or lazily types out one little line for an answer, regardless if I agree with it or not, I don't rate.    If someone justifies their opinion, then goes out of their way to say something insulting or rude to someone else, I'd give a thumbs down.    If someone spams or trolls or advertises, I thumbs down.    So, I definitely agree with the points that have been made so far!|`|b4twAWp7aa	How about neither, you know I can bee like a neutron|`|0e4f865e315fc169e92917f5068a7248aa	I give thumbs up to answers I like and if they're deserving of one, and I thumbs down answers that are just spam, don't answer my questions or are clearly inaccurate.|`|ndH6W5Ncaa	I thumbs up/down to other people's answers in questions I answered.  Hmm... now that I think of it I dont think I thumbs up/down any one who answers my questions.
PuqVhzY9aa	I'm honestly so wore-out over my differentiating opinions with others that I don't really have a preference, one way or the other, if I get stars or not.    What I mean by that is, even though stars aren't really the equivalent of ratings, most often times than not I'll usually disagree with a movie rating or videogame rating for reasons usually not even mentioned in the context of either review.      So, to connect the dots, over-time I've become so accustomed to reading a review or talking to someone else that I probably won't agree with 100% that I honestly don't mind if someone finds(in Yahoo!Answers case) my question to be interesting or not.    But, I will say it makes me feel appreciated if a question I did ask was starred, just as much as talking to someone who rarely has a similar opinion as I do.|`|sav5bgzsaa	no  i just ate kfc|`|7DdH4dDZaa	Yeah dude, it's like meth to me!|`|mIw3ftlIaa	No.|`|FgU7wYDSaa	yes guilty    sometimes I write under my questions:  stars are appreciated if you liked my survey or stars are appreciated|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	No...I don't care about stars at all.  I don't really ask questions to get them anyway, but when I do ask a question I pay very little attention to stars.|`|a5565417605b533189dbbb903dc7526faa	Um.. no =)|`|fZY8EkVDaa	No I agree with you. It's cool when my questions get stars. I don't really care how many I get, I just like where/when I get them.

Whenever people ask me for flirting tips I tell them that their really is no tip considering that when some people using the tips in the magazines they just look stupid..everyone kinda has their own way of flirting.

I don't see what's so bad about being short though...I'm less than 5'2" and I love my height...|`|BZ1uvtsKaa	I grew up to very tall. by the time I turned 17 I was already 6'3 1/2  and I grew three more inches after 17.|`|AA11151670	Yes I did, 7 inches in fact. I didn't stop growing until I reached 27 years old. 9th grade 5'1". 12th grade 5' 6 3/4". At 25 years old 5' 7". At 27 years old 5' 8". I guess it helped to think positive, Always hoping to be 6 foot tall.|`|XsmPnMU4aa	After I turned 18 I grew 6 inches.|`|UoDtGtiLaa	actually, believe it or not, i am 22 and i grew an inch this year..or should i say last year 2008. I was 5'4 and in my last physical, my doctor measured me at 5'5! :D|`|5jqfKDdfaa	No...i stopped growing when i was 12...|`|brKxytiXaa	i am  i am 35 yrs old|`|FCFQRAvCaa	Everyone is different, so you can't go by what other people say on here. For example, I was done growing by Jr. High (I'm 5'6"). I was always the tallest girl in class in grade school -- I thought I was going to be an Amazon -- then I stopped growing and everyone eventually caught up to me.  :)|`|PhNAIwfYaa	lol|`|4MJEWCjiaa	When I was 17, I was 5' 2", when I was 21, I was 5' 5"....my mother also grew after she was 18 - 19.    I "started" when I was 12, almost 13.|`|cYFAo75Yaa	you maybe there. how tall is your mother?|`|xk7RX3nVaa	im not 17 or over sorry|`|7DdH4dDZaa	I'm 15...|`|HuhI1IlJaa	i'm 18 and yea, i've grown since...maybe like by an inch or so ...i'm now 5'8"...started when i was 12 as well|`|UEzTKxwYaa	drink milk|`|AA11523465	I pretty much stopped there, too.|`|pmFFVhp2aa	I'm 21, and I haven't gotten any taller since I was around 15 or 16. I started when I was 12 too, and unfortunately, I'm still irregular with that. Don't worry though, everyone grows at different rates.|`|lGWxui60aa	Im 17, will be 18 in Sep. Im short too!!!! Im also 5'0 or 5'1 somewhere around there and OMG! Im tooooo short! I want to get taller too girl, i hope i grow, they say men stop growing at 16, and women stop growing at 21 soooo hopefully!!|`|ImHWOcJuaa	Hahaa..I'm 13, and I'm 5'4 and a half =]. I "started" when I was 11.|`|aQvjsFanaa	i'm 18, i think i stopped growing at 15.|`|h5cInok4aa	nope..still a shortie.  i hear ya.   stop posting all these damn growing questions damm mit :)|`|3ucrmVSpaa	Sorry sweetie, but you're probably done growing.  "you are exactly the same as my daughter, she is now 22 and enjoys being a "little" thing.  You probably will enjoy it too when you are a little older.|`|fUo106q2aa	Well...all I can say is everyone's different. Literally - I grew about 4-5 inches between 8th and 11th grade, and now i'm 5'4" (and a half, I think), and I'm fine. My dad was short his whole life, and then he grew 6-8 inches at the end of high school and played basketball in college. my sister is 5 years my junior and already 3 inches taller than myself...    Yeah, everyone's different. I for one am grateful to be the height I am, and I'd be perfectly fine if I didn't grow another inch.  Who knows, you're still young - you stop growing sometime after 20 anyway, so there's still a good chance you might grow some more.    Don't worry; be happy  -Pisces2222

jN0njYgjaa	Shell probably will kill u cause of the crappy emo "bands" and your pitiful musical taste.|`|m5Qh7gYraa	There is a reverse day care at warped tour.  Its a place where parents can hang out while their kids rock out.  Its a tent with misters and a big screen and free water and diet pepsi's.       Just be happy your mom is letting you go.   She wont be the only parent there following around her kids.|`|veeIbyV4aa	DON'T GO!     I know it sounds like alot of fun, but I if were you I would just wait a little longer until you can go alone with friends.

It'll be worth it.    The first time I went, my mom came.    She just hung out at daycare and talked to other parents.

FTkyR3kIaa	Dude kanye rules,no matter what anybody says. All his cds were good especially 808's & Heartbreak and College. Bests songs by him Paranoid,Robocop,Through the Wire.|`|KoNHUcNUaa	He was good when he wasn't so cocky.    But fav song is -Two Words with him mos def and freeway|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	My favorite rapper.|`|aJfBtT9iaa	hes ok    fav song- family business|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	He's an arrogant conceited untalented bitc*.  Idiots like this should be sterilized and not permitted into the gene pool.     But that's just what I think of him.|`|GxLpWJZNaa	he was name the hottest mc in the game by MTV but he realy isnt that good his latest album sucks. I hate lovelockdown and my favorite would be good life because t-pains on the hook.|`|mZOt8oURaa	None of them!He's gay and so are you!|`|khM3eZnZaa	I love him. He is an amazing artist :-).

I guess I'm ind of a bias vote then :-(.|`|InCpu9Vfaa	heartless|`|CqVm9Y5faa	wat do i think of him hmmm. the same thing i think about every rap artist. fags with no taste in music that pretend to be tough **** but arent|`|OpBFc27iaa	hey used to be allright, i think he just needed to stick with what he was doing.    all falls down  family buisness  slow jamz  through the wire.|`|t395RWhGaa	I don't really listen to him that much although the few songs I heard from 808's and Heartbreak sucked  I guess my favorite songs would be Stronger (because Daft Punk is awesome and Kanye's rapping alright) or Classic (mainly because it features Nas, Rakim, and KRS-1 who are 3 of my favorite MC's of all time, I guess Kanye's verse is alright (he sounds tight in the hook though))|`|YWb2GmjXaa	I like all of his music-except most of 808s and heartbreak.|`|2UT79f9Jaa	i like all of his albums including the college dropout probably my favorite one from kanye but his new album is good but i think he should go back to rapping without the autotune on his next album|`|HL8W9yU6aa	KanYe West is one of my favorite rappers, he's around number 30 on my list. He's pretty good as a rapper but even better as a producer.  My favorite song of his where he raps is Two Words. My favorite song of his where he solely produces is Good To You on Talib Kweli's album "Quality"|`|iy8C03vaaa	I HATE KANYE WEST...HE IS THE MOST OVER-RATED ARTIST EVER!!!!!!!

My favorite song would have to be.....Through The Wire.  His first song.|`|VYGt0PCdaa	kanye is sh*t on crack but i love his music my fav song is hay mama and hartless|`|LINEfEPpaa	my favorite song from kanye is Heard em say and Last Call|`|AKwebzdUaa	When Kanye isn't bragging about his money and jesus piece. His lyrics actually have meaning, like the song "Everything I Am" off the Graduation album. Spaceship off "The College Dropout", or Black Music off "Late Registration". Those are just a few titles off the head.    Hell even "Heartless" is a hell of a deep song, even with that gay t-pain voice. I can relate to his lyrics, most people will disagree with me but it's okay.|`|g3HrRmaCaa	My favorites is the entire 808's and Heartbreakz|`|lDC0PNFTaa	college dropout was his best album, in my opinion.|`|qC6ZiU5naa	Im just waiting till he goes back to rapping.    Favorite song?...."Two Words" off College Dropout|`|EnIHwlT1aa	gold digger n stronger
InCpu9Vfaa	yea    somethin different     he could do both    hes talented enough|`|tSWfx5EBaa	Neither. He should record a nonexistent album.|`|QvcJVoE2aa	well lil wayne is a fag, so he is copying run-dmc and jay-z making a rock album thinking it will work for him. this would work but he has no talent at all. also all of his fans are white so they will probably like it. and no he isnt doing the right thing he isnt good as jay-z so he is going to fail at it . and doesnt matter what he does its going to just be another piece of crap|`|OmJdN2smaa	i like it better when hes doing rock|`|1TgIuZMqaa	call me crazy....but i personally liked "prom queen" it worked 4 me      so my answer is why can't he do both?|`|QWfyOnRMaa	LIL WAYNE SUCKS. nuff said.|`|K4gH8gnmaa	he's good with rap, he should stick to it|`|BnTYoxUIaa	none|`|rfWxuJ6iaa	I honestly think he's good both ways =)|`|XkJfs2l9aa	i think he should stay with rap, personally.|`|nGPGl2Graa	I think he should just stick to rap his voice cracks when he raps so in rock it would be worse.|`|eAJdebamaa	dont' matter.  whateva he does it's gonna sale big.  he stackin.|`|efcf44a473f339a55ec6342ef8170916aa	he makes pretty decent rap songs..so im thinkin he should stick to rap :]|`|q6yJKulWaa	He needs to quit both. using a synthesizer for your voice is not talent|`|Bha2LLxAaa	i think he should do rock and also rap because he sounds good both ways. yes i will buy his album  (the Rebirth)|`|BgJnoIAXaa	well....both i like the song a millie and let it rock!|`|yONMnNKAaa	neither...i used to like him but then his music started to turn me off....but if i had to pick rap....|`|zuyW98pyaa	lil wayne doest use a synthesizer he uses auto-tune. let it rock aint his song its kevin rudolf's. prom queen is tight.|`|ogFRi7wMaa	lil wayne is good wither way. its not "him" personally that you should worry about. whether he does smoke and codine, that his own problem and its not out there for you to judge him on. it's his lyrics that really matter and his lyrics will always be a hit no matter if he sings it to a rap beat or rock. so to all you people who come on here to talk **** about lil wayne on every question that is asked, seriously go find a new hobby.|`|B0LEWK0baa	First Of All!!!!!! It's Not A "Rock" Album.  It's Just More Stuff Like "Let It Rock".    He's A Rapper....EOS.|`|KoNHUcNUaa	Ok I know all the lil wayne heads are going to thumb down this but sorry Lil wayne doesn't cut rock music. He can't sing, using auto tune doesnt mean you can sing. Lil Wayne thinks because he's so famous now he can do whatever. Every man needs to know his limits.|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	Everybody knows he's a better rapper.    But I kind of liked that "rock" song he came out with.  It was alright, for trying something different.|`|mBQQL0kCaa	rap|`|ioNTTqKfaa	I think he should switch entirely over to rock so people will no longer associate him with the hip hop genre.|`|Belb1stLaa	rap.    i mean it all depends on what he wants to do i mean he is making the album.    prob. not.|`|7a5900dd33706d6ef39661952113f6deaa	The n*gga needs to take a break, he's getting more wack with every passing day.

The flowing robes, the grace, bald... striking. So, I'm on the first tee with him. I give him the driver. He hauls off and whacks one -- big hitter, the Lama -- long, into a ten-thousand foot crevice, right at the base of this glacier. And do you know what the Lama says? Gunga galunga...gunga -- gunga galunga. So we finish the eighteenth and he's gonna stiff me. And I say, "Hey, Lama, hey, how about a little something, you know, for the effort, you know."

RKMWeMk9aa	Snoop Dogg has pretty good credibility and I don't mind him doing it at long as Ja Rule or Soulja Boy aren't involved.|`|JXTLpgUoaa	Its heresy in the same respect that it would be heresy to turn that song into Muzak.  So I guess in a way Rap is kind of like the elevator music of the 21st century.  Kind of pathetic, really.|`|G2ex4HYuaa	that song rules!snoop was definitely paying his respect to the doors..maybe he made some of these kids curious about the doors music, helping to expose them to a whole different sound, keeping the music alive!especially since snoops version was good..|`|hll0pvC5aa	he had no right to go and do that to a band as amazing as the doors|`|Ju1skLb8aa	I LOVE Jim Morrison and HATE Snoop Dogg.

Nothin' up mah sleeve,...    ...and with the cry of "Alley-oop!", the mighty moose muscles flexed and threw our diminutive hero, Rocket J. Squirrel, up, up, and onto the wildly veering moonship. Inside, the two moonmen, Gidney and Cloyde, lay scrooched with their own raygun, while at the helm, Captain Peter Peachfuzz tried to remember which way was up.     Observing from a telescope from a craggy tor in Pottsylvania, the two villains, Boris and Natasha, were gleefully observing the hapless moonship.    "Me-heh-heh-heh, Natasha!, the moonship is looking like a pancake with motion-sickness! Soon will be big explosion, and we have our own cartoon show!"     "Vat vill ve call it, darlink?"

They also treated me bad.|`|YZ0Z7litaa	no i'm not like a stupid lifetime movie...  but i have let guys take advantage of me ... somewhat in a way...|`|AA11369490	hell no|`|mVPBkUWSaa	I'll put up with it for a little while, but I'll tell him to stop. If a guy is still being a jerk I'll tell him straight up to leave me alone and that I won't take it.|`|5mIhU9KAaa	no. when they do i get in there face about it or just ignore them|`|6E2hEzOXaa	it depends on what I want... If he is seriously being a b--stard then I'd break up with him because I come from a "don't take it" background, but if I was being a well you know and he is simply putting me in my place.. then I really did deserve it... If we are talking about a man just being abusive, hell no! I'd ditch that loser.|`|CZxew9Hgaa	i hate that about guys.i can't find a descent one.|`|CuSvCNrpaa	I have been treated like crap all my life.|`|FMiCHxHgaa	No way. I'd never let anyone treat me like crap, no matter who they are.|`|FNwxcBPpaa	No to both|`|SzHa2Uf7aa	Guys who treat others like crap aren't worth my time of day.|`|pOrwteQUaa	To bad im not allowed to say anything XD
gJhwH335aa	If popularity determine the price of the manga, Naruto would cost $50 for each tankobon (manga volume) XD    Just save the money, it's not like you are going to buy manga every day isn't it? Besides, you still have the time to save your money in between the released because FMA Vol 18 hasn't released in US yet right? >:)    I don't think they are really that expensive though. Urgh, all of the sudden I remember that I bought DBZ VIZBIG manga edition and regret to ever buy that manga. I was fooled by the statement "Updated content! Colored page!" Whereas it is still the same and only couple of the chapter is colored >__    Don't make the same mistake like me though XD Unwrap the book first! I was wondering about the collectors edition because they said the edition is full colored page. Hmm... perhaps I should unwrapped it first.    Speaking of unwrapping the manga, see what kinda 'extra stuff' they put on that particular manga volume. Some manga are worth buying because of the extra stuff compiled together in tankobon released.     E.g     - The extra stuff in Naruto isn't really that interesting because some of the volume only compiled a plain boring Kishimoto life that you will most likely find and read it on the article over the Internet.     - FMA is interesting and worth buying because they usually have extra chapter and comic strip that you can't read over the Internet.     - While some manga don't even have extra stuff in it.     Sometimes, I make a decision and choose to buy the particular manga because of the extra stuff they compiled together. Stuff that you can't find from online reading. Perhaps you can do the same so that you won't regret to ever start the collection later in the future.|`|0znTxgFpaa	Haha, yea i hear u, wish i cud afford 2 buy mre myself.   i think its just that only a couple of manga books get released each yr, so they try to get as much 4 it as they can.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Its not that bad. Its only $10.99 :)    Just save your money or something.
XiYLKF8Saa	Gotta go with Blitzburgh and the number one defence across the board. Other than Larry Fitzgerald and Kurt Warner Arizona don't really have anything going for them, no run game(suspect at best), lousy defence and Larry Fitzgerald is their passing game.     As far as Da Bears goes, I live here in The City of Chi and watch most of their games. Until they do something about that offence like get some quality recivers, get rid of Rex Grossman dumbass, rebuild that front line It's not going to happen especially with that tired defence and allow Devin Hester to return kickoffs and punts instead of just punts.    When it comes to Prince of Tennis, I'm not a fan of tennis so anything tennis related including my preference in anime count me out(sorry I'm just being honest).    New England has a good shot depending on how healty that knee of Tom Brady will be after tearing his ACL Tendon. New England goes as far as he can carry them.|`|6X9v2mciaa	EHHHH??!?!?! SCREW THE PATRIOTS D:    *spits on chou's team* >:]    lol~     i have my hopes for the Cardinals coz i dont want the steelers to win their 6th Superbowl title-- (thatll make them in the lead & the Cowboys will be behind by 1 title    & thisll be the Cardinals first Superbowl title~ w00t! (but the chance of them winning is not in their favor v___v)    [[edit]] AH!! forgot this~    AQ:    ive only watched 6 eps... & that was about 4 months ago i dont remember any of the charries  : /    [[edit]] =.=" so i made myself look like an idiot then-- wooo....     well who IS your fav team??|`|U0FgxEJxaa	I hope that the weird thought in the back of your head is right:  I would like the Cardinals to win.  Not that I like Kurt Warner all that much, but I would like to see the underdog make a blowout of it.  I think the Steelers would have something to say about that, but I still would like to see Arizona win the Superbowl.    Anime Answer:  Dang, I can picture him, but I do not know his name.  I am kind of out of it today.  Sorry Chu!|`|v1hCymAEaa	I'm going to say that the Steeler's are going to win, the Cardinals seem like the underdogs but hopefully they can pull it through.     Anime Question  >> Who's your favorite Prince of Tennis Character?  I like Fuji.    :-P|`|btFSgJmlaa	I'm saying Steelers.      Why?      I think Pittsburgh is closer to my home state.    Also, Black and Gold, Kick @ss colors.

Anime Question  >> Who's your favorite Prince of Tennis Character?    ~~~None, I don't watch it.|`|9SWklMBBaa	I'm a New Englander, so after last years let down, I'm not going to take a side until after it's over XD. jk.  I don't really know. I'm going sking 2morro so I don't know if I'm even going to watch. I'm not a big fan of football anyway. I just go for the food.|`|fJR4nyKqaa	I personally like the Cardinals. :D    As for the anime question~    Ryoma Echizen. ^__^|`|fwBIXZxPaa	Steelers. (I live in Pennsylvania. ^_~)    They better win! I bet my friend $0.10 that they would!    If they lose, I'm going to have to go look for a dime. And I want that money! XD    Anime Question  >> Who's your favorite Prince of Tennis Character?  >> Never watched it.  =P|`|rSpJpUfLaa	Eh.. since neither the Cowboys nor Patriots are in, i don't care so much. Steelers i guess even though Cardinals might be better?    Anyway just in general .. patriots! w00t    -Anime Question-  Ryoma Echizen probably|`|6FPpkmi6aa	Cardinals, why? Cuase my whole class says so, and I think so too. So deal with it, jack@asses.    Anime~    I haven't watched it yetm but whatever one you like I'll make it my fav. too.

3N2ElzcQaa	Classical music for me :)|`|1vCoaf08aa	Thrash, I love Megadeth    My first is rock, which belongs to CCR/John Fogerty.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	Thrash metal.

My first favorite genre is power metal.|`|dfiW1IICaa	parody lol|`|HRQjffv8aa	Slow Rock|`|9SWklMBBaa	Well, my first favorirte is emo rock. I guess my second favorite would be a tie between alt. rock and metal|`|VmXq5NCOaa	Second favorite...hmm....that would definitely be..........basically "anything" except country music|`|l9uGrfSYaa	Classic/OST music (music made just for a movie or show). So I guess you would call those symphonies.     nya nya|`|MDsUNZIHaa	punk rock...  haha...|`|U0FgxEJxaa	It is a tossup between Jazz & Classical for me.

MQ: Cemetery Gates|`|9RTuRPviaa	Oh thank you for not giving the link, i probably would have gotten really angry.    bq: I know i bring it up all the time but i cannot get over How Soon Is Now? by Snake River Conspiracy. What a load of crap that was! And the idiot girls i was friends with at the time it came out thought it was the best. song. ever. Better than the original, one argued!!...its honestly part of the reason i'm not friends with these girls anymore.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dwut5OI4...    mq: Cemetery Gates|`|BZ1uvtsKaa	here's a horrible one:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ6LeWEYg...    MQ- Death Rattle|`|6EoAKcMwaa	I refuse to listen to it.    BA: Celine Dion "You Shook Me" by AC/DC - it may be the worst cover ever! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FONt47Z0K...    MA: "Cowboys From Hell" and "Walk"|`|372458a63fdf2cfd5035da966e6ddf39aa	Yeah, I saw that once too. I think I went deaf for awhile afterwards.    BQ: Avril Lavigne covered Chop Suey once, you'll regret clicking this link...  http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=av...    MQ: By Demons Be Driven|`|8jSsGfUXaa	I mean just because its Fall Out Boy doesn't automatically make it a bad cover. It sounds pretty solid, I mean, I'm not amazed but whatever........      Bad Covers: Avril Lavigne- Fuel  Favorite Pantera Song: Hollow (That lead gets me everytime)|`|7lDSkGLTaa	BQ: Dunno  MQ:Ill Cast A Shadow?|`|rRCTvT7Saa	BQ:  Mariah Carey's awful cover of the Badfinger classic, "Without You."  I believe Clay Aiken also did an awful cover of that song.    MQ:  I honestly can't say, due to the fact that I'm not a huge Pantera fan.  I don't think I know anything other than "Cowboys from Hell."|`|CTQNPj56aa	I think I just killed myself!    BA: Avril Lavigne's cover of Joan Jett's "Bad Reputation"    MA: either Cemetery Gates, Hollow, Floods, or Shattered     R.I.P Dimebag Darrell|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I HATE WHEN NEW BANDS DO CRAPPY COVERS!!!!!!!!!    rant over.

MA: Hmm, can't really say I've heard much from them.|`|Inc78M0Raa	Probably the worst one ever is Flyleaf covering Teen Spirit.  It was so horrible.  She just ruined it.  And she looked like she was stoned while singing it.|`|98GbovYTaa	oh yeeeeaaaaah..i like pantera but i'm ashamed because i don't want to be seen like some random metalhead or something  favourite pantera songs are ...walk..obviously  cowboys from hell  THIS LOVE  hollow  living through me  psycho holiday|`|Gy5OV6CZaa	Yeah I heard that a few months ago and thought "What the **** is this ****??"     Flyleaf's version of "Teen Spirit" has haunted me since I first heard it.|`|78b5703437578d17b98b61d3eb944356aa	i honestly hated the maine covering akon, it was awful, that song was meant to be fast and dance like, not slow, it isn't a love song and was not intended to be one|`|DUg8MRkqaa	Wait a minute Fall out boy a pop band covered a metal song?    Oh i get it Pete Wintz wants stronger dudes outta the metal scene to anal f*ck him    I cant do it dude all these horrible covers hear ill lighten the mood    My Fav. cover songs:  Enter Sandman by Motorhead  Cat Scrath Fever by Pantera   You Really got me by Van Halen    Fav.Pantera song  5 Min Alone  Im broken  walk  Psycho Holiday  Revolution is my name  Domination  Drag the Waters  Mouth for War  Cowboys Frm Hell  Goddamn Electric|`|AIhL8wLkaa	BQ: Fall Out Boy's cover of "Walk" easily...

I thought I would let you know because of your name and your picture, hehe =D!|`|wOc4Dqllaa	Oh God. That was repugnant.     BQ: Avril Lavign covering Imagine was blasphemous. Avril Lavign covering Fuel (Metallica) was horrendous. Avril Lavign covering Chop Suey was unbelievably disgusting.    MQ: Domination.|`|WU4MHq3aaa	wow... that just makes me shiver    BQ:Celine Dion's You Shook Me All Night Long.... this made me laugh... and then immediately after... cry    MQ: COWBOYS FROM HELL!!!

g1sB7Zi4aa	I always buy american made if I can!  It's usually more expensive (idk why) but I'm willing to pay a little more to keep jobs and money here!|`|HsggAt0Waa	American made means just that ! Means american jobs. HHHHMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wounder if we kept production in the us would we be in a economic crisis right now?????????????|`|cZypvAK8aa	It is good for the country's economy. Unfortunately many products do not have an American made equivalent so you have to buy imports.|`|hKVh1EIcaa	buy american made but it is rare that it is made in america|`|71VRvldJaa	It would be good if you can still find anything that's american made!|`|89FgPZ9Waa	Yup. it's good.|`|LEBV1FPuaa	Buy American it creates jobs and email your senator in support of the buy American provision in the stimulus bill.|`|m3pFnkb6aa	made in America of course.|`|Zlzdo2yoaa	Be American, buy American|`|rQ7UTtu1aa	good is better Quality|`|h00bqU7baa	Yeah I think its good too. No shipping from very far away.|`|6WQo6RpSaa	Buying American stuff helps give the economy some support, which is something the economy needs right now =/|`|FttPArZ7aa	Pros:  -money stays here  -better pay= most likely better quality than the sweatshops in china  -no child labour    Cons:  -more expensive to produce  -has to be able to compete with foreign made prices  -much of the profit goes to payment for the employees.  -THE CARS.|`|AA12278670	It's not bad to buy American unless there's recalls... ;)|`|e6894a4cbc6e299276d8fc7fdb4c6a5eaa	Yeah. Too much America money is being spent on foreign-made products, which results in too many imports and not even exports. We should also be selling all of our products to the rest of the world.|`|oM4zGNCHaa	Depends    Cars? No way!      Imports > American|`|hu8o4vomaa	It is good for me to buy the best product. Sometimes that product is made in the US, sometimes it is not. I mostly buy American, and even local; that is not always feasible.

a1Ngi39Xaa	Meet Joe Black.  I just love how he is able to act in that as if he is experiencing things for the very first time (peanut butter, tying a tie, sex, etc.) and I love Anthony Hopkins too and the way they interact.  Claire Forlani was awesome in that movie as well.  I know it's a long movie but I love it.  My Mom even liked it and she is in her late 70s!    Legends of the Fall is up there on my list as well.      I didn't think Mr. and Mrs. Smith was that great.    I haven't seen The Curious Case of Benjamin Button yet but I will do that for sure now!|`|tLI94qWNaa	I love him in the movie Interview with a vampire|`|Y5032C2laa	troy great movie i must say actually i just watched it today haha|`|5135834c90cc2c12523172c90a0e1a7eaa	Seven and Interview with the Vampire  oh and of course  Fightclub!!|`|Mwbafje3aa	"Legends of the Fall" due to the fact he just looked so fine, hot and amazing in that movie.  In my opinion, his long hair made him an Adonis to me!!!  I still dream of him in that movie.......sappy and, yes, a bit sad, but true!  I wish all guys looked like he did in that movie.

6fxr3VBGaa	Only Built for Cuban Linx    I liked the Mafioso style and they[wu-tang raekwon rza] were the first to come out with it. I mean Doe or Die, It Was Written etc. A lot of east coast came with a somewhat mafioso type feel for an album/song/lyrics but that was the first.|`|zVdNQowNaa	All Eyez On Me|`|2Mvrxdn7aa	I will just say warren g - g funk era.........most people should know if they are TRUE rhh listeners    no disrespect to the ? bonnie, but my hands are tired, LOL!!!|`|cMHSpGXWaa	ready to die   so many lines were borrowed from that album|`|ioNTTqKfaa	I have two. Illmatic and The Chronic. The Chronic influenced the entire musical style of the 90s. Every album was G-Funk after that. Illmatic brought back lyrical rhyming to the east coast.|`|q0rDcTSRaa	Illmatic and Ready to Die    Good Luck|`|59Snm0JSaa	the chronic. no question.|`|FAaePWPWaa	Ok I have three albums. Because I had to narrow it down. I think Biggie's album Ready to Die. It was his best album. I think of definately  influenced every rapper to take it to the next level. He influenced Jay-Z of course because Jay-Z cites Biggie's lyrics in his music    Then next would be Pac's album All Eyez On Me. This album propelled Tupac to the next level for real. The song that everyone would recgonize as a Tupac song is on there and it's "Changes". And he has more great songs on that album. I think Tupac influenced a lot of rappers.    Last but definstely not least Jay-z's album "Reasonable Doubt". That album was fire. When it came out it wasn't as acknowledged as it is now. I believe that album was foreshadowing was yet to come by Jay-Z.|`|uePD9IAXaa	Wow such a tough question. I mean really you have to look at what sort of influence. I mean we've all heard how Nas was influenced by Rakim so where many artists after Illmatic influenced by that album. Was it the Chronic because I read an article which Biggie said he saw how everyone loved The Chronic and Doggystyle and so he wanted to make Ready to Die just like that. Or perhaps it was the Wu's debut classic Enter the 36 Chambers.    Personally for me I think it would be an album out of the East Coast because I'm not from the US so I was influenced by what I could hear and generally for the most part that was West Coast stuff out of L.A. But when I started to listen to East Coast stuff the vocabulary and the elements of Hip Hop were much more prominent and really enlightened me to the bigger picture.    I'd like to say it was something like Gangstarr-Hard to Earn or maybe something out of Diggin' in the Crates.    For most rappers in general it would have to be one of the higher grossing albums. The sort of album that gets respect and sales.
zlPAVkUBaa	Who cares?|`|vYs5j3Xnaa	I don't know, but you are cute .|`|0cf4Qja5aa	Gi:    Ok!  As a bemused observer I can be objective.    Boy 1 looks half in the bag already and looks like he is in need of another drink before he will feel up to dancing "Tango" with some one like yourself. Don't let his insecurity fake you out, this guy is not ready for what you have when the heat is turned up.    Boy 2 Seems comfortable enough in his own skin to allow his buddy to fain sticking "?? in his ear".  Now, that tells me he has a sense of humour, he is well grounded in his own sexuality and he dosen't seem so hung up on himself that he takes himself so seriously that he needs alcohol to get up enough nerve to "Tango" with the likes of yourself.    Finally you and the other girl are terrific looking and although not "Tango" I'd be happy to Salsa dance with either of you anytime, anyplace.    He looks like an artistic type and you'll really make each other look great.    You on the other hand have Mischievious eyes and look like your are "locked and loaded and ready to rock".  Now you know you've already make your decision and which ever one you choose, I know you'll make him a very happy lucky Boy!|`|V780bRMRaa	Boy Number One|`|INf502UUaa	. . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`    Go back to beauty and style.

But I guess they would    I assume that the people with blue eyes in their avatars either have blue eyes or like blue-coloured eyes  and etc. so I guess they'd assume things like that about me

The elevator crashes with me inside. In the dream I felt the pull of gravity while going down so fast. It was a little scary and astounding. When the elevator crashed I also felt the vibration of the crash, it was so vivid. I felt death, the numbness and yet I felt very much alive to experience the feelings that go on even after death. It was a wonderful feeling!! That day when I woke up I felt so weird and I felt that some part of me has died. I think that was meaning that a part of my ego has died, some old pattern has been removed so that a new could be built and so that self could be more free with the less hold of ego. Dying in the dream didn't feel at all bad actually. I did get shocked for a while but after taking a few good deep breaths I was fine and 'happy'.|`|VANst1KRaa	I had at the time of my birth .|`|HlKoGQGNaa	Is started out with my dad.

Ok.. you stand alone...|`|oDGttkmLaa	Ugh..I was looking at a Q a while ago and it said "Are you an online stalker? Like do you email people 24/7, star and answer all their Q's and ask them where they live?". It was kinda like that anyway. And in my mind I was thinking "Fuuuuuck, I AM a crazy stalker" ..and it made me sad.  Now I'm afraid to email anyone. ANYHOW, you don't come across as a stalker. And if you do..anyone would love to be stalked by you.|`|DzIlM76Xaa	I was just complaining to my fish that you don't stalk me enough. I wouldn't say you're weird. You're "eccentric".

Are you stalky? No, and I am a little disappointed. I would LOVE to be stalked by you.    Actually I do have a contact who sorta stalks me. If you go to her page of answered Q's, it is rows and rows of me. I find it funny, in a "I'm flattered but I would never tell you where I live" kind of way...|`|83dc622a9447fc8c5ffba386894737ceaa	Yes.     No, it is not you, which is somewhat disappointing.     If you want, you can hide in the bushes outside my house, call and listen to my voice, or send me creepy emails. I will act surprised.    Let me know if you have any stalkers you want to be rid of, and then consider it done.    ;)|`|hu8o4vomaa	Yes I do know someone like that, but it not you--although you do look a bit alike.|`|tQUTJxCsaa	Weird and stalky is so subjective these days.

X9kNbpnQaa	I would say Code Geass. It's got a controversial ending, with Lelouch either being dead or not. On one hand, he got stabbed. On the other hand, Nunally had that vision when she touched him. The only time that happened was when people touched someone with the Code, meaning CC could have given her code to him and allowed him to survive being stabbed in the heart. Plus, Lelouch won and executed a BRILLIANT scheme. With him "dead", the world is rid of its greatest enemy, Suzaku is punished for not siding with him (guilt from killing his friends), Schneizel has to follow Zero (not Lelouch, Zero), and he might even get to live on if he was able to contact C.C.    Death Note was kind of disappointing because Light just completely lost it in the end. He couldn't even kill Near with his secret note (which he could have done if he hadn't been so dramatic). Plus, I disliked both Mello and Near, so I was kinda pissed that they both didn't die. I think I'd have liked it better if L had come second and found Kira out.|`|1EML2Bolaa	Death Note was more interesting for me|`|SH2ysn6faa	death note had a funny ending see light was a horribl person so when kept getting shot and screaming and laughing it killed me i felt code geass was better it had a tight but messed up ending i liked it|`|fJR4nyKqaa	Death Note.    The ending songs really matched the whole anime. I felt more excited watching it because of the songs. :)|`|6FPpkmi6aa	Death Note:    It was short but had a great plot. They managed to keep the plot staright and hte suspense going, an dit had a great ending. ALthough I wish it was a little longer, it was still good. Well that's what I think, it was a great series in general, so yeah.......    Code Geas:    The ending I thought was sad and messed up. It wasn't very good b/c it was pretty much dumb. Why'd he fight all this time to die in the end, it's pretty dumb. Although the series was also good, and the the whole time it was amazing with all the action and fighting they had.    That's my opinion, so yeah... ^.^    *~AnimeLover101|`|tf2gDsJzaa	They both kinda sucked, but i liked Code Gease.Lelouch is an evil genious. >:)

They all rock.    my favorites are    Marina Mcbride-independace day  Taylor Swift- picture to burn(lol that song rocks)  Carrie Underwood - American Girl  Tim Mcgraw- Don't take the girl       Or tim mcgraw and faith hill - its your love  Brad Paisley- put a girl in it  Shaina Twain - Man I feel like a woman (classic)    my favorite song of all though is  cowgirls don't cry- by Brooks and Dunn!|`|cIvFOzoiaa	Martina McBride-Independence Day  Taylor Swift-Picture to Burn  Carrie Underwood-Some Hearts  Tim McGraw-Don't Take the Girl  Brad Paisley-Whiskey Lullaby  Shania Twain-No One Needs To Know  These are great songs, hope this helps.    Edit: Isn't Put a Girl in it Brooks & Dunn or some other duo?|`|rRCTvT7Saa	I'll include some of my favorites by the artists you mentioned that I listen to.      Martina McBride - all of her classic country covers on her album TIMELESS are outstanding and so is her song "Cheap Whiskey."  However, I think "Independence Day" might be her best song...or one of them, at least.    My all-time favorite artist, Brad Paisley - INSTRUMENTALS (strictly country):  "Throttleneck," "Huckleberry Jam," "The Nervous Breakdown," "Munster Rag" and "Cluster Pluck" with Brent Mason, Albert Lee, Vince Gill, Redd Volkaert, James Burton, John Jorgenson and Steve Wariner.  INSTRUMENTALS (more than just country):  "Make a Mistake with Me," "Turf's Up," "Time Warp," "Les is More," "Cliffs of Rock City," "Playing with Fire," "Kentucky Jelly," and quite a few more.  VOCAL DUETS:  "Come On In" with Buck Owens, "Start a Band" with Keith Urban, "More Than Just This Song" with Steve Wariner, "Whiskey Lullaby" with Alison Krauss, "Out in the Parkin' Lot" with Alan Jackson and "Let the Good Times Roll" with B.B. King.  VOCALS (serious songs):  "Time Well Wasted," "He Didn't Have to Be," "It Did," "Little Moments," "Part Two," "You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive," "Two People Fell in Love," "The World," "Holdin' on to You," "Cloud of Dust," "We Danced," etc.  VOCALS (humorous songs):  "Online," "Me Neither," "I'll Take You Back," "Alcohol," "I'm Gonna Miss Her," "The Cigar Song," "Celebrity," "Famous People," "Ticks," "Bigger Fish to Fry," "Mr. Policeman," etc.  GOSPEL:  "When We All Get to Heaven," "Farther Along," "The Old Rugged Cross," "In the Garden," etc.    Carrie Underwood - "Wasted" and "Don't Forget to Remember Me."    As for Taylor Swift, Tim McGraw and Shania Twain--I don't listen to them at all...I can't stand any of those three.        By the way, I think it would have been much easier if I had just said, "Anything of Brad Paisley's is great," instead of naming all those songs!

8nm2psyKaa	I just looked at the website amd saw that they accept paypal. fraudelent site most likely wouldnt accept paypal due to paypal's terms of service about not shipping things. They always side with the buyer so I would say yes it is a legit site|`|ceb43fe6318038970b3d8ad002b5fb8eaa	i was jus lukin on sum info about this site as well!!!       This was the best answer  "According to the main site, the Kanacca Company is based in China and they sell everything from electronics to lingerie. They work with factories in several different Chinese cities to bring together all types of merchandise. It appears that what they sell is copies of brand names. The merchandise is shipped from China, and there will be additional shipping charges and possible border fees, import taxes, and international duties added onto that too good to be true price. The name of one site owned by this conglomerate: "kanacca's secret" is a clue. It's a poor rip-off of the more famous "Victoria's Secret" brand and the two are not connected in any way. But they use the word secret in the name to trick you into thinking they are connected.    I am always skeptical of Chinese websites selling brand names as too good to be true prices. As often as not these items are counterfeit, not true brand name, cheap quality and poorly made. They aren't always up-front about the cost of importing, and in some instances people have had shipments stopped at the borders and they never receive their merchandise. Because these sites are international, consumer fraud laws of the USA and Canada don't apply to them.    In my opinion, the saving offered by many of these questionable sites that constantly spam Yahoo answers are not worth it. Like the old clich: If it seems to good to be true; it probably is. I prefer to patronize North American retailers, they may be a bit more expensive, but you have legal protection against fraud that these Chinese sites can't offer."

s7UWLOS9aa	I completely agree! I do not think it is fair. People can say bad, racist, things about caucasian people, and they don't consider it racist. But if we say one thing like them, we are considered racist. That's pretty messed up. And we would be considered racist if we had any holiday/month associated with white people, but it's okay to have a month for Black History Month, and they don't consider that racist. And like the previous people said, if you don't vote fo Obama, you're automatically racist.|`|HdSaN24caa	if you read your history books, all that is going on is exactly the way it happened in Germany in the early 30s. only we don't a lot of jews, so they picked whites. it's all part of the big plan.|`|lm2ByrhHaa	Its funny, this kind of thing just happened to me!

It was originally sang by the band  Fleetwood Mac then it was covered by Smashing Pumpkins in the 90's if I'm not mistaken, which is probably the one you heard with the male vocals and just recently it was covered again this time by The Dixie Chicks.|`|nXvSpky6aa	Hmmm...I would of said "Landslide" by Fleetwood Mac until you said it was a guy singing.

Shown for only 1/116 of a second, it goes by to quick for the naked eye, but the brain sees it and makes you more freaked out.

TSQF1O7Vaa	It really depends on how good you are.  If you are going for something interesting, try Karma Police (the chords are challenging for beginners)  Hotel California is another good one, especially if you can sing and have the time to learn the solo.  If you are a real noob try some of these:  Man who sold the world (David Bowie, Nirvana did a cover on their unplugged record)  Most Credence Clearwater Revival songs  Hard Day's Night (Beatles)  Brain Damage (Pink Floyd off DSOTM)|`|R6IYY4miaa	You should look at chordie.com. It's an awesome website and you can find almost any song on there. But here are some of the first songs I learned to play:    Mad World from Donnie Darko  Several Beatles songs including Let it Be, Lady Madonna, Yesterday, Yellow Submarine, Eleanor Rigby, and I've just seen a face  Brain Damage by Pink Floyd if you strum instead of pick   Boulevard of Broken Dreams- Green Day (I think)  Carry on my wayward son- Kansas|`|w3feYgkCaa	Try,  Scar Tissue - Red Hot Chili Peppers  Vulnerable - Secondhand Serande  Storms - November Blessing  Lovely - Breathe Carolina  Let Go - Frou Frou  BlackBird - The Beetles
13hDE66Oaa	Individually maybe, but not as a society.|`|tmwOwc0Laa	I doubt it|`|fUDlbOP0aa	well, depending on how you consider survive. will people from the remnants of the US survive? yes. will the majority of the people survive? no.   the truth is roughly half ore more of the population simply do not know what to do if the power went out and the services shut down. more than 2/3 has little or no emergency supplies of any kind at home. about 75% lack food that need not be cooked by a machine to eat, about half do not know how to cook their food by other means (example: a fire). less than 35% of the people have more than 2 day's water and 3 day's food at home for all the household's members.     once power is lost and about 2 days without any power restored and no sign that power will be restored, there will be the loss of law and order, there may be riots, mass looting, raiding, attacks, extreme crime levels. Law and order will be forever lost in large cities like LA, as there is only enough food in the shelves for 2 days. roughly half of America will starve or outbreak in open warfare to fight over limited supplies. in about 1 month more than 10 million will perish. 2 months and 50 million dead. supplies decrease, crime increases, vigilantism and hording is at an all time high. at 3 months the last of the unprepared die. anyone without supplies and unable to obtain any would of died within the first 8 weeks. at this point, the death toll surpasses 180 million. Obviously the lack of communications will make each faction of the nation think its local or statewide only.   4 months in and people continue dying by the millions as people's supplies drop to nothing and they starve to death. Farming will make a rebound as well-off survivors break out rations to start farming. there will be continues attacks and looting as old supplies rapidly dwindle.   5 months, trade may be established between surviving groups. communications (telegraph and radio) may be established.   6 months America will have lost more than 2/3 of its population (about 200 million people) and reverted to a medieval level of life. civil wars may still rage in parts of the nation. even if power comes back on, too much infrastructure has been lost to riots and violence that it won't do anything at all. It may be 2-3 years before America recovers and reunites, if people choose to revive this nation that started as an experiment in the 1780s. Or it may forever remain divided.|`|wDJRyzE9aa	Yes, but it won't be pretty|`|sVFkMVujaa	the entire country?  no.|`|55G0BNCzaa	i dont think they would die of starvation or being hot or cold. but i do think they would go completly insane and kill each other. it would be total chaos. just because we wouldnt have power, we are to spoiled.|`|AA11194909	i can't survive without those for 6 months so a country would probably collapse.  riots, murders, and NO txting or MUSIC! [digitally at least.]|`|QBFjMRfuaa	I don't think we could|`|UoDtGtiLaa	the nation itself would be in a state of mass chaos, but i am sure the amish would be ok :D|`|Mcr4IS6Vaa	Western countries would not be able to deal with not having power for 6 months. Us humans have created technology to prevent things like this from happening.|`|FttPArZ7aa	I think people would go crazy and cross the border to live in mexico for 6 months just to get electricity. I sure would.|`|tZ3jcxvjaa	Yes we are very resourceful.|`|lm2ByrhHaa	The best way to answer that, is to ask yourself whether YOU could survive! Me? No. I'm an electric guitar freak, I would die for sure!|`|5XJ3Nu8aaa	Yeah. We did it 100 years ago, we can do it now. Build a fire instead of a heater. Talk to people in real life instead of on a cell phone. Put your refrigerated food in a metal box in a creek. So you cant talk to your friends in the next state over. Big ******* deal. There's this new thing. Its called suck it up and deal with it.    And everyone who said we couldn't do it... you people beat all. So some of you are scared of the dark and some of you can't go without cell phones and iPods. Learn to sing and play guitar. Get  a lantern. Get something else while you're at it...|`|dhdz5uNSaa	No way|`|hu8o4vomaa	We could survive. This country has some resourceful people.|`|kgTPnjhkaa	no chance.....|`|Gh2KOKmcaa	no, most of us could not, a few would figure it out....our way of life is so used to having electricity we don't know how to survive anyway else|`|4x87U8kMaa	There is no way!!!|`|MFzG3eRdaa	me myself can't even stand to not have no power for over a day but that's just me so it's possible|`|AKVQNGcOaa	I don't think we could last for a month, let alone 6. Shameful right?|`|aavNyOeyaa	Read S.M. Sterling's The Change seris, the first one is Dies the Fire.  You will see what happens.|`|m3pFnkb6aa	it would sure suck without yahoo answers lol.|`|ENCAZO7Paa	My guesstimate is that many people would go mad.    Also, no, we would most likely not be able to survive.  Think of all of the aspects of our lives that use some form of electricity.  We would have to go back to the primitive ways of our ancestors, and this would not be an easy task.|`|d7700e32c034b0231bc54ef45dd9e791aa	Well you can drive without power and yes some could survive generators, wood stoves, gardens and hunting.  We haven't always had all this stuff you know.|`|CZxew9Hgaa	i need those.i can't survive one day without it.|`|L0ft1eo7aa	yes we could|`|Ljo0nb2daa	HELL NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|CQUuCpTQaa	Hell no! A few days without power and people go crazy, 6 months.. think about it!|`|GGpkMLwUaa	Well, thinking about the size of our nation and how much we rely on supply and demand, our factories would not run without power and obviously we could not run as a nation.|`|f5nVk8Xnaa	Pshh. Its America. No way would we survive.       Well, I would probably.

Getting a concussion from falling on the ice a few months ago,:(  Everyone saw me.|`|F4NzbOziaa	hmm lets see, i  walked in on my uncle in the bathroom (almost threw up after, just horrible)     i was in the school's washroom once with my friends and i started talking bad abt this girl and she walks out of one the stalls in the next second, she heard everything!!!! omg    there was this play at my school and i was sitting next to this girl and we were kinda commenting on everything abt the play and i was like "did you see the male lead? he's sooo horrible the worst actor ever ever and he's sooo gay" and she says this "thats my brother" AWKWARD lol|`|zvHYxpVCaa	1) puking on a table when my friends and i went to a mexican restaurant (we got the hell out of there lmao)    2) accidentally texting the wrong guy with a message that was a definite inside joke and very "sexual" per say.    3) being late to a class i got switched into on the first day (i knew no one!)|`|MI3r3jWeaa	Theres this classroom at my school where the windows are easy to open from the outside. And when its hot my class agreed the first one there is to go through the window and open the door so we can use the aircon...    ..Well one day it happened to be me. I was halfway through the window with my as.s outside and my hands on the floor. I heard someone behind me, i just thought it was another student.    well yeah, it wasn't it was my teacher, HE IS A REAL TIGHTAS.S. and he just goes 'Hello Cassie." like real casual. I was just hanging there from the window, then my friends arrived and started pissing themselves laughin.    When we got into the class the teacher goes 'Cassie, come up here and explain to everyone what you did."     It was so funny and awful.|`|9qKwTGeOaa	1. I was at a pool with two friends, and some guys next to us were playing catch with one of those soak ball (the ones that are like sponges that store water till they hit something). One of them accidentally threw it too far and it landed right by my feet, So I picked it up and thew it back at the guy...and the ball hit him right "there". LOL Then he fell into the pool XD    2. At a dance, I was hanging out with a bunch of my friends, and one of them, Justin, got real close to me and put his nose right against mine, Then i gave him a peck on the lips (just being funny) and he pulled away all grossed out. He's gay, that's why lol. I felt like such an idiot X_X    3. My BF and I were sitting with each other (we were faced away from everyone else). Then two of our friends, Patience and Amber, came up to us. Now see, Patience likes to tease me and my BF, so she came up to us and said "Ooh, were you guys just makin out?". We were like "No". Then she said, "Go ahead, go into the girls bathroom and make out". So then my BF gets up, says "Okay", walks over to the entrance of the girls' bathroom, and gives me a back on like "come here". It was both hilarious AND awkward cuz I wasn't sure if he meant it or not. XD    Those are my awkward moments ^_^|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	1. Falling into the creepy new teacher's classroom he tried to help me but i was like " uhh, no thanks!"    2.

8fOLKcjdaa	From a professional musician/vocalist:    Your voice has no feeling at all.  Vibrato (adding "waves" to your voice) would be a good thing to add.    However, you certainly have the voice to be a singer.  If you get a teacher and practice often, you might have the chance of making a career out of it.  You seem to have more potential than me.    However (yet again), the entertainment industry is very competitive.  I lucked out because I had plenty of connections.    Good luck.|`|DPKYQRYlaa	you sing really good i luv ur voice!|`|4BXm2EtKaa	I think that you are good but you need to try to make your singing flow.

For instance the notes of that song need to be held a little longer to show a little bit of your vocal talent. You're off to a good start but I suggest some vocal training from a private coach or you're local chorus teacher. I'm a serious singer and since getting a private coach my sound has improved drastically!! Good luck darling! You sound good already, but condition that voice with some training and you'll be even better! |`|Ud8n4Lknaa	u sound prrty good & u kinda sound like miley cyrus, ur just like me not wit the girly voice though lol but like u sed it depends on who i would like to sing in front of and u no try to open up more and maybe u can try another song that includes more vocals|`|5dx544amaa	not too bad...hard song to pull off|`|GFV4Wxkpaa	you have a beautiful voice :)|`|Zt3VS7wcaa	You have a great voice, try breathing exercises, they help a lot with all singers and they would really improve your voice!|`|oIwrHTtHaa	I think your really good!|`|DhQ58q44aa	That was actually pretty good!

pRuF8qOdaa	you have a really good voice!  use your vibrato to make it sound better:) but it already sounds really good!|`|07b8313b7096ade2a84057ef85256e06aa	I think it's pretty good, just improve on phrasing. =D That would be a great start. But with phrasing also comes proper breath support. But cheers to you!|`|oChIpQS3aa	you have a really pretty voice,keep it up hun!|`|rfWxuJ6iaa	That was amazing! (not lying).

ABTvd68Caa	10. John Doe- Se7en  Although only in the film for the last ten minutes his evil genius in staging such an elaborate and violent crime makes him a truly memorable bad guy    9. Roy Batty- Blade Runner  Perhaps the only bad guy that has one of the most memorable final lines of dialogue in cinema history.    8. T 1000- Terminator 2  The T-1000 added a level of intensity missing from Arnolds Terminator. This guy just doesnt give up.    7. Anton Chigurh- No Country for Old Men  More then his chilling cold heartedness is the unfortunate haircut that makes him a memorably fierce bad guy. Would you tell him he could do with a trim?    6. Jack Torrance- The Shining  Nicholsons over the top performance is what makes his transition into madness a terrifyingly entertaining one.     5. Jason Voorhees- Friday the 13th Series  This leviathan of a bad guy was an unstoppable killing force with no apparent motive but a flair for impaling teenagers. Fans will debate this but he is at his evil best in Part 2.    4. Hans Gruber- Die Hard  Hans Gruber was one of the smartest bad guys in film history. His wit was only surpassed by his cold calculating malevolence.     3. Freddy Kruger- Nightmare on Elm Street  The films were basically there for Freddy to dispose a series of unsuspecting teenagers in their sleep. Freddys constant attempts at humor throughout his rage fueled carnage made him sinfully evil and one of the more memorable bad guys.    2. Hannibal Lecter- Silence of the Lambs  Basing his performance on HAL from 2001 Anthony Hopkins presented a character of such evil that the film seems to become less interesting when he is not there. Unfortunate attempts to revive the character aside, the coldness of Dr. Lecter has sent chills up many a viewers spine.    1. Darth Vader- Star Wars & Empire Strikes Back  The greatest bad guy of them all that made being evil look incredibly tempting. Cloaked in the darkest of blacks and voiced to perfection by James Earl Jones he is by far the more interesting character of the saga.|`|YUaMtlnxaa	I'm not well watched when it comes to horror, so my list is probably off. Though some of the characters are definitely debatable, I find each  to be particularly evil.    10. Doug - The Reaping: An occult leader who tries to manipulate a grieving woman into murdering a child who he says is the Antichrist.  9. Long Hair - The Cowboys: Insane leader of a group of ex-convicts whose lousy past turned him into a cold-blooded and cowardly killer who pursues a group of kids.  8. Travis Bickle - Taxi Driver: Confused vigilante who's supposed Puritanism is contradicted by his own twisted addictions; eventually rejection and anger turn him into a murderer.  7. Harry Lime - The Third Man: In the ruins of Vienna after WWII, he steals medicine and combines it with excess to sell for a greater profit; ends up responsible for many innocent deaths.  6. Stansfield - Leon the Professional: Crooked DEA officer who kills a young girls family during a drug deal; his rage, mannerisms, and relentless pursuit an power make him terrifying.  5. Don Lope de Aguirre - Aguirre the Wrath of God: Power hungry conquistador who takes control of an expedition for the golden city; he becomes delusional and goes mad as the quest brings death.  4. Hans Beckert - M: A child molestor and murderer with two personalities; when captured he pleads insanity and reveals his dark and twisted mind.  3. The Emperor - Star Wars: The creator of Darth Vader, the devil like character started wars to satisfy his power lust.  2. The Joker - The Dark Knight: Dark and crazy anarchist who uses people as tools for his own evil purposes.  1. Lady Kaede - Ran: Secudtress who persuades two brothers to rebel against their father to gain control of a kingdom; has a horryfing blood lust.|`|JqhQSjQFaa	THE JOKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|jGbkpaKbaa	hitch  benjamin button  the whole dance crew in stomp the yard|`|FatPLXhuaa	darth vader  darth maul  Kearney, jimbo and dolph  nelson  hitler  the guy in charge of the organization in the bourne trilogy  mr. smith  borgs  kevin and buzz

m0kQMWYeaa	read all through i know there long but meh its worthit    A wife was in the kitchen making a breakfast of fried eggs for her husband. Suddenly , her  husband burst into the kitchen.  Careful, he said, CAREFUL! Put in some more butter! Oh my gosh! You're cooking too many  at once. TOO MANY! Turn them! TURN THEM NOW! We need more butter. Oh my gosh! WHERE are we  going to get MORE BUTTER? They're going to STICK! Careful. CAREFUL! I said be CAREFUL! You  NEVER listen to me when you're cooking! Never! Turn them! Hurry up! Are you CRAZY? Have you  LOST your mind? Don't forget to salt them. You know you always forget to salt them. Use the  salt! USE THE SALT! THE SALT!  The wife stared at him. What in the world is wrong with you? You think I don't know how to  fry a couple of eggs?  The husband calmly replied, I just wanted to show you what  it feels like when I'm driving."    all 3 of these made me laugh out LOUD ok    Harry and Paul are in a waiting room at a clinic to be tested for mental health Harry gets called in first and the doctor asks him what would happen if i poked your eye out harry replies i would be blind in one eye ok says the doctor and what will happen if i poke them both out harry replies i will be completely blind.Harry then leaves as he walks past paul he whispers the answers into Paul's ear paul goes in and the doctor says what will happen if i chop of one of your ears paul says i would be blind in one eye hmmm okay says the doctor what will happen if i chop off both of your ears paul says i will be blind in both eyes the doctor says how will this make you blind paul thinks for a second and says uh because your hat will fall off your head    lol    and    The headmistress of an all girls school asks the local vicar to give a talk on christianity and sex. The vicar is happy to do so but doesn't want to upset his prudish wife so tells his wife he is doing it on sailing. A week later the head see's the vicars wife in the street and tells her what an excellent talk he gave the girls his wife says oh i cant imagon it was that good he has only done it twice the first time he was sick the second time his hat blew off|`|2a9jRZGRaa	THE SUNBURN  A young man finally got a date with the blonde female that sat across from him in college class. To prepare for his big date, the young man went up on to the roof of his parents condo in order to tan himself. Not wanting any tan lines to show, he sunbathed in the nude.     Unfortunately, the young man fell asleep while on the roof and managed to get sunburn on his "tool of the trade". But, he was determined not to miss his date, so he put some lotion on his manhood and wrapped it in gauze.     The blonde showed up for the date at his condo, and the young man treated her to a home cooked dinner, after which they went into the living room to watch a movie. During the movie, however, the young man's sunburn started acting up again. He asked to be excused, went into the kitchen and poured a tall, cool glass of milk.     He then placed his sunburned member in the milk and experienced immediate relief of his pain. The blonde, however, wondering what he was doing, wandered into the kitchen to see him with his member immersed in a glass of milk.     Upon seeing this, the blonde exclaimed, "So that's how you guys load those things!"|`|N0fKhg7vaa	humpty dumpty sat on a rock  little bo peep was s//cking his c*ck.    as soon as he came she started to weep  she knew by the taste he'd be f**king her sheep!|`|1305765249b53f290c467decdedb9e3aaa	there was a boy with a bucket   who had D@ck so big he could suck it  he said with a grin  while wiping his chin   if my ear was a c@nt I would f@ck it    what is white and flies through the air   The second coming of the lord     why did the farmer win the noble prize   because he was out-standing in his field|`|GfHnW6staa	An Amish woman and her daughter were riding in an old buggy one cold blustery day. The daughter said to her mother, "My hands are freezing cold."   The mother replied, "Put them between your legs. Your body heat will warm them up." The daughter did, and her hands warmed up.   The next day the daughter was riding with her boy friend who said, "My hands are freezing cold."   The girl replied, "Put them between my legs. The warmth of my body will   warm them up." He did, and warmed his hands.   The following day the boyfriend was again in the buggy with the daughter. He said, "My nose is cold."   The girl replied "Put it between my legs. The warmth of my body will warm it up." He did, and warmed his nose.   The next day the boyfriend was again driving with the daughter, and he said, "My penis is frozen solid."   The following day the daughter was driving in the buggy with her mother   again, and she says to her mother, "Have you ever heard of a penis?"   Slightly concerned the mother said, "Why, yes. Why do you ask?"   The daughter replies, "They make one hell of a mess when they defrost,   don't they!"|`|r3QbyYSSaa	There was a boy who worked in the produce section of a super market. A man came in and asked to buy half a head of lettuce. The boy told him that they only sold whole heads of lettuce, but the man replied that he did not need a whole head, only half.     The boy explained that he would have to ask the manager and so he walked into the back room and said, "There is some jerk out there who wants to buy only a half a head of lettuce." As he finished saying this, he turned around to find the man standing right behind him, so he quickly added, "And this gentleman wants to buy the other half." The manager okay-ed the request and the man went on his way.     Later on the manager said to the boy, "You almost got yourself in a lot of trouble earlier, but I must say I was impressed with the way you got out of it. You think on your feet and we like that around here.     Where are you from, son?" The boy replied, "Minnesota, sir." "Oh, really? Why did you leave Minnesota?" inquired the manager. The boy replied, "They're all just whores and hockey players up there." "My wife is from Minnesota", exclaimed the manager. The boy instantly replied, "Really! What team did she play for?"          A man in his 40's bought a new BMW and was out on the interstate for a nice evening drive. The top was down, the breeze was blowing through what was left of his hair, and he decided to open her up. As the needle jumped up to 80 mph, he suddenly saw flashing red and blue lights behind him. "There's no way they can catch a BMW," he thought to himself and opened her up further. The needle hit 90, 100.... then the reality of the situation hit him. "What the heck am I doing?" he thought and pulled over.    The cop came up to him, took his license without a word, and examined it and the car. "It's been a long day, this is the end of my shift, and it's Friday the 13th. I don't feel like more paperwork, so if you can give me an excuse for your driving that I haven't heard before, you can go." The guy thinks for a second and says, "Last week my wife ran off with a cop. I was afraid you were trying to give her back." "Have a nice weekend," said the officer.|`|6Hq8Xxivaa	putting make up on you is like putting diamonds on doodoo

If they were afraid, i would feel offended.  unless i did something wrong.    two years is not a big difference in anything. if you just want to be friends with them it shouldnt matter.|`|yQHiAw9oaa	no offense but whats the point to this question|`|NbXEJwZkaa	1.yes  2.yes  3.yes  4.12th  5.Id say "ok ill take you home then, why are you hanging out with me if your uncomfortable in the first place"  6.yes  7.female  8.17  9.depends on how you act, although this is how i view all people  10.no, ill get my chance one day  11.thats their problem, im not the one its hurting, they can act all timid and afraid while i walk around like i own the place    And P.S. why are you asking all this if you hate 1991ers.  You're obviously immature and young by making such a statement. This is probably about a girl two years older than you, right?|`|gxczXgvXaa	Not my year, buddy.|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	1.

SvRhoavUaa	Is the second wii remote connected? Make sure the remote is synced with your wii console and make sure you have two guitar controllers. It should let you choose the bass option. If you're still having problems make sure your wii remote doesn't need batteries, and check your manual to troubleshoot the problems you might have.
IqCkjljkaa	sick. hello Jon Benet Ramsey|`|JbRTKDFmaa	I think it's a bit twisted. I think children should be allowed to be children. They should be finger painting and swinging on the swings, not wearing makeup and being put on display.|`|I1K6SC43aa	I think it's sickening.    Have you seen Little Miss Sunshine? Those girls looked like clowns.|`|lIQhB56Oaa	It's stupid.|`|AA11523465	It's pretty much my opinion too.  We are in too much of a hurry to have our babies grow up.  It's the baby beauty pageants, the "girls gone wild" crap, and all the stuff like that, that are ruining our little girls.  Then they grow up to be bitches.  Sorry, but they do.|`|13G12GCRaa	Well, I don't think they should put all that make-up on them. I mean, they are 3 year olds for pete's sake!!! But, I think it's cute as long as they don't look too old for their age...|`|ivUPlEwDaa	Well, I will proabaly recieve a thumbs down rain storm for this, but...   I think that pageants are wonderful. My mother put me into pageants when I was 3 months old. I am 14 and still in them. They are fun and a really great experience. I have a lot of self confidence, trust me. I also sing, dance, act, and do gymnastics. I have a 4.0 GPA, skipped a grade, started kindergarten a year early, have a lot of friends, and have a lot of self confidence. Trust me, it hasn't ever broken me and my mom pushes me to win and I do! You don't even know how great it is, yo uare jus tjudging. Who cares about Jon Benet, every other girl is NOT her.    I WAS able to be a kid. I have art projects and pictures of me painting, playing in the dirt, playing in the sand, running around, just being a kid. Sure, yo uahve to practice and get ready for pageants, but they are not all day every day, and I do a lot of pageants. Seriously, how would you even know?|`|oyq0vrWNaa	Robert Pattinson is gay.

But I dont know why I'm answering this since I dont like the band. But again there are better vidoes out there with better bands and better songs. Whats the point of music videos anyway?|`|1MLIYilNaa	I can't see it lol.  I think my computer hates My Chemical Romance. Seriously.  It won't load their official site properly, and now that MCR releases a new video, my computer decides to be a ***** and crash whenever I try to watch it.    lol I'm just gonna wait until Feb. the 9th (or whenever they release it properly) so that I can watch it on tv. Mahaha, like Teenagers, NZ was the first country in the world to see it on tv. Hopefully it's like that for Desolation Row, because I really want to see it!|`|sESa8iycaa	yes i LOVE it MCR is the best band ever!!!!11!! =DD|`|rCx9t2dUaa	i loved it   i thought it showed the grown up yet childish side of them  it was classic them with a twist i think   alot of people are like this isn't the mcr i knew   but u have to consider that it isn't a song they wrote so they didn't write it for there voices and wat not.   but i love them so much and can't wait for the new cd hopefully coming out soon!|`|pQBjqMkoaa	no thanks      mcr is so 2006|`|5qwqu6GQaa	I haven't seen it yet! x[  Where can I see it?

I freaking love the song though.|`|JQp2Siskaa	I love the video and song. It's awesome.
7ulaznL1aa	I use myxer tones and from there you can make ring tones from music files on your computer! It's really awesome, once you decide the part of the song you want it sends a text message. I have Verizon but I'm pretty sure it works no matter what you have.  They also have songs already on there that you can dl but I don't think there's a large selection anymore.|`|IKbKx9gyaa	mobile17.com, it's free and it works. you can also put pictures on your phone. and they wont spam your email.

Something that is easy to insure, easy to handle and easy on fuel. Jetta is an estate car that you'd see a 50 year old man with kids of varying ages driving. Go for a Clio, or Corsa, or similar.

Two, talk to her and explain how texting can be important, like if you need her to pick you up from school and have no time to call her (that is, if you can't drive yourself), etc,etc.  Just explain to her the reasons and be mature about it. =)|`|W2qyu5zFaa	First of all, don't call your mom retarded. Be respectful. I can't believe kids are so angry because they can't text.  Maybe you could offer to pay for it because it is pretty expensive.|`|7DdH4dDZaa	Chill, there are kids in Africa who don't even know what a cell phone is, stop complaining...|`|Ju5azN0Kaa	It's overrated.  You don't really NEED to text. You're being far too dramatic. You'll live.|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	What?  You do absolutely nothing.   Act like you don't care and Whallah.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	How old are you?|`|WggRi7MZaa	Come on, you don't NEED to text, just 'cause everybody else is.  Calling is much more convenient.|`|MhowmBl9aa	I'm 16, almost 17, and I too have never had texting. Honestly, I'm actually kind of glad; I don't want to become one of those text freaks.     If it's a money issue, ask her if you can buy a prepaid cell phone instead. Like this you save money, and have texting. If it's for any other reason, I really don't know what to tell you...|`|kkyr4B53aa	Normally a cell PHONE should be used just as a regular home PHONE: to TALK when you communicate.  Texting runs up a bill if you don't have the unlimited plan, and getting unlimited texting is expensive.  I am sure you will live.|`|ZUL3drNgaa	get over it and use email?|`|m3L6pLBaaa	well she pays the bill so you just have to live with it.|`|3ucrmVSpaa	Try asking this question in family.

f5UmSdoMaa	Chester Bennington's solo album is Dead By Sunrise. It's not coming out in spring though, that info's outdated. He said a week ago in an interview that he thinks it might be out by September, realistically.     However, he is working on the new LP album at the same time. So in short, there's two CD's this year to be looking out for from the guys.|`|lAZWTLtRaa	Hah Dead by Sunrise is another band, and Chester is in it, just like Mike Shinoda has Fort Minor|`|DaH0rOghaa	O i hope not|`|GXYYv22qaa	well if it was on the site, i would assume it's true... lol.

FttPArZ7aa	what if your parents are 13 years apart... lets say 40 and 53. Not bad right?     ... Lets say a thirteen year old.. goes out with [i know its dumb] but a one year old.     big difference? Yep. You got it. Maturity level. Physical and mentally.    A thirteen year old is barely beginning to develop whilst a 17 year old is in the late stages of puberty. And also, the mindset is different.|`|w4LKvr0daa	what does a 17 year old have in common with a 13 year old?    it's not a matter of age, it's a matter of maturity. A 44 year old and a 50 year old have generally the same maturity level.        lmao, I totally wrote that before I even looked at the details of your question XD|`|v4MtQBReaa	are you the 13 year old?|`|EuSuxq3Iaa	you got it kiddo^_^|`|m3pFnkb6aa	I think you make good points but its illegal.|`|e5Q1IPylaa	I had a friend whose mum and dad started dating when she was 14 and he was 19.   It might have been a fluke though....|`|vxQEqHvzaa	It is legal... but mentally the two will be living in completely different worlds.|`|AKVQNGcOaa	It could happen. But if they are immature, it could be a bad idea . . .|`|unZQcu4Oaa	is this even a ?|`|aAldivPsaa	No, on so many levels.|`|dz2YYh7Saa	Yes - but the 44 & 50 year old are adults & not children.  A 13 year old is still a child & a 17 year old is about the same.    There's a big difference in the age thing when we are talking about children & adults.|`|cXj0RqExaa	I agree exactly with what you said.|`|HC9uF5Ibaa	I think that it's alittle bit on the edge. The following year, he/she will be 18, and then there will be legality issues.|`|ENCAZO7Paa	It just seems odd when you're younger.  For example, the 13-year-old might not be developed yet.|`|3SsKTZcCaa	I don't think there is any problem.   It's not that normal... but still    If the 13 year old is mature enough.   But a 17 year old guy might ask a lot on the sex part, that the 13 year old might not want.   And if they both like each other loads.|`|aQvjsFanaa	17 and 13- NO!  17 and 21- maybe...  21 and 25- sure  25 and 29- yes.|`|hxrJo6Z4aa	Well if your 18 and you have sex with a minor it's considered a degree of rape. (Of course I don't think 13 year olds should be having sex) but I think just dating is ok, as long as the 13 year old is mature (mentally and physically, because some 13 year olds look 10 and act it) The 17 year old should be even more mature and not encourage sex, wait until the 13 year old is older (at least when their both adults, like 24 and 20, i would say at least 16 but the 17 year old would be an adult already and once again it would be a degree of rape even if the minor consented)|`|Ljo0nb2daa	I think you can date any body any age just not like if your 17dating a 60 year old that ******* nasty.|`|tmwOwc0Laa	NEVER|`|mggll8dRaa	The Teens are still Formative Years, there is a huge difference in reasoning & Maturity;    Older Ages, the mind is actually declining,and age is much less of a factor....!!|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	no, it's legal.  go for it.   ;)|`|69YQw3Kwaa	what you said and because you can easily see the age difference between a 17 and 13 year old while at 44 and 50 you can't really tell|`|Sv9SQqyoaa	ya i think that would be the reason  also maybe if the guy was the older one  his intentions would be questioned  it pretty much is the same for the girl being older though|`|d945dd18c2ccb3f0bf1f4c170ff4619faa	It's perfectly legal to have this relationship. The 13 year old can be mature in personality, just as the 17 year old. Sexual experiences are also considered legal at these ages, of course with mutual consent.  Once the 17 year old turns 18, the relationship can still exist, however, by law(s), sexual experiences together are strictly prohibited. If caught, the 18 year old will be convicted of statutory-rape, regardless of consent from the underage 13/14 year old.|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	I think its kind of obvious why a 17 year old cant date a 13 year old.|`|5jqfKDdfaa	Eww....In a year that would be called pedoplilia|`|YSdwkhHRaa	You're right on.  A 17-year-old is in the position to take advantage of a 13-year-old's naivete. You do a lot of growing up during those years.|`|BswVoF8Paa	I dont think its a good idea, they can take advantage of you.|`|AA11194909	if u know the answer to ur own question why post it!?  i agree.|`|RzvSo2yUaa	wow four years does make a difference on the maturity level of a teen. I agree with your reasoning as to why it isn't ok. I wonder if 18 with a 22 yearold guy sounds bad|`|kPMxo2MCaa	I'm 17 years old and a senior in Highschool, so it would be like me dating a seventh grader. That's a definite no.|`|RfPDOPEwaa	because a 17 year old who is going after a 13 year old is obviously looking for an easy target.    once your both over 18, age is less important because its legal lol.     me personally i wouldn't date anyone to much older than me.|`|HQKfZEKxaa	that's almost like pedophilia|`|lIQhB56Oaa	I agree.|`|3BX15PwBaa	Edgar Allen Poe did the same.|`|HWkXDSqkaa	I think in one more year that would be considered illegal.|`|AA12383908	A 13 year old is still a child when you are 44 you are an adult.|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	i stoped reading  by the 3rd like.|`|5cfnDmI7aa	when I was 13 I dated a 17 year old and am I ever SORRYYY for that. no, its NOT the same thing becasue an age difference in adults is much different from an age difference in teens, a 13 yr old and a 17 year old ARE NOT looking for the same thing, that I promise you|`|rNvXWMOMaa	thats because 13yr olds have raging hormones..  it's best not to let them date unless you want to be a grandparent  within the next 9 months.|`|cYFAo75Yaa	did you fall and bump your head? 44 isn't 13. 13 is a child 44 is an adult it's not the same thing.|`|Ye2jYohaaa	Well, the difference between seventeen and thirteen is four right? And the difference between, say, 36 and 32 is four too right? Well, what's the difference? The difference is that 4 is around 1/3 of the 13 year olds life and around 1/4 of the seventeen year olds life, whereas, four is 1/8 of the thirty-two year olds life and 1/9 of the thirty-six year olds life.|`|gUdFFYNTaa	Well, 4 years apart.... so, I think the 13 year old might be a little less mature than the 17 year old. I don't know the actual situation, but consider this: What happens when they are 18 and 14?  13 year olds shouldn't be dating 17 year olds. 13 year olds are only in like 6th or 7th grade. They shouldn't be dating at all.        Marie Sensei: Yeah.... that 13 year old was also Poe's cousin.   That wasn't really frowned apon in the 1800's.|`|ZUL3drNgaa	I think you're exactly right. People that young are still changing, but people in their middle age or something have caught up with each other. Plus with older guys, they tend to take advantage of the younger girl a lot. I suppose maturity levels and the mindframe. At 17, most guys are thinking, "man, shes hot!" at 30, most guys are thinking, "she looks nice today and she has a really great personality!"   girls are thinking "omg, hes cute!!!!" at 13. At 30, its more like "wow, he's funny, smart, and intelligent! and good - looking!"   so ya. like that, i guess. I can't think of a 17 year old id wanna date though . . . uck.|`|4drQ38qZaa	Yes a 23 year old and 30 year old can be in love and married in all because they are legal adults. No 17 and 13 year olds can't date or have any sexual contact until they both reach 18 year old.|`|14f5d1b00e3913722f81d4b3a53a087eaa	Exactly.......go to school and have fun now don't get tied down cause it's not all its cracked up to be....you are just to young to know that. And that my friend is why a 13yr old should not be in a serious relationship with a 17yr old. They can't handle the emotions and difficulties of a steady long term relationship.

hJP9y6kjaa	The first stanza doesn't seem to connect to the rest of the lyrics.    "it's all gone to hell / in the downward spiral" ... sounds like you took the name from the nine inch nails album and slapped it into your lyrics. There's a few instances of words or phrases that don't really fit or aren't explained very well... "one fell swoop" for instance. It's cliche, it doesn't really fit.    How does procrastination lead to her being alone? Why is it such a tragedy? I guess I don't get it. She can't go alone?      Saul

GybjVZxtaa	I think music requires talent. Not a stupid beat from a computer and people talking monotone in the background in derogatory ways about different types of people or anything (rap). It should have things like guitars and actual singing... anything from Bon Jovi to Panic at the Disco to Linkin Park to Queen... just... some things are unacceptable and the music industry is failing and just using anything it can to make money. And the pathetic teens of America are falling for it (with the exception of few who grew up with REAL music >_> )|`|sSEy6KYiaa	What is going on with the music industry? it is going under while digital file sharing takes over.    that first link is seriously sad.

During their quest for vengeance, Michaels world is turned upside down when he learns that Sara is still alive. Realizing the only way they will truly be free, Michael and Lincoln avenge to find Sara and take down The Company. With the help of a government handler, they assemble a group of allies and familiar faces including Mahone, Sucre and Bellick to aid in their seemingly impossible task. Unfortunately for the brothers, they must also enlist T-Bag, who unknowingly possesses a vital clue to help them pull off their most difficult challenge yet. Theyll soon discover the only thing harder than breaking out is breaking in.
046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	This is like asking who can eat just one potato chip, impossible for me.  I'm a huge fan.  I can pick an album:  The White Album.  I can also pick a compilation:  Beatles 1.  Great selection on that one.  However, I cannot choose a single favorite song.  Stop twisting my arm!  OK, OK, "Come together" would have to be the one, but only because you are twisting my arm.  LOL!|`|lGmNaow0aa	This is a toughy, but if i had to pick just one, it'd probably be a day in the life.

Sih0xHJgaa	I hate sitting next to someone who smells bad (I mean I'm not trying to be rude or anything but there are some people who just smell bad)...and also if the actual bus/subway smells...that's annoying; I've been in some that smell like pee, and even animals like cats or something...ugh    And also, people who are fully capable of standing up who don't stand up to let someone elderly or pregnant, etc. to sit down. Or the people who feel they have to hop over everyone and make so much effort to get a seat only to sit there for like a few stops and get up...like I mean seriously are they that lazy that they can't stand up for those few stops instead of practically climbing over others??!! And, another thing are those people that sit at the ends of seats when it's really busy causing others to have to climb over them into the seat behind just because they don't want someone to sit beside them or they're too lazy to move over to the inside seat...honestly. Oh, and another, when people put their bags and **** on the seats when it's really busy so that others can't sit down, so selfish.    lol, k I think I'm done now

If you listen to songs on the radio, you'll notice that these days, song's don't always rhyme, and they sound better that way. If you change up some of the lyrics and change the rhyme scheme, the song could have some potential.    You have to be careful about putting non-copyrighted material on here. Someone may steal it.|`|1vCoaf08aa	1. I hate Rhianna and Taylor Swift  2. Mommy just said that so you'd stop bugging her with your crappy music  3.

Try to use more metaphors, that makes the song deeper and more unique.   Hope this helped!|`|wDrhWyUvaa	it reminds me of a young Lil Wayne, before the coming out of the closet, and such.|`|Mx11gL67aa	That's what moms are for.   It's not that great, sorry.|`|zZPbmxWkaa	Your mom was wrong.|`|TSQF1O7Vaa	Do you just have lyrics?  It would be better if you put some chords and timing up.  Judging from the lyrics I would say it is just another clone of those famous people's music.  People get famous for a uniqueness to their sound.    That is why bands like Black Sabbath and Van Halen and The Nine Inch Nails ( i realize it is only Trent Renzor) got so famous.  They didn't sound like anything else people had heard.     As for your song, the lyrics are really meaningless and... stupid.|`|GDWHKzd5aa	Its been so long, long, long, since i have seen your face. i try to be strong, strong, strong but the strength i have is washing away     ect...    i wana make up right now now now   i wana make love right now now now  wish we never broke up right now now now   i want you to fly with me! i love that song it the bestist eva!!!!!!|`|MJwA647Waa	that sounds like a awful song. tell your mom to stop lieing to you.

35b1cf01233843e36ebe132a4a67ea01aa	Speed (1994)  An extortionist has placed a bomb on a city bus which will explode if it drops below 50 miles per hour (80 km/h). Great action, great tension and whether you like him or not, this is the film that make Keanu Reeves a movie star for a reason.    Although somebody actually made this trailer at home, the theatrical trailer just gives away too much of the film. This is just enough to whet your appetite!  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Jmgy8ZPA...    Speed was a critical and a commercial success. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 93% of critics gave the film positive reviews.     Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, "Films like Speed belong to the genre I call Bruised Forearm Movies, because you're always grabbing the arm of the person sitting next to you. Done wrong, they seem like tired replays of old chase cliches. Done well, they're fun. Done as well as Speed, they generate a kind of manic exhilaration".     In his review for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers wrote, "Action flicks are usually written off as a debased genre, unless, of course, they work. And Speed works like a charm. It's a reminder of how much movie escapism can still stir us when it's dished out with this kind of dazzle".|`|8ivnzNi5aa	"Live And Let Die."  It was the first of the James Bond movies to feature Roger Moore.  I especially love the boat chase scene, and some of the shots of a young Jane Seymour.     I also like "The Dogs Of War."  Starring Christopher Walken and Tom Berenger, this is about a group of mercenary soldiers who plot to overthrow a small country in Africa.  In a similar vein, try "The Wild Geese."  This stars Richard Burton  Richard Harris, and Roger Moore as leaders of another group of mercenaries, this time hired to rescue an African politician from a prison camp.|`|c3Kay8Z3aa	X-Men is my favorite. It shows a lot of characters and a lot of different powers. The action scenes are the best and I've seen the movie at least 10 times...

kIIwc4dLaa	Dakora Fanning is way to good for twilight she has won an award of the accademy of science fiction , fantasy and fiction and horror films as the best young acrtress in the us .  she has won many awards and has been at the oscars at age 9 she is way too good for twilight. twilight would be a step down for the oh so lovely Dakota Fanning|`|c3Kay8Z3aa	Yep, definitely...she can handle ANY role thrown at her!     http://home.comcast.net/~pjhinfo/site/?/...|`|nprzHREiaa	i don't know, should Vanessa Hudghens play Leah?|`|AA11915664	well i loved robert as edward....but the question is dakota- yeah, she can do it. she's a really talented actress. it takes a real talent to turn themselves into the character. i feel she can bring it to life on the big screen.|`|hQQSmvH8aa	i really dont think so that is SO not how i imagined jane. i think it should be someone with like dark eyes and darkish redish hair. and for vanessa hudgens i actually think she might be good as leah but at the same time she is kind of wierd. but i dont think dakota fanning should play jane.|`|JQSRuAJUaa	I agree with you about Vanessa Hudgens, she is not a very good actor!I don't know about Dakota Fanning, she kinda looks too old for the part!|`|FtOylJg9aa	i think she will do ok but being a huge fan of the saga i have my own perspective of who should play jane but i think she will do ok i don't like robert though i think they should have picked a better actor|`|nZJJAiFXaa	I think she will play the part well. She has most of the adjectives that describe Jane except for the blonde hair and i think she is going to either die it or wear a wig. Also she has done some great acting in other movies. I think shes going to do well at the part. hope i helped.|`|lBtcFqpJaa	Dakota Fanning should die.|`|S076VFH0aa	Dakota Fanning would be perfect for Jane. If she were younger, that is.  She's far too old; yes, she is a fantastic actress, but Jane and Alec are meant to be children, nine or ten years old at the most.  Dakota is about fourteen, and she'd not be able to pull it off.  I've heard they're considering that guy out of HSM who's Sharpay's brother for the role of Alec. He's too old, too.

Where will that lead you? You will no doubt say that the stomach, liver and intestines are of no great interest to you, because it is beauty that you look for in a human being and you will find this beauty in their face, their eyes, their hands, etc. Yes, but do not confine yourself to these either. Try to go further, otherwise you are laying yourself open to disappointment, because you are limiting yourself to purely material details. If you want to feel always inspired, try to take delight in the presence and subtle emanations of all beings around you, with the thought that an invisible divinity is hidden in every one. Over and beyond the physical body of a man or woman, there is everything that emanates from their soul, from their spirit, and that is what is most important.|`|5R7N5dcYaa	Wtf?|`|T6WYXtdfaa	Wait until you and the liver exchange vows, son.|`|lEjYhwxkaa	that is sick.|`|Gh2KOKmcaa	uhm i just don't know what to say to this|`|pWCEwnvZaa	wait until you get married  doing that in a jar is like, weird, very weird|`|F4BIqnWoaa	Dude.

Worst: Order of the Phoenix because I just didn't understand it until further analysis and people explaining.

His "halo" is what's making her so happy and she prays that he wont go away. and when she says "i swore I'd never fall again. but this don't even feel like falling." means she probably had a bad relationship in the past and swore she'd never fall in love again, but he makes her feel so special that she can't help but fall in love with him and it doesnt feel like it cause he is the best thing that has happened to her.

Here's a video of the band that she used to be in:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDqH6hJPB...    Again I'm not positive if she is the one doing the backup vocals but this appears to be right.      Hope this helps :)

You would have second finger on E on the A string and 1st finger on the D  behind that.     4th position is with your 1st finger on E on the A string.

lWGFf6GCaa	learn the dorian mode (b3 b7) and mixolydian mode (b7)    dorian can be used over m7 chords such as Dm7  mixolydian can be used over dominant 7th chords such as G7|`|TSQF1O7Vaa	Look at minor pentatonic scales, there is a whole science about using them and they can sound pretty good.    I really find Diminished scales interesting.  Beware, the theory behind them is complicated and they only work well in certain situations.  However they are very versatile and can act as a good transition point between different keys and chord progressions.    If you are looking at modern jazz look at some of the more classical scales like Harmonic and Melodic minors and their modes.    And of course look at staples like the bebop scale.

Ok now I don't know if you are familiar with the "Caylee Sunshine Doll" but if your not go to this link and sign the petition, You can read whats going on right on the petition...this guy trying to sell these dolls is completely, just really trying so hard to make some money!! Stating that he is going to give it all to charity which is a lie...when first asked about the profits, he stated, "i don't know how much of the profits will be going to charity, because I haven't sold one yet.." haha yeah ok, and now ALL OF A SUDDEN, he is donating 100% of the profits to an unknown charity, (if that is true, you should be ashamed of yourself CHARITY because you are profiting off of a little girl's death/likeness) its sick! Anyways, go and check out the petition...and also I'm giving you a link to a couple spots where this guy has been trying to sell the dolls, PLEASE DON'T LET THIS JERK DO THIS, TO THIS POOR LITTLE GIRL, WHO HE IS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF! thank you in advance!    http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/sayn...|`|UeMz0uEBaa	No i dont think he has anything to with caylee's death.    Casey's PIMP  Baez is just looking for someone else to put the blame on not on his INNOCENT(bullshit) client.  He will blame anyone just to get the client the not guilty plea.    All i can really say is no matter how much her parents or her PIMP team tries to make her look like she actually cared about that little girl, no one foolish enough will fall for bad acting.

XfvQCokaaa	dude, you're into weed sandwich too! Dude, awesome! I've seriously never found anyone else like me!    Okay, well, I know all these answers, so... awesome! (and yeah, you're probably joking about all this but I seriously know this stuff and have done all three.    a) sometimes, I add a little baby powder to my weed to make it last longer. Like, just mix a little in the powder and you'll make your weed last longer.  Just make a ciggarette-length line of the pot, and ... well, basically just try to copy a ciggarette. Buy a pack and open a ciggarette to admire their style.    b) Get some wine. Your choice of which wine. Or some other alchoholic beverage, but wine seems to work best. Take out a frying pan and use the wine instead of no-stick spray. Sprinkle some weed all throughout the pan. It'll start frying and sizzling, and once the bottom starts blackening, conjure forth a piece of bread and scrape it out of the pan onto the bread. Then build your sandwich.  Simple as pie. Since when I did it I already had the pan fryin stuff, I made a grilled cheese sandwich and used the weed on it.    c) making tea is harder to do. It's alot of trouble, so I wouldn't recommend it, but whatev. I got a tea bag, and emptied some of it out, and replace the stuff that got out with pot. I held it closed with my fingers and shook it real good. Then I got a coffee pot filter (cause I use coffee pots to make my tea, which is the easiest way for me to do it), and poured the tea bag's newly-modified content into the coffee filter, then went about as if I was making coffee, but the coffee was tea and weed. Tasted like crap though. I ended up pouring it down the drain. Seriously. But if you mix some alchohol in with the tea it will musk the grotesque bitterness.|`|s7UWLOS9aa	You're a loser.

WkUHHE0Jaa	just get a squier. They give you everything an amp, strap, guitar and it looks similar to the Fender Stratocaster. (Hendrix if you don't know the strat).

It is important that you don't buy a cheap guitar just because its new. They lack the quality that is necessary if you want to teach yourself and not get discouraged. I personally own a durable used Fender but my first choice would have been a secondhand Gibson SG or Les Paul but they were just out of my price range. Also be sure to get you guitar tuned for you, maybe new strings if you can afford it. I found that as a beginner, having a low string gauge made it easier to pick up quickly. One last thing, a good guitar should have good action-the strings are close to the fret board high on the neck but do not touch the frets down low. Mostly everything made by Fender or Gibson has good quality, I've also heard good things about Peavey.|`|0RmyNcMoaa	acoustic is best to start on.|`|AA11593592	budget yourself 200 bucks for a decent beginner guitar|`|tAygJFiTaa	definetly a fender or a sg dream caster check them out at www.yobt.com   lol hope it helped|`|ijzAvfCqaa	you get a pevy raptor they are amazing|`|9LqpLxZmaa	well ive been playing for almost 2 years and my first guitar was a dean evo it was about a hundred bucks at guitar center or you could get a squiar (i dont know how to spell it) but there about the same price but there not good. hope this helps!|`|LMUwz5y8aa	I recommand you the Fender Stratocaster, That costs around 190$|`|4ujEpNLsaa	I agree with some of the others a Fender Squier is a good beginner guitar.|`|6wNbnZNKaa	fender squire. guitar center has em for $100 for the guitar or $200 for the guitar and extras|`|Cp5uKD20aa	This comes with everything you need to start:  http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/produ...

r374ljoGaa	OKAY THIS IS NOTTTTTTTTT MY ANSWERR I WAS ALSO VERRYY CONFUSED ABOUT THE END SO I WENT ON HERE AND SEARCHED IT HAHA AND I FOUND THIS ANSWER AND IT HELPED ME SOO MUCHH THIS ANSWER IS FROM "BEAVISKR" SO I DONT HAVE CREDIT FOR THISSS  !  hahha okay just wanted to make sure people didnt think i stole it from the personn but yeah this answer helped me so much :    "well you have to think about it all. in the flashback it shows anna (the main girl) leaving a party early cus that guy was tryin to hook up with her and she goes home and sees her dad having sex with the nurse. so she goes and gets a bucket of gas and looks like she is planning on killing the nurse somehow (im not really sure how, it does show her looking at a map of the house) then she leaves the gas faucet on by accident and her sister slams the door and the a candle falls over, then her moms bell rings and so alex (the sister) goes back in the outhouse to help, and then the gas hits the candle and blows up the outhouse. im not completely sure whether the dad and everyone knew that anna started the fire (i think they do know) but either way she cuts herself and the dad sends her to a psych ward and she cant remember anything from that night. as she is leaving the psych ward the last advice the doctor gives her is "finish what you started." she is by now, completely insane and imagines her sister still being alive. she imagines her step mom being some crazy killer who killed those little kids by drugging them and stabbing them. it is just stuck in her head, ever since he saw her having sex with her dad, that her step mom is a horrible person. im assuming that the shots the step mom gave anna were medicine to calm her or sedate her until she calmed down because everyone except anna knows that she is crazy. she then imagines the sister killed the step mom and finally comes to reality when her dad is screaming at her. she realizes she killed the step mom and then remembers what really happened that night. she remembers how the boyfriend actually saw her start the fire and when he tells her that he knows...she drops him off the cliff. the step mom didnt want the boyfriend coming around the house because she didnt want him reminding anna of what really happened that night. so when she killed the step-mom she "finished what she started." pretty confusing (especially the imagined sister) but im pretty sure thats it. as for mildred kemp, im pretty sure there was no real significance of her other than to just prove that the step-mom was actually completely innocent, which is sad because she was so hot. haha hopes this helps. i actually thought the movie was pretty good, definitely made you think"    ^ if you are still confused just search yahoo answers for "the uninvited ending" and alot will pop up just click and read til you get it :) haha|`|iqb1R6U0aa	the step mom and sister were not real she imagened them

AZtlB3VMaa	Yes, Edward is jealous of Jacob because he can clearly see that Bella loves him, and that Jacob can do things for her that he can never do, such as keep her warm and go out in sunlight. Jacob, though a werewolf, is still part human and Edward would give anything to be human, and so he will always be envious of him for that. Also, when Bella kissed Jacob and enjoyed it, that hurt him.      But he has no reason to be jealous because Edward's perfect and Bella always wanted to be with him more anyway.       Hope this helps!|`|c3Kay8Z3aa	I think Edward maintains a level of jealousy throughout the series until the last book...    http://home.comcast.net/~pjhinfo/site/?/...|`|R5mmX9Woaa	I thought he was|`|LhPzxAtIaa	oh yeaaaa. he is sooo jealous. hes mad that jacob can be there for bella and live a normal life istead of the eternal life thing with edward. and how he's really hot (temperature wise) when hes a wolf and can warm her up when she's cold...(closer to the end of the book)|`|pKlKJR4qaa	I'd guess so|`|gWXjNa4gaa	I didn't get the feeling of jealousy from Edward at all, in any book of the series. I think Edward is far too cocky to ever be jealous of Jacob.|`|aCGvnZQHaa	I think he is (as usual)|`|At2JL4MVaa	Nope, all he wants is for Bella to be okay.|`|l10h4yqeaa	I think he is Jealous because Bella cares so much for him and he could give her everything that Edward can't.|`|hdU5wkguaa	yea but he's uber mature and can control himself (to the public eye)|`|Md47g4tWaa	he is jealous and he wishes he were normal so bella can live normally with him...he doesnt want bella to miss any part of being human...such sacrifice....    edward...*sigh* what a good guy :)|`|D3agflP1aa	no actually he is not jelous he wants to keep bella happy and safe if she said she wanted to be with jacob he wouldnt argue he would let her|`|FtOylJg9aa	yes, Edward is jealous of Jacob because he knows that Jacob can give Bella everything she wants and still be human and that he can actually touch her and not have to concentrate on trying not to kill her every second. so ya Edward is jealous of Jacob. TEAM EDWARD :)|`|HhmhSBpgaa	I think its the other way Jacob is jealous of edward. Edward keeps his distance from jacob and is uncomfortable around him because of the pact they made because of the vamps and werewolves. I felt they were both jealous.|`|ovIgqWQCaa	yes he is, but he wants Bella to be happy so he tries to hide it. but jacob is jealous of Edward and vise versa but they both want bella to choose what she wants with her life and don'tt fight about it because they don't want her to feel bad and like it is her fault.
zm5RYyVHaa	Metallica or Suicidal Tendencies....Both are great metal songs to learn on Bass. If you get those down pat, you're good. Why do you think Metallica took in Bob T.?

In fact, I encourage you to read it, then, when he does something that you don't like, I would say to him:      *sigh*  "Why can't you be more like Edward?"      That would be hilarious.      But don't be worried. It's an amazing book.

Twilight is awesome|`|fIkriTAQaa	No!|`|MJb0AZCPaa	No no no heck no. Don't worry about it - when he starts dressing up in your clothes, acting more like a girlfriend than a boyfriend and hits on guys, now THEN you can worry.|`|aQvjsFanaa	yea, you really should. and if you ever catch him watching you as you sleep, END IT!|`|3SsKTZcCaa	If you are not planning to marry that guy dont worry.   He might realize he is gay in 20 years :)|`|ddkzojaDaa	Hahaha.

pAVKfe5Maa	Well, I came across this video in YouTube that has some celebrities' email addresses and contact number. And they have Miley's email and contact number. Well, but you'll never know if they are really the celebrities' email and number, or just posers. But there's this YouTube member who posted a comment on this video saying that she called Miley. A man picked up the phone, it wasn't Miley's dad. Then she said that she said can i speak to Miley and then the guy really passed the phone to Miley! And so she talked to Miley! And there are also some people who posted comments saying that those are real celebrity email address and contact number. The user who said that he/she talked to Miley is aimzindahouse. This is what she wrote- i phoned miley cyrus but it was a man and it wasnt billy rae cyrus it was sum1 else i said is this miley cyrus's number and he said yh would u like to talk t her and i said YES PLEASE and i talked to her it was AWESOME !!!!

Natalie always has to fight her own battles and stick up for herself because Clint & Viki are too busy pampering and babying Jessica.|`|d5K8wORqaa	did u forget its not natalies fault?

But Nat was wrong in saying that Jess isn't safe for Bree and Chloe.|`|EQP8VZwiaa	I'm with you.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	Both Natalie and Jess-Tess-Bess need to be slapped up the back side of the head. Siblings!! Can't live with them and you can't kill them. Nash's death was an accident. I do not feel sorry for any of them. Especially Jessica because she still wishes Nat would be dead. sheesh!  Next!|`|3d40b4f2a24630bfafce9bb96d212203aa	Personally, I don't like Natalie and wish she wasn't Vickie's daughter but that is just me. I know Nash wasn't exactly a saint but natalie should feel a bit guilty, no she didn't push him but the argument could have been handed better. I just don't like how Natalie goes around acting like she does no wrong and woe is me the world is out to get me, all she does is whines. I use to like her when she first came on when she was spunky but now all she does is whines. I mean she is marrying someone that was going after her family when he first came to town. She she shouldn't play the blame game. Personally, Tess should had came out and slap the *****.|`|AA11785312	i don't agree    Nash was making bad deals and freaked out when the truth came out about Jared  Jared was just trying to get him off of Natalie which Jessica never seemed to understand it's not like they intentionally pushed him   Jessica did nearly kill Jared and Natalie and Viki and Jared's dad and her kids  Chole doesn't even know Jessica and Bree seemed scared of her so Natalie saying that worked.....she has been acting as a mother to the girls since she was let out of the basement    granted Chloe is actually Starr's Kid since Tess didn't go to the Dr. the RH factor makes sense with that one since she had giving birth before    i am waiting for someone to figure out that Chloe is Starr's|`|nndflDc9aa	I cant believe she wanna raise Bree for revenge. She need to make babies with Jared if she love kids tha much . LOl get ur own kids.

gJhwH335aa	Yeah... kinda... seeing Piccolo dressed and acting like one of the villain from Power Rangers. Checked. Seeing Piccolo has a bunch of idiotic team like the one they used in Power Rangers. Checked. Seeing the team of bad guys are wearing the same spandex suit like the Power Rangers. Checked. Seeing the main guy is American and learning Kung Fu. Checked. Seeing the main character goes to school and learning he is the chosen one to stop evil. Checked. Yeah, you pretty much got a point there.    I think the movie will be just mediocre as I was hoping the movie will be flop though. If that happen, the film maker would probably realized their mistake, and decided to re-booting the series and follow the original storyline as closer as they can much like they did with the Hulk movie.    Now, it looks like the movie is just borrowing some of the character's name and the theme of gathering 7 Dragon Balls. Other than that, this movie is probably less than 10% adaptation from the manga and anime counterpart. Akira Toriyama would be devastated to see another person ruined his series (after DBGT) just because they think it's a good idea to continue Dragon Ball legacy. -__-"|`|gM9RguFeaa	i don't thing so  i mean they never wore helmets before.|`|P8Qrds77aa	To me it just looks BAD.|`|btFSgJmlaa	No, to me it looks more like a Matrix rip off.

7sFNyeOhaa	Yes, he is.|`|cRhkkBAEaa	I would think so.    I agree with your additional details totally.  The MJ haters are FILLED with jealousy.    In my opinion, if Michael is a Christian, then he became a Christian some time between 2004 and now - that's without me going into details with my reasons for thinking.     Lots of fans seem to worship Michael, I must agree though.   I dont worship Michael, but I do love him with all my heart.  I am a Christian so I worship God.    Michael did used to be a Jehovahs Witness up until about 1985 or somewhere around there.  But, nobody knows what religion he is.    But he is certainly not a Muslim. He visited Bahrain for a few months   in 2005-2006, and while he was there he went out disguised in like, all the black clothes they wear, which he why people seem to think he had converted to Islam.    But his spokesperson says he has not.    See www.mjwn.co.uk for the latest news.|`|1H7Z3Pivaa	Because he seems to be the only artist so far and is alive to have the rare combination of talent and charisma and through the years people have seen that he has developed and honed it. With that combination he excelled in his ability for artistic execution that can move viewers. Usually when an art work does that, the viewer usually attribute the work as seemingly divine and having been moved with the hand of god himself especially when he not only has talent but moves effortlessly and gracefully with it. Maybe others just say he is a god or are just so overwhelmed with his performance, they tend to react exaggeratedly but really they say, he is so highly gifted!    He was raised strictly by his mom as a Jehovah Witness but he was not baptized. But as his career progressed the values taught there didn't seem to jive with the lifestyle of someone in showbiz. Recently there have been reports that he converted to Islam, not sure of the reliability of the reports though. But in some of his albums, he'd have songs with christian theme or tone. As a Jehovah though, he did attend Sunday church services when he was young and also did door to door proselytism.|`|m7nrQEflaa	He is awesome! I love MJ!|`|AA10026476	Did MJ switched his nose?|`|Orx9cTJJaa	He use to be a Jehovah's Witness, then when he made Thriller he was disfellowshipped  because it's talking about the dead rising in a way..against their beliefs. Other wise, I have no idea.|`|kR6hptDvaa	They worship Him ? But I don't.......................And he is a Muslim........ 'Zai eee'|`|YTLePvkVaa	No he converted to Islam.|`|xoVA08Zaaa	No he is a freak of nature|`|BZMPax7Naa	Well since both Michael Jackson, Ted Haggard, and Catholic Priests all like men and young boys.  I guess he fits right in|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	Hes a Jehovah Witness...one of the craziest religions out there|`|4WjB4tHjaa	umm no!    he's an islam now!    he kinda reminds me of ozzie osbourne|`|79742c6af3ce8b6a79acffa1c263de4aaa	IMO he's just a sad, pathetic plastic retard who doesn't get it at all.    It's sad.  He was such an awesome,untouchable artist in the 80s.  Such a talent!  A talent unrivaled.    He just got too fugging wierd. And too many nose jobs & eyebrow lifts.  And tattooed eyeliner.  I mean--I like eyeliner and all, but his is WAY too thick!    What made him so strange?  As girls go--he's not very pretty.  Sorry...truth tho|`|IHUS8wsbaa	I like your question. He is a christian, but i think its wrong to worship someone even if you are a fan. Even haters worship hating him. Im a fan, but i know he cuts and bleeds like everyone i like what you said    Are you people all the same kind of evil?  why do people hate on other people they can never be?  humans always hate what they can't conquer in this case it would have to be M.J's money, fame, and talent.        are you a fan?/?|`|tuvlFJdsaa	he was and then he moved to saudi arabia and converted to islam|`|Xlb8QPj9aa	In a boy's mind, maybe.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	I don't see how he could be. Unless it's the "Jesus Juice" that gave it away.|`|27e8621704a7c55b0a61c68c284ec23eaa	he is now islamic,  but i believe he still offers jesus juice to his overnight guests.

suVispAAaa	Just to get through the challenges of every day life & get through it one day at a time. Other then that i am still searching for my purpose here on earth & trying to search for the meaning of my life everyday! What i listed above is the only thing i can think of right now.|`|t5SPwLZeaa	Well in my opinion the meaning of life is to see how it is like to conquer all challenges everyday of your life . . But i still dont get the meaning of school - you go to school and then you get a great job and then you die .. Hmm... I still like school though its better than home .. :P|`|8SbgHDqfaa	Something to waste.
fJt5zRTXaa	Mind Control  Invisibility  Flying  X-ray vision  Superhuman strength   Shape shifting   Time Travel|`|QEqGukjZaa	something like Wolverine..|`|rzY4XM6gaa	Be able to breathe underwater (probably my fav)  Understand every language (second fav)  Speak to animals  Fly  and....  Invisibility would be cool too.    :)|`|RNpaBwxzaa	Oh my goodness. EVERYONE who answers these questions always say the same things: either flight, invisibility, mind reading, x-ray vision, or the ability to change the past or see the future. There is so much wrong with all those powers.  Flight: just because you can fly doesn't mean your body is able to cope with high wind speeds, low oxygen levels, and near-freezing temperatures.  Invisibility: You'll have to strip butt-naked every time you want to be slealthy, avoid carpet and grass and such because your footprints will show, avoid water like the plague because it'll show you're there, and you'll still be vulnerable to motion detectors and such.  Mind reading: You think you want to know what people are thinking, but once you find out you'll regret it. Plus, scanning another person's personal thoughts without their permission is totally unethical.  X-ray vision: Useful only for perverts.  Changing the past: Ever see Back to the Future? The Butterfly Effect? Messing with the past will ALWAYS end up with serious unpredectable consequences.  Seeing the future: Totally implausible. A timeline's future is in a constant state of flux. You may be able to see probable future events, but nothing you see will ever be set in stone.    I personally, will choose the ability to desintigrate matter with a touch, absorb the matter's potential energy, and then use that evergy to temporarily boost any of my body's normal functions (strength, speed, sensory function, thought procession, ect...) to super-human levels.|`|qS4EG5qYaa	invisibility-   so wen im sad i can just disapear or i can make ppl think theres a ghost hehehe    knowing what ppl r thinking-that wuld b awesum    and duplicating things- lets say i have $50. i culd make it into 2 $50 etc|`|CY7rPa6oaa	too read minds  too be invisible  see the futur  be able too breath under water  attract people to me   to influence what people feel  and like 10000000000 more thing which i can not be bothered to write|`|UmlLFh4raa	hmmm....    id say...  trasformative powers  mind reading  elemental powers (ex fire, water, earth, air...)

Oo that's right, I just answered your question with a question!|`|hB7no5bPaa	YES ! Doesn't everyone? You have to know when to stop wiping!|`|iwuxOv3iaa	Erm....  I don't check until I sense that I'm "clean".  Then, I'll peek to see how much more is necessary....|`|7kDY9svdaa	Yep. I must admit I wish more guys did where I live. I've met a few guys who didn't wipe and clean themselves and left "smears" or want me to touch their butt and it is just nasty to deal with a unclean guy besides turn off let alone see leftover unclean residue. I know TMI but just I hope maybe some guys think twice and make sure, a female likes a "clean" guy.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	Yeah, and sometimes I take pictures.
V1hxvQukaa	i know why!    the album "three cheers for sweet revenge" is labeled explicit. "i brought you my bullets, you brought me your love" isn't labeled explicit because that CD came out on an indie record company. indie companies don't need to put the tipper sticker (the explicit content sticker) on their CDs. "three cheers for sweet revenge" came out on warner bros. music (i think), which is a major record company, so they needed to label it explicit.|`|MeGazyy7aa	That's a good question! Is one of them on Life On The Murder Scene? EVERY song on Life On The Murder Scene is labeled explicit!|`|vlIXsFmhaa	Yes this is RHH but in Young Buck's album Buck The World, The last track is listed as Funeral Music. In reality the last track is Losin' My Mind and Funeral Music is a hidden track.|`|ocWsnPjWaa	Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is explicit, and thats what Ghost of You is on. I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, which is what Our Lady of Sorrows is on isn't.    ...which is really weird, considering Three Cheers drops the F-bomb once or twice maybe, and Bullets is worse XD|`|5kxsEuYuaa	Yeah I don't understand how they decide what's explicit, because they choose the oddest songs. haha|`|XM7WXyEQaa	that's weird  probably cause bullets was underground ( no one bothered to give it a rating) and 3cheers was more popular   they do do swear in 3 cheers but not in the ghost of you not even in the live version maybe they thought of it as a part of the album    but gee pops the f word more than once in our lady   maybe the people in i tunes are to lazy to check bullets out

Tdx3zB66aa	It did once. I happened in a hotel twenty years ago when a man I was talking with... well I'll not say here in answers. Other than that my answer is no. Human touch that's not aimed at hurting someone is nurturing and beneficial. As a matter of fact just this morning the reverse was true when I hugged someone who had been very agitated last night and even some still this morning. Only slightly surprisingly I was told "thank you" and knew once again what it means. It's funny that you asked this question when you did. Say... do you read minds? :)  Well, that's what I was told eons ago when young and also what my own experiences have taught me :) ?

YiY9Yd2Jaa	They forgot to draw in wardrobes?|`|bkgBLjuvaa	i don't know, why either  ! ?|`|1Ri3zxqWaa	Beaucause it's suppose to be funny?|`|mj3LBE3laa	in maisy (the show with the stupid mouse that doesnt talk) she changes clothes everytime she goes in a new room|`|UeANfVBFaa	the wrihters are really lazy|`|vqg6wpCLaa	I personally think that they do this because it is too difficult to always be changing the clothing for every single character. Also, I find that giving a character a very limited wardrobe makes them unique and differentiates them from other characters. There is something about a character's wardrobe that tells you something about them and their personality and it really gives them more depth, even if that's hard for you to believe.    To person above: it is cartoons, not anime, that the asker was talking about.|`|P8gGMlbIaa	Because it's easier to draw a character in the same clothes. Let's see you sit down and draw a new wardrobe for each episode.    Don't forget in Japan the school students wear a school uniform, and odds are they most all look a like.    However I've seen plenty of anime where the characters do change their clothes. So what have you been watching?|`|NfSwYjYBaa	i know! its pretty gross huh? the people who draw it must be to uncreative to come up with a new outfit. how sad. and its even stupider when its those animes where everyone is super rich. you have money but no change of clothes......?

Scariest friggen thing ever...and the worst part is it's true...gah...|`|XPObDMnyaa	A couple of years ago, when I was 23 years old... my car broke down and I drove as far as it would go. I ended up in front of an old beat-up house. I walked up to the scratched, old and worn out door. I knocked a couple of times until a sweet little old couple answered. They insisted that I stay until the morning when they could get some help.    At first I was scared to say yes but I thought they were nice enough, so I took them up on their generous offer. They cooked me a delicious meal and we all went to bed. As we passed a door to go to the bedroom they showed me was mine for the night they told me, "Do not go into our daughter's room". I thought it was kind of strange but it wasn't my house so I respected their request.    I woke up in the middle of the night around 3 o'clock to go to the bathroom. I was curious so I peeked under the door of the daughter's room. I saw a little girl sitting in a chair facing the wall. I assumed she must have been punished and did not want me to bother her. So I went to the bathroom and then back to bed.    A couple of hours later, around 4:30 am, I became real thirsty. I needed to get some water so I got back up and headed for the kitchen. As I passed by the daughter's room, I was still so curious. I peeked in the key hole this time. All I saw was red so I assumed they must have painted the whole room red, including the key hole.    When I woke up in the morning, I went downstairs and thanked the old couple very much for letting me stay. They said it was no problem and asked how my night was. I said "it was good" and complimented them on the color of the paint job in their daughter's room. They said "what paint job". I then asked if their was anything special about their daughter. They said she died a couple of years ago and had one red eye.    I realized that the red I saw was nothing more than the daughter looking back at me, through the keyhole.    I love that one...|`|GGpkMLwUaa	Once upon a time cats came to inveade earth.

Policemen went to investigate. Trying not to tread on the bodies, the police took pictures of each one. One policemen saw something on the opposite wall but he couldn't read it. He walks over to it and sees the numbers "7734" in calculator form, written in blood. When taking pictures of this he turned his camera upside-down and told an approaching police officer. When he pointed with the hand that the camera was in, he accidentally took a picture of the upside-down numbers. The policeman was about to delete the picture when he realized something. The numbers were now a word. The word was "HELL."|`|dOSOr5bNaa	The reports had been on the radio all day, though she hadn't paid much attention to them. Some crazy man had escaped from the state asylum. They were calling him the Hook Man since he had lost his right arm and had it replaced with a hook. He was a killer, and everyone in the region was warned to keep watch and report anything suspicious. But this didn't interest her. She was more worried about what to wear on her date.       After several consultation calls with friends, she chose a blue outfit in the very latest style and was ready and waiting on the porch when her boyfriend came to pick her up in his car. They went to a drive-in movie with another couple, then dropped them off and went parking in the local lover's lane. The blue outfit was a hit, and she cuddled close to her boyfriend as they kissed to the sound of romantic music on the radio.     Then the announcer came on and repeated the warning she had heard that afternoon. An insane killer with a hook in place of his right hand was loose in the area. Suddenly, the dark, moonless night didn't seem so romantic to her. The lover's lane was secluded and off the beaten track. A perfect spot for a deranged mad-man to lurk, she thought, pushing her amorous boyfriend away.     "Maybe we should get out of here," she said. "That Hook Man sounds dangerous."     "Awe, c'mon babe, it's nothing," her boyfriend said, trying to get in another kiss. She pushed him away again.     "No, really. We're all alone out here. I'm scared," she said.     They argued for a moment. Then the car shook a bit, as if somethingor someonehad touched it. She gave a shriek and said: "Get us out of here now!"     "Jeeze," her boyfriend said in disgust, but he turned the key and went roaring out of the lover's lane with a screeching of his tires.     They drove home in stony silence, and when they pulled into her driveway, he refused to help her out of the car. He was being so unreasonable, she fumed to herself. She opened the door indignantly and stepped into her driveway with her chin up and her lips set. Whirling around, she slammed the door as hard as she could. And then she screamed.     Her boyfriend leapt out of the car and caught her in his arms. "What is it? What's wrong?" he shouted. Then he saw it. A bloody hook hung from the handle of the passenger-side door.|`|ouajYTdpaa	You didn't go to the dentist for years because you were afraid of the drill and, the bill.|`|GYi7V2Jsaa	once a very long time ago their were no cell phones!!!!!!!!

DzIlM76Xaa	A cell phone in a public toilet a few years ago. The bathroom and toilet looked clean, I made a decision, I grabbed it, I pocketed it, I washed my hands vigorously, then again, then I forgot to pee, I couldn't pee, I was too shaken up, the store was too noisy, I was baked, and I was late to meet the hookup. I rinsed it, let it air dry for days, then used alcohol and God knows what else to hopefully sanitize it. It worked just fine. But it was a toilet phone after all.

JnuU4c5raa	Just dubs is being upgraded right now. It will be back online this coming Monday, February 2nd I think.|`|6FPpkmi6aa	Ummmm...what do you mean? I don't get, what ep. or show are you talking about?
3N2ElzcQaa	I really agree with you on that one.    I dislike fans on youtube whining about how horrible the dubbed voices are. When I heard and watched this tiny clip of Ouran being dubbed, the people who watched it was so annoying. These two girls were moaning so loud and I wanted to hear how the voices were sounding.     I happen to love both subbed and dubbed versions of anime. I'm starting to listen to some German One Piece episodes, and they aren't that bad. I think most of the voice actors and actresses have talent. Its just a matter of training and experience. Studio Ghibli is one of my favorite companies for dubbing Miyazaki's films like Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. Studio Ghibli is awesome. And, the Disney movies being dubbed in other countries were great as English ones. (another note: I hate the complainers)    And, for people who complain about the voices, they should at least try out the whole episode instead of just listening to the clip for 3 seconds. After they 3 seconds, they start to explode and make this huge rant on how terrible the dubbed voices are. Its so stupid. They'll use the Capslock and exclamation points to make it exaggerating.    I grew up with watching anime being in English dubbed, and they aren't so bad when I listen to them as a kid. Now, at that point in my childhood life, I didn't know that 4Kids had ruined all anime. 4Kids have tarnish all anime, re-editing, and cutting out every single thing. Its very unbearable to watch and listen at the same time.    I'm sorry for the long rant. I thought I should express my opinions as well.|`|P8gGMlbIaa	I'm not opposed to dubs, no problems with watching anime either way. But I think Bandai and Fumimation have had the better dubs since Geneon stopped.    I hate VIZ with a passion, they don't listen to fans as much as you think they do. If they do now they're just trying to fix their broken reputation, but it's now too late to forgive them.    With Bandai it not a question of if, it more a question of when.|`|gvOi9h60aa	usually eng dub sounds like a bunch of emotionless drones  i prefer subs because even though i dont understand what   theyre saying i atleast can feel the emotion in their voices    only eng dubs i liked are ruroni kenshin because he actually sounds like a man  inuyasha and DBZ|`|P8Q39vA4aa	If you want to get technical and true the word otaku is an insult in the japanese language so i dont use it.     Well whats wrong is this the voice actor matchups to the characters are horrible.     And really this seems like a rant to me.     I seriously think you should stop using the word otaku its an insult it means overly obsessed fan to the point of stalkerish, its a stereotype and not a good word whatsoever.     I prefer subs to dubs. Not saying dubs are bad its just my personal preference. I think you need to get over it, people can choose to like what they want.|`|btFSgJmlaa	They're not n00bish, they're otaku of the highest degree.      Obsessive and are trying to be something they're not.    As for One Piece, thank whatever higher being you pray to that FUNI got it from 4Kids.|`|t2SGVG1Vaa	I agree. Haha, I don't really know what else to say other than that ^-^*|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	i prefer when they're dubbed to english.|`|F60JZOU3aa	i totally agree with you i prefer dubbed, but some are badly dubbed,|`|SptW7fDCaa	Please read all through before hating me...    First of all I don't know any Subbed fan that is a 'N00B', so umm...yeah..    Secondly you can't tarnish the 'otaku' name. It's like saying that they are tarnishing the 'nerd' name. Anyways, if you are limiting yourself to dubs you are not much of an anime otaku. (I'm not accusing you of this, but for the fans out there who do.)     I prefer subs, but I hate people who are like "OMG!!! SUBS ONLY!!! Dubs suck!!" and vice versa. I don't spread the hate on dubs, but I do prefer subs. There are some good english voice actors out there. In some series the English versions are very well done.    The problem with some dub fans are that they are newer fans and don't know a lot about anime. Many of them prefer dubs without truly giving subs a chance. They argue with fans who have been watching anime for a much longer time(this isn't always the case, but it's more often than not. I know some fans that have been watching anime for 10-20 years who prefer dubs). The sad part is that it's such a pointless argument. Instead of arguing you could be sharing the joys and angers of various series.|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	i only like a few dubs. mostly the original voices just sound better and real. inuyasha dub for example, is okay but they made kagome sound annoying and they translated some stuff weirdly, i.e. they had demons call inuyasha, "little man"....lol...why not half-breed? does that sound too racist to the dubbers?|`|RVpl9ZeIaa	Thank you. Seriously, some people just like to whine and complain over the choices that are made. They don't want their precious anime ruined by poor voice acting, although I can't really complain. I watch both subs and dubs.      And I'll agree with this, 4KIDS = FAIL. They butchered One Piece, GX and 5Ds. ;~;|`|HRQjffv8aa	Hmmm..    Well i dont really like dub, actually i kind of hate it most of the time. I dont think i can call myself an otaku and i dont want to call myself one, i dont try to say japanese words or anything. Its just to me most of the times the dubs are bad, or well the ones ive seen at least. I watch more sub than dub obviously.    But i do watch dub from time to time, i watch those that show on tv, for example fma, rurouni kenshin and darker than black,cardcaptor sakura and i have to say those dubs are good compared to other dubbed versions.    I've been watching dubbed animes for years, since i was a kid like 6 yrs old, ive only started watching subbed animes recently, maybe only starting last year, so i liked it much much better than the dubbed version.    So.. what im saying is, i like sub much more than dub but i still watch dubbed versions if they come up on tv.    Well thats my opinion.|`|Dy14VNebaa	that is soo true! i hate the subtitles becaues if u focus too much on them your gonna miss the action of the show! dubbed is waay better than subbed.thats why im waiting naruto shippuiden to come out in english dub! naruto's english voice is funny and love his laugh! i also love gaara's emotionless voice too! i dont see anything worng with dubs and i cant atand sub fans sometimes because they think its more ethenthic to watch it subbed and they think if u dont watch it subbed ur not a real anime or manga fan. but  oh well what they think !!!!|`|NfSwYjYBaa	I like some in english. some in japanese. it just depends how much is dubbed and if they sound crappy.|`|m7Q8Gjq1aa	you shouldn't dislike a group of people just because they like something - only when they get obsessive. If someone refuses to watch an anime series because they can't get their hands on the original japanese version with subs (it's a hypothetical situation, it doesn't have to be possible) well then that's just silly.   English dubbed versions don't totally destroy the story line, you'll find that it generally is the same, they just might not say the suffixes (eg "sama" and "chan").   I've only ever watched one subbed anime, Vampire Knight and that's only because it wasn't in english - and i found it annoying how i had to read what they said, then look at the characters face, it sort of disjoints the experiance of watching the show if you don't know the language it's in.|`|VLRkJOOuaa	I don't hate the people who don't like dubbed anime, but I think it's annoying that they think that's the only "authentic, real" type of anime out there. Not every dubbed anime series is going to be an epic fail, you know?    Some people are just innate at being so demographically-led. I don't see the point in hating dubbed anime... it's practically the same thing. My friend's excuse is "they have swear words... haha." I look at her like "wtf?!?!" every time, because that doesn't really mean anything to me.    As long as the plot is the same -- or maybe even altered for the better -- I don't care WHAT language it is in.        P.S. -- Wouldn't it be cool if they subbed anime in Hawaiian?!?! I'd watch it like that ALL the time. (:|`|Ttf7867jaa	i buy all of the animes i want in subs. i do appreciate that they improve their efforts on dubbing... but some jokes in japanese when translated into english lose their original meaning.|`|XNIkS3KNaa	Everyone has their own opinion on things so it doesn't bother me when people don't like dubbed anime or if people don't like subbed anime.  It's up to each person.  Some animes are not so great dubbed for example Cardcaptor Sakura.  Originally it has 70 episodes, but the dubbed version of it was cut short and many details of the series was left out.  So sometimes when people don't like dubbed anime it's not so much about the voice actor, it's more about the missing pieces in dubbed animes.  Although it's only on SOME, not all are like that which is why I don't mind when anime is subbed or dubbed.  I watch both, but everyone is entitled in there own opinion just like you are. :)
y3lBLqIOaa	as a musician you can mess up and let the audince know u messed up by stopping and staring over or as a musician u can mess up and keep going until u get it right.u and ur fellow musicians are going to be the only ones who know u messed up,the audience will never know if u keep going.    hope this helps.

During a concert, a mistake is going to happen, but you can't start over EVERY time you hit a wrong note, or play the wrong pattern.  The ability to just "keep going" is necessary and hugely important.

I was recently standing in line to order and pay for my calzone at a local pizza place when I saw one of the workers there lick some sauce off his hand, then he looked both ways to check to see if anyone saw him do that.  Didn't notice me looking at him.  Then he went and shoved his hands elbow deep into a tub of shredded mozzerella cheese! GROSS!!!  I canceled my order and told his boss, as well as the other patrons waiting in line, what I had just witnessed.  lol  The other patrons left as well.

WELL low and behold, all the physio DID NOT pay off! I worked my azz off all summer, just to play a month of volleyball and have the same knee dislocate in the FINALS in an important tournament! So that screwed over the rest of my volleyball season and about 7 months later i was scheduled for surgery, which completely trashed my entire badminton season. oh and did i mention i had to REDO physiotherapy?? and i now have to wear these awful braces on my knees every time i do pretty much anything physical. yah.   needless to say, i've lost my positive edge and am now quite a pessimist. i hate it. i'm really really trying to gain back my positive nature but it's so hard. so so hard.|`|4MJEWCjiaa	The worst thing  was when my daughter was killed in a car accident.

Like how he talked about making rhymes then verses and sprinkling lines and that other ish.    Buy, haven't heard the whole album but Too Heavy for Cherubs was fukced up.

uePD9IAXaa	My cousin has that vinyl one of the great ep's. It's actually by Scritti Politti the original bizrrely they are some offbeat rock band.    I like all the remixes and secretly wish i could pinch the EP of him. LOL well he did steal my Straight out of Compton and Death Certificate cassettes back in the day. Actually it's been tit-for-at thievery of fresh Hip Hop for nearly 20 years from one another.    Actually I've never heard that first one so the EP must just be the remixes.  It makes more sense because that one has more of a Rock sound to the Choruses.  There is also a Pete Rock and Rob Swift Version. From memory I think it was Pete's I liked the best.  http://www.discogs.com/Scritti-Politti-T...    Spray Can AKA Do it but Do it Big.|`|6fxr3VBGaa	Pen|`|RavvDVpVaa	I thought Pete Rock's remix and Ali Shaheed Muhammad's version were better|`|q4XUy0Duaa	I always liked the Beatnuts Remix more, but the singing in the hook on both versions is horrible.

If I'm doing graf on paper, I'll take the pencil for wildstyle, but the pen for simple throwies..|`|os6FaEBlaa	The remix is better, but barely.

If it were the 1700's and you crossed the dirt line made with a sword at the battle at the Alamo then you chose to stay and defend what you believe in, therefore crossing the line would be a good thing.    If you walked over a line like a crack in the sidewalk then congratulations! you arent paralyzed!    If you did something out of your comfort zone and were proud of your accomplishment then good job crossing the line...youve opened your life up to a whole new set of wonderful experiences!|`|2liwk8yKaa	If you are Johnny Cash reincarnated, you would be walking.|`|b2TkqoNBaa	it's possible|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	NO I see why you haven't|`|aLyJe1b3aa	.........................|`|f8d37f51816f93a01c3756a4f407dca2aa	I'm pretty sure you're just walking the line.|`|6ik7OJRNaa	..... and I'm waiting for you at the other side of the fence......    ......crossing the line is what takes that line further.....|`|P9K7AYmWaa	How do i freaking know.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	yes you did Lennon|`|q5DTcOuaaa	I think you did.    *20 lashes*|`|AA12383908	You sure did, now step back.|`|aPaPlEiCaa	yes several times|`|qsuYKa3naa	If you dotted you T's and crossed your eyes you did|`|zH7VuQhtaa	To quote Joey (from Friends) :     Cross the line!?

Then the cashiers get sooo confused!|`|isosFXBdaa	and whats wrong with that?|`|1dNZb7Y4aa	NO.  lol, never would i do that.   lol the 1 cent is funny btw.   =D|`|AAwe5WbVaa	no thatd be mean. considering i know how it feels :/|`|c6HfikOHaa	your satin in disguise|`|xoVA08Zaaa	You mean if it cost 100, right?  Probably- I don't want the penny.|`|O8XRgMu4aa	sure as long as i get $90.01 in change....|`|u8SeGmnZaa	ughhhh no|`|0PEVAuIkaa	Hahah I would be funny, and yes that's probably something I would do.  :)|`|9nymzoOXaa	ide do it to see the cashiers faciel expression.|`|YsH4NjUhaa	No. But I'm  a cashier at work sometimes and people have tried to do that to me.  But I think it's funny when they do that to my 70 year old employee.|`|PwVrqyIGaa	Probably no cause i'm not patient enough to watch them count my change coin by coin xDD|`|SH2ysn6faa	yeah that would be funy just yelln out random numbas to mess them up|`|ZAOzJAwwaa	wat? oh i get it ha ha i would soooo do that and yeah say random numbers they would get so ****** it would be so funny yes and ask for it in coins! xD ha ha good q!|`|1bT2Eyyjaa	neither|`|JJK0LC5Qaa	baha! that'd be funny. hell yeah i'd do it. especially to an old person.|`|mIM8UWidaa	Nope. That would totally confuse them.|`|Sih0xHJgaa	No...and besides the cashier is probably smart enough to just keep your penny and give you $90 back...even if we're not, it doesn't take long to count out change...like 10-20 seconds and besides it gives us something to do.|`|Gzd1eS33aa	No. Is this some sort of trick question?|`|614ec97289e8a012759cb2a59dc70efdaa	I wouldn't even take your 1 measly penny if I was your cashier. And no, I wouldn't do that. Cashier's get enough assholes and idiots everyday, why make their job harder?|`|otLK5QFzaa	yeah me and my friend did that once and this guy got really mad behind us. and the cashier was a mess. she didn't know how to count so she made up count.|`|Oxi99SvFaa	ch ....... nnoooo. wait who told you? was it that bald guy behind me? I knew I should've let him go first. So yea i guess I would.
xXMLwwyraa	Not with my close friends, but with the whole peer group, yes.  My close friends' tastes were similar to mine, that's why we were close friends, I guess!  The whole peer group, yes. They wanted to talk about boys and shopping the whole time, when I wanted to talk about Economics and Music.> But I loved to talk about accessories and make-up, so I guess that evened it out. I felt they were childish only sometimes.  They (not my close friends, only the others) used to crack dirty jokes for everything, and go berserk at words like 'ball', 'apple' and even 'spoon'! (I still don't know what 'spoon' stood for) I hated all that, so whereas that part of it was concerned, I never fit in.|`|aL8Pj3dtaa	yes, i think i am too smart and mature. also too innocent for my age, 16.|`|j2NckArRaa	yeah...  my friends think theyre so cool when really ive never met such immature people|`|k1Lx7tqCaa	i hang out wiht older people so nopee|`|4sW8MFxCaa	yes.  they call me "scene kid"  and i have completely different interests than them|`|tT6GMdHiaa	yea.... im quiet sometime and i only chill wit people that get loud and crazy lol|`|up363TZyaa	i feel like i don't fit in with ANYBODY sometimes.  i feel like i'm more accepted on here, because nobody knows me, and i can just be whoever i want.  is that weird? or sad? or normal? or true?  well .... i don't know.  i have enough friends to get by, but NO, i don't fit in with a lot of people for reasons in which i do not understand.|`|tLVZXLRSaa	Well with my friends circle in middle school, I thought I fit in but now I look back and I realize I didn't. But my best friends I have now, they're amazing. We're alike and different and the same time and I wouldn't change that.|`|Fhd9UqWtaa	Yes, I think they aren't nearly as emotionally mature as I am.      And if I say someone is immature compared to me.... Well, that person has issues they need to work out.|`|QKdpO2Wtaa	yeah|`|ecdcada0d4cd7693aecd620917146a91aa	...nope....i only hang out with losers that are as cool as me :)|`|UJ3u891Qaa	Yes I feel a little too mature for my age (19)  Problem is I dont really have any friends left.    Need to make new ones and my old ones I felt as if I didn't fit in  & was not enjoying myself because of it !    Find someone with the same interests  you will have a way better time|`|W8YnDdUoaa	these two girls i used to be kind of friends with a year ago  were sooo immature, like all they wud do was joke about stupid things and laugh, and their jks werent even funny, ugh it was so stupid.   but im not friends with them anymore:)
xbISxnmfaa	Yes! That guy was a total and complete douche bag. Yeah I noticed the wife holding her head down, I just figured she was ashamed and that she wasnt allowed to say anything. Those poor kids, I hope they never end up hating their dad. He had the nerve to call that woman an overweight, uneducated, redneck. WTH. I just wanted to slap him for being rude and disrespectful.|`|bBHlGs5waa	No.|`|0hT85XLzaa	British people are like that. The British are like the ugliest European people.|`|27e8621704a7c55b0a61c68c284ec23eaa	i did not see that one...    however, the one that sticks in my head is the one with the french guy who wiped his face with the wash cloth that his son used to wash the dog's private areas.|`|cYFAo75Yaa	she pick him and is letting it happen. good for her...|`|43YeLFG2aa	are you talking about the younger guy with the older women and the two tween daughters?? if so he is a real prick and the mom is only with him b/c shes going through a mid life crisis im sure...... shes a couger!!!!  lol|`|UB8Exav4aa	dont care about brits, they can go eat their fish and chips|`|BFUy85yWaa	yeah i seen that and i being a hick had to change the channel after he made a few too many rude comments bout hicks and to her or i probaly would of shot my tv. i alwasy knew there was a reason i hated brits.
35b1cf01233843e36ebe132a4a67ea01aa	There are six different films called "The Uninvited", but I'm assuming you mean the film released this year:    The movie begins with a young girl (Browning) and a boy lying on the beach at a party. After he tells her he loves her and he "has a condom," she gets up to leave. As she goes, her sister Alex (Kebbel) asks if everything is alright. On her way through the woods to her house, Anna encounters several white garbage bags. When she goes to open them, the corpse of a red-headed girl falls out. As Anna recoils, the girl's head snaps around and she speaks. Anna runs home. She then hears the bell that her mother, who is terminally ill, rings when she needs something. Anna is concerned because her mother is not supposed to be alone. However, when she goes up to her house, the boathouse her mother is in explodes in flames. It is then revealed that this is a dream that Anna is having.    She has been in a mental hospital since the death of her mother one year earlier, but her psychiatrist believes she is ready to leave. As Anna packs, another inmate comes in asking Anna who she will tell her stories to now that Anna is leaving. Anna's father takes her home, where she is joyfully reunited with her sister, who is upset when she hears that Anna did not receive any of the letters Alex wrote. Alex confronts her father, who ignores her. Anna is also reunited with Rachel, her mother's former nurse who is now dating Anna's father. Both Anna and Alex are suspicious of her. That night Anna has a nightmare of a hand crawling up her bed, but her sister comes in to comfort her. They discuss their feelings on Rachel.    The next day Anna meets with her former boyfriend Matt, who tells Anna he knows what really happened the night of the fire. However, Rachel comes before he can say any more and sends him away. That night Anna and Alex wonder if the fire that killed their mother was not an accident. The next day Anna and Rachel go into town so Anna can talk to Matt while Alex searches through Rachel's belongings. Rachel discusses her former patients with Anna, telling her that they only way she got though it was by reminding herself that the people she was caring for would be dead soon. She also showed Anna her pearls, saying they were a gift from her clients. Anna sees the little girl from her dream along with two little boys, but in a moment they are gone.    When Anna meets up with Matt, he tells her he will come to her house that night to tell her what he saw. However he does not come. That night she dreams he comes in her window and they begin kissing, but she realizes his back is broken. He grabs her arms as she backs away and she wakes up. Later that day they find Matt's body in the water with his back broken. Anna shows Alex the bruises on her arms where he grabbed her in the dream, saying she's not crazy.    Anna and Alex do research and learn that Rachel lied about her name. Anna confronts Rachel, who becomes angry and tells Anna that if she says anything Rachel will make sure she goes back to the mental hospital. That night Rachel has a dinner party that Anna inadvertently ruins after the red-haired girl comes out from under the stove, telling Anna that "she's next." Anna's father leaves on the day of Matt's funeral. While there they ghosts of the children lead Anna to their graves so she can learn their names. She does a search on the names, learning that the children were killed by their former nanny (it is implied she also kills their mother). In a picture Anna sees the mother wearing Rachel's pearls. Alex and Anna try to get to the pearls. Anna gets them but must leave Alex behind.    At the police station Anna explains everything, begging the police officer to hurry because Alex is still at the house. He leaves but brings back Rachel, who sedates Anna and takes her back to the house. As Rachel prepares to kill Anna Alex sneaks up behind her and the screen goes black. When Anna wakes up she follows a trail of blood outside to the dumpster where Rachel's body is lying. Alex appears, covered in blood, telling Anna she did what she had to. Anna's father arrived, but when Anna tried to explain what happened. He tells her Alex is dead.    It is revealed that Anna is the one holding the knife. A series of flashbacks reveal that every conversation Anna and Alex had was imaginary, Anna killed Matt, and on the night of the fire Anna arrived home to find Rachel and her father having sex. Disgusted, she went to the boathouse to fill a watering can with gasoline so she could burn down the house. She does not shut off the faucet all the way and when Alex arrives she knocks over a lantern. The boathouse explodes, killing Alex and her mother. Anna is arrested and it is revealed that the other inmate was the nanny who killed the children, which is where Anna got the idea.

AA12278670	No, honey, I can't...crush 'em first and put them in chocolate ice cream is the best way for me..still a little gritty and chalky, but easier to take. Chewing iron pills or prenatal vitamins was THE WORST---nausea--inducing, I tell ya! I can't swallow pills no matter the size, I always think I'm gonna choke and won't be able to breathe and die...so most often if I'm in pain, I will just ride it out...sleep it off, read it off or hot-water-bottle it off. ;)|`|RwY6mk43aa	Yeah.|`|5nzKloSYaa	yah but i cant dry swallow|`|oNxq0oCYaa	i have to every morning, so yeaa|`|wXx0tMxnaa	yes..|`|ENCAZO7Paa	It's hard.

G5weg8gCaa	1 omg! This is the saddest Rin and Sesshomaru Fanfiction I've ever read in my entire life! I actually cried for a long time!!!  http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2576639/1/    ~I never knew that Sesshomaru will actually love Rin. Is this going to happen in the show... wait never mind because I don't want you to spoil the show lol. To tell you the truth, I actaully hate reading long stories, but I was into this one. Thanks for sharing.    2 would you rather spend the entire day watching your most hated anime show, or spending the entire day with your most hated anime character?  ==>> I would rather spend it with my most hated character because, I guess being able to actually meet Kikyo would be a great honor since shes from my absolute fave anime, even if shes a *****, plus I would like to get to know her better since I dont really know why I hate her :P (plz, I dont want to start any arguments)    ~I would also rather spend it with my most hated character.    3 How often do you watch anime in one day?  ==>> For me it depends. Either I watch a couple episodes from random animes, dont watch anime at all, or if I found a new anime I like, I dont stop watching it unless I'm busy or if I finish it.    ~Omg, I watch soooo much that I even start to get a headache. Like maybe 15 episodes or more. I can be a feak sometimes. Like for an example, I watch Inuyasha from morning to afternoon, then I get a rest and then I watch it again in the night. Its not my fault that Inuyasha has to be soooo good. Since I am on the computure pretty long, my mom starts to shout at me and she would say " YOU ARE GOING TO GET BLIND SOON FROM BEING ON THE COMPUTURE FOR SO LONG. GET OFF AND DO SOMETHING ELSE LIKE CHORES". It gets really annoying when she says that.   (-_-)    4 Your walking alone through the woods and you hear someone yell "Die *insert you name here*!" It turns out to be your fave character. How do you react  ==>> Sesshomaru! NOOOO!!! Please let me live!!! And than I would go hug him and hope he will change his mind (at the same time enjoy being so close to him ;)    I will be like " NO Inuyasha, but I thought we were meant for each other (*maybe only in my dreams*), I know it would work out, just don't kill me. I could be better than Kagome".    5 Wanna ask something random?    *~*~*~*~*~*BONUS*~*~*~*~*~*    ~Umm... Are they still going to make more episodes of Inuyasha, or does it just stop from 167?    6 Fans of Vampire Knight and Vampire Knight Guilty; I am interested in watching the anime, but I can't find it in english, do you know any reliable sites?    ~I had the same problem as you did. I tried to find Vampire Knight in dubbed english but it was too imposible. The reason for that is because they had not yet made the dubbed version of Vampire knight. You would only find fan dubbed which sounds really stupid. Just wait a year and you will find the dubbed version for the show.|`|gM9RguFeaa	1.Too long, finish later.  2.Watching most hated anime i can't spend a whole day with Tenten.  3.same, but i try to finish the one i started, but i usually end up on starting new ones :D  4. i'd say"NOOOOoooo!!! Gaara!" Then give him a cookie and spend the day together (maybe we'll even play with strings ^.^)  5.Why does gaara where a turtle neck when he lives in the desert?  6.Nope i watched all of it dubbed.|`|XaXvKZDfaa	Yarrrgh, here goes.    1 omg! This is the saddest Rin and Sesshomaru Fanfiction I've ever read in my entire life! I actually cried for a long time!!!  http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2576639/1/  I kinda stopped reading InuYasha fanfiction a while ago, but this story does seem interesting. When you described how sad it was I thought Rin died at the end or something like that.    2 would you rather spend the entire day watching your most hated anime show, or spending the entire day with your most hated anime character?  ==>>I would rather watch Bokura Tenshi Dokuro-chan than actually spend a day with her. At least I'm protected with a TV screen.    3 How often do you watch anime in one day?  ==>> It depends. If it's an online anime series then I normally watch as much as I feel like watching, because no one else normally uses the computer. If it's on a DVD then I normally wait until the big TV is free. If I really want to watch it and the TV isn't free I use the portable DVD player and headphones.    4 Your walking alone through the woods and you hear someone yell "Die *insert you name here*!" It turns out to be your fave character. How do you react  ==>> Sora? Oh, please, you expect to kill me with a KEY that only works on Heartless?    6 Fans of Vampire Knight and Vampire Knight Guilty; I am interested in watching the anime, but I can't find it in english, do you know any reliable sites?  ==>> There is no English dub because the anime has not been released in the U.S as of late (in fact, I'm not sure it's even licensed currently). I'm afraid you'll have to make due with English subtitles for now.    I'll just do the bonus questions too.    Olguine; Why does gaara where a turtle neck when he lives in the desert?  ==>> You are supposed to wear clothes that cover your body, especially in sensitive areas such as the neck, in the desert to keep from being seriously burned by the strong UV rays, which can also cause skin cancer.    Stephen; How do you feel when you see fan service? a couple of ladies taking a bath, or trying on clothing or boobie jokes?  ==>>I normally laugh at it, because, really, it's just a cartoon.    Lou Lou; I mean, plushie or any other anime object -- or something you wish you had (anime related) but dont!! XD    ==>>Currently? The adorable Hetalia Axis Powers Nendroid figures. Look, they're so cute!  http://akibahobby.net/2009/01/kotobukiya...    Black Winged Assasin; do you watch more than 5 anime series?  ==>>Of course!    Akuma, => Why was your friday awesome?  ==>>My English teacher doesn't believe in homework on Fridays so I have a COMPLETELY FREE WEEKEND!    My question:    Whats the weirdest anime you've ever watched?  ==>> Yakitate!! Japan, the anime about bread baking!|`|3N2ElzcQaa	My mouse pad won't let me tap on things on the screen anymore, so I have to use the left and right clickers. :/    1 omg! This is the saddest Rin and Sesshomaru Fanfiction I've ever read in my entire life! I actually cried for a long time!!!  http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2576639/1/    -aww, but cheer up because it ain't actually true    2 would you rather spend the entire day watching your most hated anime show, or spending the entire day with your most hated anime character?  ==>> I would rather spend it with my most hated character because, I guess being able to actually meet Kikyo would be a great honor since shes from my absolute fave anime, even if shes a *****, plus I would like to get to know her better since I dont really know why I hate her :P (plz, I dont want to start any arguments)    -spend the day with the most hated anime character    3 How often do you watch anime in one day?  ==>> For me it depends. Either I watch a couple episodes from random animes, dont watch anime at all, or if I found a new anime I like, I dont stop watching it unless I'm busy or if I finish it.    -it depends    4 Your walking alone through the woods and you hear someone yell "Die *insert you name here*!" It turns out to be your fave character. How do you react  ==>> Sesshomaru! NOOOO!!! Please let me live!!! And than I would go hug him and hope he will change his mind (at the same time enjoy being so close to him ;)    -I freak out and run home    5 Wanna ask something random?    -do you watch more than 5 anime series?    *~*~*~*~*~*BONUS*~*~*~*~*~*    6 Fans of Vampire Knight and Vampire Knight Guilty; I am interested in watching the anime, but I can't find it in english, do you know any reliable sites?    -there's no dubbed version yet. its subbed though|`|HRQjffv8aa	1 omg!

It turns out to be your fave character. How do you react  ==>> T.T sesshy will kill me? noooooooo ill hug him1 then he kills me o.o then he realizes he loves me then he revives me XD wheee!    5 Wanna ask something random?    => Why was your friday awesome?    *~*~*~*~*~*BONUS*~*~*~*~*~*    6 Fans of Vampire Knight and Vampire Knight Guilty; I am interested in watching the anime, but I can't find it in english, do you know any reliable sites?    => XD vampire knight is goooddd..o.o' there's a dub? nah there's no dub|`|8yE2sYGeaa	1. The problem with fanfic is if you do not know the show, the story is not as effective as it could be. I have written 27 Mahoromatic tales, but I hardly got any hits on them, as only those who like mahoromatic will read them    2. Watching, as I do not hate the show (fantastic Children), but it just isn't interesting    3.  It depends for me as well. I usually watch no more than two hours (as I have to be here doing things, right?)    4. I shrug my shoulders and accept my fate, knowing that it will be quick (Mahoro Ando using Shining Darkness on me. It's over like that)    5. FOR THE LADIES: How do you feel when you see fan service? a couple of ladies taking a bath, or trying on clothing or boobie jokes?|`|moJ5NnCMaa	1 omg!

Im not as involved as i thought...    2 would you rather spend the entire day watching your most hated anime show, or spending the entire day with your most hated anime character?  ==>>I hate kaname from vampire knight. I like Zero better = D  I'd rather watch the whole day cuz hes a vampire and he could kill me..    3 How often do you watch anime in one day?  ==>>If i really like it i'd keep watching until i basically finish the series   (I have no life) but sometimes i read so much i have nothing to read the next day or so (-_-)    4 Your walking alone through the woods and you hear someone yell "Die *insert you name here*!" It turns out to be your fave character. How do you react  ==>> crap. well most of my fav characters are REALLY skilled so im screwed...    5 Wanna ask something random?  Remember me?

ngeBdq3Maa	For some folks the color of love is      Red ... fiery and hot,      For others the color is      Blue ... placid and calm,      For some it's      Yellow... caring but cautious,      For others it's      Orange ... rich and fruitful,      For some the color is      Lavender... gentle and kind,      For others it's      Purple... sacrificing and giving,      For some it's      Green ... with its go, go, go,      For others the color is      White ... pure and undefiled.      But for me the color is      Rainbow ... Red and Blue,      Yellow and Orange,      Lavender and Purple,      Green and White.      The Rainbow painted by God      is a symbol of forever-love,      And as long as there is      sunshine and rain      there will always be Rainbows,      And as long as there are Rainbows      there will always be      forever-love for you.

YOU ARE NOT A STALKER...REALLY.|`|ZRbTdQ6iaa	why does everyone write so much :/|`|WggRi7MZaa	STALKER!    *makes Jaws sound*|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Dude do you know what a f*cking stalker is???  A stalker is when you follow somebody everywhere, in a sinister and secretive way, you don't leave them alone, you take pictures of them, and this person still has no idea. THATS WHAT A STALKER IS.    Now tell me, how the f*ck does what you said have ANYTHING to do with being stalker???|`|QcJOXHdvaa	no just tel them that you didnt mean to    and that your intentions were good|`|IHa6FxE6aa	Yes.|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	you don't sound like a stalker, no they won't apologize, so better move on and find new friends =(|`|RNBViGUjaa	wow thats allot to read.....so if u really had to ask that...i would say u r....so yeah|`|5Xg2TuQDaa	I think you're a drama queen...worry about the homeless,worry about the Iraqi/Afghanistan war....stop worrying about Yahoo Answers crap|`|hZmifSPMaa	sad..=(|`|v4MtQBReaa	That really does suck.  They are backstabbers, don't be friends with them.  They are probably boys and have shlongs anyway.|`|E9ZLxgsOaa	You mean like Jack and the Bean Stalk|`|yOsLz1iCaa	If those friends who believed her are gone then there not really friends. also if u hate her than why would u be stalking her.|`|XsbM1TcNaa	that depends.. do you think im a pedophile?  :D hahah kidding!  idk.. maybee :O|`|ENCAZO7Paa	Your story confused me.  =P    No, you aren't a stalk--- HEY!  ARE YOU THE ONE HIDING BEHIND MY BED?? GTFO STALKER!!!    :p|`|MklhprnLaa	Based on your story, you don't sound like a stalker.  But if you're so sure that you're not, then why are you asking?|`|EONhiOGaaa	thats not fair i belive you . you a not a stalker and friends like that are not spose to be your friend so go out and find better friends|`|P7pZo7Ztaa	No you are not a stalker you are just the victim of being in the wrong place and wrong situation at the wrong time. Just ignore those people accusing you of being a stalker, you know that your not and thats all that matters. And if you did lose 30 friends over it, then they mustn't have been good friends.|`|RDzfSweJaa	ur not a stalker but this girl needs to chill u are not a stalker and the f****** world doesnt revolve around her|`|8wXw5xhHaa	You are not a stalker, but your friends are way too high strung.  Dump them.  They won't apoolgize.  But why do you care?  Find new friends.|`|uUwjynYyaa	yep,  your probably in like grade 8 or something.   loser|`|mKULeVN4aa	hell no, the person who did just callled u 1 is retarded, lol. shes probs just jealous, tell ur friends u lost the story.|`|F4BIqnWoaa	No, you're not a stalker.  No, they won't apologize because they're obviously petty and childish.    You're better off.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	and why do you give a SHI%T what these little beeyotches say??    theyre being mean and trying to gang up on you, theyre probably just ugly and jealous because youre prettier and are trying  to ruin your self esteem. you are by no means a stalker, and next time they call you that, tell them to be a little more educated and look the definition up in the dictionary....  its not like youre creeping in the bushes or peeking thru their windows... its ONLINE for crying out loud. who cares who you added to your friend list, if they care so much about your friend list, then THEYRE the stalkers.  ignore them. in a few years ( i know this seems very important to you right now, but just wait) theyll realize what MORONS they are.
Sih0xHJgaa	I have a few band t-shirts and like one or so pairs of skinny jeans and coloured hair....but I mean I'm not a fake person. I wear what I wear because I like it. I wear what I can afford and what I like best. I don't wear prep clothes because that's just not me...if I went out and dressed all preppy or something than I would consider myself fake.|`|bvPO5lIBaa	wow u r soooooo IGNORANT!!!! you say ur not obsessed but obviously you are!! if you didnt care about the clothes then you wouldnt have posted anything. i just started wearing skinnies cuz they flatter my shape more. you seriosly have no life if you like to critisize what other people wear. i mean kid what r u like 12? you probably wear those things yourself, otherwise you wouldnt be worried about "fakes." no 1 is fake, they can wear whatever they want. why dont u get some real friends and quit worrying about what others wear.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	I think they're just expressing themselves. ;)    For people who are faking it, yeah, it's a phase....sooner or later they'll decide who they really are. xD    I don't see many people who dress like that in my school. I've only seen 2 emos and 2 scene kids...in a really big school.

waGFlfRUaa	Here is my top five:    1. One  2. And Justice For All  3. Blackened  4. Sad But True  5. Enter Sandman    I also like:   Master of Puppets  For Whom the Bell Tolls  Orion  Don't Tread on Me  Battery|`|vlIXsFmhaa	(sigh) edit    All of them. I cant choose favorites    Maybe Fade to Black, Blackened, Ride the Lightning, Welcome Home(Sanitarium), The Four Horsemen, Seek and Destroy, Leper Messiah (the list goes on)|`|CTQNPj56aa	every song from Ride the lightning and kill  'Em All|`|7e779664f2fa69c81d06551c999ec10baa	Sanitarium|`|pmrKsxHTaa	I absolutely LOVE  Seek and Destroy,  Minus Human, The Memory Remains, and Creeping Death.  HOnestly, I just LOVE Metallica|`|ty3nnq2uaa	Can you smell the Metal???  Master of Puppets  Suicide and Redemption  Turn the Page  Fade To Black  The Day That Never Comes  The Memory Remains  Sanitarium|`|vtJ7NqB6aa	The Day That Never Comes ~~|`|3vkdihJ6aa	i have to say the unforgivin it has a good beat to it and i also like orion its instrumental but realy good|`|XOaENPqZaa	Cant pick one song, so I'm gonna go for the entire Master of Puppets album.    Greatest metal record of the 20th Century.|`|AA11751910	Enter Sandman|`|s1ZxSkQiaa	Battery or Welcome Home (sanitarium).    Although it all is better than most new music|`|fpMYbn3Jaa	Of Wolf and Man. Enter Sandman.|`|3FOmoaUZaa	Fade to Black|`|jkRomxuPaa	ENTER SANDMAN!!!|`|7a68192d6e605ad9c0d1ad60daa6de4faa	die die die, my darlin|`|1Lry7esvaa	sad but true|`|yLUqNgqsaa	Either The days that never comes or Fade to Black|`|mj3LBE3laa	its really hard to choose cause theyre the greatest band in the world but hit the lights off kill 'em all is amazing|`|k5qq9h85aa	my favorites are..... one and death magnetic there both great!|`|13db234cf3863e51aea2abfa5343e6bfaa	battery from the s&m album|`|bhI5ACXLaa	i love all of them but Blackened is the one i would pick out of all of them
N05OZAQFaa	For rock i Suggest "Louis XIV"  For hip hop i suggest "Matisyahu"  -I more suggest the song "smash lies" by matisyahu  -& "Beggin" by Madcon  -"The Queen & I" by Gym Class Heroes  - "skin" by R.Kelly  -"New York ****" by busta Rhymes  -Lie by Nelly  -Good day by Nappy Roots  -Shoot me down by lil wayne  -Spaz by NERD  -Stripped by shiny toy guns  -Scotty doesnt know by lustra  -New born by Muse  -I also really enjoy the artist "Kerli Koiv"    but when it comes to music thats not so "Hard core" i enjoy  The Garden - Mirah  Consequence - the Notwist  Tatou - Brand New  To build a home - the cinematic orchestra  Opus 23 - Dustin O'halloran  L'origine nascosta - Ludovico Einaudi  Moonlight Sonata - Beethoven  Nocturne in C  minor - Frederic Chopin  Primavera - Ludovico Einaudi  Divenire - Ludovico Einaudi  Arabesque - Claude Debussy  Beau Soir - Claude Debussy  I caught myself - Paramore|`|vcWuPlOyaa	I love ACDC but its sort of up to this century and Fantasia.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	As far as I am concerned they quit writing rock and roll music after the mid nineties, all this rap and hip hop is just terrible.  Most all of the eighties and very early 90's bands are awesome, just google those terms.|`|AA11751910	"Re-Education Through Labor" by Rise Against is my favorite song at the moment.  A good solid rock song.|`|965b3cdf1baaaf0db1629ee04282ff34aa	90's smashing pumpkins  bjork  radiohead (especially music from the ok computer album)  placebo    80's   duran duran  eurythmics  david bowie  madonna      honestly i could just go on|`|NnppIfq4aa	I love 80's thrash metal.  Bands like: Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Iron Maiden(even though they aren't a thrash metal band, lol).|`|hOIWPsoxaa	Everything. Music is only relative to how we were raised and our lifestyle. There are many influential benefactors to why we 'like' what we do, saying it as if it is almost a conscious choice.    I say don't hold back. Consume as much as possible!|`|HGQWFDw1aa	Ok for 80's  B-50 2's   Blondie  Madonna   Prince  Stray Cats  Southern Culture On The Skits  Tommy Tutone    OK for just overall music  Paramore  Katy Perry    Stay away from RAP! Rap means: Retards Attempting Poetry with and idiotic beat.   :)|`|b2d6b3ca07b8bc41fdb72c1b50f347cdaa	Bad Religion  Black Label Society  Corrosion of Conformity  Danzig  Kasey Chambers  Kyuss  Public Enemy  Rush  Seether  Social Distortion  Suicidal Tendencies  Tiger Army

Because others pale in comparison to it. It's labeled as a hentai, though it really focuses on the girl's relationships. I just can't see it as a hentai though. It has more plot and drama than some non-hentai!    www.mangatraders.com  www.mangafox.com  Good sites to get it. First one is a download site though.    If you go to www.mangaupdates.com, and click on the GENRES tab, you can do a genre search for yuri titles. And if you head into the forums and ask, there are plenty of people who will give you specific yuri titles, like if you want an incest theme or a focus on girlfriends.    I heard of another one called Hanjuku Joshi. Sounded like it was okay.    Good luck!

FZKFLTyLaa	Because he has poor social graces. I'd politely bash him in the class in order to halt this.. something along the lines of "just what gives you the right to discuss my conversations openly in this class, and how are they relevant?"  If that does no good, I might see to it that he can't overhear, and might even resort to whispering while pointing at him.

Then I'd smack my face down on the pillow again and fall asleep.|`|dduWesM5aa	probably pick you up while you were asleep take you outside, put you on the floor then walk back in and lock the door.          CALI FTW.|`|Nngdk0izaa	Most likely think that magic does exist and ask you if you either a) broke into my house or b) did a spell that teleported you to some random place, that ended up being here. Or, I could do option 2 which would be to whack you with my book and see if it affects you or slips right through you. Weird question. :) I'm not THAT mean and tempted to kick you off. That would be totally rude...|`|re06t6zvaa	scream! that would be freaky random.|`|8a3822ced036f956bfbf2ffe198d7003aa	I'd wonder how you  A) found my house  B) found my room  C) managed to get in without waking me up  and why you would do that...you're a creeper CCB...|`|yqgkAYu6aa	"OMG! What in the world happen last night? My mom's gonna kill me, if she found out I slept with you!"|`|ko3J5akPaa	I'd be confused as to what happened lol and just stay there thinking trying to remember.|`|whV7euJLaa	hide under the covers thn scream that your not wearing uderwear and run out and not relaise my door is close and go BANG into the door.  :)  most likely.|`|AA11457957	Get out and dial 911|`|tyqN6qBUaa	If you're not hot, and you didn't just pass out because of drinking or other drugs, I'd kick you out, but be nice about it. But, I sleep with my fiance, so I don't think I'd like you sleeping in "our" bed.|`|AA11367901	I jump up and ask you if you had forgot where your bed is.|`|v5E29qDxaa	I would scream and say, "Get out of here, freak!!!"|`|osF09hCvaa	first, i would question your sexuality.  then, i would probably start a nice convo with you =]  haha|`|647d90c817d50303cceb01679642cbd4aa	well if thats you on your avatar, i would stare at you all night.|`|Q8etYn60aa	I'd be pretty freaked out and probably scream since there would be a young girl next to me instead of my husband!|`|i615KZMDaa	make you smell my hot breath then realize you look sexy. make you strip and play yu gi oh cards ;D|`|5btOe5t4aa	um.. i would probably be like "wtf ur hogging my pillow and blanket!!!"|`|dnr56kb6aa	probably screamm and start kicking  then run out of the room, not looking were i was going and most likly run into something|`|5db181f9ef16abe283773b859f06d725aa	ask you how old you are, then take it from there...|`|LEyAM6Auaa	Steal the covers and go back to sleep . . .

PY36EofEaa	Merle Haggard - Wake Up
1H7MoHLtaa	I think the fact that Heroes is on G4 the following day will mean 24 will dominate the ratings between them.  Most people who want to watch both will either DVR it or just watch it the next day.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	I'll be watching Heroes - gave up on 24 a few years ago.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	I watch 24 on Monday night then Heroes the next day.|`|NaRTybOYaa	I really enjoy both shoes, but I will watch heroes and dvr 24.|`|djHlBmH3aa	24 of course.

BswVoF8Paa	i thought i was the only one!    One time i drank 3 glasses before bed, got up, went to the bathrrom, peed a lot, and dazed off. TRUE STORY!|`|ef831d986a5932fbeb4aaba747db2c77aa	Never really thought about it that way.|`|NC9FV8bLaa	Just happened to me yesterday.|`|k1Lx7tqCaa	hahahahaha|`|FliUPdJOaa	no, never tried, i'l try right now|`|KaVjLUwmaa	haha. not exactly that but i did think something like "wow why am i peeing for so long? i think it has already been a minute!" haha|`|AA12016383	yea a few times|`|NmVqS2Biaa	OMG yes!!!! hahahahaha|`|WW5Xp6ofaa	Haha lol yeah,  I hate when that happens on school mornings  because I lose like 3 minutes of time I could have been getting ready.  Lol ^_^|`|CPZA5qrGaa	I do everyday, frequently. Don't you?  At least you're sitting/squatting.  Try peeing standing up like us fellas do.  I even go   2, when I must. Don't you?  While going   2,... Don't you hate it when   it just hangs there and won't drop?|`|9iIPjUG2aa	YESSS, esp. when i have the cold, my mom makes me drink tons of water so i can pee the bacteria out. last time i stayed on the toilet for too long and the pee just kept coming, i THOUGHT i finished and when the toilet paper is just about to hit, i realized i was still peeing LOL.|`|FGZR9RwDaa	hahaha yes!|`|7f2GSDmqaa	yes I have....the never ending piss|`|767fd71f931856f7e4e2fe8bf027c74caa	Oh my god, yesssssss.|`|AdEJBAkMaa	Yeah LOL :P

"I'M BILLY MAYS, AND YOU SHOULD BUY MY NEW RECYCLED DOG CRAP! THIS WAY YOUR DOG COULD TAKE THE SAME $HIT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, AND YOU ONLY HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP ONE TIME, BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME PIECE OF CRAP!!"    Does that even make sense??

FZKFLTyLaa	Far more than I thought!  Here's a list, with a new one due out soon :    http://www.lifehousemusic.com/discograph...
uhvKLEgGaa	1. Don't let your friends ask a guy if they like you, guy may just deny it.    2. He may want to ask you out but is afraid of rejection.    3.You should ask him out even if he says no, cus guys like it when girls ask them out.    4.Don't wait until the dance to see if he'll ask you out cus you may lose him to another girl.    5. It does sounds like he likes you. There's only one way to find out tho.     6. If you don't have the guts to ask him out, give him signals to let him know you're interested, such as smiles etc.. or you can talk to him more often so he can get comfortable with you and then if he ask you out it won't be so ackward.    GOODLUCK|`|u1DTjrgPaa	adsfasdf|`|lrrrStfCaa	Your 2 young 2 be dating|`|dYd7yRBVaa	Ask him straight up, if he says no, big deal. It's not the end of the world.|`|QUoMxIIpaa	yes they both like you|`|JvyfKTJYaa	I think he's just shy. Wait for him to make a move when there's not a lot of people around, he'll be less intimidated then. Luke could be lying, or he could be lying to Luke. Usually most guys aren't that open about that kind of stuff, especially to their guy friends.|`|Afx0GVtVaa	is his name Edward?|`|BvA2NmiGaa	although i`m not sure, i think he`s interested..  & i wouldn`t listen to anything your friend luke says if HE likes you too... from past experiences, people like that will lie to their benefit ...|`|f7IQEXlqaa	Well, if your friend Luke askedhim this, and he replied with a no, then he was probably just embarressed. If he's always looking at you, and trying to be your partner, then he definetly likes you =]|`|b079baa83e4c1f0d6b0ad310ad2327c4aa	From what youre saying, it doesn't seem like you've ever had a conversation with him yourself. You may find that he will like you better once you start talking. If you wanted a reliable source to find out if he likes you, let it be you!  guys love the confidence!    GOOD LUCK!|`|gZ02RMjhaa	your answer is simple. BOYS ARE STUPID lol    (contradicting, because i am a boy) hahah    he likes you. it might be that luke is jealous. or maybe he didnt want to tell luke becuase he didnt want people to know    you should wait around so he can make a move. but some boys are shy if god hasnt given them the gift of serious game:] hahah    you should try flirting. or staring him down, in a cute way, so you can get the message across that you like him too:]    GOOOD LUCKKK!|`|FnrcC4h4aa	Well....I'm a guy and it's pretty obveous if another guy has to turn around to look at you then yes he obveosly likes u!!!!|`|0i0InSFJaa	He does like you. He is just shy. Why not go and speak with him. There is no reason for you to be shy. Find a reason or ask a friend to go and chat with him and then call you over. Or, get his e-mail from a friend and contact him online.   :-)  All the best|`|3TdT5mG2aa	Ask him. Simple.|`|XXbINMWzaa	Just ask him if he wants to help you with your homework or something like that.  Get to know him a little.  Then you can ask him if he is interested.|`|up363TZyaa	i wish i had a boyfriend.    sorry, that doesn't really answer the question, though, does it?  whatever.|`|QEqGukjZaa	mixed signals never good..he is not interested.|`|XhpLwjCuaa	Honestly, if he is eyeing you he thinks your attractive and guys who like you will lie to you, ask him out its not the guys job to do it, if you get rejected (which I doubt you will) then move on your only in hish school thats a lot of live you still need to experience|`|yWrwDSDLaa	Oh! I almost have the same problem! Except he doesn't really look at me too much anymore.    I think he is. Hey, there is only one way to find out: Ask him!  If you aren't too close with him, just ask him. If he is closer to you, find one o your other friends and ask them to ask him.     If you want, you could wait it out. But that has not been too successful with it. Then again, I'm a tad overweight, not too attractive, and my crush has a girlfriend. xD    I'm not sure. Guys are strange like that.|`|nXUV9lH1aa	ohgod move on.|`|AA12383908	Short and to the point... you will always have boy/man problems.|`|WggRi7MZaa	He likes you.|`|cYFAo75Yaa	please stop the madness...just ask him and don't bug us with this trivial jr high non sense|`|MQCT1FXjaa	i think luke was lying,    just ask your boy is he does or doesnt :]|`|zRmwEFAwaa	Ok, lets just say both of them like you. Even if the 1st guy might not like you, pretend he does. Ask the 1st guy to the dance and if he says yes, then, yay for you, but if he doesn't accept, you have Luke. OK?|`|Afzknn9Laa	First off, I wouldn't trust your friend Luke if he has feelings for you because he's just going to lie to get his way. And honestly, I stare around a lot and when I do, people always think I'm looking at them but really I'm not. For example, I was staring at this giant poster in our hallway and my ex was standing right in front of it. Then my friend asked if I was staring at him and I didn't even notice he was there until she actually said it. So you can't really tell if they are looking right at you. But if he was, maybe he's just shy because he doesn't really know you or talk to you. Just give it a while and see what happens.|`|ve0sWDThaa	WELL FiRST OF ALL! DONT SiT AROUND AND SECOND GUESS iF HE LiKES U OR NOT,JUSS BE EAZY BREEZY..YA DigG??|`|OxaonF5aaa	Don;t believe in any one else, give some time and you will get the right solutions|`|PTGHq3avaa	Take this over to Singles & Dating. I know that you posted it in P&S because there are lots of people here, but the people in S&D are helpful in that area and will be willing to read your enitre question.|`|vO6aU7qVaa	hes shy...make a move|`|wAaBOnYXaa	you sholud make a move|`|nmRANtmhaa	Could be he lied to Luke because boys don't really tell their friends that.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	Your teachers get you from lunch?    Who cares...you sound too young to have a boyfriend anyway. I doubt you'll last even if you do hook up.|`|gew4KVFfaa	i think he likes u=) the friends of the guys u like will almost NEVER tell u the truth cuz they like to mess with u. and if luke likes u.. then u know for sure hes just saying that cuz he wants u to like him back.   so dont worry and i hope everything works out for you=)|`|AA10458689	Oh hell yeah he is into you. He thinks he is playing it cool but, you've got him. If he's not going to ask you out then you may have to make the first move...........believe me. Guys love that.|`|IlSd37mOaa	The same thing happened to me, like exact same story. And my "that guy" is now my boyfriend.    I think that Luke lied to you. If Luke likes you he sure as hell wasn't gonna ask "that guy" if he likes you.    The guy seems really into you. You should go for it girl!|`|2XTkSV4daa	haha i like you!! "just like every other teenage girl in america there's this guy" that's funny. yes, i think he likes you and i would wait for the dance, if he hasn't said anything by then, don't worry about him. if you like him, i would talk to him more and kind of subtly let him know.    btw, what about this luke guy? maybe you should give him a chance|`|rRO3x9hZaa	He might like you, and he might be afraid that you don't like him. And I guess it is likely that your friend Luke lied about him not liking you.   I guess if I were in your shoes, I'd just wait and see. If he really likes you, he'll make a move. Make sure you are approachable and friendly towards him in the meantime.|`|93yb4QaHaa	His friend will never tell you that he likes you, because that guy likes you too and wants your attention to be on him not his friend. So it sounds like you have to guys fighting over you, watch out cuz things could get messy between them!|`|uHTpBjWDaa	I happen to be a guy, and I think if you really like him you should make a move because I actually like it when girls do that kind of thing and it would make life a lot easier.  There are plenty of girls I have liked but not asked out, and I'm sure he has a few too.  Get a different answer than Luke from one of his friends, then make a move.|`|yWFsab6laa	umm ive had so much drama and confussion in my life that i dont think i have the right to answer this question. (but if i did, i would say that he probably does like you) but as ive said before i dont think i have the right to answer this question. so my lips are sealed.|`|6PVFDHnzaa	interesting problem,   yea i'd say he likes you. :)  I'd also say he is shy. And age does play some part in this but you didn't say.  I think he would be interested in going to the dance with you since he keeps looking at you. But i think you might have to do the asking or throw some hint that you might like him to. Do you talk to him at all? If he did tell luke that he doesn't like you then he's just majorly shy because a guy doesn't keep looking at a girl unless he likes her. But it sounds like luke just made that up since you said that luke also likes you.     hope you enjoy the dance. :)

Long story....  When I was in middle school, we got this new principal and she made up these things called super parties, and she would make all of the students go outside of the school and put like one or two teachers out there to watch us. These parties were supposed to be like rewards, but they were really stupid because they didn't give us anything to do. They just made us stand outside.   So this one time during one of the parties I called my mom on my cell phone and I was like "The principal kicked us out of the building again! Come pick me up!"    So my mom came and drove around the back of the school and I sneaked passed the two teachers and left.  It was fun.      End of long story....|`|79c8ae67c46c5115144cf09d72566a64aa	Yeah lots of times, one time in school there was an assembly a few of us went out the backdoor of the building while everyone was in the gym.

8yE2sYGeaa	Ninja Nonsense  Tide-Line Blue  Jubei-chan|`|dsTVW1WTaa	Definatly-    Death Note [If you havent already seen it.]  Light Yagami is an extremely intelligent young man who resents the crime and corruption in the world. His life undergoes a drastic change when he discovers a mysterious notebook, known as the "Death Note", lying on the ground. The Death Note's instructions claim that if a human's name is written within it, that person shall die. Light is initially skeptical of the notebook's authenticity, but after experimenting with it, Light realizes that the Death Note is real. After meeting with the previous owner of the Death Note, a shinigami named Ryuk, Light seeks to become "the God of the New World" by passing his keen judgment on those he deems to be evil or who get in his way. A shinigami's Death Note is a notebook that can kill any human whose name is written in it. All Death Notes are governed by the same set of rules determining the extents and limitations of the Notes' powers.  Soon, the number of inexplicable deaths of reported criminals catches the attention of the International Police Organization and a mysterious detective known only as "L". L quickly learns that the serial killer, dubbed by the public as "Kira" (?, derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the word "killer"), is located in Japan. L also concludes that Kira can kill people without laying a finger on them. Light realizes that L will be his greatest nemesis, and a game of psychological cat and mouse between the two begins.    It may sound childish at glance, but this is REALLY a great anime.      Code Geass  On August 10, 2010, a.t.b., the Holy Empire of Britannia overpowered Japanese forces and conquered the country with their new, powerful, robotic weapons, the Knightmare Frames, in less than a month. In the aftermath of Britannia's invasion, Japan lost its freedom, its rights, and even its name, becoming Area 11 of the Britannian Empire. The Japanese people, renamed as "Elevens", are forced to survive in poor neighborhoods, while Britannians live in first-class settlements. Rebel elements persist, however, as pockets of Japanese organizations struggle against the Empire for the independence of Japan.    After his father, the Emperor of Britannia, failed to prevent the assassination of his mother, an attack which also left his sister blind and crippled, the young prince Lelouch vowed to destroy Britannia. Seven years later, he accidentally becomes mixed up with "terrorists" in Area 11 and encounters a mysterious girl named C.C., who gives him the power of Geass. With it, he finally has the power that he needs to defeat Britannia and fulfill his two wishes: to seek revenge for his mother and to construct a world in which his beloved sister Nunnally can live happily.    Its kinda actiony- But its VERY intense and makes you think.|`|Tp2JTBJVaa	Ouran High School Host Club and Special A.

tbQX8bRGaa	yes its possible    PROOF  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWwlNhgN1...|`|AeixtHvcaa	OMG people!  It is possable to snezze with your eyes open, and no they won't pop out that's part of it just some dumb made up myth to scare people to not snezze with your eyes open, And just because soem people back then couldn't sneeze with they're eyes open doesn't mean that the whole world can't.|`|zwjWRZRraa	yes i tried it once and it worked|`|SqGlfuiRaa	It is completely possible to do so and no damage will come to your eyes in the process.       The muscles, and bones of your eye sockets will hold your eyes in place.       It is nearly impossible to simply force your eyelids open using only the muscles of the eyelids themselves. This is because of the natural reflex that is involved with sneezing. You can use your fingers or other object to force them open though.|`|IXDiEX8eaa	Yes you can but your eyes will water terribly.|`|zBRaqw21aa	Yes it is.    No they won't.|`|WKdhUG1gaa	naa they wont i have before|`|yC5wufu9aa	I think they will pop out. But that would cool.|`|NLwfMSJWaa	they did it on mythbusters  your eyes wont pop out..|`|AA12081834	i wouldn't try it....they'll pop out.|`|EE9F6q3Jaa	no, it's just impossible.  duh|`|UtRuxx7aaa	I sneeze with one eye open.|`|hOIWPsoxaa	I did it today infront of the mirror. Nothing happened.|`|AA10950898	I  believe  the answer is no.|`|oP0lL85Baa	*ahh my eyes!*    (i just tried it. i cant see what im typing any longer.)|`|qS4EG5qYaa	no its impossible
2k8TEiRtaa	Noooo, don't tell me that. I can't believe it. Not that!!!!|`|Azj1nMZVaa	robot chicken is retarted
hxPAIlGUaa	Yep...and they become asinine little idiots who answer questions on Y!A in "text talk"!!!|`|bpyx92GZaa	no, babies are born innocent and it depends on how they are raised. There are awesome parents out there and not so cool mean parents out there.....|`|xpiGWrdMaa	For the most part, yes. But there are some who were mistreated as children and harbor deep seeded hate because of it and they turn evil.|`|IYNDaQ2taa	No|`|2liwk8yKaa	There is good and ban in everyone, sometimes the bad just comes out first.|`|9IvcV7tiaa	yes, i think so. there's a big difference in being "bad" and being evil. evil comes from within, i don't think it's learned. it's a part of who that person is.|`|a8UX1tHLaa	Everyone has good and evil inside them. I read an American Indian tale that said that each person has two wolves inside them. One represents evil, hatred, lies, ect. The other represents love, joy, compassion, kindness, etc. The one that wins is the one that you choose to feed. If you fill your heart with hatred towards other people, lie, and such things, then the evil 'wolf' will win. If you fill it with kindness, love, and joy, the good 'wolf' will win. So, even people like Adolf Hitler weren't born evil. They were born with a choice. And we see what choice he made.|`|QEqGukjZaa	we all have that in us..evil and good is in everyone.    its just up to us what we choose    its already there before were born..|`|MHoTbF2laa	There's two types of evil people    People who were born evil   &&  People who were born nice and became evil|`|3dLcWuvsaa	no|`|Orx9cTJJaa	I would like to think I got it from my dad's side.    Btw - I love your picture, you're beautiful.|`|n4ITRmykaa	Nope..this is something that is learned|`|yB3Jek85aa	no i dont believe in being evil now excuse me i have to finish up hacking my mom UP into small pieces|`|BBVfRheyaa	nope.|`|xLO5VRYTaa	I think maybe Dr Evil was|`|aPaPlEiCaa	no they became that way|`|AA10409668	We all have some evil in us.  -----------------|`|AA12383908	No They get that way later in life.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	no.?|`|62Dk8fJDaa	No.... I think we are all born clean slates....    Our environment determines our outcome....    Just my thoughts.....|`|jiOohUa0aa	No, it's more to do with how they're brought up and things that happen to them throughout their lives which affect the way they perceive and interact with the world.|`|PlVh12fpaa	yes!|`|t5SPwLZeaa	Yah. They could prolly talk when they were babies and do evil stuff an ordinary baby wouldn't do to pass suspicion and i got an excellent example - My cousin . . I wont say the name - i will get in trouble!!|`|AIJgbvIcaa	Yeah. I agree with Hobbs Philosophy.     for example... leave a child alone with no love or affection it will grow up with more anger and issues then a child with love and affection. There is however the exception of mental illnesses.|`|7y7t04Vsaa	I think you are born not with evil but with a tendency or a predisposition to be more evil than other people. But some people can overcome this while others cannot.    I know personality is born into you because I am like my father but I never knew him at all. I did not try to be like him because I was not aware of what he was like until I was older. By then I was already very similar in personality to how he was and I was always wondering where did my weird brain come from. Now I know. HAHA!|`|WWCfdgd0aa	no, they become evil|`|i3S10DUqaa	No, we weren't.  We were born nice, loving children, but we were ignored by our parents and society, so we had to do something about it... ^.^|`|vXOreO4Uaa	Nope.  It all depends how it was their childhood.  For example if when you were small and you saw your mom   kill people all the time then you grow up with that example  and you start killing people.  For example too if your dad all he does is give love and care  for his family then that's what your going to do.|`|WgIZUcYfaa	No. Most people are a product of their environment. There are the lucky few who don't end up like their parents.|`|lILfQh6xaa	Yes i do. Its just as life goes on, they hone their skill.|`|NLsaNo6taa	yup|`|ko3J5akPaa	nope|`|GItb4cxmaa	Nope.|`|rUFBXL3Uaa	No|`|O8XRgMu4aa	no.... people are born innocent and are corrupted over time|`|JHfxwDsqaa	no. they learn to be evil from their evil parents|`|6Zmy02HFaa	nope, they just dont know how to spell,like you|`|l3ukjXK0aa	lol peopole :P      that is a possibility|`|8UBYsoBEaa	i suppose so|`|FliUPdJOaa	nah probably not, maybe they got influenced to be evil|`|PTGHq3avaa	No.|`|vdcUYLztaa	Not really?|`|x7iYis9Saa	Maybe u should take a long hard look at yourself, and ask that one more time.    Jk|`|GYi7V2Jsaa	No, just lead in the wrong direction|`|CxyXgoA5aa	No.|`|OxaonF5aaa	No, that is not posble|`|Amf1wtJmaa	Not exactly.  We're all born into an evil world - but some people are easier turned to the evil then others.|`|S2tBYhCKaa	No.  Based on previous paid employment history at facility formerly titled:  State Hospital for the Criminal Insane.|`|B5KR2Yjlaa	Yeah it starts coming out little by little|`|fJPc6Iayaa	I think evil people were born with less inhibitions about doing bad things than "normal" people.|`|qHDkCC2Caa	no, i think there lack of education does it to them. Some people were brought up bad by their parents, and that makes them not know what to do when they grow up and since they dont see themselves doing well they have no excuse not to be evil, so they are. I also think lack of God in a person's life makes them a little mroe evil. These are the people we need to pray for.|`|dE5m2Krmaa	YES. We are all born with a nature and it does NOT CHANGE.|`|pUArocI5aa	Yes, I was born evil. Thanks for asking. ^-^|`|PgoT3gIeaa	No, I think it was the ppl who are around them that influence them to be the way they are. Unfortunately, I deal with these people everyday and it gets really frustrating. :\|`|37X9zjS4aa	no well thats what i think|`|4a4fc6fd359a16c13169b1185d22b8b7aa	nope, it develops|`|dLoIRwH6aa	I think some have Medical reasons to be evil, They don't possess the ability for empathy as that part of their Brain didn't develop properly|`|TxvWkK1Zaa	Nah, they just got corrupted somewhere along the way.|`|0U29DjU7aa	Everyone is born innocent with absolutely no opinion but as we grown up and experience what we experience we make choices and form opinions... some good and some bad. Also making some people good or bad.|`|TIH01UJoaa	BAHAHA!!    I'm watching Sponge bob and it said EVVIIILLL right as I saw this question.      Weird.  O.o    Uhm no.

AA10262086	That song is ''Smokin' Gun'' by ''Robert Cray''. It's Off the ''Strong Persuader'' album.  If your not familiar with Robert Cray he's a very talented blues guitar player and singer. This particular song was a good hit for him and a launching pad of sorts for his contemporary blues popularity. I must say that hearing it done bluegrass style was kinda cool though. Del Mcroury is known for that , i've heard him do Van Halen and even Jimi Hendrix licks before in bluegrass songs. If you wanna hear true bluegrass music then just listen to any song by Bill Monroe. He was the true godfather of bluegrass. Just about any music download site should have Smokin' gun available. Or just look for the Strong Persuader CD.|`|pTfQbaxcaa	It's called Smoking Gun - It's a Robert Cray tune    http://www.twin-music.com/azlyrics/c_fil... has the lyrics and it's available as an MP3 from the typical sites.

One time it said   You will do something you have never done before in your life. May make you a bit nervous but just go for it.    And i kissed someone for the first time.    another.  Today is a time of need. Something happened and you need some help. Stretch to family and friends to help you out.    My boyfriend broke up with me.    another  everyone will look up to you today. be ready to answer questions and lead the way.    I got partnered up with a group that only looks for me for answers.     Today's horoscope  Coming up with great ideas will be your forte today. You'll generate good solutions.    We were creating ideas for a campaign and i came up with the top 5 ideas|`|SqGlfuiRaa	yes, like today my horoscope is: You have an urge to be of service to someone today. It's a sign you are growing. Today i was helping out my friend with this guy she likes and i learned alot today. lol|`|xXMLwwyraa	I don't know, I don't read them.|`|JQbSakITaa	I would really love to read it and would believe it and i'll make the best of it.
TtxFdO5paa	I would go with classical music. It gives a fight scene such a surreal atmosphere.      or the greatest battle by Totally Radd, but that one has lyrics.
EWE5BMLKaa	The Stones.    The Beatles actually did something instead of creating the same album over and over for the entire span of their career.|`|XOaENPqZaa	Beatles.|`|N05OZAQFaa	I absolutley love the beatles!!    ...  so ill have to say the stones are overated|`|72e863b263ebd4485bd6d41d9ef138caaa	stones|`|SRvJfYlOaa	beatles|`|lGzQtEH7aa	The Beatles- they're not that great.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	The Beatles.    The Stones are made of awesome and win up to a point. Personally I think they're by far the better Band of the two.    Anybody that thinks The Stones did the same Album over and over is dumb as hell and doesn't know enough about music to fill a thimble.|`|EzqfAUFuaa	i hate the term overrated. it's so overrated.    i always use the beatles and the stones as comparison for any band. like if the band is more focused on high quality production and intricate songwriting techniques, they're like the beatles. but if they're more into just jamming and really getting some good energy flowing, they're like the stones. personally i prefer bands like the stones, but they each have their merits and i really couldn't call either overrated.|`|UAHjJpC0aa	neither    the Beatles are the best Pop Band    the Stones are the best Rock Band|`|oOSNI3wbaa	the beatles.|`|waGFlfRUaa	Nirvana & Pearl Jam... These two bands suck!!!|`|vlIXsFmhaa	Neither..... Disturbed and Nickelback fit|`|AA11751910	Stones.  Both are great though.|`|qAfnWKQCaa	The Beatles|`|mg3EaEHMaa	the beatles were innovative and able to stay fresh and marketable through changing time periods. they brought diversity to the table.    the stones however are probably most popular due to the length of the duration of their career more than anything. don't get me wrong, the stones are great, but they follow a very redundant formula.    stones are overrated, but they deserve it.|`|fpMYbn3Jaa	Beatles. Both are still awesome for their time period though. I agree with whoever said Nickelback and Disturbed. They both suck.|`|2WBs0QiXaa	The beatlles  did something alot of bands just can't do, and that's make every song different. The stones, I dunno there both unique in a way. They. Both have great music who cares if there overrated.|`|361c70be0209ad9c5ef2d3e4577f11e5aa	The Beatles & Stones are NOT overrated in any way, shape or form.
laUWZapIaa	Sweetie, you have to understand a couple of things about people and being on line. 1. is, not everyone are on the same level, you have grown adults, young adults and children. So, yes there are gonna be some foolish answers just like there will be foolish questions. Some people are really serious about their questions and some are just playing with people. And You are right sometimes the same question may be asked more than once due to the fact the person did not see it was already asked. I feel the bottom line is, this ask and answer page is like a game, that's why you get points and levels. While at the same time it serves a purpose. So for the ones that are really asking real questions while having fun playing this game and meeting people, Have fun...Enjoy yourself...And for the ones who are just here to play and say respectful comments, Ignore them, they are still probably in a growing stage, Everyone just need to remember for all the ones who give foolish answers, you will meet the one who is just as serious as you. Use this as a learning tool for how you do and do not want to be in life. Don't let nobody steal your joy! And, you will be alright sweetie.|`|k6uSRCNbaa	Uh, usually that means if the person would have searched the question first they would have found the answer quicker, instead of asking a whole new question about it.|`|f57HWgj3aa	yes|`|roUanZs4aa	most people only answer search bar when its a question a million other people have asked (ie: whats nick jonas's real cell number? isn't twilight the best movie ever made? etc...)
Z5mmaFK0aa	FIRST    Out of the Silent Planet   Gretchen Goes to Nebraska  Faith Hope Love   King's X   Dogman   Ear Candy      those are my favorite albums. Yes they are extremely underrated. They have their own exclusive style of Progressive Metal combining Soul, Groove, Blues all kinds of elements to their music.     Doug Pinnick is such an amazing song writer as well. All the members are very talented. Dream Theater has often praised their work in public interviews and conversations. In Fact they had Doug as a guest on their song Lines In The Sand.     I love the band myself yeah they are Amazing|`|l7fiAHRLaa	I have to check them out I guess, never heard of them...

I went to bed and didn't say anything I just left!  I hope this doesn't impact our Y!A relationship.    Note:  I'm probably older than you and going to bed at 10 on a Friday doesn't even phase me anymore.|`|ICLekd2Vaa	nope, you just need a good man between, um i dont wanna get violated for it. but it starts with l and the rest sounds like eggs!! ;)|`|P8uh4joQaa	I must be old then too. I used to be such a little party animal and now I work 7 days a week and go home and just get in bed, snuggle up and go to sleep.

PMQWI1Ojaa	I try but it freezes all the time and I get terribly frustrated.  Sometimes I forget I have it too.

It is fun ... and very cool to actually get to hear everyone, but it seemed to die rather quickly. I still check in once in awhile though.     Maybe it'll pick back up as summer comes around and life slows down a bit.     Peace ?    Uh, ma answered well except for the revenge comment! lol I mean I wouldn't mind if he talked dirty to me either ... but I don't want to speak for everyone on that topic!  ;-)|`|DzIlM76Xaa	I'm with revenge. Just imagine the movie Fargo and when you read my posts. Or should I say my "pohhhsts".|`|AA11514493	Sigh  I have it.  Seemed like I was the only one using it..and to be honest, with a few exceptions, I wasn't sure if anyone was even listening.  so when I started feeling crappy again.. I let it slide.  But I got a big smile earlier when I signed on tonight...

I don't know why I would use it because half the time I don't even answer my phone here at home so why add that?|`|2089c2125bd52f479e8785a63e67137daa	not me|`|ICLekd2Vaa	not me, sorry babe :(|`|VSRyCQyVaa	I've actually got an account, but I"ve been too lazy to use it!

zflFYeyjaa	No. I can't actually think of many other bands who have such a broad appeal across demographics; go to a concert of The Killers and while the venue is comprised of many male and female in their 20s, there are young teenagers and even 40/50year-olds - because of their diverse sound and their influences.|`|vO6aU7qVaa	no just a crappy one|`|L1FqPE3Vaa	I like them, but I don't even like lots of rock bands...so they're good.|`|uQdurp7iaa	Even thought the lyrics to some of their songs would suggest so, I wouldn't agree with that.|`|vzfj3Bgraa	No|`|rCnRgUiIaa	I'm a dude and i love the killers.

Too many to mention.  Some of them were sort of one-hit wonders. Some of them, the members just couldn't get along.  Other ones have suffered deaths of members.  Some of them have wanted to go into their own directions with their music so the band split up.  Others have had addiction issues.      I am also a fan of bands that haven't broken up but don't produce any music or do any tours...  How frustrating is that?

One time a drug addict jumped on my friend's car window trying to sell his fake gold necklace, for money, for drugs. When she said no, he started banging on the window and swearing and all that.

fcEqR3yFaa	Both methods are used, but seldom in the same flick.  For instance, the movie 'Mama Mia' utilizes songs done by Abba that are over twenty-five years old, and 'Grease 2' had the songs written after the script, with a little tweaking afterward.  There is no set format.  Just like different novelists use different methods for their product.|`|mr7AIkuKaa	songs first..  before the script for the movie..
xTMnDTzfaa	I don't give a d*mn  :-)    I have a life, and things that are infinitely more important to care about. ex: my wonderful friends, my wonderful mother, my many and enjoyable extracurriculars, getting good grades to get into a good college, enjoying each and every day too much to care about what other people (who aren't my friends and family) think about me.|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	Glad to see you..=]  I've been good.!      Popularity isn't important to me, I chill with my true friends,and surround myself with weirdos,geeks,and funny people like myself. I have a good amount of friends,I don't need alot.hehe. I mostly focus on receiving "A" grades and that's basically it. Though my magnetic personality attracts alot of people in school which turns into alot of "hi's and bye's" from aquatints (if i spelled it right)and random people. lol.! I can live without being popular.! =]|`|LAGM6I2vaa	I don't really care what other people think about me.I am popular in my own little group and that's all that really matters.What matters is what my true friends think not,what people that hate my because I don't like to wear anything but jeans and t-shirts think.I couldn't care less about what they have to say.|`|uV3LLJn8aa	no, i would rather be unpopular,... being popular puts way too much pressure on you and you feel like you need to be perfect all the time... i need some breathing room.|`|v62MVbHHaa	Well depends on your definition of popular. Popular as in one of the"popular" kids? thats not important to me. Popular as in having lots of friends, i guess. I have tons of friends.

Okay, nevermind, I'm leaving...hee hee.|`|7hrOjPwjaa	The best thing about a bloody hot day is going to the bottle shop for supplies. Especially if they have a walk-in fridge. Go in there and shut the door and take aaaaaaaages to decide which type of beverage you're going to get.  Failing that, go and do some shopping at a large shopping centre. They usually have air conditioning.  Failing that, go to the movies. They always have air conditioning.    What would i be doing on a day like that?   Most likely i'd be working in the bloody sun and not having the option of doing the things i mentioned previously.    Stay hydrated. Beer = good.|`|UoDtGtiLaa	outside|`|iLQojxY1aa	yea well it's about midnite here in eastern canada and it's negative a lot of degrees outside....XD|`|UwFb8cleaa	who would want to live in australia anyway, its in the middle of nowhere, no road goes there, and its hot as shiet|`|NrbLdZzOaa	You have NO idea how jealous I am of you!

You may not tape conversations since that likely violates wiretap laws.    She already stepped over the line in the interview so a lot depends on her intent.  She could have been joking and simply likes you; she could be lonely and want some company on the weekend or she may want you to put out as a condition of keeping your job.    Then the ball's in your court, and it depends on what you want.  You can put out if you like what you see and are willing.  You could politely decline.  "You're very attractive and I'm enjoying the evening, but that's a bit too fast for me."  Thus stringing her along of course, and that only works for so long before she gets frustrated.    If you decline, the ball's in her court and she can either appreciate you for your talents (don't hold your breath) or retaliate against you.  This is why you want to keep a diary of all interactions with her.  Depending on her response and how it affects your employment, you can then seek legal advice.  Claim you didn't know she was expecting sex and it absolutely shocked you.  Your lawyer will know better, and he'll advise you on how to present yourself to a jury.    If she wants sex as a condition of getting or keeping a job, this is a windfall I wouldn't ignore.  It could be a great financial opportunity.  Don't waste sympathy; it's no more correct for a middle-aged woman boss to exploit a younger man than for a middle-aged male boss to try exploiting a younger woman.  I heard of someone who got caught up in such a situation; it wasn't even mentioned in the job interview but when he didn't put out he was fired.  That was his big payday since he won the case.    My advice?  Other than the diary, start looking around for your next job.  Unless she's that hot and you want to play it that way.|`|xoVA08Zaaa	Haha nice avatar.  Good luck with old lady wrinkles...j/k|`|k1Lx7tqCaa	hahaah um no shes probably lonleyy but i use my looks all the time|`|pOLBKKNpaa	agree to have a drink but at a public place like a restaurant    if she just wants to get to know the "real you" that will be perfectly acceptable without being at her house|`|GGo5j2b1aa	Lol whoa.

Can't blame someone for having what it takes.|`|aPxmZq00aa	Sounds pretty forward to me especially at the interview. It could turn out to be a pretty sticky situation if it turns out she wants you and you have other interests or don't feel the same way. You should never agreed to her requirements when you got the job. Good luck.

Being the President of  US is not a real job for all, it is a selected one by 0.3bn people & by God, therefore is just for the selected group that stand for election and not a job for anyone......so is very very impossible.  But impossible can be possible and that is B H Obama.  He wants it in the very beginning, but the Black American in America will never realise it until it happened.  They have waited in despaired all these years for the 1st Black President in USA.....and at last they got it.

9wUrbqT3aa	I dont think 50 went to far,,, due to Rick Ross aka Officer Ricky commenting on 50 baby mama in the diss ryhme.    Rick can't repsond... cuz everything 50 is doing is facts.  Ross is a liar.. he lied about being a C.O., he  lied about his Money (he can't even afford child support or get a lawyer to squash teh case), so... all he can do now is look to rebuild his career some other way.      Ross isn't capable of an "Ether" type track or a "300 bars by Game" type track...    Chalk this one up as number four for 50 cent..... Ja, Camron, Fat Joe, & Rick Ross|`|kuxVB76maa	50 Cent will win. He's from New York, has more muscle and has a killer flow.|`|bBHlGs5waa	No.|`|VBFwT9nVaa	One thing I don't get is how ppl make such a big deal of Ross being a C.O, it's not like half the rappers rap what they live. But one thing's for sure, Rick Ross has some hot tracks that are perfect for speedin' down the freeway and bangin the **** outta your stereo for. Curtis is good with ending careers, I don't know about this, but 50 cent has much more money than Ross.|`|hA5m65Waaa	I think Ricky is kinda shook.  He went on the radio earlier today and dismissed the song as "garbage".  The track 50 dropped yesterday sounds like he's just toyin with Ross|`|F1SjcigGaa	i really dont like either one but    50>Officer Ross|`|2UT79f9Jaa	Look what 50 did to Ja Rule i mean he's not in the game anymore|`|yvJRtMFmaa	ok 50 cent is the man.. hes not gunna end his career . hes on top of hip hop right now . theres no way hes gunna stop .. he didnt stop after he lost to kanye in record sales .. nd hes not stopping now .. plus even if he did all his classic albums destroy anyhting rick ross ever made . I personally am not a fan of rick ross.|`|B0LEWK0baa	50 Is Crazy Overrated. Not A Great Rapper. Lol|`|ILIuId0Haa	This gots to be the stupidest rivalry in a minute. Ones a cop and the other hang with cops. Snitch vs Snitch|`|YAJvT2hlaa	an officer and snitch, i would think they would be best friend, but 50 cent crossed the line bringing in the baby mama's into this

LoXvNBEmaa	a deviated septum is when a person's septum (the dividing cartilage between the nostrils) is not lying in the center of the nose. instead it is to either side. the deviated septum is usually caused to a large impact to the face, breaking the cartilage. it is operated on to straighten the piece of cartilage, because it can make someone not breathe correctly. it usually doesn't make your nose smaller...just corrects the deviated septum.|`|f4ehvRQlaa	i think i have this condition. but its ok though.  :)|`|Iek7D2hOaa	i think it's just a deformity of the septum which creates a crooked bend in the nose.  i'm pretty sure owen wilson has it.|`|EE1f7yNmaa	this should explain it   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviated_se...|`|PkfyKybtaa	It is most frequently caused by impact trauma, such as by a blow to the face. It can also be a congenital disorder, caused by compression of the nose during childbirth.      septoplasty, is a treatment for it quick treatment but recovery takes about a month

0GTKBM4Zaa	no not at all! because cops aren't telling you not to smoke they are telling you it's bad for you..i think health teahcers that smoke set a bad example because it makes them out to be a hipicrit..  good luck in the police academy!  |`|vdcUYLztaa	You don't wanna look like that douchebag cop smoking in public and have kids see you.|`|RROm6cqnaa	No it sets the right example. that they're all morons|`|TF2Rx5HYaa	think of all the fat a*ss donut eating cops...

I honestly think if you are meant to see this girl again you will. Use the law of attraction.. think positively about it everday. Don't say "I don't want to miss out on that.. I'm so bummed." Like attracts like. Think: "I want to see this girl again. I will talk to her."  Couldn't hurt right?    Go back to target often.  A job there, perhaps.|`|vjPMIkg3aa	post your missed encounter on Craig's list, chances are she noticed u standing there smoking.  maybe if u describe her well enough someone who looks at Craig's list will recognize and bring it to her attention.
eokH64z0aa	I have to admit I prefer the blonde, but the platinum blonde.

Just like the guys who adore Blondes.         Sometimes a hair cut or style can bring out a girl's features more and can strike you guys as "stunning".          BTW, you are a nice guy!          =)|`|ibhJgDmUaa	No offence to any blondes, but most Brunette girls are usually quite different from one another in some way. But I see a lot of Blondes who are just like, your typical hot blonde girl. Y know? That's my opinion. Though I probably sound like I'm just being totally biased. Lol

AA11849917	In some cultures, and this is for real, not just hypothetical, but in some cultures, if the leader of a tribes wanted to make peace with their enemy, he would send his oldest son to live with the other tribe, their enemy.  It was called the "peace child."    In another culture (yes, this, too, is for real), if someone has been murdered, the guilty party would either face death, or must literally take the place of the murdered one and fulfill the destiny of the other person.    With these two concepts in mind, I would become a member of the tribe and replace the son by fulfilling the father's destiny for his son, and obeying the father as the son had been doing/would continue to do.  But I would not become a cannibal in the process.    Now, if you were guilty of some crime (such as high treason), worthy of death, and the judge - for some unaccountable reason - wanted to grant you a pardon, but couldn't because of the stringent requirements of the law, if he, personally, took off his royal judge's robes, came down, and sat down in the electric chair in YOUR place, thus satisfying both public justice (the death penalty) and private justice (the judge could grant you that pardon), would you go on in your life of rebellion and treason, or would you, seeing the judge's self-sacrifice, adjust your life to live up to the judge's expectations of you?  (Oh, did I happen to mention that the judge is your father?)    The first two examples, being real situations, were used to bring the gospel of God's love, giving His only Son, to some tribes, and the entire tribe became Christians on the spot, when they understood what God had done for them.  Jesus was God's "Peace Child", given to die for us.  (The book I got this information from is called "Eternity In Their Hearts")|`|9nymzoOXaa	3.    ignore the man, kill myself, then let them do whatever they want to my body.|`|mD4Xn3jNaa	49101)Kill all that wanted to boil me, then I would boil them and serve them to the whale at Sea World|`|yWFsab6laa	3 first of all idk what i did to get myself into that situation, but im trying to start becoming a better person unlike i have been since like a month ago so to tell the truth i guess i would stay, and just hope that my  life has been good enough to send me to a better place....although....nevermind too much detail...........|`|9b5935684568a7cb72fa426091885e25aa	1a id do that and go on with life knowing full well i owe him id treat him with alot of respect and tell him again and again that he saved my life and that i owe him big tym for ever and spend the rest of life loving them|`|MHoTbF2laa	2  I would sleep with all of them

I rarely eat crisps/chips but the amount of flavors they have is amazing.|`|BWmSvTZ0aa	I can't think of any right now. I'm happy with the crisp flavours we have.|`|ffe5fd93595474e278dc16274aa2a2d4aa	Chicken Ceaser flavour.    and if it could have zero calories and fat it would be even better.
SYUWOlzraa	I've been in that same situation before... You could rent a funny movie, or take her shopping, or play DDR (works every time).|`|UnbudISCaa	You could bake some chocolate chip cookies together or make some snacks and good food to munch on, watch some movies, play video games,  look at family pictures, listen to music, go roller skating, go for a bike ride, or go swimming.|`|zBRaqw21aa	Throw her out the window and tell her to get lost.|`|FCFQRAvCaa	Watch a DVD and/or do your nails.

7qt4aQGYaa	fiddle with the tone of your amp, that might help    but you will need a delay pedal to play it correctly, that'll give that spacey tone, like your playing in a cave (at least that's what it sounds like to me)
rRCTvT7Saa	1.  For all the artists with talent, it'll actually be played live.    2.  If artists are faking it, they'll have a prerecorded track to play.    3.  Practice does make perfect.      Also, at awards shows, I've read that it's not unusual for backing tracks to be prerecorded and played back while the singer is singing and, if they play guitar, they'll sometimes play guitar live and just sing with the backing track playing.  Who said that?  Well, it was country star Brad Paisley, and it can be found in the March 2009 issue of Guitar Player Magazine.  Keep in mind that awards shows do that to save time by not having to set up the drums, bass, keyboards, etc.  Brad Paisley even admitted to having to do that once or twice on awards shows and that he would never do that again.|`|ifB3p0pGaa	you were watching the jonas brothers?!?!?!?!?!??!????!!!???!?!?!??!?...    its all real except with pousers like the jonas brothers|`|J7oQV0zPaa	You've made the fatal mistake of using the Jonas Brothers in your example,   i can see you getting some flak for that!        (I told you so!)|`|zTEvTWXCaa	guitar plaing is usually real unless they are shitheads like the jonas brothers or lil wayne|`|j10VTUkCaa	i guess it kind of depends on the band that's playing.  the jonas brothers. well. they're... them. they're so hugely popular that I wouldn't be surprised if the guitar playing WAS fake in concert - that's not to say they don't actually play outside of concerts. Because, lip-syncing is common with big stars, so who's to say that the guitar playing ISN'T being faked and we're hearing a recording?  It's completely plausible.    Now. Other bands that aren't as well known, they're au naturale haha. Those indie bands which I adore so much, their playing is real in concerts. They have to do that in order to get big - people would lose respect for them otherwise.    But yeah, backflip + running + loads of distortion probably ='s fake playing.|`|9fe1aed97d908635d9aa305b9f986ae8aa	probably not for them. i've never really seen anyone bust a solo and run around. you know they're not faking it. a lot of times too, one of two guitars is louder. so maybe backflip dude was the guy who is muffled slightly by other guitar player|`|rkkIyPoQaa	On live recordings, a lot of the time the bands go into the studio to fix mistakes they made live. I'm completely against this...    Some people may fake it, but not usually.    Practice surely helps.    A lot of guitarists, especially the famous ones with loads of money have rigs which have different noise reducers and compressors in them to help rid of excess noise.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	Jonas Brothers  There's your answer.    I'm sure they can play the guitar, but I doubt they do it live, at least not by themselves.|`|JyxNA1o0aa	Well not the jonas brothers! come on now...    But uh listen LISTEN to Metallica back in the day or Zeppelin or Iron Maiden or AC/DC or VAN HALEN and that'll answer your question.|`|zZPbmxWkaa	It is real, but the Jonass Sisters are about as fake as you can get. They don't play real instruments.|`|l7fiAHRLaa	Wouldn't be surprised if it was fake but why were you watching the Jonas Brothers?|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	My cat plays better guitar than the Jonas Brothers.  Go see Clapton, Townshend or Page, they don't need to fake it!

Like Katt Williams said if you have 10 haters you should be working on how to get four more. Not an exact quote but you get it. If they took the time out of their day just to be rude to you than you must be important. That's how I look at it anyway. Anytime one of my Q or A's get reported it just reinforces that.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	about 10 minutes after starting using it    i also realized i have no life what so ever|`|vxQEqHvzaa	The first day I was here.

AA11875616	I can't put a finger on what is so appealing about him, but maybe it's his eyes.  Maybe it's that innocent grin.  Maybe it's just a rare, happenstance combination of unique genes.  I really don't know...|`|KJLb8Hb5aa	No way he is SO damn hot in that movie :P  when he was walking down the road snipping all his clothing off i was all like `` i wish he would take my clothes off like that`` he also looks hawt in Pirates of the caribbean haha love love love him in Edward Scissor hands thO *HAHAHA DROOL XD|`|I1K6SC43aa	No. But then again, I think characters like Frank N Furter from Rocky Horror look appealing =P.|`|1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	Yes, even with the hands and the white makeup, he was still appealing|`|qYm40x0yaa	LOVE that movie|`|jvevMDFeaa	johnny depp is amazing in anything.. he could put a bag over his head and still look sexy.. have to say though secret window was his sexiest.. i have a thing for crazy guys :P|`|ZnXk0nlYaa	yes :)  that movie used to scare me haha
BrHcx9jraa	"Illusions, Michael, illuuuusions. Tricks are something whores do for money...... or candy"    "I'm afraid I've just blue myself"    "You know what you do? You get a tape recorder and just record yourself for a whole day. I think you'd be surprised at some of your phrasing."    I can't wait either. But apparently Michael Cera might not do it. He's too busy reenacting his favorite star wars scenes.|`|OXleDYVQaa	I really have no clue what yer talkin about, but I felt so uplifted when my teachers invited me up on stage to award me a special ribbon for finally getting out of 8th grade after 3 attempts.

D9D8Ezybaa	she doesnt say what she knows she should and u dont understand what she wasnt u to without her saying it and she doesnt think your telling the truth but today you told the truth    maybe idk|`|kB7pHahLaa	It seems like she wants attention.    TRANSLATION    "something i should say"  eather i love you or i want someone else    "it takes you everyday"  your never around anymore    "what you give is not alive"  i dont think you mean what you say    "today"  a new day    "your soul served on a plate"  you took your soul out and gave it to me, i love you    "throw it away"  you took it all back/take it back, i dont care      I hope I helped you! I hope you and girlfriend work things out. :)|`|69e079e9f485b346bcd651b8aa99e4b7aa	Well if i had to guess... I'd say she feels like you're not giving your all to the relationship..or what you're giving isn't real or genuine.     Then again, these lyrics may not refer to you.. But if they do, i bet that's it.|`|GtXZHvhVaa	she says she loves you   but you reject it  ?????????????|`|mp1MfFMraa	It means that she is unhappy in the relationship and you need to make her feel better about things.|`|oDbcaGj4aa	the song couldn't be about anything other than a broken relationship trying to be brought back together. That could mean two people, or one person and perhaps drugs -- I lean more towards two people. The "fire" being felt "around us" represents the tension between the two when they are back around each other. After an intense fued between two people, when brought back together there is definitely a feeling of "fire" and intensity -- because the past is difficult to get around -- therefore every moment together feels unatural and anxious.|`|vkETbqRmaa	its sounds like things arent exactly resolved to me. shes probably gonna dump you

We would have regular jobs, bakers, construction workers, day care all these jobs but with no pay, instead all the products we make are given away. Like a community thing, or even a global thing. There would be no more races; no more blacks, no more whites, no more Asian's, instead there would only be human beings.     there is an ENDLESS list of things why this is world impossible.

hJP9y6kjaa	Pillar.... I know I've heard them before, but I can't actually remember what they sounded like... they must be horribly generic?    Not Papa Roach. Infest was good, but everything after that has sucked pretty hard.    Yeah, it's definitely between Three Days Grace and Breaking Benjamin.    Hmmm. It's hard. Neither is truly great. I've heard Three Days Grace's earlier album, and it's completely different... but I've only heard Breaking Benjamin's earlier album, the one with "Cold" on it.    I guess Three Days Grace. I like more of their songs, Breaking Benjamin's songs don't really stand out as much to me - I've heard that album and I don't really remember it....        Saul|`|9n2RLRZDaa	Well I would have to say Papa Roach. I'm their biggest fan. Not only does the music rock, but they are one of the best bands I've seen in concert. I do however like Three Days Grace and Breaking Benjamin alot, but still PAPA ROACH is my pick. Can't wait until March 24th for the new album|`|lBZkXzr0aa	tie between Papa Roach and Breaking Benjamin.

Hey, you can't have children with animals. You need a  man/woman.

You have to tell me your age though so i can adjust my discussion to be appropriate if you're a minor.

AA11894640	I hear cats have more lives than anyone!      But then who/what will balance the cats???    With all that caterwauling,  Universe will keel right over....|`|xoVA08Zaaa	Nasty|`|k49jRjUeaa	no|`|953ee5f029c35236fa7fe7beb0e468e4aa	We animal designers are working on a new and improved cat, a cross with the hardiest insects of our planet. We call her the "Becquerel Kitty", and she will indeed be there to eat the roaches when mankind has long kicked the radioactive bucket.  So, take heart.  It's all going well.|`|DfBH8Dr9aa	Kittens will survive because the scientist will make little protective space suits for them to wear.|`|wDJRyzE9aa	Feelin kind of intense huh?
AA12390047	I agree.  I don't think Jimmy is funny and I rarely see Carson Daly.  BUt Conan was an unknown when he took over  for Letterman at 12:30 NBC so maybe Jimmy will get some new writers and get better.

s8cB5BPLaa	i say you should pick guitar.    its funner too..    and you can learn how to play "kids" by MGMT|`|mj3LBE3laa	most people play electric but base can be really cool like in metallica or the thing for seinfield|`|jGgOVd5Zaa	It depends a lot on what part of the music you like.  Very few bass players get to solo, but bands are always looking for bassists.  The frets are a little farther apart on a bass, so if you have smaller hands it can be tough.  I think the bass is a little harder on the finger tips too.  I have a friend who plays bass.  He uses nylon coated strings so that they don't chew up his fingers so bad.  Bass strings and bass amps are also more expensive than guitar strings.  I've only fooled around on either one though.  (I have the beginnings of carpal tunnel syndrome so I took up the harmonica instead.)|`|8BG2tqTGaa	i suggest bass guitar first, its easier and can also sound alot nicer! i would g onto electric after you've learnt a bit!|`|UAHjJpC0aa	I will always say to start on guitar first  (it teaches you chord structure)    then you can switch to bass anytime you want,  when you learn to listen to the drummer    every GOOD bass player I know,   plays guitar too|`|ZbEF9KoXaa	well i play guitar so i'm partial to that. and bass players don't get that much credit. if you want the spotlight go for electric guitar.
ErN3pbTeaa	Scorpios, Sagittarius, and Aquarius      I'm a Taurus, and I only social binge drink. I prefer sweet things over alcohol.    I'd say Pisces and Cancer too, but only when they are drowning in their emotions.    Edit: Actually all of the signs can get hooked on something like alcohol. The reasons are most likely different though.|`|xUxUwloPaa	Meh. It could be anybody....PUT THE DRINK DOWN, ARIES! ;-P|`|xzahKZdzaa	gemini and piesces    ~~~|`|XrO99oydaa	from what i've seen and experienced cancer, taurus, and libra|`|e0e2a1e555e25acd8b2434029f363560aa	Lol. A Sagittarius like myself :]|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	Sagittarius are the most drunk people I know. hehehe They like to party.|`|AA10532675	Cancer. Poor little me.  And they blame their problems on everybody else.|`|qUFwZUzdaa	pisces    We tend to drink & smoke pot when we cant cure are problems.|`|TSioWojHaa	1. Pisces ...    2. Scorpion ...      Bes sure they are a good drunker ;)|`|fbzvTxDwaa	Scorpion I am a scorpion too.|`|mD7eAAoNaa	Pisces, I say so only because I read that they are prone to becoming alcoholics.    But based off of people I know, I'd say Taurus and Cancer, since they are very self-indulgent.     O and college kids in general.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Sag?|`|QelWHSZRaa	Darn it hon...you could have asked "what sign is never sober : LOL "    ...us aquarius love a little beer on the side and um, B.B.Q. and stuff|`|o2FJIXS9aa	I'm a Pisces and I like to drink. So do all the other ones I know. I know wild partiers of every sign, but Pisces and Sagittarius really do take the cake when it comes to drinking.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Aquarius and Sagittarius
QzokuJVsaa	I think it all really depends on the stage someone is in. Being single and meeting people is great, and I believe that everyone should have the chance to experience it before getting hitched. You learn a lot about yourself, what you like or don't like in a partner, and are able to try new things, live anywhere you want, because you don't have to consult any of your life decisions with a partner! It's a great time to develop your independence, identity, and sense of self.    On the other hand, if you're ready for a committed relationship, it's not a bad thing, either -- just be sure you are a whole person when you get in it, you're ready to give, compromise and understand an individual who's a whole lot different from yourself.    If you want more answers, I think youll probably be able to find the answer to your dilemma at Lisa Dailys site, http://www.datingexpert.tv   (Plus, theres a lot of good info there.) Shes the author of two dating books, HOW TO DATE LIKE A GROWN-UP and STOP GETTING DUMPED. Its one of my favorite sites for dating tips and advice, and the videos are pretty funny.    Im pretty sure she answers questions that are sent to her, you might try her for an answer to your question.|`|43hIPc94aa	it depends - at the moment i am happily committed in a year and a half relationship - but if i was single i would do the dating game.its a great way to meet new people and see what they are like  and you can back out at any time! you can also it as slow as you like  i would say there are advantages to both|`|cixmpRqmaa	I would suggest taking some time to let your heart heal. Dating can suck but sometimes that is when you find your true soulmate.      Meow.  Kat  www.katscollection.com  "Jewelry with a Heart!"
XTExSyv5aa	Yes, I was talking to some guy from a fuel company about propane prices.

Otherwise, I sound like a 10 year old boy.|`|n8BALQRiaa	a few times|`|gVYfFSpRaa	No, I wish.  I've always been jealous of girls that have slightly raspy voices (raspy in a good way).  My voice is okay.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	Not that I can recall.|`|6MCrTTRTaa	yes i have  haha and i have been complimented on my numorous laughs    thats all the details i have...lolz|`|lIQhB56Oaa	yeah.  i felt weird.  so I started talking in a nasal voice.
ZyGyDLsDaa	Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star (2003)  starring David Spade, Mary McCormack, Craig Bierko, Jenna Boyd, Alyssa Milano, Emmanuel Lewis, Leif Garrett  IMDb synopsis:  TV child star of the '70s, Dickie Roberts is now 35 and parking cars. Craving to regain the spotlight, he auditions for a role of a normal guy, but the director quickly sees he is anything but normal. Desperate to win the part, Dickie hires a family to help him replay his childhood and assume the identity of an average, everyday kid. Several folk who are also involved in Dickie's special world include: Sidney, Dickie's longtime friend and agent; Cyndi, his on-again, off-again girlfriend; Peggy, Dickie's real mother; George, Dickie's adopted father figure; and Grace, his adopted mother figure.

The answer is NO, it does not make a 'sound'.    Why?  Because when the tree falls... Yes, it does let the air vibrate, but if there is no ear present, these frequencies do not generate a 'sound'.    There is more to that than meets the ear; Briefly, the world of nature has many spectrum/frequencies humming all around, though our senses only capture certain wavelengths, the rest, are not intended for us humans.|`|B4UG9xDnaa	Probably not|`|SdCqy38haa	Probably the Billy Goats Gruff because they wouldn't have to worry about crossing the bridge anymore.

Im not diggin the BAAAP though. not my thing|`|NXSwMfyeaa	when I burp I say "That wasn't me...", so then the people around me are so focused on how stupid that sounds, so they forget about the burp.|`|ZkpqXIaaaa	GOOD ONE!!! I say excuse me. We made up this rule where if your mouth is open, you must say excuse me but if your mouth is closed when you burp, you don't have to. However, sometimes I have burped so loud but with my mouth closed & my friend would say "Gah ha hod!!!" So in those moments I do say excuse me. I guess the volume of the burp determines it for me. Ha ha ha!!!

ho6LQF8xaa	Last weekend, I was crying so hard because my mom keeps joking around about leaving my dad and going back to her old boyfriend..  She knows that I don't like those kind of jokes because I was neglected when I was little since they have to work plus sis has to go school so my grandma took care of me ever since and yet she still does it.    And my dad doesn't understand how I felt about not hanging w/my friends who I really want to hang out but couldn't since my big sister's friend long time ago sneak in cigarettes in my sis's bag but luckily they caught on tape and ever since that time my parents hasn't trust people that much. Mom even said I trust people easily! That hurt alot and I think it's true...|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	When my father passed away.|`|BrHcx9jraa	Today - I can sorta cry on command (i say sorta cause when i think about crying my eyes start to water up)|`|thQMTq1raa	my teacher yelled at me bcz i said that i didnt have gum in my mouth and then she checked and all i smelled wuz her stinky breath|`|qHDkCC2Caa	i cried tuesday watching the biggest loser|`|1ez9lleXaa	Two Mondays ago I watched Bride Wars.

And I burst into tears and locked myself in my room for an hour and chewed gum.       That sounds SO stupid now that I'm reading it. It was a lot worse than it sounds.|`|aMBAb7lyaa	Last friday, I was home alone, and I just felt really lonely..Honestly I've never felt that way before, and I just couldn't help it ..|`|ZzIpgngjaa	i was crying last night. i got a new 5th teacher. my life sucks. i want to commit suicide. i cant have a nice day. i probly never will again.|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	Today.

Ptct4Kheaa	I could not believe that ignorant jerk!  How can you claim to be a "citizen of the world" and be so hateful towards people different than you and stereotype people in the manner that he did?  I think he is still upset about us kicking their tea drinking butts in the American Revolution and then ravaging their queen.  Is that how everyone on the West Coast thinks about Midwesterners?|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Most brits are.

LoL|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	I was just watching it and the guy is a complete asshole who needs to get his *** out of america. The lady wasnt mean to him at all, it pissed me off when she asked him if he would ever bring the kids back to the go-carts and he called her a red neck. Thats not the kind of rolemodel any child should look up to and follow. The guy is just a plain jackass|`|Gqr63jT5aa	I know I was watching that and that guy was such a jerk and the most ignorant person I've seen in a long time. He needed to be slapped.|`|iaLVRwBnaa	for someone who thought he was all high and mighty because he is so well "educated", he sure did act like an immature hypocritical jerk. when the lady asked him to shut up when she was reading her rules he looked at his kids and said, "i know, this lady is so rude, but don't blame her she's not educated." rude? he was the rudest person i think i've ever seen on this show. "i make more money in a week than you do in a year". seriously?     this guy was absolutely painful to watch. he can hoot and toot all he wants about his great education, but obviously that great education hasn't helped him with his sheer ignorance. i would be embarassed if i were him. he sat there the whole show stereotyping people in the midwest. though i'm not from the midwest and have never visited, it was disgusting how he tried to stereotype that whole section of the nation for being fat, lazy, poor and stupid.     and how dare you try to stereotype people in a part of a country that you're NOT even from?!? honestly, the whole time i was just wondering who the hell does this guy think he is?|`|657a8f0dfc3ef29c4d187beb204f9292aa	I felt so sorry for that guys kids. what a total jerkface.

This anime is very much a classic and very popular in Europe, U.S and Japan. Its a great love story also, though it contains more of that love aspect in the manga. Even though its not too much physical love, the manga really expresses the strong romantic bond, which I personally like better. Its not just like other anime with characters fawning over other characters deemed to be good looking, even though the relationship is highly unrealistic even for t.v.      2 One Piece - Best Adventue Anime. Due to it's horrible dub, it's no where near as popular with western audience, as it is wth Japanese. It's one of the best selling and most successful titles in Japan. It's a great high seas adventure, great bottles of fun, AND it has very emotional and inspiring moments. As in, it has made me cry ill admit. You really get attached to ALL the main characters, and they have very developed pasts.    3 Cowboy Bebop - Best Western Anime- And by many, it is considered the best anime ever made. However, I already knew who died at the end, and it was spoiled. I don't know how much that altered my experience, but it's still great.     4 Neon Genesis Evangelion -Best Post Apocalyptic Psychological Anime- Extremely popular in Japan. This anime isn't my personal favorite, but it's still a dang masterpiece. Ill say one thing, if this anime doesn't screw your mind over and make you feel like crap, then I don't know what will. I personally don't go for anime like this, but it was interesting to see how all the main characters were mentally sick and how it ended was very uncommon for any series...Very un-cliche.    5) Death Note -Best Mystery Anime-  Pure awesome and the only series ive seen with a villanous main character.  Interesting to see how he goes from a top notched bored high school student, to a raving lunatic murderer who thinks he's a god.  This is a must watch anime.      5) Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann - Great mecha anime and very epic adventure.|`|F60JZOU3aa	try death note |`|dsTVW1WTaa	All of these if you LIKED bleach and FMA-  Code Geass  Code Geass R2  Death Note    And the classic-  Naruto Shipuuden.

Thick crepes, like Norwegian pancakes.  Stir up the eggs, mix in flour until it gets really thick, then stir in milk (gradually) until it thins out again.  It has to be thin enough to ladle in, slide around in the pan and cover the entire pan bottom.  Flip, finish the other side (you'll get the hang of it), fold in quarters and put on a platter until ready to serve.  No, they don't rise.  Perfect for spreading out and rolling up anything from jelly to stew in.  Really good.  Norwegian pancakes are a basic food and trust me, you will impress just about everyone.

Rvd6WNHaaa	Hey i saw your other question that was "why so many questions" or something like that, and since it got deleted or something, I would like you to read this......Hey I know how you feel. I believe in Jesus Christ, with all my heart too. But sometimes I just think I am not saved, and my sins are too bad to enter the kingdom of Heaven, or for God to love me. In fact, I'm struggling with it right now. Sometimes I cry out at night, and can't sleep because it bothers me so much. But I found some verses that are really awesome. John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave His only begotten son; that whoever BELIEVES in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. Here are some more for you to read: John 1:12, John 3:36, 1John 5:13, John 5:24, and Romans 5:8. This is how you KNOW you are saved. Ask yourself these questions: ("yes" to all these answers means you are saved) Do I know I am a sinner? Do I know that Jesus is the only way to heaven? Do you believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, and rose on the third day, so you could live with Him forever? Did you confess with your Mouth that Jesus died for you? if you answered yes to all of those questions, then my dear, you are saved, and you can look forward to heaven, and Jesus! Don't be afraid. I am a lot. But you can't trust your "feelings" because they deceive you. And so does Satan. When you doubt, always look back to those questions, and verses. They help :) OH! I just asked my dad about this really cool verse! It's in Romans.. Romans 10:9....If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved......There you go! I hope I helped you out. You are never alone on doubting your faith. Never alone on thinking you aren't saved. Satan puts those thoughts into your mind constantly, saying that your sins are too big for God to forgive, and that you are the only one who struggles with these doubts. That is a lie from the pit of hell, so don't believe it. Just keep reading your bible :) I really suggest that you read John! (in the bible) It's an awesome book on faith! And read Romans too. I'm reading Romans right now! Fantastic book so far. But your not alone. Jesus is with you, my sister in Jesus!|`|a4LWildhaa	Well, you can look at it like this-he hasn't done anything to "change" anything yet.  Now we know he had the Chicago political machine behind him.

McCain supporter|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	No, I'm not. I do not agree with sending our hard earned money to fund abortion because people do not take on responsiblity. That is murder. Just go to the abortion web pages and see for yourself what happens to those innocent little babies. And I do not agree with closing down Gitmo. That is a slap in the face to the American men and women that are fighting, or have fought and lost their lives to put those criminals there. The only thing he has accomplished is being the first black president. And know that I didn't vote for him.|`|5xaEC0EVaa	Why are you proud of him?  America is the "land of the free and the home of the brave" because many Americana's before him made America strong. Emphasize the word STRONG. They didn't apologize for fighting to get a seat at the table and then working their way to the head. The liberal bias that Americans need to apologize to the rest of the world for being strong is what is making us weak. And don't think the rest won't capitalize on us when we're down. They certainly won't help us like EVERY time we helped them for their turmoils.

When they were six years old, their pro-wrestling loving fathers introduced them to each other. Assuming that she was the best in wrestling, young Hikari challenged Kei to a wrestling match only to be thoroughly defeated by him. Ever since that fateful incident, Hikari swore to beat Kei in school grades, sporting events - anything. To do this, she has enrolled in the same school as Kei since elementary. Now she attends Hakusenkan, an ultra elite school, that costs her carpenter father a lot of money. Hikari and Kei are the top two students in the school, with Kei holding firmly to that number one position. While Hikari considers Kei to be a rival and important friend, she is completely unaware that Kei loves her. The story primarily focuses on Hikari and her constant attempts to defeat her one and only rival, Kei, and how she finds love in their rivalry|`|bmnINfECaa	BLEACH BLEACH BLEACH BLEACH is in the lead now|`|e8o2eP6Zaa	Bleach- Shounen    Awesome!!!|`|00065523689897d7479d3d1a6c534b20aa	Rurouni Kenshin!

PRCfCSDxaa	Classic rock in my opinion, is the best type of rock out there. Back then, lyrics actually meant something from the musician and the music was just so pure. I mean, you can't find anything like the good stuff nowadays. People would chose a bunch of gibberish in microphone (AKA Rap) over music like Led Zeppelin or Iron Maiden. Just because of that, I have so much more appreciation towards classic rock and metal (Like Metallica). It was real, pure talent. I can't get enough of it!|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	Because they can never get old.|`|rfwbZ2AXaa	Because the people tend to be actually playing the instruments, singing without the aid of a computer, and it has a great sound|`|ifB3p0pGaa	because it classicly rocks    EDIT.

I like Chuck Berry, John Lee Hooker, Jerry lee Lewis, The Kinks, the Ramones, MC5, AC/DC, The Stooges, ect... I dont know which of those bands most people consider classic rock.    I hate progressive and psychedelic rock (except SOME Hendrix), which is what I think most people think of as classic rock.|`|j6IjkPPVaa	Well 'cause it's the best music ever made duh.|`|Ju1skLb8aa	its what real music is, rap and pop aren't music in my opinion.|`|UEzTKxwYaa	Its pure, unlike most music today...|`|Oq8G5Cvlaa	Its longer than 2:30 min. and it told a story or how people feel!|`|9fe1aed97d908635d9aa305b9f986ae8aa	they weren't so much around as to make money, as they were to REALLY make music. having a good time...and i'm sure the drug use aided in the creativity...in a good way.|`|rkkIyPoQaa	I like different bands within the classic rock genre for different reasons, therefore I like classic rock because I like classic rock bands.

I couldn't run back home and get it cause I took the train from my house and rode about 4 stops up to the grocery store in Harlem so I couldn't just have the people behind me wait while i rode the train back home, so the cashier had to call someone over the loud speaker to void all the things and put it all back!

e4cce4fb6115df97b6140e853aeb9fcdaa	My overall opinion on the Twilight SAGA is that more books on romance should be written exactly like these novels. Stephenie detailed each character so carefully it wasn't hard to make your own movie in your head while reading the book and feel every emotion straight down to the smallest sigh. I love this saga and am on my second time reading the whole thing again.      The movie, however, was a disappointment to me. The characters fit, but personally the books gave greater detail the the shortened version movie did. I say this and can't wait to see New Moon. Twilight was a good movie don't get me wrong. I was just a little more on the edge of excitement walking in to the theatre and disappointed when I left.     I am a huge fan, like Bella I have always searched for why I am the way I am. Always looking for my purpose but fitting in to almost anywhere just never really fitting in on my behalf. I always had a fascination with fantasy analyzed in it at times to the point I would make myself believe it was true. Which I am sure everyone has. I am still looking for it every day.    I would like to find more authors that write with such clarity as Stephenie Meyer does. I am sure I won't even come close.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	It's a good book. It appeals mostly to the teenage generation. It's good, but it's only a book(okay movie now, but still).|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	corny...everything about it is just sooo damn corny.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	i do not care|`|AA11481862	twilight the movie? it was "OKAY" i'd give it a 5/10 maybe a 6 if they're lucky enough.  but the book? much better. 8/10    pretty little liars series is so much better|`|f5RzWf1Gaa	OH MY GOODNESS!!! I am SOOOOO obsessed!!! I love it overall because it's a cute story and intense at the same time. And OY VAY!! Edward cullen-let me grab a fan here woooo! He is so sweet and hott!!!! He loves bella so much and wants the best for her. Bella is not your average girl and that makes her cool.. .even though i would rather it be MOI :D the book held a lot more info than the movie though. I am apart of lots of fan sites for example: "Because of reading twilight i have unrealistic expectations in men" and all the cullens seem so cool and the history of carlisle is interesting. I can't wait to finish the series!!!!!  Oh and i saw this on a shirt-so trueeee- "TEAM EDWARD because Jacob doesn't SPARKLE" so true right?!??!?! I LOVE IT!!!     PS i still do LOOOVE the movie though I saw it first-who wouldn't want to stare at Edward all day?!??! I'd give up so much for him to be real/to stare |`|YL0DypySaa	Horrible. They don't deserve to be called books.     Sure, I'm a girl, I like reading meaningless girly books in between my philosophy and horror books, but those Twilight... things don't even work for that. =/|`|3BX15PwBaa	It sucked.|`|8CtqfHgoaa	I never seen it but I think it's overatted.|`|riMj9CWjaa	i'm addicted to it, but i am not an annoying fangirl.    love the book, the movie was alright.    =]|`|Q8ZlzjSqaa	LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  ITTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D:D|`|lvvlSiNEaa	I loved the book, but I think the person that plays Bella in the movie kinda ruined it. Edward Cullen is hott and I don't care if he's fictional!!|`|eQAEnmOPaa	Dammit, Edward, why aren't you real?!?|`|f19d1fa408561dbd2277d20975d7f605aa	Horrible.  4th Grade level writing.  Spelling and grammar mistakes.  No plot.  Sends out bad message to girls ( don't get me started on this one).  Too emo for my tastes.  Bad acting.  Bad actors/characters.  Oh and theres no vampires in the book, just fairies.   I could keep going....|`|rzY4XM6gaa	Pretty good books, GOOD STORY.    But...I don't understand why people are getting tattoos about it and twilight converse and raptly proclaiming  "I'm waiting for my Edward Cullen and his shiny volvo!!!!!!" while clutching a tattered twilight book to their bosoms and begging Robert Pattinson to bite their necks while joking they want to "la push" Jacob Black off a cliff.    They're good books and a good movie...(amazing soundtrack too...omg.)  But I don't get the screaming and the waiting like eight hours in line to see Rob P. and Taylor L. for five seconds and ask them to sign their team robert or team taylor panties and then go cry about it in the bathroom...    I mean, geez, people.  Get a grip.|`|dwMcsOFpaa	it's okay, but it's definitely overrated.|`|RtRYHKpDaa	I just read the book today.  It was bad. Do I really need to have a description of how beautiful Edward is every other paragraph? I get it, he's hot.  The movie was equally bad.    It is all bad.|`|izFAyfh8aa	i'm addicted to the book series! they're really good.  the movie was nice.  =]  overall, i love it. the fangirls are annoying sometimes.|`|vxQEqHvzaa	It's annoying because it gives girls false hope and glorifies being over-emotional.|`|6WQo6RpSaa	I haven't read the books or seen the movie, so I can't really have an opinion on it. But I never really did think vampires were even remotely close to "cool" in any way, so I have no desire to get into the whole Twilight craze any time soon.|`|Gm1K08Sqaa	The book is good. I read it. But its not obsessively good. Ive definately read better, but by all means i've read worse.    The movie really wasnt a good movie at all, but Robbert Pattison definately made it watch-worthy. I saw it twice in theatres. But movie wise, it really wasnt that great. I think they could have made it way better if they stuck more with the book and all that.    As for the fan base and everything else about it...im actually sick of hearing the word twilight. Its getting seriously overrated. Everything about it is getting old. People being obsessed about it, asking questions about it (no offence), even just talking about it ALL THE TIME.     Its good and all, just not something to get so obsessed about!!|`|sXD19xN8aa	I guess some fans are wayy overobsessed. Honestly, it's just a book, and it's not real, or a true story. It's made up. Anyway.      The book was amazing. And the movie, it was really good. They followed the book pretty well, overall.    Overall, it was really good. I'm just not obsessive with things.|`|FozOqe95aa	i'm really obsessed to twilight..  i both love the book and the movie..  thumbs up..|`|l3ukjXK0aa	Books were 10x better than the movie. I love the twilight series, but I'm not an obsessed fan girl...in fact its the obsession that teenage girls have that makes me dislike it, it is becoming overrated.    the person who played Bella in the movie needs to be shot because she did a horrible job, Rob looked hot as Edward cullen.

I did like their new song off of it though, I'm Outta Time.  Check it out.|`|7B2s7maWaa	It's fantastic imo.  One of the best albums I own.  If you can I would.  I strongly recommend it.  It's so refreshing and it's great to see them still around and still making wonderful music.|`|zCWsONZcaa	pretty good but What's The Story Morning Glory was much better

bRoFUcIgaa	I don't like J.D, he is probably my least favorite at the moment. I guess when he isn't drinking or drunk he's a pretty decent guy but he can't control himself when alcohol comes into the picture. Ryan, I find him fairly annoying- war this... war that... *we get it*. Chet, I'm on the fence about him. Sometimes I really like him and other times I can't stand him... there is no in-between. Scott's boring, he hasn't really been focused on in any of the episodes yet though which could partially be why. The only thing I know about Scott is that he's obsessed with working out and he's a model? I think he's a model, right? Don't quote me on that one.  Anyways though, I like Baya- she seems pretty chill and is good at dancing and will be successful with it I'm sure. As for Devyn, she's another "okay" character for me- she isn't all that great at singing in my opinion. All she ever talks about is Scott though, so I don't know much about her. I don't like or not like Katelynn, she's just "there". I like Sarah because she seems open and honest which is a good personality trait in my opinion, she also seems understanding and easy to talk to/eager to help others. She isn't boring, she actually has depth which is great.  Favorite= Baya/Sarah  Least favorite= J.D/Scott|`|st4e00qSaa	My favorites are J.D. and Chet -J.D. seems like a lot of fun and Chet is so laid-back    I'm really starting to disliking Sarah - The more I watch her, the more fake and manipulative she seems.    Baya is kind of bland, Devyn is annoying and cannot sing nearly as well as she thinks, Ryan's just a coward jerk with issues, and I could definitely see Scott going home in the near future. Katelynn...i guess she's alright.

I mainly listen to metal, but I started off with bands like Mushroomhead, Slipknot, Dragonforce, and Linkin Park. Then I went to hardcore **** like Suicide Silence, Whitechapel, Skinless, and Cannibal Corpse. Then I went to punk with bands such as NOFX, Leftover Crack, The Misfits, and Dead Kennedys. Now I currently listen to just plain metal or thrash bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Project 86, Trivium, a little Slipknot. I listen to some rap like Lil Wayne and Afroman.|`|nfgzaz2Daa	yes|`|ZkpqXIaaaa	Most definitely. I like MOST kinds of music and I go thru phases...depending on my moods...and what's going on in my life...also depends on my friends too...I sometimes get into music they are into & I learn new bands and such. Music is a HUGE part of my life. It moves my soul!!! Rock on!!!|`|g9QHFM49aa	i usually listen to the same KIND of music, but i obsess over different bands|`|8NxEtxqyaa	Yeah. I do that all the time.

But most (but not all) "Intellectual" types seem to possess a condescending attitude and little patience or regard for those they deem to be "beneath them" in intelligence. If a person is highly intelligent, yet does not possess an "Intellectual attitude"  then I will most certainly like and appreciate them, and yes, even date them.|`|EnoyJ1lCaa	Yes, actually i love people who I can hold intellectual conversations with.

AA12025213	Oooo, I love hang drums. A steel pan drum sounds sort of similar, and so does a singing bowl. But no instrument can even come close to the beauty of the hang. Sadly the only way to get them is off of eBay, or to write the Swiss makers a letter requesting one.     Note on getting a steel pan or a hang:    Since a steel pan is probably the most similar in sound to the hang, I figure I'd give you this advice. If you end up ordering either instrument, BE VERY CAREFUL. Since both are made out of specially formed metal, one dent in them will throw it out of tune to the point where you actually have to send it in and pay a hefty fee ($500 or more), to get it melted down and reformed again. This is a very big problem when learning steel pan drum, as you play with mallets, and when you're starting out, you generally want to play harder.    Hope this helps.
hOIWPsoxaa	This would really depend on the tempo of song. If it is slow, root and a mixture of third or fifth or inversions would be sufficient, but with a faster pace (alot of Brubeck stuff) it usually just comes out in spats of chord shapes and variations.    Movement is also quite common in the left hand during solos, but is often restricted to no more than a few notes. The pace would definitely determine alot.

I hate to break it to you, but you have never met him, and you can't love someone without knowing the real them, not the personality they use for interviews. I really don't think you ever will meet him, even if you do become famous, and if you did meet him, you may wish you hadn't... he might not be as great as he seems. You can't get him to marry you just by becoming famous and meeting him. He would have to fall in love with you and dump his GF. Good luck with that.    Sorry if that was mean or harsh, but I'm only being honest.|`|0jdOxNUVaa	Haha,  I think we all wish we could marry Justin Timberlake.:)

MfqHFQwbaa	A really good action anime would have to be Code Geass. All the episodes (up to 20-something) have been dubbed. It really is a great series. The first few episodes might be boring though, but its really worth it in the end. I even got hooked on it!     Another anime that is somewhat like Code Geass (but still alot of action and great plotlines) is Gundam 00. It has been dubbed in sci-fi and you can watch it on monday nights. It isn't that far along dubbedwise as Code, but it still has awesome depth.    A fully dubbed action anime would have to be Inuyasha, which was before mentioned. It has lots of gore though. It was actually my very first anime and in my childlike opinion was pretty good. But be prepared to sit through useless episodes of the same thing and 163 episodes.|`|GiRQ7Vuhaa	naruto, bleach, death note, wolf's rain, full metal alchemist, tsubasa chronicle, one peice,|`|TeQSlWodaa	Inuyasha.

(they messed up DBGT it was ok but it does not count and trust me i was a big fan of DBZ)Bleach The story opens with the sudden appearance of Soul Reaper Rukia Kuchiki in Ichigo Kurosaki's bedroom. She is surprised at his ability to see her, but their conversation is interrupted by the appearance of a "hollow", an evil spirit. After Rukia is severely wounded while trying to protect Ichigo, she attempts to transfer half her powers to Ichigo in order to let him face the hollow on equal footing. Ichigo instead unintentionally absorbs almost all her energy, allowing him to defeat the hollow with ease. The next day Rukia appears in Ichigo's classroom as a seemingly normal human, and informs Ichigo that his absorption of her powers has left her stranded in the human world until she recovers her strength. In the meantime Ichigo shelters Rukia in his home and takes over her job as a Soul Reaper, battling hollows and guiding lost souls to the afterlife realm known as Soul Society.    After a few months of this arrangement, in the sixth volume of the series, Rukia's Soul Reaper superiors find out about her giving her powers away (which is illegal in Soul Society) and send a detachment to arrest her, and sentence her to death. Ichigo is unable to stop Rukia, it gets better and better as you keep going and it is in english dub for about 100 episodes right now it's on 204 subbed hope this helps or you have already watched it and i'm wasting my time|`|LJzHR4zhaa	You didn't watch Naruto?!

wDJRyzE9aa	It wasn't a solo, but by far and away it was Eric Clapton who opened playing Lead Electric guitar "I Shot the Sheriff" when he played in Philadelphia.    Three notes into it one string broke and he continued without missing a beat and about half way through the song a 2nd string broke.  Again he adjusted, never missed a beat or a single note and finished the song to a standing ovation.  Most amazing thing I ever watched!|`|0cMVKUnAaa	Ohhh, I have many.

AA10916001	I do not know her personally so I cannot possibly say that i like or dislike her!|`|a8UX1tHLaa	1) Her music is pathetic. (If you seek Amy? Pathetic!) The lyrics are all about the fact that in her world, everything revolves around her, and everyone loves her. Sure, lots of guys think she is hot, but those guys are not the ones she should be with!  2) Pretty? Are you serious?  3) NORMAL?   4) This girl SURE doesn't want to be like her.  5) There is a point where the papporazzi can not be the only one to blame. A person has to stop hiding behind other things and take responsibility for her actions.  6) She is a horrible role model.   7) She might not have turned out so bad. But the whole being a child star completely messes people up. She has problems.  8) I do not hate the woman. She just needs to straighten up, stop being a slut, and stop looking for love and fulfilment in all the wrong places. I thought she was pulling her life together, and then she pulls more promiscuous crap with her songs.  But, on the bright side, now she wears panties!  9) Great concerts?? All she does is strip and do lap dances! I have BEEN to a Britney Spears concert. I left early.|`|GykCnbR7aa	i really don't pay that much attention to her but i can say she is very pretty|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Not at all. I have no time for cake, sponge, chocolate, or fruitcake like her.|`|e8o2eP6Zaa	Well, I love her music a lot, especially her newest sound. I think she's just having a hard time dealing with her massive popularity. She's so famous at a young age and it must be really tough on her. Her problems are caused by her lack of ability to deal well and because she doesn't know who to trust. The media also speculates tons of crap so it's understandable that she has issues.    I used to dislike her but after analyzing everything she's gone through, I came to the conclusion that her becoming famous at a young age (around 17) has affected her and I think that if people gave her some space, she would be okay. She seems to have made a great comeback now and hopefully she carries on this way.|`|EE1f7yNmaa	i lovee her. and ive liked her the whole time. my friend and i actually have a theory that she faked the whole crazy thing. i mean seriously look at the publicity she got. and any kind of publicity is good publicity =D.|`|NtFutamfaa	I love her music....who cares about her personal life...let her be  she has talent|`|JZGnKUMwaa	i think she looks pretty now and i luv her new songs! =]|`|9XsplTQIaa	I basically like her for all the reasons you like her and the fact that she is a EXCELLENT performer.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Angels in the Attic (1998)  aka Robin Hood Gang  IMDb review:  Two children find a bank robber's loot in the attic of their apartment block. Instead of telling someone or spending it on themselves as most youngsters would, they go around buying presents for their neighbors, whether they are needy or because they've lost something they loved. When the robber discovers they have taken his loot, he gives them an ultimatum: Return the money or else. But, the boys are in a dilemma: They want to give away all the remaining money for a life-saving operation for a neighbor's daughter. As you would expect, they ignore the danger to themselves and give the money away anyway.|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	I can't think of the title of an earlier movie (though I remember seeing it).  I can only think of this one:  Millions (2004)  The UK is about to switch its currency from Pounds to Euros, giving a gang a chance to rob the poorly-secured train loaded with money on its way to incineration. But, during the robbery, one of the big bags falls literally from the sky on Damian's playhouse, a 5-year old given to talking to saints. The boy (and his older brother) then start seeing what the world and the people around them are made of. Ethics, being human and the soul all come to the forefront in this film.  P.S.--I finally came across the title "Angels in the Attic"--after a bit of searching through my movie trivia folder that I've started for myself. Somehow, I need to organize my folder so that I can retrieve movie titles faster. I can't rely on my memory anymore. lol  Note: MystMoon thought of it first. She gets a "thumb's up" from me.|`|57e7865d60ee7efd9e478c51de8fe911aa	I agree that it's Angels in the Attic but I really like Millions better. The younger brother (played by Alex Etel) has an adorable, round face.
dfBYe4Vyaa	YES I REALLY LIKE IT    but i agree, depending on the song & melody, i might like it to start off a little different. it is like taylor swift in that it sorta feels like you dont know where you wanna start the song. but if there is a musical intro and the song doesnt just start of right there then i think it would flow fine.|`|DfgHAPAwaa	oh my god..  it's amazing (': did you write it?|`|476CZiIPaa	Did you write this?

FdUKvE6xaa	I think if he was younger, and could pass for your son, it wouldn't have been a problem. If you were seeing the movie in a theatre, you would've been considered a guardian, since you're over 21. I would think that it'd be the same for dvd's, but to be sure, you'd have to look up the law. It could be similar to other age limit type things. Like if you go to buy some kind of alcohol with a group of friends, and one of them is underage, the clerk would be violating the law by selling it to you (at least in NY, but probably most other states as well), and could lose their job.    Did you question the clerk or complain about it at all?  You should've asked to speak to the manager. Whether it was right or wrong, they should have a copy of the law on hand for you to look at to clear up any confusion.|`|XF1ctbrkaa	buy a dvd, or buy a ticket to an r rated movie?.. there is a world of difference.    At the theater they have every right.. if you were an older "friend" of some kind (my brother hung out with 20 + yr olds when he was 15) and his parents sued them because he did not have permission.. they'd be at fault..   You must be his legal guardian to buy a ticket for him, and even then some theaters will not allow it..  (as a parent could bring their kid.. the kid has nightmares or whatever, they sue and say they should have been warned that it was that bad.. etc.)   Buying a DVD is different..   if they watched your nephew hand you the money for it, that's one thing..  but otherwise it should have been allowed..|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Yes.  It could damage his little mind.|`|AA12134591	Now this would simply ... hack me off... I mean...really !  This is not a judgement call thing on the part of the employee OR the store itself as a matter of fact....  Their commitment to the law is not to sell these things to minors... that's it... period....  So, if you are not a minor... they have got no leverage in making any assumptions at all about your intent... who you have with you ... or any other call ...for that matter   I would opt not to trade with these people ever again...for any reason whatsoever... and, I'd let them know that...     ? ////|`|1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	They should have sold you two tickets and not said anything about it.|`|dDEwO3Cwaa	no it is not right, who ever wouldn't let you buy it was just being a jerk,|`|xqrwDmyUaa	No they are not allowed to refuse you buying a film if you are 17 and older. Rated R is under 17 so they had no right. I would complain to a manager immediately. This happened to my mother once, she was buying a video game that was rated M and the employee refused to sell it to her, after she asked how old the person playing it was (which btw was none of her business anyway). She went NUTS and demanded a manager, they sold her the game and the employee was reprimanded. That employee no longer works there, I guess she thought she had the right to quiz people about what they were doing with their games, she didn't. And this store employee has no right to refuse to sell you anything.|`|AA10895264	no, my mom bought me a r rated movie and i was right there|`|904b98e3003123549fac56c6334846a5aa	Depends on what the movie was.|`|MslcyESfaa	I agree, depends on the movie|`|dDgwMinYaa	Not really, i mean just because he was w/ you doesn't mean he's going to watch it and just because he wasn't with you doesn't mean he's not going to watch it.  The store has no way of knowing if you let him watch it.  And really, he's 15, I personally think he is old enough to watch a rated R movie.|`|SDCbm4c8aa	i think at 15, he saw worse thigns than rated r movies, no offense!  but i think hes allowed, he probably knows everything anyway.  actually, i think he might be interested and like rated r movies  so its no biggy!
ULjZChqmaa	Well, for school obviously a very clean song. But an upbeat one you can play around with, right? Try some of these songs- Kill The Director by The Wombats ( http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh62uaClnq... ) , In the Middle by Jimmy Eat World ( http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=TwbryjqQY0... ) or of course if your more into pop definetly try Poker Face by Lady Gaga, or Cross My Heart by Marianas Trench. For all of those, try scenery to go with it, air guitar, or maybe watch the real video for some ideas (no plagerism, though!)
m2vBJaHKaa	Ovguide ,tis the bet website, it has links to all the websites that have free movies - http://www.ovguide.com/     its not working for me either|`|sALPielpaa	I always search on http://www.flixplore.com (which is a free online movie search engine.)  It will give you multiple links from the best, most reliable sources for free online movies...in which case you can watch from different links/files.   I've always wondered if you clear your browser's cache & cookies if that would reset your 72 min. limit. (It should be under tools, clear private data on firefox.)|`|B0avgIpRaa	Watch-movies.net does not supply the movies, just the links to sites where the movie is. Mega video only allows 72min. Try another link to that movie. Hopefully another site is hosting it and you can watch it from there.|`|9AXKzzAjaa	Well here's the thing. You can either let the video start playing in MegaVideo then pause it, wait for it to load completely, then work offline. It cheats out the 72 minutes. Or you can stream using another link, that Watch-movies will bring you to. Its a smaller screen and the movie is split into sections but it isn't bad.     GOOD LUCK!|`|f5NFa55Laa	The thing with watch-movies.net is that the movies on the site are imported from other sites like Meagvideo. The thing is that megavideo does have that 72 minute thing and it is super annoying. I believe that if you go to the megavideo and sign up for their service you could watch te whole  movie for free. Go check it out for yourself. I will stick with watch movies it is the most reliable. And hey, the movie are FREE, we really can't complain too much. You know the whole beggars can't be choosers thing.|`|vUT0WEzdaa	its just the megavideo.  even tho it says you have to wait 54 mins until you can finish the movie, if you close the browser within the first couple of mins, it should only be about 25 mins.   this isnt too bad,  just when you start watching the movie again,  fast forward to where you left off.  check other links too  youku and zshare dont do that

6pUzzsuhaa	i would be a farmer if i had the chance to right now- why- because of the feeling you get from planting something and watching it grow    its interesting because every year is new, nothing is the same as the past year or the past month or the day before. it all changes and each day you learn something new too    i understand it's hard work, but a love for it will over-ride how much hard work it is.  i answered your other question too (: and my bf is a farmer and has been all his life and he LOVES farming and it's also in his blood- he's a 4th generation farmer and he wants his own farm of at least 1,000 acres. he's also been in a tractor since he was about 12/13 too.     i would hate to have a city job- i'm looking in to a job in agriculture- like a livestock vet or something to that extent.     like i said, you learn something new every day and it's NEVER boring    and if you meet a farmer and talk to them, you'll have a new understanding and won't get upset when your behind a tractor on the road either|`|CDBRXtnLaa	that is a maybe because my uncle is a farmer and its nice being on the ranch with no problems just us 2 and the whole 50 acers but also some jobs he makes me do like if he wants to chop some wood with the wood chopper of course i would help him and my uncle is elderly like a grandpa to me and i dont want him to work too hard so i help him and i love him|`|AA10565295	I would never want to be a farmer. :( They do so much. Waking up at the crack of dawn and working well into the afternoon is too much for me.     It is interesting, though; they have so many skills and know so much about so many animals! I wish I had that kind of knowledge (but not enough to be a farmer lol).    I do.    Not boring, you probably make a lot of good animal friends that way. I'd rather do a city job though. When you work on a farm, all you do is wish and wonder about cities and suburbs. I'd rather just be here and do the opposite. lol    16.|`|NWLxP3iEaa	I did trade the city life for a farm life.  An adventure and a dream.  It is interesting, a total different way of life, lots to learn,  hard work.  Back in the city|`|2k8TEiRtaa	I would like to be a farmer. Because they are decent people who make a living and have something about them. like a certain freedom. even if they do work hard. I love horses and I would not want to work in the city . The city is boring. I like the wide open spaces to move around.|`|uUwjynYyaa	i wish i had relatives that were farmers, i'd love to help out occasionally but the hard work everyday would be too much.

Everyone deserves a chance, but then again if we pulled out the kids that are about to drop out then we could focus on spending money and time into kids that will pass to make them more successful in there futures.|`|2ca9a87135087d38a7252d24603b5e86aa	No. What these students need is attention and good counsel. Teachers should have a 'discerning wisdom' to give more   attention to students who appeared to be troubled, might be  encountering family problems and the like.|`|7VnmPYuXaa	If it's cheaper on the school district I'm for it if it is an added expense, I'm against it. My local taxes are high enough!|`|kT7GCNnCaa	Doing that is simply a trick by the school district to keep their graduation rates up.  It is an example of a society that decides a fate of a person before ever giving them a chance.  I was a victim of this and after more than 30 years I am still the only person to have gone to higher education after being forced into such a program in my community.  Was this program a success or a failure....   FAILURE.  It was set up to create failure not success in a person.    I called recently for my transcripts and they had boxed them up in the basement of the school and thought I was playing a joke or a suprise inspection because they couldn't believe that someone who was forced into such a program could achieve higher education.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	I am at risk according the 3/4 of the world, yet I am striving in everything I do. If they want to drop out and get a GED, let them. If not, it is their own fault if they end up working at McDonald's. A lot of schools do everything possible to make sure everyone graduates. Each individual determines for themselves if they want to graduate. Why waste the time to fix something when they do not want to fix it themselves?|`|Gsfp1tEEaa	yes my school is having that right now and ive been able to work better, they are of risk to students|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Each student will be different. I definitely think they should be given all those options.|`|WgIZUcYfaa	No. They should have the right to choose. All high school students know that getting your GED is an option. They have guidance counselors to help them with those decisions. If you posed a high risk of contracting aids or cancer would we kill you? I don't think so....|`|AwicI0VJaa	No i think that they should be kept in a regular school and if they do drop out then the alternatives can be considered|`|AIJgbvIcaa	No. By high school students have actually made up thier mind on whether they want to stay in school or not. Moving them won't help.|`|AA12383908	No they should get a chance.|`|6Zmy02HFaa	if there likely to drop out, what would consider them to stay in a program.|`|OxaonF5aaa	should get more chances|`|VJlUpfjBaa	No they should be sent to the Fast Food School for Tards.|`|gK7kuyQqaa	And they're in risk of dropping out because they have parents who are so caring, willing to do homeschool?

I wish I could propose some legislation that addresses these situations.  Of course they can get a ged but many don't and have no skills for the job market.  Underachievers should have the opportunity to persue a trade while in hs without feeling like they gave up on school.  They should feel good about themselves and look forward to being productive citizens.|`|AA11900730	the GED program deff,|`|7NbG4gnRaa	wtf? why would they do that?|`|uHTpBjWDaa	I  think they should not be forced into anything but have those options available.|`|LZXax4KUaa	I don't think so.   It wouldn't be fair because they might just be slacking and not willing to do the work, therefore not making the marks and dropping out, while other kids who might even have the same environments take education seriously, yet get no one-on-one attention because they're assumed to be ok on their own.|`|81a57ad7f12fcc6ab8901872187e4a42aa	I think they should be given the option, but I would never tell someone they should give up on earning their diploma in exchange for a GED.

There is a funny video on YouTube with the music. Just search for "The Godfather Mattresses Montage" and you'll find it.

For example, if you already have a good computer, $199 for FL + $199 for a MIDI controller with drum pads will get you a better product than a $5,000 MPC.    You will have to invest time to learn your way around a DAW, but that goes for hardware as well. Youtube has tons of tutorials for things like FL Studio and Reason and relatively few for thing like a Motif/Fantom workstation...

Which is going to be hard because they wont change the basic formula of the movies because they're afraid that it will diminish the success of the film, that's why Peirce Bronson refused to make any more bond movies unless they brought bond into the modern age and now they've brought out a prequel, speaks volumes about the producers of the movies to me.|`|AA10762620	hey-you are trashing a movie that you have not seen. that is wonderful|`|fda0a949fe27633df30f04adb24c3ffaaa	The latest Bond film is a remake of the FIRST Bond film, "Casino Royale", since they ran out of Ian Fleming 007 stories to make movies of, they are taking the easy route and just remaking the same tired old crap.

7f1f1f628dbf51170611af6ac5f6f94daa	Ghost Story was a horror anthology series that aired from 1972 to 1973. Like Rod Serling in Twilight Zone and Night Gallery, host Sebastion Cabot introduced each tale of terror. After 13 episodes, the host was dropped and the title of the show was changed to Circle of Fear. This auction is for the complete set of Ghost Story / Circle of Fear episodes. This includes every episode from the only season aired in 1972-1973. Due to the rarity and age of this series, the quality on this set is around a 7 out of 10. The rarer pilot episode is a 6.     This is an EXCELLENT Collectors item and is virtually impossible to find elsewhere:|`|8e2fc0d9eeaea4fc7ad3f7ed395621a8aa	Poofh, into thin air........ wow Is that the kind of  air thats in "the middle of nowhere?"

AA11931988	I love my job, I love the pay!  I love it more and more each day.  I love my boss, he is the best!  I love his boss and all the rest.    I love my office and its location,  I hate to have to go on vacation.  I love my furniture, drab and gray,  And piles of paper that grow each day!    I think my job is really swell,  There's nothing else I love so well.  I love to work among my peers,  I love their leers, and jeers, and sneers.    I love my computer and its software;  I hug it often though it won't care.  I love each program and every file.  I'd love them more if they worked a while.    I'm happy to be here. I am. I am.  I'm the happiest slave of the Firm, I am.  I love this work, I love these chores.  I love the meetings with deadly bores.    I love my job - I'll say it again -  I even love those friendly men.  Those friendly men who've come today,  In clean white coats to take me away!|`|AA10042710	I love my job. You have to love what you do to do my job.

Yes, I happen to love my job.  I'm a Home Organizer.  Just finished  a job organizing for a very large graduation party.   Which means  I'm movin' tables, power washing patio furniture, decorating the party to match the colors of the graduating school in this case blue and yellow which means table clothes match flowers on the table ended up being Gerbera Yellow daisy's in colebalt blue vases......why there was even Blue Delphinium flowers planted in the yard so even the garden would match the decor.  I also do Halloween Parties, Christmas. Organizing all the decorations up in peoples attics or basements/garages.  Will organize every inch of their home if that's what they want.  I have them write out of list of things that are stressing them out that they've been meaning to do but haven't...then I do it.  I'm called The Motivational Organizer.  Love it!  Very tiring at times. Furniture moving is a task.  And attics if that's what I'm doing that day  can get very hot! I'm never surprised if I come home and find cobwebs in my hair (usually where a hat when I'm playin' with the bugs! LOL)  But it's all part of the job and I'm good at it so work work work....money, money, money!  Hope thats enough about my job...click on my site if you need to more!

32b1cde92a4560f25f2688545dd69561aa	Okay, first put the frame together, the entire ring, legs and all. Then set out the tarp in the middle, spread it out, line up the metal loops with the holes. Now start putting in springs as far apart from each other as possible. Put in one, and then put in the one directly across from it. This should be easy for a while and will start to get difficult.    Now, you need a special tool to stretch the springs from the loops to the holes on the frame... It's *drum roll please* a short piece of rope. Pull on either end of the rope, hook it through the hook on the spring, will always give you enough leverage to stretch the spring and click it into the hole.    My father even uses the hook of another spring to stretch the springs out, but I don't recommend that, as it can pitch the meat of your hand. Use some rope. Maybe tie a knot in each end. It makes a world of difference.|`|AA12340453	Read the instructions|`|b6b628ba201bc6abe95b6e7ff2744c3baa	Yea, look for the instruction sheet.
AA12340453	Because boys Drool!|`|AA12302812	They don't RULE, but they are pretty cool. (I'm one myself.) We always know how to dress, shop, and make guys go crazy.

I think just because they are more careful than boy, and they always want to make things perfect, and looks pretty like dress up. Boy are more active than girls, so most of them don't rule.

100eb6c59950a5ea604a1b4c7e9c735eaa	I think Naruto's the strongest.    He beat Gaara when they fought.    The Shukaku (Ichibi) has been extracted on Gaara, so he weakened.    Before Sasuke left Konoha, he fought Naruto because he became jealous of him because he sees that Naruto's becoming stronger than him, so he challenged Naruto in a battle. None of the win, because Kakashi intervened, but seeing what Naruto did to the water tank, he became more jealous.    Currently in the manga, Naruto is on a training, that might surpass Kakashi, to become even stronger than Sasuke and to save him.|`|bc3bfab1763d1b4104ae01f205efb70faa	1|`|dc52cba82973e7b55620481cc6fd2423aa	Well....Sasuke and Naruto kicked Gaara's @$$, and Sasuke kicked Naruto's @$$ (in the beginning of the anime show)and Naruto kicked Sasuke's @$$. I think that Sasuke and Naruto are pretty much equal.|`|AA12187618	in manga right i would have to say Sasuke is strongest but at one point they all were the strongest i would have to say that at the start of the chunin i would say that Gaara was the strongest but alittle after the exams ended sasuke and naruto were stronger than gaara i think and then after getting Tsunade Naruto is stronger but after getting the level 2 curse seal sasuke got stronger again and after training with Orochimaru Sasuke is stronger than them|`|ee4f7dc84897327273e7edd18396005caa	Naruto is the strongest. He should be. The show is named after him.|`|AA11484173	Naruto,he has more potential.|`|8c73b1b7ecf1837d6f4aee602918ee61aa	naruto...the best!!!!|`|643874d7d1ca61164bb866f15609b077aa	It depends on the situation.  In general, since the show is named "Naruto" and not "Sasuke" or "Gaara", then Naruto would naturally be the strongest.  His Kyuubi is amazing, and his inner strength is incomparable.  No one in the show, not even Sasuke, had Naruto's resolve, which we clearly see when he goes up against Gaara and beats him.    However, we have to remember that Sasuke did defeat Naruto at the waterfall, with the help of Orochimaru's seal.  Of course, we could say that Sasuke has an unfair advantage in having both the cursed seal and a Bloodline Limit, but then again, isn't it a bit unfair that Naruto has a demon with nearly limitless chakra inside him?  In general though, Naruto is still more powerful than Sasuke is.  Sasuke only gained the power to defeat Naruto due to his own avarice and thirst for vengeance.     As for Gaara, Naruto soundly beat him during the Chuunin exams.  There was no doubt that despite Shukaku, Gaara couldn't overcome Naruto (probably because he was mentally unstable).  But if Naruto were to challenge Gaara on his home turf, especially after the two year skip in the manga, Naruto would probably die.  In a fair match in the desert, there is very little chance that anyone could beat Gaara.      The situation varies...but in general, Naruto is the strongest.|`|dacf04cfe22ff4b3bc4955cc96123af1aa	Personally, I think Gaara is the best... that is, until Naruto kicked his butt.. but Sasuke has no chance against either of them|`|AA10141583	Gaara|`|3016da1d92bd8a194a07174c2c80244faa	So far in where im where sauka is way way strong.He even beat the nine tail fox demon inside naruto whitout even droping a sweat!!!!!!!!!

But naruto will become stronger than Sauska.|`|97ad4000205cd5fbabbf6e0087de7c43aa	Naruto . because he's main character and the future horkage =p|`|6133d33425b94c484ed05ccb1b6f031eaa	Naruto, no kidding!|`|72f0262086841a3a2a7195eac9cd155faa	gaaarrrararaarara|`|b8a1b26945c3bbd5ac53e628bbaddf21aa	Naruto, because he kicked Gaara and Sasuke's @$$. And he learns much faster than Gaara and Sasuke!!!!!|`|ca1e4c7d9dda70b30837f172de13d200aa	As long as Naruto taps into the Kyuubi's chakra, i'd say he's the strongest.    But in light of recent [manga] events, i would have to say Sasuke, since he's able to suppress the Kyuubi's chakra.

AA12063459	Yes I've always thought she was psychotic. I believe that at some point during her relationship with that husband she also wore his blood in a vile around her neck (and I think he wore hers too.) The also were making out on the red carpet to the Oscar's one year and bluntly told reporters: "We just f*cked in the limo."|`|AA10492681	I think like most celebrities, she does weird things to keep herself in the media.|`|AA11371390	yes. or her making out with her brother that was gross|`|dd83c62fdfa61299c06f88bc11d575b9aa	I think she's a freak that severely needs attention, so she'll do anything to get it, like dress like Elvira on the red carpet. She's such a wacko-- I feel bad for her kids.|`|AA12349394	I think she is very dedicated no matter what.  She is a very deep passionate soulful person.|`|AA11507748	not psychotic... just a little strange.  but i think she's cleaned up her image a lot since she adopted maddox and left billy bob.

d1d6b46b71544bd11e11d8886427534eaa	I have played piano since I was 5 (I am 25 now). I took lessons until I graduated from high school. The most important thing you need is patience. You are not going to be able to play cool stuff in a day. Probably not even in a year. It takes forever to learn piano. Especially if you are trying to teach yourself. I would advise paying a professional to teach you. At first it is going to be very boring, learning to read music, the different scales, finger exercies...etc...but if you really really want to learn stick with it. I used to hate going to my lessons the first few years. I wanted to play fun stuff that I knew, not the boring lessons the teacher had. But I stuck with it and now I can play whatever I want. I can sit down, read any sheet music, and just play it. I love playing. Once you get better at it and have more freedom to pick out the kind of stuff you want to play you will have more fun with it. It is a great thing to learn, but you really have to put alot of time and dedication in to it. Good luck!|`|AA10640922	go to your local music store and ask about piano instructors in the area. feel free to call all of them, and ask for info. they're usually very open. lessons should cost between $10-15, don't pay anymore. piano is one of the best skills to have. hope this gets you started. good luck|`|AA11276839	i play, just for fun now i stopped taking lessons a few years ago, but yeah i think you should learn, its not a very hard instrument and it'll feel great when you'll be able to play Bach easily. its all about the teacher you choose, mine was great she used to be a concert pianist she was pretty old but still sharp. you should feel really good about your teacher. and remember practice makes prefect...:) good luck|`|AA10786616	Do simply music..it's a great program fro learning.. Just look it up on google. good luck
dff514125e45d8eece677c98bd44b6f2aa	You're right.  Most of the things seen on gossip shows, television, magazines, are bullocks.  I'll tell you another thing:  most things in Hollywood are not what they seem, even if the celeb is saying it him/herself.  Know why?  Because it's all about publicity.  Publicists make their living keeping their clients in the limelight, even if that means lying.  Most Hollywood couples are not "real" couples.  They are but two celebs put together to bring results.      Why do people care about the lives of celebs?  Because the lives of celebs appear to be much more interesting than their own.  "Appear" being the key word here.|`|702403ec9907c878e95b800a6910d4e6aa	cause they have no life of their own|`|afe58694f839bf992398ea971169fbdeaa	Some people are just bored and have very little excitement in their own lives, therefore, they live vicariously through the lives of others.|`|148e00a2086c8b7e82a46ef84076dd8caa	They do this because they have no lives of their own and hence must enthrall themselves with the misdoings of celebrities.

AA10829598	a company that makes audio/stereo speakers|`|AA10773491	ummm i think u contact your nearest radio/t.v station and talk to them! get like a patent for it too so no one steals your idea!|`|AA11618877	You should  contact a big Company that sells that stuff, and say that you have a suggestion. You could look on their website for ways to contact  them.|`|AA12274374	Go to the marketing departments of the stores that sell audio/stero speakers.  If they dont have a marketing department, find out who their ad agency is and contact them.  Or ask if that particular ad agency has any freelance work needed and do some freelance ad work for them. While you're there, make your pitch!! Goodluck!

AA11890416	Shag a roadie. Get into catering. Get a press pass. Get in a band. Work at a venue.|`|AA11467896	What I found and heard is, if you get to soundcheck which is like a few hours before the actual concert, hang around and be normal to everyone and try and talk to the security, roadies.... all I can suggest. I went to a concert earlier this year and got into soundcheck by just walking in, and this was for a big band.|`|AA11981714	put out|`|AA11183805	BJ's.|`|186ad6184d2ffcc5ec0dbed566ccfce4aa	find a very close friend of the band, win a contest or some bands offer them for serious cash online
AA11622823	I've seen Real Sex but not Sex Bytes.    Real sex still comes on from time to time.  Granted, I have like 8 HBO channels on satellite and can find it when it comes on any of those channels.  Sex Bytes I've never even heard of.    I know that wasn't much help, but eh.|`|1a6170c829b26a04064a44e075299f00aa	Contact HBO I'm sure they would love to sell you copies. Good Luck
e82b22b4c16e2120bc667f804a316142aa	Get like a handful and tell the person you can make the handful very cold. Get into it. Act like youre concentrating, and mumble incoherently under your breath. Open your palm and tell them to feel the pennies. When they begin to get their face close, just chuck the pennies into there face.|`|134c5d5883297a507f9e6338ac1086ceaa	This works with pennies as it does with any coin,   but it demands a slight of hand.  Show them the face (either heads or tails) of the coin that is on your open palm (palm facing up and fingers close together). your hand must be over a stable flat surface as on a table.   Then with a slight of hand, (this must be practiced) quickly turn your palm downward without curling it.  The speed is such that the turning is fast enough to cover the coin in the same position and ending with it on the table with your palm covering it.  this trick makes them wonder why they see the same face inspite of being turned over.    just a simple trick.|`|c2dba357c07fc63041beacf029a27126aa	http://www.thisismagic.com/html/coin_mag...    Try that link i checked it out and all u have to do is click on the trick u want to learn and it tells u how to do it    i hope that helps abit i did a search on yahoo to find it if u want to try that u might get a better site

AA11816854	I am a huge metallica fan and have all their albums but I never heard them sing a song that goes tick tick etc. Maybe they were singing someone else's song. Did you hear them play it at a concert?|`|AA12149018	the song name is FRANTIC from st.anger album(2003) the first song ov the album|`|AA12196547	Possibly the song "Enter Sandman" on the Black album....need more info honey...I know most all of Metallicas songs, but tick tock doesnt ring a bell......|`|3864db247ca31eb2e0db165320b18dc8aa	The song is Frantic from the album St. Anger. I am pretty sure... I remember recalling "Frantic -tic-tic-tock" being part of the song... it's the first song of the album too.

AA11691363	You can't... there's no way to look up a Yahoo! ID or a real name and get their nickname or profile.    You could try using a Keyword search, but unless the person used the word you're searching for as part of their "In my own words" section, you won't be able to find them.    This is all done to give users some anonymity and privacy.|`|AA12021493	probably not. how many different people have the same name??? come on

You know most of you are not very good children, because you like don't pray for me or nothing. Yeah, and also you don't come to visit me much at church. You treated your brother Jesus really bad when he went down there. I am disappointed in you. I just can't keep arguing with you kids anymore, you just don't listen. So as punishment, I am going to hand your fates over to Uncle Lucifer. Yeah, he will teach you what happens when you misbehave. If you come pray to me because Uncle Lucifer is giving you a hard time I'm going to be like, "yeah, whatever. You only come to me when you need something." So, yeah, I just don't care about you. As far am I'm concerned I HAVE NO CHILDREN!! *then God goes back to heaven and cries*|`|AA10356243	I could crack jokes about it saying stuff like what most of the radio and tv preachers say about donations to save your soul...    But truthfully, He will probably say how loving he is and wind up taking calls from the heart and answering them (no telephone .. he will just announce somehing to know who it's meant for and the answer in his around about way as we probably couldn't comprehend the complexities of everthing needed to get what we ask for about in our lives sometimes...|`|44332dbfb6690b0d3565d73afcd5417faa	REPENT!!!!!
