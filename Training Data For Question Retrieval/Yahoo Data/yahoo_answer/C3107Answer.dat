zfueTHk2aa	I've done a few transactions on eBay and the shipper shouldn't send the item until payment clears. If it doesn't clear, it hasn't legally been purchased yet. Tell the person that you'll wait for payment verification to send your phone to them.     Also, I believe eBay does have a "report member" feature somewhere. Feel free to report him and list him as a possible scam.|`|5w5su7Zcaa	Yes you have been conned, hope you haven't sent the item yet and Paypal don't ask for tracking numbers first if they paid it would go straight into your account and paypal would contact you if anyone tried to make any payments.  Report this seller to ebay|`|XAIuOZn1aa	Watch out! I smell a rat.  My sister had the same story and it is a con I'm afraid.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	If you sold your phone...aren't YOU the seller?|`|9f3784bdf3bdc20b62d4d53dedacfdfeaa	Trap!!  Anything from Nigeria is a trap.  Notify eBay and Paypal and do not send them the item.  In your Paypal account, refund the monry to the seller and telll them you are not selling to them.  What they are trying to do is say they never got it so then they will get the item + the refund anyway|`|C3sqTngtaa	contact ebay ASAP chuckles|`|S5H0NmEWaa	Exactly the same thing happened to me. I was told to send the item to the buyer's son in Nigeria. Report them to eBay and don't do anything with your item. THe only bummer is that you have to wait for them to get back to you before you can legitimately put the item back up for resale. Just don't send it anywhere!

1up5ij4iaa	I don't want to discourage you, but its the wrong time to get into the transportation business.  Call local companies and they will tell you how much they are hurting.  My husband owns a small limo company and we are lucky to have enough work to just keep our employees busy, but our owner operators and about 70% of the companies we work with are crying for work.  Car service is a luxury item.    Be ready to spend around $10,000 a month to just keep your company going in hard times.  Whats included is car insurance, liability insurance, gas money, cars, licensing, Workman's comp, etc.  And that's if you keep the cars at your house.  Many towns do not allow more than one commercial vehicle to be located at residential houses.    Make sure you are ready to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  No vacations, no time off.    Before you do this- make sure you work for a company first.  Also make sure you have strong clientele lined up before you get your first car.  The car itself will be around $40-50k just for a sedan.
AA11452852	As you probably know, amygdalin, the substance called "Vitamin B-17" is not really a vitamin, and it has been very controversial. Because it is related to laetrile, which was marketed as a cancer cure but was mostly found to be ineffective, it has only quasi-legal status.  That's why you can't find it in normal drug and nutrition stores.      If you want to buy amygdalin, you will probably have to order it online.  And please consider it as an adjunct therapy that you use in addition to proven treatments.  Don't rely on amygdalin by itself.  There is little real proof that it does anything useful.      I wish I could give you more encouragement.  I do wish you well, and I hope this helps!!|`|AA10282618	Try puritan pride mail order they are fast or Lee nutrition|`|4af842ebb27dff73588a9d7e7768238caa	Her you go.

NfSLXHU3aa	I thought this would be something easy to find, but as you know, it's not.    Spouses of Ft. Bragg's soldiers started something called Operation Kid Comfort.  They use photo quilt blocks and make a quilt.    You might want to take photos and have someone transfer them onto fabric.      Type "quilt soldiers" in ebay and flag/soldier quilt blocks will appear.    You (or someone) can either make it into a quilt or sew the bottom and sides to a flannel sheet for a duvet type of blanket.

The place is so huge, you'll have to make a day of it.     Bring your digi camera to take pics of your favorite setups, and grab a catalog as you walk around. Go home and make you decisions! Not at the store! this way you know exactly how it'll look when you get it.    Don't forget to bring some extra cash for lunch too! They have the best lingonberry juice ever! (free refills too, lol!)    Good luck!|`|ED9HMQIvaa	Ikea in Jersey, they have shuttles!
