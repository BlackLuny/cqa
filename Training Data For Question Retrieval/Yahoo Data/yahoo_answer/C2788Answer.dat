Do up 48 BIG burritoes for about 20 bucks. Then put them in the freezer. You'll get full on 1 instead of 2 or 3 and they'll taste better, have less chemicals, AND you can sell half of them for a buck a piece, still have 24 burritoes, AND beer money.

JfVxCDb7aa	ask for medium rare...|`|cu8fUJbMaa	I own a restaurant and am not aware of any law stating you can't order meat rare. Some restaurants will refuse to cook a burger rare simply because ground meat contains a high level of bacteria from all the handling/processing it goes thru. Others will serve you a rare burger, but will have a disclaimer on their menu regarding the danger of undercooked shellfish, eggs and meats. Health codes recommend cooking a burger to a specific temperature, but it isn't a law, just an advisement to avoid illness. Personally, I do not allow burgers served rare simply because I don't want the liability of potential E.Coli or other food-borne pathogens, nor do I want to take a chance that someone might eat a burger and become ill and give me a bad rep because they were stupid enough to eat it rare and blamed my cook because they got sick!  LOL|`|JlyYRBCIaa	I think that you can order meat filets rare, but usually there is a warning posted somewhere that undercooked meats could kill you. I think that they will not serve hamburgers rare, because there is a much higher risk for severly undercooked hamburger meat (ground beef). I think it has to be med rare or medium at least|`|flKkoiwbaa	Regulations may vary by state, but I've never been anywere you couldn't order a steak as bloody rare as you wanted it!<br>  <br>  A few years back after the big E. coli scare, many of my local restaurants started refusing to serve GROUND meat rare, because of the risk of E. coli.  But now that fear seems to have worn off.  But it's never been a problem with meats served whole, rather than ground.|`|p8wMvkltaa	Although some restaraunts will not cook you rare meat, many will. however, they make it quite clear that it is at your own risk. : )

You could go to seaworld or somewhere out to dinner or to a club and party!!
cwEO2tGtaa	i think you should have talked to a manger they  might have  acted like they cared more. then i would have said i want my money back on my card if you dont have time to make the order im sure that they would take care of you then and if not atleast you would get your money back and can go somewhere else|`|Y7DBhONraa	They don't have time for anything except messing up orders and being rude!!!|`|hg5I1O2xaa	I would have talked to the manager.|`|v0p45HNXaa	I think you need psychological help. Making up stories is a bad sign.|`|QebfMqdMaa	Honestly, I'm a pretty chill person so this would've pissed me off, but not to the point that I'd start cussing. ESPECIALLY considering that the person you were cussing at was the one making your food...why antagonize someone who could do God knows what to your food??<br>  <br>  I'm just saying...<br>  <br>  Anyway, I tend to just roll my eyes at people like that and let them get on with being douche bags. No point in stooping to their level, IMO. Given, the worker had no right to say that since they were the one(s) who messed up your order, but there's something to be said about letting things go in one ear and out the other.|`|tzPEckiZaa	You shouldn't have done anything. Just taken your fixed order and left. No need to start a public argument. It makes you look trashy.|`|4wezI8toaa	i would of said well make some fuken time *****|`|pueeMH6gaa	Okay, I've given this answer before but let me repeat it. Wait until the idiot is working at cleaning tables. Go into the bathroom and fill the toilet with paper towels.  Take a massive dump and then flush the toilet about a hundred times until it's really overflowing. Go back to the moron and say "clean up required in the bathroom and make it quick before I call the health department." At this point, quickly leave and never go back.  Got it?|`|fjTuNCHRaa	i dont think people understand what its like to work at a fast food place. it just so happens that, just because you have come here to eat, it doesnt mean we drop all other orders and cater to you. people make mistakes. it happens.<br>  <br>  the person definitely shouldnt have said "i don't have time for this", but you need to calm down too, and realize that maybe the employee had 248234 other orders to do, and in fact, you are not the center of  the universe.<br>  <br>  btw, to Fat Tay, how would you like cleaning that up? because ppl have done that at my place of work, and let me tell you, it just gives me so much joy to clean it. nothing else i'd rather do. and remember, i'm the one handling your food.
qE5XIAsYaa	lol...that is ghetto and he did ruin it for all of you. I hate when people do things like that. It's annoying. I lke 5 guys restaurant in DC|`|VDpmh2VJaa	that's ghetto and yes he did ruin for it everyone.  There was a guy in my town in fla who went to eat the free breakfast buffet at Hampton Inn.  he got caught and now has to pay 10 bucks for it....the sheriff said;)  so they may make him pay up if someone reports it.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Of course he's Ghetto. He will not ruin it because 5 Guys is making lots of money and peanuts are there to draw you in. They don't get to many Kofi's who are scumbags.

There are many places to stay along Coast Highway and everywhere is walking distance; so you can spend more time together and go to a few different places.  The rooftop bar is a good place to start, it has amazing views for sunset then there are many places to eat right around there (Sapphire, Mosun or Hush) or you could just venture downstairs to K'ya.  The restaurants are amazing in Laguna.
