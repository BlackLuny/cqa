Subway ticket   Cab ride   Lunch/Dinner   Beer/Wine   Typical night out   Traveling expenses (Patagonia, Iguazu, Peru, Uraguay, Mendoza)    Other expenses      One reason that I chose Argentina over Spain was to have the financial ability to do almost anything that I want.

I was looking at korean music videos the other day on youtube, and I found this video with a korean man and woman dancing together. The guy reminded me of Rain somewhat, and had a similar attitude. The video was rather plain, and the man, roughly about 20-30 years old, was wearing a suit. The woman wasn't singing. The guy kept singing something that sounded like "Quiet!" but I'm not sure if that was what he was saying, or if it was a korean word that sounds similar. Does anyone know who this singer is, or what the song is called? I really wish I could find the video again, but I clear my history regularly so...yeah. Sorry this isn't very specific.

I'm going to take a trip to Los Angeles later on this month, it's for a meeting.I'm thinking of leaving on Thursday night and arriving for the meeting on Friday afternoon, and depending on my time, maybe I'll stay there through Sunday morning, or if I'm busy at that time I'll leave earlier. The thing is, I don't know if I should drive or fly. I haven't booked the hotel yet because I still don't know when it'll be exactly. I just know that it's going to take place later on this month. So can you guys tell me if it's preferable to drive or just to fly?
20090202162901AA3lUQ7	Travel;Canada;Vancouver	Trail between British Properties and Capilano Road(Dam)?	Now, I was walking through the trail that leads from Gilmore to Dam Road and Capilano Road when I noticed that trail could EASILY be a road. The only problem is the water storage is right there, and there's a big margin of gate that's protecting nothing, yet could easily be taken off so people could drive through there. It would be so much easier to get to Edgemont Village and Lonsdale but they just had to put that margin of gate there just to piss me off.

OK here is the deal...I need some ideas on where to go on a senior trip...sounds easy right...yeah well I am in a home school group and my class is having some problems agreeing on where to go...we are all going with our moms because most of us will be under the age of 18 so that will be a total of probably 16 people. I want to go either on a cruise or to disney world but some of the families are kind of being difficult and won't go anywhere they haven't gone already as a family so that means both of my ideas are out the window...I live in Oklahoma and I don't really want to go to Texas, Missouri, or Kansas because I have been there more than once and seen about all there is to see. It has to be something that is under like 1000 dollars per person because us seniors are going to have to raise all of the money. If you have any ideas please post....I'm completely out of ideas.

20090202163907AAyL6FP	Travel;United States;Denver	How much would you pay for a home in Denver, Colorado?	I'm an Interior Designer working on a big housing project for the company I work for, and I decided to ask real people what they think their rent costs should be. I'm very anti-corporation, and we all know big companies inflate the prices of homes to turn profit which they don't even need. So I want your opinions on what you think is right and wrong based on your yearly income and family situation.      How much would you pay monthly for...      2 levels, Ibdrm, 1/1/2 bath, 1125 sq feet   125 sq foot balcony, 300 sq foot backyard, 125 sq foot side yard   1 car garage (with extra outdoor parking)   Would be perfect for: a single, or a couple with no children      2 levels, 2 bdrms, 2/1/2 bath, 1800 sq feet   350 sq foot backyard, 150 sq foot side yard   1 car garage (with extra outdoor parking)   Would be perfect for: a couple/single with one older child, or two smaller children.      2 levels, 3 bdrms, 2/1/2 bath, 2350 sq feet   100 sq foot balcony, 600 sq foot backyard, 175 sq foot side yard   2 car garage (with extra outdoor parking)   Would be perfect for: any family      3 levels, 5 bdrms (1 of which should be a guest bedroom, or office space), 3 bath, 4400 sq feet   400 sq foot balcony, 1000 sq foot backyard, 400 sq foot side yard   2 car garage (with extra outdoor parking)   Would be perfect for: any family      When the project is done there should be 4 of each of these types of homes. 16 homes in all. Two neighborhoods, with a community area connecting them. Each home will have a back porch that is properly portioned according to the size of the backyard and house. There are lots of storage spaces in each home. Pets welcome. No moving-in deposit, and no pet fees. The community area will not be open to the public, it will only be open for those who live in either neighborhood and their guests. We want to promote safety by not letting uninvited outsiders inside. The community area will include a  pool (with two small slides and other small attractions), a clubhouse (kind of like a billiard/ballroom type space with wifi access, a snack bar, a meeting room, and restrooms), a playground, a walking trail, and a community garden. A few more things to factor into the monthly cost and desire of living in this space is that the general design of these homes has a very pleasant earthy, old world, eclectic vibe with modern twists. Each house has a few hidden rooms (meaning your laundry room may be hidden behind a door that appears to be nothing more than a typical shelf upon first glance), and the whole design scheme is the perfect combination between whimsical and elegant.       If you could please list how much exactly you would be willing/able to pay monthly for each of the 4 houses listed above-keeping the mind the neighborhood amenities, cost of living in the Denver area, your yearly income, the typical/average cost for those kind of homes in the area, and your personal opinions-that would be great.      I sure do hope I didn't make any typos...      Thanks :]

20090202204215AAjD9bE	Travel;Asia Pacific;Philippines	Can you teach me how to paint?	A blond Pinay, wanting to earn some money, decided to hire herself out as a handyman-type and started canvassing a wealthy neighborhood. She went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had any jobs for her to do. 'Well, you can paint my porch. How much will you charge?'       The blond Pinay said, 'How about pipty dollars?' The man agreed and told her that the paint and ladders that she might need were in the garage.       The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her husband, 'Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house?' The man replied, 'She should. She was standing on the porch.'       A short time later, the blond Pinay came to the door to collect her money. 'You're finished already?' he asked. 'O-o,' the blonde Pinay    answered, 'and I had paint lept ober, so I gabe it two coats.'    Impressed, the man reached in his pocket for the $50.    'And by the way,' the blond added, 'it's not a Porch, it's a Perrari'      =)
20090202204254AADqHjf	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Planning a beach trip..?	my boyfriend and i are planning a beach trip to rehoboth beach in delaware sometime in june. we know what hotel we want, what room, but the only problem is we don't have a date picked to go. we're pretty flexible, mainly any time in june we can pick. bottom line, the rate of the room we want is about double the price mid/late june than it is in the beginning of june.      it would be nice to save half the price a night by going early in june, but what i'm concerned about is that it won't be very warm outside. i know, dumb right? i'm just wondering if anybody knows if there's a huge temperature difference between the first week of june and mid june around that area, because if there is we'll pay the extra bucks for it to be warmer when we go, but if not.. we'd definitely love to save!      help? anybody?
