20090222144256AA3UDOT	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Read any good Op-Ed articles lately?	I have to write a paper analyzing the rhetoric in a recent opinion article. I've been looking at some in the NY Times opinion section, but I haven't found any articles that stand out as interesting, clear, and written with interesting rhetorical strategies. In the past when I've had this assignment I've looked at Maureen Dowd articles since they are usually very sarcastic which is easy to write about, but I don't like her recent article that sort of attacked Obama. Any ideas? Thanks so much!

20090222144555AAP8uXU	News & Events;Current Events	How can I find out if a friend of mine from Australia survived the fires?	I have a friend in Australia. I haven't heard from her in almost 2 weeks. I have no clue if she survived the fires or not. Is there a list of victims names or anything I can use to see if her name is listed somewhere as either safe or deceased? I'm really freaking out as yesterday was my birthday and she wouldn't have missed it for the world. I can't get ahold of her or any of her family and her friend that I did get ahold of hasn't heard from her or her family either. We are all very concerned. I have found a couple video clips with some of the deceased pictured but she was not in any of those. I know there are 209 dead and am afraid her and her family are among them. I also hear that the fires were so hot, some of the bodies were cremated and will probably never be identified. I just need some way of knowing one way or the other if she is okay or not. If anyone can help me out, it would be greatly appreciated.

20090222115442AA4jPdH	News & Events;Current Events	What caused global economic crisis?	It all started when banks lended billions into sub-prime mortgages. That greed drove them into loaning these assets at the expense of the borrower. Big investment firms such as Merrill Linch, Lehman Brothers, etc invested heavily into these sub-prime mortgages. Consequently the mortgages defaulted or became toxic. After banks lost billions the investors lost mostly everything as well and had to be rescued or failed.      Any private citizen or Wall Street trader's assets plunged that invested into these enterprises that invested into these sub-prime mortgages. This gradually sent shockwaves throughout Wall Street until it all finally bottomed out. A domino effect ensued throughout the market causing any corporation to rethink its financial philosophy in these tough times because the markets all around the globe are so binded.    As these coroporations that were too big to fail did, the economy suffered a catastrophic meltdown. Mostly all corporate stocks and small businesses saw their stock take a downward spiral, they saw less income whick prompted them to lay-off employees and manufacture and distribute less of their product or service. When these employees saw their assets fall, their income decreased, or their was job cut, they had less money to spend to stimulate the economy.       Banks now are not lending because they don't have the assets to do so, and are fearful that if they lent more money the same would happen again. They will see less of a profit for many years and don't have the confidence to lend right now, halting the American dream.      The government has taken steps to reassure investors, and get banks to start lending again by establishing measures that will help stimulate the economy. But all this partisan bickering in Washington isn't going to sove the crisis. The only way to solve is to restore confidence in the system and create jobs that will undoubtedly stimulate the economy in any fashion, and the best way to do that is to pour money into it no matter the cost because the effects of doing something is greater than the effects of doing nothing.
