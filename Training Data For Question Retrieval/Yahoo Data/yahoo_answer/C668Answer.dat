If it is meant to be and you make it together that long, then yes your relationship might spice up.  However, young relationships can run their course and dry up.  So just focus on and enjoy your relationship now.<br>  <br>  PS -Typically teen relationships break up before they move in together or shortly there after.

How will you support yourselves, pay the bills, buy clothes and household goods + the expense of running a car?<br>  What if you want to go on a holiday, can you afford that?<br>  <br>  Maybe go on a holiday together and see how you go. Hire a cabin someowhere for a couple of weeks where you have to do all of your own cooking, washing and everything as a test run.
btPeBsJpaa	Well....depends. If he's shy, he'd definitely feel more open alone with you.<br>  <br>  If he's popular/open/loud/, then he'd probably feel fine in a group.<br>  <br>  I would talk to him and be with him alone. :)|`|UtXBBEuqaa	Sometimes when he is with friends he may kinda blow her off cuz he doesn't want his friends to tease him.  He'll pry act better when he is alone with the girl he will pry be more open.

cIBqQ0QEaa	First, I have to say I am so touched that you're going to stay this way until you're married. With that said, there are emotions that you will come to find through this. They are not bad emotions, but very good ones. Keep in mind it can be uncomfortable the first time, so don't base anything on your first time together. Afterwards, you'll feel closer to him and it will be something you look forward to. Not just because it feels good, which it does, but because it brings the two of you closer together. Best of luck and everything about it will be wonderful!|`|B359bLqsaa	I read something once that made alot of sense to me.  Women give sex in order to get love.  Men give love in order to get sex.  To me this means that women expect to get love and men expect to give love, and everyone is happy.  So, the emotional impact for you is that you will totally give your heart and your body to this man.... and you will not regret anything.

Stepping out on that limb is a great, freeing and terrifying experience, but it's one that has tremendous power (look at what people have done throughout history over love).  Be in love with the idea of love and be proud that you can have these feelings.  Don't stop reaching for love.  Sure, you can get your heart broken, but not always, and those good experiences will be so worth it.  So, play some downtempo for a while, eat some chocolate, and just bide your time until the next person catches your eye and makes the back of your neck tingle.

8ee4GpfRaa	You can have this guy. <br>  Trust me. <br>  <br>  Firstly, It's great that you are smiley around him, he will see that and think that you are a fun and happy person. <br>  <br>  Secondly, SINCE you are so nervous around him, I would suggest to be around him for awhile without talking. You have to become friends with someone that he hangs out with. If you already are friends with someone he is friends with, go up to THAT person when they are together. Start chatting with them, be bubbly and and fun. Talk about a subject that he might feel inclined to comment about. <br>            Maybe he will say something, maybe not. <br>  You don't have to stand there and ignore him then, make yourself seem open and chill. <br>         While you are talking to the other person, say something about math class to him, so he doesn't interpret your nervousness to you being snobby or bitchy. (Guys are insecure, too, and might think that if you don't talk to them it's because you don't like him) you could say...<br>  "Do you like your new seat in math?" or "How'd you do on that last math test?" It can be whatever you want, but you will feel less nervous if it is something simple like that. <br>            If you have never been formally introduced you can say "by the way I am _____, you're ____ right?"<br>  Of course you have to show that you know who he, since he would know that it is bs otherwise.<br>   <br>  This part is most important! Ok, after he says his answer to your simple question, you don't really have to say anything back. Remember, people love to talk about themselves, and people who are sweet but don't talk too much about themselves are a mystery. <br>  <br>  Mysterious is good. <br>  So after that you can say "ok, well i have to go do some homework, talk to you guys later"  You walk away (first, SHORT BUT SWEET) <br>  <br>  confidently and VOILA, <br>  next time you see him you can say hello and start chatting it up.<br>  It will get easier everytime you see him.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Is it the same, that he is upset that in the evenings you don't want to go party ? <br>  The most of your time you will not be spending on vacation, but at home. <br>  If one is a party animal and the other is a home boy(girl) it will lead to conflict, if there are no compromises made.<br>  Often we also expect a lot more from our vacation time - and it is normally far from perfect.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I guess you both just have different ideas about what makes a holiday fun. Maybe next time before you go away together you should have a chat about what you are excited about and what things you each want to do. That way everyone is clear about intentions and what they want to get out of the holiday. I do think though that both of you need to make a little effort to help each other out. For example, you make a little effort with the nightlife part, while he makes a little more effort to enjoy the parts of the holiday that you are excited about.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Is this Ali?|`|LVlS4y7Caa	I would be concerned if my honey and I didn't have fun together in such a place as Cancun!  You two need to work out activities and patterns together - learn that you can do things alone on a vacation AND together - everything doesn't have to be quite in sync, you just have to lay your ground rules ahead of time, now that you realize there is a problelm between you traveling.  If he wants to stay out at night, keep it a reasonable hour like midnight and if he wants to stay later alone, let him have his space and HE needs to let you have your space as well.  It goes "hand in hand" with mutual respect in a loving relationship!  Compromise...<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|ehAG30Yvaa	I love Cancun! My husband & I went there on our honeymoon :)<br>  <br>  As far as your questions goes, I guess it's up to you to decide how much this problem will affect your relationship. Does he go clubbing a lot when you're home or did he just want to take advantage of being on vacation and checking out the club scene? I think he should be a little more understanding of the fact that you weren't totally into it but you also need to try and be a little flexible and just go with the flow. If he wants to go stand around at a club then go stand next to him and try to enjoy it. It's probably not worth fighting over and I don't think will ultimately make or break your relationship. <br>  <br>  My husband and I are young but when we went to Cancun we never set foot inside of a club and we we're both perfectly fine with it. But if he would have wanted to go I would have happily gone with just for the experience. Vacations are about doing new things and seeing places you don't get to experience at home. If he's an avid clubber at home, this should be no surprise...but if he's not I'm sure he just wanted to check out the party scene since it's supposed to be pretty awesome there. No big deal, maybe just discuss it next time you go somewhere so you're prepared beforehand in case he wants to "party".|`|5kIUmkz8aa	Sounds like you guys do have some fun times together while on vacation, so just enjoy those times even more.  We all have our differences on what "fun" is for a vacation and can't always be eye-to-eye with things and that's okay, just enjoy the good times together while there.  And yes we have "trouble" traveling together at times but we have worked it out, we allow ourselves a few hours (or a day) out of our vacation together to doing what the other person likes to do and then we trade/switch.  Yeah it may be boring at times for the other person but that's only for a few hours (or a day) out of our vacation and not the entire time.   p.s.

And yes, I can take them apart and put them back together.|`|gFwD0yeCaa	my ex husband got me one when he was deployed. i had it for about 2 months, but never got it saudered. One of my friends took it apart thinking she could put it back together. Never did and it wound up getting lost in one of our overseas moves.|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	consigned to the "junk" drawer with the rubik cube<br>  enjoy the day|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	No never.
AA10056605	First, I need to say there is absolutely nothing wrong with you, nor with your husband.<br>  <br>  Your desire for a little aggression (even a little domination) is completely natural. And I know this from personal experience.<br>  <br>  My partner and I have been together almost 10 years, and he admitted to me that he got really turned on by me being more aggressive. I am, by nature, more like your husband, so this admission came as a bit of a shock. <br>  <br>  But, he and I talked it over, and he explained everything to me, and the more he explained the more I realized what he was asking for. Since that discussion, our sex life has been complete fireworks! Utterly spectacular!<br>  <br>  So, my advice is to sit down with your husband, and talk this over at length. Explain to him what your desires are, ask him what his are. And experiment with those desires, both yours and his.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, and let him know, that sex should never be a taboo subject in a marriage/partnership. It's not the most important aspect of your relationship, but it is important.|`|ENSGrZAqaa	I dont think there is anything wrong with it in general, what I think is wrong is doing that to your husband for kicks because its a turn on for you. Its good you told him so now maybe you guys can have play fights, get the same effect without hurting your marriage.|`|os36Q3P2aa	I have no suggestions .BUT .<br>  I just had to post  coz i just LOVE the way you put that last bit '' i found out how sexy he was while angry about 8months ago and have been pissing him off regularly ever since '' LMAO that really made me laugh !!!|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	I wish my sweet wife would put the effort in to turning me on|`|PVsKQAVEaa	funny but iam a guy and i performe at a harder and longer level when iam pissed off so it works for me :D|`|3f3A57eDaa	you aren't syco at all. I mean some people like when people are angry... What you should do is apologize and tell him why you do it. If i ruin it for you guys then PLEASE don't be mad. I just want you guys to be happy . the other thing you could do is try not to do it and find some other way to make you feel turned on! good luck|`|AA10353286	Why don't you just have rough sex where he is the aggressor? I don't like to see my husband angry because he is a yelling madman. I do know what you mean though. Some men are incredibly hot when they're hot. Nonetheless, provoking him to anger is likely breaking down trust and love in your relationship, so in short, it's not cute.<br>  <br>  Maybe he could pretend to be angry at you, if he's a good actor, it'll work. I appreciate being totally dominated in bed by my man, mainly because I am actually more sexually agressive than my husband. Do some role playing or something.|`|LvTIVjySaa	You like it when your man acts like an Alpha Male...hate to say it, but that's really a very normal, and primitive emotion. All womankind started out the same way, looking for a strong mate who could protect them, shelter them, and provide for them.  Your husband is a mild mannered man, but when he reverts to an aggressive or possessive individual, it creates a spark in you.  You like him to be dominant from time to time, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that idea or you.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to be submissive.  Maybe you need to stop trying to manipulate him into fights, and start showing him that being dominant in the bedroom is a real turn on for you.  Be blunt.  Men can't read minds, so just sit the man down and tell him what he can do to make you wild with passion.  Nothing wrong with a little forceful play, so long as it done to a level that both of you find exciting and not beyond your personal boundaries.  Enjoy!|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	To each his own who am I to judge what makes you tick in bed.|`|94b8KImYaa	I think I get the picture. <br>  I would talk to him again - when you have time, when both have made time for that - and ask him what he thinks about what you admitted and how he feels. <br>  That you don't really want him to be upset, but like how he reacts sexually when he is. <br>  Suggesting role play. The emphasis is on play......<br>  <br>  And before all that apologize to make him so angry and to hurt his feelings.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I agree with the second response. If you continue to make him angry, eventually he will grow tired of it, and divorce you for someone who can treat him better.<br>  <br>  You could try domination instead of making him upset. Allow him to be in complete control in the bed room.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	This desire is very common.  Women are attracted to aggression and sometimes violence.  Is there a way he can learn to go into "Alpha dominance" mode on his own without you having to push him into the red zone?|`|AXbdNdPzaa	LMAO  Too funny.  Poor guy.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	Get some counseling.  This isn't healthy for either of you.  And certainly not fair to him at all.<br>  Red|`|gAOAdOHraa	I understand why you do it as I'm sure a lot of women get turned on by this.  However its different when it is a genuine fight and you have good makeup sex.  If you are going out of your way to make him angry and cause fights in your relationship if you don't be careful you may have no relationship. I don't think you need psychiatric help, but I do think that you would benefit by a few sessions with a marriage councillor to help sort your problems out.|`|lyWSufFBaa	I seriously don't think you are crazy but you may want to stop pissing him off ever chance you get.  Just tell him you don't want to make love, you want him to be aggressive and rough!!  It's not the anger that turns you on it's the aggression.  Tell him you want a bad boy every now and then lol.  Whatever you do stop pissing him off because you might come home one day and he won't be there.|`|1f333cc1fc67ffacc60cc00afcd82a36aa	I feel the same way.

I am hopeful you will speak to an expert, a counselor who deals with intimacy issues.  Just go once or twice and see if it doesn't help you sort out your feelings of desired against instigating a dangerous situation that could really do more harm than good.<br>  <br>  I really do applaud your honesty with him - I do BUT, temper it with "I wish I wasn't this way and am working on it and am TRULY sorry if it upsets or hurts you".  My sense is, he could use a little help in staging romance with you, you know, pushing the right buttons.  This is different for each and every person, men and women alike, but I do agree its important and can be dealt with.  He also might benefit from some intimacy counseling, but perhaps what you learn you can teach him? <men are such babies about outside advice on sex><br>  <br>  But please, cease and desist with the pissing him off in favor of ultra sexy lingerie, maybe even a handcuff act, whatever you two find that works for you.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|VSVQHKwKaa	I think the only sick thing about this senario is that you didn't fess up right away.<br>  <br>  Look, what you feel is not necessarily wrong. But your method is. <br>  <br>  He's been through eight months of hell from you. Now you'll have to wait to see if he forgives you. That's the price you're going to have to pay. <br>  <br>  BTW...there are more healthy methods of playing through your fantasy.<br>  <br>  Either you like getting into trouble and getting out of it (it's a thrill), or you like your husband being more aggressive with you in generally.<br>  <br>  I think it's more the latter than the former, given your comment about how "passive" he is normally.<br>  <br>  So work on growing that. Rather than causing him to be angry, build him into a man who takes a firm hand in bed. Encourage him to be dominating. Encourage him to be aggressive and manly. <br>  <br>  And stop trying to convince yourself that the fantasy is a big deal. It isn't. In fact, most women agree that an aggressive male is a turn on. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|qH3pVH7Paa	lol i can relate i think but not in the sexual way<br>  my husband is so calm mind am total opposite to him<br>  hes laid back easy going and thinks before he speaks<br>  unlike me of course<br>  i really like to see how 'far' i can stretch him too hehe<br>  he gets ticked off with me far more easily now than he did before<br>  i think i over did it<br>  oops :(<br>  but it is fun haha
Gsfp1tEEaa	Simply tell him why u feel it would not be right for him to bring his girlfriend. It's your wedding and your in control of who comes. It would not be rude if u told him not to bring her but it would be rude for him to argue.<br>  <br>  Also, be sure to seat them apart from each other at the Reception|`|l5Q8lq35aa	I think it would be a bit rude to ask him not to bring his partner. To avoid<br>  this, change the card a bit; at the bottom you could write something<br>  like, "To all who are invited: this is a private wedding. Therefore, we<br>  have a invited a strict amount of people who are close to us. Please<br>  try not to bring others we are unfamiliar with, children included." or<br>  something along those lines. Make it very broad, as if he isn't the<br>  only one.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	There is no rule that a person has to get a plus 1 at a wedding. However, if she is his girlfriend for a while and they are serious, then it would be sort of rude to invite him without her.|`|AA11312653	You invite everyone by name. To send "&guest" or "&family" invitations usually brings its own punishment. Isn't that kind of no-brainer where a free champagne supper is concerned?<br>  <br>  If you invite someone who is part of an established couple, then you must also invite that someones partner. This fellow and his paramour are not an established couple. You invite each member of the couple by name, to attend as a single. I strongly favor using RSVP by phone (instead of those costly little cards) so that in case of misunderstandings it can be made perfectly clear that ONLY the person(s) named in the invitation are invited. (No, you don't take & make all these calls yourself. You put your groomsmen and bridesmaids to work.)|`|FnskUYpqaa	I think you should tell him in person. "I think it's best if you don't bring so and so I want everyone to enjoy themselves and wouldn't want anyone to feel uncomfortable". It's your wedding and your right to pick whoever you want there and whoever you don't want there.|`|29I8PWrxaa	I would just invite each of them and not dates.  If they aren't married or engaged, you really aren't required to allow them a guest anyway.  Just skip the "plus one" on the invite so you can avoid the whole drama.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Leave out the "plus one" for both of them and make sure they are placed on separate sides of the reception. That's about all you can do. When he RSVPs make it clear to him that he isn't not allowed to bring a guest.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	If it is only his name on the invite then it means he is the only one invited, not his GF. So it would be rude of him to bring her if she is not listed as a guest.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	You have every right to invite, or not, whoever you want.  If this guy has any sense at all, he'll understand why bringing the other woman is a bad idea.  In fact, given the circumstances, he shouldn't even have to be told.  But don't be afraid to tell him.  And if he has a problem with it, tell him you'll understand if he doesn't want to come either.  <br>  It's your day.  You call all the shots.|`|ZfleGhXLaa	You can tell him he may not bring a guest, or that he may bring a guest.  If you do let him bring a guest it is an etiquette breech to specify who he can and can not take, it would be his choice.  So my suggestion would be to leave the "And guest" off of his specific invite, and if he asks any questions say you are very sorry but, due to costs and keeping numbers down it isn't possible to allow everyone to bring a guest.  You can very honestly tell him that when you started planning your wedding you wedding you were planning to invite he and his ex as a couple.  Tell him that because of this you just didn't plan to accommodate an extra guest, and with the current economy money is tighter than it might have been (that's a language everyone understands, and avoids being rude, and drama.)<br>  <br>  That said, be sure to seat the exs at separate tables.  They may both be your friends, but he cheated on her so even without his new girlfriend their may be some awkwardness between them.|`|tyl9aSu9aa	Maybe I'm the only one here who thinks it, but I do think it's kinda rude, especially given they've technically been together for about a year (even if the circumstances are kind skeezy).<br>  <br>  Granted: I understand completely where you're coming from. You don't respect what he did (who would?), and you certainly don't want a big blow up on your wedding day. Who would want to invite the kind of drama this situation could incite? Not me. On the other hand, I kinda figure I'm going to elope, so I'll be saved this kind of trouble.<br>  <br>  I think the only way around it (and it's still a method Miss Manners might not like, but who cares?) is to simply invite each of them without a guest and seat them at tables across the room from one another.<br>  <br>  He may still be miffed if you don't invite his new girlfriend, but at that point you can always beg off with the whole, "We were going to invite you and Betsy together, but now that you're with Candy, we simply don't have the space, and the count has already been set."<br>  <br>  If he doesn't come because of that, that's something you and your fiance will have to live with, but it will certainly help you avoid drama on your wedding day.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	no because it is YOUR WEDDING day, drama is the worst WORST and we all know that in that situation if you invited his now girlfriend, it would just cause major tension. PLUS you dont even know his new girlfriend or not well atleast, so it would be respectful if he did not bring his new girlfriend. and he SHOULD be very understandable to why you made that decision. <br>  to not be rude goin about it: just say TO _______(his name) and not include hers, so that he takes the hint that the invitation is only for him.<br>  DRAMA=CRAPPY DAY and WEDDING should = best day of ur life<br>  dont let it spoil just from a bunch of drama :) wish you all the best|`|swTjhCznaa	oh boy.  drama drama drama.  <br>  <br>  What I would do:  kindly ask the guy not to bring his new girlfriend to avoid drama on your big day.  it's about you.  not the groom, not your friends... you.  I would hope he will understand.<br>  <br>  update:  I would not put this in the invitation.  Call him and ask him to not bring her and explain why.  Putting it in the invite is tacky and omitting her name or a "plus 1" could be confusing and he might bring her having misunderstood.|`|v3MqaYJIaa	i don't think it would if that's the case but other than that it would be but its your big day so you shouldn't put up with any drama<br>  <br>  i personaly would not invaite anyone that i know might couse drama on my weding day <br>  <br>  but i'm not planing on geting married so i dont really care|`|ownoc1ZJaa	I would simply address this by only inviting him on the invitation - that way he knows clearly that he can't bring a guest.  I wouldn't say anything more then that, chances are if he knows his ex is going to be there, he'll probably decline going anyway.|`|vCZuh3oDaa	Your question is how do I make sure someone doesn't come to the wedding?  The answer is... you don't invite them.<br>  <br>  On the outside of the invitation envelope, you write his name only.|`|PytiHWE5aa	no it is your day and no one should ruin that day for you if it was me i would less drama that way for you and less stress also|`|XXBKCt9xaa	do what you want! <br>  just tell the person not to bring anyone because of the length of the guest list.<br>  that's what i always do :)|`|QQgftTxxaa	It's your wedding day, do what you have to do to make it exactly the way you want it.|`|1fc3673510203595378a0fcae2d7735baa	Well, yes it is rude. But, I stress you don't want any other people comming.|`|oW4wjOw2aa	it's YOUR DAY. What ever makes the bride relaxed and happy.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	We have the exact same situation.  However, we just decided that to avoid drama, we would just invite one of them.  We went with the girl - the guy had been cheating on her and we thought is was a pretty rotten thing to do.  Rather than have two people there that will most likely be uncomfortable and avoiding each other all night, we just decided that one who can relax and enjoy themselves would be best.  We also thought that the guy would take not being invited a lot less personally than the girl.  Just try to think of it like this- in a couple of years, do you think that you will be close to both of them equally?  Or after the break up has settled in, do you think you'll probably become closer to one than the other?   You don't have to do what I did- I just wanted to give you another option!<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide- good luck!|`|VRdxwKaQaa	It's not the coolest thing a person could do, but neither is a guest bringing unwanted and unnecessary drama to your wedding. You seem to have legitimate reasons to not have the new girlfriend there, and I think a good friend would understand and respect your request. I have a similar situation in that a very good friend sometimes dates a psycho woman whom he routinely gets into huge nasty fights with, especially when they drink. I have told him that he cannot bring this woman. He knows they are toxic together and understands my request.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Don't say "she's not welcome."<br>  <br>  Simply address the invitation to HIM only  Don't put "and guest" on it.<br>  <br>  If he is rude and clueless enough to RSV for himself Plus 1,  tell him that you are, sadly, unable to accommodate anyone other than invited guests at your wedding "due to space/financial limitations."<br>  <br>  Then figure out what you're going to do if the clod shows up at your wedding with the hussy anyway.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	I would tell him just like you said here and then give him the choice to come without her or not come at all.  Explain to him in person and let him know that it's for the sake of the ex and her feelings. I think there is nothing wrong with that.  But remember if they stay together and you want to stay friends, you may have to accept her.  But this is your wedding you don't have to accept her now.<br>  Red
PKRZtwyHaa	u call this easy<br>  helping you with your problem<br>  <br>  anyway y cant u work up to kissing him<br>  think about it then do it cuz there is no reason|`|AA11263103	*Wait for the right moment.*<br>  There’s usually no hurry for a kiss, especially a first kiss with someone, so be patient and wait until the mood is right. Some good times are at a romantic movie after or during an on screen kiss, walking in the moonlight, or during a particularly intimate conversation. Wait until the two of you are alone so that the other person will feel more comfortable and so that nobody will see if your attempt to kiss is rejected. Many girls (and guys) don't want to be asked: they prefer that you be confident enough to take a risk and just go for it. One way to do so is to stop whatever you’re doing and silently look into the person’s eyes for a moment or two. Touch their face, then gently pull him/her toward you for a kiss. If the person pulls away or hesitates at any time, he or she is not ready for a kiss. If this happens, tell them that you want to give them a hug and go for that.<br>  <br>  *Approach for the kiss.*<br>  Approach slowly and smoothly. Depending on your starting position you may need only to turn your head, or you may need to lean in a bit. You may want to use your hands to gently urge your partner’s body or head into position—you just want to guide his or her movement a little, you don’t want to forcibly move any part of his or her body or hold your partner in an uncomfortable position—but in general you just want to position yourself correctly and let your partner meet you. As you near your partner’s lips, maintain eye contact. You may want to close your eyes after your lips meet to heighten the sensuality of the kiss (and to avoid staring at the pores on his or her face).<br>  <br>  *Kiss gently.*<br>  There are many kinds of kisses, from quick pecks to sweet, passionate kisses. There’s a time and place for all of these, but your first kiss with someone should be gentle and romantic. Don’t press your mouth onto your partner’s--just let your lips meet--and don’t try to push your tongue into his or her mouth. When your lips meet, pucker them and give a kiss, then smile and pull away a little, keeping your head close to your partner’s. If your partner moves to kiss you back or seems to like it and doesn’t pull away, go in for another kiss, this one a little firmer and longer. Put your hands on their face or around their shoulders.<br>  <br>  *Make the kiss the reason for the kiss.* <br>  Some people seem to treat kisses as nothing more than a prelude to something else, and will try to quickly move into French kissing. Good kissers concentrate on the kiss, and they kiss, at least seemingly, expecting nothing more. Enjoy the experience, and don’t move too fast. Live in the moment. You will not kiss as well if your mind is somewhere else. For example, when kissing, try to avoid thoughts like "What is he/she thinking about?", "Do I look good tonight?", or anything else. Don't be too self-conscious, or have ANY thoughts outside the kiss if you can help it. Instead, concentrate on the way the other person's lips feel against yours.|`|Zu7GJeU4aa	Plactise on a friend or your hand|`|Cdp02p0Xaa	do what you feel is rite.|`|GHd84xipaa	make sure both of you brush your teeth and go for it.|`|b6QzfsMUaa	Why not??????<br>  Just do it it will feel right promise.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	then just stay away from him is your best bet|`|YlyN73Jnaa	When you two are alone at a private time, ask him if he's comfortable with you kissing him, and if he is, pucker up your lips.

Well if you can't kiss him yet don't rush it hunny. If you both really care for each other it will just happen. Try to hang out just you two instead of in a group so it won't be really awkward.

AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|AA11353473	He's probably interested.<br>  Try talking to him more, and see where things go.<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Apv0QmDWUcHo1iwJvWTHLQjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304152842AAjiLa3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
zzaScg0haa	At the time frame your relationship is in your honeymoon phase probbaly is ending, but given the details you gave I have no idea what is going on in your relationship
jVBW9xy5aa	Talk to him more often. Give it some time then ask the big question when you feel it's ready. Be straight forward when doing this.|`|3UlGbeDBaa	Yup, do the note.  Pretty much include the basics on the note that you've said here.  You know you're not best friends and hope he doesn't think that odd but you do find him attractive and extend an invite.  Do include that if he prefers not to accept, you understand and thank him for considering.  But also include a form of contact if he should like to go with you ...<br>  Go for it !!!!  I would!!!!|`|wy5SiCS2aa	just pass him a note in the hallway that says, hey I know you were in my math class last year (whatever class it was) and I always meant to talk to you but didn't get the chance, would you like to go to the dance with me-I'd like to get to know you. <br>  <br>  or something like that.|`|8l4y6gxlaa	If I were you I would just get your guts together, not even think about it and just ask him out. Trust me you will regret it especially if another girl gets to him before you. You can do it. He will think you are a strong powerful woman to ask him to the dance. Good Luck! Hope it goes well.<br>  Have faith in yourself<br>  Yes I know it is easier said then done but you can do it|`|aj6RBseGaa	if you get a chance to talk to him while his friends arent around why not ask him?<br>  <br>  and no its not weird :)|`|fwLpotDNaa	Um, okay, first things first, you need to talk to the boy! If you just ask someone you don't talk to to the dance, then how awkward would the dance be? If someone i didn't know asked me to the dance, i would probably say no. (just being honest). <br>  <br>  So i think you should first get the nerve to go talk to him. Become his friend. There will be plenty of other dances in the future, so you don't have to go with him to this one. Just go and talk to him. Find a common interest. Ask him what classes/teachers he has etc etc. And who knows, if you get to be good enough friends, he may be expecting you ask him to the dance!!<br>  Best of luck!|`|VvEY0qQtaa	No its not wierd to ask somebody that you don't talk too. If you do that, then he will immediately understand that it means that you like him and will not think badly of you for it at all. Only girls think that something like this would be weird, guys though, would enjoy the random ego-boost lol. Good luck.|`|ZILhRhexaa	be brave and ask. look at it this way, if u don't, then u aren't gonna go to the dance with him. if u do, u might. so try to strike up a conversation or two before u really take the leap and then ask within a week (at least) of the dance. be friendly about it. if he doesnt fell presured it will help. good luck|`|2mEqZ2GQaa	I would go up and ask him why he never got on facebook. That's a start... and don't worry about being nervous. guys are normally flattered if a girl is nervous around them. <br>  don't stress about it. that's the last thing you wanna do.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|jvjziDGeaa	If you are afraid of asking him. Write in a note and stuff it in his locker. Do it before it's to late.|`|66889e89cda0389b30905daa69738d96aa	Aww, wow..i hope everything works out:-)<br>  <br>  Step1<br>  Pick your guy. It may be someone you have had your eye on for a long time or a spur of the moment choice because the dance is approaching and you need a date. Whatever the case, just make sure it’s a guy who does not already have a date for the dance, is not dating anyone you know or a guy whom you are sure hates your guts and would turn you down.<br>  Step2<br>  Be friendly. Once you’ve targeted the guy you want to ask to the dance, start seeking him out and saying hello to him. Start breaking the ice with friendly, non-intrusive conversation. Try to start the banter at least a few days before you plan to ask him to the dance.<br>  Step3<br>  Drop hints. During one of your friendly conversations, ask if he’s going to the school dance and if he has a date. Dropping hints might also open up the door enough for him to ask you to the dance while you two are talking. Lead into the big question. Once you guys are smiling regularly at each other in the hall, tell him you need to ask him something. This prepares him for what’s coming, unless he’s a total dunce and doesn’t get any kind of hint.<br>  Step4<br>  Ask away. Once you have his full attention, far away from his friends, your friends or other eavesdroppers, ask him in a casual but direct way. “You seem like such a nice guy. I was hoping we could go to the school dance together. Are you game?” If that is still too forward, perhaps you can try something such as, “Hey, I want to go to the dance with a friend. Would you be that friend who comes with me?” That way you steer clear of any scary commitment. If it turns out that he already has a date, tell him you are disappointed because you would have liked to have gone with him. Now you can ask if he has any friends who need a date.|`|os7END95aa	start talking to him more often, dont wait to long becasue they might already be taken as it gets closer.
mFZeEm9paa	Funny, I have the opposite problem. My guy basically uses no tounge at all....Wanna trade? JK|`|3zaradzMaa	Just say 'like this' and then lead by example. Then he'll just go with it and assume that this is how you prefer it.|`|yelqyRLIaa	well you can not use so much tongue and maybe he will get the picture<br>  if not you might have to tell him|`|qqi2YlABaa	when he uses to much tongue just immediately stop participating|`|xQ6P4bVEaa	just tell him where you would really like that tongue|`|FEStjFIRaa	use yours tooo!!!|`|e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	You just have to tell him. You can tell him in a subtle way. If his kiss is that harsh, I am sure you have already tried to pull back or not open your mouth as much. <br>  <br>  The key to making him not feel odd about is to do it when the two of you are not kissing and make sure you are not telling him about it when it is time to make out. Just ask him was he really excited the last time you two made out and he will surely ask you why. Tell him that he seemed really into it was using a little too much tongue. Then tell him that you love it when he kisses you, especially when its soft and with not as much tongue.|`|ZILhRhexaa	as he starts to use too much, put your hand on his face and pull back a centimeter or two so your lips are still touching but his tounge is barley in ur mouth anymore. then start  slowly again and do this everytime he starts to use to much. it will show him u dont like to be suffocated by his saliva...|`|lEjlN64iaa	keep your lips closed more. like don't open your mouth as wide, and he'll get the picture.|`|1fc3673510203595378a0fcae2d7735baa	PULL BACK A BIT|`|flbQS3ZSaa	suck it

qW5PqMepaa	My husband does this to me sometimes and i always say "I am!" and leave it at that. I don't think he wants to do anything with them I think maybe he just thinks they are pretty or whatever. A lot of guys don't think before they say things, and they don't mean for them to sound the way they do. If you're not bisexual, your answer is simply none of them. If he can't understand that then he isn't making sense. Maybe you could ask him about it - confront him before he asks you again.<br>  Men are strange creatures;)|`|rdcUOa1zaa	its nothing i promise. hes just trying to get a mental pic of u and some hot chick making out and doing the nasty because all guys like some girl on girl action. i dont see whats so hot about it but whatev. boys are weird. but u have nothing to worry about.|`|GDPUGcmRaa	maybe he wants your opinion but that's really weird.he could be wondering if you're bisexual.|`|fOK3tPRVaa	say who do u think it is and hope he says u <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304155139AAfqaCy">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|njz5XFG2aa	He may just be curious or maybe he's just messing around and thinks its funny.|`|UGQt96UKaa	i think you should break upp with him or whenever he says crap like that just be like..."i think i would totally hook up/make out with myself!!!!!" hahaha (in a joking way of course!!!) ;]|`|kGO4ZhtQaa	i agree with john s, just say 'i am'<br>  <br>  and btw ur bf sounds very insensitive.|`|btVNM1Djaa	the correct response is to ask him who he thinks is the hottest girl in the class is. If he doesn't answer -"you", dump his @ss|`|aAZaqTpEaa	Well i guess, every guy has things that turns him on. To each his own i guess. Personally, i find that a tad strange but whatever. I have heard many guys say that lesbians and girls kissing isn't a turn on for them...but i guess it is for your boyfriend. If it makes you uncomfortable, ask him why he wants to know. And you have a right not to answer, or to tell him to stop asking you. You should not have to feel uncomfortable in a relationship.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	Just because we don't find the gf the most attractive in the settings we are in doesn't mean how we feel towards you. I love my gf but she is no model. Certain things are awesome and different than other girls I have seen.<br>  <br>  Heck me and my gf look at other women together. It is fun. Some of them look super hott but would not ever want to be with them in a relationship and some not even in bed because of the super annoying behaviours. <br>  <br>  He isn't insecure because otherwise he would be up your *** saying you are the most beautiful girl when nobody is the most beautiful or best looking. He just wanted to do something with his gf and see how secure you were with yourself and the relationship.<br>  <br>  Give him a break and play his game already. Try asking him who he thinks is the best looking guy. I can't ever gauge that crap but for some it may make them feel bad and some wouldn't.<br>  <br>  Both genders always look even if they say they don't.|`|a9L5Wj3maa	Tell him i dunno who do YOU think is the hottest guy in class? Or ask him who does he think has a bigger dick than him in school. That should put him in your shoes and make him think twice about the next time he wants to ask you a stupid question.|`|b7vdkAAIaa	dump the ********<br>  <br>  or if he says "who do you think is hottest in your class" say "I am"

NEDLacboaa	The reality of it is.... it isn't so cool. The popular clique is just a group of friends like the geeks or the jocks or the theater group. Popularity is as great. Sure they get the guys and have pretty friends but they don't realize that they're popular. The key to "popularity" is making your own friends, even if they're not in what you consider to be in the popular group. Friends = popularity. But the popular group is not POPULARITY. Just make your own friends and get close and make your own popular group. And if your not in high school already... popularity is nothing in high school... just having friends is good enough|`|oYF3nIbsaa	Hey! HEY! Im popular but im the friendly kind dont worry lol!

But I take it you're talking about the not nice ones haha... soo...<br>  <br>  Anyway, the "popular" girls at my (old) school, are the typical hollister wearing giggling with the boys pretending (or really being) stupid with everyone and trying to act all cute when really it's annoying as hell. Just think to yourself, why would you want to be like someone like that? Why would you want to dress in expensive uncomfortable ugly clothes? Why would you want to look like some stupid bimbo? Why would you want to be all those things those girls are? You don't.<br>  <br>  Just remember that the word "popular" isn't all it's cracked up to be. Being happy and being yourself is the real ticket to happiness.
jUg1OLkNaa	You can put a sing around her house (a BIG ONE) tha says _______ i love you. If you dont beleive me I can get a bigger sign.<br>  <br>  Or you can simply paste a post-it somewhere you know she'll see it and write: I love you WAY more that I'm gonna let you win.|`|GP1YfhKEaa	my best friend and i get in i love you more fights all the time! lol, but we just end up saying that we .ove eachother equally haha|`|XK0sOxbzaa	more then infinity and write out all the digits of pie that you can. ( u know, 3.14159...)|`|mwIbGw9saa	Get a bunch of rose pedals and set them up on your bed to say, "______, I love you more."|`|IOd2NnqQaa	Be like fine... you love me more. I love you so much more than you love me that if you want to think you love me more than so be it!|`|HNEk9pwFaa	write her a note telling her how much she means to u and tell her that u love her more at the end
N5VczAGEaa	you should both be less angry|`|ggfE4rlvaa	He's ******* her for sure. Flipping out is a sign of defensive guilt. Get out while you can. You were being a little attitudey though.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	it seems like that you all are very immaure|`|LzJJn1m7aa	you said things in a disrespectful way for ex: IF YOU is always a disrespectful start to a converstion it sounds confrontational that is why he thouhgt you were mad...ya now he wants nothing to do with you i guarantee.|`|84b2777cc69c41b43d99c853cd3c3469aa	Too much drama on both parts. So if you don't want to talk to him again then why are you worried about it? Just move on.|`|06O8FaOjaa	SOOO YUR POINT IS??????|`|65ojSBXgaa	Well my theory is that when you said "whatever....we need to talk" he took it the wrong way. I dont know what is going on but it sounds like some one got him upset already and he is taking out on you...maybe it was brandy? I'm not sure but one thing I know is that if you know he has been to his ex's house then why be with him. Apparently he isnt over her yet and I believe you are getting in their way and thats what is causing him to blow up because he is not sure on what to do. you are right he is playing with you I dont think he likes you because if he did he wouldnt be acting like that. But you know your relationship better if I were you I would leave him for someone else because he sounds like a total douche bag you deserve someone for you and only you. Dont be the third wheeler that aint cool.<br>  <br>  Take care,<br>  Gail Friend|`|rB1bJAdtaa	Good Job(:<br>  Girls need to stand up for themselves better.<br>  I'm proud.<br>  You should probably get out of that position as fast as possible.<br>  It doesn't sound good.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|mdOocxZ2aa	Guys misread girls all the time. he's probubly just confused. give him a break.|`|Rsrg0Ag6aa	the things u said sounded bitchy.<br>  u guys sounds kinda immature. no offense.|`|UDGBrOqaaa	Kids........................)|`|2kpZzg93aa	Girl you don't deserve that. If any guy treats you like s*** and talks to you that kind of way, you don't need him. There are so many options other than him. And don't stress yourself because you shouldn't be stressing over some guy that wants to be with his ex girlfriend. Tell him to f*** off.|`|94ebb57af408d5afba386cb850f40d9eaa	He told you what you did, you have chosen to ignore it.  It doesn't matter if what he accused you of is true or not.  It only matters that HE thinks so.   So:  Clearly, he is either going on the defensive because he KNOWS he's done wrong and doesn't want to deal with it, OR  you actually DO get mad at him far too easily w/out justification.<br>  IMO, judging by what He wrote, and by what YOU wrote in response, you are both simpy too immature to be in a relationship with each other.  (I don't mean that in any cruel or disrespectful way)<br>  As for what to do:  Do NOTHING.  Don't call, Don't go over.  NOTHING.|`|rdcUOa1zaa	him blowing up like that shows that hes prolly hookin up with brandy all the time.<br>  when a guy is cheating on u they will always be like really defensive and jump to so many conclusions about anyting u say. like u cld be like "what do u want for dinner?" and he could be like "WOAH! WTF?! WHATS WITHTHE 3RD DEGREE? QUIT INTERROGATING ME!!!"<br>  <br>  lol a guys never sed that to me bfor but its just an example lol.|`|ZLQoVcY0aa	First guys hate it when you say WHATEVER. and secondly he sounds like a D*ck and if you no he is over at his exs house obviously he doesnt care that much about you anyways. Forget the loser find someone who is a caring person cuz if he left her for you more then likely he'll leave you for someone else. ditch him|`|M18Xwd2naa	i think personally give it time he will come around and also not judging u maybe if he is not the first person to tell u that u get angry way to easily maybe you should work on that but deffinatley give it time.|`|6OI2H85Uaa	ok first of all you and him need to chill and have a talk and he a butthead mean (stupid) ask he he can only date one girl and ask him is he dating you or her . and have a nice talk|`|Rf3U3H2gaa	Sweetie, then don't talk to him again. He was a rude nasty person to you.|`|69Qd8SEuaa	then i think you should get a new boy friend and leav him alone
nxpbj5HWaa	the first time is always the worst - it can only get better! just forget about the relationship thing when you're with a girl and if you meet someone and things progress just be open and honest. if you are nervous then tell her she'll prob be nervous too you can get through it together. just take your time and don't put so much pressure on yourself|`|8UnSNDPxaa	It sounds like your straight but just nervous.<br>  Perhaps.......you could try masterbating to boys, nothing wrong wioth it, and see if it calms you down
XsLj9jERaa	no...but do you live in the same area..?<br>  i just turned 18 and met my bf 1 month before he turned 25.<br>  we're still together and moving in together next year.<br>  :)<br>  good luck!!!|`|gRXy66dOaa	no not really|`|WcrHmGGAaa	your out of highschool...and its only 4 years..so go for it!|`|CBa9G4j4aa	No that's not bad at all.
2LmfQUbKaa	hi there is nothing wrong with the age! some men think it hurts the baby! some just are grossed out by it and some are just not into that why dont you try sitting him down and talking to him maybe he thinks it is safer to wait! talk to him! i have an older man it is a 20 year diffrent! they think diffrent then us! talk to him! good luck!|`|p2pmyMDGaa	At this stage of your relationship with this man, you should be comfortable to discuss anything.<br>  <br>  Age is not an issue but it's his heart that matters.<br>  <br>  Having a baby for a couple who longed for a family is a very joyous thing. And a marriage means 'two persons' are ready to put away their single-life, their selfishness and to be united as one. Be strong to face whatever consequences...and probably you already knew.|`|AA11108018	Some guys feel that if they are on top they might hurt the baby.  You can suggest  you being on top.  If he continues to not want to do it ask him whats wrong
TJeTaqbPaa	Because his breath stinks real bad o.O|`|T4aG8j95aa	Are you very attracted to him?  Are you having other problems in your relationship?
OLG1MaeKaa	from past experiences i know that he really does like you alot. i think that he is just afraid that you dont like him back. all that stuff that he is doing is because he likes you. the reason he is saying that he doesnt is because if you say that you dont like him he is trying to put up a wall and act like he doesnt care because he didnt like you. my advice is to tell him how you feel about him and then see what he has to say.
2ij4wwjgaa	of course you should be mad at her for lying 2 u,,,<br>  not only did she talk 2 the person she said she didnt like...she also sent him dirty pics...<br>  but its up 2 you if you want 2 start a relationship with her but just dont be surprised if she DOES lie...<br>  she seems pretty fake 2 me<br>  she might have been saying the same things about you to the other guy...<br>  but if chris and rihanna can get back 2gether after all that crap then maybe there is hope 4 the 2 of you after all...|`|jlZZbdIjaa	Don't go out with her. Hipocrits like her always end up heart broken.|`|PVsKQAVEaa	you see sometimes girls say they arent pervertic. but they are,  they are just like guys, sometimes worse. but regardless of that, if shes sending dirty pics to your friends then shes not a very decent girl. forget about her and move on.|`|iPZWtRYkaa	She's sounds pretty easy. Don't be mad. Hit it and go find another chick. This is diffidently not a girl you want to date. Sleeping with her might be fun tho.|`|a7LvtYi0aa	well i f she was sending dirty pics to ur friend thats a pretty big deal. i dont think u should waste ur time on this girl. there are plenty of better women out there.<br>  good luck =]
P8CBDLiKaa	There's nothing you need to do; she needs to earn your full trust back and that will take time as well as patience and understanding from both of you.  Not fully trusting her right away doesn't make you a bad boyfriend, just human.  Having the love and faith to give her a 2nd chance makes you a good boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Give yourselves time.|`|7n4rtfp6aa	You have to be certain that SHE loves you the same way that you love her.<br>  Does she? Or did you forgive her because you don't wanna lose her?<br>  Either way,trust is not so easily gained, so yes try and be careful for a while..if she really loves you she will change.<br>  You're not a bad boyfriend- anyone could have a slip! It's a great thing that you forgave her,but if it happens again-show her the door.<br>  Good luck to both of you.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	she will probably cheat again|`|NpzNHmCGaa	Your probably nothing to do with why she cheated. If you had/have a good relationship then how can you be the one at fault, don't blame yourself. Just carry on as you were but maybe ask her not to have contact with the guy she cheated on you with (in less its unavoidable) she should respect that and understand. If she agrees then that might help rebuild your trust in her.<br>  <br>  I think its also perfectly reasonable if your in a relationship to ask her not to have contact with guys one on one inless its unavoidable or necessary. To be fair you should agree not have unessary one to one contact with women either in less its unavoidable/necessary.|`|Q0rbUZDMaa	Break up with her bro. The reason why I say this is because, despite what she does to make it up, you'll never trust her as much as you use to. And that's just going to be a mental plague.<br>  <br>  But if, however, you are committed to making it work, then I wish you great luck.|`|XHZ5JwmCaa	Talk to her and keep being a good boyfriend she might wonder why she cheated on you. Ask her why she did it. But mostly it's up to you. But seriously consider both options there are always other girls out there. : )|`|AEzKCd8saa	You can test her but that could get a little hard. See how much she loves you by asking her questions IN PERSON! If she flirts or hangs aroung one guy alot that could be a sign that she is cheating. Also if she stops talking to you or doesn't pay as much attention to you then she usually does that could also be a sign. and i don't really think you can trust her fully again tell she really shows you how much she REALLY cares about you.|`|jkXDhtsQaa	The trust will never fully recover.  <br>  People make mistakes -- some will learn from that and never recommit again and others will always go back to the same track.<br>  If you really love her and willing to be with her after that, the only way is to let time heal and test out your love.  It will help you heal the pain you have now regarding the cheating and it also will test out if she would really change.|`|fZsKMgSwaa	You are playing a game against yourself. Trust is an important thing in a relationship. I can understand your feeling is strong for her. My suggestion would be to talk with her about that matter and see where, she is standing. That would be a proper time to ask her what was she lacking that she was tempted to find outside of the relationship, may be an occasion to but some foundation on what you want in your relationship and what you don't want. She had to listen to you as well you have to listen to her.<br>  If that doesn't work out, may be it wasn't meant to be. To my opinion, if she willingly did such thing, there is no way to really know if she will not do it again. If you are able to exceed her expectation in a relationship and convince her that you are the best man for her only, you might have a fighting chance but still it is a 50/50 option. It might work or not.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your decision, hope this will help.<br>  D.|`|rGjKC8Bcaa	Test her, but don't be all test freak. She may not be perfect, but if you really want her, guide her through to the way you want. It's not your fault she cheated on you. That was very mean of her and you could talk with her and straighten things out. Maybe it was also your fault. Here's why:<br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  <br>  1. Girls like when guys show alot of effection<br>  2. Be yourself and it wouldn't hurt to try and push (not too hard) your relashoinship<br>  3. Complement her and be there when she is hurt<br>  4. Be kind and don't lose your temper over nothing|`|sdiCDG5daa	I think you just have to trust that she loves you alot too and that she won't cheat on you because of that reason.|`|Vnah73CEaa	test her lightly. ask her questions that you know the answer to but she could very well say no to.|`|RdZP7S8naa	you cant
OUKfby38aa	well first off all he noticed it and gave it a compliment i think it means he likes u...|`|TXeUeiPHaa	He probably likes you.

Apparently the boy is checking you out. So he must think you look good. and for him to get close enought to you to observe your face (that no one else notices) must mean that he is flirting with you. Face it the boy is in to you.|`|NcAAqe9Iaa	that's a toughy. usually guys don't notice details like that, soo that's a good thing i guess lol. and he did make sure to mention that he likes the dent. it all depends on how your guys' friendship is. i personally probably wouldn't take that as flirting.|`|QFEbDUTAaa	it is a cute way of flirting...|`|wuitr1PTaa	some what|`|69Qd8SEuaa	yes i say ask him on a date

W1ZCp3U7aa	Here's the honesty you are looking for... <br>  First of all you are 14 you shouldn't be worrying too much about how you look, obsession can lead to other things.  It kinds of makes you look unconfident about yourself, and there nothing a girl can't stand more than a guy who isn't comfortable in his own skin.<br>  Secondly, you are not bad looking, but when you take pictures of yourself don't go for the serious, anger face. Its' scary.  Smiles are what it is all about.<br>  Third, if you are connecting with her on a personal level you shouldn't be worrying about looks, you should be thinking about asking this girl to hang out!!<br>  <br>  Well anyways good luck!!|`|XbbSTBvQaa	You look fine and actually hot! If you really like this girl and if she likes you too, then you shouldn't worry about personal looks. If you love the person's personality and how they are good to others then really what's the problem? Take me for example. I had the most ugliest boyfriend you can find but it really didn't matter to me because we had a solid relationship based on trust, love, and personality. Looks really don't matter but if it makes you feel any better I think your really hot! I'm telling the truth because I never lie and if she don't won't you then I'll take you if you don't mind!|`|mdOocxZ2aa	I'm 14 too. you're cute, but personality is everything. even if you're not outgoing, BE YOURSELF.

NvW6voPJaa	Hi Grace and congratulations on your recent engagement!<br>  <br>  Well, I am NO expert....just a person that enjoys weddings.  Really, even an "expert" cannot help you.  This is a decision that you and your fiance need to make....no one can help you with that.<br>  <br>  The JOP and candlelight dinner sounds nice...as does the destination wedding with 75 guests.  You two need to sit down and figure this out.  Yes, we are in a recession, but most couples still do want to have their immediate family and some friends come and witness their wedding and share in the celebration at a reception aftewards.  The two of you need to figure out if NOT having those that you care about present will....in the future...come back to haunt you.  Remember, you cannot "re-do" what is already done, so it's best to really think about this.  <br>  <br>  You don't say where you live, but if you live a distance from Hilton Head Island, then, YES, it could be a problem for family and friends to attend. BUT, you could still do a JOP wedding and then have family and friends to a dinner reception.  There IS a middle ground here.  It really doesn't need to be just one or the other.  You two could blend what each of you want and come up with "plan C".<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you have a beautiful wedding day....whatever your decision is!|`|FnskUYpqaa	I think you should have your wedding. I really think people that don't have a wedding usually always regret it. I'm having a small 80 person wedding but if I could do it over I would do a destination wedding. Only people that truly close to you will go and you won't have to worry about people wanting to go just for free food and drinks. Just tell him how you feel and that it's important to you.|`|QQgftTxxaa	I would plan for the wedding on the beach. The beaches in SC are wonderful, and you only get married once so you want it to be best. Your wedding date is so far away that yall could start saving now and it probably wont be as big of a blow to the wallet as you think.|`|o23MmGOOaa	why not tell your guest not to buy gifts, instead they may pay for there own food and drinks.this will cut the cost heaps - it cost way more to supply food and drink to everyone than what gifts you would get.<br>  If they are real friends they will not mind this, if people don't like it you don't want them at your special day anyway!<br>  <br>  also since you are in recession, it would be nice to think of this when choosing where to have the reception as people may want to come but not be able to afford a really expensive dinner. <br>  <br>  Buffets are always cheaper and easier.<br>  you can also try asking for discout if you get married on a sunday not a saturday - as they are less busy these days they may offer you good savings.<br>  <br>  when I got married I refused to pay for the venue as I said there were so many people eating and drinking there they were already making heaps. <br>  <br>  Hope all turns out well <br>  Good luck|`|76nTvO4iaa	Your fiancee is 600 miles away.<br>  <br>  He proposed in January 2009 and wants to get married ASAP.<br>  <br>  You want to wait until 21 months after he proposed to get married.<br>  <br>  Is he willing to wait that long?

XbbSTBvQaa	No your not ugly, it just means that she likes you! I'm a shy girl too and i do the same thing and it only means that she has feelings for you and likes you! Be brave and go ask her out!|`|YxrVo4wjaa	The answer is in your question. She is most likely doing this because of her shyness. It makes her uncomfortable.|`|JeUZKSQ3aa	i'm not really shy at all but most of the time when a girl looks away it means she's not that into you. sorry:/|`|CBa9G4j4aa	I don't think being ugly is a reason for her to act like that. She's probably just nervous around you. She might be nervous around all boys. I act like that sometimes too especially if I like the boy. But don't get ahead of yourself. It may not be the same for her.|`|UY6Ibd5Iaa	No, no.  If she's shy, she might like you, but maybe she just does that to everybody.  i'm shy, and that if a guy i liked did that to me, i'd clam up.... i'd probably do the same thing, lol.  just don't jump to conclusions... but maybe!!

That is a good thing. Now you can set your eyes on someone else.|`|MybJpwQlaa	It wasn't a mistake.  If he's being so sketchy just because you admitted you liked him, he obviously isn't a right match.  Don't worry about it!  Now, you don't have to waste any more time on him.  You can set your eyes on someone else.<br>  <br>  Also, letting your friends get involve can be a no-no.  It makes things messy and it doesn't come off right if your friends are doing the thing that YOU should be doing yourself.  Like talking to the boy.  Next time, you might want to tell them not to ask him out for you or anything like that.|`|PPlagXIzaa	you shouldn't regret what you did.

dwzfjlJraa	Well personally I would just go about my life and try and stay out've it. Just mind your own buisness and be firends with people who are actually your friends. You will learn later on in life that bs like this isnt worth your time or effort. if they dont want to be friends with you just accept it and be nice. Maybey they'll come around when they notice you didnt do anything and are leaving them alone..my 2 cents.

9p6EnV2caa	Immaturity.  Most boys are silly and don't know how to behave in front of girls. You wrote that "he didn't know if he liked me anymore".  I know it's hard.  Try to move on.

I would tell him straight off that you aren't interested in being friends with benefits.  But, being friends is ok.  You just might want to be wary.|`|pvjZEIDRaa	He wants action, but doesn't want the title or pressure of being in a relationship. I would suggest telling him exactly what you want...no relationship, no action! My roommate was seeing this older guy for about a year and he wouldn't commit, but she liked him so much that she went along with it and thought eventually he would commit. In the end he 'cheated' on her and ended up dating that girl shortly after, and she was so hurt. So I could see this happening in your situation.<br>  <br>  Trust your decision and your heart. No one knows you better than yourself. Be smart and be careful!|`|fZsKMgSwaa	I would clearly suggest you to move on and stop doing compromises.

p4FuV9NMaa	The answer is absolutely true!   Tungsten Rings are brittle and if you apply enough force, it will shatter the ring.   Hammer a tungsten ring against an anvil or hard surface and you will shatter the ring.<br>  <br>  What you want to do is find a good and reputable jeweler who provides a lifetime warranty and lifetime sizing on their product.   If you chip, crack or shatter the ring, a good jeweler should replace it with a new ring.   Same story goes with sizing.   If your ring size changes over time, a good jeweler should replace your tungsten ring with the correct size.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	Have you guys considered titanium? It has the same look as tungsten and is virtually indestructible. It's also resistant to scratches. It's a lot more lightweight than tungsten too. <br>  <br>  I've heard that if you put tungsten or titanium in it the freezer and then drop it it will break. But, who on earth would put a ring in the freezer? Otherwise, I really don't think that they'll break if dropped, but you should ask around to more jewelers to see if you get the same answer.|`|6L9jJnchaa	Tungsten is good, but NOT titanium!  If he were to get in an accident and his hand swelled up, they would not be able to cut the ring off his finger!|`|rzPIO1aQaa	Try titanium. My fiance worked in construction and his ring has not got scratched or broke and now he changes tires for a living and his ring is still doing great. He always wanted to wear a ring to show everyone he was taken even before we got married which was cool with me. I still bought him a titanium ring but we switched it up a little he wanted black this time so that's what I got and I engraved a message inside. <br>  <br>  I got his ring from here but there are lots of places to have great Men's rings.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.titaniumrings.com/DPBlunareclipseA.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.titaniumrings.com/DPBlunarecl...</a>|`|vCZuh3oDaa	Yes, there is a chance that a tungsten band, if dropped, will break.  But then again, why would he take it off?<br>  <br>  The solution?  Tungsten Carbide.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.titaniumkay.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.titaniumkay.com/</a><br>  <br>  My DF is an Executive Chef and he's getting a Tungsten Carbide ring w/a laser inscription on the inside.|`|884v4VhGaa	I think that the salesperson took the "yes, they can get it off your finger in an emergency" speech a little too far. "Brittle" is a relative term.|`|CJa85mSpaa	Hi! Sooo... my fiance and I just went and bought our wedding bands yesterday! It was super exciting. He also works as a chef, so I was really concerned about all the same things that you are. I didn't want something that would scratch, I wanted to make sure it would be durable enough to handle kitchen treatment. We actually finally decided to go with white gold for a few reasons.  We looked at both titanium and tungsten. We both love the look of them, but our jeweler told us a few things that made us wary of buying them. She told us that titanium scratches pretty easily, which is a huge con for us. She said the same thing that you are saying here, that the tungsten will break. Not necessarily that it will just shatter if it falls to the ground but it is very possible if it gets hit wrong or something that it will break. She also said that they give a lifetime warranty on their gold bands, which includes resurfacing if needed (get rid of scratches, discoloration, etc.), lifetime cleaning and polishing, lifetime resizing, and lifetime replacement if the ring becomes severely damaged. They said they absolutely do not guarantee their tungsten and titanium bands because titanium scratches too easily and tungsten will break. Also she talked about how easy it is to re-size a gold band but resizing tungsten or titanium is nearly impossible. You just have to make a new band pretty much. This, to me, is a huuuuuge downfall. I know that my man is going to get bigger, his hands wont always be the size they are now, and knowing we can always go back and have them re-sized is an excellent option. We went to Kay first, by the way, and the lady that waited on us there was not very helpful. We both felt like she was trying to pressure us into something that we weren't totally sold on. She didn't seem to know her stuff very well either. We finally ended up going to Jared Galleria of Jewelry and had  GREAT experience. Everybody was super helpful and knew exactly what they were talking about. Hopefully I was some help!|`|QQgftTxxaa	No because my boyfriends best friend is a manager at kays and we were also looking at tungsten because my boyfriend is a mechanic. He said it was extremely durable and pretty much nothing could break it. We were also looking at the carbon fiber and tungsten which looks pretty cool. I would go back in and ask someone else and see if they tell you the same thing.|`|AA11434290	What about a platinum ring? That metal is supposed to be durable. And they look almost like tungsten. They have that same look about them. I've been shopping for one too. Looking online. you might try platinum.

Alot of unnecessary stress, and confusion u dont need <br>  <br>  what your mother is doing is not right, but she is doing it for some type of excitement. She is obviously not happy with her and your fathers marriage any more... there is probably a lot that u don't know about their relationship... Best thing to do is confront her about it first. She where she stands in their relationship, the marriage maybe be saveable, or its been over for along time and they are just together for the kids<br>  <br>  look, talk to her, and have her seek counseling, maybe they can do marriage counseling together. and try to make their relationship work... but don't start a fire that is not needed, try another alternative in fixing it, before jumping the gun<br>  <br>  again what your mother is doing is not right!! not right at all, its is morally wrong... she is human too, and i am sure she is unhappy, and just trying to do something to fix that unhappiness :(|`|4vdtR7sSaa	wow. u HAVE to tell ur dad. shes practically cheating on him it sounds like|`|JL3BxW4paa	yes, TELL YOUR DAD. definitely, becase thats just not right!<br>  their relationship cant survive on lies.<br>  <br>  orr> give her number to like on  of your friends and pretend to be someone else, telling her shes 'aught" or somthing.<br>  <br>  ooorr. just SHOW the pixx to ur dad. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|DKGiGbxGaa	Your mom is a grown a-- women.

If your parents are separated then by all means talk to your mother about it and let her know, but then leave it alone. If your parents are separated, then there is a reason.  Legal separation is one step away from divorced.  If it really bothers you the way your mother conducts her life, and you parents are separated, and she doesn't wish to change, maybe you would be better off living with you dad.|`|XEtlXEagaa	tell, ur mom...i'm srry u hav 2 go thro this..:(

When i first meet a girl i like it to be a challenge.  I think you should be cocky and a little concieted but do not over do it.   But the best thing to do is just be yourself.  I know you wouldnt like to date a guy and a couple weeks later you two find out your true selves and then it became a disaster.  Just be yourself.
iRZE3fEPaa	i say go for it...that way you wont wonder....you only have one life to live so live it to the fullest...dont go through life wondering|`|u5mo0p1jaa	physical appearance isnt everything. he should like you for whats on the inside and if he doesnt then he isnt worth it. so yes go for it because if you dont you might have regrets. everything will be fine|`|yv3hBhbGaa	dont lose touch cause if you guys dont end up dating you guys could still be friends and all. plus he shouldnt compare you two. if he does then hes not worth it.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	remember you don't know anything about him like you would normally by the time you got to sharing intimate details<br>  all you know is what he told you which doesn't make it true<br>  most of the time these end up bad|`|LzJJn1m7aa	I would go for it but take someone with you please!!

9dcj2zFFaa	Sit down with her alone, and tell her.  Three nice things about herself, for example, "youre so kind and thoughtful, youre very smart, everyone likes you, I think youre funny" OK? Get it.  Then, say I just dont feel the same about you, and I dont want to hurt your feelings by continuing to see you.  I hope you understand.  Then look serious but not sad.  When you leave after that, smile. No kiss or hug.  She will be ok.  DO NOT prolong this and put it off.  DO NOT say we can be friends... that is really bad, very bad -- females hate that.|`|cbmwayh3aa	Okay how many guys do you think use the line " im not ready for a relationship"<br>  seriously?<br>  that will hurt her even more! especially if you say that and then go out with a girl a week or month later. And if you say that then she will probably tell her other friends that u dont want a relationship so then no other girl will go for u! There really is no way to let a girl down easy and dont use the lets just be friends thing its cheesy. Just tell her the truth..... just say i think your really pretty and nice and funny but i dont think i want to date you cause it would ruin are friendship and I think were better off as friends!|`|AA11843514	Tell her thanks but your not looking for a girlfriend right now.|`|mqucJZSUaa	just say your not ready for a relationship right now.|`|iE7k6Vzraa	Don't lead her on-flirt with other girls in front of her-hook her up with someone else.Treat her like a buddy etc...

You are going to look back at this and laugh.|`|6lmFyr2maa	just tell them honestly. they'll apreciate hearing from you first.<br>  <br>  just a word of advice... listen to whatever they say and take your punishment without arguing or answering back (if you have one, i don't know how strict your parents are).<br>  <br>  trust me it'll make you life so much easier.<br>  xxx|`|85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	Sincerely tell them that you made a big mistake and you lied and got caught and now the school is going to call them.Remember liars are loosers and the truth will set you free.|`|AA11108018	Mom and dad I lied to you about where I went after the basketball game last week.

I lied to you, and it's tearing me up inside. I wanted to tell you myself so you didn't hear about it first from someone else.'|`|fvuEtkROaa	Tell them exactly what you said here... you want to be the one to tell them rather than have them find out some other way. Be ready for some anger,crying, etc.  Parents all want to think they did a better job of raising their kids, and the parties were always attended by somebody else.  Be brave.  Good luck.|`|mqucJZSUaa	well if you were drinking then you should tell them.<br>  actually you should tell them no matter what.|`|6j9xT5njaa	ok so the best thing to do would have been to tell them the truth in the first place. u should deffinately just come out and tell them the truth. u may get in trouble but its worth it in the end when u have a parents trust. I had a similar problem with lies and for a long time they couldnt trust me. the thing is to just tell the truth and theyll trust u more and allow u to do more believing youll b trustworthy :)|`|30f515cdf3875c0a4df5afed4d563a8daa	Maybe you do not realize yet that your act was breaking your people's confidence on you. Confidence is broken in seconds but takes a very long time to rebuild. You shall not have a second chance , so do not miss that first one. Be straight and clear, and pay the price you'll have to pay.<br>  Once you jump into the cold water you will cease to be afraid of it. You shall be rather dealing of how to get out of it the quickest and the safest for all, and for the long run.<br>  Good luck|`|QOWPdl2qaa	Wait until they've been home from work a while and tell them just what you told us. Let them know that you know what you did was wrong and you didn't drink (which I hope you didn't). Let them know that you'll never do it again, that you're sorry, and you're going to accept whatever punishment they have.|`|K1uUvEcWaa	be like mom dad i went to a party instead of my friends.<br>  im sorry i lied. but any second or day now you will be getting a phone call saying there was alcohol there, but dont worry, i did not drink any. i just wanted you to hear it from me first. sorry i lied. i will take whatever punishment is necessary :]|`|7stgbWJyaa	Just say to them you need to tell them about something, but first, let them tell you they love you! Then, you tell them what happened, and say sorry.|`|fd5924c397f5b6b2236018882cccd4a7aa	Coming clean is hard, but they deserve to hear it from you.  Hopefully you will tell them before they find out another way.  Be ready to accept your punishment and don't object to it.  That would just look like you are not sorry.|`|ANsznbWsaa	Just be flat out honest. That's all you can do and they will probably appreciate you telling them before they get called by the school.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	Well All I say is that there's nothing better than saying the truth exactly how it is, good luck|`|cbmwayh3aa	Okay well you should definetly come clean before the school calls! Cause then they will only think ur sorry cause you got caught and then when u apoligize they wont trust u anymore. So this is what you do just break down crying an say i feel so horrible and omg i cant believe i went behind ur backs im a horrible person blah blah blah they will still be mad but at the same time more sympathetic and understanding because you came clean and told them the truth ahahahah okayyyy good luck!|`|AA11843514	Are you telling them because you know the school is going to call?  If so, your not really being honest.  You can still tell them but make sure that you say sorry.  Once you start showing that you can't be trusted, it's hard for a parent to believe anything you say.  Trust me, I'm a dad.|`|bZlk1d5Maa	Just tell them that.<br>  Don't sugar coat it, because they'll be even madder if you make it sound like not a big deal, and then they get a brutal call from the school<br>  <br>  Assure them you didn't drink if you didn't, though|`|tu1m1dkoaa	Tell them you didnt know that was going to be drinking going on and you didnt know it was a party.|`|ar7CW3ZEaa	u should never have lied to ur parents because i have learn not to do it anymore becuase the more u lie  they will not belevive you at all.|`|GAN7XY11aa	you should..<br>  take away their phone!!! >:]|`|onxVq6OVaa	good idea just tell them straight up maybe if you are too afriaid write them a note

FBhjhjR0aa	Never follow just your heart and or mind. It's always best to look at everything. 1. If you make the choice, what good is going to come from it? 2. What bad will come from it? 3. Will it hurt anyone? 4. Will you be hurt? You have to think of every outcome from the choice you make. Then decide what's worth it?|`|8ZUs3qxxaa	Gosh, don't be so black-and-white. It DEPENDS. You can't just apply one philosophy to every single thing and circumstance in life.<br>  <br>  But if you have to choose, use your head first and foremost. Your emotions can often be clouded with anger or hurt, which can be dangerous, as they can lead a lot of people to act dementedly and irrationally.<br>  <br>  But never leave it at that (unless it's a straightout circumstance like a math problem or whether or not to buy a cute pair of flats).

We are still married today, and have been married for 2 years now.<br>  <br>  As far as you're concerned, here is my deal.  I always had the 2 year/5 year rule.  Marriage/engagement had to be brought up within 2 years of dating.  Then, we had to be married, or at least engaged after 5 years of dating.  If one of those didn't happen, then I'd move on and be with someone else.<br>  <br>  Give it another year and see how things go.  If he proposes in the meantime, great.

That's outside stuff.  What you look for is whether they have a brain in their head, are they nice, do they act like they want to be with you or every other one walking down the street, do they talk about everyone as if they are losers.

sP7xLWfSaa	i think you should talk to him, dont auto say lets go out. tell him how you feel and talk about it with him. it will only ruin you friendship if you let it, if you feel awkward then he will feel awkward. just relax and tell him how you feel. dont worry about the future. in my opinion everything happens for a reason...good luck =]|`|4oq9pK8naa	I had the same situation a couple of years back. I asked the guy out and it was alright but eventually we broke up. And well it definitely did ruin our friendship, it was awkward. To this day we don't talk the same way we use to. And even though it didn't work out I was glad I asked him out, because if I hadn't I would have always thought "what if I had??"  It was also an experience. So I think you should make a move and if things don't work out then hopefully you can go back to your normal friendship. Also I guess back then I was a bit immature and that's what made things awkward after wards, so as long as you're mature I'm sure you can make things work :) Good luck with whatever you chose to do.|`|ZFL4ScBGaa	Personally, you can never truly believe what others tell you when it comes to this stuff, but at least it's a nice place to start. If you like him then I say you ask him if it's true that he likes you back. <br>  <br>  Nothing ventured nothing gained right? ;D|`|4d7XGLReaa	ok ask ur friends to ask him if he likes you and if he is gonna ask you out and then if they say he wants to ask you out try and get ur friends to push him to ask you out.|`|2EHDf6BEaa	If he knows that You like Him than I should wait until he asks you out.

zzaScg0haa	Maybe her friend doesn't really like you
AA12037238	I think once everything is done with, you will feel it.  Something similar happened to me when my dad died alcohol related.  as much as I tried not to make a big deal out of it by saying it was going to happen sooner or later. It did hit.<br>   he was the man that raised me and was there for me as your Mom was no matter if you knew she would eventually die, she gave birth to you and loved and raised you.  You need to allow grieving, now is not the time to get all hard core and stone cold, Im sure there will be others in your family who will need your shoulder and kind word not robo-cop responses.<br>  <br>  My sympathies to you and your family on your loss|`|ODbwZsnoaa	maybe your brain hasn't taken it in yet<br>  or maybe since you we're expecting it, it's not that big of a deal to you?<br>  <br>  O.o|`|dKTPewhTaa	It will probably hit you when you least expect it.|`|Yh4CXJgdaa	when my friend died it took a week before it set it . <br>  just wait <br>  youll see what i mean|`|VYKYuEh5aa	I'm really sorry, and my heart goes out to you and your family, the closest pseron to me that has died was my papa (grandad), I went from seeing him everyday of my life to once every few weeks during his last year alive, that was 10 or 11 years ago when I was 18, it hit me hard, but I think it was weeks or even months later that it hit me, sounds a bit like you haven't really taken it in yet, and even though you were rationally expecting it, ithas come out of the blue emotionally, but dont feel bad about your feelings, keeping them in or denying them won't help, but at the same time, you will experience her loss at some stage, all I can reccommend is speaking to someone close to you, but again dont fell bad about what you are or are not feeling as the passing of a loved one affects everyone different. One girl I know of didnt cry or feel anything after her mother died or after the funeral, but broke down a good while later when her cat died, it can take time, so dont force it, good luck and hope that I have been at least a little help, those who live on in the hearts of others, shall never die.|`|BJERgbM5aa	It's not a bad sign.  she was sick.  Obviously incurable.  She was expected to die, and she did.  Now she's at peace.  In your own way and in your own time, you'll miss her.  For the time being though, try to be on your guard and show some compassion for the others who feel differently than you.  They'll feel better and so will you.  Condolences.|`|AA11112243	First off, i'm sorry for loss......she is your mother.  I think once you get around your family you will feel something.  It just hasn't hit you yet.  I was the same way when i found out my aunt passed a few weeks ago and i couldn't even cry at the funeral.  I just think your in a kind of shocked state of mind.  Maybe your connection to your mother is why you don't feel anything....where you close at all?
HKkbqlIuaa	That does not sound like someone you want to be with. I wouldn't loan her money for 2 reasons. 1. You haven't known her that long. It's very rude of her to expect you to loan her money, especially $500. 2. She definitely should not be so demanding about it. If she expects you to do her a favor, she should be kissing up, not making threats. Sounds like you should leave her. If she's this much of a b*tch only two weeks into the relationship, can you imagine after a couple of months. Leave while you can.|`|xWdBGitfaa	hell no! If i was you i would most DEFINITELY not give her the money. You've only been with her 2 weeks come on.

Sometimes a man might suck in one area but is perfect in many other ways. You might see it as settling but it is alwyas easier to judge looking in.<br>  And yes, love is a very powerful thing.  Until you have experience real love (which in most of these cases it is one way versus mutual) you will never understand.<br>  <br>  Life is full of compromises.  Were it not, we all would die single.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Why are you such a b*tch??<br>  Don't you realize that even though a man may treat there wife or girlfriend like crap, most women will still love them.

Most people fail because they think everything should just come naturally with no conscious effort, which is bs. A marriage takes effort most people are willing to adapt and work hard in their career but never put that same effort in their relationships. <br>  Appreciate each other, tell each other thank you for the basics (house chores etc...) and remember how you treated him when you were trying to win him over in the beginning and treat him that way now and it will be reciprocated. <br>  Two killers of marriage: bad finance and a daily humdrum with no light at the end of the tunnel. Infidelity and everything else can be linked back to those two things.|`|ANsznbWsaa	It's just part of being married. Things aren't going to be like they were when you were dating. It's part of being comfortable and secure in each other, it's not necessarily a bad thing. Just make special time for the two of you. Have special dates, talk to him about it, and don't be afraid to initiate what you want yourself. <br>  There is nothing wrong with your marriage, it's just maturing. You have to work at it to keep it exciting. Don't expect things to be how they were and you won't be disappointed by how they are.

BJERgbM5aa	They all do it.  All don't admit it, but they do.  Why?  Because they don't trust us.  Why?  Because we really can't be trusted, can we?  Remember, they really are a lot smarter than we are when it comes to things like that.  My wife would nail me in a minute!  And that's the other thing.  We're really afraid of them.  and we should be.  They can make life really miserable if you've been a bad boy.  You know it, and they know it.|`|JN6LWA6Oaa	All girls do that man, well most do. They want to know if we've been flirting or even cheating, they just don't trust us because most men are jerks, how do they know we aren't the same as others, you know?

rpnFxnCQaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  I think that you and your husband should talk. This is key.<br>  <br>  Beside communication, you may want to spice things up ... My husband and I tried this website (recommended by my best friend) ... Hundred sex games ... It is highly Erotic. When my husband and I tried some "games", it was like having a new partner. Like falling in Love all over again. We had still been in love but our relationship has since reached a new level. More completeness. You may want to give this a try.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fire-up-your-sex-life.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fire-up-your-sex-life.com/</a><br>  <br>  All the best!|`|6PhSENcXaa	I dated Chris for 4 years we met at 14 and married at 18.  We didn't have any sex till we got married on our honey moon.  We've been married for 31 years this year and Chris keeps the fire burning in our bedroom.   Foreplay and making love is not a problem we've done it every night since we've been married.  With the exception of when I had my period.  And no porn movies or toys are used.<br>  <br>  You need to spice it up some come up with new things to try, new ways to do it.  Something to add life to your love life, role play anything. Ask him if there's something different that he has thought of that he might want to try.|`|874EAxkfaa	oh oh ,you got one of those kind of men, most men love the foreplay,and doing it with the tongue. you just got a defective model,and they are non repairable on a permanent basis i mean.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	Take him shopping to the local sex shop.|`|VHA9qrVSaa	You both have to talk about this.<br>  Viagra or a book on Sex For Dummies!<br>  Good Luck!|`|3fbc09a4f95e4122e563714d654a599eaa	Yes you should of been communicating how you felt from the start of the relationship.  You need to tell him what you like and how you like it even if you have to draw a map to show him lol.  Whatever you do, do NOT tell him he is a bad lover that will just make matters worse.  Next time you both are in the mood tell him you are not going to get any of this using your hands and flirting until you do this first.  Make a game out of it.  You can also make your own dice which have little messages on it and play a game which you roll or he rolls and you both have to do what it tells you to do.  Sex should be fun.  After awhile it does get to be the samo samo however you have to spice it up.  Watch a porn and play monkey see monkey do lol.  There are countless of things you can do you both just need to use your imagination.  If he doesn't want to do anything different then I suggest marriage counseling.<br>  <br>  P.S Truthseeker you shouldn't cast stones on others and who are you to judge.  You should only judge yourself.  I am pretty sure you have skeletons in your closet as well.|`|jkXDhtsQaa	I understand how you feel -- but I guess you have to seriously talk to him about your feelings. <br>  <br>  Sex is a very important thing in a relationship/marriage.  If it goes down the hill, things will eventually fall apart. <br>  <br>  If you want this relationship to work, you have to talk to him and both of you have to make an effort to work on it.  =|`|512dd30dd4fa35da6b4c826537a039ccaa	This could be God's punishment for sleeping with a man who is not your husband.  Well, I sure hope the baby is his and not some other man's.  Since you sleep with the guy, shouldn't he be your husband?  Why do you call him fiancee anyways since you two have already become one through sexual union.  Is your father against you two being together?  Get right with God first.|`|iPZWtRYkaa	Yeah screw that guy! ******* religious assholes! That sucks pretty bad. Are you sure he's not getting it anywhere else? Maybe he's afraid of hurting you or the baby right now? Maybe he's not attracted to you pregnant. Hope this isn't to brutal.

LADIES, PLEASE...here's a newsflash...Men do not know how to read your minds!  You can pout and play games all you want, but if you want to get something from your man, you have to sit him down and tell him...heck show him!  Shame on you for not communicating with him for these many years, or worshiping his body as you would like him to worship your body.  Hey, your pregnant...did it occur to you that maybe he's trying to be delicate with you because of your condition?  He's never mentioned **** jobs, so you assumed he wouldn't want it...IN THREE YEARS!!!!  Yet, you sit there complaining about the lack of reciprocation?  Come on now, be fair to the man!  Sit down and talk to him.  Show him what you want to do to him and what you want done to you.  Be specific, be sensual, and be reciprocal.  Best of luck and sort this out now or you'll never have a happy sensual life.

ozzNLjNfaa	Obviously his friends are jealous of your bf. I really think they should have nothing to do with it, and if they're really his friends, they would respect his decision of you being his gf. What the hell is that, for friends to decide who your bf / gf will be? I guess the only way out is for the guy to not be friends with his "friends" anymore. They're being hella stupid. Don't let anything outside of your relationship influence you to make a decision. Be happy you're with this guy, he seems like a good person.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|BvlYQMf1aa	well if they are doing that to him they arent really his friends.<br>  they dont care who he dates even if they like that girl (you) or not<br>  they will support him on whatever he does.<br>  so they arent really his friends|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	tell u all Raddy have some one and u can`t Judases the relationship  with boyfriend|`|Xg9tvcOJaa	just tell his friends stop it already|`|iqw1mrWZaa	those guys are just a bunch of jerks and arent worth it.<br>  just tell them to get a life and stop revolving around yours!|`|80DPSlhJaa	I think you should stick with your boyfriend.<br>  If his friends threaten to do that, they are not real friends.|`|Wbvjff4Gaa	if the guy youre dating likes you enough then he will deal with his friends! if i were you i wouldnt let it bother me. try just telling the guys friends that you do NOT like them and you are perfectly happy with the guy youre dating.|`|snAWnR8vaa	they dont sound like friends if they arent happy for you guys sorry not much to do but i perfer my friends over a partner but tell them to deak with it|`|HDjigCnaaa	disz dude sound like he jealous and he wantsz to get wit U
AA10065812	?????<br>  Are you under the mistaken impression that you're an adult and mature enough to make your own decisions?  <br>  <br>  If you say YES, than you must be a better person than Jesus Christ because he wasn't mature enough to make his own decisions until he was 30.  And, he was a perfect human being.  You must think you're greater han perfect.<br>  <br>  The only reason you get to be considered a LEGAL adult is by DEFAULT.  You didn't earn it.  The boys do.  They earn by registering for the draft, something the women's groups lack any courage to take on and demand that girls should register, too.  <br>  <br>  Females don't reach full emotional and physical mature until age 24.  You will continue to develop until than.  Males don't reach it until age 30.  At 18, it has been only 6 years since you BEGAN developing the ability of conceptual thought.<br>  <br>  Your parents are there to keep you on the right path.  Not the easy one, leading to the wide open gate, but on the rocky one, leading to the very narrow gate.  You may not like it, but when your child is 18, you will understand why it was necessary.<br>  <br>  Yes, your parents are paying your tuition, and you should respect their decision for that, but moreover, you respect their decisions because they have been where you are now.  They have the experience of life you are no where near having.  <br>  <br>  Here's a book to read:<br>  <br>  Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess up Their Lives <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stupid-Things-Women-Do-to-Mess-up-Their-Lives/Dr-Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060976491/?itm=3" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stu...</a>|`|rzPIO1aQaa	find your own place to live, you are an adult and you can pick and choose what you do and you have your own rules. Don't let them control you any longer or they will try for the rest of their lives. College is something you wanted so I guess their rules kind of do apply, unless you can get school loans, financial aid or grants to where you can earn the money yourself and be an adult.|`|VYKYuEh5aa	they shouldn't be stopping you from seeing your friends, unless there is something your not telling about, such as are you out all night partying or are they a bad crowd, part from that, then it's none of their business, and if they continue, you should call their bluff and get a job or something, even if you have to go part time at your studies, dont know if your in the US or what, but in Britain, I dont know of anyone who would put up with that, and also in Britain, it would be you who pays for your tuition once you start to make a certain amount of money after you;'ve finished college, (although paying for college is relatively a new thing in Britain), either way, if they are being unreasonable and your mates are not going to mess your life up then just see how feasible getting a job and supporting yourselff is, if nothing else, it will prove to them how much you value your education, and also that you are willing and able to make decisions for yourself and support yourself.|`|yYvFF2fDaa	If you stay at their house, you have to follow their rules. It IS their house. If you don't like it you can always find another place to stay when home on breaks/summer... then you will have to follow those rules too. <br>  <br>  So, the only option is to get your own place.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking that if they are paying for your college, i would stick it out. College is expensive and can cause lots of debt, debt that they are willing to take on so you don't have to. You have a good thing. So what if you have to follow some rules. They are doing a LOT for you. They don't have to.|`|PMrTleDJaa	ow. Obviously they re protective parents.  Them paying for college is not that big of a deal.  My parents are going to help me pay for college but on the other hand they would definitely let me party.  Im in High school and I party.

Ks4YN4iHaa	I love when people say " when we have the money" we will have children, well if that is what they are waiting on- it will never happen! My husband and I waited almost 3 years after getting married, and I don't think we planned on it! It just happened! I think that if you marry someone, the topic of having children should of come up before the wedding and maybe just goes from there. We never "knew" but believe that there is someone else that knows for us and it happens when it is suppose to!

EswkNpFqaa	what people say they want in a significant other is not what they are actually attracted to. Attraction is not a choice. He might feel a lot better and be more excited to be around wild and crazy girls than a sweet nice one who doesn't excite him. Shy girls can be boring.|`|GopaUZOJaa	if he wants to be better, being with a nice girl with high values might influence him to be that way as well.

One might be that they actually yearn for love, instead of lust. When they try it out and are forced to wait for what they want they abandon it. Two perhaps he has been told that he is all over everyone and is self-conscious and decided that he should change... but failed because he tried to fall in love with a girl instead of letting nature take it's course.|`|hVdAgEWhaa	my boyfriend use to be a hardcore druggie, and i stopped him from doing drug's and turned him into a better person? <br>  leave people alone, along with there life. jeez.|`|82163eeb88eeb393905532febf8a4276aa	do you like him?talk to him.|`|oRr9SOIqaa	Haha I know it's annoying =/|`|S0QQ6D92aa	u can't really do anything about it...
AA12301267	I'm thinking maybe the girls are jealous of her or envy her in a way since she looks pretty and everything about her sounds awesome. And the guys they are probably just dumb to hate her for no reason. They probably want some weird slutty girl or something. Either way those people don't matter what matters is that your friend likes who she is and doesn't care what nobody thinks because I think she sounds like an awesome person ^_^ Hope I helped even a little|`|yEe3WkFCaa	I know someone just like that.....<br>  <br>  ;)<br>  <br>  And I think she is very pretty and funny, athletic.<br>  And she shouldn't care what others say because they are all.....

Your friend is tops at what she does, and the other girls are probably losers that don't understand how a Greek girl can be cooler than they are.  Their immaturity is part of the problem.  Hopefully they'll grow up some day.|`|iRZE3fEPaa	there just jealous....|`|YWE5YIRJaa	dude i understand the same goes with my friend and theres really nothing you can do except just be with her and stick up to her and i know you probably feel annoyed but i guess the world always seems to judge a book by its cover and follow tho "cool" kids which is stupid your friend sounds really cool!!!!!!|`|a6p6zaYFaa	Omg!! i fricken live her life!!! this girl seriously is like the same exact thing is me! I'm a top cross country and track runner, and I'm Greek and hey I think I'm pretty and people tell me I have a nice body, and people say I have a good personality, yet almost my whole grade hates me for no reason. It honestly gives me motivation to do better at the things that I do so I can prove to them who they should and shouldnt hate. I dont care because I'm confident and nobody can tell me otherwise.<br>  =]<br>  <br>  Euxaristo panagiota!|`|eO6GqpOqaa	They are probably just jealous and I bet you asked the guys in front of the girls, or the girls just told you the guys hate her too. If she is as pretty, outgoing and has the body she says she does, I bet 100% they are jealous. Girls are shallow and hate any girl they feel is a threat to them. Get used to it because it won't end in High School.
wVC7I0LPaa	depends on what you get<br>  a shirt is around 10-30 dollars<br>  sweaters: 20-60 dollars<br>  jeans: 20-50 dollars<br>  tanks: 7-25 dollars<br>  <br>  ps.

v96pYAg1aa	Sex nowadays is some how the #1 thing that everyone seems to be talking about lately...sex is just a great experience too but it should only b tried with the person that loves u and only for love that's what I believe its all about compassion  for the other person and its a whole new level of love in between as well|`|0aW15UFGaa	depending on age relly, how every, boy are maturting a lot younger, so, were sarting to see women for women, more than, "oh look, we could have sex with her". i do beliveve sex is importatn tho, it a way for both partners to have fun, and to show there passion for the other. but you could go into, oh, be he doesnt want to do anythink but sex, but, beacuse we dont know your resioning for asking this question, the awnsers will change. <br>  <br>  over all i dont think sex is a major thought for guys as much as people say.|`|OUKfby38aa	well i'm not a guy but i thought my bf didnt think it was important because he was the one that was telling me how waiting is a goos thing and the risks of having sex at a young age..but since we got togehter and started fooling around he has told me he wants to do it with me already and it been only a few months..i think is not that important but guys are always desprate for more..|`|0gOWh0z2aa	I think sex has never been any more or less important.  People are people.  Sex is more out in the open now, so it seems more important.|`|BqO5xKLkaa	Yes. It has to be done at the right time of the relationship, otherwise (for some people) it's over.<br>  Don't do it too soon.<br>  And if you have a "friend with benefits" kind of thing, make sure they know that they are because you might hurt their feelings if they find out later.. it's a bad situation.
AA24Sn4kaa	every time he texts you, either say nothing or respond with something about your bf. i had the same prob, and this worked like a charm. but you have to be consistent with mentioning the boyfriend. it will annoy him and he'll slowly back off.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	show it to your bf|`|84b2777cc69c41b43d99c853cd3c3469aa	Sometimes you have to be mean to get a point across. Change your number and don't text him back.|`|9dcj2zFFaa	First, tell him, point blank... please stop.<br>  Next, never answer him. <br>  That should work.
zJBbEt6Maa	Well I'm sure your boyfriend is still attracted to you it's just that for men it is alot easier for us to "explode" as you put it and well alot of the time we would like to keep it stiff but that thing does what it wants to. So I suggest that after this happens wait 15 minutes or so and go at it again. But while you're waiting this is a good time for some foreplay you don't want to ruin the mood by sitting there like a sack of potatoes.|`|sQBcIcAnaa	Just give him a day or two  of rest   get him hydrated more water vitamins e  and zinc  and others <br>  <br>  but most of all rest  learn  stop and go method|`|7XIa76Usaa	If you want him to stay hard you can experiment doing it in different positions and when he is having his orgasm you tighten the mussels inside your vagina and keep making long slow strokes during his orgasm. By experimenting this way you will learn how to keep him hard for possibly after his first and second orgasm. After his second orgasm his erection will last much longer [possibly two hours}.|`|AA10277662	i really don't think its because hes not attraced to you...he still gets it up which is a good thing maybe hes just trying really hard to make you happy that when he does *** a second time is just to much for him...just ask him wants going on|`|Ti3GoXcKaa	Hes just not attracted to you nomore...probably the way you talk and write sentences. Or something else. As long as he gets his, then good 4 him!|`|BtR8zpySaa	you should talk to him about it
3qaXA0oBaa	either have a party that everyone can come to or call off the party. it's not nice to exclude. you will find later that you will not be invited to parties and that will be why. find a way to have everyone come even if you have to change locations or seriously don't do it.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Wow, it seems that you are a very well-liked person which is good.  Tell them that you are sorry about this situation and maybe next time that you have a party, your friends cannot tell other people about the party.|`|68kRhQdTaa	maybe you shouldn't of told them you were have a B-day party.|`|tQ3WyorPaa	tell the other people that you would love for them to go but that they cant...maybe you should all plan to go out the day after or something|`|9OHeder5aa	Are you serious?

8p31dENPaa	I was a virgin until a few months ago. I'm 25 years old. I told my boyfriend a month into our relationship because he needed to understand why we weren't progressing physically as fast as "normal". At first he was taken off guard, but it didn't change how he felt about me or our relationship. We took things slower and he waited until I was ready. It took 7 months before we made love. I don't regret waiting until I was 25, we don't regret waiting 7 months, and we don't regret making love. We've been together a year next month. We're in love and it was right for us.|`|GcKVfvJqaa	i agree with the one girl<br>  leave him<br>  you could...wait <br>  you CAN find better<br>  hahaha<br>  but if you dont want to lose him and you really like him say (this only aplys if you want to have sex)<br>                 "I want you to show me how its done!"<br>  He might get turned on by that.|`|9hpuBMuIaa	There is nothing wrong with being a virgin at 23.  One thing you need to remember that virginity is something you can give, but you can't get it back.  The guy may have reacted oddly because he had never gone out with someone who wasn't ready to hop into bed with him.  Some guys are just shocked that every girl doesn't hop in the sack. <br>    I went out with a guy and when I told him I was a virgin he laughed and said No girls are virgins any more they just claim to be to make the guy work harder to get in their pants.  That type of guy needs to be put in a cage with the other animals. We never had another date.<br>    If it is important to you, then that's all that matters. You don't need to use it as an excuse to not have sex, it's a reason to stay true to yourself and a real guy will respect that.|`|CYNZvlMGaa	well most people loose their virginity at a young age it might be a turn off for some guys cause they want a girl with expirience and know what theyre doing but for some it might not it might give a guy a new expirience u know more of a viriety som guys like 2 teach girls.|`|Q4D5T5vwaa	don't be ashamed about being a virgin. i'm 19 and i still am a virgin & loving it.<br>  <br>  if the guy doesn't like that, then leave him. he doesn't respect you, and you deserve better.|`|oDFyPGOkaa	i'm Capricorn
lN5d688gaa	just because he is 30 years old physically does not mean that he is 30 years old mentally.  there's the difference.  he is still so childish.  you will have more pain if you go back to him.  you are strong you will be fine.  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|GHd84xipaa	sounds like you need to get rid of this 30 y/o loser.you and your children don't need this.you will never be happy.it will also cause problems with your children if they see you fighting all the time.he's not a man.he's still an irresponsible boy.what you need to do is get your own place that's big enough for you and the children.there's help out there for women w/children.you can apply for section 8 housing and get help from social services.they will paid for child care so you can go to school or learn a trade.you can also get child support from him the courts will see to that.i wish you good luck and a good life.|`|LvTIVjySaa	Yes.  Raise your child without this man in the picture.  What a prize, cheated, stole, lied, beaten you...I can understand why you think about him..LIKE A RECURRING NIGHTMARE!  I just don't know why you don't think about paying for him to get fixed, so he doesn't ruin the world with anymore replicas of himself that are going to treat a woman like dirt.  He's a loser, but you already knew that one.  You wanted to be the one to change him...you know, make him grow a pair and man up.  Problem is, sweetie, he isn't going to grow for you, your child, or anyone else.  The best thing he can teach a child is how not to be like him.  Other than that, and perhaps some financial aid, I don't see what benefit he is to your child or society in general.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	You are thinking of him that way because of the love you shared and you are thinking of 18-20 years of always being reminded about or having to relate to him (if he steps up, which I pray he does, for the child's sake) for a loooong time to come. What I have found when men (my daughters fathers - 2 different men who both turned out to be dogs) disappoint me is to look forward and try really hard not to look back. Walk into the future with determination, courage, strength and a fearlessness to find better love next time. Let him go 100%.  What remains will give you power but under control.|`|veZLfnGFaa	He sounds like a 30 year old brat.  There's no way you can change him or make him step up and be a man.  Sounds like you really love him.  If you can live with this behavior, then you have no choice.  Otherwise, you can move on and try to do the best you can do for you and your child.|`|AA11843514	There are plenty of thirty year old boys out there.  He hasn't grown up yet.  If he is putting his hands on you, you don't need him.  Your child don't need that kind of example as a dad.  If he doesn't want you someone else will.  Pack your bags and step.  Love yourself first then love your child and do what is best for the two of you.  Love is a commitment.|`|bdLnUhRCaa	you need to move on, once a cheater always a cheater. and if he hit you while you were pregnant, he'll hit you after the baby is born. you probably still think of him because of what he put through, and he is your son's father,not because you love him. he will always be in your life, because of your son. but you need to find someone who is more mature and stepp up to his responsibilities.i have been in that same position not once but twice. but i have found my angel,we have been together for 8 years now. your angel is out there, too.|`|Q7M9YbZiaa	wow well if he is 30 then he isnt going to grow up, and be a man. <br>  you can do better, sure there will be feelings for him but you can move on and find you a better man.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	You have stars in your eyes thinking about giving birth to a child with someone that you really cared about. The only problem is he will not change because you want him to and who knows if the birth of his child will even do it.  If he beat on you before you got pregnant, as soon as you have the child he will start all over again because he will say you trapped him intentionally. Sorry to say but he doesn't sound like a good man to have around, especially when you want you child to have some morals and values. Sorry I can't give you any, but I do hope that I am wrong and when he sees his child he will know what a wonderful thing that happened. If that doesn't change him, nothing will.
zY8uu241aa	Oh, you have no idea.  I found the most perfect girl I've ever met (or rather, she found me) and went out with her for almost 3 months (80 days 14 hours and 53 minutes, actually).  Then she broke up with me, saying she didn't know why and she didn't want to, but she didn't feel like "it" was there anymore.  She got over it pretty quickly, which I'm glad about because I want to see her happy, and she has a new boyfriend, but two months later I'm still here in love with her and trying my best to get over her.  I've had small crushes on a couple other girls since then, but nothing coalesced with either, and now I'm not even quite as good of friends with one as I had been before.  I feel like I'm losing everyone, and all I'm trying to do is make things feel right again without my ex.  I'm not succeeding in this endeavor.  I feel more lonely and hopeless than I've pretty much ever felt before.  Ever.<br>  <br>  If there's a guy who likes you, give it a chance and see what happens.  If it works out and you're happy, congrats.  If it doesn't, you gave it a shot and learned from it.  And don't be scared; despite all my complaining above, I don't regret a thing about my situation, past or present.  If nothing else, it prepares me to help others out.  So go for it, trust me.  Good luck!|`|alh9OsQXaa	Hang in there :)<br>  ANYONE in that situation would feel the same. If there is that one guy who likes you, why not give him a shot? What I say is if someone likes you, don't just say no because your not sure about it. Who knows? Get to know him and you might like him back!<br>  Hang in there!!! :)|`|jQz5vABzaa	Send me an email, tell me where ur at and let me see if I have contacts that can help you meet someone of my network of friends :)<br>  I'm actually happy I'm single at the moment.. lol<br>  <br>  Take good care and hey ur not alone!<br>  <br>  Cookie|`|65ojSBXgaa	Dont feel or be lonely.

BUT on the other hand, lack of intimacy and affection is starting to get to me and sometimes i feel like i need to beat the F notes out of anyone or even just get a knife and start stabing myself from frustration. So,k since you are a young female and high school should be your priority know, keep in mind that you don't know anything about being lonely.  Feel better about yourself and don't need a boyfriend to confirm your 'hotness'. you don't want 2 b eager 2 be with anyone. if you do one of these mistakes you will set your self up for big dissapointment. Years from now when you are an older woman who is making something of herself and are ready to find a guy WORTHY of YOUR time, THAN start worrying about who you want to be with and not ending up lonely.|`|fZsKMgSwaa	Sometimes it is better to know oneself better and set what you want from a person to have a relationship with. How you can come up to that? You can do it from your peers: parent, friends, life experience, observations. Yet, avoid the trap of living on the moon and expecting what movies, TV and fairy tales are constantly feeding. Don't put your standard too low, too high, when you are ready? The right guy will show up. Focus on getting a good education, you will be glad you did in the future. Don't think that you are oblige to do like everyone, you are not everyone, never forget that.<br>  <br>  Hope this help.<br>  D.|`|bFKnx2FHaa	Awww. This reminds me of myself! I used to be so lonely... I will try to look for guys online and all the time I failed. I wanted to have a boyfriend and be happy like everyone else. The person who will be meant for you will come to you, think of two magnets, they come together without putting any force. The love of your life will come to you when you least expect it.|`|PCDuyf8raa	yah im 16 im a guy, honestly i dont plan to get a girlfriend til im out of highschool, i think its just dumb to have one right now, i mean sure i want one but i think i got enough to deal with, so yah i do get lonely at times ,but i dont know thats me. look if your feeling lonely then get a hobby or something keeps your mind in control|`|KFP75UVyaa	Dont stress sweetie. This does not mean that anyone doesnt find you attractive or anything. Its just that there is somone waiting for you that is so much better. Many of those boys and girls that you are talking about will have guy after guy and then get married to one of those guys. She will have many children by mulitple guys. Why you will be happily settled down with one man and his kids.Dont be lonely. Here is my advice to you (I just got out of high school two years ago) just party continue your studies. and focus on your friends. Trust me when i say that your friends you will need in the future. More than guys. There is a right guy out there for you. TRUST ME. I got mine the same way because i was to proud to settle for less.|`|JBaBIIS5aa	im lonely but i have one.<br>  you should be glad you dont have to deal with relationship drama i never knew i could be so sad in my life or cry as hard.<br>  i just got back together with my bf but then i realized he already had a rebound planned out. so idk anymore.<br>  i think you should be proud im the one that needs the advice haha.

llxqG6Otaa	Are you relaxed when he's doing it? Most women don't relax, or let them selves go, so it's difficult to have an orgasam. ALso don't be afraid to be vocal with your guy, guys like to be told what to do exactly the way you want it. There gratification is found in that, becasue they are pleasing you, the way you wanna be pleased. Try to relax, and tell him exactly what you want him to do, and when to do it. After a few times it will get easier, and he'll just know exactly what to do to make you without you telling him.|`|UjajMHH4aa	Okay, every single time my boyfriend has done it to me i have, so maybe your boyfriend is not all that experienced with it. You need to tell him that your not getting off, tell him it feels really good but guide him around, he can't tell if it feels good or not, so you have to make sure you tell him exactly what he's doing, and believe me it will feel amazing!|`|y1gzkWDaaa	it is not common, may be he is not giving you the time until you cumm<br>  you should be in the position you most feel it and take the time ,at the end you will cumm, have fun and relax
AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.
cMyPQ90vaa	i would talk to her about it because that is wrong and she wouldn't like it if you was the one doing it so just talk to her and let her know how you feel. good luck|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You need to confront to her about it.  Communication is the key to the relationship.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	Break up with her, and ask out her best friend. Tell her to enjoy being with this other guy. Good luck|`|0aW15UFGaa	confront her...ask her it makes u uncomnfitable even if its her beeing nice. the worst she can is say no, then you have to give her a chose, to pick, you or firlting.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	It is only flirting it's not like she is having sex with them but if you don't like it tell her she needs to stop and if she don't the dump her.|`|zUdxoRbyaa	tell her to knock it off or hit the road.|`|xWdBGitfaa	I would say something to her. Fix the problem.|`|AA11658640	Please don't confront her about it because it makes you look weak and jealous which will only make her do it more. What you need to do is flirt with another girl too while you're out with her or at a social setting. She'll probably wont like it and will ask you about it and then you can say you don't really like her flirting too. <br>  <br>  Either way it'll probably end with both of you laughing or her being better about flirting.|`|W1ZCp3U7aa	Tell her that it makes you feel uncomfortable.  If she really likes you she will understand and try to refrain from doing it.  But when you do talk to her about it, make sure she knows that you trust her and you know nothing would happen, just make it clear its because you care.  Choose your words wisely, the wrongs one can turn this into something it isn't.|`|OU8n1EPSaa	if it's really bothering you, tell her how you feel.<br>  personally, if i was flirting innocently and my man told me he didn't like it, i'd cut it out if i was serious about him.|`|tMUBBDASaa	tell her calmly that you dont like like it and that it hurts you|`|I1RD1a3kaa	What!!

tUwcX7Euaa	my mom was pretty panicked when i got married as well. the day was very emotional for me and her. it is completely common for a mother to be worried. she is letting go of her baby that she raised. if you have kids, apply it to them it's scary to think about their wedding day. they will be so proud of you once the wedding is finalized. so don't worry it is so great to be married about this nothing to be scared or anything.|`|w9e9ePKoaa	your a junior in college and your 18? no way|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I'm sure they're just concerned - a lot of people have it in their heads that young marriages can't work - they can. They just take more work. Don't worry about it Enjoy being married and don't let anyone get you down.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	its the age thing. she probably didnt imagine you getting married for many more years and its just coming sooner than she thought. my parents were the same way when me and my fiance told them. were getting married when hes 22 and im 20. and i think its because of the age, your young and they probably dont think your ready.|`|6YADkFr7aa	That's what mothers do. They worry about their precious little baby. Like for instance when I went to the Service my mother all 98 pounds of her still worried about her baby son and I was 26 at the time. So you can be 150 yrs old and your momma is going to worry about her sweet little baby girl. So have a ball and live it up momma is you best friend|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	part of it is your age because so many people your age don't know enough about themselves to be married and need to think of how things affect both of you, also its hard for most parents to watch their kids move on to their own lives and families|`|fd5924c397f5b6b2236018882cccd4a7aa	I would be more concerned if they weren't worried.  Weddings are stressful and expensive and no one knows if the marriage is forever.  They just want the best for their daughter.|`|xssqrr7Yaa	I think it's the fact that you are both young.  It's hard to see their baby grow up.  Marriage is quite a commitment too and the way the economy is, they may worry about how you will survive on your own.  I was 19 when I got married.  Now that I look back,  I was way too young and with the wrong man.  Not only that, but I had a child 6 months later and I wasn't ready for motherhood either.  Things just happened at the wrong time in our lives.  With my second marriage, I was cautious before I jumped in with both feet.  We waited 6 years before we got married and now I will have been with him for 25 years.  I have a daughter who also married at 19.  I worried about her, but she has a pretty level head on her shoulders.  Her and her husband have been together for 15 years now, so I guess age isn't really a factor.  They don't have any children either so it isn't necessarily the glue that binds. Their love is still strong.  Best wishes on your wedding!
AfwYNFN5aa	You can try to smile when she stares at you or wave. Try to work out near her, and ask her questions about how long she's been, and work your way up. =)|`|AA11108018	You can make a big sign that said hi I would like to to know you  You find a way to get her to come over by you or some place in between.

Xtj4kvwsaa	If you find yourself uncomfortable or not wanting to express how you feel or be yourself while talking to him maybe you're not comfortable around him and maybe he's the wrong one. I was in the same position where I was dating someone who lived in a different town and all we did was talk on AIM and it just didn't seem like a real relationship. <br>   <br>  I know it's a little mean to say but you're yong and 2 months isn't love. It seems to me that what he's saying is just "love talk". But if you don't want to dump him then talk  to him about how you feel, or wait a week. See if your feelings change. It could be just a small phase. But if you do feel the same way after a week or so then kindly tell him you think you guys wont work out.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|AEzKCd8saa	I have been in the same situation!! and it bugs the crap out of me when guys play the worried card and wont leave you alone about it. anyway all you gotta do is tell him that u just need time to think. You can also tell him y you are sad. and if you and him really "love" eachother then you 2 should just talk about it and just forget about it.|`|AtiTFsj0aa	Sorry to be so frank with you, but that was the worst thing you can do. He was obviously just worried and cared about you so what do you do? You ignore him and basically walk away. In his eyes you are saying leave me alone, so that's what he's doing.

UUrqECXIaa	Well, I've had a number of issues in my life that were really tough to get through. Probably the worst was trying to care for my sick child. My youngest son developed some mental health issues when he was 9, the final dx became OCD. <br>  <br>  Have you ever seen the show Monk? Well, uncontrolled OCD in a child is NOTHING like that. He was unstable for nearly two years. It totally rocked our world, I never felt so out of control of something in my life. He suffered a great deal, and the rest of the family suffered right a long with him. It was heartbreaking. There's nothing worse than watching your child suffer and not knowing how to help them. It's eight years later, still some problems but life is much better. It was a long hard road to get to this point.<br>  <br>  This is probably not the kind of story you were looking for.|`|lyWSufFBaa	Life.  <br>  <br>  Homeless at 16 for nearly a year, 3 attempted suicides, one miscarriage at the age 22, diagnosed with manic depressive disorder/ social anxiety disorder and a sex addiction. <br>  <br>  But here I am, 25 years old going to school full time at the Art Institute of Charlotte, working full time and still hanging in there.  I may have walked through a few storms but I never fell down.  I am determined to make a better life for myself and refuse to become a statistic.   :)|`|LvTIVjySaa	Too much in my 42 (nearly) years.  I've had a gun pulled on me by a nutter in the midst of road rage...Experienced first love, and the heartbreak of losing it...lost two pets, lost numerous family members...lost one friend to murder, and another to accidental death at someone else's hands...married and divorced a man whom I never should've crossed paths with...married the man who truly holds my heart...lost and gained back a special relationship with my family...almost died in surgery...lost 100 pounds...bought my first home...survived an attack from a burglar in my home and ended up kicking HIS butt.<br>  <br>  Why vent?  I am healthier than I have ever been, thinner, more financially secure than ever, in a great job for the past four years, in love with my husband, and most importantly alive.

Ndiek49Caa	I would just try being slowly more forward. Say hi randomly to him and things like that. Maybe talk to him outside of school whether it's via facebook, cell phone (texting), or whatever. Just make an effort so he knows you're interested. Give him the confidence he needs in order to make a move. Some guys seems shy, but have a completely different side. It's his other side you need to try to get to. Good luck =].|`|3Cvi2530aa	just go talk to him and ask him out. unexpected and wonderful things will happen!
Y5FyAekkaa	First be clear he was staring at you and not a cheater....lol.<br>  <br>  Since u have that class in common start by striking up a conversation related to that. There is no law that you can't assert ur interest first. Just give him ur number and say.."gimmie a call sometime, we'll get dinner or something". Also pay really close attention to what he talks about or wears...boys and girls both love to talk about themselves. Mention the patch on his jacket or ask about a band he mentions. Its a great way to open conversation and then feel him out for a definate signal.

All the best.|`|qlqxDGBHaa	If you're serious - it is logical that you would feel a strong attraction to the father of your child. After all, you united in the sacred act of sex, and now you have a child to call your own, by his seed. You are parents together, so it is natural to feel a strong bond with him and miss him. It is hard to say whether this is love or lust. Do you miss him for the sex, or the physical arousal of being with him? Or do you miss him for reasons of liking him for who he is, and what he has done? It might be either, depending on how you answer those questions, or it might be a mix of both. You should talk to him.
dJ9AFIEPaa	Send him a card.
6J8sHGRIaa	Don't think about him anymore. You could find someone else to crush on besides this boy. Don't worry, there's a lot more guys out there than just him. But, a quick question, is there something wrong with having a crush on him? If you're really serious by trying to get rid of this crush, I say you try to ignore him whenever you see him around. That might work... but who knows? <br>  <br>  Good luck getting rid of it...|`|vFldqvN4aa	do things to keep your mind off him and try to find someone that likes you right off and then it will all work out i promise : ) thanx for answering my q!|`|Py1qVpwhaa	Well, just try to keep your mind off of him.

XPu8M8xMaa	If he constantly stares, then you have every right in the world to ask him "what are you looking at!?!" but in a nice way of course, don't come off too strong or anything.<br>  <br>  Also, I totally understand you want him to come up to you first...but making small talk, friendly conversation (and not going out of your way to do it) is more than fine...since he DOES stare at you and everything...make him feel more comfortable around you, and let him see you're a nice person and all that. <br>  <br>  Once the atmosphere is "relaxed" then its up to him to make a move...he it doesn't then, oh well. If he does...do your thing girl!

If it truly is the person, perhaps you just haven't found that one person yet. Just because someone is "perfect" doesn't mean that they are perfect for you. Everyone is different. Maybe you should ask yourself are you being shallow about guys? There is no great advice for this. You either need to change, or you just haven't met the right guy yet. Before you just "leave" the next guy, ask yourself why you're leaving. Is it really a valid reason for a break up?|`|M0vQFHg9aa	Because you are not in love. Love is when you won't to be with someone, focusing on their personality, and enjoy being with them. Your relationship went bad probably because you didn't take it seriously, and/or you weren't in love. People get together because they feel they love each other, but it doesn't always work out. But, what you are doing is just messing around, always jumping around. Calm down, no one is perfect, and there will always be someone you think might be better, but it doesn't mean they are.|`|mgPVHveyaa	thats exactly how i feeel,<br>  just wait, the right person will come eventually..|`|Ce6BJIJJaa	its called human nature we always want something better none of us are ever happy just live in the moment

Whether he is or isnt regardless shes obviously not happy. Apparently, with them fighting everyday. that is not a way to live.a great relationship has few arguments but always end in making up. a relationship with no arguments will never last. One that argues almost everyday and seems endless is no relationship at all just a brother or sister fighting.|`|NcAAqe9Iaa	well if your friend really wants to be with the guy then she'll have to stop letting what other people say affect her. whether he cheated or not. i'm not saying cheating is okay at all and there has to be a reason why EVERYONE is saying he has cheated. the couple just has to talk things out, and if that doesn't work then there's no other choice than to call it quits.|`|jh196wDmaa	She should dump him.<br>  She obviously put 2 years of her time into him and that's how he repays her?! <br>  <br>  No guy who cheats on a girl more than once deserves their time.<br>  She should find someone who realizes what they have when they have her.

3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	We all say we want a nice guy, but it rarely works that way. We are drawn to men that we feel can protect us. Guys that are confident, masculine, "guy's guy" and not too much of an ***. Guys that can have fun and make us laugh. Nice is great, but save that until you're commited, and even then don't be TOO nice all the time or it's just kind of sickening.|`|HHyny0JSaa	When he remembers the littlest thing that is important to me that he could care less about. Like when he picks me up a pack of skittles (my fave!) when he's at the gas station, or a book about something I like, or cooks my fave dinner.... just anything that reminds me that he thinks of me and that he cares enough to know what I like, even if it's trivial. Make sense??|`|7hZLgQOMaa	It's little things that he does that really just make me happy =] like when he hugs me a lot longer than a hug should actually last or like when he kisses me on the cheek. He also likes to grab my sides from behind and pull me towards him lol he always catches me off guard and I luv it!

l5opEF8Zaa	I'm not doing this for the points, just putting it flat out. <br>  <br>  1) Girls need to talk to each other. That's how they get comfort. <br>  <br>  2) You did over react. She didn't really show here friend your weakness, just what happened last night and see if she could get some advice or help from HER friend, just like you;re getting advice now. <br>  <br>  For now, I advise:<br>  <br>  -Stay nice<br>  -Abortion pills dude. You do NOT want a child on your hands. <br>  -Don't worry! Keep your girlfriend happy and don't pick over small stuff like that. If you do get mad over, now that's weakness.|`|94b8KImYaa	1. I don't think it is right from her to go out to her friend and share your personal stuff with her. Now this is me. Many take "Sex and the City" as a guideline on how things should be between best friends. I had friends like that - and when I refused to talk about intimate details, they got all worked up about it.<br>  In a partnership, the partner must come first. Not respecting your wishes in not sharing your feelings with outsiders means she is not respecting you. <br>  2. If she said as you say, that if she would be pregnant from you she would kill your baby also tells you, that she is not that much into you. It is irrational. If she is pregnant and she would be scared, I can understand that - but to emphasis on "your baby" is strange to me. <br>  <br>  Now: it could be, that she is really pregnant and her hormones are starting to go nuts......<br>  <br>  How about the 2 of you first find out if she is pregnant. <br>  If she is not - leave right away<br>  If she is - tell her what you want to tell her - (taking responsibility for a child etc) and then leave.<br>  For the future, I only can suggest to check on birth control to avoid situation like this. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you|`|H5qJPekAaa	Well it seems to me that you guys should break up. It seems like you guys just like to piss each other off. And that last thing about her saying that if it was you that got her prego she won't have it that is fucked up. I think that if she did that to you before I say that you guys should break up. But it is your decision. But think over everything for a while. Then ask yourself should I break up with her or should we stay together? Also think will I regret breaking up with her if I do? Was the fight big enough to end it?  Then decide. But I say maybe consider breaking up with her. It is obvious that she isn't sensitive like you. So maybe that makes you guys incompatible. Your like me im sensitive, and when I am with a person who isn't it is really hard to make it work. So I need a guy who is sensitive.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Sounds like it is time for a new girlfriend. This doesn't seem to be working out.|`|w1necKzYaa	I agree! that was a fucked up thing to say! you should get the hell out of that relationship before it is too late!|`|fe7024a07d620a01f5d9c8b83f62d3c6aa	I'm 19 as well. I personally wouldn't be prepared for a pregnancy into my life this age nor with a girl i've been dating for three months. (I don't know you or your entire situation with her either so don't be offended or feel I'm making a statement in regards to all 19 year old's & 3 month relationships). But What I will say is this. People in relationships will hit bumps and also you know you probably have said some pretty harsh things in the heat of the moment, I know I have. She did apologize which should be enough if you feel she meant it. Many people (male & female) need to tell others their problems. Her friend may be the ventalation system she needs when you guys argue. I know i wouldn't want my girl to be bottled up about something, especially it regarding me. I, like you, have a very hard time expressing my feelings. I'm a closed book when it comes to emotions and venting. I hope you can relate when i say that deep down you know it feels crappy to feel that way. I wouldn't want her to suffer through what I do. So you should be a little understanding on her about it. You don't need to accept it. just understand. I think the whole pregnancy situation is a toughy. I think there are possible answers to why she feels that way. Maybe she truly is scared about being pregnant. She may say she would "kill" your baby because you know that she would most likely only have your baby during this time. Unless she has been messing around which I cannot make allegations towards. But I think she would say that jokingly, whether or not it's being done in a harsh manner. She may just truly be terrified of the situation and joking could be her way of making it better in her eyes. Don't feel foolish about it and who has the right to tell you what to cry about, it's your life. If you really have feelings for her don't ruin it over a few harsh words and maybe if you try to open up a little it may help her with her insecurities as well. I know that it has for me in the past.|`|t81MEJ82aa	You have every right to be upset but honestly you are better off if she doesn't have the baby. This should scare you in the future of making better decisions of who you are with. It's not worth it at all to be so careless. If you think she's disrespecting you now, you just wait if she's pregnant. Take care of this situation and run as far away as you can. And stop being so thin skinned.|`|0HOGn7njaa	tell her she is too insensitive to be a mother. however, she is probably stressed if she thinks shes preggers so you should forgive her for spazzing. dont take it over and over again though if she repeats.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	Lose this twisted whore and get yourself back in school where you belong- you'll never get anywhere without a college education, even if it's community college.|`|TXeUeiPHaa	Dude!! You need some serious advice!!!|`|l854IXBgaa	dude this girl has some serious ISSUES!<br>  I think you  should dump her, she doesn't seem worth it.|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	You have every right to be upset..That was a horrible thing to say to you.  <br>  Yes...she violated your trust as far as telling her best friend but it is what women do...we talk about the things that go on in our lives to our best friend.  Don't let that one get to you too much. <br>   As far as the other issue...that was en-excusable.  I would seriously want to reevaluate why you would want to be with someone that would talk to you this way.  What made her think it was ok to say something like on such an important topic.  <br>  You asked if this was worth crying about...Absolutely.  I know I would if someone said that to me.|`|8ZUs3qxxaa	Aw...I feel really bad for you!<br>  But anyway, looking at this from your gf's perspective, she was probably really guilty about hurting you and felt too shaky and blames herself too much to face you directly.<br>  <br>  And it IS her BEST friend, so...Hey, a girl's allowed to have trusted friends, isn't she? That other girl isn't her BEST friend for nothing; your gf must really trust her. She probably just really wanted to let out all that had happened, to relieve the burden about the argument and talk to someone about it...not you because she probably thought that you would be really mad at her.<br>  <br>  And there's absolutely nothing to cry if you two can calm down (composure is key!) and settle this without drama. Forgive each other. You each did something not-so-great.<br>  <br>  I mean, you offended her by "joking" as you were. You'd be surprised at how many girls get really personally insulted by that kind of stuff. She came to you really scared, and you kind of just blew it off and seemed like you didn't care (and I'm not saying you didn't).<br>  <br>  And since people can say all kinds of stuff when they're really upset, don't blame her too much. I mean, she obviously didn't really mean it, since she apologized in tears later on when her head had cleared a little from all the anger/pain/whatever.<br>  <br>  Um, just guessing. Making assumptions, but that's just usually what happens. Hope that helps you! Good luck! :)<br>  <br>  *...But on second thoughts, if she'll say stuff about you like that, you might want to be careful with her...might have some anger control problems and might break down too easily...sorry, I don't really know her.|`|clrYAxgDaa	Ok man, it seems to mean you got to grow some b**** and talk to her. Tell her that the sh** she keeps doing is bothering you and that if she keeps doing it that you'll leave her. And if she doese, leave her! She is not worth your feelings. And bout that killing your kid thing, tell her that she better apologize n tell you that she was kidding cuz if she wasn't, don't even say anithing just get your stuff or just turn around and leave. Don't think about her or answer her calls. If she comes crying, so what? She deservs it.|`|fMzl8d4Zaa	no you are not at fault.<br>  that was very wrong of her to go against your wishes.<br>  especially after she did it before.<br>  it was very wrong what she said to you.<br>  i think you deserve to have a girl that will treat you with respect.<br>  because if she's going to tell you that she would kill "your baby alone"<br>  that should be a red flag right there.<br>  because that's basically implying that she's being with other guys.<br>  you shouldn't beat yourself up over this.<br>  none of it was your fault.<br>  you should really talk to her and tell her that you just want to let her know how you feel.<br>  but her abusing you like that verbally is wrong.<br>  and if she can't realize that then she doesn't deserve your hospitality and care.<br>  you obviously do care for her and it seems like she does too.<br>  but if you love someone you won't say things like that to hurt them.<br>  so i think you should really talk to her and try to know her mind.<br>  what she feels about the situation.|`|rTPofcWRaa	Your gf was sooo mean for doing that and she is extremely shallow for doing that to you. Also, the baby has no control wether you are its dad or some other guy so killing it would be harsh. I say to dump her, shes obviously not worth it.|`|LfdoDGKwaa	aww**** dump her dont be foolish look if u still love her than fine but dont let her say tht 2 u!!!! look you sound like a decent guy and I'm sorry but she sounds like a ***** from what ur saying so you should dump her but do it nicely so she dosent do anything she might regret|`|f8GcD2CFaa	you sound like a very nice guy she just doesn't sound right for you there are a lot of other people out there and i would break up with her if she can't respect your feelings and she goes behind your back!!!good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|lhxe2XOeaa	well she shouldnt have told her friend so ur right there.but dont bug her about the baby and tempt another fight.just let her know ur there for her and put ur say in|`|mxSerLuKaa	Maybe she is just going through puberty.But in my opinion I would dump her.|`|858a0632fe3d77a7fe9bf558aaa8a346aa	It's impossible for you to give 20 points here...|`|AA11231094	Ok, so ya 19, and your Gf is a damn idiot. It is sickening to me to hear that she actually thought about killing a unborn baby much less has the balls to tell you that she would only kill a child of your>????? Sick chic, and ya don't want her MOTHERING any child of your i can assure you of that. So I'd tell you come meet my beautiful daughter... lol Many many more beautiful woman inside and out to form a family with but first make sure she is even worth being a wife much less a mother to your child.. very good luck sweet boy and please, run don't walk out of this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AlrCZJ3saa	i think you should cut the **** and worry about other things. Like sonosons. An advanced form of super worms. These super worms are so powerful that they can literally tear you apart from the inside out and kill the elderly. These things can eat anything, even lava. There has been word that sonoson chirogodas are even stronger than fuqable snapping turtles. If your infected, go to the nearest geek squad. The geek squad wont do anything but they will just look at you and say to you * are you fauking retarded?|`|CQVzUcw7aa	If she can't respect what you ask, then ask her how she would feel if you told your friends embarrassing things about her. Talk to her about this and ask her not to do it again. If she does, end things.<br>  <br>  But needless to say, you need a better girlfriend that treats you better with respect. And don't get to deep in this relationship because the same things will keep happening.|`|FC3vwPA2aa	ur right about her not respecting ur privacy... u know, since you told her not to tell so thats one thing.<br>  <br>  Now the other thing is that shes having a hard time and as a girl i would know, and she needs someone to tell things 2. thats wat a best friend is for. I think u shoudl just talk 2 her about it but be gentle, u gotta show her u understand her..<br>  <br>  i wish u good luck! i hope it all wroks out.|`|Mr9McLtiaa	What the hell u doin making jokes about a very serious situation!  Joking at that moment was inappropriate, if shes unable to turn to u when she needs u most of course she is going to confide in her friend instead. She spased on u cuz  u belittled her fears and if u are having unprotected sex this is a valid and very real fear for young girl.  I agree with her I might have said the same thing (out of anger). I sure wouldnt want to tote around an ediots baby.  Grow up elevate ur mind to maturity, dont be having sex if ur not ready to deal with the consequences: 1) a baby 2) an STD.|`|XbbSTBvQaa	Oh My God! That's was so mean of your girlfriend and your not alone in this, i totally agree with you and it's not wrong to cry about it at all. To have a good solid relationship is to have that trust system going on! Here I'll give you an example. My old boyfriend and I had this trust system to where if I need to tell him anything i could trust him not to tell anyone else. See there was this time where I thought my friends were turning against me, so I knew I was able to go and tell him about and how it made me feel. And to tell you the truth, I actually shed a few tears about it and I'm a person who doesn't cry over a lot of things but this had really hurt me. If your relationship doesn't have that trust system then what's the point of staying with her? Love will run out quickly in a relationship at the age of 19 and I'm impressed that you made it to 3 months when other relationships will fall out after the second week! Your girlfriend should have an understanding and compassionate feeling for your feelings and if she don't then ask yourself this does she really love you and does she want to stay with you? Sit down with her and have a discussion about this trust issue and why she goes behind your back and say the mean things to you? I hope your relationship works out and if it don't then you just need to leave her if she can't be compassionate about your feelings! Plus I think your a real man if you can express your feelings and cry about some things that hurts you! To me that's a real man! Good Luck!|`|d2b9398162a86367a0d530ff05ca8782aa	end it. and plus it is a girl's instinct to tell her best friend what hapned if it was hard for her, because she needs someone to go to, and that would be her best friend since she is in a fight with you. that's most likely why she did that, but everything else she did....not cool. i say end it, if she is gonna be like you shouldn't be with someone who treats you like that and gets to the extreme of making you cry. it seems liek she doesn't care about you or your feelings so why should you deserve to be with her? you need someone loving and caring (which is not ur current girlfriend)<br>  <br>  hope i helped :) and good luck!|`|gzF01pauaa	well, it is only natural for a girl to want to tell her bestfriend about issues. even if you didn't want her to, we have to vent the way we are feeling, and i doubt her friend would tell anyone. if she is a good friend. you are kind of over reacting to that. but the baby thing, that is OUTRAGEOUS. i would break up with her for that. when it comes there, you aren't over reacting.|`|h0i3TkURaa	I think you shouldn't have said the pregnant thing but Let the friend thing go girls r really sensitive. They ALL WAYS confide in there friends. And when she said she would kill it she was mad at you, for a good reason. Also if she got pregnant by someone else it could have been before you or a really bad mistake. She could be resenting it and that would be a reason to be mad at you as well.  I think you should just talk to her calmly about it. <br>  <br>                                                           Hope I helped|`|jnISkz6Waa	Every girl has someone to go to to talk and vent, she is probably scared. It's a lot more to deal with for a girl and by saying that she is pregnant  you make her stress and contemplate it more than she already has to. Her best friend is probably the one she is trying to get advice about the pregnancy from. Another point of view may be all she was looking for. Trust me if this was unplanned she is more stressed trying to figure this out then you know.|`|PprVz2RGaa	dont break up with her just yet. pull through. talk it out. its a girl thing. we naturally have to tell eachother things./ buttttttttttt she also shouldnt have gone against your word.<br>  <br>  try putting the emotions on hold, and talk about it. also te pregnant thing?? deffinitly talk about that seriously without getting too angry with eachother. hope this helps. good luck|`|Q7M9YbZiaa	If you guys have only been together for three months i would end i now before you really really serious. you know? pregnant or not, if she is messing around dont be with her. thats not good in a relationship, you need someone who will respect you.|`|ar9YVnTTaa	ummm wow.<br>  no offence but i think she was joking.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and it couldn't POSSIBLY be your baby if you've only been together for 3 months! <br>  <br>  UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, ALREADY. WHICH WOULD BE DUMB.|`|Cvvq4Ou2aa	I think you should tell her how YOU feel. Be open with her and tell her that you don't want her to tell another person about this. It's personal stuff and I think she'll understand. But be gentle with her, she's probably in a pretty harsh situation. Step into her shoes and look from her point of view first, then talk with her. Plus, it's okay to be a bit sensitive sometimes; once again, talk to her about this.<br>  <br>  I hope everything works out with you guys. All in all, it's your decision. Remember to listen to her opinions too. Good luck with everything (:
EedkDoMYaa	what that other guy said was mean and closed-minded...dont listen to him...be who you are and never feel bad about that...if your mom understands you then she shouldnt have a big problem adjusting, if she doesn't understand you then i would say ease her into it really slowly until she is as comfortable with you as you are...maybe ask her for money and go pick some stuff out yourself for now...good luck|`|HURcAIu2aa	Just ask hear and say mom can we buy some girl clothes?<br>  Jeez some people are fuckkingg rude and stupid <br>  Good luck! :)|`|FM5QFfgLaa	you stick with one gender<br>  dont ask|`|VN18al90aa	Perhaps you should take them for a trip to Anne Summers so you can show them what a little darling you could look?

Say " I'm sorry ______ but I don't like you that way but I hope we can be friends" or don't say anything and try to act normal.|`|3l7lNAqhaa	I would feel very uncomfortable around that person and it would make it even worse that I don't like that person I would just come out and say that I don't really like you.|`|LcYQVj4Vaa	Ignore them|`|zEy0Y9Vbaa	say thank you and tell her you like someone else.
AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|IDQ5YnO7aa	he likes you. don't listen to any girl that responds to this post|`|WHBh88HQaa	He definitely likes you! The clues are right in front of you!

zzaScg0haa	He probably isn't real, just her ideal of a man
cggkcAC5aa	Well the bothof you cant be shy because that will never work and you two will never get to meet eachother well. So since he is shy, you have to work up the courage to tell him that you like him. let him know. One night you can say something like, "I want to tell you something, but there's a possibility it might make things weird between us. Can I tell you?" If he says yes, then say, "I really like you as a friend, but I've really started to like you as more than a friend. I'm not expecting a response because I know it might make you feel awkward, especially if you don't feel the same way. I also don't want to put you on the spot because I don't want to ruin our friendship. But I just wanted you to know in case you do feel the same way."<br>  He will respond. This always works for me, i hope it works for you too =] good luck! and i hope this helped!|`|he3O1RFUaa	Try to start talking to him and being friendly to him! Ease into the flirting and although it might not be successful at first, keep trying. He might fall for you an extra amount because of your effort and he will appreciate it in the future. Help him out! (And help yourself get him as a boyfriend!)|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Go after him and tell him not to worry. You will just need to take the lead at least at first, if you are ok with that. Might be a great relationship because you can call the shots if you can just get him to trust you a bit.|`|cDzDzmNQaa	Well;<br>  Hm; TALK TO HIM.<br>  Just do it.<br>  Talk to him as much as possible.<br>  And, just bring it up randomly<br>  after ya'll have been talking<br>  for a while.|`|EswkNpFqaa	Move on, he is not ready for girls.|`|x7FjDcjzaa	he is autistic|`|oZpqEdI7aa	Your freshmen?|`|874EAxkfaa	show him your nuts!|`|UGSlEhnbaa	Move on and find a guy who really appreciates you. You deserve to have fun in high school because after that, its work work work. If you are not ready to move on, go up to him and ask him to go on a date. It never hurts to just ask, that is unless you are denied. Be brave and just ask, its better to know than not to. Take the first jump and he'll follow.|`|a51zEYrNaa	that's kind of what i'm like, i'm kind of not that comfortable around guys yet (i'm a girl, haha and i'm 15 but i'm shy so it really sucks) and i get really nervous and anxious. don't make fun of him, give him time and let him get comfortable around him, and make him feel like he can trust you . it will be worth it, you might be able to break his shyness, and that's a huge favor someone can do for someone that suffers from being shy. believe me.|`|CfCJyV2Paa	Maybe you should speak to him about it. Tell him what you think, maybe give him tips about how to treat a girl. I mean, I'm sure he already knows that you like him. Just say him one day "you know Billy [<-insert name there], girls like it when a guy is bold about liking them. It's okay to be shy, but put on a brave face at least."|`|WHBh88HQaa	Talk to him about it If you don't nothing is going to happen right? he is obviously shy but if you guys get closer and closer he could probably tell you about anything.

2KAqLbqiaa	Make like a million cookies and go to the boring news channels, mute the TV, and talk over them and say really random, stupid things. For example, Chris Matthews might say: "The economy still sucks" something along those lines. You mute the TV and make him say: "I've always thought that Jimmy Carter had a weave." (no offense to Former President Carter). I don't know. That's just what I do with my friends. It's especially funny when you've got a whole group of people doing the voice-over together. :)|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	do yahoo answers<br>  go to polls and surveys<br>  (under entertainment)<br>  you can do some silly answers <br>  in that section|`|jTV6rLX3aa	watch movies, play games, listen to music, give eachother makeovers, paint nails, read magazines, show eachother random websites (stumbleupon, youtube videos, etc), turn up music and dance, do art, do crafts, study together, go jogging together, swimming?, bake cookies/make dinner, just be goofy and have fun!|`|sjLUe4Kxaa	Show her the power of yahoo answers.<br>  <br>  She'll get sucked in then have no life like the rest of us.|`|2S2onP86aa	Watch movies - gossip - make dinner - search things online and check Facebook or MySpace.

There's nothing wrong with admiring the body of another human being. I think they're just teasing you and trying to freak you out. Ignore it and find a nice girl.

Your common friend who told him that you liked him will also let you know if he still likes you assuming you guys can not talk after  church this sunday.Your parents presence at church does not mean that you guys can not talk as it is expected that children will talk to one another, you will have time to exchange contact information like cell or phone numbers, text info, or any other contact info. Unless you need time for something else, the minute you exchange contact information, you can talk to each other later for as long as you want.|`|xiaiKVFYaa	You can look back or forward and see if he keeps looking at you.

It bothered me that he's looking at another woman or women who can do things I'll never be able to do. I was scared he was setting expectations that I wouldn't fulfill. <br>  <br>  We talked about it, he explained it to me in a way I can really understand, and I'm fine with it, especially when I'm on my monthly. As long as it isn't too frequent, and he still prefers me, it's all good.<br>  <br>  At this point, he's a boy, and he has to get sex from somewhere, since I won't give it to him. I'd much rahter he did it behind a monitor than another woman's door.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	I don't understand either.  I don't care one way or another.  If hubby is horny and I have 10,000 things to do or am just not in the mood, he can sit at the computer and watch it, I really don't care.  I know he loves me, he is happy with me, and I am secure in my relationship.  I know that he's not going to dump me and run after Jenna Jameson (if he could get her away from Tito, that is).

It's fine if a man looks, as long as they don't touch.<br>  My husband and I have been together for 13 years and sometimes it ads a little spice to the bedroom. If nothing more the dialog is good for a laugh..lol;)
y6I1f78gaa	No. Its emotionally tough for the kids. And may even be hard for them when they get older, cuz they won't know where to settle down.|`|AA11789493	I guess it depends the reason for moving around alot.  If you are a military family, you have no choice.  When I was in elementary school we moved from one apartment to another in a very small town.  I guess it was moving up so far as the parents were concerned.  I was embarrassed and didn't feel normal.  I vowed that once I could buy a house I would never move again.  I've moved from one state to another a couple of times because of work, etc., but once I finally got settled I've been in the same house for 37 years.  I can't say that the moving adversely affected me, but it made me feel uneasy and maybe a little insecure as a kid.  I don't know--it depends!!!|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Earlier on, it isn't too tough, but when they hit their teens, they need their peer group. Taking away their friends like that makes the kids angry and rebellious. Military brats are a good example of this.|`|AA11363993	not really. it makes it hard for children to adjust and make new friends. but some kids adjust more easily then others.|`|2LZJNSnuaa	no because in many aspects its not worth it............. first, they could find it hard to cope, second, their grades could be affected, third, their relationships with people............... it is never a gud idea to move alot wen u have kids................. do it only if its necessary..........|`|GWRP3vLQaa	It depends a lot on the kids. I went to 12 different schools growing up and while I was not very outgoing, I always made friends and did well in school and all through my life. <br>  <br>  Other kids need more stability to do well, and only thrive when there is consistency in their lives. <br>  <br>  I moved around a lot in my younger years, probably a throwback to my upbringing; however, I've been planted where I am for the past 20 years and am enjoying it very much. Still, if times require me to relocate, it won't be the traumatic thing it would be for many.|`|cloASB6paa	No, it creates an unstable environment for the children. I have a friend whose been to 5 different schools in 4 years and she gave up making friends by the last school because she knew she'd be moving soon and she feels as if she doesn't have a home.
Ivg9nEDVaa	Staring is rude, married or not.  However, you can still appreciate beauty.  Don't you appreciate beauty when you see a well painted canvas, or a wonderful bit of nature?  Certainly a human being is no different.  If I see someone who looks good I won't hide my admiration of that person from my wife, but I don't make that person the center of my attention either.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	B,C, and D|`|AnW3dzQfaa	d, but I don't stare just glance.  It's normal and if my husband see's a really hot woman then of course he has the right to look too.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	I don't stare that is so impolite. I do look. This is normal and very natural when you see someone of either the opposite sex or the same sex to simply look "not stare" and maybe even compliment on their attractiveness. Married does not mean one is dead and or blind. To simply admire beauty and or attractiveness is not a crime. If it is an attractive female I may tell my man to look as well. Who cares, I am not insecure and if he wants to go and get someone else oh well, I cannot stop him. And certainly I am not going to spend my life worrying about him looking at another female. That is why God gave us eyes to look and appreciate beauty.|`|oRQQRGlVaa	I would say E) because I would look over at him but not stare at him.  I would just take a look, smile and then continue on what I am doing.  I wouldn't stare, but its only normal to notice a good looking guy, and to take a double look.|`|kxUigIkraa	e) other<br>  <br>  I would look away the instant I noticed that my eyes might want to linger. Whether my husband was with me or not.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	it's normal to look, or we'd all be born blind.<br>  <br>  Yes, and I even would look at those some wouldn't of even looked at twice.  I'm a people watcher|`|3dMfkdxpaa	looking at a good looking person is ok. You don't need to say wow he is hot in front of him.<br>   looking is just that looking.... you are not fantasizing about the person<br>  beauty is to be appreciated.<br>  Everyone sees beauty in someone.<br>  You need to be secure about yourself and you spouse and there wont be any issues about looking|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	I don`t stare...I look, because it is normal to look. Maybe not even look, just glance. If I see someone good looking I think, he`s good looking...but that`s it. I don`t go further with the thought.|`|Yd1la6mLaa	What is wrong with looking at other people? Especially beautiful-looking and handsome people? It is normal to appreciate beauty and its nature!|`|UV27AyIPaa	Yup. I notice good looking men and women, and I look. I don't stare though (that's creepy). There's nothing wrong with appreciating beauty.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	E  When your with some 1 be with them> when alone just because your on a diet doesn't mean you can't look at the menu>|`|0PdYYeBFaa	e) other<br>  <br>  I look but it is just like "oh okay that person is good looking...good on them..best wishes" then i continue with my own business. I feel blessed enough in my marriage.|`|L8J5nNjDaa	i check out other hot people, i dont stare(staring is rude). and i explain to him how sexy he is. sarcastically ;)|`|GPdeHdPOaa	d cause my spouse isn't a jealous freak. seriously it's okay to acknowledge someone else is hot.
FRNesQtkaa	I also am running on a VERY tight budget for my wedding... I know how you feel about wanting to cut costs. <br>  <br>  Have you thought about contacting the local highschool chapter of the National Honor Society or something similar? They would be more reliable and most of those type of groups need community service every semester. Maybe they would be interested in helping clean up afterwards? Maybe you could even make a small donation to their chapter for the help they provide? <br>  <br>  I would try and find someone else to clean up if I could because after the ceremony you are probably going to want to take pictures and stuff right? And then head to the reception... you don't want to have to deal with cleaning up.|`|D9ufwiMXaa	My suggestion would be to go to the local high school and ask to talk to the coach for what ever sport is in season.... you didn't mention when the wedding is...anyhow ask the coach if the team would be interested in making some $ then explain that you need a clean up crew and what you would need them to do and when, and have the wedding party help supervise. Part of the wedding party's job is to help out the happy couple. If the ceremony isn't too big it should take no time at all to clean up.<br>  Also when you pay the team it can be written off as a donation.|`|oMEtUobVaa	Clean up is usually assigned to someone.  At any place you usually have to clean up like the flowers, food and things not tables or chairs and you usually assign a bridesmaid or groomsmen.  But you, like me, sound like you just want everyone to have a good time without worrying about cleaning on your wedding day so you should hire the high school kids.  They'll probably do it if you pay them but they also might expect a lot...who knows.|`|ClsrCKbPaa	I would speak to the local scout groups, ours clean the field After our summer carnival for ￡200 and they all come down and clean it all up - its extra fundrasing for them!|`|AA11380378	Beautiful location<br>  <br>  My two cents: ask the help of your wedding party. The honor to participate includes helping the couple. If it's a small ceremony, picking up will be a breeze.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't leave that responsability to stranger teenagers. Keep your peace of mind and enroll a clean up duty help from your wedding party.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|xFv6LirIaa	That really is a beautiful park.  And thats nice you have an arch to decorate and chairs that come with all this!<br>  <br>  Do you have 5 friends that could set up for you who will not be in the wedding.  People really dont mind helping out like that and you could offer to pay them instead of people you dont even know.  You could write out on a piece of paper exactly where  you want the chairs and they can follow that as a guide.  Have a family member to check it.  And maybe they wouldnt mind cleaning up as well.  Im sure there wont be much trash unless its from flowers or something.<br>  <br>  As far as music, you could hook up a cheap surround sound to a stereo, you can even find them at pawn shops and use it in one of your rooms later on in your house.  But what you can do is put the speakers evenly on either side of the chairs on the outside and cover them somehow with flowers to make them look like decor and the stereo could be at the persons seat that operates it with a remote control, that way with those speakers everyone can hear the music.  Oh and you will have to get some electrical cords to run in there, maybe brown wouldnt be too obvious and tack it down to the ground somehow with a tent pin maybe so people wont trip on it.|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	I think it's a fine idea, to hire children in your neighborhood perhaps and offer to pay after services rendered. That way they have to do the clean up and you can stay in budget. The park does look huge, the lake seems lovely. If you do want to hire high school kids make sure it isn't completely random. Ask friends and family if they know any teenagers willing to do it for xyz bucks. Tell them the time they need to be in the park to clean out and the time they need to be out. Let them know that not only are they getting paid after their services are complete, but if it is not done properly they will have to pay the fines incurred. Of course be nice but stern about it and have witnesses so everyone understands this is a real service and not a favor that can be blown off. If the kids understand they will get paid but have consequences by not following through you should be ok. Good luck! I wish I could get married on my alma mater's campus but UNC charges an arm and leg for such things.|`|sLLgERQWaa	You can't improve on Nature, Hon....so let Nature be your decor....<br>  <br>  Set up your chairs and decorate the aisle side of the chairs (every other one) with ribbon/bows......'Rope' off the first few rows for immediate family by stretching a ribbon across the access to be broken when needed, or use a different color ribbon-people will 'get it'.....a pretty 'reserved for immediate family' plaque will help.<br>  <br>  Where the officiate & the happy couple stand, perhaps a simple three legged plant stand with a beautiful floral arrangement, one on each side so the happy couple are framed by flowers.....if a long tapers can be worked into the arrangement and there is not too much wind, they can be lit for the ceremony.<br>  <br>  The MIL & MOB can have a floral arrangement as a keepsake (means THEY take it down & away, and pulling ribbon/ bows off a few chairs will be no biggie. Perhaps some relatives (guys) will volunteer to fold & put away the chairs.<br>  <br>  As far as the music......do you have a relative or friend with DJ aspirations? Burn a CD with the music you want and use a good portable CD player.....have one CD for the pre-ceremony music, one for the bridal processional, and one for the marriage processional (after the ceremony...mark them or use dif color CDs to tell them apart....bet a teenage relative will be willing to do this for a few bucks.<br>  <br>  Work out the exact way to co-ordinate the music a few days before the rehearsal. At the rehersal you can fine tune it.<br>  <br>  Sometimes less is more and when the setting is so beautiful, go with it.<br>  Good luck.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	The park looks like a beautiful place to have a wedding!  In fact, it reminds me of the park where I'm getting married in September.  We have the same deal as you- our park is owned by the city parks department, so we're getting it for $75 for the whole day, which is a fantastic deal!  However, we too have to be responsible for clean-up and such.  So the way I'm getting around this is simply by having nothing to clean up.  I won't have any flowers there, because I figure we're already at a beautiful outdoor location so floral decor might be overkill.  No decor at all, in fact- we're just going to let the ambience speak for itself.  Also, I don't feel the need for an arch or an aisle runner, because I think the combination of wind plus a pond behind us might make for a bunch of unnecessary headaches if I have a runner or arch.  I think we're going to have our flower girl throw whole daisy heads instead of petals, because it is so much easier to clean up big daisy heads, plus she'll need less of them to scatter since they're bigger.  And it looks really cool.  Our guests are just going to blow bubbles at us instead of throwing rice or birdseed or anything when we make our exit, so there's no cleanup there.  And I've opted not to have programs, fans, water bottles, or anything distracting, annoying, or apt to blow away in the breeze, so we won't have any paper goods to clean up either.  It will all be just very nice, natural, and simple- no muss, no fuss.<br>  <br>  If you really feel you need decorations and such, though, just appoint some slightly distant friends and relatives such as aunts, cousins, etc. to be your cleanup crew.  They can probably take the whole thing down in the 15-30 minutes it takes you to get your pictures taken, so they won't miss anything important from the reception if they hang back a bit.  That way, you're not entrusting anonymous high schoolers with this important task, but your mom, best friends, sisters, etc. don't have to hang back and do it either.  Good luck!|`|pNrfE7fHaa	I think that it will be beautiful!  Wow, I was looking for a place like that for my wedding!  It is wonderful.  <br>  Have the ceremony wherever with chairs set up for people to sit during it, and then have tables set up close by for the reception.  <br>  It will be great!  Good luck!
akIpddDSaa	She looking up to you for god-sake!<br>  Maybe she's a smartass because you don't let her even look up to you!<br>  She growing up, if she needs someone to look up to, or needs a role-model be with her all the way!<br>  Oh and anime isn't for all teenagers! I started watching anime at 7. She's 11 for god's sake, let her listen to anime!<br>  Some anime are for 10 and up!<br>  So just let her be a kid!|`|3BazvY3faa	okay so like i have a older sister and i used to do this to her, yes at first she thought of it as a bad thing but your sister wants to be like you and looks up to you, she'll stop within a year and start being her own person. She just wants to be like you while she is trying to find out who she is.|`|qRzbOMYGaa	It's normal to have your younger sister copy you, mine does it too.  You aren't overreacting, because you want your individuality.  And it isn't cool when people threaten individuality.  She will eventually get out of that stage.  And instead of thinking about it as her copying you, think about it as "She looks up to you and wants to be like you, and she thinks your awesome," and even if she denies that, its true...why else would she copy you?
iTf0l9Wlaa	i say 20 and up anything under is just kinda weird maybe til about 32ish|`|7evN5zIdaa	It's all personal preference. You shouldn't care if it's weird...<br>  Well...I'm 17 and I would date a 26 year old. I think if you're older than 20 you shouldn't date any girl that's younger than 16 (or the legal age for sex). <br>  However, dating a girl 10 years your junior may be up for some criticism so prepare for that, but it's up to you and the girl/guy. If s/he's comfortable, then that's enough<br>  I'm assuming that you're talking about the age range for younger girls...<br>  In terms of older, it really is about personal preference. There's nothing illegal about dating someone significantly older.<br>  So 16 - 99 :P|`|zQheOHReaa	20 and over.|`|WFP46Ek9aa	no more than 5 yrs behind you<br>  21-26 yrs! maybe 26-30|`|7c7e7239a13fa3735f761565b7230571aa	Age doesnt matter only if its under age then its illegal and stay away from cougars (50+).|`|JXrvbW7caa	Date who you want, as long as she is over the age of 18

ch1f8LQCaa	i do think its a form of cheating, i mean afterall you are looking at other naked women, and is it wrong? depends on wife, if she doesnt like it, dont do it, respect her decisions, dont listen to those people that say, if she doesnt want to have sex, you should whatver you want blah blah. and doing it discreetly is still doing and plus it makes it seem like your doing it behind her back (not good) but if shes ok with it (talk it over) then i dont see the problem, i know many women dont mind, but many do, and every husband should respect their wives choice. i for one dont tolerate that junk in my house, i found out my husband would loom at it everyday when i was pregnant with our first, man that broke my heart, i felt so unwanted. but thats over, he moved on from it (i hope) afterall its always the same stuff anyway, just with different people, and backgrounds right? well hope this helped, good luck, and respect her no matter what, afterall she is your wife.|`|sZ1sxdMCaa	1) wife has much lower libido, and not much interested in sex<br>  <br>  Maybe, though it sounds like the wife should make an effort to kick-start her libido.<br>  <br>  2) porn watching is done discreetly<br>  <br>  Sounds like he doesn't want his wife to find out about it, watching porn shouldn't be done in secret.<br>  <br>  3) husband gets relief for his higher libido, and no one else is involved.<br>  <br>  If no one else in involved, then it isn't cheating. But its clear that the wife doesn't please him sexually so he resorts to porn.|`|p9gOEkSPaa	watching porn is not cheating. however it takes years for women / wife to understand that visual fantasy and porn is harmless and its totally normal for the guy to do it. wives usually think of it as an insult thinking that her guy is more attracted to some other women and or she can't satisfy him thats why he's going around watching other women. most wives / gfs cannot understand how much sexual libido men have coz she doesn't have that. you have to make her understand that you are wired differently. you think of sex a whole lot more than her. and watching porn is the most innocent way of expressing your frustration. tell her all guys do it and those who say they don't are just doing it secretly. it depends on her then that she wants you to lie or be open and honest. my husband has a huge porn collection and i'm ok with it now but i was not for the first 2 yrs of marriage coz i couldn't understand why he collects and watches porn.|`|Deb4iqbvaa	Well, ask your wife! And consider this:<br>  <br>  1. Is her libido lower for a reason? Women like to feel appreciated and like to be affectionate; so if you're not thanking her for doing things around the house, she may feel unappreciated.<br>  <br>  I personally don't think watching porn movies is cheating, but there is a lot out there that bothers me personally. For example I don't like my husband going to strip clubs because that's an actual person in front of him, naked; it bothers me but it doesn't bother other women. There's live web-cam porn that I consider cheating because to me it's more personal than watching a video from the porno shop. It all depends on how your wife feels about it.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	no its never ok to look at porn. its not considered cheating but it makes a woman feel very hurt and unloved. your wife should be enough for you and if she's not try talking to her, maybe go see a sex therapist or try to make your love life with your wife work. if you really loved your wife you wouldnt even want to look at porn or even be the slightest curious what else was out there. you would know what you have it better than what any other woman could offer.|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	PORN IS NEVER CHEATING, even under those conditions...

I know many disagree with this, but you work out your problems with the spouse and not resort to cheating or disrespecting your spouse.  <br>  <br>  Porn is inviting a 3rd party into the relationship and it will eventually kill the relationship in the end.  Put more effort in fixing the problems then running away to a fantasy.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	HA! I think sometimes my man wants me to be angry with him for watching porn discreetly.  my philosophy is, if he's not doing it with another woman then its ok with me.

I watch porn too.|`|SNUP0BJ3aa	Listen, I'm a girl and I look at porn on occasion. It has nothing to do with being unfaithful. I have a high libido as well, so I understand where you're coming from.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, porn can easily become an addiction. How often are you looking at it? Do you prefer porn over sex with your wife? I think the details determine whether it's a problem or not. I think for some women, porn creates insecurity. They may feel as though if you are seeing perfect bodies and great sex via videos, you're in your own fantasy world and not engaging with her. That she cant live up to those pornstars, etc. This might actually make her feel slighted or uncomfortable having sex with you as frequent if it truly bothers her.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think an occasion porn session is okay. But I'm also a female, so I can see how it may be veiwed as a problem as well. Don't let the habit get out of hands. Respect her feelings too. Let your wife know how much you love her, that sex with her is amazing. compliment her. And hey, maybe you could try watching it together sometime?|`|elhcuN19aa	Married and looking at it yes!<br>  it is not better than a wife having an emotional fling with a guy on the internet technically<br>  <br>  In the bible it would be considered immoral<br>  Paul said for a husband and wife to not deny sex so sexual temptation will be kept lower.....but the temptation would still be there but we all have to do our part and resist stuff|`|2d8879147618190440919438922e8a7eaa	I don't mind that my hubby watches porn.  i mind if he lies about it cause then the wheels in my insecure little head start turning.

5SCD87hTaa	i will admit i haev done the same thing with fishing. i will go out with my friends about twice a year on a fishing trip on Lake Erie. though i tel my wife when i am going i usually forget to give her all the details. <br>  <br>  first off i would not worry when i guy is planning a trip with his friends his wife is the last thing he will think about. he is to busy thinking about how fun it will be to get out of the house, away from work just to take a relaxing weekend on a boat away from it all, (in your husbands case the green). if you ask him where he is staying at he will tell you. if you do ask him though he will think you dont trust him but there is not a way around that if you need to know. you cna try to trick him into telling you but asking how his day was later tonight. Phrase questions like "So what course did you guys go to?" or as how is the hotel. If you get the name of the gold course he was on you can get the city he is in by searching it on google. <br>  <br>  now if you really want to know and you dont want him to know. call your credit card company and ask them for a listing of the most recent places your husbands card was used. they will tell you over the phone the places that your husband used the card, ie. the hotel he is staying in and where he is eating. a simple google search can also tell you what course he is probably at. jsut tell the card company that you are checking to make sure there are not fraudulent charges on the card. he will never know your friends will never know just you. <br>  <br>  now if i was your husband i would want you to just ask the next time you talk. good husbands dont mind too much if you need to check up on them once and a while, just dont call him when hes on the green at the 18th hole LOL.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Put your mind at ease and call that other wife and find out where he is. At the very least , ask other wife to call her hubby and explain to your hubby what is going on. Good luck and have a nice day!|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	If hes your husband and you have kids together he should have called and told you where he was. I would be upset that he hasent called or even told you where he was before he left.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	If there is an emergency at least you can call the wife and find out.  Otherwise just wait until he calls again and ask.  It is not all that weird, I dont think?????|`|v3DlrlPTaa	if you now the area where he is staying then you can call around and find him|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	Oops, "Brokeback Mountain!"|`|sxahupRTaa	Yup...sounds sketchy. Check into it.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	What is weird, that he called you to see how you & the kids were doing?  That he called in the morning or mid-day isn't weird, especially if he figures he will be busy in the evening and might not have enough time to talk with you later.  <br>  <br>  As to not giving you the address of where he was staying, he is likely being a clueless guy.  If my wife didn't "ask" there would be times I'd forget to let her know where I was staying (thinking that if she needed to call me that she has my cell phone) and I've never once cheated on my wife (or hoped an opportunity to do so would open up).<br>  <br>  Do you guys NOT have cell phones? It is 2009, just about everyone else does.  Pick up the phone and ask him where he is staying if it bothers you.  If for some reason you don't have a cell phone, wait until next time he calls and ask him for the information.  You can also call the other wife and simply make an excuse "Oh, hello Marry this is Debbie.  Mark gave me his hotel information but I misplaced it and need to speak to him.  Is there anyway I could get the information from you?"|`|24cb37f7fb9c4bf1d5c91252b52e4ab9aa	It is awfully suspicious.<br>  <br>  I would question it.|`|rqH8mAM2aa	I'M GOING TO THE CORNER STORE TO GET A PACK OF CIGARETTES!!!!!!!!!|`|0rAgtGNgaa	maybe it just slipped his mind. Its happened to me before when I was babysitting while the kids parents were out of town and they forgot to tell me where they were staying luckily the grandma knew in case there was an emergency.<br>  <br>  Call the other guys wife and ask her where they are staying.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	If you know the wife of one of the guys he's going with, then just call her and ask her where they are staying.  Its weird in a way though that he doesn't tell you himself.  I don't think there's anything going on necessarily but its just common courtesy for him to tell you where he's going in case there's an emergency.  My husband prints out his itinerary and gives it to me so I know where he is staying and the number of the hotel.  He also calls me to give me the room number that he is in.|`|AA10911598	This trip sounds suspicious.  If an emergency was to occur you would need to contact him so you do need to know his location.  I would call and inquire about this very soon.  In the future he needs to provide more information about his plans.  He would expect the same from you.  What is you went away with your female friends for a weekend.  Who would care for the kids and would you be able to go without providing details about your plans?  I bet not.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	If he called this morning why didn't you just ask him where he was staying?  It's really not a big deal unless you have a rocky marriage and are concerned about him cheating.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Leave him alone and let him have his outlet.<br>  <br>  If he wants to check in, he will.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, don't worry.
B462BQYzaa	you think too much - just cuz u stopped chatting doesn't mean u're a person that no one wants to talk to - it's more of what were you guys talking about maybe it doesn't interest that person, maybe that person is busy, etc there are so many factors that come into play<br>  <br>  you give me the impression that you are someone who sees a cup half empty rather than half full, more of a pessimist than an optimist, this can really affect where you are headed in life.|`|AA12034267	Perhaps he got busy.

What do you do for an encore throw yourself on the floor and cry|`|DIj072Sqaa	I happens all the time on YM. People chat then go quiet. It's not being rude just that they're busy or distracted. You can always message 'still there, sorry I had a phone call' or something like that.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	yes, you're a drama QUEEN. lol<br>  let it go
7ot3Rqgpaa	You asked a lot of questions so my answer will probably jump around a lot. But I think that your uncles are mad because it seems that after your granma passed away, they were his main focus. He took care of them, gave them money and didn't ask for anything in return. Now your granpop has moved on with what seems to be from your description a very nice lady. I think that your mom and uncles are a little jealous that your granpop's life is no longer all about them. That and no matter how old you are when a parent dies and the other moves on, there will be some resentment and the feeling that the surviving parent is "cheating" or disrespecting the other. Which isn't true. After someone close to dies, people sometimes do things that are so selfish. "If I'm not happy why should Granpa?" They would probably never say this but deep down that maybe how they feel.<br>  <br>  As for you living off of your grandpop, I think that's crazy. You were welcomed to live there with them. If you're happy and your grandpop and his fiancee are happy with you being there, that should be all that matters. Your mom should glad that you're not only back in school but also doing very well (congrats btw)<br>  <br>  I think that your mom maybe a little mad at you for not being on her side, which is wrong. You're not being brainwashed. As I said if you're happy with things and things are going better for you, your mom should be happy with that. <br>  <br>  Lastly, like I said, it seems like your granmom and granpop have dedicated their lives to helping their kids. So it's a shock that he is now doing something for himself that makes him happy. I hope I answered all your questions, Good luck!|`|AA11789493	Well, God bless you first off and you have to recognize that this is not a child problem, but an adult problem and their behavior is disrespectful and unacceptable.  I don't really know why they are acting this way, but you did not cause this so don'tlet it drag you down--you've done nothing wrong.  I think they see your Granpa's fiance and you as a threat to their "inheritance" and don't like it that you and your Grandparents love/loved each other so much and they are such a mess.  Stop trying to fix this because it cannot be fixed.  You can love and respect your mom and family but you don't have to take their crap.  I wouldn't argue with them or anything like that, but just turn them off in your head when they start in, or say you have some place to go or something to do when they start in.  Most of all, don't take this stuff to heart because by doing so they are killing your spirit and your rightful joy for life.  In a few more years you'll have more freedom to do what you want and be away from them and out of their control.  Keep your eye on the prize, which is your future.  Your job right now is to study very hard in school and do your very, very best and you can make it be in honor of your Grandma.  Start thinking about what you'd like to do "when you grow up."  Do you want a trade like an electrician or plumber or do you want to go to college.  Once you have a general idea, talk to your counselor at school and ask for guidance.  You can also make an appointment with your guidance counselor to talk about your grief and how to deal with it.  Like my little Granson says, "she makes you feel better."  Bottom line--you can only control yourself and how you feel and react to adverse situations.  You can't change anybody but yourself.  Keep a positive attitude.  Pray to God for strength and guidance and talk to your Grandma because her spirit is all around you.  If nothing else, say, "God please help me."|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Your grandpa is several times blessed... he had a wonderful wife that he looked after to the very end, and now has a new woman to look after him, AND a wonderful grandson.<br>  <br>  Your other family members are really abusive control freaks... and they are mooches. They apparently want an inheritance... so they wanted grandpa to die off pretty quick. Grandpa's new wife would inherit everything and they know it.<br>  These are the kind of people that will hire a prostitute doctor to arbitrarily declare him incompetent and file the Baker Act on him out of sheer greed.<br>  <br>  When the other family members call, you say "everything is fine" and time them out at about 5 minutes, then make any excuse to get off the line... and instruct your grandpa likewise. Start screening calls with the answering machine. Neither you nor he has to take any guff off of them.|`|LrxTy3zLaa	No one deserves to be alone if they are in need of companionship.<br>  <br>  Your grandfather's feelings for another woman do not lessen the love he will always have for your grandmother.<br>  There is no reason for your family to be angry with him... they should rejoice in the fact that he was able to find love not just once, but twice in his lifetime.<br>  Some people do not find it even the one time.<br>  <br>  Your grandfather is doing exactly as your grandmother asked. It is the ones who disapprove who are not respecting her wishes. ;)

xrQQ9Zuyaa	I am in my fifties, and I would want to hear it if it meant having a real conversation with my kid about things that mattered to them. I would not be surprised to find some of our values and judgements were different. I say it is worth a try. Try saying 'Some of the things you say sound old fashioned to me' That is a better approach than 'You are old fashioned'|`|zTKRV3WJaa	The only way to let them know is by telling them. You can't help how you really feel, and you shouldn't be afraid to let them know. Maybe if you tell them they'll know and realize how you feel about them.

m3ztkSr4aa	It does seem like the cost of weddings has gotten worse between hidden fees like food and drink minimums and outrageous site rental fees. But there are ways to have a wedding that doesn't cost that much. I am planning a wedding right now on Catalina Island in Southern California and it is going to end up being between 8,000 and 10,000.|`|lpeHQj3aaa	Because the wedding industry and the media uses propaganda and brainwashing so the younger couples will spend thousands and thousands of hard earned money to have that so-called "perfect" wedding. <br>  <br>  Perfect wedding is relative. What is meaningful to the couple, even if it cost a so little is considered perfect. For some, perfection means expensive.<br>  <br>  And the problem is with most brides nowadays, it's becoming a sort of competition. Let's be honest, there are some brides here who wants to have a "better' wedding than someone she knows. <br>   Weddings have become a perfect opportunity for parents to brag and couples to show-off, people can get carried away and before we know it, another set of "perfect" standards for weddings has been established, that is more perfect that the last one - and naturally more expensive.<br>  <br>  It becomes a vicious cycle that 20 years from now, my children will pay 5 times more for a so called "perfect" wedding.|`|giocJLVKaa	I think weddings are so expensive because people want to make a huge show of things and get carried away.  Often times I think people assume that they can't get away with the less expensive alternative to something because someone might notice the difference or may think that it is "tacky".  My though is that if you like it, it doesn't matter what other people think.  <br>  <br>  The price can be cut significantly in many ways such as having an outdoor wedding instead of an in door one, have it in the middle of the week instead of on the weekend, shop around for prices before making decision, etc.<br>  <br>  I won't be spending much more than $800 or so on everything for my wedding (30-60 people) and it will be better than "decent".  Besides, is it really about the things you have for one day, or the marriage and the time spent with those you care about celebrating it?|`|AA11562326	I guess when expectations are set high, when things must be done a certain way, that's when it gets expensive.  When I look at the weddings of my parents, or grandparents, or even our own wedding 20 years ago, they seem cheap compared to what some people do today.<br>  <br>  We didn't hire a videographer for our wedding.  People do, today, or at least they hire professional photographers.<br>  <br>  The food for my parents' wedding was sort of like a church potluck, under a big tent.  No rented restaurant, no caterer.<br>  <br>  In my grandparents' day, they just had good friends make the food, and the wedding was at somebody's house.  Not even a church to schedule.<br>  <br>  My former pastor used to say, "No one should go into debt for a wedding."  I think that's actually pretty good advice, because one would not want to burden a new marriage for months or years, for the sake of one day.  We had saved up enough to pay cash for our wedding (got married at 31), but would not go beyond that.|`|29I8PWrxaa	I agree with Amanda - a wedding need not be expensive to be decent.  But the reason they can get expensive is because things add up quick.  Flowers are pricey ... feeding a large number of guests can be pricey, especially when you feed them fancy food as many weddings do ... if you pay for the alcohol that adds up quick ... another $500 or $1000 here and there for things like a DJ, photographer, dress, rings, decorations, etc.  It all adds up fast!  Of course none of these things are necessary or mandatory for a wedding, but they are traditional.  My fiance and I are spending under $8000 but still doing it the way we want.|`|AA11172374	It doesn't have to be.  Everyone seems to spend a lot of money<br>  that does't need to be spent on "stuff" that really doesn't matter.<br>  Are you any less married if you don't have 6 bridesmaids, or thousands<br>  of flowers, or a huge cake, or hundreds of guests?  No.  In the big<br>  scheme of things, do any of those things really matter?  In other words,<br>  if something happened and, say, your flowers weren't delivered, or<br>  the caterer didn't show up, would you go ahead and get married anyway, or cancel the whole thing?  You just need to figure out<br>  what your priorities are.  In my case, I would have gotten married<br>  to my hubby if it was just the 2 of us, eloping, or at a justice of the<br>  peace.  None of the "stuff" that goes along with it mattered to us.<br>  We ended up with a tiny wedding with just family members (14 guests)<br>  not because we couldn't afford anything else, but because the rest <br>  of the stuff just didn't matter that much to us.   We decided that all the<br>  days that came after our wedding day were more important to us than<br>  the wedding itself.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	because it's (at least in theory) a once in a lifetime event, and people are willing to pay for it.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	A wedding does not have to expensive for it to be "decent".|`|SSHBAFb5aa	It is almost impossible to have a decent wedding for "cheap"...<br>  <br>  I am trying to have a "decent" wedding at the cheapest price I can. I am not doing flowers, we are not getting a photographer, we have no groomsmen or bridesmaids because we don't want to label our friends, my dress is $300, we are having a cocktail reception instead of a traditional sit down, we are getting married at our first-kiss spot which is in a park (and its just to exchange vows and nothing more). I am printing my own invitations! The list could go on and on....this will all still cost $3000 because it is impossible to feed people for less than $1500, in Denver at least. Then you add in officiant costs, and the little costs here and there that just keep making the totals go up and up. Add a honeymoon and some rings to it and we are at $6000. We totally cannot afford any of it. <br>  I wish you all the luck in the world and I totally understand your frustration.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I had my dream wedding for $5000.  It was more than decent.|`|AA10975867	What do you consider to be a decent wedding? If there is a bride and a groom and they are in love, any wedding is decent. When costs for receptions get way out of control it is generally because the bride has visions of herself being a movie star and living in a fantasy world, or the parents are loaded and want to impress everyone. If there is love and the people who are close to you are present, a ceremony in your home with nice dinner for family can be perfect.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	A decent wedding does not have to be expensive if you shop around for good deals.

Which is absolutely not true.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	so far (including the church, cake, reception etc, and the dress) is about $1300 so far.

He misses you, but what he really misses is sex or possible sex. The main reason young guys in military holds onto these long distance relationships is because they want someone being there for them when they need some. I been through it and seen it in so many young men.<br>  <br>  my suggestion is to focus on your own life and please don't revolve your world around him.|`|BPqK0c5taa	I think he misses you and can't wait to see you again.

But give it another shot.|`|chENztVEaa	Just to keep you hanging just in case.....are you sure he thought you were his "girl" or did he possibly just think you were dating?  If the two of you didn't set it in stone that you were a couple than he really didn't do anything wrong.  Plus if you have only been together three months and were that far apart I can't imagine why you would be arguing, red flag, red flag, red flag, People usually get along for awhile before they start disagreeing, especially in a long distance relationship.  What are his plans after he gets out of the military?  He may have realized onvce he is out there might be more distance there due to a move and figured it just wouldn't work for a serious relationship and thought he would put some space between the two of you to keep from hurting your feelings.  Communication is the key, here.  Good luck.|`|w7g4eGqFaa	well like he said HE MISSSES YOU<br>  and he prolly just wants to know what youve been up to.<br>  anddd if anythign he wants to try and get you back.<br>  girl if you still love him your not gun loose anything if youuu get back with him right? give him anotehr chance if thats what hes asking for(:|`|pXpOXRnDaa	It's difficult to small talk just to stay in touch. I think it gets old quick. Also, I just got out of the military. There is an emotional ride to separating from that lifestyle. He might be looking for some stability and venting. It's too early to tell if he is looking for a relationship.|`|UjC2vaqLaa	maybe he wants some poonanny|`|gVyCFrPvaa	he just wants to get laid....ignore him|`|Ks1uiHReaa	it means what it says he misses u|`|7evN5zIdaa	I wouldn't read too much into it.<br>  It may mean that he wants to get back together.<br>  But maybe he just misses you. End of. I miss my friends when I haven't heard from them in a while. Maybe he does want to start your long distance thing again, but you can't figure that out from 4 texts unless one of them said "Let's start up again"|`|gd5XGTakaa	i think he realizes he is missing out on something good... he really truelly misses you... if he is getting out of the military soon then maybe there is a chance that this relationship won't be long distance anymore and he recognizes that as an opprotunity to live with you and get closer... he does miss you and i think he wants you back|`|kZxnV1sHaa	Maybe, he still wants to be friends and end it on a friendly note. There are a lot of relationships that end friendly, I am sure you have heard this already, but long distance is hard. When you are not face to face everyday or at least talking, it would put a strain on any relationship. If this relationship was meant to be, he might show up when he gets out of the Military. Good Luck, I hope that something works for you.
drBgy7bAaa	I think she was upset because she relized that she had made a mistake, and now has to live the rest of her life dealing with that.|`|vR4k5iVCaa	i understand you still love her and that's sweet. you did the right thing by mailing her stuff to her.maybe deep down inside she still has feelings for you to but because she married she can' bring them out. but knowing that you still have feelings for her makes her happy because she knows if ever her marriage don't work out your there for her to run back to, now because you mailed her stuff back to her she thinks you are over her and it's her turn to hurt. she's just using anger to replace her hurt and her sister is just butting in where she doesn't belong|`|63ff74d8b74029f44c5d4403dc78e14aaa	Dude you just lost your chance for a little on the side. She wanted to keep that stuff there so she'd have a reason to "drop by one day."|`|Em5PSrUgaa	While I can sort of understand her "moving on" after being w/ you for 3 yrs and there being no marriage proposal,(obviously getting married was important to her), I agree w/ you that she should have then forgotten about you and lived happily ever after w/ her new guy. <br>  Since she is calling, e-mailing, and loosing all her cool over you mailing some of her old stuff to her parents, she needs to just admit that either she really still hates you for some reason, or she really still loves you for some reason, or it could be both. Either way, she's not over whatever happened between the two of you and she's not accepting the choice she made there after to be with someone else.<br>  Basically, she's not happy and it still has to do w/ you somehow. Until she can grow up and discuss this w/ either you or her husband what's going on w/ her, and stop calling friends and family to help her create drama and confusion, then that's what there will be. Drama and confusion. And you would know better then anyone if that's not maybe just what she wants.
AnW3dzQfaa	I love cooking and being naked so that's no big deal for me and we have a dishwasher so piece of cake!|`|kEtYEmhqaa	those don't come even close to what I do for her.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	If you really loved your spouse, you would read the book The Five Love Languages and learn to speak theirs.<br>  <br>  Those are all "acts of service" and only speak love to a person if that is their love language.<br>  <br>  These are the love languages:<br>  Touch<br>  Words of Affection<br>  Acts of Service<br>  Quality Time<br>  Gifts<br>  <br>  My love needs would not be met by those things, but they are all nice.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	i don't believe in any of those. Just because you love your spouse doesn't mean you have to cook daily or be naked or even make an already crappy day even crappier by doing dishes.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Actions speak louder than words, so yes, all of the above and more.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	maybe on his birthday.|`|RfKAIPscaa	if you really loved your spouse you would...?<br>  <br>  NOT screw your wife's bet friend's boss!!!

c35nYEQraa	fist off- calm down.<br>  life will move on, and things like this won't matter when you grow up.<br>  but i know how it feels- right now its tough.<br>  and i'm gonna tell you to do some hard things, but you've gotta have the courage to do them if you want this fixed.<br>  go to taylor. talk to her. don't be all mad at her, but be firm about it- yet kind to her. let her know you're not going to hurt her.<br>  do you know why she's doing this to you??<br>  she's insecure about herself, and probably sees you as competition to get the guy that she wants.<br>  but talk to her, make her understand that this is NOT ok, and that if she doesn't stop it, and fix the rumors that have been done, you will take the next step.<br>  which is not making it bad for her, by the way-- its going to an adult. one that can interfere adn make it better.<br>  don't go trying to get revenge at her, because that will only make it worse-- trust me, i know!<br>  but if you talk to her, it'll work out. let her know that you're not trying to steal any guys from her or anything. tell her that she can have them, you aren't trying to be competition- they're just your friends. <br>  and technically, at this age, that is all they should be!!-- althought the world states differently.<br>  make sure she doesn't fell threatended or scared.<br>  if the bullying goes far enough that it is really hurting you-- you MUST let an adult know. RIGHT AWAY.<br>  school councelor, parent, parent of a friend, close friend that is an adult, teacher, principal, ETC.!! someone who can step in and help out.<br>  hope this helps!!<br>  good luck!!|`|jQSFMcNfaa	Since your friends don't believe the jerk then tell them to tell the people  that do that everything she's saying is a lie. Or ask them to ignore the female cow. When she comes around just pretend like she's just air and walk right through her. Tell them that she's just trying to find a way to entertain herself and the only way that U can make it any worst is by giving into what she wants. Hey, the world doesn't revolve around her and her little "games" so she needs to get over herself and have some one put her in her place. Seriously what she's doing is so 5th grade.

287be9eed813282b97683e4edde034f8aa	I agree, you need to look in the mirror.  What exactly are you expecting?  Don't expect anything and you won't be disappointed.<br>  <br>  I, as a grandmother, cannot understand not wanting to see my grandchildren every moment I can.  BUT, some grandparents only see their grandchildren a couple times a year.   Due to various reasons. Why can't you focus on the positive  with all the grandparents.  When they choose to visit make it a good happy experience.  <br>  <br>  I too wonder what you are doing to make all them not feel welcome.  I just get an underlying feeling of uneasiness about your parenting skill.  Sorry.  Just reading some  of your other questions really makes me think.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Because your 7 year old still has a pacifier and Goodnights.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	You can get restraining orders against people so that they must stay away or get arrested.<br>  It would be a big hint that you won't take it anymore.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	I do not intend to be trite here, however, have you and your husband honestly looked at your contributions to this problem? If it were only one out an three in, I would be more likely to accept that the one is the problem, but when it is three out and one in, it may be time to examine yourselves. God bless.|`|0GqYeMVWaa	isnt it a shame we cant pick our families.i dont get along at all with my mother in law and shes real flighty too..i havnt seen her(and it was my hubbies choice) since b4 my daughter was born...shes 13 yrs old.my daughter hasnt missed out on anything.she has another set of grandparents that are good.and if she didnt ,well its just life.i know many people who dont have grandparents or even parents and they are perfectly normal.just dont put up with crap from these people,treat them like they treat you.you and your husband are your family now.just dont be like them when you have grankids.some people you cant get thru to.enjoy ure own life like they are enjoying theirs !
hHjPFxEdaa	Size queens ARE called shallow and yes you sound just like she described you.|`|goP5E0Kxaa	No **** you are fool you date women for a physical trait , and not personality , chemistry .

Lmao|`|LcOPL8gCaa	You seem very shallow for the way you write this, you also seem very young. Or at least middle school. <br>  I believe you are shallow, just because someone isn't bigger in the breast, doesn't mean you cant love her.<br>  <br>  If some guy wanted to date me only because of my body type & not the real me, I'd call him a shallow jerk +. I'd prob slap him. Or better yet kick him in his balls.<br>  <br>  Congrats!<br>  Your Shallow!|`|gd5XGTakaa	i think its pretty shallow only giving girls a chance if they have big knockers... the other goodlooking ones that lack in the chest maybe make up for it in the ***.... but looks aren't everything... what is the point on passing up the girl you might fall totally in love with just cuz her boobs aren't like quadruple D|`|qsXR5GRBaa	You are not only shallow, but could really stand to grow up.  There is so much more to a relationship than just physical attraction that you don't realize what you are missing.  If you don't grow up you just may end up with a large breasted woman who is just as shallow as you.|`|zS3r0ko0aa	There is nothing wrong with preferring girls who have big boobs and continue you to chase the girls if you want. But you should never dismiss a girl who may appear out of the blue just because she has small breasts. Give her a chance|`|4O9FsO3Xaa	sorry dude...but yeah ur really shallow.<br>  just because her **** are not as big as u would like doesnt mean that she wouldnt be a everything else that u could fall for, or like. <br>  and girls are just as shallow if they size queens!|`|w7g4eGqFaa	HAHAHH,<br>  srry to say but you are hellaa shallow.<br>  cuhs honestly grls with small breast can offer more than girls with bigger ones(;|`|YIeXrfBKaa	Yes, you are being shallow.|`|NxZl1Qccaa	you are shallow.|`|7evN5zIdaa	It does sound a bit shallow, but we can't really help who we fancy. I have trouble dating anyone shorter or younger than me so I guess that's similar..<br>  However, I date people for more reasons than looks. If I can talk to a 16 year old and he makes me laugh even if he is shorter than me, then I will still date him.<br>  Maybe you have to consider whether you're being to hasty in dropping these girls. They may not have large breasts but you may find yourself finding other qualities you like through dating these girls.|`|EMiozFH3aa	Dude listen to me. Do not like a girl just for her breasts. you should like the girl for who she is. you can have just as much fun with a girl with smaller breasts as you can with a girl with large ones. physical body does not mean anything about the girl. That is really shallow dude.|`|CGlDAvkAaa	Big breasts sag baby. Didn't you ever hear that more than a handful is a waste anyway. It really is. Besides girls with big boobs have a hard time wearing certain clothes. They look good but they are certainly not practical<br>  Give the small breasted girl a chance, you might find that breasts don't matter at all|`|mqjZtssGaa	No, that isnt shallow , just you.<br>  and if small breast just dont attract you , then theres nothing you can do.<br>  you can't date someone you are not somewhat physically atracted to.|`|ZjOcQgHzaa	lol I don't think you are completely shallow, we all have our standards.<br>  Just know, that one of these days, them boobies are gonna sag to the floor.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  haha.|`|UjC2vaqLaa	just tell her to get some implants|`|gVyCFrPvaa	yes....you're shallow

You should definitely use it as your profile pic or something :) You shouldn't lose any weight for him.  If he would ask you that, he's rude and a pig. It's your body. He shouldn't be saying that to you--especially if he knows it makes you insecure.  I think if you lose more weight you'll be too skinny.  Maybe then he'll complain about how bony you are and ask you to gain weight.  Tell him you don't like it when he tells you that and that you hope he likes you for more than your looks. Good luck!|`|hiJ6yKhkaa	i think youll be the perfect weight if you just eat healthier, which doesn't mean a diet or counting calories, it just means read the ingredients on the the box, stay away from hydrogenated oils, high fructose corn syrup or corn syrup, MSG or monosodium glutamate, and aspartame, as those all lead to weight gain and the last two are excitotoxins, which once ingested they excite the cells in your brain so much that it excites them to death and eventually deteriorates your central nervous system. <br>  <br>  to learn more go to mudutu.com!|`|ArYmxy7Taa	idk bout your views of religion, but your body is a temple, so everything you put into it depicts whether or not you take care of it. but girl, you look great! you're clearly taking care of your temple. and if he keeps puttin you down like that, go out and find another man that will treat you like a princess!|`|gZnDHz6Daa	are you fishing for compliments ?<br>  girl haha yur not fat at all.<br>  yur perfect.<br>  yur not skinny minny though.<br>  and dont try and be it.<br>  im skinny( i mean skinny !) and HATE IT !<br>  i want to be tht size, yur size, its so perfect.<br>  and yur bf is weird. ahha.<br>  btw; i fish for compliments too.<br>  my bf doesnt give me enuff, hes a good guy tho.<br>  much love<3|`|LT9BZmLNaa	Oh my god, that assWHOLE! are you serious? you should dump him, you are not fat you are gorgeous.

1fGoHDOpaa	I'm a girl and it sounds like she still wants to date u. But what did you break up of?

You both know each other better as friends as you really were not hiding your true selves  as dating couples do. <br>  I married my best friend 30 years ago.  So go out with her and talk about both of your feelings to see what should happen next. Obviously her current boyfreind would need to go away to move forward.|`|3swZV9uUaa	just be honest to her and dont in a rude way just say you still want to be friends and that you still want to hang around you dont have to face the fact about everything....

CpJnhy1saa	This is not a healthy relationship. You deserve better than this. My husband does not take things out on me when he's mad or frustrated. When things go wrong, we argue about the problem without blame or name calling. He has never once put me down. We've been married 31 years. He respects me even when we disagree. That's key. I don't think you feel respected. I'd move on if I were you.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	The key here is that you've split and reunited three times.  This relationship is not good or healthy.  <br>  <br>  He does not appear to treat you well.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	And what exactly is it that you are getting out of this relationship? Surely you can't be enjoying this kind of treatment.  You have broke up 3 times in the past and nothing changes so why are you even considering going back to him again?  Don't you actually think you would be better off if you let this one go and learn from it?  I do.  <br>  Red|`|p6QizgmRaa	After 3 rounds of this relationship, you really shouldn't have to question whether or not it is a good relationship OR if he is treating you properly. You know the answer.|`|AA11603529	Honestly, he just sounds like a dick. Taking your anger out on someone, especially someone you claim to love, is never the right thing to do. You need to confront him and tell him you aren't his punching bag.|`|vj93MNjBaa	Uhhh do you realyl have to ask?|`|XlhBBZPxaa	sounds like you were a door mat for him GET OUT and stay OUT|`|dIw7MqTdaa	He's either angry about your past or his -- likely yours, though. Ask him about it. Either way, don't mean to sound hypocritical, but you need to ask forgiveness if this really is the case. Otherwise, you're going to be dealing with a lot of hostility that will result in another breakup and possibly even abuse.|`|GoGaYHDyaa	Shut up women do it worse to men!!|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Don't get back together with him again! He's not worthy! He has anger issues and definitely doesn't know how to love and respect a woman. Actions and words speak volumes....and he's already made it clear that he can live with or without you...now you need to believe in yourself enough to know you can live without him!!!!
LtlBILW1aa	hahhaha<br>  good one<br>  its ok<br>  this things happen you<br>  should<br>  just laugh and keep it to your self do you know what i mean?<br>  lmao lol<br>  pretty funny <br>  good luck!|`|jhjn1QVQaa	It was a little rude, I'm sure she wasn't aware of the smell.  Perhaps you could have offered her the gum, and if she declined, then you simply cut the conversation short.  Or, you can just be honest and tell her she stinks, but that would be a little embarrassing for the both of you.  What's done is done, right?|`|zQheOHReaa	that made me LOL. if that were me i'd get some gum for myself, and nicely offer her some gum as well.|`|e62f95518e0bb700635945c8033d6bceaa	I would have decked you.|`|gU8pP7d5aa	you go girl|`|bNuuxJv1aa	I would probably told you that you could have just told me that my breath was smelling bad and then I would have went and took care of the situation.
h6NqNzHAaa	She is an ex for a reason.|`|lNiv7Cupaa	She broke up with you becayse she was getting attention elsewhere then that dried up she because emotional etc, you looked after her, it was all nice, two months later some other attention came her way and now your the peice of crap again, it will keep happening until you cut ties altogether!
eGpOIV12aa	try to kiss him. see how he reacts
DyuXD9Evaa	well i dont personally believe that forgiveness and liberal are one in the same...i dont believe obama is the antichrist but i also didnt vote for him...the problem i can see is that she probably hates the fact that you guys have had sex...and in that she is trying to repent and avoid temptation...do i agree with her choice? yes and no...it isnt entirely fair to you but you have to see her side of it...she is trying to better herself and it seems kinda like she really just put you guys on pause...i dont think she should have dumped you but early on in my relationship my gf told me a similar story and for two weeks we didnt see each other or talk to give her a chance to get right with God...and it seems obvious that you dont support her in her beliefs so what do you expect?
fRIEHBJOaa	he cheated while you were there!!?? what a jerk. F him and F that skank boss. they obviously got a thrill on the fact that they can get caught...well, i think they'll find some more thrills while waiting on the unemployment line.  karma b*tches.<br>  <br>  ps. people can only DREAM about such justice....you're lucky.|`|AA10911598	I like holding people accountable for their actions.  Your cheating husband is lucky that all he  got was fired.  He deserves what happens to him now. He lost a good woman so he can now skirt around with others.  You should be proud for standing up for yourself and not allowing him to hurt you more.  Find a more deserving man to fulfill your happiness now.|`|5hxWSezPaa	Sounds like YOU really screwed up.  You wanted to get him fired.  Now you have an unemployed cheating husband.  You should have handled the situation with tact.|`|34b40Vu3aa	Sounds like you took the time to prepare yourself for this kind of situation by saving up money I wouldn't care either.  I would have done the same thing.|`|NGKwsawdaa	Nope, him and the manager deserved it.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I think you should fire him.|`|BO28Mn8haa	FU*K what the men are saying on here. Good for you!!! Now go on and find a real man!|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	no it was fine|`|vyU59X7zaa	Well if you are going to get a divorce with the man, no harm done.<br>  <br>  That's what he deserves, anyway. <br>  And it's also against most job policy to have a relationship with someone of higher ranking, so that's his fault for breaking the rules, and his managers.|`|AA10529198	Hey !!! You gotta do what you gotta do !!!<br>  <br>  But, think about it.. who got over on who(m) ?  He got over on you, because he was having sex with his manager, and then coming home and having sex with you !!! So Psyche !|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	so you have a boyfriend who is spying on your cheating husband? Sounds like you are being slightly hypocritical, if you have a boyfriend while still married to someone else.|`|eXg6sLnaaa	KUDOS!!!! Good for you!!! I don't think you should be second guessing how you reacted.  You were angry, and at that exact moment, you did exactly what you thought you should have.  And I am soo happy you did!!!  They got what they deserved!|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	I remember your question from before....about wondering if he was cheating or not since your bf saw him come out of his bosses office with a messed up shirt, looking embarrassed. Sorry this was the outcome, but......<br>  GOOD FOR YOU!!!!! HE DESERVES IT AND MORE!!!! SO DOES SHE!!!!!!|`|fLU63N4kaa	Well done! You kicked *** xD But honestly you shouldn't have forgiven him the first time, once a cheater always a cheater.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you've got him fired, now dump his lowlife ***. That'll teach him!|`|aSZyseRGaa	Girl he cheated on you that's as low as it gets. I think it's funny he got caught you should not feel one ounce of guilt it was his own fault.|`|vj93MNjBaa	Wow, you blamed the manager and not your husband when you caught them half naked?<br>  <br>  LOL!<br>  <br>  Very sad.|`|TSmego9vaa	Good for you leave his ***. Once a cheater always a cheater. I hope you got his boss in trouble too. lol Divorce his ***.|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	Nope, you should be proud that you caught him AND got revenge ALL AT ONCE. Just don't linger and move on ASAP!|`|Rez6KpoNaa	he may need some serious help taking a risk like that at work God Bless You Both|`|dnFjdJ72aa	maybe not|`|0Id85yiYaa	good for you dear! you did the right thing|`|tCiVuFK9aa	Well, it wasn't very classy.  Besides, how does it benefit you that he now has no income? Did you know that he can ask for alimony.  Now wouldn't that be injustice if he asked for alimony and got it.  I think you would have been better off to acknowledge to him that he was caught and then leave.  As it is, you have just given the whole office something to talk about.  Good for you dumping him though.  <br>  Red|`|GvamTVqAaa	Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.<br>  <br>  I really don't blame you, but if you have kids it may be a while before you see any child support with him being jobless and all :)|`|0rAgtGNgaa	I think you did the right thing.  You need to find you another man instead of a habitual cheater.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	way to go.|`|0AShsMsoaa	very entertaining fairy tale story.  <br>  <br>  if your husband has a brain in his head he will go from cheating on you to dumping you.  making public scenes that cause people lose their jobs?  that is the damage that YOU do.  all you have done is ruin 3 peoples reputations, you included there.  <br>  <br>  it is very clear why he cheated on you.  if you really think something good is going to come of the way you conducted yourself, you are delusional. <br>  <br>   it is always amusing to read about people who act like idiots.  you can tell your funny story when you go to your night waitressing job at dennys.
pVnUhYLQaa	Try seeing if maybe the two of you can experiment with some new things together. BDSM maybe? Ask him if he wants to go to the sex toy shop with you, maybe pick out some toys together. Stuff like that can light a spark. You're in a rut, you need to try something new. Talk to him about, let him know your concerns, it all starts with communication.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Buy this book, the first story might interest you. <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Darker-Side-Pleasure-Eden-Bradley/dp/0553589741/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235752446&sr=1-3" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Darker-Side-Pleasu...</a><br>  <br>  You can read the first couple pages here:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0553589741/ref=sib_dp_ptu#reader-link" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/05535897...</a> <br>  <br>  EDIT: Kelly, did you read the question?<br>  "We used to have great sex sessions at least 30 min. Now I'm lucky if its 2."<br>  "I'm lucky if its 2" kinda tells me that SHE WANTS it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And who ever gave a thumbs down to me basically saying, communicate and try to introduce new things, I would love to know what you disagree with.<br>  <br>  EDIT: He may be depressed; ask him. You need to be able to have these conversations with him.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	The only way for him to build up his tolerance is to start having sex more frequently again.  If he isn't in the mood then that might be a problem getting him to do 4 days a week again.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	when you find out. let me know. i think my man got lazy. that's just me though, so maybe that's not the case.  also, sex is so predictable at this point. i just bought a karma sutra coupon book w/ sex positions. so, we talked about playing scrabble (that's what we do) and the winner gets to pick out a postion. eventually, hopefully, the whole book will be empty, meaning we tried every positon. so far, we havent even opened it.....we're quite boring.|`|ULUpOqplaa	When men get into a long term relationship part of their brain shuts down.  MRI's show this.  Part of that has to do with sex.  Not sex in general, but sex with you.  If you walked naked women in front of him he could go for hours.  To him you are becoming invisible.  Not surprising that your question has been asked by almost every married female since the first 2 cells differentiated.|`|evJ2GEodaa	maybe because you are PREGNANT!|`|kN4EaiUDaa	my husband and i are like that right now but also i'm in my first triamester pregnant. i cant believe your even asking why he's a quick shooter. its because he's not getting sex as often so it's really horny and has alot of *** to shoot out. give him a break. maybe if you gave him more sex he would last longer. i always recommend to try the 30days of sex. make it a goal to have sex everyday and try several different positions. have sex everyday for a month could get boring but thats the fun of having to try new things. trust me after a month of straight sex it will bring your sex drive up and will bring you and your husband closer than you could ever imagine. the thing is, is that you have to make it a goal and sometimes might have to force yourself to have sex, but if your like me once you get in bed and you start going at it, i start enjoying it and i'm really glad i did it after we're done.|`|i5gDZeumaa	call me and we will start by having sex-just to see if the problem might be with your sex drive

I am saying this with the most gentle terms of 'lecturing' put aside. 13 is so young, so vibrant, so new and able to take on a variety of passions from a variety of things instead of just being with the 'love of your life'. You have to grow into the beautiful person you are before being to give another person a part of you, or someday all of you when ready. At so young and not having experienced much of anything yet at all, your clearly physically, emotionally, psychologically not ready to know that you have found 'the love of your life'.  <br>  <br>  Tell your friend, and speak from your heart they will listen, give time for you to become everything YOU can because in the end it will be only you who sees the inevitable alone. It is possible you feel very much aloive, in sync, in tune, really good when your with this person, but to resign yourself to just one before ever experiencing others is really not giving yourself to have the time of your life and be with many 'loves of your life'. <br>  <br>  There is not just one you know . . . at 42 I have graciously accepted i had a few 'loves of my life' already and I am just beginning to be the best I have ever been ! <br>  <br>  sharing the light,<br>  Miss Erica Hidvegi|`|0GqYeMVWaa	NO.im not shouting but NO.believe me ,my first crush was a 13yr old hairy greek boy who was an idiot(not because he was greek or hairy) he was just an idiot.....our brains develop at different stages and believe me again,your brain hasnt developed enough yet.im not being mean.just trust me on this.|`|6PVFDHnzaa	yea anythings possible. =) but statistics show that like 80% break up after 1 year and then it's like only 1% marry they're high school love.

W3bELVbmaa	do you really think this girl will think more of you if you "beat the crap" out of your brother? no, of course not. she'll think your a bully who - well - beats the crap outta his family members. dont be an idiot like that, so perhaps go up to her instead and actually try using your mouth and talking to her. its actually pretty easy and the reason she might have given you a "mean" look is because she knows all these rumours are being spread, but she may think you started them you know. go put her straight, tell her you didnt start them and that you hate them as much as she does. of course she doesnt like it, no one likes to have things said about them which arent true, so why dont you make it true and ask her out or something?<br>  if she says no, leave her alone - as for her being angry that your brother told anyone who would listen that you like her; maybe shes mad at that because you didnt tell her, she had to hear it from a rumour-spreader.<br>  <br>  my best friend, who is a guy, had a similar situation to this, and he never acted on it. she ended up going out with his cousin who was in the school and the rest of the school year was horrific...<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  x|`|8kh2jshLaa	i say go kick your brother's *ss.<br>  you shouldn't care what anyone says and i guess you should give an a apology to her for the mess . im not saying this is your fault at all but im meaning as a gentlemen , people are bothering her about it and she obliviously doesn't like it .|`|qD3QirUJaa	Be tough and manly... say to her 'Sorry about this.

X3YazRSoaa	Well the best thing you should do is talk to your dad, and if that does not work, go back with your mom.

Find out where the paperwork is and go after one!<br>  If nothing else, you make your own gig by babysitting in the meantime just to bring in some money while taking you out of the house.

Learn to operate it without looking at it, while it is in your pocket. When you have a nice collection, you take your dad to one side and play it all for him.<br>  <br>  See if you can go live with your mom.|`|OSzHAr8uaa	Go live with your mom.

If your father and step mother are that horrible of people than move back with your mother, see if your boyfriend will let you stay with him, if he lives with parents see if they will understand your situation enough to help you out for a little while. It's a hard situation to be in and I hope you the best possible outcome.|`|6WjUi3M5aa	Move. It is that simple. Your dad has made a choice to be with this woman, and currently, he is not going to hold you higher than she.

DLfPx1Hqaa	hmm.. well, who did the dumping the first time? sometimes you realise you've made a mistake. Does he know about the other guy? I probably wouldn't tell him that to begin with... it's not like you did anything wrong anyway. but if he dumped you the first time, try to figure out if he's just leading you on...<br>  I think the movie thing is a good idea.. but don't let him stuff you around either.. if you hook up, but then he doesn't seem to want a relationship, don't be a doormat.<br>  I hope it works out for you! good luck! oh, and don't worry about what the twit wrote above my answer- she left me a stupid answer too.. seems she doesn't like being told what we really think when she asks a question, lol!|`|9Q07kREJaa	talk to him
UawvrRpgaa	yes play hard to get. you did all you could do. you told  him how you felt. the balls in his court now. flirt around and try to get him to see u with other guys. hopefully he will do the right thing|`|0dd0cKUGaa	It will depend on the guy but this is what I would do. Speak to him, in person is best, and let him know how you feel about him. Then, leave it up to him. Don't stop communicating but don't always initiate it. If he wants you back let him decide and pursue you. If he doesn't then he won't. Its as simple as that.|`|8kh2jshLaa	why do you do things so complicated <br>  he likes you , you like him and ta da  !<br>  there's nothing to it ,<br>  play hard to get and he'll think your not into him no more .<br>  good luck|`|A1cCdluFaa	No, it may make im like u less!!! - he may get annoyed with u and go off u!!! although this isnt certain, it may work.  hope this helps|`|eMSP740Taa	See! So playing hard to get has already worked in your favor, he's already contacting you first. This is a good sign because if you played hard to get and he never reached out to you, that would show his true feelings. But the fact that he in fact  IS contacting you, means he's missing you already! DEFINITELY keep playing hard to get. Guys do not like a girl to chase them, they like to be the hunter. Otherwise, you'll eventually turn him off to you. GOOD LUCK!! :)|`|hX5NOoiPaa	um listen first of all what is your sign like libra and cancer are perfect matches why because air libra and water cancer have little to no conflict. also earth taurus and water scorpio get along so i want you to come to grips that you two may not be compabatabile at all|`|b8bf1118bff8f4590ca0b13f136c6115aa	be a girl of the new century and conquer him instead of let him do it|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	tell him how you feel...don't play hard to get...put it all on the table.  <br>  <br>  Leave it up to him...if he wants you, he'll reciprocate...if not, he'll move on.<br>  <br>  If he neither reciprocates nor moves on, then you need to move on.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	yes play a little hard to get

However, there is no language wherein a double positive can form a negative.' <br>  <br>  A loud voice from the back of the room piped up, 'Yeah, right.' <br>  <br>  2) Robert went to his lawyer and said, 'I would like to make a will but I don't know exactly how to go about it.'   The lawyer smiled at Robert and replied, 'Not a problem, leave it all to me.' <br>  <br>  Robert looked somewhat upset and said, 'Well, I knew you were going to take a big portion, but I would like to leave a little to my family too!' <br>  <br>  3) A policeman spotted a jay walker and decided to challenge him, 'Why are you trying to cross here when there's a zebra crossing only 20 metres away?'   <br>  <br>  'Well,' replied the jay walker, 'I hope it's having better luck than me.' <br>  <br>  4) Two lawyers arrive at the pub and ordered a couple of drinks.

rqFbNhAGaa	if 2 people share a cousin but on different sides of the family the people who share the cousin are unrelated.<br>  <br>  eg, my aunty has a son called Travis, someone I went to school with Drew, is also Travis's cousin through Travis's father so that makes me and Drew Travis's cousins but Drew and I are unrelated.<br>  <br>  If the cousins are on the same side of the family from an aunty or uncle you and your friend are both related to then you would be cousins.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	could be nothing if you are related to them on opposite sides of their family.<br>  <br>  and how does one have half cousins?  There is no such thing.  They are either your cousins or they are not.<br>  <br>  your mom's or dad's sibling + member of the opposite sex = offspring who is your first cousin<br>  <br>  your mom's or dad's first cousin + member of the opposite sex= offspring who is your second cousin<br>  <br>  There are no halvesies where cousins are concerned.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  I have a half sister.  We share a father but have different mothers.  As her mother and my father are no longer married to each other, her family on her mother's side are no longer related to me by marriage and were never related to me by blood.  So her cousins from her mother's side of the family are not my relatives just as my cousins from my mother's side of the family are not related to her.<br>  <br>  BUT the cousins that we share on my father's side of the family are her full cousins because our entire connection to them is only through our father.<br>  <br>  EDIT D'OH!:<br>   I got ya!  I forgot about the next generation!  My half sister's children and my children are genetically half cousins.  I don't think of them that way so I always forget that connection.  I only think of them as my neices and nephew and our children as first cousins.<br>  <br>  BUT it's still the same.  If you are related to your cousin from one side of the family and your friend is related on your cousin's other side of the family then there is no relation between you and your friend.<br>  <br>  My children and the children of my half sisters other siblings to whom I am not related are no relation to my children.<br>  <br>  BUT if you and your friend are from the same side of the family to your half cousin then it's possible that you are also cousins of some sort.  But you'd have to have some other family connection besides your half cousin in common.|`|AA11318212	Distant relatives I guess.|`|gYv1XUwzaa	Doesn't make you related at all.
ed8e4f9bdf039903975d76be5f2cfd3faa	short answer: Yes he does :)<br>  <br>  Long answer: he does but due to his shyness he is unable to express it through an array of words & actions as it appears he is not a very socialising person (i.e. he's shy). But he likes you :), be nice back but don't put him under pressure. Little gestures like ask him if he wants to walk to the bus with you, go somewhere, sit next to each other at lunch or go and have lunch together. Have some time with just you and him :) then decide for yourself whether we're all lying or that we're telling the truth. You'll have to experience what a shy person goes through when they like someone to understand him. All in all he likes you :).<br>  <br>  Lol my big words ^^|`|Sma3ekSOaa	I think that he likes you|`|TutWAUJjaa	i am 99.9% sure he likes you|`|M9LB94FHaa	yes he probably does...try talking to him a little more, maybe get his screen name if you have AIM or something..=]|`|drBgy7bAaa	I think he like you.<br>  You should try to hint to him that you like him.|`|mzIN4scxaa	I think he like u..<br>  Good Luck...|`|TawYWc4waa	sounds like he takes u seriously and theres a good chance he likes u|`|VU0TtvxPaa	Yall should just play together and that's how tall are going to get to know each other just start talking about stuff its more comfortable like that
8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa	Girl, I didn't even finish reading your question because it is clear that this is no man for you.  <br>  <br>  Husbands and wives are to be helpmates to and for each other.  You cannot have a relationship with a man who will not share in your troubles or take part in your life, but demands that you accept his.   <br>  <br>  A man who is worthy of being a husband shares in your troubles, shares in your dreams, shares in your life, and wants to be with you, regardless of your troubles.  <br>  <br>  You re not in love with him, you are in-fatuation with him.  Leave him and find someone who is interested in you, and all your foibles and faults.  <br>  <br>  Love is patient, love is kind, love is not jealous, love does not seek to do harm.  Love helps you to overcome your issues, without raking you over the coals for them.  Love does not make you want to hide.  Love makes you want to be a better you.  Love makes you more responsible, and not less.  Love makes you think more about the other person's needs over your own.  <br>  <br>  If you cannot say this about YOURSELF in relation with someone else, then leave.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	it's not love, maybe it was on your part, but it's more like crazy.<br>  <br>  Then again, being in love is like being insane.|`|YtSGbYqEaa	girl thats not a very good relationship at all you should dump him and find you a real man a nice respectful man|`|6tcXKcBgaa	This is obvious. <br>  This relation will go no where. <br>  & he is a dumb fu ck. Leave him. <br>  Find someone better, someone who will treat you like a queen.|`|SNUP0BJ3aa	This is not love.<br>  <br>  This is him being manipulative and mentally abusive and you catering to his every want and need. I've been there before. And you deserve so much better than this.<br>  <br>  As much as you  may feel attached to him, he is incredibly disrespectful and selfish. You created a list of everything you've done to change for him. What has he done for you? He already knows you're willing to bend over backwards for him. He knows he can insult you, put you down, treat you as though you aren't good enough-- and you'll still be there. If he truly cared about YOU at all, he would not be treating you this way. He would listen to you, want you to be happy, care for you and treat you as though you were everything to him. He'd do everything in his power so that he didn't lose you. The reason he's being nice now is because he probably recognizes you've had enough. DON'T fall for anything he says. He knows what it will take to bring you right back to him and twisted around his little finger. And he'll go right back to his old ways.<br>  <br>  Please please know that you deserve so much to be loved. You deserve to be happy. You are a strong person and do not need him. Love is so much more than this, sweetie. And your life will be much better once you walk away from him and NEVER go back.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Utp2nM8waa	You say, 'if this is love, I am disgusted'.  This is not love, hang it up and wait (don't look) for someone who is interested in meeting your needs and building you up and encouraging you to be the best you can be.  Wait for someone who is able to set goals, has a vision for the future  Look for someone who can be a friend, someone you can be a friend to.  Someone who is worthy of trust as can be proved by a past.  Real love and lasting passion can be REAL in a relationship based on trust, friendship and selflessness.|`|vyU59X7zaa	That sounds like a pretty crappy and unstable "relationship".<br>  <br>  He has way too many needs.<br>  I would definitely say break free of that person. He is probably just using you.
seMpUL8Kaa	Push yourself. I'm quite a shy person myself, but little things I have done have meant I'm gaining more confidence. <br>  Things like, just asking a question to someone you don't know, sitting next to people in class you don't normally. As for the singing. Try kareoke. Get a friend to get up with you at first, and as you gain confidence, try one on your own, it's a fun way of getting used to singing in front of others.|`|gGRccjlVaa	go crazy!(not mentally) but try to talk to alot of people!!!|`|HOrQXK6paa	If your shy your shy and don't make friends trying to be something that your simply not...I know that its not worth it just keep being you!

AA10226585	SLIM in 2008 is absolutely right.  All of you are joining the Navy.  It will make a huge difference in all your lives.  <br>  <br>  My own experience is becoming somewhat dated (I've been out for over a decade) but infidelity was rampant in the units I was in (as for me, I was single at the time).  It's going to test your relationship, both of you.  <br>  <br>  It's not an easy life, even if you're used to him being away for 2 weeks at a time.  He could conceivably be gone for 6 to 9 months or more; the needs of the service, and of the country, come first.  Just because you're sick or the kids are having problems in school or that they (and you) miss him doesn't mean he can quit and come home.  And even if he serves just 4 years, his total commitment is going to be 8 years, with the balance in the 'inactive ready reserve', which means that even 3 or 4 years after getting out, he can still be called back to active duty (it's rare, but it does happen).<br>  <br>  Having said that, the money really is pretty good, especially for those who are married, and the benefits are totally and completely beyond anything you'll find in the civilian world.  It's also one of the most respected professions around.  The opportunities to travel are amazing, if you're willing to take advantage of them.  Job security is also something to consider.  As long as he stays in shape and doesn't do anything too stupid, and puts forth at least a little effort every now and then, and gets promoted up through the ranks, he can stay in for at least 20 years and get a military retirement.|`|b34a54682dc09f70279f26554322d78aaa	Expect him to be gone a lot and sometime for a long period of time.  Military life is SO different than civilian's life, especially if you live on base. There're a lot of rules that him and you both have to follow and obey.  The pay is all right and it is stable but it comes with ups and downs too - and make sure that you are ready for it.  He may be moving from one base to another quite often and the kids may either hate it or love it - so be ready for that as well. It doesn't have to be bad though, you will get pretty good health care and it is pretty stable. Good luck!|`|YoSgEUstaa	like slim said, your whole family is joining. it's a very interesting and great experience. if you have more specific questions feel free to e-mail me. husband is in the navy. i think you will find that it's a very rewarding experience.|`|MDgVPwU3aa	Alot of men cheat on their wives too while on duty Truth Seeker 2020, it goes both ways.

He'll go to basic training followed by a tech school. the length of time he'll be gone is based on the type of job he's going into. Different jobs have different training lengths. You'll have the option to see him when he graduates from basic training. I think you'll get to spend the weekend with him. Not really sure how the navy does it. then he'll go to tech school/AIT. Did he go active or guard? If he went active he'll be assigned a base at the end of tech. I believe he'll get a 2 week leave between the completion of tech and his report date to his base. You'll also have to option to attend his tech graduation. If he went guard he'll come home after tech and then start drill on his assigned weekends. His recruiter should be able to answer any questions you have.|`|e1oky4jSaa	I love it that my husband is in the military serving his country.

7OQsx028aa	I think it's because he's a tool that is trying to compensate for his insecurities by creating a 'look at me' way of signing his messages.<br>  <br>  I bet this guy probably takes pictures of famous places / natural wonders that make it look like the obelisk in question (Washington Monument, Leaning Tower of Pisa) are actually his 'boy parts'.|`|vDrbMr9gaa	it's just a style some people use so their names aren't typed like everyone else's.|`|ee1o46cTaa	lol i like it. he's stating his pH levels hope he's balanced|`|zM0KqdtNaa	It's just another one of those computer ... trends i guess you could say. like using LOL or OMG. it's really common these days. my friends do it all the time like on myspace. nothing really that strange about it.|`|dSpABqSPaa	Many people like to do that to add style to their names or screen names that would otherwise look plain stupid when hand written.

CfCJyV2Paa	Well think about: do you ever get flirty, even if you don't necessarily like a guy? That might be what he's doing. Also, I'm sure you've had that feeling where you think to yourself "you know, he's not that bad. i don't particularly like him, but i think i would consider dating him if he ever asked." Perhaps he just thinks you're cute. My guess is he's just a flirt. But hey! give it time. It seems to me like he might actually like you. Possibly the fact that youre a soph and hes a senior stands in the way (you know how seniors can be.)

EOh0lEO3aa	Rosessis that is completely unhelpful and irrelevant.<br>  <br>  Hannah, I'm sorry to hear that your brother is making you so unhappy. I was lucky in my family because I was the oldest, but I was picked on by other people at my school and I know it can make life almost unbearable. <br>  <br>  The other answers so far are pretty much right. I'm not sure you'd be wise to go to the police, as your parents will be pretty upset about it. However you definitely do need to speak to someone. I would start with your parents. I know they haven't done anything as yet, but you need to speak to them at a convenient time, when your brother is not around. You must stay calm and explain to them exactly how unhappy your brother is making you. It might help to have one of your friends or cousins who he has also been doing it to with you to back you up. Then they will be more likely to believe you. If they don't do anything, the next step is to talk to one of your teachers. They will be able to offer you loads of really good advice as they have to deal with horrible children all the time! And they will be able to point you in the direction of more help, as well as talking to your parents for you if necessary.<br>  <br>  I hope this all gets better soon honey, but don't worry coz one day he'll leave home!!! <br>  <br>  xxxx|`|inAr70nJaa	my older brothers are the same 2 and when we get int fights they get believed because their older<br>  the next time he hits u just burst into tears i did that once and its stops them in their tracks lol<br>  i suggest u sit down with your parents and discuss like an adult about your brother tell them how upset its making you <br>  older brothers are awful i no i have 2  <br>  about the name calling just ignore him <br>  when u are older u will be laughing about this but for now get it sorted <br>  <br>  tell your parents x hope i helped xxx|`|EvIWKqpDaa	Talk to a counselor at your school or a trusted teacher.|`|0KyBl4rUaa	show him ur cock...show him what u got...|`|HZgjUguWaa	Hannah darling you must be 13y.o. to be on yahoo answers dear+|`|5J3mM09Daa	Tell a neighbor or teacher what he does to you.

zdu3gh8jaa	You stop using words and start using actions to show your mum how sorry you are. Words are nothing if they are not sincere, obviously yours haven't been in the past, hence the situation that you are in now. Start proving to your mum that you don't hate her and are really and truly sorry, and instead of shouting off to her, start to listen and respect what she is saying to you - that way you may just learn something that will help you grow into a respectable and thoughtful adult. Good luck.|`|la9zji2Uaa	An apology goes a long way - just be sincere when you say it. And learn to control your temper - pesky kids. lol. x|`|9bdEPcWIaa	The word "HATE" is one of the most strong word you could throw at someone and could have a serious effect.  I suggest you completely throw out the word and never use it ever again no matter what you're referring to, write a promissory note to your mom stating so.  Also the word "stupid" should never be used, people who use the word "stupid" always sound like one.<br>  <br>  Remember, words are like bullets, once fired, it cannot be recalled.|`|NZVP15Soaa	you need some anger management so you will not<br>  be taking your stress out on your mother<br>  say sorry and talk to your mum about how you are feeling<br>  and if you are getting stressed you have to get help<br>  your mum will help if only you will talk to her<br>  <br>  take care|`|KFJw8EP2aa	You could always write down how you feel and why you've said the things you did, then just hand it to her and say that you'd like her to read it.|`|zHNPTV67aa	i have the same problem with my mum u know what just say sorry even doe u say it all the time and at least your heart and consensece be at rest|`|nmAm0P1Xaa	The important thing is, that you mean what you say. You can tell her hundred times you're sorry, but that doesn't mean anything if you don't work on it together. And I know, I had a lot of fights with my mum, but who doesn't?<br>  Just go up to her and say, Mum, it's my fault this time and I shouldn't have said it. But shall we work on it together to let this never happen again?<br>  Or something like that. And other people are right, a apology goes a long way, and if you work down the road, you'll notice it get's better and better;)! Good luck!|`|NaGN3mE3aa	Ive had the same problem. an apology cutres her heart one or two times but you told her you hated her. you went to far and its up to your actions to change things. Go right now and talk to her. tell her > "Mom im sorry and i know youre tired of my apologies but i need you in my life, you mean the world to me and im tired of us fighting. I now this apology wnt make things better but i want you to know ill change so from this day on observe my behavior and lets be friends" help her out with the dishes, or something but prove to her youre truly sorry. ive been thru the same shyt but imma prove to my mom i can change,. its not about words but its about actions she only punishes you cuz she cares. and they have a 6th sense so they know when things are wrong. listen to her. shes a wise woman and she doesnt deserve to be treated like that..|`|9EV86TLvaa	I know what you mean. Me and my mum fight all the time it happens. What i did was I told her I was sorry as well as showing her if that makes sense.  I made her a card and brought her a box of chocolate because all women like chocolate. Big clue there. trust me it will work. Good luck|`|yf1A2FHfaa	Buy bunch of flowers and write on card 'loves you'

If they did, they were just as much an abberation as dating 12 year olds now.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	and this relates to marriage how?<br>  <br>  My children were allowed to start dating at the same age I was.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I did not date at 12.

We do not get married at 18 like they do. We do not work real jobs like they did at 14. Our society overall is changing to protect the young.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Because us adults didn't date when we were 12. Some may have had a "boyfriend" or "girlfriend", but not really. Just someone that they saw at school and held hands sometimes.|`|dFUqPcWKaa	Because kids are stupid and parents are not. Maybe if kids could learn how to use condoms, parents would be a little more willing to let them out of the dungeon every once in a while.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Because we remember the stupid stuff we did and want to protect you from making the same mistakes we did.

1YdeUn1Caa	You open the door, and throw her *** out. Works for me.|`|65m62rDraa	It is your parent's house. They can get her out. You would need proof that she is an unfit mother, and the courts can rule her out of her daughter's life or limit her visitation rights. Either way, your parents owe her nothing, and they don't have to put up with her any more than they want to.

Maybe she was in a similar situation and doesn't want the same life for her kid. All i can say is you can forgive but not forget!|`|MNBGRi0Gaa	it could be more than that he is the father of her son. Being a man in a similar situation it's more about love and the real personality behind the person that did wrong. And not to mention their is a great deal of love i have for the kid being that i found out the real truth 2 years later. You can tell her the guy has did everything wrong imaginable but if it's in her heart and soul to be with him there is nothing you can do. <br>  <br>  <br>  "Never say you will never do and/or be like something without going through the motions because you never know when you will contradict yourself".|`|17v9Y30Uaa	Usually it is because they still have feelings for the other, no matter what they did. <br>  <br>  Or sometimes they think that the man will change, and usually they never do. They can say they will all they want, most of the time it will never happen. <br>  <br>  Or she thinks she is doing the right thing, being "faithful" or something. <br>  <br>  Or she is doing it for her son. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|AA11265589	self esteem issues.  unable to see her self worth.  comfort ability. like old shoes.|`|DLTT0Svjaa	crazy|`|91MrKpIiaa	desperate
lJUyhMceaa	It is not healthy to stay at home all the time and be on the computer all the time.  You need some variety in your life, and you need some exercise, fresh air, and human contact.  Compromise a little and listen to your dad.  Find something to do once or twice a week that does not involve the computer.  <br>  <br>  Personally I would be happy to have my kids at home all the time.  But, not necessarily on the computer.  Maybe spending some time away from the computer.  Watch tv with your family or something might be a compromise.  Good luck.|`|u7LSohRyaa	Looks like it's time to get some exercise walking in the park, riding your bike, shooting hoop or spending time at the library. They have computers there too usually. Maybe you'll meet new friends online.|`|AA11789493	Well, I am just the same as you in that I'm happy staying home except I'm old, a widow, and I've raised my family and I'm retired and have never been a "joiner" because I was to busy meeting my responsibilities and taking care of my family.  I think your Dad is more concerned than angry--he wants you to have friends, date, have a wide range of interests and hopes you are okay.  I can tell you one thing, nobody is going to come to the house looking for you to go out.  You have to make yourself available by being friendly, joining clubs at school or get involved in some kinds of sport or extra curricular activity.  You might also want to look for a small, part time job that has young people--stocking shelves or as a cashier at say Target.  Or you could volunteer somewhere where other kids are doing their community service hours.  It's hard to change what it is comfortable, but try to find another positive outlet.  Maybe ask Dad to pay for karate lessons!!!!!!!!|`|GTKXq7A1aa	I like this too, he thinks that u rnt doing anything with your life.|`|0HYfFZKVaa	Since you love computers and games try finding a computer cafe or gaming center near. That way you can play your games and meet new people. He may just be worried about your future social skills. Get out and have some fun you only live once. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|QAEm0Yitaa	If i was you, i would leave, find another family member or something.|`|mmrcaoUzaa	You should get a job, if you are of age, that way you will seem productive to your father and he will see that you are taking initiative in your life and planning ahead in order to buy yourself either a car or maybe a new game system. Also, I've made many of my friends through my job and they're very relaxed and interesting people, that way you will have a job taking up time you would be wasting around your house and then of course you would have your co-workers to hang out with while not at work. It's a very effective method and if your down on cash while employed your father will be more than likely to give you money for food or new clothes if you wish.|`|DkHxvCzIaa	go find a place you like to hang out if you like doing homework or playin on the computer go to like a library or somewhere|`|KSwqDDUuaa	Get out of the house, there's others who live there too.|`|AA10336148	You need to flat hunt and move out!|`|UxL9QufRaa	Get out of the house man.<br>  <br>  P.S.

You either want to separate or yu don't. Perhaps asking for a legal separation first and explaining that your thinking about divorce would be better.|`|WUwIk3Fgaa	maybe, it's not your marriage that's unhappy, maybe you are an unhappy person that is just plain miserable and would still be whether you were married to a different person or not married at all. think about it.<br>   <br>  and if this is totally not the case, then you need to explore other options other than divorce before you throw in the towel. <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.|`|dlGZebDmaa	Write him a letter with exactly everything that's going through your mind and how you feel. Make sure you'll be away for a couple of days so he can take his time to absorb the information and come up with an answer.<br>  <br>  Guess after that, you guys should be able to talk and try to work things out or get a divorce. Divorce is a painful thing and there isn't much you can do.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|FasxVeohaa	If you have such a happy relationship than there should be no reason to bring up divorce, Of course unless your are a cheater!!! In that case you need to come clean and let the other person know why you did it in the first place|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	if you are in a "happy relationship" why r u contemplating leaving it?|`|xWtW2kHraa	The same way you would in a miserable marriage- bring it up and the sooner the better.|`|6u9cHAYJaa	You start by telling your spouse the entire TRUTH!
HZvdr8VLaa	If he's not telling you about it up front and he's keeping it a secret, that's what you need to be concerned about. I have contact with plenty of old women friends but my wife knows about it because I told her. I had one of my female ex-coworkers over for lunch the other day. I called up the wife and said "Hey you mind if she comes over?" and she thought that was great. As soon as it becomes a hidden secret between partners, then you have a problem.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	It's definitely not all right.  He might not be cheating, or even trying to cheat, but it's way inappropriate.  It's probably an ego thing.  Even though he's married, he likes to know he can still be be in touch with former girlfriends.  Guys have a tough time facing the fact that the race is over.  These girls probably don't want anything to do with him.<br>  To give him some perspective, tell him you're keeping in touch with all your former male friends/lovers and see how he reacts to that.|`|m8QfHC7uaa	The best way to understand if a spouse is cheating, is if they "change" is some of the things that were always the same. My suggestion to you is that you ask him to spend some more time with you. Perhaps even schedule some activities, such as walks, movie, dinner with him and just you, no interruptions. And no, unless children are involved I do not think it is reasonable or acceptable for anyone to hang out with ex-anythings! What's done is done.  I'm truly scared you will be hurt if he continues.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Yes it's cheating and very inappropriate.  He is not respecting you.|`|INZ1LlHGaa	It is one thing to keep in touch and be polite with an old flame, but it is a whole different story to hang out with that old flame without your partner there. <br>  <br>  Is your husband willing to have you with him when he meets with his ex? Is he hiding his communication with her from you? That is signs that he knows his behavior is inappropriate. <br>  <br>  But there are some guys out there who are honestly just able to be firends with girls after a breakup and see nothing wrong with it. <br>  <br>  If he is spending time with her, hiding it from you, that says to me he is relying on her for something. It may not be sexual, but it may be emotional or intimate. <br>  <br>  Brad and Angelina swear they didn't hook up while he was still married, but Brad had an emotional affair and checked out of his marriage to Jennifer Aniston because of his relationship with Angelina. <br>  <br>  It is a similar thing. There doesn't need to be sex if a man is connecting on a deep personal level.<br>  <br>  You need to talk to your husband honestly and explain your concerns in a non-hostile and neutral territory.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	I was posting about this yesterday and i got mad. But i realized that my husband is very open with me so it is no excuse for me to get all insecure and respond in such a manner.<br>  <br>  I actually realized by this how pathetic and nearly was about to give up because of this. You need to ask yourself what makes you feel this way and need to question is he upfront and open with you. Unfortunately i got a bit carried away and missing the whole concept of our marriage as we have been bashing our heads recently.<br>  <br>  But just remember he married you...he choose to spend the rest of his life with you. So be confident and do not let insecurity eat the positive attributes he loved about you.|`|xWtW2kHraa	The successful marriages I am familiar with have firm boundaries for these situations. These boundaries are maintained by mutual respect.<br>  <br>  Communicate with him and come up with boundaries that you both agree upon.|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe you should see about getting your jealousy, insecurity and paranoia sorted first...<br>  <br>  you obviously don't trust the man... and don't respect him...<br>  <br>  you don't feel that a man and a woman can be friends without you thinking they are having sex??? how old-fashioned...<br>  <br>  does that mean you want to have sex with all YOUR male friends???|`|19b02a50f67872d6956b72cff56771e0aa	Cheating ..to be honest for men? YES because they are hunters and their brain doesn't work the same as it does for a woman   woman CAN be just friends with a men or ex.. for a men I can not see that happen  unless he is gay ..|`|982b63b7af7d35aa88514fbe563f2b78aa	Do you trust him  as a person that is the question ? <br>  <br>  He can also do it behind your back so you need to find out why you don't trust him.|`|ZEitfScGaa	I think the only way you should stay in contact with an ex, especially if you are in another relationship, is if you have kids together.|`|2hWQvq65aa	I am a guy and I find it inappropriate|`|r7u2g8roaa	A straight, unsophisticated but truthful answer:<br>  <br>  It is if the man is an inbreed, hill-dwelling cretin who's uncle and father are the same........or if he is cheating/ planning to cheat on his present woman.|`|zifEvqy2aa	no its not appropriate|`|94b8KImYaa	In your question you are mixing two things. The one is old female friends and the other one is ex-lovers. <br>  <br>  Now old female friends - I see nothing wrong with this. You husband is still an individual and if he has female friends - you cannot deny him that. (and you should not) <br>  <br>  With ex lovers it is a tricky story. Some people are - besides being lovers - best friends. And to let go off that is difficult, Especially, when there is now only friendship. And yes it is not great to know that ones now husband still chats with an ex lover. <br>  <br>  So for the ex-lovers I say - in appropriate<br>  for old female friends I say - no this is ok|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	He may not be actually cheating but he is playing with fire and trying to relive his single days.  It's not safe and certainly isn't something a happily married man should be doing.
L8J5nNjDaa	when you go home without him/her, and have a hard time sleeping is when you should move in together... and of course, you see forever oh so clearly with him/her. marriage is for when you two are financially stable.|`|kxUigIkraa	Statistics show that those who move in together first and then marry are much more likely to divorce than otherwise. It has to do with the fact that when you move in together, you think that you know a person. Then after you marry, suddenly you project roles onto each other without intending too. <br>  <br>  I don't think that there is any real limit of time. Its all a matter of, is he/she the one or not? Marriage is always a calculated risk. Just be sure to do some counseling before going into it so that all of the big issues have been discussed.|`|5oj5YfKMaa	I know it is tempting to move in together, especially these days, when there are all these people saying "You never really know someone till you live with them" but I feel different. I have watched, in pain, for years how my sister, who is 40 now, has been cheated out of marriage cause she ALWAYS moves in with these guys. She has not lived with a lot of different guys, and I don't want to give that impression, but she has always wanted to be married to a good man as long as I can remember. I tell her every time, and so far I've been right, that these men are not going to commit themselves to marriage if you give them EVERYTHING up front. When a person does that, guys and girls both, it makes things too convenient and readily available and takes all the mystery out of the relationship without the security of marriage where one cannot just pack up and leave. My wife tried to live with me before we got married and we both had kids from previous marriages and I said "Absolutely Not!" Not only do I live the words I speak, but I have/had a responsibility to my kids to teach them that just cause everybody else is doing it doesn't make it right.<br>  <br>  P.S. The mother of my three boys has had a live in bf for over 5 years...He will never marry her and it's teaching them what this world thinks is okay!|`|eN5xA6RKaa	My fiance and i moved in together pretty soon after dating, it was like a month i think. I would either sleep at his place every night or he would sleep at mie, so we figured we would just stay in 1 place and move in together. We talked about marriage early in our relationship but never made it really official. We just made it official last month *1yr after we started dating* .. Were getting married in October.<br>  The time frame is different for everyone though. There is no set time to move in and get married, its just when it feels right.|`|FasxVeohaa	I think you need to know someone enough to say you want to move in with them. Even friends who are roommates see alot of things that they didn't know about each other after living with them. But moving in with someone for sure does see if you are compatible enough to see if you should move forward in your relationship to marriage. You may not be able to live with some of his kirks and same for him. That is also to see if you guys can work through problems as a couple or if you guys always run to someone else like (mommy,daddy,friends) You hopefully will be able to work things out between yourselves, of course sometimes one of you or both might need a cool down first before talking things out. But that is normal Not everyday can two people get along at all times. Good luck|`|7XG5fd5Xaa	i met my guy in october 07, he was newly separated from his wife, we started dating in Dec 07. we moved in together aug 08, he proposed nov 08, we are getting married oct 09.<br>  I think if you feel its right is when you do it. You will know. It doesnt matter how long youve known the person, whether you get married or not, you do what you feel, think and know is right, whether its forever or not. People will move in with someone before they get married to see how its going to be if they did marry. Its different for every person. You are the judge of when.|`|2hWQvq65aa	12-18 months|`|Y5YBJYdhaa	You get married and then move in..I wish you the best|`|94b8KImYaa	There is no fixed time frame on that. Go with your feeling, what you feel comfortable with and if you want to move in with someone. <br>  Same goes for marriage. <br>  <br>  @ jaded - a wedding ring on your finger does not mean your husband respects you. <br>  You can be better off with the right person and not being married - than having that paper saying - I am married.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	At least a year of dating before you move in together and some overnight visits so you know how he is at home.

It might take you six months, at least, but you need to deal with your feelings, even if it's just for a few minutes a day.  <br>  <br>  Be patient, and don't jump into anything too serious right now.

84fd3d15cdfc89d6cb3f984da767d6dbaa	Do you have an ebay account? If not, that's where you need to begin. I would take several pictures of the dress either hanging up or you wearing it and just cutting off your head on the picture. Take pictures from the front, the back, close up on the design (if there is one), etc. Also explain on there that it has never been worn (make that bold so people can see it) and also put why you did not wear it and why you are not selling it. I know with me personally, I like to know why they are selling it on and why they are not going to wear it if it's something like that. Also, put the amount and place you bought it at.<br>  Oh, and did you do any alterations on it yet? You need to put that (either saying no alterations or there are alterations).|`|HQsmRzPsaa	place a like of what the dress looks like on hrer|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	I would suggest not to sell it on ebay, but to find a wedding dress consignment store in your area, or even a wedding dress store that sells gently used dresses, and put it up for sale there.<br>  I went and looked at used dresses, they have them out according to size to browse through, and I think the process works that they make a commission off your dress once its sold. The best part, they sell the dress for you, you dont have to do anything~<br>  With ebay, your still going to pay a portion of what you sale is back to ebay, and your going to have to ship it, what if the buying doenst want it when they receive it? It sounds like a pain in the rear to me...|`|AA11082914	The first answerer pretty much covered it all, but you probably want to set up a paypal acct. too. I honestly do suggest craigslist, though. Ebay has their fees, plus paypal has theirs, whereas craigslist is totally free. Ebay fees are so much for the ad (depends on asking price), plus you can only post one picture without extra fees, plus you'd have to do it as a bid only if you're not already an experienced seller on there. (My FH ebays stereo stuff on there-- just started a couple of months ago, and you have to have so much seller feedback before you get the buy it now option, which, honestly is a MUCH better way to sell on there.)|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	To start - You need an ebay account.<br>  <br>  After that take good pictures of it and be sure to mention prominently (bold & big letters) that your dress is new and never worn.<br>  Also mention if it was or was not altered yet.|`|6dd9f8d90259c24d923f08e0666b6bcdaa	Most towns have ebay service stores that will sell it for you.

A lot of the mail services also offer ebay services (not the post office) or places like Donkey.net which is a type of ebay service. Then you don't have to worry about having an account. You just provide them with the information. There may be some fees involved, but there are fees involved directly with ebay as well.

EASIER SAID THAN DONE!  Yes honey I have been there.  A 17 year old had a crush on me 2 years ago and I was 24 at the time.  I tried to avoid him because of all the legal things, and giiiirl trust me, age is just a number sometimes.  Cause this 17 year old was way above his years in looks and maturity.  And now I am 26 and he is almost 20 and now I am crushing on him.  I didn't do anything at all back then with him cause I didn't know how people would react.  But anyway, I would say for now to just chill back.  You don't need to stop seeing him but you should stop having sexual contact with him.  Technically if you guys are less than 36 months apart, it's not illegal but I don't how far apart you are.  Good luck girl!|`|24cb37f7fb9c4bf1d5c91252b52e4ab9aa	It is not illegal anywhere to be friends with a 17 year old.<br>  <br>  However, if you have sex with him, his parents could press charges and the consequences would most certainly be dire for you. Wait until he is 18 (legal adult) to call him your boyfriend. I would keep the marriage talk to a minimum as well. <br>  <br>  Are you familiar with prison?

If you decide to exersize or date someone else that is your choice. You have to remember though if it was a long time relationship and you went many places together you have to change those things for now.

If she calls so much why doesn't your husband change is number, you could put a restraining order on her for harassment. Remember though you don't want to upset the adult children it is good that the two of them remain on good terms even with adult children, because face it their will eventually be grandchildren and events that both will share in. Perhaps you shouldn't be so paranoid after all he is married to you now so you shouldn't feel threatened by her unless you feel your own relationship with him isn't secure. If you feel very secure in your relationship you wouldn't really worry about her at all.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Start with a letter from your lawyer about criminal charges will be brought if phone harassment continues, have her arrested when she violates it, then move on to a restraining order. She has to respect boundaries and she can do so of her own free will or with the help of jail time.|`|8f7484cd58d5ae1f35f8ec33cbe9d727aa	Dear Scream,<br>  <br>  Good heavens, hon, you and your husband have put up with enough!!<br>  <br>  Now, be proactive.  First, take NanaMaja's good advice and put a block on your telephone for her cell and home phone.  Secondly, continue following her instructions and get a PPO (Personal Protection Order), but get one for BOTH of you when you do.  Once your husband is protected, she will turn her attention to you because it will bother him.  So, don't waste time with protecting one of you.  Get coverage for both at the same time.<br>  <br>  This woman needs a hobby.  You and your husband have become her hobby.  She needs another hobby.

She does sound like she is a lil "off her rocker". That's my first thought.  You could just change your phone and make his kids promise not to give it to her. <br>  Can you believe how some people just lose it when they lose someone.  I bet she really doesn't want your husband but the fact that he has moved on just drives her crazy.  And I wouldn't suggest the self medicating tactic.  That could just lead to problems down the road.|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	You have to change phone numbers (Cell & land line) its a sorry excuse, just to say, "He has had that number for years and uses it for business which is why he does not want to change it."|`|cyt7oh97aa	And I thought my dad was bad.  He one time walked into my mom's house and checked her caller I.D. to see who her new boyfriend was.<br>  I'd file for a restraining order  and get your numbers changed.

And if she breaks the restraining order then you definitely won't see her!  haha!|`|djUMvICoaa	Have your husband get a restraining order against her and her phone calls. There is no need for her to call him and for you to put up with it.  If your husband can't get the restraining order he is sending you a message on how much he enjoys the attention.  Maybe that is what is getting you.  It doesn't matter, it's a problem no matter how you look at it and you both deserve to live a life without that.  If he does''t get it I would consider my options if I were you.|`|p6QizgmRaa	Talk about not letting go. She's a freak!<br>  There is hope for you and your husband. Just remember, he is trying to get her to stop. Try not to hold the psycho's actions against your husband. He's trying to have a normal life with you. She'll go away sooner or later... once she finds a life. Good luck until then.|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	lol you should get a restraining order one that one.

My recent ex has just left me a week ago. On valentines day we had exactly one year and a half together. We talked of marriage, children, and all that good stuff. She left me last thursday because she felt she needed to get closer to god, and i was holding her back from doing so. I am son confused, but i know one thing is for sure. after asking her a few times since then do you miss me, she says yes... she still says she loves me. Each day with out her feels worse then the day before. i know it hurts, but ask yourself this. Do you really want to move on? i know it seems like you have to, but do you really? i know i see my life with her, and just because of this last situation which has ended a beautiful relationship i know i cant do it with out her. i believe that she is the one i am supposed to love and make my wife, and i intend on doing so. The reason people tend to think they need to move on is because of frustration and hurt. I know i am, i cant go out, even with my ffamily because she has become such a huge part of my life she was so comfortable with my family. Eventually they will realize they love you too. If you havent talked to your boyfriend lately i say you call him up. Start off with small talk and allow him the comfort of your voice. If this was a true relationship then you should know deep inside that he thinks as much of those memories as you do. this is one of the only things that keeps me going and striving to fix this relationship. Give him the understanding, and that you have grown. Fix the problem that broke you up and learn to grow as a couple, not apart. The more you fix problems with one another the strong the relationship grows. Its more beautiful and meaningful once you get them back. As for now our hearts just bleed and hurt, but once they come back and hea lall wounds it makes all the hurt worth it. I hope everything works out, just keep thinking positive and you will get him back if you truly want him back. moving on isnt always the  best idea, because you still love them. Love should not be ignored but embraced and ready to be given. give it, just make him know your willing to bend and help change to make the relationship as good as possible. I hope all works out|`|T02BJJGjaa	When you care deeply about someone it takes time to move on and for the pain of memories to heal.  The only way to put this to you is to pull yourself up by the boot straps, hold you head high and start to participate in life again.   Not easy, I know.   You have to face pain before you can heal the pain.   Go out with your friends even if you are forcing yourself to.   Conceal your inner feelings and just give it a go.  You just might be surprised at how the memories begin to fade, good things start happening and you get your life back without this person.  Good luck, and remember this say "No pain, no gain".  Everything in life is a learning lesson for us.  When you learn from it, you grow.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Girl, I understand your pain.  I feel for you.  Do you see what has happened?  Like most women, you fell in love and lost yourself to this man.  LOST yourself!   Believe it or not, that is a big mistake when getting involvd with a man or falling in love.  When a woman loses herself to a man, he senses that, and it will push him away.  He starts to feel suffocated by the burden of knowing that you have placed everything upon him for your happiness.  All men do it.  I know from massive experience.  The only thing you can do to, is to help yourself by finding yourself again.  Learn to love yourself, by yourself, and for yourself.  Go out as much as possible, meet new people, meet up with good friends, just don't dwell on him or the relationship.  Your grief is normal and you need to go through the stages of grieving.  Don't be so hard on yourself, allow yourself TIME.  I know you want the pain to be over fast so you can move on.  But you need to have closure and the only way to do that is to FIND yourself.  Life has a funny way of healing a woman's heart.  Believe in yourself and one other important thing.....you shouldn't take him leaving you, personally.  That is what you are doing... taking it personally.  It is him, not you.  He may be too immature and insecure to be in a meaningful, long lasting, enduring relationship at this time of his life.  Smile, even if it kills you, smile.  Do it everyday, and one day you will be smiling and laugh again and it will surprise you when you realize that the pain is gone.  I will pray for you.  God bless you and good luck.|`|xwfm7t7Xaa	You sound just like I did once before.  I'm 25, but when I was 18 I dated this guy for a year and a half who we had known of each other b/c we had a lot of the same friends.  Anyways, after we broke up I felt the same way.  I remember sitting outside with my best friend crying how I would change anything about myself to be with this man and so on.  I remember her telling me I will be ok and I will move on, and you should never change or compromise yourself to be with someone else.  I moved on and him and I have remained friends through all this time.  I honestly believe we are much better friends than we ever were lovers.  <br>  <br>  I know its hard, but you will be ok.  Someone else will come along when you least expect it.  Maybe you don't like being alone, but I recommend being single for a little while and just having some "you" time to get yourself  back together.  I say let him go.  Something must have been missing in the relationship, and I believe things do happen for a reason.   I hope I helped
Wrf5orAuaa	Main thing is for him to get you very horny. So lots of kissing and fondling before any attempt at penetration. This will make you very wet and easy to enter.<br>  As for bleeding, don't worry about that. You can then tell him you were a virgin if you bleed. That will make him very protective of you. <br>  The only reason your first time wasn't successful is that you were probably not very aroused and lubricated, and neither was he. He wasn't hard enough to do the job.<br>  Make sure you use a contraception and if you don't know where he's been, use a condom with lubricant.|`|ZzfLnSjUaa	well i think maybe ur first guy was a virgin too because he couldnt get it in da right way.<br>  <br>  i think if u dnt want to look lyk an idiot u should get on top and get in control.u'll go how slow or fast u want and u wnt feel the pain as much, i mean ull feel it but a little less.<br>  u need an experienced guy to make u feel good<br>  <br>  have fun and hope everything goes good!!!|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	Look, for some reason the first guy wasn't hard enough to penetrate.

Once a cheater always cheats.  their guilt is not strong enough to convince them to stop cheating.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	It should. And why the hell are you cheating in the first place. Be single and date.

It won't last forever.|`|MV88rqDPaa	yes sometimes but not really|`|ygbDZPJHaa	yes but cheating should never come to mind....|`|4jCPVhYSaa	Guilt is a powerful force that can stop us from cheating. Unfortunately, human beings have a great tendency to rationalize and overcome their guilty feelings if the prize is big enough. So you definitely cannot count on guilt alone to keep anyone from cheating.

I'm sorry but the chances of finding out who, what, where, etc is protected by law and you won't be able to access his accounts.  If you must have the truth, hire Cheaters.com or a Private detective to follow his every move.  But, I'm sure you won't be happy with the outcome.  Face the facts that you already know what he is up to.  Try going to Yahoo.com People search and do a reverse phone number search and get the address.  Then confront the person at this location and ask them the truth.  Once a dog; always a dog.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	He is lying and cheating, and you know it. He got angry because he got caught.

Don't live "in a box" with him as your keeper.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	you have no choice but to get a divorce<br>  Hes looking for some one else<br>  you deserve better|`|AnW3dzQfaa	What a pig.

As long as he has never ever bruised or punched you, it might still work. Before anything else, have you ever thought of any short comings you did in your relationship to give him any reason to look for someone else? I've been married for 17 years now and our relationship had surpassed several trials already; and what I learned was in every relationship, God should always be the center of it; I also found out that in any relationship, the women are the ones that makes it work. If you love him that much, give him a chance, 10 years is still very young and there are still a lot of trials that would come your way. Just make God the center of your relationship, give due respect and trust to one another, and always keep the line of communication open.|`|djUMvICoaa	Missy you already know the answer. He's a player and now he's using you and actually abusing you.  As well as the other women.  You are now his maid to take care of all of his needs at home and he's got a string of them to take care of the rest.  Get out of it you deserve better and you don't want to catch what he might bring home sometime.  Take care of yourself and your child.  This is unhealthy place for both of you to be.  Your child is taking this all in as a way of life, is that what you want it to believe?  Don't wait any longer.   If you need a friend drop a line.  Your head has told you to go your heart doesn't want to be broken, but there is no other way.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	.first off you should have never allowed him to go to the bar. bar's are bas news for marriage's. my husband and i made the rule neither of us was to go to bars withouth the other one, but we even took it one more step to where we dont drink unless we're together. that way no accidents can ever happen. try talking to him and see if he'll change his number then quit going to bars unless your going too. i dont know if he's cheating on you, but when alcohol is involved accidents happen|`|5sdLN7vLaa	Suggest counseling to him. If he refuses, I believe he doesn't want to work on the marriage. Communication is the key and a neutral party can always help bring out the issues. <br>  <br>  Also while talking to him, try to create a distraction-free environment and talk with "I feel" statements instead of accusing him of cheating. He will only get defensive and shut down.|`|Utp2nM8waa	Forsaking All Others - remember those vows?  Your man needs other men in his life that will hold him accountable to integrity.  He needs to be a real man living in a real world with his real wife, not fantasy.  Does he have a friend or group of friends who will challenge him as only men can challenge each other?  I would enlist their help.
8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa	Men cannot be stolen.  To be stolen means that they were taken against their will.  Men can be pushed away, but they still must ultimately do the walking.  <br>  <br>  All relationships change, Honey.  They never stay the same.  They will get better or they will get worse, but they will never stay the same.  You will have periods of love for each other, periods of hate for each other, and it's during those moments that you either realize you're committed (married) and that means you work it out, or you tuck tail and run (because you were never truly committed in the first place.)  You will not ever see eye to eye on everything, no matter how alike you are.  <br>  <br>  My husband and I have been married for ten years now, and we love each other as the day is long.  We are a team, a formidable force against the world, and we have each other's backs, but . . . we argue like champions and though we are very much alike and aligned in our general beliefs, we don't see eye to eye on everything because we are two different people with two different backgrounds, with two different perspectives.   <br>  <br>  I hate to say it, but yes, you have played a part in your own troubles; how could you not have?  Unless you were in a coma and awoke to this suddenly, you are partly to blame.  <br>  <br>  If you're married to this man, tell the B**ch to F* off and tell her to find her own man.  <br>  <br>  If you're not married, let him go and learn from this so you don't make the same mistake twice.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	no you did nothing wrong when it comes to his cheating ways. i dont believe a person can ever do anything bad enough for their spouse to cheat on them..unless they had cheated themselves. but still two wrongs dont make a right. but i dont care if you hadn't given him sex for a year thats still no reason to cheat. now neglecting him from sex is wrong of you but he should have talked to you about it and you should have made a compromise. he's taking the childish way out of it by pointing the blame on you to make it easier for him.. its time for a divorce.|`|cyt7oh97aa	There is only so much a person can do.  It may take two to tango, but if this guy is blaming you for him finding someone else then forget him.  That is bull crap and he is just looking for any way possible to not feel bad about being a jerk.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Depends on if you were married to "your man".  If he hooked up with someone else, that's no ones fault but his own, you aren't responsible for satisfying every erection he has.  As an adult he should be able to exercise some control over that.  Sound like this couple has just grown apart, hopefully they are single people with no children.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	It's true that nobody can be stolen. They go willingly.  But why did he go willingly?  Because his needs were not being met in the marriage.<br>  <br>  Yes, as his partner, you played a part in it.  But you are not to blame.  HE had a choice to make - work with you to resolve the marital issue, or cheat.  He chose to cheat.  <br>  <br>  BOTH people in a relationship have to take responsibility for their part in the breakdown.  The person who cheats has to take 100% responsibility for disrespecting the marriage.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	I know you ask the ladies but I've got to throw my two cents worth in on this one. Any man who would say, much less do this, is no more than a cheat. Men can't be stolen from someone else. He was looking and likely cheating anyway. Personally I think you are better off with out him.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	no. he's a jerk. as women, we can easlily push a guy away by being moody or bickering with him. however, he chose to go to another woman. that was his decision to make and he is wrong in putting it on you.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	No one can make another person choose an action.  That's just not accepting responsibility for your actions - he cheated - its his own actions - not those of the wife.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	Sounds like he is trying to justify his actions and pin the blame on you.|`|TI65WNunaa	I have a feeling this is a question that most people wonder about.  I personally believe that if a man gets involved with another woman while in a relationship he has already made up his mind that there was things about the woman that he was interested in.  There is noway that some woman can steal a man.  I also believe that if he were being honest about everything most women would tell him to end things with his current relationship, unless it was only a sexual thing in which case he is still a liar and cheater.  Men tend to make us women feel that there was something about us that made them stray.  I feel like this if you want to chase other women be honest and leave first. CHEATING IS A CHOICE!|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Just because a couple doesn't agree on everything, doesn't mean it should be the end of the relationship.  If it is, than there was never a commitment to that relationship to begin with.  And as far as another woman taking the man away, it seems it didn't take much for him to want to leave his committed relationship.  You can't let someone take your man away if he is willing to go.  I would NEVER take responsibility for the sins or wrong doings of anyone, except my own.  For some reason, we take the wrongdoings of the man we love, personally.  We should never own the wrongs or bad things said to us as being true about us.  Being human is hard enough without taking on other people's inadequacies as our own inadequacies.  And if the man you love tries to lay blame on you for his infidelity or makes you feel that it was your fault that HE cheated, he is trying to excuse his bad behaviour instead of being mature enough to take responsibility for his own insecurities and wrongdoing.  Never take on that burden.  Each of us has enough of our own faults to deal with, without having to be responsible for another person's faults too.|`|q595MhH8aa	It takes two to tango!! But, on the other hand, I feel that you can also push your man away by your actions to where he will want to go and find someone else.  I don't believe she "stole" him, but that he was looking because maybe he wasn't satisfied for whatever reason.  That is just my opinion...I hope things workout!|`|UFOdwXgfaa	Nobody can steal your spouse away from you. It takes two to tango.<br>  <br>  He made a choice to have an extra marital affair just as you made a choice to let him go. Says allot about your relationship|`|NGKwsawdaa	Nope I wouldn't feel guilty for sh*t, they just say that another women stole them so they make you feel like you didn't do your best to try to make them happy.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	It sounds like he's trying to blame you for his unfaithfulness.  That would be the beginning of the end of it for me...|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well my husband and I think like this <br>  If we don't have anything going for us now and can be taken away from each other then it was never meant for us to be together|`|pDrkcc6taa	You have not given enough information, were you married to other?

You are in a cycle..very critical time right now..you got to get through this period..Its up to you..the professor know's you are looking at him..it show all over your face..so..My theory what ever WE..Lack we search for in our partner or someone else..to fulfill it..the problem is we ask for it from one person our mates..in some cases its asking to much..in others it's not..

But you are questioning your crush because you are married. I don't think having a crush is a bad thing. As the other writer stated, just don't feed into the temptation or put yourself in a tempting situation. You are young. Most importantly you can not let the romance in your marriage die. Do this for me....tonight, or sometime in the future (preferably within the next week) send the baby to a sitter without your husband knowing. Go to the store and pick out a nice outfit, buy some new lip gloss eyeliner, anything that will make him say "WOW!!" Then go see a movie or go out to a nice restaurant. A different spot you never been. Bring that much needed fire back! Feed each other chocolates and wine while at the table, flirt a little, feel sexy. When you get back to the house, light some candles and put on some nice lingerie, hell or even take a nice bubble bath. Anything to bring that romance back. Let the night lead you all to that special place again. <br>  <br>  Wish you the best!

I say marry her love her and the baby if he is not your son he is your brother and most likely yours after the baby is born you can have it tested to find out if you are his father or brother but either way you would love him right? at 67 your dad I am sure does not want to be a father again I mean he would be 87 when child is 20. So if you need her and obviously care about her love them both...... <br>  <br>  While the situation is not a great one at least the other man who could possibly be the father actually makes the child related to you.

Of course be prepared for her not to go if she can't afford it.<br>  <br>  I would just bring it up as if it's a given that she will contribute. When you're discussing the vacation you could say something like; " So, how do you want to split up the costs?"|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	when i dated someone and we went on trips, i split the overall cost in HALF. I didn't want to feel obligated in no way and it's only fair!!|`|2zd9OjeMaa	Vacations are expensive, I'd expect any self-respecting woman to offer to pay for some of it. If she doesn't, you need to bring it up. It's not cheap, it's treating the woman as an equal which is how they should be treated.|`|rbzoNe12aa	If I can afford it then I pay for everything.

T3b4I4kXaa	Yes, apologize and explain that your BF called the cops. Be as contrite as you can. Submit and don't defend yourself... I know that is a tough order, but it is necessary.<br>  <br>  Your goal is to get your room back, and your stuff, while you make some plans to launch out of there. <br>  Get a job and a bank account. You need some savings so you can put deposits down on your first modest apartment and utilities. If you can network a roommate arrangement, you can be out of your mom's house that much faster.<br>  <br>  If your little brother is the instigator, the best thing you can do is always be out of the house working. The more your mother has to deal with him, the better.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	At 18, if you cannot get along at home, it might be time for you to move out and start making your own way in life. <br>  <br>  And yes, you should call your mother and apologize to her. You are too old to be fighting with people. There are other ways to deal with disagreement.

vBIwaQ0qaa	My mom passed away 24 years ago. Sure, we had our arguments and spats. When I was a teen, I put the poor lady threw *ell acting all big and bad. I thought I knew everything about everything. Now, I regret being mean to her but I can't tell her as she isn't here. She wasn't only my mom, she was my very best friend in the whole world.<br>  <br>  I can understand your concern for mom's health and I admire you for that. You have to break the ice with her. Sit her down, eye to eye and tell her exactly how you feel about her and her health.<br>  <br>  Open up to her, talk to her, let her know how worried you are about her. Be nice as you talk to her and let her have her say too. Tell her how much you love her and that you want the best for her too. <br>  <br>  I wish I could turn the clock back to when I was that snot nosed little brat, my teenage years. I would do things so much differently if I could.<br>  <br>  I hope this advice helps you out. Talk to your mom, from your heart and tell her how much you worry for her.<br>  <br>  Good luck.....|`|AA12041870	I am so sorry you have to go through this.  The only person that can change your mother's behavior is your mother.  No one else can make her stop.  I think it is the alcohol telling you that she hates you as a person, not your real mother.  Bless you.  I hope this all turns out good for you.|`|chZFmJOPaa	Try contacting a rehab facility. She really does need help and it's too bad she's lost her bond with her own daughter....<br>  Theres only so much to do... if she wont accept the love and care for her, then you need to get out of the situation and let her do what she wants. If you stick around that, you're going to have a lot of problems someday. =[|`|f48277b0eedf18349f408b252bd473a1aa	If she's not willing to help herself, there is no way you can change her.  Just love her no strings attached, remind her you hate her drinking, but don't hate her.  She is obviously addicted, when someone is in the midst of an addiction like that, everything is about them and only them, so they say and do things that only benefit them at that moment, so when you talk to her, make it all about her.  Tell her how this can affect HER negatively, all the diseases and such that can kill HER, stuff like that, that should wake her up a bit.  <br>  <br>  Also in an addiction they have no respect for anything, anyone, or even themselves.  All you can really do is love her, tell her your feelings, and be there for her if/when she comes back to reality, and realizes she needs help.  <br>  <br>  And please.. NEVER, NEVER blame yourself for this, she's the one drinking, she's the one smoking, she's the one screwing up her life, none of this is your fault!  No matter what you do, it's her who is making the decision to drink like that.  <br>  <br>  Just do what you can, and live your life.  Don't make her problems yours, you love her dearly, but you need to take care of yourself first.|`|lJUyhMceaa	Where is your dad?  Do you live alone with her?  How old are you?  These are questions that we need to know in order to make good decisions.<br>  <br>  If your dad is in the picture, can he make her get some help?  Do you live alone and are you being put in danger due to her drinking?  If so, you could get a court order for her to get help.<br>  <br>  Other then that, there is not much you can do unless she wants help.  <br>  <br>  Why does she hate you?  Is she saying this because you are trying to help her?  If so, ignore her comments and keep trying to get her to get some help.  She can not stop on her own.<br>  <br>  Another thing you could do is try to appeal to one of her friends to persuade her to get help.  No matter what happens, it is going to be a long road.  Keep loving her.  You may be the only thing that can save her.|`|3dMfkdxpaa	You need to talk to as many people as you can that know her and stage an intervention. You need to remind you mum how much you love her and remind her of the good times when she was sober.<br>  I dare say she is suffereing from depression and needs medical help.<br>  dont leave it too long the quickers she gets help the sooner she gets better|`|mmrcaoUzaa	Talking to another family member who knows about her problem is a good first step. If your alone in that aspect, asking someone at school or maybe if you attend church could work too. Trying to do an intervention alone would have a very high failing rate, so choose your actions carefully. Getting one of her friends or siblings, maybe her parents, to confront her about it and explain your feelings for you would be less dangerous for you, emotionally and physically. As long as she isn't becoming a violent person, trying to talk to her first might be okay. Of course, in order for her to change, she has to want to first.|`|ZNUH7mtxaa	Please for God′s sake try to change her, my father is diagnosed for liver cancer because he used to drink alot, and now he has only a couple of months to live, it really broke my heart, so all i can say is do your best now so you wont have any regrets later, mothers and fathers only pass our lifetimes once and we should make the best of it, love your mother no matter what. hope for the best. take care and God Bless.|`|dMjqsxD3aa	get drunk with her<br>  <br>  bond together<br>  <br>  or else like send her to rehab
OwfoyXpraa	Ask around, talk to people who may know her and know where she is. For example, other old friends you've kept in contact with who knew her, her bestfriend from school.. etc.<br>  <br>  Idk, without her lastname it might be tricky finding her.<br>  Then there's always Facebook, but, like I said.. without her last name..<br>  <br>  good luck though, and I hope you find her. :)|`|uKVZVID6aa	i think try to ask of her some close friend, nearby relative etc..

NO! NO!<br>  <br>  Sorry for your sister, but it is time for her to grow up and start acting like an adult. Her life is out of control, and she is the only one who can fix it. To rescue her again, it just enabling her to continue being irresponsible. Some people just have to learn the hard way.

Though I'd be sorry about her situation, the last thing I'd want is her children running around the house uncontrolled.

U could seriously tell if a person was emo even if he/she wasn't tryin' at all (i.e, no weird hairstyle, makeup, moody..blah blah blah!!)<br>  <br>  A poser would be livin' it up with the whole emo thing and goin overboard, being loud (umm...the exact opposite), being daring (clothes.hair.makeup-wise) etc etc...<br>  <br>  There's a diffence between being an actual emo and being a wemo, well, there's a NAME for wemos and that's the SCENE thing, isn't it? Dressing up and acting emo coz, what? They think it's cool, it gives them an alter ego with which they can use to fight the world...blah blah blah..<br>  <br>  Real emos are the moody, sad (sorry, no offence intended to emos), depressed, withdrawn, cutting oneself (NOT necesarily, as i've learnt), anti social, non-LOUD person...etc.etc...<br>  <br>  But hey, if you're emo urself (are you?...lol..BUT, no offence intended of course!!) you wouldn't find these things (real emo charateristics mentioned previously) "out of the ordinary"...it helps if you look from the "normal people" side of the fence..<br>  <br>  Cheers..<br>  <br>  PS: And yes, emos write a lot!!

A month after we got married she started a whole bunch of **** talking **** about my mother went as far as being childish and writing my mother a letter about something that didn't make any sense.

And if its true get a divorce easy!|`|NoW1Prayaa	um,,,that's messed up. Why have you married her then?|`|9E54gDcLaa	Omg, Lol! Is this a real question, or a joke? Maybe if your unhappy with your wife you should spare her feelings and leave the situation. If you are stuck between a rock and a hard spot because you love her than maybe you can help her and give her motivation to better herself. Being mean will only make her eat more and gain more. If it it that bad; health threatening then maybe you should look into gastricbypass surgery. She might be too over weight and exhausted to get in and out of the tub/shower.|`|r7u2g8roaa	Your wife needs professional help....do your duty and get it for her.<br>  <br>  If you have dependant children then do your fatherly duties and remain together for the children.<br>  <br>  If your children are grown or you don't have any, get help for your wife and once treated get out of your marriage as soon as morally possible.|`|AA10600155	OMG!  That is awful!  I assume you have spoken to your wife about her lack of taking care of herself. You cannot change your wife habits or how she behaves.  Is she mentally ill?  Have you tried to get her help?  Maybe one of her girlfriends can talk to her about hygiene?<br>  <br>  On the other hand my thoughts are...<br>  I don't understand why anyone would stay in a relationship for so long.  Life is too short!  Don't say you are staying for the kids...the kids know you are miserable!<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are not in love with your wife.  You need to ask yourself what you want from life.  If it means moving out and moving on with your life then do it.|`|tYXNn1vhaa	I think we are putting way too much energy in this J/E/R/K...He is either 15 or a complete creep. He has changed his Avitar within the last hour. If this is a game that you and "Blonde Wife" are playing you  need to be reported (maybe you already have, reason for changing your Avitar)..Or you both need to get up of the couch and away from the computer and find a door and go your seperate ways. I hope there are not children involved in this mess if you are for real.|`|f3uQnod8aa	Honestly if you still love her, sit her down and talk to her...<br>  Tell her baby, this hurts me so bad but i love you and i can not see you like this anymore. it hurts me to see you unhealthy physically and hygiene-wise. What can i do to help you out and are you willing to fix this? it hurts me way to bad to let you live like this, your not just hurting yourself. then even if you not over weight start eating healthier with her and exercise with her and be compassionate. Really be concerned and sincere, so her you care she is highly depressed.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to be with her anymore hate to say it and its sad but divorce her. <br>  Good luck!|`|elx4NP4xaa	You should demand your wife to take a shower,  that is nasty.  Take her out to the back yard and hose her off.  Then tell her to get on a strict diet. If she refuses then file for divorce!|`|IBkJZ8plaa	I'm not sure what's more ridiculous--the idea that you live in a situation like this, or that you are posting on yahoo!answers for the solution.<br>  <br>  Go to counseling.|`|LMuXGkmGaa	Hmmmm, Brunette wife HAS a wife.

NSKimt1Qaa	Is this a double-entendre? Okay, you ought to know by now, she can't cook. If you want to spare her feelings, try some and spit it out when she's not looking.  The only problem is, what are you going to do when she sets a plate of it in front of you?|`|OtKCAeQZaa	It is easer not to do it they to make your self feel sick say sorry but I do not do that. I will not try it for I believe that it is wrong.

JYgJD0Rwaa	It depends on what method you use. You can use a process server, if they're busy it could take a while unless you request immediate service. You could ask a police officer to serve them, IF they do it , it will be the lowest thing on their list unfortunately. Or you can use certified restricted mail, which would likely be fastest way.|`|6927556c3325daadd25fb99fe62e7fa9aa	It depends on your courier service that you hired.

Ncad6d57aa	Confront him, and most likely he hasn't just started watching, it's probably something he's been doing but you are just now catching. It's not right fr either party in a marriage to view pornography, and it can cause major problems in your marriage. Correct the problem early on by going to couples counseling, or it'll just get worse.|`|94b8KImYaa	I would not have found out - since I would not have been routing around his laptop in the browser history to see what he was doing. <br>  <br>  And if you would have felt like watching, he would have asked me if I want to watch with him - before he started to watch.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Absolutely nothing. It's his personal business.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Seems like everyone feels the same, and they have taken the words right out of my mouth.

It's what men do. It's no big deal to me.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	Join in and watch it with him.|`|LVpyaf48aa	get a porn dvd that is similar to what he watches online and make watching it with him your friday night date!|`|yVIb7zjiaa	NOTHING .....I'd ask him how come he didn't wait for me lol..|`|u8MOrhnvaa	nothing, so what. I'd watch it with him|`|ckr2be5daa	This has happened to me many times.  First time I found it, I was upset by it.  Subsequent times, I haven't cared.  It's an initial shock but I do think most men do it.<br>  <br>  Do what I did...check out what he's interested in.  Make sure nothing weird or illegal.  In my case, it was very boring porn that my husband was looking at so I was semi-happy about that.  <br>  <br>  I've since bought him porn and we occasionally watch it together.|`|7XG5fd5Xaa	men are very visually stimulated, i wouldnt be that worried, he isnt ******* someone else. its just porn, watch with him you might enjoy it. Or if you dont like it, then ask him not to do it when your home. I dont think its that big of a deal. My fiance watches it, and sometimes i watch it with him.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Nothing.  I watch porn too and it has nothing to do with how I feel about my husband or our sex life.|`|bb6fb7d9b1792cfc88ed667c55cab4b8aa	nothing,I have no problem with him looking at porn.|`|Yd1la6mLaa	It's a very big deal for me.

Would you rather choose sides or lose both friends? Eventually you'll be forced to do either one if you keep hanging out with them. I would feel like a traitor too if that happened to me. :( But yeah if you have any other friends hang out with them I guess. Or just pick whichever friend you like better.<br>  <br>  <br>  I missed my bus today btw.
ZJkwz1B5aa	Just a communication prob.  Seems to me he thought you weren't understanding, or maybe paying enough attention to the convo.  Just ask .|`|oOwoyV1Zaa	guess he took if offensively instead of jokingly (u did mean it jokingly right?) maybe he was a bit too emotional<br>  maybe he also likes u idk<br>  hope i helped! <br>  btw try not to say too mcuh of that conversation he might just end up mad all over again!!|`|Xm4NvBPLaa	I don't think you did anything wrong under these circumstances ,well the guy hurted your feelings before so he should know that can happen it was normal he should be 'IM SORRY' and all stuff not too be like a jerk my self but I think he's not to mature over his feelings I think he should grow up he acts like brat !<br>  <br>  You know your critic was voiced in a rude way a little but he should be glad beacuse if you can criticize him in that matter that means you treat him seriously (its even in anime you know that the girl who criticize the guy very strongly in reality loves him very hard but cannot admit it)<br>  <br>  and in that message I don't get what was your fault really <br>  unless he is really in love in the girl the picture he showed to you !|`|NDwpLGHNaa	He must be on his period. lol. but maybe the saying him ****** her got him upset. wen i joke with my bf telling him that if he ****** her he gets mad. he doesnt like to b seen as doin that. which i kno he wouldnt. maybe ur friend likes you and was bothered by that. my best guess.|`|1Q7vREwzaa	I have to agree with Sam... Like you can't say "everybody know that nobody luvs u i mean duh" and be ok with it!  Poor guy..|`|LYDVekF1aa	It seems like he misunderstood you. Just tell him that you were just joking.
HiJ2xPeWaa	This is stupid..<br>  <br>  Obviously no!! whoever said the "ignorant" part is honestly the "ignorant" S.O.B!!|`|1Tdkb8OGaa	Well, seeing she didn't know I guess not.But if someone knew and corrected her I see no reason to get mad.Usually in the bottom it has the name in the other language and japanese and Korean are very different with their writing.|`|VMUwtGCuaa	i am begiining to beleive that frineds are elusive to me.god sets them up and they arent interested.|`|Xm4NvBPLaa	Leave it happens all the time !<br>  Your friend got offended and retorded back thats all<br>  its trivia she should block the guys who she dosen't like there<br>  <br>  It happens to me all the time so she really didn't do nothing wrong !<br>  <br>  She just talked to some ignorant jerks ! they're loss by the way !|`|gh2gVcESaa	I see no problem in what she said...<br>  :S
LYDVekF1aa	It sounds to me like she is just saying that for attention. Like do you ever see her eat? People i know who have had an eating disorder did not tell people. They were in denial about it. So anyways your friend might just be saying that for attention. Find out whether she is or not though...it could be that she is anorexic and that is a serious problem.

wyulHZTbaa	Since fighting does nothing you should just try to ignore her. Maybe if you just stop talking to her she will realize (hopefully) that she really does care about you. If she comes home drunk one day, lock yourself in your room or if it's still light out, go for a walk. Also, you can talk to her boyfriend about this if he's a good guy. Like you could be like, "Hey, would you mind not making my mom spend so much on you?" or something like that. And there are counselor's at school that you can talk to and teachers if there aren't any friends close enough for this kind of conversation. But for now you just have to get through it and stay strong|`|UlXZdcW7aa	Do what she is doing, fix problem right away|`|uZcHUvLpaa	I'M GOING THROUGH ALL THAT TOO!<br>  S%!& SUCKS SO BAD!|`|m8QfHC7uaa	Honey, you can't make her see it!  Do you have anyone to talk to like a counselor at school, priest at church, or a friends mother, maybe your dad? <br>  Unless she comes around, doesn't sound like things are gonna get better. You need to seek help. Are there help lines in your area that you can contact. Look in the phone book. You need counseling and fast.  Sweetie just do it.

VH4YeaZYaa	I am glad you want to help your friend. I am in the same position as your friend at the moment, the best advice I can give is pray for the person to get a job, and be her friend and encouraging. Don't always offer to pay for things for her. It can be embarssing or uncomfortable. Even though she knows you mean well. Help out money wise once in awhile but not all the time. :)|`|6GB5P7ojaa	This is a great disadvantage if you live in USA since USA is experiencing economic crisis. You can lend her some money but you have to make sure that she is capable of paying you back. Or you can tell her to borrow some money from the bank and if the bank thinks she is capable of paying back, they will lend her some money and she will have to pay either wholly or she can pay by her means.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Do not lend money or offer too, that is a nono. Invite over for pot lucks, keep your eye open for possible jobs for them.

I mean like I'm 14 and I live in a pretty good city, clean no violence and it's pretty safe for my parents to let me stay home alone, night or day. I think 14 is an ok age to stay home alone.

My parents trust me not to do anything stupid so I just order food invite some of my friends over and watch JERRY SPRINGER!! lmao love that show but ya I think you're old enough.|`|j1k8qGd6aa	Yes it's fine if you're responsible and take safety precautions.

You should not be paying for anything.  However, at the same time, you need to start respecting your parents and seeing things from their perspective a bit.<br>  <br>  Why does a 16 year old need to see a psychiatrist anyway?  Stop worrying about what others thinnk of you and respect your body for what it is.|`|OauZKhKVaa	Wow, you are definitely in the right. I'm sorry that you are being treated so unfairly, bulimia is a really serious issue and recovery is hard enough without having to pay for it. You only have 2 more years until you can live on your own. Hell, I moved out at 17 and loved it. Good luck with everything!|`|Wk80zZnNaa	Woah! talkk about drama. I think that you are on the right side. Your parents over reacted. Hey, i'm 13 rite now, i know how it is!! girl you have to respect your self! if you think you're beautiful than thats all it takes. and if you don't thinkn you're beautiful, well there are many others who do. good luck with all this stuff!|`|yT6Mezweaa	I believe your parents are wrong. Well it depends, if you work or whatnot, I think you should give like 15% to help pay for it to be courteous but even if you don't I still think your parents are wrong. It is their responsibility as being a parent not yours. Well until your 18 that is.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	For this situation I am on your side.  While you are a minor ALL of your health care expenses should come out of their pocket.  It is part of the responsibility of being a parent.<br>  <br>  Edit - some teens need to see a psychiatrist.  My niece sees one every 2 weeks or so.  She has been through more crap than most adults I know.  So, if you need to see a psychiatrist...there is no shame in it what so ever.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	How old are you? If you're under 18, they should STFU and pay the bills. If you're over 18, and they're paying a large portion of the bills...then you need to apologize and say you're grateful for them coughing up so much money, when it's really not their responsibility any longer.
f3SyOyMEaa	It wasn't you. Don't  think that every guy is going to be that way.

I had the same problem it started about 10 years ago it is call erectile dysfunction E.D. it is a male thing it is curred with viagra. The gal i was going with at the time thought the same thing that it was her so I talked to my doc and she told me all about it. I was even starting to feel self concuss about it. So don't worry it is not you .

I wouldn't be interested in you.|`|bea2c50e30c8c234aeb6e88e02424208aa	Well, you seem to be satisfied with your life thus far. I'd say, just be *honest* with the men you date, let them know that you're not looking for a serious, long term relationship. You're just a "good time girl....."<br>  <br>  I'd personally have a hard time dating you.......knowing that no matter what I did, you'd probably lose interest in a few months. That's just me, though.|`|pg0q9eoUaa	Sure hope you are using protection; if not you could be a walking disaster just waiting to happen;I don't think any guy with respect for himself would bother to be interested in dating you.<br>  You need to have some respect for yourself you sound like you are acting as a wheelbarrow.|`|meroRGRgaa	what are you talking about?!?! why would you ever degrade yourself so much as to sleep around and then brag about it. you sound like a slut and that is NOT attractive, maybe youre SO irresistable to men because you give out and they know it.. ever think of that?<br>  <br>  get some self respect.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	LOL Bill that was funny! girl you are a ****|`|R0U4qy6haa	that is 2-thnks|`|8OREBeRdaa	1) You're not true to yourself so how can you be true to another?<br>  <br>  2) "everything you were wishing for"  If you're trading guys so often, then you obviously don't have high standards.<br>  <br>  3) "Changing a partner every 14 months".  Why 14 months?  It's not like relationships have an expiry date.  I think you're just lazy and you view relationships as honestly too much work. <br>  <br>  4) You sleep w/ a guy a few wks after meeting him?  I'm not going to slander you (I'll let other people on here do that for me), but I think you should be a little choosier - especially since you're just going to dump the guy anyway.  When you tell people that he's a "dream come true", is that before or after you sleep with him?<br>  <br>  5) Ok not staying single for more than 2 months, is not necessarily a sign of being irresistible.  It's a sign that you're so uncomfortable with being by yourself that you're absolutely petrified to be alone.  You obviously don't have the inner strength and character to be independent and therefore you feel the incessant need to have a relationship so that you can somehow, in a perverse fashion, find some individuality.  <br>    The fact that you think you're irresistible is just a sign that you're acting like a conceited, self-righteous, pompous, arrogant, snobby, superficial princess.  I didn't say you are one, I said you are acting like one. <br>  <br>  6) You almost cheated on your bf? Hello!!!! Warning bells here.  I wouldn't want to be with someone that 'almost' cheated on me.  If he was 'wrong' for you then break up with the guy.  How hard is that?<br>  <br>  No I wouldn't date you.  One half of me wants to just verbally take you apart for acting so foolish but I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt.<br>  <br>  You're obviously confused. You don't need someone else to substantiate your feeling of self-worth. Do yourself a favour and work on your own character.  Then I'm sure one day, you'll find the true "dream guy".|`|Tq6R4DN3aa	i think you are sexually active .you are not a steady person .that will course a problem in the Future for example me >> i was and still like that but know i have a gf that i leave with for 7 months.we plan to get married this year .the problem she is so pressuring me about that ,and i'm not ready for that because i still like f....ing around and i think my life will not be the same because again once i marry her.<br>  <br>  coming back to your ? .i would date you for sex only and no feelings involve because of you  are a 1 cheater 2 sexually active and 3 frick .<br>  <br>  i need your reply back to madoda.nkabinde@yahoo.co.uk
REoNMbanaa	she's acting this way to deal with the stress in her life. try waiting for a day when no ones home except the two of you and try catching up with her and telling her wats going on in your life lately. she probably feels as if you're siding with your dad. try descretly telling her that you love both of them equally and your not on anyone's side. maybe you two need some bonding time. try going on a shopping trip or out to lunch with her. she wont feel like she has to reel her daughter back in. <br>  also, try to remember her boundaries. if she looks annoyed or angry, try to just give her some space instead of hugging her.|`|fEwbq4Kgaa	Well I'm sure there's a reason behind all of your parent's actions that you just don't understand at the time.

I'm sure there are many kids in the same boat with you.|`|8U0Wtop2aa	Try to talk to your dad about it.|`|e6jrBORRaa	It sounds like your Mom is stressed to the gills and may not even realize what she is doing to you.  It sounds like a combination of the problems she has with your father and perhaps a job that is stretching her thin.  I know I found myself responding differently to my 2-year old son because I'm stressed about being laid off.  I have to make a concentrated effort not to get too overwhelmed by his demands and treat him with as much patience as I usually do.<br>  <br>  Have you tried just pulling her to the side and talking one-on-one with her about how you feel?  If you feel that is too tough to do, write her a heart-felt letter similar to what you typed for us here and give it to her.  You two need to talk to each other and work on becoming closer somehow.  If she realizes exactly how you feel, she will probably make more time for you.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with this.

WQiD6aMZaa	I do believe in a connection between mother and child.  Everyone has abilities to be connected with people, but relations are even greater and make themselves more known simply because they are related.  Check out www.moonlitdreams.net to learn more.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	Well... I've actually met some people who have had experiences I can't discount that would support a bond.  And I've met many more who have no connection with their mother.  I've known many a mother who notes when her child is upset, even when they're trying to hide it, or something is just 'off' and it seems almost psychic (though someone could argue that it's more to do with how involved she is with her offspring.)  <br>  <br>  So... I do believe it happens, but I believe it's a small minority of people.|`|GKPY3t56aa	No I don't believe that there is a supernatural bond. I think that the bond comes with time.

6d0iJ4RQaa	You sound like you are trying to get on with your life, and that is the right thing to do.  Truthfully, I believe you asked a question like this before, you are doing the best thing you can, IGNORE HIM!  He is obviously a complete weirdo with low self-esteem.  You seem like you are trying to go on the right track with your life, and if you keep up with ghetto trash complaining about his baby's mama, and why you keep jockin' him like Jay-z, then truthfully your going to be stuck in a rut for your entire life.  Ignore him, you are doing the right thing, and just keep it up.  If the harassment continues, then you might have to escalate the situation, A. you might need to change your number, that should do the trick because he obviously seems like somebody who can't think his way out of a box.  B-If he knows where you live, then on some occasions, if the person is unable to contact you via telephone, then try to come by your house, so prepare yourself for that if the situation does escalate.  C-If B occurs, then go to the police and get a restraining order against him.  If this is the same guy you had asked about 2 weeks ago, then he has a very abusive personality.  Usually people with these types of personalities turn minor inconvenient harassment to physical abuse.  Usually individuals with this type of personality turn emotional and mental abuse to physical abuse.  Not only do you want wannabe 50 cent out of your life for the obvious reasons, that he prob smokes blunts and plays XBox all day, and not Xbox360 cause he can't afford it but XBox, but you want to keep him out of your life for this same reason.  You are doing the right thing by ignoring him, but you might need to take it to the next level, first just hang up with you hear it his him or his friends, and if it continues then you might have to change your number, continue the escalation from there.  That's truthfully the best advice I can give, I occasionally do counseling and I have seen numerous cases where simple harassment turns into a severe sexual assault, so please be careful....|`|tU5NJVL3aa	He just needs to grow up.  You do to, if you are letting childish things like this bother you.  <br>  <br>  [adding]<br>  Just curious, what does "he kept calling me out of my name" mean , and why were you on the phone with him?|`|aLgY4l3Naa	Sounds like he has a lot of growing up to do!! Don't give him the time of day, if you need to block him from your phone and don't take any phone calls you don't know, ignore him if you see him anywhere, pretty soon he will get the hint and leave you alone!! Just live your life, be happy and confident with who you are and you will meet someone more mature and respectful to you!! If you acknowledge this guy in anyway he will just keep on, so be strong and do what you need to so that he can get the hint and make no mistake about it!! Good luck to you!!
3swZV9uUaa	ok what you can do if this would ever had happend to you was that you can tell your parents/ phone company to block the number and they can stop texing you/ calling you and if you know dat person then just have a lil 101 with them after school or lunch(: thats what i would have done lol :D|`|FJIT0pEZaa	text him to stop if it didnt work tell your pqarents and they'll no what to do or change your number|`|s2DzUnhFaa	if it hasn't happned then don't worry about it|`|ktDZjbH7aa	HI XXX JOYFULL,,,I WOULD CALL MY PHONE COMPANY,,AND TELL THEM,,,TO BLOCK HER ,,,,I DID,,N,,, THEY DID,,,,PEACE|`|1NSmBMjJaa	yeah...<br>  <br>  it's just my dumb friends giving my phone number to these kids at my school!<br>  <br>  i just tell that person to knock it off or i'll kick their ***! >:||`|68CpnNplaa	call your company and get them to block your number or if worst comes to worst change your number|`|i6jT4rpOaa	cuss them out(:<br>  and if it hasnt happened, whats the problem here? you're lucky.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	You would call your cell phone company and have their number blocked.

MKHd10MYaa	Yeah, just not close friends. If we're only friends, I wouldn't expect them to be like committed to me or something and call me often. They have their life and perhaps I just wouldn't be someone important to them in their life too much, but it doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  Friends are friends. Friends aren't your boyfriend/girlfriend. You shouldn't expect them to keep in touch too often, that's their choice.|`|ns1F0p8Laa	I would still be friends with that person.  I dont talk to my friends everyday which make our bond even tightier.

For example, is this person far away? Is this person working or is usually busy?<br>  <br>  Or do you think the person have the opportunity to call you more often?<br>  Also, if you are really interested in this person you could call and encourage the person to keep in touch. Friendship is not a one person thing but it incorporates everyone in the relationship.|`|WSQSbZPsaa	Of course I'd still be their friend.  I'm actually one of those people who can rarely call.  It's not that I don't want to talk to my friends, but I don't have a lot of time to be making lots of phone calls with my school projects and regular daily requirements.  <br>  <br>  Try to discern between someone who just hasn't had the time yet to get in touch or someone who just isn't really fond of talking to you, though.|`|Oxwi4YbUaa	yeah, my best friend and i communicate like that, and we've been even closer during the time i haven't seen him, because when you finally see that person, its so much more special and you have a lot to tell each other about|`|6PoonTIEaa	err, yeah i would. i'm not gonna lie, i just hate talking on the phone, and so do a lot of people. lol! so as long as i saw them and talked to them, then yeah XD
IhLUgRIAaa	Fix it with a mannerly way. She should understand how crazy your life his right now by how long you guys known each other. Maybe she can take part in helping you with the wedding, like dress shopping and include her in some of your plans when you can. the ones you think that will make your relationship better. and don't uninvite her to your wedding. that will just make things worse.
0PdYYeBFaa	1. Our outlook on life, aspirations and wants to accomplish, attain a good education that would better our future careers. Also help with other things we aim to share and contribute.<br>  <br>  2. Via phone...mostly my husband and I text as we both have a busy periods. My husband is in the finally year of his joint degree where dissertions are apparently mentally, physically and emotionally draining. So i try to respect and understand this and look for an alternative communication mode that will not disrupt him and vice versa with me. I am doing a joint degree but i am in my second year but the course is very intense. So we have established connecting in this manner via having awareness, understanding and a method of suitable communication.<br>  <br>  3. I have learn't with the present situation even though we may not be closely connected, I try to understand he is trying to establish a better future for himself. I respect as his wife that him doing well will be a bonus to our relationship as he will be mentally, emotionally well as i care about his wellbeing. In regards to the moments we have together, I try to introduce activities that will require both our participation and will stimulate us both e.g. board games like scrabble, monopoly; outdoor activities - basketball, football; xbox and playstation games that requires two players etc. (Well some of these i have not done, but will be doing soon as you have to revitalise the marriage).<br>  <br>  4. Well communication helped me feel like we were a team, helping and being of support where needed. In regards to looking out for my interests which i am doing now, I am going to engage in past hobbies i neglected i.e. basketball, iceskating; socialising with friends; and attaining my goals. My individual interests that i have is what i hope we will be able when time is better to share with each other and vice versa with his interests.<br>  <br>  5. I try not to think in a negative way. The past few weeks my husband and I have been bashing heads. I didnt realise how consumed i was in just thinking of me and totally dismissing this as a time we are both trying to prosper for the better making of our future. Especially taking into account that the economy is in a mess...so using this time to find and stablize ourself will be through career driven prospects by thinking positive. Due to attention being on the nature of work and studies not taking to this as a negative but a positive in both of us trying to achieve for the better making of the life we want to have with the least amount of struggles.<br>  <br>  6. I am currently at this stage of trying to find a solution to deal with us currently bashing heads with each other. Well i have looked at this as weighing scale of: Worthy vs. Unworthy. My husband is a blessing to me and is worthy to me and in regards to things i do not agree on it is just a mere idea. In regards to love, although it is a complex...I am a person who did not marry him because i was in love with love, but because i was in love with him. Being in love with my husband is loving him of good and the faults we each have in our own self..as no one is perfect. He is the perfect (of good and areas of fault) i am content with.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Too many questions, I can't think about all this tonight.|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Good heavens, I got to we vs. me by not over analyzing everything.

Let them go and make a new life.<br>  <br>  Have fun being misserable for the next few years instead of making new friends and going out and having a life.<br>  <br>  I have moved four times, twice in the past three years, and each and every time I went and made new friends. I lost some old ones, but I always gained new ones. The last time I moved, I only had three days or else I wouldn't have anything for two months due to work and travel. So, I actually do know something about moving and leaving people behind. Like I said, have fun being misserable and making yourself sick.<br>  <br>  And don't bite off more than you can chew. Didn't think I would be someone who moved hu?|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Are you there with your parents? Are they there for work or something?<br>  <br>  You being there is not permanent. If you feel like you belong in your home state you can return - even if you have to wait a few years. It's not forever.<br>  <br>  Also make sure you keep in contact with your friends however you can - skype, facebook, email, phone - keep in touch because they will make you feel a bit better. Maintain the friendships and when you come back they will still be there.<br>  <br>  I know people whose parents were successful businessmen and they had to live in about 8 different countries growing up. Try to also see the positives in being exposed to different cultures - it will make you a more interesting, well travelled person.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Also Tommy Lee seems to have nine lives and can drink as much as he wants and still survive. I bet he'll still be alive in five or ten years.
3reHk4I1aa	she does it becase she has likes to brag A LOT and i think that maybe sheis a little over ocofident. i have a friend but she is no where near as bad as yours. the reason i think that she has a lot of confidence beacse her parents give her everything and maybe they would always tell her tht she is pretty and beautiful so i think sh ethought that it was ok to say things like that about herself. i think that when she does talk about this kindof stuff you should like change the subjecdt to something else or ignore her and hopefully she will get the picture|`|0cHvwg1xaa	dude is she lez???<br>  anywho, two of my friends are the same way, I just ignore it, or if you really want to knock them down a notch, tell them<br>  'dude, really....ur not that pretty' <br>  but thats only if you dont want to be there friend anymore, she might be selfconscious, and braging about herself makes her feel better.|`|IDbZ1E6Haa	She obviously has low self-esteem.

If I were you, I'd just feel sorry for her.|`|D5AWihKXaa	you basically need to tell her that she talks too much about herself. That's all you can do. If she gets mad .. oh well. At least you're honest.|`|R0o5rvpGaa	my sister was in this kind of a situation... <br>  One day her friend was talking about her self for hours and wouldn't listen to anyone else so my sister said...<br>  "Lauren (her friends name) you need to stop obsessing over yourself and think about someone else for a change.... ask them how their day was or something... you just keep going on and on about yourself and it gets annoying so stop!"<br>  <br>  Just talk to your friend....|`|LVpyaf48aa	tell her she should be a model. help her set up a photo shoot with a pro photographer and submit photos to a real model agency.<br>  <br>  only about 1% of girls who try modeling are successful so maybe if she gets lots of rejections from the 'pretty people' she will reaize she aint all that. lol
OwfoyXpraa	Well, if you walk by him in the hallway, you could be like, "hey, great job in the football game last night," and smile at him, or wish him luck, etc.<br>  <br>  Talk to him like you would talk to any other ordinary friend. Make small talk. (:<br>  Don't put yourself down. I've never seen a picture of you and I can tell you're beautiful. Think about it: do your friends care if you're so-called "ugly"? Do they care if you could lose a few lbs? No. Because they're your friends. And if this guy ends up not liking you because of your appearance, than he's not the type of guy you should be daydreaming about. He should treat you with respect and like a friend.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry if that was harsh or anything.. and good luck hun. (:|`|PezEPqYjaa	ask him to eat lunch with you when you see and found out what he like and go from there
3NoQuoWuaa	The older people become, the less age difference impacts society. Some people would have a problem with a 30 yo (male or female) making out with a 18 yo. (male or female) And almost every country has harsh laws dealing with 16 and younger. But almost no one has a problem with a 50 yo and a 30 yo or even larger differences. It has to do more with maturity than chronological age.r|`|UBFGCvVOaa	Assuming your dad was 18 when he graduated, that would put your mom in 2nd grade or so...<br>  <br>  Hair-splitting aside, there's no reason for an 11-year age gap to be wrong.  My grandmother was 20 when she married my 30 year old grandfather.|`|45UTKuamaa	Age is just a number and they don't always add up, but to two people who truly care about each other the numbers are always right on matter what they are|`|EY0wnkh3aa	Omg no way my parents are like that too!!

You have to look at how happy she is with you, how slutty she is, and unlimited other factors. There just isnt a way to say how likely it is that any given girlfriend will cheat on you because people are so different. What you need to do is be honest and open with your lady and deal with that problem if/when it ever arises.|`|WKBVrHhbaa	Well, if you two are in a serious committed relationship and she loves you then there are no chances.<br>  If you guys just started dating, then the chances are THERE, but she may or may not take them.<br>  <br>  It all depends on her feelings towards you, and her history. If she has cheated on long term bfs before, then be alert.|`|eknuWrLLaa	Because of the fact that u are worried, (save the "i DO trust her" crap 4sum1 who believes u lol cuz if u did, u wouldnt b on yahoo asking!!) that gives your girl about a 70% chance of cheating cuz she seems like the type of girl u should b worried about....unless of course you're just super insecure...|`|GXhSvW2daa	My friend i have the same Problem i just hope that never happends lool but its life :D lifes boring without things like this happening LOL Dw you be fine but the chances are actually high but depends on the girl Too :) but party girls do anything ANYTHING !!!!|`|7OHH9tUeaa	Depends on if she's involved in alcohol, etc. or if she's wild and crazayyy.

Does She Get Drunk...?|`|yoqiYBasaa	Coming from a girl who used to get drunk and cheat at parties (hold your judgment, I'm older and wiser now). Alcohol and drugs played a big factor. They tend to make you act happier or bolder maybe even flirtier. Cute guys who are paying attention to her, if she isn't used to getting male attention, she may really like it and start flirting. Or if she feels your relationship is lacking she might start looking at mr. cute party guy as potential future boyfriend material. She may start looking for what you are not giving her in somebody else, and it is usually attention. Just make sure before she goes to the party, you give her a good long kiss and tell her how beautiful she looks and how lucky you are to be with her. and then tell her you hope she has a good time. that cuts down the risk by a great deal.|`|w3XlaAmSaa	the chances of her cheating on you are not that much because.

OegheALwaa	ha ha this sounds really familiar to me, except it was a guy and he was really competitive. he would yell and scream and cuss. he was a cool guy but he had anger issues. <br>  just tell her to stop being like that and to knock it off because it not cool. she will probably grow out of it like the kid i knew.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	Oooh! Be SUPER sweet to her. If she misses it, say,"Oh, It's okay, you'll get it next time!" When she's mad say,"There's no reason to be mad. We all mess up." Smile and encourage her.

rCvA7dDyaa	Do something! Talk to her. Ask her what's up. Keep in touch. Hang out once in a while.

DJ7c3Ab2aa	Unfortunately I doubt that there will be anything you can do to get these girls to leave you alone.  You could talk to your parents about changing your phone number.  You should ask your parents to think about this logically.  You said that the prank calls took place at night.  How many doctor's offices do you know of that are open past 5:00pm?  Hell, I've had to deal with doctors plenty, and I've never gotten a call from them after normal business hours and it's not like you'd go to the ER for a pregnancy test. You could talk to the police about tapping your phone so that any incoming prank calls will be investigated by them.  On the other hand, getting the police involved might get you harassed more at school.  <br>  <br>  As much as I want to say to go to an adult at the school, chances are it will just make things worse.  The adult will talk to the kids you say are involved, and that will probably be the end of it from their end... the kids on the other hand, will want revenge for you telling on them.  What kind of low class scum of a guy picks on a girl anyways?!  What a loser.  <br>  <br>  I think what might help you is to join a club that shares your interests.  That will help you meet people who should have more in common with you and hopefully make better friends.  Maybe keep yourself surrounded by other friends, instead of hanging out alone at lunch.  They will be less likely to approach you if they think other people might have your back... except when they might be trying to turn your new friends against you by making you stand out.  There have to be some good decent people in that school for you to meet!  I hope you do find them... real friends who you can actually count on to be there for you.  It might take a little time, but don't give up hope!  I hope things turn around for you soon,|`|ZX8gOyfTaa	well if that's your picture you're very pretty maybe they're jealous x] and tell your parents everything so they can expect stuff like this, also make new friends they're not worth it|`|Ddfff5psaa	Oh my gosh sweetie! I'm so sorry! =( That is terrible, those girls are evil, high school is so rough.  If I were you I'd go to my councilor or the principal and explain EVERYTHING, and REALLY talk to your parents and tell them everything.  This is a form of hazing and harassment, they could even be put in jail, suspended, and put into alternative education for this.  You NEED to tell someone.  I'm so sorry, I promise it will get better but promise me you will tell someone.  I just graduated and I never dealt with anything that bad, but I somewhat have been through a situation where I was singled out.  That guy had no right to do that to you.  That is considered a threat, and he will be suspended for sure, you need to tell someone, and maybe consider switching schools.|`|pfke6Jieaa	well i read your story and u know idk what to say. people can be jerks and make an @$$ outta themselves. i think they are just picking on you because you are alone and so you would stand out to them. i remember when i was in high school when i was alone they would do those things to me too. <br>  <br>  maybe its a lil hard to make friends at ur school but if u really look u r gonna be surprised at how many good ppl there r. i know its hard especially when u r alone but what u need to do is find someone who shares the same interest as you and go from there. and make sure they are a good friend not just pretending. i gotta say im speechless that even that guy spit on you. that is the most disgusting thing to do. <br>  <br>  my advice to you is be your self always and dont let them get to you. as soon as you let them then they are gonna keep doing it. if you wanna transfer schools too that would be a good idea. those people are nothing but trouble. keep ur head high and just remember ur there for u, not for them. ur a young girl so im sure u will find lots of friends. u have a lot of time ahead of u dont worry about them.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	Wow. That's dreadful! If you see those girls, aviod them. You could try completely ignoring their existence. If the come up to talk to you, walk right past them staring straight ahead giving no sign of recognition. Also, stay with groups of people that you do know. I think that they might be jealous of you for some reason. You don't see bullies going through all of this trouble on kids who are labeled "nerds" do you? Someting is motivating this.|`|wyulHZTbaa	im so sorry! that must be horrible for you to deal with and put up with. but the best thing to do is just ignore them and find other people to hang out with. like at lunch. instead of sitting alone sit with someone from one of your classes that you sort of you know. you two might end up being good friends, plus being excepted into someone else's circle gives you people that will fight for you if these two girls start bugging you again. just stay strong. you'll get through it!
fxF2oraPaa	just go to her place to make out; she likes you, so she probably wants it
HiJ2xPeWaa	Probably he expresses better in writing?

Make a move man! Go get him!|`|ZX8gOyfTaa	lol since I sometimes do this x] it means he's nervous/intimidated to say something because he doesn't want to look dumb
qxlvhk52aa	don't expect anything too formal. just bring proof of income, living expenses, and proof of any other expense you have regarding your lil' one. usually you send those things in to whoever's responsible for your case file so you may not have to bring much. don't be nervous! i've gone before and you sit in a room until your name is called. then your lawyer/rep takes you aside and asks if you agree with the proposed amount and you sign papers. very easy and painless.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Bring whatever documentation you have regarding his time with the child.  Bring whatever documentation you have regarding anything he has paid into your home for the child.  Bring whatever proof of your income you have.  Bring whatever proof of his income you have.<br>  <br>  Don't worry.  The state attorney is basically representing you by representing the state interest here in having the father support your child instead of the state.<br>  <br>  Don't say anything unless you're asked.  Don't look at him.  Don't let him intimidate you into any embarrassing outbursts.  There's no emotional issues here.  It's all cut and dry--it's a child the two of you made and he will have to pay support.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	They are going to ask about how much he makes and see if he should pay or not, and if he does, how much will be deducted from his paycheck.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	pay stubs if you have any. maybe want to bring proof of your house payment or rent. Mainly they will want the fathers income so if you have proof of that, that would helpful too. It doesn't matter if you were married or not. bring the paternity results too. nothing to be nervous about
3f04d9ffb6ff4f3a0291d329acc40e45aa	Hm, well i don't really know. If there isn't any medical problem with him then yall should be in the bedroom getting naughty lol... i wish you luck. I know you  have already asked him and everything but tell him how you feel, that you think he is cheating etc...|`|DzAFT8VDaa	Ugh! It sounds like he's either looking at a LOT of porn or cheating because he is mentally out of the relationship. If he's gone so far as to put his profile online in the past, that should tell you everything. He can't be trusted #1 and you deserve WAY better.  Don't waste your life on someone who isn't interested. You can find a man who will treat you right.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|xxkL46Yaaa	generally where there's smoke there's fire...There are red flags there!

zdu3gh8jaa	Hi there Scott,<br>  As you have found out, when a relationship becomes sexual you are dealing with a whole different set of emotions. What you are feeling right now is normal - don't feel stupid about it. You need time to 'grieve' for the loss of the relationship which you had with this girl. Try to be kind to yourself and don't beat yourself up over it. It's hard when your heart is broken even if you split for all the right reasons. Well done to you for not staying with someone who had no respect for your feelings - remember that for any future relationships that you have, do not ever allow anyone to disrespect you. My advice would be not to contact this girl again, if you see her when you are out and about and she speaks to you, then be polite and curteous and leave it at that. Give yourself some tlc and get out there with some of your friends, I'm sure it won't be too long before another young lady comes along to help 'heal' your heart. Good luck, and may your future be filled with an abundance of love, joy and happiness.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.   :-)|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Im pissed right now|`|vuEyUbsgaa	you know what you did the right thing if you aint got respect in a relationship then it aint worth nothing. I know you're hurting right now but a few weeks down the road you'll find yourself a new girl and you'll be thinking why you didnt leave your ex earlier you could have had a better relationship sooner. Anyways dont even be chasing after her not even to try to be a friend ignore herlet her to be the one who chases after you. If you keep trying to talk to her when she doesnt want to talk to you it will just push her away even more|`|qqLcvDDKaa	Let it go, try not to think of her again. But you can still be friends with her, just try to end all animosity between you and her. But if she doesn't want to even be friends then, you probably just have to let it go.|`|c62834fb987b5e7827aa301e5b872d10aa	You are not stupid for calling her, no. All she might need is time if even she does want to stay friends with you. My now ex-fiance broke up with me last friday and i am too VERY sad and depressed. We were to get married this July. We fought a lot as well. Every day, but I never saw it coming. He never seemed unhappy with me nor did he ever come up to me to talk with issues he had. We both thought we had the greatest love in the world and were soulmates. However, it always seemed that I put a lot of myself into the relationship and he didn't. He told me when he broke up with me that he has been wanting to do it for quite sometime, and that he never loved me. THAT hurt a lot. And he sent me confused signals. Like he tried to kiss me still to save the relationship. At the same time, he said he wanted to go to his old life and that he was done with me. AND, he didn't want to stay friends unlike with his other exes. He said if we did, it would only be out of charity for me. He was a real jerk to me that day and after when i tried to contact him, but i still deep down love him. He owed me money too to which he later said "I don't have to pay you. Where is the proof?"  He left me with a wedding dress that can't be returned and a car that I had bought for him to use when he needed it. Sorry to make this so long. I just need someone to talk to. I lost my friends because of him. As far as you and ur ex go, if she wants to stay friends with you, she will. Just give it time and see what happens. Good luck.
rPaKkzzTaa	Well to be honest me and my bestfrannd get into alot of these kinda fights and well we just try to talk it out.Even if yall aint really bestfrannds just talk it out try to say your sorry.In the end it will all work out.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	Apologize.|`|y8dTsfdxaa	ok honestly i think that is such an immature thing for you to do!<br>  when you get in a fight with someone those problems are between you two..im not saying to not talk to your friends about it but honestly grow up ok! <br>  im not saying you told your friend sidney to tell her off but you should of told your friend to not do anything about it to not get involved<br>  you want your friend back now? haha you should of thought about that before you gave the number to sidney!<br>  <br>  every girl has done this before and its happened to every girl before but there comes a time to realize that you have to act more mature about the situation!<br>  <br>  go apologize and pray to god that she will forgive you|`|7a3dbb579b24e4b9fdf411db3dd96edaaa	I m going to start off with thats very petty and you should just grow up. if you and another friend get into it then thats between yall and friends go argue so by you letting her do that is childish to me. but get over it and all yall just be friends..|`|8gyaS3mGaa	explain that u did not know that she was going to call her names. tell her how sorry u r and u really do miss her. maybe she will accept her apology nd if she does not than you don't need a friend like that anyway.|`|LYDVekF1aa	Give each other time so you aren't so angry anymore. Then say you are sorry and try to work thinks out.
kgfcc4PUaa	yeah stand u to her and get some new friends who care about you.|`|LYDVekF1aa	I can understand why you are mad. If it is a true friend then they shouldn't make all of your friends hate you or put you down all the time. Just tell your friend how you feel. Then reevaluate your friendship.|`|a516a8e6388538f5bf24f7b8eda9e6aaaa	yes i would be mad<br>  i think that you should tell her that you don't like her bragging about things and it hurts when she says stuff like that, either she'll get it or she won't and you should stop being her friend since she doesn't seem to act like your friend|`|p0ivDX5uaa	It's obvious she isnt even your friend.<br>  Friends don't treat you like that, so yes I would be mad.<br>  She's degrating me to make herself feel better!
c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	id say so..she seems to be interested in what you like about her...take a shot at it.|`|fMEypXDYaa	I don't know, why don't you ask her instead? Just state your feelings to her and see what she says back to you.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	She likes you~! I'm a girl so trust me on this one. Take her to a nice dinner, movie, and a park. That way, you have plenty of time to get to know each other. But it sounds like you're halfway there! Good luck.|`|0dbDQh8Haa	she's giving you a chance, so she obviously is atleast a little bit interested! congrats! but you have a good shot at this, don't mess it up!|`|23f7be6415d7965c88f38a51d089c640aa	YOU MAY ASK THIS THING TO HAVE CUP OF TEA AND SEE MOVIE ETC.|`|AA11108018	Looks like is in stars for you|`|T1vgsbyKaa	I think you have a shot, but you should have approached her differently. Girls like it when you go for their personality and not their looks, and by the sound of you post, it seems like you made it pretty obvious that it was looks that you were going for. In my opinion, you may have taken it too fast, if you don't really know her that well. Since you already told her how you feel, I think you should still go for it and hope for the best! Remember though, people are a lot different online then they are in person, so be careful of that. Hope all goes well for you and this girl!|`|qfSKgxDsaa	You might should have not said "true personality"  because not all people fake at school and that could be the real her and she could have mis-construed that for you saying that you didn't like her personality...BUT I understand what you mean.  Ask her out to do something simple and fun, i.e. rollerbladding, bowling, maybe a movie (though you can't really talk in a movie but still) and see what happens :)|`|BdvGQAqhaa	Yes,you have a shot as you two are communicating a lot even if online and I'm sure it will lead to in person alot sooner or later. If she wasn't interested in you at all you'd not be even talking online as she wouldn't waste her time talking to if she had no interest in you.|`|cubhDLkWaa	Think of the movie, "Hitch." He has a good philosophy. "Basic principles: No matter what, no matter where, no matter who, any guy has a chance to sweep any woman off her feet. He just needs the right broom." Any guy has a chance with any girl. Remember that.|`|XwMn6aY5aa	yup if she asked you what you like about her personality..she just wants to get to know you too..go on a date or sit with her at lunch only you too and talk or ask her out to the movies..|`|M76HtRucaa	You definitely have a shot.  Be a gentleman!!|`|aJZVwEAsaa	Well she didn't kick you in the nads and file a restraining order. So it's looking pretty good so far. Keep it up.|`|6a23d4378fc62f24a25913afcd956609aa	well if she's willing to go for it then you should too!!!!!<br>  gud luck!|`|Wnubypltaa	If she agrees to talk to you online or whatever, then that must mean that she does have an interest in you, i think you should go for it. <br>  Get to know her a bit more, and if you think she's starting to like you back, then ask her out.|`|euJrvVcPaa	eh im not quite sure. but when u guys hang out ask her alot of things about her self. so i think u guys should hang out like at lunch or something.|`|jB2p4fSmaa	I think she likes you but wants to get to know you more.|`|vKctajqiaa	Yep u deifinately got a shot but its not a sure thing so u better make ur move quick|`|wFBaJUwIaa	Yes she's interested. Play it cool then you got her for good.|`|FZYCouSeaa	well mabie lets see how it turns out|`|35pHRf2caa	yes.

Tell the ex to get lost and drop your fascination about your present one and leave and find someone who cares about you<br>  <br>  Thomas|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	I am figuring you cheated on your husband with this part-time boyfriend only to find out that the PT boyfriend does not want to make you his wife.  <br>  Well, tough, cheaters never win.<br>  You need to clear your head, up your standards and hopefully find someone who will respect you and love you.|`|xWtW2kHraa	"Angel of Death" aye??? Well-chosen name for what you are into!<br>  <br>  Its confused women like you that really frustrate men!!<br>  <br>  And just why do you care about your EX husband's feeling towards you?<br>  He is you ex, right?|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Get some counseling! Spend sometime alone learning to be happy with self. Then you will be able to have a relationship and value yourself enough to accept love.|`|dTaGzh6Haa	Lose them both. Start over slowly with someone you truly admire and vice versa.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Now you get to find out men prefer younger women before settling for a vibrator ?|`|AA10093500	What's the big dilemma?  lol You break even, but more importantly....why do you look at this like it's a game....or a score?<br>  <br>  I think it's sad.|`|874EAxkfaa	just like a dog chasing it's tail.your there.|`|WtT2awPmaa	you sound like you need some "me" time and that's exactly what i suggest you go do .. get over you're part-time bf cause that doesn't sound healthy and it would probably be a good idea to just leave your ex alone because that's not fair to him .. go on a cruise .. get a new hobby where you meet once a week w/ new people .. do something for you and celebrate yourself and who knows ?? you may meet someone new ..|`|TZ815QKDaa	You need to put your energy into one person..or get rid of both of them and find someone new.|`|FyR1NAQwaa	wow read you question  EX AND PART TIME   stop seeing them both and move on in life|`|Yd1la6mLaa	Love yourself.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	You don't want to be with someone you don't love. You don't want to be with someone who doesn't love you. <br>  <br>  I'd suggest that you stop wasting any more time and keep looking for someone you can love, who will love you.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Stop talking to both of them and find a man that loves you and you love him.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	This is just ridiculous.  lol  Your ex husband is irrelevant.  Ignore the poor guy and hopefully, he'll move on.<br>  <br>  The part-time boyfriend--what is this exactly?  lol  I'm not familiar with the concept.<br>  <br>  How about trying the "alone and on your own" thing for awhile--find yourself.  When you are ready to stop calling yourself "Angel of death," maybe you'll be ready for a relationship you can give 100% of yourself to.|`|I814g6ZBaa	If you have children you're going to have to see the EX -- so just keep being civil to him and be glad that he has affection for you & doesn't want to do the horrid stuff other have to suffer through.<br>  If you don't, just nicely tell him "no thanks, we're ex's for a reason..." & leave it at that.  Why go on & on & on... ya know?  <br>  The BF, well... you can only do so much, Honey.  It isn't worth twisting yourself into knots and ruining your mental health over something that just ISN'T there. <br>  Maybe you should just cool it for a while with him and spend time with friends or see other people.<br>  He might realize that what the two of you had together was worth it...<br>  OR you might find Mr. Can't Live Without You.  <br>  Good Luck, Sweetie!!!!  :)|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Get into some serious counseling|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	walk away and leave them to their own devices
kZRTekoJaa	well he's entitled to his own opinion, just as you are.<br>  i'm pretty sure studies have shown that children fare better later in life when raised in two parent households, and are usually in trouble more when they come from "broken homes".<br>  <br>  however, that is not the case 100% of the time. if you're mom raised you well as a single parent and you don't feel the least bit "slighted" by it then that is wonderful and he can save his preaching for someone who agrees with him. don't let what he said get to you.|`|dcd11iUwaa	honey dont ever let anybody tell you that you NEED a man, you dont need anyone<br>  its when your ready to open up and share your life with someone, and that partnership can blossom into a MUTUAL needing and want, that is when you should have a relationship|`|QygWa2Dpaa	He is a dumb guy. That's why.|`|JRKJ1w3Zaa	that's just a general assumption. But it's not entirely true.<br>  <br>  there are responsible kids in that kind of situation who are aware and intelligent.<br>  <br>  my parents don't have the best relationship and I want to be environment geologist<br>  <br>  I am a well behaved teenager and I do well in school<br>  <br>  by the way I am 17 too (and a girl lol)<br>  <br>  and the thing about a women needs a man that's the old fashion life. but it is apart of human nature for man and women to be together nothing wrong with it though. but to say a women can't survive without a man is just a complete ignorant and sexist opinion.<br>  <br>  but it always come down to the individual. how they think.feel.<br>  their morals.and conscious choices|`|gjoFXwNcaa	he sounds ignorant and sort of sexist. Ignore him, you're  not screwed up just because your mom doesn't have a dude.|`|lc51V6EAaa	tell him to shove it up his you know what :)|`|MKHd10MYaa	I think that that was his opinion on things and other people will agree with him as well. I don't know if agree or disagree with him, but that doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  The point is: It's his opinion. Respect that and make sure he respects your own opinion on those type of things. It doesn't matter if you disagree with him or not, don't call him dumb, he just threw out an opinion.<br>  <br>  You have your own opinion on stuff like that, he should respect you for that. If he doesn't, then you have the right to be mad at him. But being mad at him just because of what he believes, isn't a good enough reason to be mad at him in my opinion.|`|2FsNdcXEaa	My mom died when I was 10, my dad's been single for pretty much the past 6 years (I'm 16). I rank 3 out of 311 sophomores, making me the smartest girl in my grade by that system. My GPA is 4.4, both last semester and so far this semester. I'm in Pre Calc and AP Statistics. So you can tell him to shut is pie hole.|`|AwyL5nBuaa	well, you can't help his opinion. <br>  but usually kids who have both parents do better and have a better lifestyle.<br>  not saying that your mom isn't a good mom, it's just how some families work.|`|F32uPjAraa	Good on you luv. Stand up for yourself and your beliefs. Any person that still believes in the big vindictive sky gnome is deluded, and has no idea how the real world works.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	Meh no skin off my nose. It's his opinion. My mom was a single mom as well and she did perfectly well. Though I do admit my relationships with men suck, that's just me though.|`|GR5Fa7Shaa	He was wrong.<br>  You don't need a partner to be a success.<br>  But it helps to have one.|`|VNWnaKD9aa	sorry..but he's kinda right|`|DxbaEPbUaa	your friend is right on some issues. children who have both parents in the home have a better success rate than those who don't. they are also usually better-adjusted socially, mentally and economically. i'm not saying that single women are not doing a good job raising their children, what ia am saying is that the optimal situation is for a child to have both parents in his/her life. as far as the relationship thing goes, children learn from watching their parents. if the parents are not together or have a bad relationship, it could send the wrong message to the children. God created man and woman to be together and and raise children together in love!|`|1UJ8LiyEaa	I think that of course it can be beneficial for a child to have both parents if everyone is in the right state of mind, but also that a single parent is capable of raising a healthy, happy kid. Women definitely don't always need a man - we are plenty capable of getting along without them!|`|GKPY3t56aa	I think that children are more stable when they have both parents in their life. However, to say that kids of single parents have a hard time in relationships is BS. My mom was a single mother of three kids, and I have a wonder relationship with the person I am with. As far as GODS purpose, who knows...|`|kqk1Mqqsaa	well it's sure NICE to have two parents, and I wish I did have them both on a regular basis, but I definitely disagree with him!  he's a dummy!  you'd be perfectly fine in any sort of relationship, it doesn't matter if your parent is married or not!|`|MLc8OSQiaa	i would have to agree with everything he said except for the "woman must always need a man" part. In my experience with people who had divorced family, they always wished later on as they got older that their parents would have worked things out.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	How old is this fool?  He probably hasn't experienced life enough yet to know what he is talking about.  My mom was a single mom and I am married and graduated from College.  I plan on having kids.  I wouldn't get all upset about what he said cuz there are more important things.  But he don't know shiit.|`|lLtbH6pZaa	You both have your own opinions. Take some sociology classes at a college and you will learn the true answer to your question.|`|1rixiC3taa	Yeah, he's full of ****. I'm also  a 17 year old girl. My mom raised me all by herself and did a darn good job. I think I'm just as well rounded as someone who had two parents.|`|OnN5FQf4aa	That kid is a douchebag|`|q34vCB3Qaa	hes retarded. my parents are divorced. my mom and dad are fine and so am i|`|dMjqsxD3aa	You should know straight away he is talking absolute SH!T. dont listen to that dick|`|Uq6V3S4laa	That guy is a jerk !|`|Tmusgqbmaa	who cares about him just ignore him|`|b3iuhwuPaa	ignore him|`|axylPYftaa	tell him to stfu, cuz you cant change it|`|af533b17ca68713705564cacfb86ba98aa	What a bastard, honestly. <br>  You tell him girl.|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	Well, I was a single mom of 2 boys age 2 and 4 years old. Their father was made to leave by the state. He was extremely abusive to them. I raised them all alone from that point on. My older son is 30 and my younger son is 28, both are doing very well with their wives and have good incomes coming in. I have had many people say that I did a great job on raising them alone. I used to take it with a grain of salt, but now I pat myself on the back. To me it's how a child is raised. I raised mine with lots of love and some punishments too. So, I say your friend is wrong, and you will have a great relationship with the right kind of guy.|`|W44v1iykaa	I think that is very dumb. What if there was physical or severe abuse involved or infidelity? I am a strong believer that women can do whatever they choose and can do it well if they try hard enough. Of course they can raise children who are extremely well off in life.<br>  <br>  Men do not complete women. I have friends who's parents are divorced and they are doing absolutely fine with dating and life.|`|GnOBuiaRaa	It 100% depends on the environment and person as an individual. Personally, I grew up with my mom and am scared as hell of women. I am terrible with relationships. Granted I am only 19. I know kids just like me who are completely fine.<br>  <br>  But for me personally it all depended on my family before the breakup and just my familys chemistry. I would say it all depends...|`|fTIFiK3oaa	Well, let me tell you like this. In this life, you are going to encounter people that call you things and tell you things that get up under your skin. However, you must learn to let stuff go. Always remember this: "It doesn't matter what people call you, it's what you answer to. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you a little.|`|BltBopVgaa	His opinion is his opinion.I personally think it is completely inaccurate and completely assumption based.NONE of that is true.He is just a snotty,judge mental,and very close minded.Don't listen to him because he is just very reluctant to be open minded and realize that he is wrong!|`|9YCmiewRaa	He sounds intolerably smug, and i bet he LOVED having a 17 year old to preach to. The idea of a woman doing fine on her own probably scares him and offends his puffed up little ego. Ignore and avoid.|`|XaIcNmbxaa	I SAY DONT LET IT BOTHER YOU...THIS IS WHAT HE BELIEVES. BELIEFS ARE FINE BUT WHATS BETTER IS KNOWING...AND YOU WILL NEVER KNOW ANYTHING UNTIL YOU PERSONALY HAVE DONE IT OR EXPERIENCED IT...I THINK YOU HAVE A KNOWING THAT HIS BELIEF IS WRONG BECAUSE YOUR MOM IS EVIDENCE TO YOU..SO LET HIM HAVE HIS OPINIONS AND BELIEVES AND YOU CAN HAVE YOURS, BUT WHAT IS RIGHT IS WHAT YOU KNOW, NOT BELIEVE|`|XX8dmWG8aa	honestly you might think your mom is fine and yea she probably is doing fine<br>  she wont show it but she's probably stressed out more then you think because raising kids on your own is stressful <br>  so yea i kinda agree with him|`|WocxeHqEaa	He sounds like a stuck-up-southern-christian-douche.|`|hKpXwrbmaa	my best friend always says this too, and it drives me insane!<br>  <br>  understand that, statistically, children who are raised with both a mother and a father in the home are generally more successful than those from a "broken" (i hate this term) home. however, that doesn't mean that there aren't thousands of people who are doing well by society's standards and were raised by a single parent. and, how do you account for the countless rapists, molesters, and murderers raised by two parents? <br>  <br>  no one can say who will or will not be a good parent; or who can or cannot raise good children. it is a subjective issue, not one that i think can generalized by statistics.
9oiZ6Rmbaa	Make a choice, pick your best shot at being happy.
8gyaS3mGaa	tell her to knock it off, and stop being a brat. even if you are not friends tell her you will report her to a authoritative figure (teacher most likely) and she better knock it off. She most likely won't listen, so ignore it, maybe showing u r hurt makes her feel happy and satisfied. So just ignore it if a confrontation is unsuccessful.|`|LYDVekF1aa	You can't fight fire with fire. I think that if you stop saying things that she will stop too.

VzzQP2PJaa	No your not wrong to feel mad, and you should really have a serious talk with him and tell him how this making you feel. Since you already attempted this, you should give him an ultimatum. If your not gonna start showing more attention and respect for me, then I don't think you should be with me. See then what he does, and you can pretty much tell from there. Your way too young to have one guy not appreciate you, you don't want to spend the rest of your life in relationships like that. Hope this helped, good luck hun. Remember you deserve only the best.|`|AA11108018	Some guys are thought less and they don't understand that girl want hear from more than just weekends|`|4v2ZTZvAaa	its not wrong of u to feel that way, its wrong of him to do those kinna things to u!!. . . i think u deserve better|`|PPCca4htaa	You have every right to be upset. I am the same way when my BF does that to me. With the phone calls though? I wouldn't be to stressed about that. All guys do that. But with the movies? I'd be pissed. Really pissed. The attention? IDK what to say about that. My advice to you is to try talking to him about it when you have time. Ask him if some thing's wrong and if he's mad @ you or something. That's what I do with my BF, Alex. Nothing is wrong about being upset and frustrated about it. I'm the same way. :)|`|CVWizvy6aa	Honey, don't ever verbally ask for attention. It makes you seem desperate. When you approach a situation that way, the result will become the opposite. While he's having fun with his friends, you have fun with yours. When he's going to the movies with his friends, do soemthing fun with your friends.  Don't make it seems like you can't survive without him. He will come running back and overflow you with attention.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	he's being a dick.  Everyone likes talking to there bf or gf (if they really like them that is)  no matter how the communication is being done.  I think you're getting played hun, this is a lousy excuse he is making about this phone thing.  You need to have a serious talk with him and if he doesn't take you serious; doesn't change, you have to kick him to the curb, don't let someone treat you like that!|`|65960a4770fc3571b7f8bfa49f7590feaa	about the phone i give him reason. theres nothing that pisses ME off more than . the call of: hi , whats up, nooothing just what you doing.<br>  giiirls!!! dont do that, that gets on all guys nerves you are just wanting to know what were doing. on the going to the movies with friend there is no reason why he cant take you to the movies with hes friends. i would move on if i was you. im sure he wants to break up but he dosent have the *&%$* to tell you|`|PwkYJoVgaa	no, not a good boyfriend at all. if you want to keep him i'd suggest you talk to him.|`|4ZC14zPTaa	It's just puberty|`|UFrcaQQZaa	dump him totally|`|AA12265794	Hmmm...

If he says that he's "maturing" then he should be able to see this from your point of view too.  Just because he's an *** to you doesn't mean that he's mature.

Once he is ready to be mature, you'll be happy.|`|914lxjtJaa	if it really upsets you tell him about it and if he doesn't care then perhaps he isnt the one for you. Only you can decide what is and is not acceptable in a personal relationship. However, with that being said, if I were treating a girl like that it would probably be because I didn't really like her that much and was trying to get her to lose interest without hurting her feelings.|`|wFBaJUwIaa	You aren't wrong at all. My girlfriend used to do that to me and I broke up with her because, quite frankly, she didn't care about me. If he's not listening to you MAKE HIM LISTEN. Break it off for awhile or stay away from him and let him miss you. It'll blow his mind if he can't get what he wants.|`|DHO5baDuaa	NOT AT ALL!!!im a boy i have a gf......i love givin her attention.but if your bf wont even take some time out of his day to talk to you........thats not right....you should tell him that you want attention.........maybe he'll give you some.........well,GOOD LUCK!!! ;)|`|TyQciyGKaa	yes, he's being a horrible boyfriend. no it isn't wrong for you to feel the way you do. it's natural. if it continues after talking to him about it, let him go. it'll be what's best for you.|`|YZowEwCoaa	It sounds like he should give you a little more attention, but don't overreact.

I really think you deserve better than that, and if you need someone to talk to more, just e-mail me(:|`|1rToYkeZaa	its normal. don't worry. he might play hard to get just because he wants YOU to tell him you want to be with him more often. maybe thats a sign for you to tell him that. if not, he just wants to enjoy his puberty i guess. whenever he goes out, you could do the same also.|`|7QC7Gpgvaa	if u're sad/mad break up with him! u can't get mad because of a guy ??|`|oAIdNhu7aa	omfg! the guy is suck an as*hole!dump him i say!!! >.<|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	hes being selfish..it doesnt seem like he wants to be with you anymore....you should talk to him about how you feel...and its not wrong to feel mad or sad! good luck|`|fMEypXDYaa	Your plan b, he is busy with his plan a, dump him and find one closer to your age group.

f2fyXyulaa	To start with you need to tell your "friends" that you go out with your boyfriend because YOU like him. He's your boyfriends not theirs so they need back off some. <br>  <br>     Second, you need to tell someone of authority about the girl that is punching you. She has no right to do that to you. <br>  <br>     If your friends keep acting the way that they are towards you, they are really not your friends. You need to tell them how you feel about all of it. If they don't try to change then they are not worth your time.<br>  <br>    Good luck!

"|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	The foreskin is an integral part of the penis; measuring 15 square inches in an adult, over half the penile skin, including the most sensitive parts of the penis. The foreskin is packed with nerve endings, special anatomical features like the ridged band and has a unique elastic gliding action, allowing it to slide on itself and act like lube. This action is what most males use to masturbate with. Circumcised males use what skin they have left, except those who are cut so tightly that they have to use lube or just rub it dry. The intact male can stroke the entire length of his penis using his foreskin and also has the option to use lube too, if he wants to. During intercourse the foreskin acts like lube on entry and may act as a dam, preventing lubricating secretions escaping from the vagina. In one study women reported that sex with an intact partner was gentler and more satisfying since he doesn't have to thrust as hard to feel enough stimulation. Removing the foreskin turns the surface of the glans from an inner mucosal membrane to outside skin. Newly circumcised adults usually go through some weeks of intense discomfort as the glans is constantly exposed to rubbing on clothing, until it develops a thicker keratin layer and becomes less sensitive.<br>  In infancy the foreskin has a protective function, preventing meatal (ie. pee hole) ulceration. The penis forms as one organ and at birth the foreskin is usually fused to the glans like a fingernail to its finger. So there is no cavity for germs and dirt to collect in until it separates naturally later, at an average age of 10. So a newborn intact penis is much easier to look after than a circumcised one, which has a raw wound exposed to faeces and urine in the diaper. Only the boy himself should retract it and then he can be taught to skin back and rinse with plain water regularly. <br>  Not one major medical organisation in the world recommends routine infant circumcision anymore. The US is the last western nation still doing this to about 50% of its newborn males. In Australia and Canada doctors now mostly refuse to do it.<br>  I agree the law should be changed and this mutilation stopped.<br>  I resent my own genital mutilation deeply,<br>  Geoff|`|UlXZdcW7aa	Ya hangs around alot|`|OauZKhKVaa	I think it should be a man's choice whether or not he wants to be circumcised. I will never do that to my children.

b70cNqyqaa	Sweetheart, you need help. You need a consultation with a divorce lawyer. They usually give the first meeting free. They will tell you what they think, and what you can do. They will help you to decide what you need to do next. <br>  <br>  This is a very bad time to be homeless with a 12 yo son, but if he is beating you, there are Battered Women shelters, and those people can help you to find the social services to find you a place to live. Its a very bad time for that, since hundreds of thousands of people have lost their homes, and the homeless shelters have waiting lists, depending on where you live. <br>  <br>  Also, It depends on where you live , what he can take from you. <br>  This is what a lawyer is supposed to do, protect you, protect you from the bad guys who want to leave you on the street. <br>  <br>  Many women and children are left homeless, from divorce. Many couples want a divorce, but live with each other in agreement so they can have a home for the child.<br>  I pray for you.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	It's the price we pay for the choices we make. These decisions always  have devastating repercussions to them. Sounds like if you are leaving, best to do it quietly. I sense he has a temper and with a blow such as this your safety and your sons must come first. In the end the courts will divide everything that was accumulated within the marriage, equally, as well child and spousal financial support. Better he took the house and not your son.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	This depends on the laws of the state you are in.  But the house is probably not up for grabs--a shame that you let this occur.  Check the deed to make sure.  Just because the stepfather's name is on the loan doesn't mean it's on the deed and if the understanding was that this home was the marital home, this transaction can be scrutinized by the court--might have to seek Equity court for this.<br>  <br>  If the truck is in your name, you have a right to it, but you will have to be able to make the payments--contact the lender and see what's up with this, how much is owed, etc.<br>  <br>  Unless your son is disabled, I assume he is in school full-time.  This gives opportunity for you to find a job--do so immediately, if possible.  You might be able to get alimony pending litigation and also permanent alimony.<br>  <br>  You cannot afford to not have an attorney, so borrow the money from your family if you have to.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	If his stepfather's name is on the deed to the house, then it's his stepfather's house and you have no claim on it.  If he he doesn't pay for the truck and it gets repossessed, then you lose the truck and it goes on both of your credit historys.  So yes, he can, and no there's no law saying he can't.  If you get a divorce and you are granted the truck, then you will have to make the truck payment.  If you can't, then you lose it.  You have no claim on the house, it's not in your name or your husband's name.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	If your husband's stepfather owns the house then the house is still your husband's stepfather's. You need to find an attorney and ask them  things that you are wanting to know. I am also divorced and I was given my home and my ex's and my name were on the deed to the house. If my name was not on the deed then it would have been sold. Your husband can't take everything from you in a divorce. My divorce papers were stated that our things were supposed to be divided up between the two of us.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Unless one had proof of cheating then they split it 50/50. However, that would be everything that is in your and his name. The judge wont kick you out homeless. Also the home isn't in his name. He would have to come up with the money to buy the home from your stepfather. At least that is how it goes in my state. Also your more likely to get the home since its in your step fathers name and you have a child.|`|fMEypXDYaa	First we have to know what state you live in, then maybe we can give you a answer, if his step father owns the house, then most likely your gonna have to move out once the divorce is final.<br>  In most states, anything you both bought as man and wife will have to be split 50-50 between the two of you.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Wont happen. Chances are youll be awarded custody of your son along with child support and since you have no means of support youll probably get spousal support too. Now since you have your son and the Judge will not put children out on the street, he will let you stay where you are until you can find a suitable replacement place to live since his stepfather owns the house. now if you guys owned the house youd stay put for a few years. Now if you argue that you have no way of getting around the Judge may order custody of the truck to you while he makes payments but that will be only temporary if at all but theres always a chance in todays court. So he can say all he wants but the Judge has the final say so.  Good luck|`|AA12159712	If the house is in the stepfather's name, it's up to the stepfather to decide who lives there and who doesn't.  As far as the law is concerned, unless there is a written contract on which you can claim some type of ownership thru attempting to purchase the house by payments you have been making, then you are considered just renters, not having a stake in the actual mortgage. He can allow the truck to get repossessed if it is only in his name on the title. Otherwise, it is considered community property and the court has to decide what to do.|`|djUMvICoaa	So he would go into court and show that he let the house go back to his family?  The judge might not like that too much.  And he's going to let his truck go too?  How's he going to get to work?  He's very vindictive, to say the least and shows one more reason I can understand you getting out.  But I would do it anyway, you have nothing to lose.  there is no love there at least on his part, and he wants ot keep you down at all costs.  You would at least be looking at child support and he wouldn't be able to hide that.  good luck  At the very least he is being verbally abusive, something that most shelters open their doors to.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	Well, if his step-father owns the house, your husband can't take that away from you - but his step-father can.<br>  <br>  If the truck was purchased during your marriage, it should be considered community property. Is the child his? If so, he is required by law to support his child.<br>  <br>  If I were you - I'd get a job immediately and get ready to take care of yourself and your son.|`|H6Lc79EOaa	My friends are going through a divorce.

He's just trying to keep from letting you find out that he likes you because he doesn't know if your feelings have changed for him or not.|`|8U0Wtop2aa	If a guy would have said that to my brother, he would have gotten his a** kicked by my brother.  Maybe he is afraid to tell your brother that he likes you, i have 4 brothers and they are all very protective.|`|jzoAP3H3aa	Cuz ur brother is gonna fly kick his a** if he tells him|`|4qwIPhfOaa	i actually had a guy problem like that too! he told his friends he liked my but said i hate u and wish u would die! that summer he told me he loved me! he does like u! when guy say i hate u to a girl it translates in guy language to ur weird but that's what i like about u! so maybe ask him to meet up with u at the mall or a movie so that he can see ur fun great personality

WSQSbZPsaa	I like to pray to God when I feel lonely.  I'll pray that He comforts you and helps to take away the kind of empty feeling you're going through.  I suggest that you do the same.  Not sure what your beliefs are, but if you do decide to take my advice and pray, remember not to make it a routine prayer.  God's really there listening to you and wants to be your friend, so treat Him like a friend.  He'll help you out.  Maybe not immediately, but He will get to making you feel better.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps ^_^|`|ns1F0p8Laa	Well I can give you advice...

I think what you did(if you are looking for a reason to this madness) is embarrass him...I think maybe he felt like you were saying he was some kinda freak or something...either way you meant no ill will and you should just let him know that you didn't mean to (don't say embarrass him) come off sounding rude.And you are sorry,just try to at the same time let him know you just need a little privacy sometimes and ask him to please not take it personally..good luck hun!|`|RB1HEmByaa	damn that is gay, i guess just live with it|`|AA11199456	wow, all that just because you said he was awkward? people usually feel insulted if that's what they're insecure about so maybe he's hurt that you realize he's awkward. i also don't see why you need to ask for electricity and water. try talking to him in a rational way or tell him that you just wanted to keep girl stuff private.

In my experience, which I'm not sure  was true or not, love can be like that. But, it's not like that all the time. There are ups and downs. The ups are absolutely wonderful, like Edward and Bella. And the downs are really horrible, because the person you love the most can upset you the most.|`|ZNeO9uCXaa	Well i would say it's not true because no one can just randomly fall inlove with a vampire.<br>  i mean . like i berlay started too read twilight . i'm almost done with the 1st bookk.<br>  But i would mostly say depending on the peoples life.<br>  i dunn' think it would be easy as 1,2,3, just like bella .<br>  i think it take's time.|`|XGjnR9EUaa	yes all the time and, if the relationship that i'm in is what i want to beleive it is. be careful once it seems to have come along because its easy to be blinded by something that seems to be becuase, of the want and desire.

Eo8I3fbnaa	He's a guy. He can't read your mind. Just tell him you need him to acknowledge you. But does it really matter who says hi 1st as long as he's your friend. He just might be intimidated by you and doesn't want to make you mad.
rARXLfV3aa	if he flirts with you and looks at you alot, then more than likely he likes you.<br>  i dont know for sure obviously, but if he says stuff like "you're a good person" then i think he does!<br>  maybe you could have your friend ask him about all three of you could hang out or something, and you will know if he likes you or not because you said they are like best friends!<br>  hope this helps!|`|DfKJBvCaaa	I would just tell him the truth.

I understand that you would just want to be friends if that was all you could get. And you can still be friends after you tell him how you feel. Just say 'OK I'll get over it. it's just a crush.' And trust me you can get over it. It's happened to me.|`|MKHd10MYaa	Without being obvious, hmm. That would mean that you don't want to straight out ask him if he likes you, I'm assuming.<br>  <br>  Well, my answer for you would be time. Be patient, continue to talk to him, slowly work your way up to become a closer and closer friend to him. Talk to him more in school, then slowly through the internet. Work your way up and when you're really close to him, slowly start flirting. See if he flirts back and look for his reaction. Giggle at his jokes or gently push him when he says something stupid to you or something -- those are some easy flirting techniques that aren't too obvious. Pretty soon, you should somehow see the answer.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Why don't ask him to eat lunch with you; or with you and your friends,  There you could talk him, see if he wanted to hang out.

WyLm1HmZaa	I've always been shy with boys.  Not boys that are my friends, but boys that I like.<br>  All I can say is go with the flow for now.  Watch him, see if you get signals that he might be interested in you.  Flirt with him, but not a lot.  Smile at him in the hall, ask him about the homework in a class you might have together or something.<br>  Start off slow.  If you guys are meant to be together, god will find a way. :)|`|h0uAjCLzaa	I had the same problem just a few days ago. I tried to be his friend. It worked and I think that he likes me back.

FlSLNhsoaa	dont do anything, maybe try it, if you want to be best friends with him try it out maybe you'll like it. the last thing you should do is tell his family and girlfriend|`|LCIcUTwNaa	How about speaking to him first.Sitting him down and having a discussion might help.|`|fyyfPEemaa	You have to straighten him out! Talk to him and make him see some sense, he has to realize what he is doing is wrong. If he just started there is still hope! <br>  Talk to an adult or professional that you can trust, and seek information on how you can help him-- find out the reasons for why he's even smoking weed. <br>  <br>  It won't be an easy or fast process but if you help him and have patience. he'll appreciate it more than you'll ever know.|`|OwfoyXpraa	Talk to him about it first.<br>  Make it clear to him that you don't like this at all and that you're worried that something is going to happen to him down the road if he continues on like this.<br>  Judge his reaction to this, and then if you think you should, then tell him that if he won't tell his family and girlfriend, then YOU will.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun, I hope it all works out.|`|b179bfff358a93e0bb048cde58264d8eaa	You should tell someone. It's the best thing you can do for him.<br>  It shouldn't matter if he is going to hate you or not because if you help him, you'll always know you have done the right thing instead of regretting not helping your friend.|`|NUBeg2paaa	I would talk with him. Telling his parents and his girlfriend isn't going to work. He'll feel like he will never be able to trust you ever again and will become reluctant to change. Tell him you don't want to watch him go on a bad road and ask him to just think about what you are saying.|`|1HLPznZhaa	This is a tough one. I do have a hard time believing his family and girlfriend don't know he smokes if he " smokes habitually " . I suggest you discuss this with your mom and dad or another adult..good luck|`|OgcdoEDvaa	How old are you guys? When you are over 18 it is best to go directly to your friend and discuss your concerns about his drug use and even offer to go to an AA meeting with him before you discuss this with his parents. That is the most respectful approach. But when you are minors, I suggest you first approach him, but then also share your concern with another adult, like a counselor, not necessarily the parents because that can cause trust issues in your relationship with him, but to answer your question, NO he won't hate you because that is an ego emotion, his heart will feel what it feels, including disappointment or gratitude for your help. No one knows how others will react when we intervene, and that is why I suggest a softer approach first with him alone. Getting someone in "trouble" with their parents can sometimes have the opposite effect and make someone rebel and turn further to drugs... so please come from a place of love for him rather then fear of his death. And when doing so remember to treat others how you want to be treated.|`|ifAVv3Apaa	You should really talk to him. maybe threaten him saying your going to tell or you wont be friends with him anymore. tell him your really concerned and your just trying to look out for him. if hes a good enough friend hell listen to you. if that doesnt work maybe tell someone else like your own parent and then they can talk to his parents. Good luck. i Hope he stops.|`|kmhfLzEFaa	one of my friends has the same problem =/<br>  i think you should if your a real friend who cares you wouldnt want your friend smoking and getn sick or going to jail ya know <br>  but on the other hand he probably trusts you keeping this a secret its up to you dude|`|3099b987d3a742398f764f6ed2489a31aa	so go ahead tell them what u know by sending letter and picture or any other prove his bad behavior to his parents and girlfriend.  furthermore, don't put something name that is you send this letter and don't write in hand ok.|`|6kkXEpMKaa	He'll hate you at first,but if he recovered,he'll realize you was do it for his own benefit,trytalk tlk to him first|`|FLZaCrF9aa	that is a tough one what i would do is talk him out of it and if that doesn't work tell his parents|`|OnN5FQf4aa	weed could kill him so...|`|c3V8Io9faa	Wow i don' know.|`|TCZz2OKvaa	Well, I don't know if it's possible to OD on weed; but it is possible to die an inch at a time.  Now, I understand that he didn't necessarily harm you.  But the Bible says if someone harms you you should go to them one-on-one first.  Why embarrass them with other people when you might be able to take care of it one-on-one?  it just takes guts:<br>  <br>  “If a [brother] sins against you, go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone. If the member listens to you, you have regained that one. But if you are not listened to, take one or two others along with you, so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If the member refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church, let such a one be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector." (Matthew 18:15-17, NRSV)<br>  <br>  So you involve as few people as possible at first, in order to spare his feelings and not make it a matter for gossip.  Then you involve a couple more, and so forth.  If he doesn't listen, maybe he likes weed more than his friends.|`|9i94KNfOaa	This is how I feel,<br>  <br>  well... if you care then you should tell him how you feel let him know that you are concerned and you want to help b4 its to late. Sweetie if this doesn't help then hun he wasn't a good friend after all and wasn't really there for you as a friend a true friend would listen to what you have to say and accept the fact you care. I hope this helps if you need me email, i have MSN, yahoo messenger, and myspace i am available almost all the time.|`|b5662e172aa16ccf072b0cf5e6c4f661aa	In my opinion you should advise your friend of the consequences of his act.  It is up to him to take it or leave it.  I do not agree you should tell no one about his conduct.  You own him loyalty, anyway, let him know that whatever he decides, you will always be his friend and will hope the best for him.  Your friend is doing what he wants to do - good or bad.  No one will change that, except himself.  Once again, give him your unconditional advise and pray for the best.|`|rEUI5sVvaa	Honestly, it's really not your business or your place to step in. I mean I don't want to sound like a hag but that's my opinion. I understand your worried about your friend and you are his best friend but let him tell them. If he wanted them to know he would tell them. Smoking weed really isn't a big deal, you would be surprised at who and how many people do it. Your teacher, your brother, your uncle could be a dealer and you'd never know. I understand your against it but as I said, let him choose who he trusts to tell something like that to. I hope this helps. =)|`|VD694WY1aa	It sounds like you are against the weed smoking, so you if you want to stay true to yourself, confront your friend and tell him you plan to tell his family or his girlfriend unless he tells them first.

If you get stumped, ask her for help w/ school work, and show her any test you really do well with.|`|6cCWUf9xaa	Here is the fact: In your core subjects your GPA is a dismissal 1.0 (a D average). Your mom is correct in punishing you for bad grades and take the stuff out of your room, but I would go further and not even let you on the computer at all, not even for school work. As far as the rest of the stuff she has you do that is not right. You need time to do your homework and improve your grades. As far as not seeing your friends that is wrong also. You need a life as you are a teenager. I see it this way She can look at your homework and if it is done correctly then let you out but insist that you be home at a certain time and if you are not home at a certain time then punish you at least a week from seeing your friends. If you can print this out fine if not show your mom this and hopefully this will have your mom ease up on you.<br>  <br>  Thomas|`|S2rvxT4daa	My 12 year old has come home again with another D in central class. She has been grounded.<br>  <br>  I think perhaps you've been overinvolved with your friends and girlfriend. You'll need to ask your Mom if you can sit down and talk and find out if you can negotiate seeing your friends -- but if she sees them as part of the problem of you not taking your school work seriously, then it might not happen the way you hope.<br>  <br>  Here's a practical suggestion: write a letter (or essay) that's reasonable and insightful, about why you slipped with your grades, and how you hope to regain her trust in you and your responsibilities.<br>  <br>  How long have you been grounded, anyhow? A week? Two weeks? A month? A semester? Does your school have after school tutoring by the teachers? (the middle school my daughter goes to does) Can you talk to the school counselor and ask her to mediate between you and your mother if nothing seems to work, and you've been legitimately working hard?
OwfoyXpraa	I see the problem here..<br>  you're WAY too nice of a friend. (:<br>  And she'll use that against you. (Had that happen to me once.. ugh.)<br>  <br>  Do you like this boy a lot? Do you want to stay with him?<br>  If you answered yes, then stay with him.<br>  She's honestly probably just jealous because he asked her out first and she turned him down, and now he's going out with you. It's just a crush. She'll find a new boy.<br>  <br>  But if you don't really like this guy a lot, then be my quest, dump him if you so wish to.<br>  <br>  Personally I would tell Bryan this. I'd say, "Y'know, (friend's name) is kind of upset that I'm going out with you, because you asked her out first and she said no. Now she's having second thoughts now that I'm with you, and it feels like she's trying so hard to get more time with you. I just thought I'd tell you this because I don't want her to split us up."<br>  <br>  ..OR, you could say "Bryan, (friend's name) is interested in a second chance with you. I won't pressure you in anyway. It's your choice. You can stay with me, or you can go back to her if that's what you want."<br>  <br>  Idk, but good luck hun.|`|HiJ2xPeWaa	I think you should leave him...chances are she'll tire of him soon enough.<br>  <br>  Obviously, the real reason she wants to be with him is because u're wit him...<br>  <br>  Just try not to be alone in the same room with them...awkward!!

UjhWIrJ1aa	Wow, you sound like a very nice woman. Easiest way to get him to realize all the work you do, is to stop doing it. It might be filthy for 2 or 3 days, but he'll catch on.

Think how difficult your life<br>  would be if children were involved.<br>  <br>  If you can't have 2 way communications, you won't have much of a future and you will always be on the losing side.|`|sVfLVaFTaa	Stop doing everything.  Clean up after yourself and only yourself.  Cooking dinner is fine but he can add his own condiments.<br>  <br>  My fiance was like that for a while until 1 day i just said enough.  After about a week of me only picking up my stuff he started seeing how dirty the house looked.  We sat down and talked and I explained to him that it was all him and it made him feel bad but he got over it quick and now helps out constantly!<br>  <br>  I'd give it a try at least.  It may work for you too!|`|AA11496842	He's lazy and he will never change.
tU5NJVL3aa	And you are still married to this loser because... why?  If you insist on staying, you need to set a time table, no compromises -- he has a job in the next month or you are out of there. PERIOD.  The begging for sex I don't know what to tell you -- sounds like an adict to me, and/or it has to do with the fact that he's got nothing but time on his hands to think about it, since his life is just so cushy, being taken care of by you and your friends and all...|`|GWRP3vLQaa	You have a good case for just leaving. He has to realize that sex (no matter how good it is or isn't) is not enough of a contribution to this relationship, and is no longer even wanted.<br>  <br>  You cannot force him to get up off his lazy butt and find a job, and in these times, he may not be ABLE to find a job if he has been unemployed for a whole year. As a former personnel interviewer, a large gap in employment like that does not bode well for a grown man. At any rate, you shouldn't have to find a job for him.<br>  <br>  The only contol he has is that which is exerting over you, because he has no control over any other aspect of his life. He is the only one who can change this. <br>  <br>  Divorcing him won't release you from joint obligations, and there is the child to consider. What will become of him if you bail?<br>  <br>  It is a very, very tough situation, and I really do feel for you, but you cannot continue to do everything in this relationship and you must make that clear to him. Otherwise you will just have to cut your losses and work you own way out of your half of the debts. At least you won't have the pressure of taking care of him and the child and yourself, and you won't have to put up with constant sexual ambushes. Good luck.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Please don't get pregnant! Holy, I'm sorry sweetie, you deserve a man in your life. Really, he's just not up to being anything more than a 'stud', and that you can find that anywhere. He has three kids from an ex and he's behind in support, and sits like a dog waiting for you to feed him. He was probably like this with his ex and she dumped his A@@ and I bet you are making all the mistakes she did by keeping him.<br>  <br>  We all know he needs to grow up, but you have made him too comfortable, and he is using you beyond belief! If you were my sister I'd have words with him and I guarantee he wouldn't like it. He would like it even less when he got kicked to the curb again.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is, after a year of not even trying to find a job, pressuring you for sex, moaning like a little boy, he needs to have a wake up call. Kick him out. Do it because you love him, so he will stand up and become a man.|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	Well It sounds like you all need to sit down and have an heart to heart. Let him know exactly how you feel and what you need in the relationship. I understand how you feel, he is a man. Now he needs to act like one. You are a very good woman and he knows what he got. He is trying to keep you by having sex with you all the time. Maybe he don't want to pay out all that child support. Baby talk to him and tell him you can do bad by yourself. That is real! He has to shi_  or get off of the pot.|`|cRz31MlMaa	wow that was long but I read it all. He sounds like he wants a mother not a wife. Maybe this is why his other relationships failed. He has no sense of responsibility no self worth and really doesn't care as long as he gets his food and sex and you are there at his beck and call. You need to make him step up really lay it on tough give him an ultimatum either you get a job and start to contribute to this family in ! month or your on your own really you would be better off without him he is just holding you back. If it were me I would have taken the walk long ago but if you love him and wish for your marriage to work you need to MAKE him make a choice .|`|chZFmJOPaa	Oh lord... hahaha. It sounds like he has more of a problem than just wanting affection. Hes jobless and not making an effort to get a job?<br>  <br>  Consider separation for a bit...... kick his butt out or you leave. I wouldnt tolerate that... if anything, him grabbing at you like that, would make me feel like a toy...not a wife.|`|nBjQQ3yraa	Dump his lazy *** and get some counceling for yourself so you are not tempted to marry someone else just like him.|`|5d95ebb15bb0cd41de0cb8b36d7eb955aa	Tell him you only have sex with grown men who have jobs and pay their bills.|`|C4rVwbi7aa	i would have him read this he needs to step it up WOW!!!|`|5HoZ3NHeaa	Well of course he looking for sex. He was in jail and played the female part. As for working most employers do not want to hire felons.|`|7RbootLlaa	I'll be honest, I only got 1/3 down your reply and I glanced the rest of it all the way down. Why are you with him for? If he annoys you for sex and you keep telling him to lay off and then he puts on the sob sob BS story. Don't believe him. Crying is a cop out, women will buckle when the guy does that and he knows you do too, that's why he does it.<br>  <br>  Marriage - how long did you both know each other before the marriage? Did he propose within say 3 months of meeting you? He probably just married you for sex only. Guys do, do that. Stop giving him sex every time he wants it and don't believe him when he starts to cry. Even tell him, "only girls do that". You will see his true colors when he realizes you are in charge and that you don't believe him when he cries. You may find he will turn violent towards you.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself then, why bother with him?|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Small defense for him, the economy is tough out there. 8.1% unemployed and more losing their jobs every day.  Sounds like he has given up on looking for work.  Now for sex he has a lot of time on his hands and feels that the only way he can express himself is through sex.  That doesn't necessary mean that is right.|`|b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	maybe he looks at sex as a 'stress reliever' while you look at it as a secondary act because of the financial situation you guys are in.  i agree though. i dont think i could have sex all the time if other things had to be settled.  what if you sit him down and tell him that you honestly can't relax enough to enjoy sex without the security of finances being in order.  that's how you are.  tell him that if he gets a job it would make you so much more at ease and willing to have great sex.  promise him mind-blowing sex if he gets a job already!!|`|g6n3OnmSaa	Is the only reason you are still with him because you know that his son is way better off with you in the picture than he would be if you kicked his father out on his ear?|`|aNYA9KjHaa	wow you seem very unhappy!<br>  you have more serious problems than having too much sex!!!|`|BHGWdN8maa	tell him once he has a job you will have sex with him i do feel for you he sounds like a hassel..i would dump him|`|dlGZebDmaa	My question is...with due respect:<br>  Why the F*** did you marry him???|`|5df004c13545e833eab59ba6fdcb1e18aa	You are supporting a worthless lazy slacker of a man no not a man he is a child.Cut his sorry *** off till he brings home a paycheck.Otherwise why would he change if you keep changing his diapers for him.|`|81b0c2959d4a4f6317cc2e7064ca1b71aa	That sounds like my ex, minus the sex, the children, and the other things. my ex wont get a job, even when i find jobs available or give him the applications. They'd sit there and not be filled out. Tell him to straighten up his act or your going to dump his ***. And when he doesn't, leave him.|`|XlOZRYWwaa	Ok, i really couldnt read all of that but i think I got the jist of it. Thats a tough situation, guys seem to just be hard wired that way. Get a your husband to not want sex as much...... if you find an answer you could write a book and be rich! LOL! Good luck. I certainly would like to know the answer to this one|`|Yd1la6mLaa	Finances - that is not your job. It's the husband's job to provide. But it looks like the only thing he can provide you is sex. Sex will not keep you alive! If I were you, I'd leave his good-for-nothing @$$. Because! I can handle and take care of things on my own! Who needs a man like that?!|`|c9wgJprEaa	This might sound awful, but it sounds like the two of you might need a break, just so you can try not losing your mind, from the sounds of it. Or, if sitting down and talking to him hasn't worked, counseling maybe. I mean, you can only take so much.|`|jzq5jXp7aa	i think you should leave him.<br>  you're too good for him.<br>  he's just using you for sex.<br>  <br>  try minimizing this cause its so damn long!|`|nkiwlf7Paa	Sounds like he's searching for sympathy.  Tell him simply that you're not having sex with him until he gets work, and stick to it.  If that's too drastic of a measure - stop holding his hand - tell him you need his help because you just can't do it anymore - you know the damsel in disteress ;) - when he starts apologizing for putting you through it - apologize for making him worry - or you could just sit him down, cut through all the crap - and make a point, this relationship canot continue like this - if it's not going to change, you may be better off finding a good divorce lawyer...|`|r7u2g8roaa	You have set yourself up to lose. I hope this is not a habit in your life.<br>  <br>  1) If a Deserving man needs sex you either give it to him or he will find someone who will (same with a woman).<br>  <br>  2) You should have married a better man but when you married him you also accepted responsibility to his son who is now your son as well. The child comes first!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  3) Give him a firm time limit to find a job. Leave him if necessary but maintain love and financial support for your child.<br>  <br>  4) Make better choices in the future.|`|wKeFboxHaa	I've been married for a long time and I can tell you that most problems in a marriage don't have anything to do with sex.It's just that the man never recognizes the problems until the sex  life suffers. Money problems kill a woman's libido.Let me say that again. Money problems kill a woman's libido! Especially when she feels like her partner isn't supporting her.Men seem to have the attitude that just because they married you then you owe them sex whenever they want it,regardless of the way they treat you. <br>  <br>  My best advice to you would be to just sit him down and explain to him that his clingy, controlling behavior and his not contributing to the household financially are making you lose respect for him as a man. If things don't change you may have to just leave him. You would certainly be better off financially if you weren't having to pay his way.
uyxbZTQIaa	A child should not run after a parent.  If your father really loves you, he will do the effort to be with you and spend time with you.  Don't give him the chance to hurt you more than he already has.|`|PBp3JAS2aa	If he left you and he acts like that then you should stop talking to him. He didn't do anything for you. He took things away from you. If your step mother is talking really cold tell her in a polite way that its rude to do such a thing...but really you should stop calling him..ect. Because after a while he will realize what he's missing out on and what he actually does love but the way eh treats you now he doesn't deserve it.|`|3tXg9NSbaa	i know how that feels my father doesnt care about me at all i live with my cousins and he comes over to pick them up sometimes and he doesnt even say hi or look at me i talk to my grandma which is his mom and he can be sitting right there and not talk to me at all i tryed everything and he doesnt respond but for you i think u should come clean and talk to him and u should try and make a relationship with him it might be hard for you at first but hopefully it'll get easier|`|e4eB4gK1aa	That's really sad, and its to bad you have to go through that.  But that is a pretty tough call you'll have to make.  Remember one thing - you have to live your life for you and sometimes its just easier and healthier being around people who make you feel wanted then those who don't.  Good luck.|`|iCWKhbJSaa	First off, I am really sorry you have to deal with this. <br>  Have you tried sitting down with you dad and asking him why treats you this way and barely talks to you? If talking doesn't work you can keep trying, but it probably won't do much.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Gh0QHgUqaa	Do not bother. He is indeed very cold. He abandoned you! Do not forgive him!|`|qlhDCAPyaa	if they do like that then probely no|`|3NoQuoWuaa	I don't know I would wash my hands of him but I sure wouldn't be going out of the way to make contact with either one of them. This will be your dad's loss, not yours. However, if he comes to you, be open to establishing a relationship if that is what he wants to do.r|`|rMuWsjRWaa	No.........................................                                            <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't even try. Why would you put up the effort if he is not going to?|`|AA11637217	My stepdaughter and my husband have had a really rough relationship too.  My husband has tried to work with her on the relationship but they just don't get along very well at all - their personalities clash big time for some reason.  Even though they both agreed to let things cool off for a while, she continues calling him - daily most of the time - and some days even three or four times a day.  And they are not very nice calls when she does call - she whines and complains and asks for money, etc.  It doesn't sound like you are doing that at all - I only used that as an example to say that if she would back off a little and give him time to think about things, I believe they could one day have a good relationship.  With everything you've tried and it hasn't worked, the best thing for your sanity and peace might be to step away from it for a time and give your dad and stepmom room to think about things.  And don't beat yourself up - you've tried and done your part - now it's up to him.<br>  <br>  What I've discovered in my husband is that he has felt so guilty for how things turned out with his daughter, that he struggles horrifically with that guilt and doesn't quite know what to do with it.  The more she calls him, the more that guilt is in his face and he doesn't respond well at all.  I don't know if that is true with your dad too, but it could be a possibility.  I know in our situation, if my stepdaughter would take a break and give my husband some time, I believe he would call her eventually instead of her having to be the one doing the calling.|`|AMvR4u2Taa	This is a tough one and as much as you do not want to hear this you are going to have to follow your own heart here. My father left when I was 4 and I just "meet" him 3 years ago when I was 19. Of coarse our circumstance may be different but my father turned out to be a real loser. If someone doesn't love you enough to give you their time and affection then don't even bother with them it will only end up with you being hurt. You dad missed out on important years of your life and it seems like he is ts till missing out. Maybe you should put the ball in their court and leave the next move up to them, you have gone above and beyond as a child. Good Luck I know how hard this is.|`|Df3EdAynaa	I'm so sorry......it is very difficult for a person to live like that. Also, religion says that no matter how evil the parents are, the daughter/son should never insult them.who do you live with? i did not understand. u call ur dad and step mom but where do u live? r u an adult? well.....if u r married and ur a girl or boy tell ur husband/wife about this. live ur own life. u r indepedant. ur grown up u can handle ur family and urself<br>  <br>  if u mean u r 11 years old right now, then I am sorry do you have any siblings? if not......you can still mind your own business, make good choices of friends who will be there for you, and talk to them, stay with them. call kids help phone they can give better advice. i dont remember the number......but everyone knows about it. go to msn if u have it, it gives kids help phone. get advice from a teacher your confurtable talking with, and then he/she may give you some advice of what you should do. overrall, with this situation u will obviously be sad and uncared about; maybe when your father grew up he was treated that way so he doesnt understand how it feels to you. talk to him about it; if it doesn't work, u have friends to be with. or ur siblings if u have any. pray to GOD; theres a saying, "whatever happens, happens for the good". believe in GOD and things should be fine. good luck.|`|z9ey2Uqkaa	No, you shouldn't.  You shouldn't spend your life chasing him, but you should always extend an olive branch and meet him halfway.<br>  Two stories:<br>  The first one is from the TV show West Wing.  The one guy Toby is estranged from his dad because his dad was a criminal and a mobster when he was a young man.  The other guy, Josh, arranges for Toby's dad to come visit him.  Toby, in so many words, tells Josh to butt out.  Josh tells him, "You don't know what I know."  Toby asks, "what's that?"  Josh says, "Because I would give anything, anything to have a living father who was a felon, or a retiree or anything else for that matter."<br>  The second story is about my mom and my aunt, sitting at my grandmom's bedside before my grandmom died.  My aunt and my grandmom fought terrible for years, they didn't speak for years.  In the hospital, with my grandmom dying she said, "All those years we didn't talk, those were wasted, wasted years."<br>  Your dad doesn't seem like he's going to be father of the year any time soon, but you will have all the time you want without him when he's gone.  You only get a certain amount of time with him.  If he doesn't make the most of it, that's his loss, but don't ever put yourself in a position to say you were so lazy or so proud that years later you look back and call them wasted years.<br>  So reach out, always make sure there's a hand extended for him to take.
7a3dbb579b24e4b9fdf411db3dd96edaaa	this is a wierd story maybe you should just go talk kto her and him let your feelings out.it may sound kind of gayish but i mean if you like being his friends then it wont kill you

Id not chance it. You cant even get the terms changed without a huge diference in life situations too.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Depends on the laws in the state which set support.

The woman developed symptoms of bipolar disorder. She gave her husband a hell of a time. It's a wonder they are still together. The article said that her personality started changing rapidly - it's like she wasn't the same person he dated. This couple the article referenced, said that something about the change of married life somehow triggered the change in her brain - it didn't cause it, but the stress of it flipped the switch. She was properly diagnosed, went on meds, & they worked through their issues. <br>  <br>  Any chance this resembles the scenario with your wife?|`|tTsdeyfoaa	have you tried talking to her about this?

Just wondering. Sounds like she has a bad controlling issue. Have you tried telling her to back off and let you do your thing? Or even marriage counseling? I WISH YOU LUCK|`|WiyRmmrCaa	Sneak out at night for many hours and she'll suspect you are cheating.  Then you will end up in The Maury Show and she will leave you.|`|WItKOQh7aa	RUN. Get out NOW. Run and don't look back. It's only going to get worse.
DzAFT8VDaa	You need to find someone who is on the same page as you are. She wants more and you can't give it. Time to move on.|`|Yd1la6mLaa	Tell her that you don't want to get married. And that she can't force you into it. Or else, both of you will just live life like hell. Ask her if she likes that.|`|6qGY4cljaa	Because women want commitment. <br>  <br>  Sounds more like you see her as a friend then a potential partner. Perhaps you should tell her that?|`|XlOZRYWwaa	I think you should just be single and enjoy your time that way, it doesnt sound like your right for each other.|`|62d529835d9def01b918fb0dc7ef46c9aa	Hold on jackass, if you like being single and living alone why are you in a relationship?|`|aNYA9KjHaa	how old are you?<br>  tell her exactly how you feel<br>  grow up|`|jjDZJmfpaa	So break it off! Phew, that was easy!|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Do yourself, and her, a favor and stay single. You are not husband material.|`|AA11785285	Sure.<br>  <br>  Dump her... level with her... what she wants (marriage) and what you want (living alone) are miles apart.  And you need to be up front and honest.... that at this time you are just not into a committed relationship.  And since she is, adios!<br>  <br>  You'd expect her to tell you the same, if the roles were reversed.|`|aLgY4l3Naa	You both obviously don't have the same ideas for your lives, so why stay in a relationship that is going to just cause some kind of drama in your lives? Sit down with her and let her know your not into the whole marriage thing and you know you cant give her what she wants and so its time to move on in life, yes she will be hurt and maybe even angry but why let this continue if you both clearly know what you want but are not going to get it from each other, ITS JUST TIME TO MOVE ON!! Just don't play games, be mature and do the right thing!! Good luck to you!!|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	You two are not suited for each other.  You need to break up with her.<br>  <br>  Your goals are differnt and your interests are different.  She's looking for Mr. Right and you're just looking for a great lay.<br>  Give her up.|`|e0ca1dfae9043031c9846ab40f86b529aa	you like where you are in life. tell her exactly what you said here and see what happens.|`|5oj5YfKMaa	Let her go so she can find a REAL man who is willing to commit to her!
OwfoyXpraa	Call her. (:<br>  <br>  Just be like, "hey, how've you been? I've missed having you around, and I think we should catch up," or something along those lines. Why would she be mad if you called?<br>  <br>  Just start talking to her on the phone, then call her every little while and chat with her to rebuild the friendship. Stay in touch, and the rest will work itself up from there. (:|`|cwsaoLJhaa	I see no problem with you being the adult and making the call. Just call and act interested in her life, and then pop the question about the party. The worst she can say is no, which would be very imature of her to do if you two never had a problem.
lJUyhMceaa	You know her better then we do.  When you knew her before, was she open to your friendship?  If so, go ahead and call her.  Simply introduce yourself and ask how she is doing.  If she wants to talk to you, you will know by the way she responds.  If you sense that she did not want to talk, simply apologize for contacting her and hang up.  Otherwise, maybe a strong friendship will start.  Good luck.
nkiwlf7Paa	As long as Steve still likes you, don't worry about Jack - he might really want to be friends and he may just be acting this way becasue he has a thing for lisa and wants to agree with every little things she says.  ahh the troubles of youth lol...|`|xKRuPsIzaa	Just start talking. If they have a prob with it... Well it's there's not yours
jBigEy0Caa	Well you will never be able to make her do anything.  Another thing to keep in mind that this woman will be a part of your life as long as you are with him.  Keep being the bigger person and someday the kids will thank you for it.|`|wzqahEqiaa	Some people will never change and the ex wife will probably get worse if your boyfriend ever gets married again.  Try and suggest that they get some counseling.  The emotional scars the children may suffer will cause problems in the future.  If the children can get counseling it may help them understand the circumstance.|`|AA11496842	Refuse to have anything to do with her and her drama and tell your husband he better learn how to handle his ex.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Been there, done that. When ours made plans that involved our nights and they of course called to cancel, we would trade instead. She can't keep them doing something every single night, just don't give her the option of saying no. Say "if they are busy tonight, then would Wednesday or Thursday be a better trade for you?" She'll get the hint that it's not working. The kids will also want to see him and will figure it out too. If his son is crying, dad just needs to remind him that rumors have no validity and he need not believe everything he hears.|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	This is not your problem, especially since you aren't even married to the guy.  You need to back out of this situation.  I think every smart parent should put into their custody papers that as long as they aren't remaried, no gf/bf are allowed to ever be around the kids.<br>  <br>  My daughter's bf has this arrangement.  True, she'll never meet his kids until they are married, but it takes the pressure off her to get so involved with the children and ex-wife.  The children can't come to their house if my daughter is there, but she works every other weekend during the visitation.  While she would like to meet the children, the relationship between the ex's seems to be better than most because of no interference.<br>  <br>  I seriously doubt the jealousy is on her part, since you are the one that brought it up.|`|EMKuBql8aa	She is really insecure, she sounds like she is a entitled brat, she thinks she is wronged somehow by you being with him is my guess. <br>  <br>  Get yourself some caller ID for when it is the dads day, then don't pick up!! Do not let her manipulate the kids by planning stuff on purpose. Let him be the bad guy by saying no, it isn't a competition after all, he is as much to blame by playing her game, enabling the behavior by giving her her way and thinking of it as "bad guy/good guy" <br>  <br>  Just ignore her, he needs to have his days no matter what because she can then take the hours he really is spending with the kids at court and say, "look...he is only spending 20% of the time with the kids when he should be spending 30%!!" Even if she is the one manipulating the situation, don't fall into her trap. And if he does and you had someone warn you, well, it is now his own fault.|`|jjDZJmfpaa	I would like to write something profound but I can't get passed why you would stay in so much drama? It sounds really new and there is so much about the two of them you will never know - believe that!<br>  <br>  Know that the children are going to grow up and even with her doing what she has done, it won't get any better and the children will resent you. Those kids mean more to him than you do; so before you get hurt, you need to do some reconsidering for yourself.|`|BHGWdN8maa	U should run....fast|`|3f04d9ffb6ff4f3a0291d329acc40e45aa	wow. that just stupid. at first when i seen this question i was just going to say she is his ex you knew about her (hopefully) before you two got together. but that isn't the case. She needs to grow up completely maybe she is just jealous cause now you have him. and your there with the children. i don't know. i wish i did. hope things get better. i guess at a curtain time at night turn off the phone so she can't call all the time when you two got the kids maybe that would kinda help. cause if you two got the kids, then their isn't no reason why she should have to call you guys. right?|`|b8by7fSKaa	She is a miserable person and does not want any one around her happy because she's not.  <br>  He needs to contact a lawyer and document all these events that are happening.  It is not good  for a child to grow up this way, because if she is doing this to him in front of you, then what else is she doing when you are not there.<br>  Tell him to grow some back bone and stand up to her.  If he is seriously thinking of his children (and that is where his focus should be) then go for full custody.  This is not a time to be "politically correct" but to shield the children from further emotional abuse.<br>  Why is he allowing her to do this to his children??? Call a lawyer now!!!!
LYDVekF1aa	Tell him why you broke up with him. Be honest.
NeBDl4Hfaa	You're talking to another guy and you already like him so, yeah you might need to breakup completely.  You're complaining about your guy way too much to stick with him.|`|u7LSohRyaa	If your husband can't resolve the issue of his temper and childish behavior, it probably means that you'll have to break up for good. That's sad for the kids but if you're scared of him, then they're not safe with him either and are learning some bad behavior.<br>  <br>  Dump the past and come up with a new plan whether it involves being together or apart. You still have a family to raise. Admit together that you tried to make it work for a very long time but it's just not good for you to be together. Then you can make a pact to forgive each other and be friends for the sake of the kids at least.<br>  <br>   Just make sure you get all this resolved before you start a new relationship and don't have the new man overnight when the kids are home for awhile. They might be jealous that you're with a stranger instead of their father. Good luck.|`|Pdex43zgaa	Thats a lotta **** to read!!!!|`|rMuWsjRWaa	Umm....Prolly stay together because you have 2 kids. Think about your kids before yourself.|`|JRRsjByCaa	it seems as though you two aren't meant to be together. start spending as much time with your kids and don't worry about another relationship now with another guy.|`|Q887qawLaa	Well since you have kids I thnk you should try really hard to stay together becuase you dont want to ruin this for your children too. But if you are REALLY unhappy and fighting and all that you also want yourselves to be happy and you dont want your children to see you fighting so it all really depends. But still really try!!! If you were in love once you can be in love again.|`|c9ef9f6a7f9912c790ef88395bc2d81caa	welll it tough i know! but if u feel like being with him will cause more problems just move on! its hurts but you will find out if thats what u really wana do! if he loves you he will do everything in his power to get you back|`|d519c58276d1e99d5b07d211e3a674c1aa	I think you should break up for the sake of the kids. It's traumatizing for them to see their parents always fighting. I know it was hard on me when my parents would fight. Things were much better after they separated. But it is important that you stay on good terms with him. Things will be so much easier for everyone if you can still be friendly and the kids can spend some time with you and some time with him, and have easy access to both their parents.|`|dnTRSObDaa	if you love him, the only real question is whether or not you want to give him another chance or not. he obviously has issues he cant deal with like a mature person, he needs to be aware of that, so just talk to him, if you can talk without screaming at each other! otherwise, take the high road, maybe youve just had enough? do what you feel is right anyway, dont try to make anybody else happy, hes gotta do that himself.|`|jFwKyjT8aa	I think you already know the answer, and it might seem really hard to do, but you need to stay apart from him. Throughout everything you wrote, I didn't see you mention anything positive about him, only negative. A guy that has cheated on you, doesn't care to have a job, has a bad temper, and doesn't treat you the way you deserve to be treated definitely does not deserve you! Please, just focus on your kids right now, they're the most important thing in your life You don't want them growing up in a negative environment with a dad like that. Believe me, they'll be much happier in the long run without him around. Good luck with everything, and please make the right choice!|`|lbrQiyAvaa	Omg! is everything allways my fault for one I stopped cleaning cause u wouldn't clean im tired of cleaning after u and another who got the kids 24/7 i do how the hell am i gonna get a job watching the kids when i have no vehicle i got rid of all my cars and even my insurance money to get u things and for another When we moved in the trailer i realized the internet had to stop so i did i verly Got on it and why we fighted because i did all the cleaning around the places we stayed at and u did nothing i had to mention something to u and u get pissed off.. and start yelling and i ask u nicely to stop yelling at me and u continued then u start to like a hobo... that is 19 years old and u think he wants to be with u and **** if i was 19 u had 3 kids haha i wouldn't be with u unless i needed sex..... i never did anything wrong all u do around town to all your friends and say bad things about me so u can cover up the stupid **** u do one day someone gonna hurt u because they aint gonna deal with your ****... u neglect your kids for that damn cell phone and myspace Get use to it U are on the computer and the cell more then i ever was ..... so everyone say what you want about me but get to know this scumbag drea and u will see who was better and who the loser is
LYDVekF1aa	Be honest with her and tell her.  She will probably end up finding out anyways so it is best if she hears it from you first. She might be mad but if she is a true friend she will forgive you.
71VRvldJaa	That's a lot of baggage for an 18 yr old girl to take on!  He's obviously not good with committment.  Think of where you'll be a year from now!  You'll be 19 and he'll be 23 with three baby mothers!!<br>  Don't set yourself up for a lot of hurt and hassle.  You're just getting started in life......don't start with this kind of baggage.  It will weigh you down and you'll be miserable!  You can do better and you're worth more!|`|E7TkNO00aa	If your okay with this, like kids, stay with him. If you don't feel comfortable, look for a guy with no responsibilities. There are still some guys left with no kids.|`|eO35QeTeaa	I am in the same boat as you. I am too stupid to leave this guy. I really do love him and want to marry him. Don't be me, leave him before it is too late. Everyone always asks why i am with him and that i better be careful because i will be baby mama number 3. Just use protection and be on birth control. He obviously didnt have a problem leaving the other two girls who were pregnant. What makes you think he wont leave you because he loves you? Think about your future. There are a lot of young guys who dont have children let alone two from two different mothers. Plus, your guy is probably going to be broke a lot of the time paying two separate child supports. I'm sorry, paying two separate child supports if he is a responsible person and not some immature jerk who wants nothing to do with his kids. Choice is yours.

BvZvZaxzaa	Sounds to me like you want what you can't have. Are you really in love or jealous? You stated you fell in love with her only AFTER trying to convince her not not give in to his pressure to have sex. This is the key. If she has strong values, she'll do the right thing without your help. If you push too hard you'll appear jealous and she'll probably resent you. Spend more time with her until you're confident she feels the same way before sharing your feelings. Best of luck and be careful you don't get stuck in the friend zone.|`|RozPyjf5aa	I would definetly tell her how you feel.

If so, and she wants a divorce then love her enough to let her go. She may one day regret this or you may one day wonder why you never did it sooner. Life goes on and you will survive this, although I imagine at this point you think you won't. If need be, see a counsellor and work through your issues. Time really does heal all wounds. This is never easy for anyone. We always think love is forever and then life throws us a curve ball. One piece of advice, take it just one day at a time. It's much easier this way than to think or deal with everything all at once or in a day. God Bless|`|ByUS0k8waa	If you want you can go to the court date and say that you still love her and feel their is a chance that the two of you could work it out. Also if you hire a lawyer they can help to assist you in stopping the divorce. Both people have to agree and sign the papers in order for the divorce to be granted by the judge. At least that is the way my state does it. Normally the papers she sent you have a page that says what to do if you don't agree with the divorce. You can call the court house in your county to find out what you need to do if you cant afford a lawyer.|`|2keIEMFUaa	First of all you need to find out just how she feels about you and your marriage.  Then you need to cook a nic dinner or some thing and invite her over so you both can sit down and listen to one another and I mean listen first, then you'll have your turn to talk as well, both of you need to speak about your feelings and how can we together save this marriage.  A marriage is some thing you have to work at harder than anything else in this world.  You are to love unconditionally, respect one another, and most of all talk, talk talk things out and communicate with one another in order to make it work.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	If she wants the divorce, there's nothing you can do to stop her.

I think you may be looking at one of the hardest things we do, cutting off a part of our past when we aren't ready.|`|meroRGRgaa	if you love your wife try to explain that you may not need to take such drastic measures as divorce, maybe a separation for a while will help.. but if she has her mind set then theres nothing you can do about it, you cant make anyone love you.|`|dEb85e07aa	try to talk to her about it and maybe suggest a marriage councelor
BdvGQAqhaa	i would tell her what you have told us . Ask her what is wrong that you 2 used to talk a lot and now it seems as if she is avoiding you, and if you have done something to offend her that please tell you and if so,you are sorry and certainly didn't mean to and that you really miss you 2 talking alot and that you enjoyed her conversation,that if there is anything you can do to get things back to where it used to be let you know and you'll do your best to make it happen,as you really like her alot .|`|vfv7YqhPaa	She's trying to play hard to get. She thought that if she got to close to you, then she would be too available.  Keep trying. Start conversations that you know she will be interested in, not things like what's the answer to  #8.  If she does not respond to this tactic, then you should tell her how you feel without blowing up in her face. Explain to her just what is in your explanation above: tell her that you miss the conversations you used to have.

If you play it cool and start treating her just like a friend and keep a bit of a distance,  she will most likely feel comfortable again and things will probably go back to normal.|`|TkgVGbj5aa	She might of moved on and found someone else, and is not interested in you anymore, or she might of found out that you like her and is uncomfortable around you now, or she likes you too, and is shy around you.|`|Rq4p88V4aa	If she knows about it, she probaly is staying away. i think it makes them uncomfortable. i like a girl too, and she doesn't talk to me that much too. weird|`|1liObKb9aa	maybe she sensed you liked her and she didnt like you back.  so she felt like "oh great, well i dont wanna lead him on so maybe i should just not really talk to him till he moves on..." you know what mean?|`|SQUx0CPAaa	Ask that ***** what the **** her problem is and if she continues being a child then **** her she isn't worth it.|`|hAr60kMNaa	Well start by asking her why she's doing this.<br>  then you might be able to understand.|`|wFBaJUwIaa	I agree with Glen.

Maybe your friend is acting that way with you because she probably feels the same way about you. Maybe you were going too fast for her, so she got scared , which is normal. Find a way to tak to her and tell her how you feel. Good luck.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  You want her to be more than a friend she is not interested.<br>  <br>  Just come out and tell her what wrong.

She is trying to leave you stump. I can see its working now cuz you got her on your mind all  the time. If she continues to ignore when you are still trying give her a taste of her own medicine. She is going to notice it is not working and just start talking to you all over again.|`|VzzQP2PJaa	Well maybe when you catch her on the internet again, try telling her how you feel and that you want to talk to her more often. Let her know how your feeling, and if she still doesn't appeal to that...well then you know what you have to do. But don't give up without at least giving it a try. Hope this helped, and hope things work out for you.|`|CVWizvy6aa	She only likes you as a friend. You threatened your friendship when you confess to her how you feel knowing that she doesnt have feelings for you. You made her feel pressured and awkward.  She's avoidng you because of that.|`|cMEwV8V3aa	as a girl... once i find out a guy friend likes me more then a friend.. i distance myself ITS SO FUSTRATING its like you ct have a  guy friend that doesnt want in ur pantsss grrrr!

HWWORgpYaa	What exactly are you doing that's a bad influence? And chances are that if it is a bad influence,it isnt good for you either. Like doing drugs or something like that. So if the problem lies within you, maybe you need some help as well. Talk to a parent or an elder that you trust to see what could be wrong. If its really bad...see a therapist or something.
ztujP8Oraa	This must make things very awkward and uncomfortable for you. I have been in a similar situation. Forget making them a meal, or such to try impress them. Sounds to me like they are jealous that their son is giving someone else his attention now, in which case THEY are the ones with the problem Not you! If this is true then DO NOT let them make YOU feel bad about yourself as THEY are in the wrong for being like this and it doesn't matter what you did or what you will do in future, they will still try to push you out for fear of being replaced in his heart. Remember you don't have to prove yourself to them. Do you know about previous girlfriends? How they were treated? If you truly love each other then he wont let his parents come between you and when they realise that you are standing strong together they can either start being more accepting of you, (and the fact that their little boy is now a man),.. or they can risk losing him for good. I would suggest you get together with your boyfriend and confront the parents. Say you are genuinely sorry if you came across as rude, but that's not really who you are and that you really care for their son. say you don't feel it is fair for them to judge you on that one little thing so are hoping that you can all put this behind you and start again....If they still don't want to know then you have made your apology sincerely and the rest is down to them. (They should at least give you some respect for apologising)  .I hope this helps. Good luck :)|`|cFoeAynjaa	thats a really tough situation, but the best advice i can give you is just go hang out with your boyfriend and make sure his parents are there. just be as polite to them as you can. remember to say thank you and even if you have to, practice. you might look stupid while doing it, but seriously, it will be worth it. (:|`|65FeZ2aFaa	wow i feel 4 u i mean tey must be the stupidest parents ever you mite not act perfect around them because your nervous they should know that<br>  i think explaining to them your situation and that \your just nervous and not tiring to be rude.|`|z8AlY7Vmaa	Just face them face to face and they should see how worthy you really are (: just talk to them tell them you are sorry,and how you feel,and how much you love their son.Love has no limits.|`|KR9mFAZgaa	they are being VVEERRRYYYY immature....they should understand because they were once teens.so they should understand.. just tell them your reason that u said..you were trying to hard around your bf that u forgot...i hope they understand <br>  GOOD LUUCCKK <33333|`|P0RYeE8zaa	invite them over for dinner!<br>  tell them u are sorry for all you think u have done!<br>  its hard but give it a go it might make u feel better!|`|S5Y16O0yaa	yo, be yourself with him. don't think about and enjoy hanging out with your bf.

Always be yourself when you're around them, show them respect and don't go too hard. One thing to remember, what's really important is the relationship between you and your boyfriend because at the end of the day, the choice is gonna be made by your boyfriend not his parents. So, stop worrying about people that are trying to make your life harder. Stay with your boyfriend, enjoy the relationship, be yourselff and avoid the topics related to the situation of his parents and you....if it is real love between you and your bf, so you guys will confront that succesfully....|`|YAwvszITaa	Remember this-not everyone is going to like you (remembering this will make life easier) You don't need to be closer to them they sounds like jerks. I know you love your man but if he loves you he will not let them break you up. They sound like pains in the butts and I don't think you could become closer to them if tried because they sound dead set against you. With people like that you can never satisfy them. They seem to look down on you and that just shows what idiots they are. If it is meant to be you two will end up together & if not you just gotta move on.|`|qpmGLd7laa	Hmm... I say **** them.  If they're not stopping your relationship, they can just deal with not liking you.  It's really none of their business.|`|wZnx2mVyaa	You should probably tell them how you feel about this and why you deserve a second chance. Try to act like yourself in front of them.

cdt4F6ZWaa	You can bet any $$ he is wanting to hear from you again, even if it's been 11 years and he is married.  He probably decided that he couldn't take anymore, trying to get that chance to be with you.  So he gave up.  And now, after all this time, you don't know what he's doing, or if he's married. But now, if you don't try to contact him, you will wonder and wonder what could still be. <br>  <br>  So now you have to contact him, and I think you should send him a very simple letter, and tell him what happened but leave it short.  Even if he's happily married, divorced, or doing other things, at least you know that you did give it that chance.<br>  <br>  But what if he jumps at the chance to see you again??  Will you be ready?  Even though you've been divorced only 6 months, you already know this man.  But you'd have to give yourselves time to get to know each other again.  If he's available, don't rush into anything but at the same time, make sure he doesn't get away!!  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|ugNH8FMYaa	You're not alone - I too do this even tho I'm happily married. Not the "what if" (as I like my hubby!!) but just thinking of the ex & wondering how his life turned out.<br>  <br>  W/ myspace, facebook & the net - you can check up on him to see if he's married first. If not - give the guy a ring, even if it's only to be friendly.|`|UnEQAsEEaa	Definitely look him up and catch up with him.  I found out at a school reunion that my 'ex' from way back had died.  Though we had not seen or spoken to each other in many years, I had occasionally wondered what became of him and I'm sorry we shall never have the possibility now of even a friendly conversation about our mutual past.|`|WT9cjXtIaa	Yep... try 26 years. I broke up with a girl when I was 18. I got scared too, but looking back I probably should have kept the relationship going and married her.|`|jJ7wify0aa	Easy answer. Do you believe in your marriage? Do you believe in marriage?<br>  If you do, then STOP thinking about "what if"s".  Do not allow your mind to travel down the what if road.  You will only poison your marriage.  <br>  We all have what if's.   We don't all act on them or entertain them.|`|5b84350c247202a0fd3e66f2f0e4a355aa	Yes, it's normal.<br>  <br>  Contact him but leave it ambiguous. Just be friendly and act as if you wanted to just see how he is doing or something. <br>  <br>  Chances are 90% that nothing will come of it like you would want. But  it's worth a try and you could get lucky.|`|bSjbVxO2aa	Look him up and say Hi. <br>  <br>  Find out the scoop on him. If he's single, go for it. <br>  <br>  If he is married, you know now is not the time for you two.|`|GIsmTQr9aa	I bet he still thinks about you too.|`|gLqX7TG0aa	you're not crazy,...go ahead..give it a shot..who knows..he might be single|`|3ioUdPuZaa	Yes it is normal. Apparently, at least for him, you two had "something" special...that magic something. It seems to me your magic just hit at two different times in life. <br>  It's not crazy, but that doesn't mean it is something "real" either. Fact is, as I believe, anyway, that several things could be at play here. <br>  You COULD just be suffering from your marriage failure and looking BACK to someone who thought the sun rose and set in you (especially since your ex doesn't anymore, right?) So you NEED the self-esteem boost. And there are ALWAYS the "what if's." No one knows the answer to those but God. The fact is...THEY DIDN'T.<br>  But there IS something else I believe. I think that an All KNOWING GOD sometimes leads us in paths for reasons only He knows and toward an end that accomplishes something HE sees as important. When God leads us, it is always through our thoughts, dreams and through that "little voice" inside that we do not always listen to. <br>  God COULD be leading you to "make contact" again. WHY? Don't get your hopes TERRIBLY up because God works in mysterious ways. IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT HE SEES YOU TWO BEING TOGETHER HAPPILY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES...OR IT MIGHT!<br>  It could be simply because YOU need the experience of remembering and touching base right now...or perhaps HE is going through something and HE needs your input into his life right now. OR it could be that God wants to SHOW you something that will make you thankful for the life you DID CHOOSE. It could be a catalyst God is using toward bringing you and your ex-husband BACK together or toward giving you more thankfullness for the time with him and your children (if any). WE JUST DON'T KNOW.<br>  But my GUT says you NEED to touch base or at least check up privately to see what is up with this old flame. IF HE IS MARRIED, check it out a little to see from afar what might be going on, then leave it alone. <br>  Sometimes our mind is ALSO open, not just to God as it should be, but to Satan and his deception as well. <br>  You shall know them by their works is a Bible quote. This goes for everything in life. God would NEVER have you break one of his ten commandments, so your "thoughts and dreams" may be from another source. If you perceive ANY negative to your "pull" toward this old flame, run the other direction and do it quickly. <br>  God is good...his works are good and his intentions are ALL good. If this pull toward your ex is a good one, follow it. <br>  AND YES, FOR GOODNESS SAKE MAKE CONTACT, YOU WILL GO CRAZY IF YOU DON'T!!!!!!!!!!! What can he do, bite your head off?<br>  Realize the negative possibilities and SHOOT FOR THE GOLD!<br>  Good Luck!<br>  Bunny7<br>  P.S. God led me back to my ex-husband after 15 years of no contact. It has been a mixed blessing. But I am sure it WAS God who did the leading, even though we may not actually STAY together. Cannot go into it now, but remember ONLY GOD knows the path and the end result. Believe their is a REASON and follow God's lead.|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	Don't think about him, LOOK, time changes people, even if feelings are the same for both of you, there is absolutely no point looking back!<br>  <br>  You should look forward, look around you, start dating new people, the reason is: You have changed, he has changed, what are the chances that you both changed in the same direction? Same growing up???? very little, but what are the chances of you finding someone that is compatible with you today??? much higher,<br>  <br>  If you think you are attractive, believe it, <br>  <br>  And start taking some risks, instead of going back trying to play the safe card!!!! you moved on from your marriage for a reason, you have been successful in your career for a reason,,,<br>  <br>  Take it from me, when you have moved on, NEVER look back, there was a reason you moved on.|`|ibaLRXY2aa	First of all, I recently googled my high school sweetheart on Facebook and saw that he was still as hot as ever. I am still wondering "what if" my parents hadn't been so damn strict and had let us be together. I'm 40, so it was almost 25 years ago.<br>  <br>  Secondly, it sounds like things with your hubby are hitting a rough patch or you wouldn't be thinking so much about your ex. Do NOT look up your old boyfriend or you will probably end up having an affair with him. This is not what you need right now. Decide if your marriage is worth working out. If not, then get divorced and THEN look up your ex. Otherwise, you're going to end up hating yourself.|`|m1ohhvEHaa	It's possible that he will have moved on by now. But it is also possible that he's available. If you don't try and find out, you will never know and you've lost for good. At least give it a shot and see what happens. Even if he's married or isn't interested, you can then focus on being single. There are plenty of fish in the sea.|`|SckWdjnVaa	Its natural....u r not crazy! As u r single, sub-consciously ur mind is looking for company & has stopped at this man...so u cant stop thinking about him.<br>  <br>  Try finding out about his present status through common/his frens. No harm sending him a mail stating 'Thinking Abt U' & waiting for his response !!! <br>  <br>  If he is married, leave him! Im sure there are other kind & good souls around who would be interested in an attractive lady like u!<br>  <br>  Good Luck....|`|pTlnCNYJaa	Yeah you are crazy, you had your chance several times and chose your current marriage so get on with it and leave your ex to get on with his life.  Dont F up his and your husbands lives.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	Yes it's normal especially when a marriage ends.  Call him; even if he is married you could catch up on what's been going on over the last 11-14 years.|`|1OJgKMzVaa	Don't live in the past move on 14 years is a long time its a big world out there.

He got married and had a family.  I had a series of crappy relationships.<br>  <br>  For 18 years he was my friend, kind and good to my family.  He was always there for me.<br>  <br>  Six months ago, we started seeing each other, and we are totally happy, and love and respect each other.<br>  <br>  Every day I regret the 18 years I lost being with this person every day.  I do wonder what if I had been the one he married at age 20.  Maybe I'd have been the woman who made him miserable for all of those years, instead of the one who gets to make him happy now. Who knows?<br>  <br>  All you can do is make each other happy every day, for the rest of the time you have.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	"what ifs" are exactly that! If it was meant to be you would of been with them already...Let it go and move on.|`|rPywKtJRaa	yes it is normal.....you won't know unless you call him,<br>  be prepared for him to be married.  Now I want to know what happens.  You can what if till the cows come home.  Im sure he will be glad to hear from you.<br>  Carpe Diem.
ESRIk8fnaa	I'm pretty sure I have.<br>  Ever since I've seen him, I've liked him.<br>  Got to know him more; loved him.<br>  It's been 4 years.I love him more and more each day, but he's not mine. He never has been. I actually have a chance with him now, but I have a boyfriend who has depression problms, && I'm afraid if I leave him, he'll do something bad... So I'll just have to wait it out && hope...

You should never hold a grudge on a person, because it always come back and catches up with you. The story isn't really detailed enough for me to give an accurate response. You should be the brave one to go up and talk to her. It will be a great feeling once you to talk again. Friends are not meant to hurt each other, they are for guidance and to help you enjoy life. Although you two may have many disagreements, its your job and her job to overcome these obstacles. Life isn't easy, so don't make it harder on yourself.|`|BlA60kDVaa	Would you consider advice from strangers acceptable in your final decision ?
7pJ8S0Liaa	My definition is, someone you put before yourself.  Someone you would want to see happy even if it made you unhappy.  Someone you would be willing to give your all too.  Someone you would be willing to give up if it was what they really wanted.  Even though it would break your heart, you would give up what you want to just see that they was as happy as can be.<br>  <br>  I have found this type of love!  True Love.  I would die a thousand times just to spare his life once.  I put him before all my own needs.  I would do anything just to see him smile just once.  I would set him free if I had too.  If I felt he didn't love me, the same way I love him I would set him free so he could find the love that I have found in him.  His happiness means more to me than my own!<br>  <br>  Have you ever loved someone so much?|`|iW80AcLgaa	non existent anymore|`|AA11881071	Love is the strongest emotion known to man and the greatest gift one can receive. ..Love is   patient,and  kind and never demands it's own way.

It will hit you when you least expect it, and take over your existence O.o  Personally, I feel like love is a bit of everything. It is respect, it is jealousy, it is possesiveness, it is willingness, it is loyalty, it is pain, it is ecstasy, it is ignorant and blind, it is unconditional.  There are different types of love, sure, but I believe when you fall in love you truly want to live your life with someone and make them happy.  Sure, on a primal level, you are just feeding your own emotional needs by keeping him/her happy and secure, but it is so much more than that.  To me, love is honesty, respect, uncondtional, communication.  They become my best friend.  I want to take care of them, clean for them, live with them, come home to them, and cook for them.  It makes me want to do all the wifey stuff I disowned years ago lol... hope that sorta helped... as longwinded as it was :)|`|5vbrHrzvaa	please read through<br>  <br>  lets start with my definition of porn<br>  <br>  porn is an image or video you suddenly lose intrest in after climax<br>  <br>  and if you dont lose intrest in someone after you have sex with them or masturbate to them then thats love<br>  <br>  lol jk i dont believe in love|`|5kKkENvwaa	indescribable feeling of warmth, tingles and belonging. trusting longing wanting needing holding kissing touching lusting doing for, having every morning, ever day every night always and forever..<br>  <br>  Thats what i feel when i think of loving my husband..|`|RbCsBbhLaa	a feeling that can't really be explained in words.

90ht2JH2aa	Asking is natural but it comes from you caring a lot about her. I think if you just ask her not in a way that sounds like you're accusing her of acting the wrong way around you're friends....just say something along the lines of "I've noticed you're unusually withdrawn around my friends...did something happen to make you uncomfortable?"  If something seems off to you, do ask.  Even if nothing happened, it lets her know you're paying attention and you care.<br>  <br>  As for your friends, idk. definitely talk to them individually and not as a group, but maybe just ask if they noticed anything happen between someone and your gf that could have made her uncomfortable because she seems to act awkward around the group. just make sure you don't sound like you're accusing them personally, they should be fine with it.<br>  <br>  It does sound like something's bothering her about the group if she doesn't want to be left alone...that's usually a good sign that something's worrying/scaring her.  It could just be intuition...some guys just make girls uncomfortable. But something also could have happened.  If you talk to her and she says something just feels off, try to be understanding-it's a girl thing and it really can be legit. <br>  <br>  Props on being a good boyfriend-paying attention and not just assuming she's acting weird today and blowing it off.  That's a really good quality in a guy.|`|cmKzRJBNaa	You obviously care for your girlfriend. Let me ask you this, are your friends mostly girls or guys?

RtkB46peaa	I ask you this:  Do you want to know his feelings?  Do you honestly want to know what he thinks, how he feels, and what his wants and desires are?  Or do you, like so many others, just want to hear what he has to say so you can explain to him why he's wrong to have these feelings?<br>  <br>  That's why he goes to his buddy.  His friend will listen, give a bit of advice, and leave it at that.  You on the other hand, judge him, make him feel worse, and explain to him why his feelings are wrong, and yours are right.<br>  <br>  This is a classic problem.  Do you understand that "saying exactly what you're feeling, pretty much all the time" is what we men call "nagging"?<br>  <br>  He's not telling you how he feels because he doesn't think that you can handle it.  I guarantee it.  He won't admit it, because that would only cause MORE friction.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	This is a disaster waiting to happen hon.<br>  If you can not communicate NOW, then after you are married will be too late because you will have the SAME problem AFTER you are married.Also, if he is confiding in another woman, then this is going to stick in your craw big time after you are married.<br>  You either fix the problem NOW, or call the wedding off.Or you'll be divorcing later.|`|aNYA9KjHaa	hey listen he is not my fiance' he is yours so talk to him about it, youre going to marry him and be asking husband questions here next...|`|AA11785285	Sometimes it is best that all of us have a buddy to talk to... and sometimes the best any of us can do is to just shut the hell up.<br>  <br>  If you are blathering away as you did when you were 9, and still thinking that is okay, you need to readjust your thinking.<br>  <br>  And maybe he feels if he discusses some of his issues with you, it will just set you off.

Are you critical?)<br>  <br>  <br>  For sure couples ought to be open and honest with each other,  their needs and wishes, and for sure, be able to solve their differences without rage and resentment.....Buthere are things that perhaps he doesn't wish to share with you... It doesn't mean he is cheating, it means perhaps he finds you too needy, or too prying.<br>  <br>  Lots of us learn later in life that being too sharing with every little item doesn't make our marriage better... it makes it more stressful.   That's why it is always good to have a friend who will perhaps just listen, and be non-judgmental.<br>  <br>  Helpful?|`|7xCfyZDpaa	That is a major problem, if he is taking his problems to someone else then that means he trust someone else more than you. And besides what happens between you two, should stay only between the both of you and no one else. Confront and be honest that is something to check into before actually sighning the commitment!|`|FormN1Owaa	Definitely a problem. You are totally right. I'd try telling him what you told us first. If no headway, I'd try to start couples counseling. Otherwise, this could be an issue that sinks the relationship.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Tell him that if he can't communicate with you, then you can't marry him. Communication IS a HUGE thing in a relationship and if he can't communicate with you, then you need to find someone who can. Do you really want to marry him and end up divorced a year later because he never talks to you?|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I would hold off on picking a date for the wedding until you've worked past this issue.  My husband used to be the same way, but I was able to encourage him to open up, and he has gotten much better about telling me things.  Just keep reminding him that communicating about things is important, and make sure when he does open to you, that you reward him for speaking up rather than making him feel judged.  Good luck.
XmJZkFuMaa	It's a bit extreme.<br>  <br>  Most teenagers have fights with parents.  Some TERRIBLE.  My sister was horrible towards her girls, calling them names, treating them like they were confirmed sluts, and just treating them HORRIBLY.  Once they moved out, then they moved to adult relationships, and the healing was able to start.  She changed more, realizing that they were adults and on their own.  And they were able to simply shrug and walk away to their own home if she said anything hurtful.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying to set yourself up for more pain.  Distance yourself, maybe 30-60 minutes away at first.  And then just give her a year to three years and see if she changes.  Don't expect it overnight, every time I've seen it happen it takes 2-3 years typically. <br>  <br>  If she's still a wench when you've moved and you've given her a few years not that far away, then move further away.  Don't make it so she doesn't know how to contact you though, since she may have a change of heart with time and you may find her easier to deal with, when she does.  If you change your name, then give her your new name so she can find you.  Give her a way to contact you, even if it's just email so she doesn't know where you live.  But don't go completely at first, and don't burn every bridge.|`|bERQ3UCdaa	thats extreme. Just act like an adult and tell her that she needs to act her age. Don't do it with any sarcasim do it in a serious conversation most adults will relized they have been F*cking idiots and change. Atleast for a little while.

S2xWbrgpaa	If you just start dancing, it could weird a guy out. But definitely ask a guy! Boys like it when they dont have to do all the asking, like they are stereotypically supposed to do. If your nervous, try asking a guy that is of by himself and not already dancing.|`|KG9IJlt1aa	i just had mine to , first one without a date. People say that the guys sappost to ask you but 95% of guys want you to make the first move, so if i was you just go and ask the guy to dance . and to do it just ask as if you were the guy  , "hey, wanna dance or something"..."I was wondering if you werent already with someone, if you wanted to dance?..."wanna dance with me for this song?!"

AA12166274	Its a relly big deal when your friend dates your ex. Its like you ate half of your meal and she is eating whats left over. If she was a good friend she would not even show interest in your ex. Thats just dirty.|`|uBssj3Znaa	it depends on how good of friends you are and how much of an ex the ex is. <br>  <br>  If my friend dated the ex love of my life, I would be crazy pissed at her.

Does your daughter have any friends, because she seems to be a little lonely. If you had a fight with her and you were the one being wrong, I would say there is nothing wrong with buying her a little something, but not the other way around. She needs to face her responsibilities and learn out of her mistakes. My son is still younger but when we fight and he gets mad I just leave him alone for a while and he gets over it and even apologies. What you can also do is to spend some time with her and motivate her to have some friends. I would say she has a little bit of a obsession with the soft toys.|`|AYY9TkMJaa	I don't think there's anything to worry about. <br>  The reason why she sleeps with her teddy is probably because she feels lonely or maybe it's a teddy she got it from someone important? Or had it for a long time? I know becuase I have a teddy I got from my grandma when I was little and I always have it with me.<br>  <br>  I think your girl respects her rabbit as a part of the family. People who doesn't have a younger brother or sister, or people who doesn't have a friend, people who doesn't have parents have these cases. If she has everyone then maybe she just wants a child or another friend.<br>  <br>  My older sister is turning 23 this year and she loves cartoons, watches it all the time. I think maybe your girl loves cartoons too. There's nothing weird about an adult loving cartoons. Because I bet the adults who write cartoons love them =P<br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with her having polar bear teddy pictures and things on her laptop. She probably just loves polar bears a lot that's all. Like I have my room filled with figure skating things and posters, and my friend Becky has her room filled with Robert Pattinson posters and pictures.<br>  <br>  Everyone understands things in they're own pace. Don't worry too much about her. She'll probably understand everything soon. <br>  She is kind of like my little sister. Whenever I fight with my sister I just have to be quiet and wait. and my little sister just forgets about everything and starts talking about something else. But there's nothing wrong with her forgetting about it. I think it's a realy good habit. My little sister is like this too but your girl just got used to getting treated like that from when she was little. I think it's a realy good habit. Becuase people who can't forget about things have dificulties later on. <br>  <br>  Dont' worry about her. She'll be just fine. But if you realy want to make her grow up then maybe you can talk about breaking up. She'll probably start finding what was wrong with her and start trying to grow up. Or if she can't find what was wrong with her maybe you can tell her. There's all sorts of ways to make her grow up if you want to.
CBa9G4j4aa	Guess you will just have to trust the girl. And you can break your hymen by falling on your butt hard, and sports and riding a bike, many other things. Not just period.
uEIOgxWlaa	I agree with you honestly. I would want to make it special for my future girlfriend/wife and tell her that "She's my everything" and then kneel down and ask "Will you marry me?" and then I would hope she would say "Yes!". <br>  <br>  That would be a very special moment.|`|E25Q16N7aa	If the woman I loved wanted to get engaged Christmas eve then that is when I would propose so she could have her wish come true.  Honestly, I would get down on one knee to propose in front of her entire family (open the box with the ring) and say something like"For my Christmas gift, would you please make my deepest wish come true and marry me".  I would also first ask her father for his blessing.  I am a traditionalist at heart.|`|9849a01b6c224f3bf4c3c1bde0d97930aa	our anniversary is the 4th<br>  her bday is the 3rd<br>  in proposing at midnight<br>  <br>  fall

As long as you're nice and treat girls with respect (and don't act like a total stereotype), you're good!|`|1UZMBxpeaa	you are not ugly! just try to make girls laugh. humor is the key. then once you get the girls attention you can actually get to know them. be yourself. you are totally dateable. good luck!|`|drzN1kkuaa	You look like a creepster.|`|CKquZ8VWaa	everyone is datable|`|9DLsBJJQaa	dog no homo but if i was u id be gettin laid right now<br>  u aint ugly fo **** man<br>  again no homo|`|4v2ZTZvAaa	Ur cute!. . .i would totally go out with you!|`|uLHtXibRaa	OMG..you cant get a g/f!!!..you are wow!!!....your are 10/10!!!...ok drop me a line now i wont say no!!!!...|`|NqWl2qlPaa	I think you look good, maybe try to be more out going.  You have a nice face and body, but if you are 6'7" females may be intimidated by your size.  I'd expect if I saw you, that you'd be the type to make the move, so go for it.|`|mnasIFdZaa	Nooo way! your not ugly at all. Just hasnt been the right time yet. Dont worry your only 20.. you'll eventually get one. dont be in a rush, because usually wen that happens, you never seem to find the right one. You seem to have great qualities :). just socialize a bit more.<br>  goodluck!|`|WrOE1MYJaa	ummm your not ugly so u should be able to mabey ur to friendly and girls think of u as a girlfriend other than a boyfriend u no be more flirty tell a girl before ur her friend shes really pretty and see what happens|`|rkkyNwBqaa	your hot<br>  <br>  of course youre datable <br>  <br>  pls help<br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ahjedc41F.PMPajnnd6EEv_AFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090306205256AA5ICtL">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|LkOIRQc6aa	i serisouly thought you said " do i look disabled" and i was like haha lemme see!<br>  <br>  you look ok.  not my type...but i can see other woman would find you attractive.|`|koaVQVnJaa	You're not that attractive.

Are you kidding me with a body like that who wouldn't want you. Specially if you have a nice personality. But don't feel too bad i'm 25yrs old and i'm still looking for a bf or just to meet someone but now in days is so hard to find the right person and i know what it feels like because sometimes i feel the same way that you do.<br>  <br>  PS: The whole point is that you are datable!!! Good Luck.|`|fSgIQsUjaa	your handsome... there is always somebody out there for everyone...maybe you shouldnt post pics of your body because it makes you look like a player sorry :( You dont look like you would be one though. Beauty is only skin-deep. So you ARE dateable, everyone is. :)|`|6b7UXPUQaa	It doesn't matter what you look like that matters. Just be out there and not act cocky. Also, you need to be mature if you don't want to be just another hook up to someone.`|`|UdatjYEQaa	your actually really cute.<br>  i don't believe that you've never had a girlfriend.<br>  don't start thinking your ugly because your really not at all!<br>  go to some clubs, pick up some ladiess|`|sD8vfP75aa	Your hot I'm not going to lie. <br>  And I'm going to be honest once more you are defiantly date able!

But ur cute, chill on the workouts though...too much muscle|`|fBJ89X7yaa	You look pathetic. Never drop your vest and display your body. A woman likes to date a man who teases her. Had you been in your vest and just your shirt off then you would have got my number! lol you missed!<br>  <br>  <br>  Also never smile reavealing your teeth and your eyes grinning you look devilish!<br>  <br>  Grow long hair we woman like either bald or sexy hair of a man rubbing our face. A bald man we love to hold his head close to our cleavage it feels wonderful for resting our palm on a man's bald head when he sucks on us! Um uhh!<br>  <br>  You yakk look like a mickey mouse toy. No No No you are not dateable at all!|`|EMYImof1aa	i think you're really hot, idk why you would be single, i guess work on talking to girls and keeping up conversation, make the convo more about them and less about you, girls like that when you're interested in their lives. maybe you can meet a girl at your gym if you like to work out :]|`|CBa9G4j4aa	You're okay looking. Not ugly.|`|7h0qfos1aa	You're better looking than my boyfriend of 6 years, and I'm 21 :P. <br>  <br>  Haha, you're not ugly at all. Just be yourself & the right one will come along - don't try so hard that it hurts. She's more likely to fall into your lap when you're not paying attention!! <br>  <br>  G.luck|`|fR2Geezcaa	Your way date-able! Not to be shallow, but any girl that saw you without your shirt on would probably trip over her own feet.|`|AA11371251	can't be that your ugly cuz your not must be something else|`|rPywKtJRaa	yes you are datable.....but are you too nice?
XbGkjC4Taa	I see how being pounced on is relatively annoying as HELL.<br>  lol I've experienced it, even by people I do like... and still find it to be weird.<br>  <br>  Whatever you think of doing though, resort to the old saying, treat others the way you want to be treated. Believe me, karma is NOT pretty so don't be mean to this girl.|`|NzBjnqztaa	Get a restraining order?<br>  <br>  I dunno, just tell her that you need some "you time". That always works for me when someone is annoying me; but I think that you have someone that's a little "happy" on your hands, if you know what I mean.
KVzBqWhvaa	They are attracted to you and are flirting. Some guys are so weird doing that when you're with your parents. When that happens don't even look at them and just ignore them. It's annoying but I think that's the only thing you can do.. orr you can give them the finger to show that you're not interested lol jk.|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	They're flirting with you! sounds like they find you attractive, so they probably won't stop easily. Best thing you can do is try to ignore them, like not look their way or show any reactions to what they do or say.|`|C5hEgseMaa	are u gay? (no offence)
xRZ1PRZwaa	He's answered your question. He's going to propose, and he has a plan.<br>  <br>  Leave it, trust him and enjoy the moment when it happens.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps hon! Soon to be congrats...|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	There is no law nor rule out here that says the guy has to be the one who proposes so if youre tired of waiting for him since you blew his first attempt (which was probably a devastating blow to his macho ego by the way), then you propose to him. Good luck|`|SckWdjnVaa	Proposing a girl is a big deal for a guy! Probably he wants to do it in style & surprise you. So, chill & just stop worrying or pushing him!<br>  <br>  Probably, you can try getting him jealous by talking/ introducing him to some new guy that you have met / got interested in !!! If he has plans to propose you....he ll definitely hurry up! (Just make sure you dont talk too much about this new guy!!)|`|p7ofEUrYaa	Dont rush it, it wont make either of you happy if it doesnt turn out right|`|YPFWEcIDaa	when he's ready, he'll let you know   **** SWEET MILDRED SENT ME TO HELP YOU***|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	you remind me of my brother and his wife, she was so in love with him and was rushing to get married, my brother was still confused.<br>  <br>  Then they lived together and after 1 year that my brother realized he can live with her, he proposed and they had a very romantic marriage in a boat on the river and they are living very happily together. I am proud of them.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you love him as much as my sister in law, loved my brother to hang in there, and pull yourself back together, waiting patiently for the right moment, but I know that my brother wasn't ready at the time he was being pushed, because he had many fears, such as fear of commitment, or just marriage and because our parents, got divorce, he was always afraid of getting divorce, and wanted to make sure everything was right.<br>  <br>  Anyways, good luck, if it works out for you I hope he proposes soon and you have a romantic marriage.
wFu4VAC7aa	first of all I think long distance relationshops are hard to keep strong.

You'll find a way to work it out.|`|vR4k5iVCaa	as hard as it is its best you listen to your head because that's your brain telling you something is not right. your heart fools you sometimes into believing that its right or it will change but if your heads saying it won't work out please listen to your head|`|6ieeE3Pvaa	I don't know you or your boyfriend.

Not all women are innocent and docile as society tends to want us to believe.|`|DbNbWQflaa	anyone can choose the wrong person but that is how one learns , it is hard work to keep relationships going people grow and change, there are lots of reasons, men are not creatures they are human not perfect,it just didnt work, sometime we see through rose colored glasses . i have known women that has been married 3 times and some not ever, so go figure, life is a journey, have fun travel lightly,|`|AA12070007	First girlfriend usually means first piece of tail, for some reason that person will always stick in your head, even more so when love is involved.|`|rM5dypt6aa	yes sometimes we do that but not all the time...

Everyone is entitled to their preferences. If you find someone unattractive, it's best that you nip that in the bud. Spare that guy's feelings, and avoid wasting your own time.<br>  <br>  You're young; you're beautiful; live your life!|`|ybaG8ABGaa	Girl, everyone is not so superficial! Trust and believe I've seen super cute dudes with ugmo girls and vice versa. Some not so attractive people have wonderful personalities and are charismatic, which draws ppl to them. And sometimes these not so attractive ppl are promiscuous b/c they think the best they have to offer is their body.<br>  <br>  For you to assume that if someone's ex is ugly then they are ugly is a lie you've been telling yourself. Also you gotta realize, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the cutest boy in the world to you may be a monster to me.
xnIwI00daa	WELL, it depends on the girl. Some do and some don't. I don't. Some of my friends do. Can't really tell you exactly.<br>  <br>  But if your friend is trustworthy and it can be true. I have many friends who goes up to guys and tell them that they like their friends. But also beware, because the "like" CAN be interpret in many different ways.<br>  <br>  I tell people that I like some guys, but I don't always really meant it in the like-like way.|`|abeb89d2e01564e26bc76eaacacd2cc6aa	some girls do that! sometimes they'll reveal to the crush's friend that they like him (the crush) in hopes that the friend of the crush will tell....|`|NWpZNbiQaa	Well girls rare strange but i don't think she would lie best thing to do is find out for your self|`|I2OoEDczaa	she wouldn't say it unless she meant it

94e9881aaf81b5bc826d9d1e78bfe375aa	I think its perfectly okay.  People need to understand that you're moving away and that it's not practical to lug everything with you.  There's nothing wrong with slipping an insert into your invitation and saying 'monetary gifts appreciated because of the move.'  People do absurd things for weddings and showers and it seems like everyone has made themself the authority on what's proper and what's rude and what showers are for and what they're not for.  It's your day.  Do things your way lol.  As a guest, I'd appreciate you asking for cash instead.  It makes things so much easier.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	It is never acceptable to ask for cash.|`|8bTder08aa	Including any mention of gifts on an invitation is unacceptable, because etiquette is very clear on this:  your guests are not obligated to give you any gift at all.  <br>  <br>  All you can do is get the word out that should people feel that they want to give you a gift, you would prefer cash rather than something that would be a problem for you to take with you.<br>  ******************************<br>  Edit:  it's kind of borderline, but you can probably get away with putting words on the invitation to remind guests that you are moving to another country:  e.g., "You are invited to a party to celebrate [your name]'s approaching marriage and departure to [country]." <br>  <br>  You might also specify that the party has a theme, which is PORTABILITY; this is a rather broad hint, but within etiquette boundaries.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	If you haven't registered, that's good. Pass the words to your bridal party and your immediate family that you're not going to be able to ship gifts to your new place. Guests will ask them if you're registered and they can pass along the info.<br>  <br>  No matter what, you will still get gifts. There should be NO language about gifts anywhere on your invites.|`|GGd1EQn9aa	I think it is not nice to mention it on the invitation. How about asking the parents, attendants and a few relatives to pass this message around verbally. People should understand your situation.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Have your bridal party come up with some type of wording or poem to express that or on-line  bridalshowerpoems for free.com Dont assume or youll be bringing everything back for the cash.  Visa gift cards work too.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	If you only want money, then dont have a shower. <br>  <br>  Im sorry, but a shower is for opening gifts-- not envelopes with money. I also live abroad so I am sympathetic to your situation. What I did was ship my gifts, yes it was expensive but that was my responsibility as the receiver of the gifts.<br>  <br>  Showers are for gifts, not money. And its incredibly rude to put stipulations on your guests. If you cant follow those guidelines, then its best to not have a shower at all. Not everyone has a shower, and no one is entitled to one.<br>  <br>  ** I assume your guests know you are leaving. Give them a little credit. Writing that on the invitation is very rude, no matter what your circumstances.
2c3fad97ea8b5e911078dc2d53597dddaa	Yes. pakistani muslims are legally allowed to marry Christian, Jew and muslims women in pakistan.

ks2oieV0aa	I would tell my friend!  xox|`|Ss4bkvDgaa	as heard as it will be, tell you're friend,<br>  it's not easy; I know! but just bring it up,<br>  don't say that you like him, but say "me and him are hanging out today, I just wanted you to know.."<br>  Or you could actually tell her that you like him, and he likes you.<br>  If you do, she probably will be kind of mad at you for a few days,<br>  but oh well no ones perfect. <br>  If you don't tell her now, they word could get out, and you're friend would probably hear and she'll be even more mad then ever.|`|Dob2OhIYaa	do it. you  might not get another chance they didnt go out or anything so thats her problem for not saying/doing anything and if she cant accept the fact that he likes you then get rid of her and get new friends<br>  but definatly dont keep it a secrete that would just creat a huge mess|`|HmEZWD4faa	Tell your friend! If you keep it a secret, she'll find out sooner or later, and be extra mad about it.

It is such a sweet smell.  NO!  It is a bad thing.<br>  Your friend sees this guy and claims him then holds your friendship for ransom.  “Stay away from my man!”  But, it didn’t end when he rejected her, did it?  <br>  Now you are stuck in a codependent relationship with your supposed friend.  Where do you find these friends?  Oh, right.  You haven’t figured out how to play that adult game yet, have you?  You are still learning.<br>  This is how it works in the adult world.  Friends are supportive, not controlling.  Friends hope for their friends to succeed, not restrict them to failure.  Well, that’s how it is with my friends.<br>  So, play adult and see if you and this guy can become friends.  If your girl friend takes issue with it then she isn’t really a friend.|`|OyEEyIpdaa	Dont put him above your friend.  Shes been there for you, and you dont know him as well. Just talk to her.

iPNOVR6Gaa	Disclaimer: I take questions like this way too seriously.  It's just a fault I have.<br>  <br>  Answer: Assuming this mermaid was like mermaids depicted in mythology and on movies, I would ask her what she wants to do.  As a person with her own brain, it would be pretty bizarre for me to believe I had any right to do anything against her will.  I would not believe that I had any right to control what she did with her life - to do so would be slavery.  I oppose slavery.|`|qPDnxTE0aa	Let her go in peace.|`|7qoyVAIjaa	Sushi time!!!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	If my spouse said he found a mermaid, I'd tell him he'd been drinking too much salt water.|`|FXBCYFhuaa	If my spouse found a mermaid, I'd keep the mermaid in a swimming pool, and use the mermaid for sex anytime I desire.|`|CKd4bnV7aa	We'd have a foursome with the leprechaun I found last week and his new mermaid gal pal.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	Thank your lucky stars and let her go.

PcPswmv5aa	Yeah you gals never do anything wrong.|`|YMgm99gdaa	To answer your last question...yes.  I enjoy seeing people get all in an emotional funk over words.  People are too sensitive these days and just need to learn how to shrug off negative comments.  There are bigger things to worry about in life than what someone says to you.  Like...why is my neighbor getting a mortgage bailout for buying too much sh*t when I always paid my bills.|`|RtkB46peaa	I push my wife's buttons every now and again, but it's all in fun, and I know her "serious" face well enough to know when to knock it off.<br>  <br>  Men are not jerks for no reason.  Perhaps they had a bad day, or perhaps they're unhappy.  And perhaps neither is justification, but both may be a fair explanation.  The latter is more likely if it happens regularly.  If you want to know why he's unhappy, I can take a few educated guesses, and easily hit a few "bulls eyes".|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	I suppose the same reason women are to their mates hon.

jCRD7Aamaa	I don't see him and his girlfriend working out in the future she sounds very controlling and needy men don't like that type of behaviour. I would just ignore his girlfriend she is trying to have power over you just continue talking to your guy like she never interfered and what you two share is none of her business. by the way she sounds very immature and insecure he needs to drop her like a bad habit.Don't be weak stand up for yourself tell him your friendship means a lot to you and that you don't want to let someone like his lady friend ruin it. Loving him is okay but he isn't available to you like you want him to so be cautious for now maybe he will cut that other girl off and decide to have something more serious with you in the future obviously there is a reason he is talking with you.|`|Y1gaP1veaa	try talking to him again. lay it all out on the table. whatever you do though, try not to make him anti his gf because in reality that never works! you just need to call him and be like WE ARE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS. this is what the deal is|`|RzBaoGw4aa	No, don't let one person mess up ur friendship.|`|WkWNCZWdaa	just tell him how you feel, you're friends,  im sure he'll understand|`|czfyAyNBaa	i think u should explain it more and that a person that does that isnt the best gf so i dont think she will last long|`|Hw5eIMRYaa	the girls sounds trouble to me .... you should tell the guy that no girl is so imp in life which breaks friendships.

FQ8eYjQKaa	No, ur not truly inlove after one year, love is based on trust and honesty *sometime maturity*<br>  <br>  If me and a girl i had a crush on were together for 10 years, i might still just have a crush on her, but me and the girl i am with right now have been together for like, 10 days XD, and we love eachother, but thing is, b4 we told eachother, we knew EVERYTHING about eachother, and this is just an example<br>  Say at midnight on my laptop i watched porn while masturbating, she knows deeper secrets then that * i dont, i dont get the point of porn, u should be atracted to your partner, not random people on the internet*.<br>  <br>  So we had TOTAL honesty, and since we knew everything about eachother we trusted eachother to tell the truth, so when i told her i love her and i secretly have for a few months, and just pretended to like others, at that point, she knew i finaly told her everything, and she trusted me. and now she loves me, and b4 i told her, she liked me for 2 months because she said i was open, honest and trust worthy, see, trust worthy and honest. another link<br>  <br>   i loved her because we had those 2 key things, trust and honesty. Its something u need for love, and if u dont trust them, or arnt honest, secretly u know inside, ur love isnt true or isnt polished. and it isnt TRUE love.<br>  <br>  So to anwser it in short form<br>  <br>  No, time doesent equal love, trust and honesty equal love.|`|CEm8asvYaa	Nope.  You can be in a relationship with someone for a few months and fall in love, or you can be in a relationship with someone for over a year and never truly love them.   <br>  But there is a good chance that if you have been with someone for a year that you do love them.|`|sllWYyR9aa	Maybe, but time does not equal love. I have been with my gf for almost 3 years and yes we love each other, but its not because we've been together for 3 years.<br>  <br>  What is love? Love is when you care more about the other person than yourself and you want to see them happy, even if it is not with you.<br>  <br>  Do you feel this way about him and does he feel this way about you?<br>  <br>  If so, YOU'RE IN LOVE!|`|19k1ViJIaa	no, i went out with a guy for almost 2 years and we talked everyday and hung out a lot and we liked each other alot but we both knew that this couldnt be love. when your in love you know it. you have a feeling and everytime you see or talk to that person you have that feelingg.|`|9849a01b6c224f3bf4c3c1bde0d97930aa	love is a decision<br>  its a lifetime decision<br>  you may b ready to make that decision that u trule ylove eac other<br>  but u dont actually make it until you say i do at the alter|`|JZ8rkTykaa	not really<br>  Answer mine pleaase <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApNoFa85gddyg8IYxpvGyfTAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090306210009AAmmQJT">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|3EjaVKj6aa	probably but i thought i really didi love my bf after a year and he dumped me. so like u may love him but dont assume he feels the same about u|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Nope.  You can love someone earlier then that or you can go a whole year or years without ever really loving the person, just merely tolerating them or enjoying their company.  Or you could have loved them early on but are holding on to the relationship as it starts to crumble.  Love doesn't have a time scale.  Love is something that either develops or it doesn't.  And once you have it, if you don't feed it, it dies.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	no<br>  <br>  <br>  when you're married you do|`|e2I6Z9Cqaa	it depends how close you are. it may or may not it all depends, you could love him but he might love you to. have you asked him? love is a really strong word and way different from infatuation. this is a hard one for someone to answer just becuase it could be love or it couldnt it all does depend on how u truly know not think you feel, and vice versa with your bf. Look for signs that you think only people in true love would do or say, has he told you he loves u and showed u more then just dating experences and showed more things people inlove would do for one another? Think you'll find the answer dont worry though a year is a long time so dont stress if he hasnt told u already he will, guys do mature slower than girls.|`|csoqkiDKaa	Love is not a measure of time, it's a measure of trust and respect. When you love someone, it's a feeling you can't explain, not a number you can count to.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Usually, but that's not always the case!|`|IA4x5oPMaa	not necessarily
h6NqNzHAaa	I'm not sure but I think Clinton is gay, so I doubt they are dating.|`|R8N2QTU9aa	I dont think so! At first I thought that too but i think that Clinton is Gay so im pretty sur they dont... I think they are prolly best friedns.|`|yze7e7CJaa	No clinton is married to a WOMAN with children and im not sure about stacey|`|AdeD0xMuaa	I think Clinton is gay, so no.
0wyxSUvMaa	sounds<br>  <br>  Like She Do.<br>  <br>  Go Get Her.|`|b3BoOmojaa	yes|`|flMOqt4daa	I think it's natural for children to do things that feel 'good,' since their maturity in thinking is lacking. At your age, you're not able to decide life or death if you were in a hospital setting ( i think it's 16 in illinois or 15). The decision goes to the parents.<br>  <br>  So i have to say yes she likes the pleasure you're giving her but a possible no due to lack of developing in moral and thinking.
oYlX1rgMaa	im pretty sure that she is into you! if you like her more than a friend then you should take a chance and tell her. but you know at the rate you guys are going you might not need to tell her. either she will beat you to it or you guys might just both know. but yea thats just what i think. good luck though! hope everything works your for you!|`|45KusSDaaa	I think that you like her a lot. And she likes you too. From the looks of it, it seems like you both are to shy to admit it. Once you both admit your feelings to eachother, I am sure that you will start going out. When you two were fooling around, you can tell that she likes you, and that you both are interested in eachother. I think that you should just talk to her about it, and tell her how you feel.|`|0H9Y99Kwaa	well...you can't be sure until you ask...i know that it is really awkward to tell someone you like them but when a guy tells me that they like me i respect them for being straight forward and if i like them we go from there....you should talk to her.<br>  <br>  If she lets you put your arm around her this is a big indicator she may actually like you. :)|`|FrzCscBlaa	i think she really likes you as a friend, but if she really wants you then she'll do something first but hey i think you have a really good thing going here and my advice is not to get serious or anything cause it sounds like fun and you should stay this way for as long as possible.|`|xzmKhrmjaa	If she is a grade 9 student.. she already know what love is.. so maybe that girl have a crush on you or something like that.|`|jiWdMwYKaa	i think that there are two big possibilities here:<br>  1 she does like you in that way and she wants you to make the first move<br>  2 she just likes you as a friend and shes just really comfortable around you and doesnt think anything of it.<br>  i say you should go with your gut feeling if your gut is telling her to ask her out or to make a move then doit!!<br>  but if its telling you that she sreally not interested in you then you know the drill...<br>  hope i helped <br>  good luck|`|3v6PHIdJaa	Why won't you ask her friend to ask her that you didn't say does she like you <br>  and a friend can get the answer and tell you <br>  do you like her|`|3Fma3URSaa	if ur laying on her she she doesnt mind then she must be a little into u
LCAzlHhEaa	The "to" should be larger than your sending address.  If you decide to use color use the brown or latte, because the pink would be hard for the postman to read.  Or you could do black but I would stay away from pink.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Black or dark brown and yes font bigger for addresses|`|NB4h4jTyaa	You should be using as dark ink as possible on a wedding invite envelope. The invitation itself can be whatever you want, but the post office scanners need to be able to read the mail easily.
uiGx0rPVaa	here are my opinions<br>  1. He's confused<br>  2. he's lazy<br>  3. He just needs some space :)
pC5SWxC3aa	Get into knitting and quick.|`|T02BJJGjaa	Tell her you have a dinner date and you wish she would have still gone on her retreat.   That way she knows your a liar and a cheater and she can file for divorce and get out.|`|2bhMmlzHaa	Make it a brunch date that way you can have both.|`|hEU4SlhTaa	LOL "knitting retreat"??? is that what we are calling it now. Seriously, hire a private investigator dude.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	thats your own damn fault.  why would you ever want her around?|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!<br>  <br>  I start his car and pack his bags when my husband wants to go somewhere....<br>  <br>  Arrange a girls night for her... on the other side of town of course.... and tell her it's because you feel bad that you gave her crap.<br>  <br>  Good luck, oh and have fun with your girlfriend?|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	If you mean date as in "date with another woman" then you are a complete douche bag. If you don't want to be with just your wife, then it's time to end it. Though I don't think that she would take it too hard. Knitting Retreat?Come on dude, you really believe that crap? Time to go your separate ways. <br>  <br>  If you meant having a dinner date with a friend then all you have to do is tell her that you already made plans that night because you though she would be gone. Maybe invite her along?|`|xGshAiXOaa	If you had plans for the weekend, why did you give her a hard time about her 'knitting' (ahem..)?  You should have just let her go 'knit' her brains out and been left alone to attend your dinner date.  Open mouth, insert foot.  If you didn't want her to stay then you should have let her go.|`|p6QizgmRaa	Carry on with the dinner date. Your wife is boring. LOL|`|CWVBfaPwaa	Knitting retreat?? Please tell me you're not that gullible!|`|O5KOwhovaa	LOL<br>  <br>  A "knitting retreat?"<br>  <br>  Dude, she's cheating on you.<br>  <br>  Face it
rkoxkAPDaa	What's to look at when your face is pressed to someone else's?|`|wBSkGfxjaa	Do it both ways.  No easy answer.  I prefer to see while I am feeling the emotion, but close them sometimes, mostly when it is getting heavy and I may want him to do more, so I sort of pretend (eyes closed) that I don't feel his hand or fingers that may want to explore my boobs or when I want to press my hand into the guy's crotch.  Thind about it for yourself.|`|1HyxHtquaa	haha yes they should be<br>  gradually close your eyes whenn your leaning in<br>  don't worry once you get the first one down with you will feel more confident|`|fec45926288b620425810f2b27a75fd1aa	yea .. if you do it with your eyes open, that's just creepy
6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	Sounds like he was afraid that he was losing you... it's about "control" or "power" in relationships, I hate to admit this. It just seems there's never really an "equal" relationship...or at least it takes a long time to reach. But you guys have been dating a long time...do you always fight? If this is the first time he's acted this way, I think that maybe there's something more to this story. Sounds like he was very upset...   My guess is you guys will get back together pretty soon.  If not, then you will figure out how to stay busy so you dont think about him constantly. You will realize whether you really want to be with him or not as you spend more time w/o him.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	he sounds kinda violent....well i recently broke up with my ex too and ive been trying to focus more on making good grades in college hangng out with my friends and stuff but honestly sometimes i really do miss him...it sucks because i still do miss him.....<br>  <br>  CAn you please answer my question ( has to do with why i broke up with my ex....he did me wrong but idk what to do...)<br>  <br>  go to my profile its under my questions and its the first onr that says <br>  <br>  : help!!!! need advice...."<br>  <br>  i would gladly appreciate it if you answered it <br>  <br>  thanx :)|`|BbT3DCHvaa	Keep yourself busy. Answer questions on Yahoo, go out with friends and family, take up a new hobby or spend time on your favorite hobby. Time is going to be the only thing that will truly help. In the mean time stay busy. Good luck!|`|3qSQ7hPnaa	lol my ex wants me back .........opposite day hu.|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	wait, please explain to me why he did all that? You were on the phone, why did he tell you to 'go home' and how could you not, NOT go home, weren't you home on the phone?<br>  <br>  Either way, to get over him; let your emotions out now, otherwise they will bunch up in a sense and come bursting out later on down the track or it could lead to other things such as depression (if it becomes extremely bad)<br>  Once you've had enough of crying and what not, a change always makes people feel better, girls generally colour or cut their hair for this. You could try new courses and take up all the opportunities that come your way, so that you can meet new people.<br>  Eventually time will heal you, I know it can be tough, but you will eventually get over him. He only broke up with you today, so its going to feel the worst.<br>  Go and see your friend you hadn't seen in 4years, that will be nice:)|`|SJisSKUqaa	Forget him this guy is a jerk trust me you will find somebody better.|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	Shouldnt be too hard to get over an a**hole like that.  You should go out with me.  Id respect ya;)|`|SZvJVM2yaa	MOVE ON TIME WILL HEAL YOUR PAIN !!!|`|mCoipTkbaa	damn that sucks, im sorry about that:(|`|DoKXlLL3aa	Wow what a jerk. Hun, you deserve a lot better. Hang with your girls and do stuff fun :)|`|m2eHPeciaa	well, it looks like he doesn't want u in his life anymore. the best thing to do is either:<br>  <br>  -move on<br>  -give him time|`|lUWY9r7saa	damn that sukks.....but you should eat ice cream with ur girlfriends and watch funny movies.....but not too much ice cream|`|ec96ef17862cbaba494090b53f646898aa	Stay away from this guy.<br>  <br>  Other acts of jealousy might have been apparent before this situation and it's very unhealthy. A guy who tries to control who you see is insecure about himself. <br>  <br>  He is generally just afraid of losing you (jealous) and is selfish. He is selfish in the sense that he will push you away before you have a chance to hurt him. Therefore you will be pushed out of his life before you even get that opportunity. Jealousy literally means "afraid to lose." Ex: A jealous boyfriend, a jealous mother, a jealous friend, etc.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: He needs to mature. And don't be afraid, because you're not the one at a lost here, he is. You can definitely find a wonderful man who isn't jealous to this extent. (A small amount of jealous isn't always a bad thing though! Keeps the fire going!) But this extent seems just ridiculous. <br>  <br>  If you want him in your life still, just wait awhile.<br>  If not, tell yourself you deserve better than an impulsive turkey! and keep truckin'!<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  Listening|`|bdrGzlhfaa	woww, first of all that guy sounds like a REAL jerk... or it could be that he's really hurt, nonetheless he has some issues. anyway, uhm you do not want someone like that in your life. What kind of a "boyfriend" dumps their girlfriend of a year & 5mths over the phone because of jealousy? that's stupid. you should be glad he's out of your life.<br>  <br>  & What to do now?... Enjoy thee single life. :) Go out OR stay in (whatever tickles your pickle) & just have fuun! :)<br>  don't let a dumbass get you down. Life goes on& Everything happens for a reason. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TyqGdBw1aa	he's insane if he thinks he can control you. it is your own will that you want to see a friend. if he can't accept that than he's crazy. don't start thinking that he only acts that way because he really likes you because that's not true. he's kinda creepy if he does stuff like that over such a little subject. drop him like a bad habit.|`|btgxidCUaa	that's scary..he sounds Really controlling and you should be happy that you're out of a relationship like that. just hang out with friends more. it will be super hard the first few days to get over him but you will eventually realize that you are better off without him|`|fec45926288b620425810f2b27a75fd1aa	It will definately be hard on you, but you gonna have to get over it eventually. Go out with your friends, meet some new people, and try to have fun. Maybe, if he starts to realize what he's missing out on he'll come back.|`|pvhQ69fdaa	In my country, if you give someone a teddy bear, you want to kill them.  Use that bastards testicles for fish bait...or food for yak|`|9mnofgFNaa	you need to relax and give it some time you arent going to get over him this quick|`|ks2oieV0aa	Wow, he sounds a bit possessive.  It will take Time to heal.  But you will get over it.  xox|`|YJBt7Ltpaa	get away from tht lunatic
lyPn7XB8aa	lol. this happened 2 my friend jt. sometimes it can;t get fixed and u can never have sex again. sux. but what happened was; the penis is made out of cartilage and has a vein going through it. if u were on top of him and ur *** landed on his penis and didn't go in ur *** or vagina. u may have snap the cartilage and severed the vein. u usualy have 2 have surgery when this happens. it depends on whether it was snapped all the way or not. either way he;s on having sex 4 a while|`|crZg76Hpaa	LMAO????? Is this serious? I've never heard of something like this. It's just cartilage. Maybe he was limp cause once it's hard I don't see how you can break it.<br>  <br>  Edit: I just googled it. N looked at some pictures. That is absolutely horrible. Poor guy. <br>  <br>  I read that it could be hitting the pelvis or some movements the woman makes. Just wikipedia it|`|pvhQ69fdaa	Your boyfriend is limpdick.  In my country, there is no hospitals, so you would have to get used to the ninety-degree. PS. You're a dirty liar.  In my country, we burn liars.  Or your boyfriend is limpdick liar.  Or you're just so  bad that he screams.  What? do you have barbed-wire in there??  Barbed wire...not good condom.
YMgm99gdaa	Sounds like you guys all need to go see a Family/Divorce Psychologist and work through this together.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I'm sorry, you are way too young to be dealing with all of that.<br>  <br>  You need to sit both of your parents down when it is calm. Even though it is hard to do, wihtout crying, yelling or being mean, you need to say this, "when you (dad) yell so much, it hurts me and scares me. You yell at me a lot when i wish you would just talk to me. I don't want to fight, but i don't know how else to tell you this."<br>  <br>  Trust me, it will work, I wish you a lot of luck.|`|fc9ecb5a900817a0bcf8f6fa3590baf3aa	Unfortunatly, it may not be possible to stop them from fighting/arguing.<br>  Your parents may need marriage counseling and you and your siblings may need counseling also to help deal with it. If your dad really wants to save the marriage, marriage counseling and anger management(for your parents) may be the way to go.Check with church groups to see if they can help with the counseling. And not to excuse the behavior, but adult relationships can be pretty complicated and fustrating. Not having enough money for the bills and things needed can add extra stress to the relationship. I know how difficult living with all the fighting can be. My stepfather loves to start fights just to have the fight then pretend that there is no reason why anyone should be mad(I tend to stay mad for a very long time). If theres someone you can talk to grandparent or other relative that can possibly give you some insight in how to deal with your dad and mom, it might help. <br>  For the drinking there is Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-non/alateen for the families/friends that deal with the alcoholic. I do not believe these groups cost anything to go to. That and a church group might be your best hope.|`|hLOYwnsUaa	Sorry about your troubles. But it seems like He's the one who is bi-polar. 8(|`|nnsuWIVYaa	Wow! you sounds like a sweetie person.  Iam very sorry that this is happening to you.<br>  <br>  Be strong and some day this will all be a memorie.<br>  <br>  stand up for your mom. tell you father how you feel.  have your brother do the same at the same time.  it may open his eyes.<br>  <br>  good luck...take care of you.
o5SHzFujaa	okee, well cheating is horrible. that is a fact it is disrespectul to the person, it shows you are a deceiving liar and do not respect or love the person enough to be honest. <br>  <br>  if i were being cheated on i would not put up with the lame exuses!!!!!! guys are really good at making up lame ****, and if they cheated obviously they are okay with lying so dont b fooled by the "oh baby it was a mistake" more than likely they arnt sorry, just sorry they got caught. end of story !!!!! i cannot stand when girrls just are like ohh well he was upset what he did hes sorry but i love him WHO CARES if they did that to u there is going to b a rough path. and obviously u can do better than a guy who will just b happy being with someone else. this goes for guys to. dont forgive. FORGET.|`|TNjKwlA9aa	I've never been in a cheating situation. But I would NOT forget OR forgive. The only thing I'd give him was a sock in the face and a kick in the nuts.

68edad4826bc75b2b9f39ed5a85d8cf5aa	At a Jewish wedding, you never stand for the bride.<br>  <br>  There are cultural differences.<br>  Just do what everyone else does.<br>  <br>  Don't try and make a statement. You may be wrong.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes you do stand when the bride enters. Typically the mother of the bride is the first to stand and everyone takes their cue from her. But if there is no MOB in attendance, anyone else in the front rows can do so. That is rude to sit the entire time that she walks in.|`|AA10526402	Yes, standing up is the right thing to do...I'm surprised no one stood!  You would think that at least the immediate family would have all stood, and then everyone else would follow suit.|`|7539ec184c5979d90293e53cc6ea20fcaa	Yes you are supposed to stand when the bridal party enters. Never seen anyone stay seated. Maybe the rules have changed.|`|ODYrypwaaa	Yes, you are supposed to stand.  It is respectful and traditional.  I think in a crowd people get scared to be the first one to stand.  So if someone doesn't make the first move no one will follow.  I can almost promise you if you are the first to stand everyone will follow ya.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I've never been to a wedding where they didn't stand up when the bride walked in.  That's pretty weird that the last two you've been to didn't do that.<br>  <br>  At my wedding, everyone will more or less be forced to stand up for me, as it's in a park with limited seating, LOL.|`|qSvOxfw1aa	Yes, you should stand up. Then the minister should make a motion for everyone to be seated. I went to a wedding once where the minister did not motion for us to be seated, so we stood for the first few minutes then people just gradually started sitting. It was a little awkward.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Yes, as soon as the bride appears you stand and face her.......as soon as she reaches the altar you turn and face the altar and remain standing until the officiate gives you the signal to sit...they will often say a prayer before you sit down.|`|AA11783671	yes, I think you are supposed to stand up and turn around to face the bride.  As she walks by, you turn and don't sit down until the pastor or judge tells you to.|`|St7Y2Ldkaa	Yes, you're supposed to stand and face the bride.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	If the mother of the bride stands up, then everyone else is supposed to.  If she doesn't stand then no one else does.  I've been to weddings where both things happened.  I don't really like it when people stand because then I can't see what's going on depending on where I am!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I believe everyone is supposed to stand up. That has been what happened at all the weddings I have been to. :)

YMgm99gdaa	No...God bless you, young lady.  There are some Americans who complain and what not about how their lives aren't good enough not knowing the struggles that people like yourself go through just to have the same opportunities that we do.

h7H1AWnjaa	It sounds like you have a lot going on within your marriage... Do you live with his family?<br>  <br>  Living with your spouses family can cause a lot of strain because most of the time the family has poor boundaries and will get into your business. You two are married and married couples have dissagreements and the fact that you are pregnant and emotional adds to the stress.<br>  <br>  He should NOT be telling his family about any fights the two of you have, whether or not you live in the same house as them, it sounds like your husband has poor boundaries in that area.<br>  <br>  As far as him lying to you, have you caught him lying to you before? You are right about the little lies adding up because in a way he is not respecting you and he is hiding something that he is doing wrong or that he may be embarassed about. Being married is hard and I know it is hard to find privacy and "me" time when you have a spouse and that is important but he needs to be honest with you about that and I am sure if the shoe were on the other foot and YOU needed the "me" time, telling him and being honest about it would alleviate a lot of stress and hurt feelings.<br>  <br>  Try not to stress out, it isn't good for you or the baby right now and let your husband know that now is not the time for lies, just be honest, I mean comon you are married, that is a HUGE step in itself and now a baby on the way.. wow!!!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|FormN1Owaa	You're overreacting.

RtkB46peaa	It's just tradition.  I told my wife it was her decision, and she changed it on her own accord.  She's mature, she's not insecure, she's strong, she's comfortable with her femininity, and she's not a neofeminist. Thank God.<br>  <br>  And let's be honest, if the guy takes the girls name, society in general would laugh him out of town.  Conversely, if the woman keeps her own name or hyphenates it, most people think badly of her, too.  Usually behind her back.  I guess the general populous doesn't see justification to change this tradition for no good reason.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Really?  You've never heard people bash women who kept their name?   Or especially the hyphenating.  I hear it periodically.  I can honestly say that I couldn't care less what other women do, but an aweful lot of people do.  I'm really surprised you haven't heard of this.|`|32QCv0l1aa	This is such an interesting question to me because as much as I love the idea of being "a part of" my future husband and our union sort of thing (not his property, don't get me wrong!, but something like being one with my husband), I still don't feel like I can say ok to changing my last name! =S It's really weird and I didn't actually think about it until now, that's y it's so interesting to me! It's probably because I'm simply not at the age of getting married, but I'm most likely going to make sure it's ok with my dad (lol!) before I decide to change it, just because it's his last name lol, but I don't think I would ever change it on my own if it wasn't tradition....? <br>  <br>  To answer your question though, the girl usually changes her last name because it's simply ceremonial tradition!!!! It's not to offend the woman and her freedom/independence or her family or anything, it's just to indicate that the woman left her natal/original family to be with the man who'll be her husband and the father of their children!!! That's it! It's a ceremonial tradition!!! The guy doesn't change his name because he's sort of considered the head of their family, I'm guessing, I'm not actually sure. Again, that's NOT to say that the woman is insignificant, because it was always known that she definitely IS, but traditionally the guy is sort of the "leader".... <br>  <br>  Bottom line is, it's tradition, if you don't like it, then don't do it! Not everyone does it, but I don't see why you wouldn't do it, really, unless your father doesn't want you to do it!? And the kids 98% of the time take their father's last name, I only know one family that has their mother's last name, and I actually don't see the point of it. But you can also do THAT if you have a problem with your kids having their dad's last name! Just as long as you BOTH agree to it because then, there'll obviously come some problems and you'll both wish you never got married and had kids in the first place!!!! <br>  <br>  So yeah. Hope my answer helped you out.|`|xCifmFfkaa	I'm a woman but I'm going to interject anyway:<br>  <br>  I see my bf as a product of his family. His surname, therefore, is handed down to him, it is not 'his.'<br>  <br>  If I were to marry the bf I have now--and I have thought about this-- I would NOT take his surname. But it's no disrespect to HIM or because I've got some feminist hang-ups-- it's because I would want in no way to be associated with his family, whom I wholeheartedly cannot stand, and don't like either (and believe me I've tried; after six years it just ain't happenin'). His family are users and useless, and he's come so far from that.<br>  <br>  So basically, to me it'd be a rejection of his family, not him. If I wanted to reject him I wouldn't at that point be wearing his ring...|`|0lwGsRNqaa	Well i'd want my wife to take my last name. It  keeps your family legacy going. Women have a choice, but most men I know would dump a girl if she wanted to keep her own name. If you don't want to take his name don't get married.|`|D4rXVLMuaa	Who cares one way or another?

hl4kkvXhaa	OK...let me say, you might have made a compelling argument here, had you taken the time to proof yourself.  There are too many spelling and grammar mistakes for me to take what you have to say all that seriously.  Part of me wonders if you are just an angry, bitter soul who is trying to argue their way out of being human.<br>  <br>  But, I do agree that we don't actually need love, but it is nice to have someone to depend on...someone to talk to, or a shoulder to cry on when we need it.  I never plan to get married or even be in a serious relationship again but that is just me.  It's not my place to judge other people's choices.<br>  <br>  And, by the way, the feeling of being incomplete without a partner in life is actually not necessarily natural.  For me, I hate the feeling, and realize that on my part, it's because I was raised hearing those stupid fairy tales where the prince or knight always rushes in at the last moment to save the day.  Girls are conditioned to believe we aren't strong enough to go it alone.  We're conditioned to believe we're failures if we're not married with kids early in life.  Boys are trained to believe that they won't be a man until they have a woman to protect.<br>  <br>  It takes a lot to break free of all the conditioning and training.  Some of us are lucky enough to have been raised to see the silliness of it all.  In my household, I am the breadwinner, billpayer, and errand runner.  I take care of myself, and I take care of my daughter.  I try not to tell her my opinion on love and sex...but at the same time, I try to instill in her the realization that we shouldn't find fault within ourselves just because we don't have a compatible connection.  If she falls in love, great.  If she prefers solitude, that's great too.  <br>  <br>  Loneliness sucks, but basically there are some of us who know that it is better to be lonely than to be miserably "in love" with a disappointment.|`|flMOqt4daa	Well that's just one point of view among all the millions. Don't flatter yourself with your knowledge on the sciences and philosophy. Let society be.|`|TGhwhzhgaa	People have hormones, dipsh*t.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	i hear you, son. although i am not interested in marriage or having children........i still long to find a mate. but not just anyone. i am not going to settle for the first polar bear that comes waddling down the street.<br>  <br>  it sucks being alone. however it sucks even more to be with someone who makes you miserable.
LQISGYbEaa	Exactly how sure are you that you want to keep it?<br>  Keep in mind that your husband has probably touched every single surface in it, and you might need a Hazmat team to come in. Could be expensive.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Don't listen to him, listen to your lawyer. Don't do anything. Let him have to do all the work if it's so important to him. He's just trying to manipulate you and scare you into doing something stupid.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	It is entirely possible for you to keep the house as long as you agree to buy him out for his share of the equity. My recently divorced friend did just this because she needed the house for herself and their daughter. <br>  <br>  Talk to the bank who is holding your mortgage. They will instruct you on what you need to do.|`|YMgm99gdaa	You must live in the South to be using "Fixing to...".|`|bd8hQh8Baa	you must split everything <br>  so if he does not agree to let you buy his portion of the equity <br>  ( this is the value you have in the house subtracting the mortgage amount)<br>  <br>  then you will have to sell and split what is left .<br>  you will need legal advice , but only use it as needed as it is very expensive.|`|27b7cbeab3efac60aa8a9ba921dc0a33aa	What your soon-to-be ex is saying has a ring of truth to it.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, divorce is a negotiation, nothing more.  If one party wants to walk away from the marriage with nothing and give it to the other person, there is nothing illegal about that, as long as both sides are in agreement.  Chances are, the legal system will not intervene unless you and your STBX can not come to an agreement about the assets of the marriage.<br>  <br>  So the question is will you have to buy him out?<br>  <br>  That is between you and him, but it sounds like he has the upper hand big time.  You want the house really bad.  That immediately puts you at a disadvantage (Rule #1 of negotiation, always be prepared to walk away.  As soon as you "have" to have something, you lost).  All your husband has to do is keep saying he wants to be bought out of the house and reject any other offers you make.  Eventually, the case will go to the judge and as the house is a marital asset, the judge will probably order the property be sold and the profits split (or you buy his half out).<br>  <br>  While I obviously have no idea where you live, buying him out might be a good idea.  Chances are, your home price has fallen with the rest of the home prices in America.  Your equity in the house is much less than it was 3 years ago.  If you feel you'll be at that house long enough for the housing market to rebound, it may be a good idea to buy your ex out now while home prices are in the gutter.  Get a current appraisel, make sure to point out all the defects and shortcomings of the home, and produce the current appraised value.<br>  <br>  So in short, if you want the house that bad, chances are your husband will use it against you to make him buy him out.  If it goes to the judge, the judge will probably side with your husband.  Unless you can give your husband something to make him back off, you're probably SOL.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	You can only keep the house if both parties agree that you can keep it. If he wants to fight you on it, the judge will give you two options. You pay him in full for half of the house and buy him out or you sell it and split the profits. The judge will side with your husband on this one since it is a shared property and both names are on it. The judge will simple tell you tough and go move in with your mother if it is so important for you to live near her.|`|LUhh9bSWaa	Not gonna happen in this crappy housing market and economy.  Good luck with that.
0ktcvglRaa	Just tell her that you've seen her around before, and ask her questions about herself such as what she does for fun!|`|MUDLsPpHaa	well you will if you talk to me:)<br>  haha and no i dont think so.<br>  <br>  sayyy that.<br>  copyy, and paste|`|OyEEyIpdaa	unless you actually say "hey waassssup" in real life you should just try acting like yourself.  Girls know when guys are being phony, so dont be and you might impress her.  Theres a start.  and tell her shes cute or something and go from there.  good luck|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	say. hey i dont know you, you dont know me and i was just wondering, what are your fav, things to do? like hobbies? friends? places to hang? make small talk. make it easy.

I'm the only son so that was pretty harsh.  I only dealt with part of it and then buried it away because I just focused on other things.  I didn't feel anything for a long time.  Then it started coming back up and I had to address it.  Because I had buried those feelings for so long, something that I could've addressed some time ago was now a festering acidic ball of emotion that included malice and anger.  <br>  <br>  I think you're not letting it show because you're the oldest and you're trying to be 'the rock' for your younger siblings. That's pretty admirable but you can't take it all on your shoulders.  I think you will need to bleed off some of that emotion you're piling inside.  Right now you're doing the needful to get through the storm.  <br>  I really hope that helps.|`|4K2Qsjt9aa	Dear one, <br>  <br>  Nothing is crumbling down around you. ofcourse, parents are essential to one's life. but you are a lucky one to have no anger, no blame etc. you wont live with baggages. <br>  <br>  your parents are a  miserable lot. they are not even dumping each other its just that they cannot live together. <br>  <br>  I am an indian having a love marriage. At times, i think of separation and divorce in my fits of anger. i shout and howl at my children. this is so normal. if you are angry you would take it out on people around you. but my son would just hug me and say, cool down. thats enough for me.|`|skSzDIlwaa	well sweetie i had the same thing. they did it 2 years ago. i was fine with it no emotion ethier and i was the oldest so they told me everything and i was like the owl to speak for them. but i still have no emotion for it because i knew my father was an a**whole to the family and to my mom. then when they did get the divorce my youger brother and my father always fought and i would have to step in and stop. then my brother left to go with my mom. then he fought with me. so i left. so wat i can say is my father was always blaming someone for his problem and his famiyl was tired of it and we didnt have emotions for it cause we knew he didn't care that much anymore. well i hope that helped.|`|aCMkyR3saa	i used to think my dad not being around didn't phase me but now that im older im hurt maybe that's the way your coping with the situation and later on in life it will hit you<br>  <br>  hopefully it doesnt because its a real ***** dealing with some thing you thought didnt affect you  then your like wtf|`|meroRGRgaa	well... i have a similar but very different situation. i had a little boy who passed away 16 hours after he was born.. and for a long time i didnt feel anything. i went to counseling for it because i was concerned that i did not mourn my sons death AT ALL... what we came up with was that i just blocked it out of my mind and tried to continue with every day life as if nothing happened because it was so traumatic- i know your situation isnt the same as mine but have your parents (the two people who you have known and loved your entire life) leave eachother is a pretty big deal so maybe that could be it. im sorry to hear about your situation and i hope the best for you
MVnGhbi1aa	No. Of course not.<br>  <br>  If I act like I'm eating a cheeseburger, will I eventually not be hungry?<br>  <br>  No. Of course not. I need to actually go out and get a real cheeseburger. You will stop caring when you stop caring. That's the beautifully flawed way the human heart works. I wouldn't want it any other way.<br>  <br>  Caring means you have the capacity for love. Being cared for means someone appreciates that.|`|MfSeNwCWaa	Acting like you don't care, if you fake it right, will make it seem to the other person.. that.. well.. you don't care. Usually it doesn't make you not care anymore because you're playing this act for the other person in the first place........<br>  <br>  God that was confusing. But it makes sense when I first typed it. Sorry (:|`|AA11198190	That depends on who you are doing this to.<br>  lf it is someone that you really care deeply about....then you may end up the loser.|`|Sixq7h2Vaa	No.
JUSQ4b9Vaa	send em round to me man, i'm hung like a hamster !|`|A9sLvVDxaa	Well first, umm, we need to see pictures. That is very important. Yes.<br>  <br>  Next, hung guys need a lil control. Some women like big hung beef steaks and can take the whole enchilada, but unless you have a romantic bond, then it's just sex. Maybe you can train yourself to insert only a few inches? If the woman you're with loves you, she could practice with a dildo, and I'm serious about that, no joke, it could help her to take more of you inside.<br>  <br>  But there are lots of other things you can do to make sex pleasurable, it's not just the in/out part, there are lots more things. Get a couples sex book, one with pictures, or get a video.<br>  <br>  If you're ever curious though, there are a lot of men who would beg you to have sex with them and pay you lots of money! ;)|`|VtToRnykaa	13 inch internet penis = 4 inch penis in real life.|`|aLKXnw5Haa	you know if you pinch yourself. you can wake up and not worry about the surgery anymore|`|NPMKqJlMaa	hahahaha stupid lie man...|`|PLtU5AuYaa	Have you wvere heard of a condition called macrophallus?

GU1i931Xaa	My mum more so than my dad. Most of the time I get on ok with my dad, but we're too similar and he's a filthy hypocrite. And my mum is nice but knows she's nice, so whenever we have a difference of opinion, she thinks it's a personal attack on her and bursts into floods of tears, runs to my dad and WWIII breaks out. <br>  <br>  He thinks she's a saint and it pisses me off.|`|8dhe15MUaa	yes i do now i 48year old but when i was young i did not|`|POHWTDPRaa	Not at all.|`|Wv592rOqaa	Unfortunately, no one gets to pick their parents.  I love both of mine and have respect for them as well.  <br>  <br>  I do not judge those that think otherwise, because respect is something that is earned not bought or should be expected just because.  <br>  <br>  Someone once wrote the worst thing that could ever happen to a child is their parents.  I believe it is better to have 1 good parent or caretaker then 2 rotten ones.  I also think it is still best to not have or keep children if you are going to treat them badly and damage them for life.|`|oDz0FQpEaa	I didn't get along particularly well with them while I was a teenager but since I've gone to uni our relationship is just fine.

I will never be jealous of any of my kids.All she do is talk bad about me to my sibling and criticize me and embarrass me in front of people.She have even talked about me and said some mean thing about me to my own kids now i know it's time to let go b/c now she is trying to turn my kids against me which i have tried to rise them better and teach them right from wrong and this is so wrong what my mom is doing to me.I made up in my mind that in order for me to have peace and happiness i have to let go of the negative people and move on with my life. Mother r not people will try to bring u down if u let them.I love my mom but i don't need to be around her to love her. God know my heart and he see's everything so i won't have any regrets if i never speak to her again As hard as it is, this is something that i have been dealing with for well over 10+ years.I shouldn't have to go through this in my older years. I'm going to live life and enjoy it.|`|jzazkrAQaa	I don't like my mum because every single little thing about her drives me insane and I don't want to turn out to be anything like her. Plus when I was having problems with depression she refused to listen to me (what a mum).<br>  My dad I like more because he doesn't put as much pressure on me as my mum does and I can have fun with him. I don't see him that much so I can't tell him the thinks I want to tell him. The main thing is that I do love him but he is a classic grumpy old man: racist, sexist and all that lot and, unfortunately for me: homophobic (can't wait to tell him about that).|`|IUMzs9Kgaa	I get along surprisingly well with my mother, just not my father.~|`|4LLGenzBaa	yes they are nice people

It wears it down, then your teeth hurt!<br>  <br>  Try carrying a nail clipper and file with you everywhere so you will have the right tools when you catch that snaggle nail. And if you catch yourself with nails in your teeth, just remove it, take a deep breath, take another and another. Assess the situation and think about what you can do to make the stress smaller. Don't allow this to upset you. Just calmly deal with it. You'll see that you're grown up and can make good choices. Be nice to yourself, it's hard to break old habits.

Well before you decide to move with him think about medical, trust, and all the reasons the relationship ended to start with. If he's in the military he's probably gone on tours now and then who knows what a guy like him will do, I don't think he has changed i mean to meet a girl at a hotel while waiting for you..yeah i dont care but any guy smart enough would not have gotten into that situation at all. you deserve better and there is always someone else out there who will love you and your kids.<br>  Trust is really inportant in a relationship its also hard to get back once its been abused you dont want the kids growing up in a choatic situation or with arguing all the time!

9BbV2xqIaa	you're a sophomore...in high school?!<br>  I'm in university and have never dated anyone. you don't need to date to be happy. just find yourself first, then find other people who fit your ideals of yourself. then you will know if you really like him, etc. and hopefully by then the guy you like will also find himself, and then you can be 2 self-realized people together.<br>  that's happiness, I'm convinced of it. searching out other people to support you when you don't even know yourself yet is just artificial happiness.<br>  well regardless, good luck with this whole thing. hope it works out for you.|`|llez7aU4aa	Wow, you are thinking about it way too much.

U should really stop saying that ur ugly and think good things about ur self.|`|rcx668lgaa	Blah, blah ,blah  you should just blog instead of ask at answers...btw linking your question in the answer to another question is rude and quite annoying.|`|LgGeTaBLaa	Damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn<br>  wtf stop talking so much!!|`|ziw77iuPaa	Too Long to read... Submit another shorter one|`|Q4lzLhIvaa	"Last year towards the end of the year he told me that he liked me and always had".<br>  <br>  This was ur chance to ask him out<br>  <br>   "And i said that i would never offer him drugs and he said no and he continued with how he didn't want to hurt my feelings".<br>  <br>  I think every 1 knows wats going on here, he knows u like him and he is to afraid to tell u he has a gf already and he  does not want his gf 2 c u with him or else he is afraid of his m8s teasing him if they seen him with u<br>  <br>  hope this helped|`|s2DzUnhFaa	well... i think he likes u cuz he wouldn't keep talkin to u if he wasnt interested.no its not bad to ask questions about him cuz u guys r friends and that is what friends do...|`|DsszxGT6aa	If you don't tell him how you feel, you will never know how he feels. Talk to him but, say if not can we stay friends and maybe eventually  he will see something in you too.|`|Z5Be7ciEaa	im not reading thathow long did it take u to write it so heres an answer 4 watevr FRIED CHICKEN get a life and use shorter words and rite liss|`|dBHbmPJXaa	Whoa! calm it down girl! just tell the guy you like him already!!!! If he doesn't, well there's plenty of fish in the sea...|`|2VFEsJoUaa	You are still young and just got into sophomore year.  I think that this guy does like you.. He does give you alot of attention and guys wouldnt do that if they were not into you.  You need to have more confindence.. you are not ugly.. believe in yourself.. How can you make people think that you are not ugly, when you think that yourself. <br>  <br>  He treated that way on Monday because he is confused. I also think that he is jealous because you are talking to other guys. He doesnt know how you feel about him and he doesnt want to look like a idiot. I wish you the best. =D but itz only sophmore year. enjoy the rest of High School.|`|IVgiYmPpaa	Overall you like a guy. Just tell him you like him or you are going NO WHERE! Or he'll love someone else who confessed their love to this one guy and you'll be watching them love each other while you sit with your binoculars while eating leftover spaghetti in a plastic Glad container with a big huge heavy backpack on your back regretting that you never confessed that you like this guy! Who cares what he thinks when you tell him! Just do it!
m2eHPeciaa	YES!!!! 100% i don't have kids but the BF's i had cheated one me, hit me, never called me, its was horrible. n to be honest, they weren't even that hot. maybe its the attitude (confidence) that girls like in them. but im completely over it, n finally found a good guy :D but overall, i can say that they helped me learn. learning about relationship, and how to appreciate someone good.|`|fBGIUSfaaa	are you insulting me? you cant control who you love, yes im a single mum in my late 20s, when i met the father he wasnt a 'bad boy' but he did turn into one after nearly a decade, and especially after our child was born.. <br>  but yes it has altered my perception of all men, if you can be with someone and love them for that long and then they take off with your best friend just after you have given birth, how can you trust men?? <br>  As it stands i cant see any man out there good enough to love my child and i and be there for the both of us... im not sayin that all guys are bad im just sayin that i cant trust them anymore... hopefully this might change one day.<br>  <br>  However there are no regrets really because i have a beautiful son :)|`|wRHhpanmaa	NO i don't regret dating bad boys because it taught me how to appreciate a nice guy.<br>  <br>  and how to tell the difference between the two.|`|sA8w2znyaa	I am not a mother yet and I am in my early 20's. I must say I regret and don't regret dating bad boys because it made me smarter to finding the real thing--the good guy. Unfortunately, what I've learned is that there is a serious shortage of good guys and the reality of knowing that is what I regret. As good as some guys claim they are, they're only good to the one they love and they don't care who they hurt along the way. <br>  <br>  Bad boys are like "celebrities" with their 15 minutes of fame-- they might be hot at first, but it gets old real fast once people see who they really are. Trust me, if there were enough good men around women wouldn't whine--just that simple. I do still have hope that there's good men out there. Therefore, my perception hasn't been entirely altered, just broader. It's truly like picking a needle out of a haystack. In other words, it's easier to come across a bad guy than a good guy. You may disagree, but I base it on my own life, my family's lives, and my friend's lives. Everyone's life is different. Therefore, everyone's point-of-view will vary.|`|y2ZTzfWHaa	I'm in my early twenties and I'm married and an un-mother, but I have dated my fair share of bad boys, so I'll impart what wisdom I can.<br>  <br>  After I realized that, for all their appeal, bad boys are bad news, I started going after "weekend bad boys".  You know, guys with motorcycles or tattoos or other "bad boy" qualitys who were still kind hearted inside.  That's what worked out for me.|`|bsSEC6Ozaa	Dating a "bad boy" does change your mind about men in general. I will not go into details but after i dated a "bad boy" I lost a lot of things... Friends, family, material items and physical well being. I regret everything about that relationship.|`|w6DJj1a8aa	no it taught me how i want to be treated and the badboys i dated trully loved and cared about me!!!!|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	lol Nope I'm not single or a mother, but no I don't think I regret the "bad boy" experience.  Then again, they just cheated.  Nothing truly terrible happened (wasn't beaten, no STDs or baby mamas etc)  It teaches you a lot about life and about yourself.  It also teaches you to be thankful for those "nice boys" when they come around instead of writing them off as boring.  Besides, "bad boys" can be fun, until you see their ugly side.  Much like the "bitchy hot girl" stereotype guys seem to gravitate to and for some reason put up with until they can't take it anymore.
JDC02N8waa	The phone always changes people's voices slightly. If he likes you though, it doesn't mean he will necassarily call you. Sometimes guys are shy themselves too. At least, this happened just like it did to you and he told me he never had the guts to call afraid of rejection.<br>  <br>  Give it time. (:|`|5lm9D2zdaa	yeah. if he like's you . he would call you. you shouldn't have to make the first move.<br>  how do yo uknow he doesnt just tink of you as a friend? and that is why hes always talking to you and stuff.<br>  just look at his body language and ****; and try to figure it out.
ca2e4d7e984edc98fcf597c1809ed8c6aa	It's love, but it's temporary unless you two work to make the love last.  Chances are, he's not committed to being your mate for life, and you will fall in love with someone else.  Having sex with him will NOT make him fall in love with you or commit to you.  Only certain chemicals in his brain can make him fall in love with you.  To commit to you, he must believe that he needs you to be his happiest.<br>  <br>  Since you're both teens, your brains aren't mature yet.  Give yourself time to improve before you settle down.  You should focus on making yourself the type of person your ideal mate would commit to.  In a study of college undergrads, researchers found that the males seek these characteristics in a mate:<br>  <br>  Essential characteristics:<br>  --Mutual attraction and love.<br>  --Dependable character.<br>  --Emotional stability.<br>  <br>  Important characteristics:<br>  --Education and intelligence.<br>  --Good looks.<br>  --Ambition.<br>  <br>  Desirable characteristics:<br>  --Good financial prospect.<br>  --Good cook and housekeeper.<br>  <br>  Regarding "good looks," health & youthfulness is key to physical attractiveness.  Use sunscreen (don't suntan), sleep at the same times every night & get 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 hrs of sleep, eat plenty of fruits & veggies, drink plenty of fluids (w/out much sugar or caffeine), exercise daily, and practice good hygiene.|`|P5q72CJFaa	Don't believe that it's not possible to be in love at your age.  It is, but your definition of love, relationships, and what you need will change as you grow older.  Yes, you probably do love him.  Yes, right now, enjoy the feeling of being with him, (are you with him?  If not, tell him you like him.  Get the ball rolling.  Get to know him at least, that will give you even more of what you want to know... love vs. infatuation) The thing is, you might meet another guy in a month and have the same feeling.  You might meet another guy if (theoretically) you and Brendon date all the way through college and then you bump into a stranger on the street and suddenly your life view changes.  I believe different stages of our lives have different soulmates, all there to serve a purpose.  He might be the one to help you figure out love for the very first time and to take away valuable life lessons.  You will never know true love until you've known true pain, sadly, but it will make you love all the more.  Just go with your gut, trust your feelings, and enjoy it while you ARE young.  :D|`|I1obSjwbaa	I'm thirteen and i have a boyfriend... his name is julian. He's 14. As your Brendon, he is those special qualities. Enjoy the lust and love when it lasts. But don't do anything you'll regret, because no matter what, you will not be with him forever, even if you want ot be.|`|cA3U6GFgaa	Lol no honey it called infatuation..It just phaze that you are going through...At age 12 you dont know what you NEED in you life people will come and go dont be a naive girl and fall for every guy you see|`|4DyJE8uDaa	trust me, it's not love.<br>  <br>  you won't be with each other forever; you'll out grow each other.<br>  your tastes will change.<br>  <br>  but for now, you might need each other. live in the moment. <br>  you're young.|`|68opYVLcaa	no its not love, your 12 not saying you cant love someone, but your not in love with anyone.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	nope its not love<br>  <br>  your too young to know what love is<br>  what you are feeling is a crush|`|4tDTQOgNaa	No it's not love at all. You are just "infatuated" with the guy. Before you know it you will end up liking someone else. I know you may not want to hear it but it's the truth.|`|MVnGhbi1aa	It's the 12 year old version of love.<br>  <br>  Which is nice and difficult at the same time.<br>  <br>  But the 13, 14 15, and 16 year old love will be about the same, but not recognizable to you as you know it now.<br>  <br>  The 17,18,19, and 20 year old love will all be exactly the same as your 21-24 loves, but at 25, suddenly that love is completely different.<br>  <br>  It is still wonderful and difficult, but it will make you feel foolish about this 12 year old love.<br>  <br>  After 25, love continues to change and grow and you with it.<br>  <br>  At 35, my love is wonderful and difficult too, but it is nothing like your love now.<br>  <br>  Isn't it lovely about love?|`|eha1fN72aa	it is most likely lust. Which is you have very strong feelings for him but you are to young to know what love is. Take you time hun. Don't rush anything. You still have a lot of life ahead of you. I'm not saying this to put you down in any way..|`|mLsP2M0taa	WOW!! soo young :)) its cute that you like him but does he like you back? it might be love but its hard for someone your age to be deeply in love. Discover really how you truly feel.|`|Sixq7h2Vaa	yes its possible..and if you feel like that then good for you

( :
jiWdMwYKaa	well from my experience when ever a guy likes you he tends to do most of those things your talking about. i think that maybe he wants you to make the first move.i would say go for it or you could also wait it out more longer so you can be not sure but positive that he is into you in that way. and once you feel comfortable enough to make a move then go for it!!!<br>  good luck!|`|5ZjumuIeaa	I think you answered your question yourself. Your obviously more than a friend. Good luck with your relationship with your crush.|`|defeBgqdaa	it seems that you guys would be close friends, sounds like more of a  friend to me|`|rocymLqIaa	Yes he likes you! He is so totally flirting with you!|`|AA10325988	sure....I guess|`|vGTF7wf0aa	when he is flirting withe you pull him close and kiss him|`|uMZVKloSaa	Okay i got to be honest with you, i have a lot of experience with situations like this. It sounds like there is some strong flirting going on between you too, but that you are also really close. You don't want to just turn into friends with benefits, because then he will never think of you as more than just a "hook up" and a "flirt" which with in the long run hurt you if you want more than that. You should figure out if he's going to ask you out, or what. Obviously, you wouldn't ask him, so ask one of his friends or ask one of your friends to bring it up to him. Don't tell a bunch of people to ask because then he will panic and think you are too much fuss. Good luck :) and happy almost birthday.|`|19gXwmRqaa	from what you described...i would say yes<br>  <br>  maybe ask him...but if he says no dont be upset<br>  <br>  and if he says yes...congratulations<br>  <br>  also try see if he is lying or not, who knows, it could just be a set up|`|3Fma3URSaa	friends with benefits maybe? :p|`|ptActoJ7aa	yes. you are.|`|0wAZQdvyaa	lake boy shes a girl...<br>  * go get HIM tigress*<br>  :) really, go for it|`|cce9d5d3e1f6a8bafb5bad987d7a425baa	heckkk yeaaa!<br>  <br>  go get her tiger!|`|FmBuFsnfaa	may b he likes u so much...enjoy life..
fB8sgzshaa	Girls are like that, they can take things very offensive. the same thing happened to me before, she then started liking my best friend hwo then slowly turned wierd and by wierd I meen evil. in the end I told her that I still like her then let her go. That's what you should do. tell her how you feel then walk away. if she likes you she'll come running for you also apologise for what you did and keep your best friend away from her. good luck!
aiDV9FgGaa	Do you want to be treated like that indefinately if you were to start dating?|`|2G8lOPN8aa	I'm not sure what it is you like about this guy because he doesn't sound like he is really on the ball and he sounds quite full of himself.  <br>  <br>  I'd just be aloof back at him and not pursue him in any way shape or form.  The more distant you are to him the more he will have to go out of his way to indicate his interest.  He can't be cool to you if you avoid him for a few days.  If he asks why you have been avoiding him you could just be honest and say I got tired of trying to figure you out because you blow so hot and cold.  Just tell him that routine gets old pretty quickly and if he wants to have any form or relationship with you that he should know that you value consistency.<br>  <br>  Could he be bipolar do you think?<br>  <br>  FYI  it's "he's" not his.|`|tO8ey3o8aa	im not sure but i dont think you  should wait around for someone who is so indecisive|`|aY5vHbPLaa	He is a control freak. And most likely has treated others the same in the past. It makes him feel superior and in control of you. To him , he gets a kick out of watching you squirm and gets some sort of satisfaction from it.<br>  Seriously now, do you really need his BS? <br>  He does it to you because you let him. Kick his butt his insecure behind to the curb!  <br>  Good Luck|`|RZ4F43GZaa	well two options 1 u could just act hard to get- dont respond to him and then he might stop goin cold! or 2 bin him|`|fByUiSJ7aa	seems like he has growing up to do. If i were you I would act same way towards him. Not to play his game, but actually move on and ignore him. He probably thinks that he has you wrapped around his finger so he treats u how he wants to and thinks ull be there regardles!!! so stop doing all the favors for him, tell him that you are BUZY when he wants anything for you and just move on w ur life... if he realizes that he doesnt have you liek that anymore, maybe he will mature, if not, u got better things to fry!|`|Nrb9u9W0aa	he's cold to you maybe he notice you are nice to other guys when he's around you, so he's jealous maybe. I do that all the time to other guys.in magazines, they say guys do that to to make you think sometimes he is not so interest in you, so you can be all over him. but it seems he's the one who is totally into you. Just be patient, and watch how you act around other guys.|`|7HJ4kWB8aa	you need to get in control cos he is testing boundaries and trying to use you<br>  <br>  he might not realise he is doing it but you need to be firm and give him a bit of a cold shoulder<br>  show him you dont NEED him.. give him space for a bit<br>  if you find he gives you more attention, let him in slowly<br>  if he's still not giving clear signals he's too immature and not worth it and<br>  you'll find some better : )|`|eFoTrRm4aa	As a guy myself.<br>  I would suggest, you let your heart tell yourself.<br>  If you think you can stand him and be around him go for it.<br>  But if you can't then don't.<br>  <br>  If you say no, he may be upset but he will understand.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|ED4nlW4raa	You don't.  He sounds as though he is bi-polar.  Stay away from and let him become someone else's problem.|`|yS1EODoVaa	the guy probably has no balls to ask out anybody so just ask his *** out|`|wGCCMjVsaa	its easy, you don't write essays on here about it|`|etdZZZLhaa	well, first of all, don't expect anything from him. If he's warming up to you now, maybe he's just in the mood to have some fun with you. And if he's cold the next, then that means, he's not that into you.<br>  <br>  More often than not, guys who act like that likes to hang out with you as friends and not as someone he likes.<br>  <br>  Now if he ask a favor, don't always say yes. He might think that you're always available to all his requests and whims, which might lead to just using you as a "favor friend". <br>  <br>  How to deal with him? I think the best way to treat him now is a "just friends" relationship. This way, you don't expect something that you might not get. And, if he likes you, then definitely he'll make a move. If there's nothing concrete about him liking you after some time, then just move on..:)
4D335m8Qaa	Make him put a dollar in there next time.|`|1b4968638c1deed56c6296be9dbf1339aa	1. Accept that humans fart. It's part of life. Light a candle to burn off the smell.<br>  <br>  2. Your father could be allergic to certain foods. Ask him to try to avoid eating wheat (bread, pasta, crackers) and see what happens. Wheat is a big allergen for a lot of people and causes a lot of gas.<br>  <br>  3. Some men delight in their big poops and noisy/stinky farts. Not sure why, but it's something that's rather common. It does have a lot of honesty to it, after all there's a children's book called, "Everybody Poops" and we shouldn't be ashamed of our natural bodily functions.<br>  <br>  4. When your father is no longer with you, you'll remember the dumb jokes and horrible farting with love. The sooner you can laugh with your dad the more you will enjoy him while he's here.<br>  <br>  5. You can choose to feel any way you want to about anything in your life. Can you be a victim to your own choices?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|L1ob0kXnaa	Just tell him that it's really embarrassing how he farts all the time, and it stinks really bad.

Tell him that it really embarrasses you and that you wish you'd leave the room when he has to pass gas--particularly in front of a guest.  Then, after you've expressed yourself, do your best to ignore it.<br>  <br>  If you can frown at him and leave the room whenever it happens, but beyond that, don't pay him any attention.  It sounds like he might be getting some juvenile thrill out of the negative reactions he gets.  If you stop reacting, then he may stop trying to get a rise out of you.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you're going through this, and I sincerely hope your dad grows up.
ks2oieV0aa	Sounds like they are Jealous.  Do what makes you happy.  Maybe you like more then just his appearance.  Like how he treats you.  Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.

NO!!!<br>  besides you need to go with what you believe in. you guys are so young, when men stop growing they can become quite handsome as the years go by, everyone has an ugly duckling phase at one point or another in their life. <br>  if you like him, so what, he is good looking to you and that is all that matters. you won't have biotches fighting with you for him. and he will love you and only you. (if he finds out you do like him and actually date)<br>  friends come and go honey. i dated a not so good looking guy as a kid, and let me tell you my real friends would tell me that they were happy for me that i did not have to not have a date on valentines day or on friday nights . at times i was the only girl with a boyfriend because i really cared about the guy not the way he looked, or at least that was not my main concern. he has to have honesty, fidelity, confidence, and good manners. the will to want to make a better man of himself and want to provide for his girlfriend, or future family. (wife and kids)<br>  it is all in how you see him. because your "friends" just want to be cool, popular, in, hot, what ever your term liking is, that is how they want to be, and that is being fake. how can someone just "love" someone based on how they look? yeah it counts for something but it is not everything. looks fade, dentures, saggy skin and stretch marks will come would those girls like to be measured by the same stick when it is their turn to look ugly? there would be no people married past 30!  be happy , be yourself, and don't fall into peer pressure. i know it is hard, but it it you who will be with him and not them so who cares what they think or say. i support you and my hat is down for standing up to what you believe. there are not many people like us in the world. everyone just goes with the crowd. screw that ! i have a brain, and my own heart, and just because things are brand name or designer brands i am not just going to buy what ever crap! versace or not if i don't like it, i am not getting it.  you know? <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck girlie ^_^<br>  <br>  oh. p.s they are just hating on you. he is a good person and one day when he turns 30 he might have his own bussiness and who is going to want to be his girl then huh? <br>   my husband was the really smart type too, he was a nerd but he played football all his life so he had somewhat popularity, but he was not the most popular. calculus 4.0 and 3.0 and above is all we ever got. and look at us now! government people. mmmm hmm remember this honey. you are better off without friends like yours. i know it will be hard to deal with, but you need people that want you to be happy, not judge you for what you are . <br>  sounds like he is great boyfriend material, just make sure if you do date him, to not get addicted to playing. 2 hrs max a day if at all. anymore and that is an addiction to it. he might not drink or smoke, but that will become his drug if you let it.|`|TyqGdBw1aa	it's natural for girls to criticize guys... trust me i'm an expert at being criticized especially by women. you just have to let them know that you like him not only because of his looks. and if they can't like somebody just because of their physical appearance than they need to grow up. because even though no relationship can really exist without some physical attraction, a huge part of it is personality. if i see a beautiful girl and she turns out to be a ***** than i look the other way.|`|UZZHJsnmaa	well does he act weird you should write a bout the guy so we can think a bout the problem not a bout ur friends how am i going to know why everyine hates him if i dont even know anything a bout him u didn't say anything a bout him :s|`|nd6IgbFraa	Your guy friend proably is just jealous and he might like you.

JAruRfYqaa	Take it from someone who knows, shy chicks take a while to answer, especially to compliments. compliments are just not things that are given to people who are shy, so when one is actually said they don't know how to react. just be really sweet and don't get too jealous of this other guy that she walked with. there are reasons that people are shy, and a lot of them deal with trust issues. maybe she doesn't really know you, which is how it seems, and it is possible that she takes a while to get to know someone. maybe she feels really close to this one guy and wanted to tell him about you and the confrontation she had. be nice, and don't ever think you are ugly because that is all mental games that you play with yourself. it doesn't help anything, and i really doubt that you are.<br>  don't assume anything, and just keep going the way you are. if you keep doing what you are doing, she'll eventually catch on. and things will just... flow.|`|CEm8asvYaa	My guess is she is friends with the other guy and has gotten to know him and is now comfortable enough around him.  But I think because she smiled that it definitely means something.  She is shy and it will take some time for her to get comfortable around you.  Just start by talking to her a little bit, getting to know her. And make sure you are kind and still try to make eye contact.  When she can make eye contact with you it is definitely a sign that she is becoming more comfortable with you. All you gotta do is take it slow and work her into it.|`|AA12048821	you didnt scare her away..she's shy..and a little surprised too..she obviously does not think of herself as worthy of compliments and isnt used to receiving any...thats why when she did get one..she has no idea how to act...<br>  <br>  if you want her to walk with you to lunch you'll have to ask her specifically...if she's as shy as i think, there's no way she is going to invite herself to lunch on her own.<br>  <br>  as for whether you are ugly or not..beauty is in the eye of the beholder|`|I2OoEDczaa	i used to be extremely shy. i would talk to the people that i knew best and shy away from newcomers. i always had the fear of making myself look like a fool. hang around her as much as possible and give her the chance to get to know you. if she doesn't open up to after a couple of months then she is probably not interested.|`|P0RYeE8zaa	don't be so hard on yourself wat did u say to compliment her?<br>  i know shes probably shy but the guy she walked with might be her brother or something! you never know why don't you ask her why?<br>  i know thats hard but try it i learned all that outta a magazine!<br>  have a good day!|`|B8SG8Cwuaa	im shy, and when that happens its honestly just me trying not to sound like a tard. <br>  <br>  She probably didnt look at you because itll be harder for her to put sentences together.

Trust me, she's just scared.|`|595aPfhFaa	yea she seems really shy and the guy she was walking with was probably a really good friend of hers|`|Fp9QKY9Saa	wouldnt know your apperence but maybe she just doesnt know wat to say, that happened to me once with the guy i liked and then he just stopped trying keep trying to talk to her but dont try to hard|`|AIPJBq5Faa	yes, you're incredibly ugly<br>  you make kids cry and dogs bark|`|7Nlp17x6aa	She probably didnt know shes doing it. Dont worry, its not that ur ugly.|`|TjbqFWItaa	it all depends on what you told her. now women who are shy want to watch how they act with other men. they don't want to show any emotions at all even if it is hatred, or dislike. (not saying that is the case here at all , just using it as an example. lol) anyways,the other guy might be a guy that she already knows well and feels comfortable talking to because she knows him from long ago or some time now. just go up to her and ask her if she has a boyfriend, if you don't know this already, and if not tell her that you kinda would like to get to know her better if that would be ok with her, and if she tells you something listen to her cuz you are not making it clear on here what it is she said to you, so if you can't hear her, tell her "what was that ?" or "excuse me?" then she will say it more clear. that is as much as i can tell you. if she is not into you at all she would tell you wether she was a shy girl or not. shy girls don't like to hurt people's feelings. that is their thing to make sure does not happen not to you or them. if she is not interested in you she will just tell you something along the lines of ....no i don't have a boyfriend, or i am not allowed to date, or i have been hurt so i don't want to date right now, or you are a nice guy and all but i just don't connect with you or i am not into you that way, i just want to be friends. she can say any of these or others the thing to think about is if she says she just wants to be friends then do it. just be friends don't just stop talking to her altogether. even if she is interested in someone else at the moment, your chance might come and you won't have to ever wonder what if you would have kept talking to her. i mean if you still liked her down the road but you decided not to talk to her ever again because she turned you down, you would never know if she ever did at one point like you. right? so just be yourself, be nice to her, be her friend first then you can start dating. studies show that when you are friends first your relationship will last more than if you would have dated right away. trust me, i married my high school boyfriend, i know what i am talking about.|`|By1DJAUOaa	she's shy...very shy!!|`|lK3TXGBOaa	maybe shes not interested in you...or it could have been that maybe on whatever you complimented her she found it disrespectful?<br>   <br>  can you please answer my question <br>  <br>  go to my profile <br>  uner my questions tha first question that says <br>  " HELP!!!!....."<br>  <br>  please...i would gladly appreciate it..<br>  <br>  thanx|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	What did you say to her? It sounds like she's just shy. She might've walked with the other guy bec. they are friends and she's comfortable with him. She probably just got nervous around you hence why she did not make eye contact... but it's a good sign that she smiled, though. I'd say just keep befriending her but do it little by little. Show her that you are sincere and honest.|`|5ZozqETbaa	i am somebody who is afraid to make eye contact with others. probably she feels scared and insecure when u get close to her so she walked wif another guy to feel protected. and dun forget, they are maybe frens and she will feel more comfortable wif him. dun worry, i am sure she is not scared away by u.|`|0ktcvglRaa	You're not ugly! She probably just knows the other guy a lot better and is simply more comfortable talking to him since she's talked to him more often. But it sounds like she likes you; she was just taken aback by your compliment!|`|T8P2sXMGaa	I DO THAT ALL THE TIME LOL<br>  just treat her with respect and leave her alone..<br>  or approach her when shes clearly more comfortable<br>  <br>  trust me .. annoying her is unfair and disgusting|`|ptWHIVjZaa	Here are the possibilities:<br>  <br>  a)  She likes you, was nervous and didn't know how to respond, and walked off to lunch with her platonic friend with whom she knew how to speak.<br>  b)  She doesn't like you, didn't want to say anything outloud, and tailed a different guy whom she may or may not like<br>  c)  She isn't sure how she feels towards you and so walked off with somebody with whom she felt comfortable speaking<br>  d)  She likes you, but either didn't know you were also heading to lunch, she had to head to her locker or something first, or wasn't expecting that you wanted her to walk with you to lunch.<br>  <br>  And, out of curiosity, what question did you ask?  Because she might not have known how to respond, or she might have viewed it as the end of the conversation.|`|QIjmPzVCaa	no ur not ugly or weird or whatever...as long as you really aren't a freaky nerd...i would act the same way...when guys just say things like that to you in the hallway it catches you off guard and you don't know what to say...you don't want to look too happy because then it seems like ur in love with the guy but you don't want to be completely rude because then it seems like you hate them and when you don't know what to do you just kinda freeze and mumble until you can bolt away...she's probably thinking about whether or not u still like her or if u think she's a freak...just try talking to her without making her feel awkward...i hate it when it's awkward and i don't know what to say it's so embarrassing!|`|HWLZsrqZaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ar7B44uoLQ8P2FR72.mQpQ7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306131028AAveZ0h">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|iO4YHFavaa	She is probably very shy, i think i would do the same thing.|`|oIGuYhvbaa	shes shy and probably doesn't want to seem easy so modestly playing hard to get. keep going after her and making her feel special. give it some time. =)|`|CLbd1LfPaa	If you figure out women any time soon let me know.|`|8th9KY1haa	If you want advise on maters of the heart your age would help.|`|aFQBF6ZIaa	i don't think you scared her away. she might just be VERY,VERY SHY.
szVvf7Nkaa	If you are in an abusive relationship then you know it's time to end it. Or if you have to constantly work hard at making the relationship work then you know it's time to end it. If you want to be happy then you  have to be with someone that you can trust that respects and loves you. And if you don't have that then you don't have a healthy relationship and you may as well end it.  But I have a feeling that you already know that it's time for you to end your relationship.

He's not settled in yet, so a permanent or long term move is premature, but that don't mean you're apart forever. <br>      If the relationship can become a lifetime together, a little patience is NOT too much to ask. Neither is the trouble of traveling to see him.  If it's NOT at that serious stage between you? Moving on is best. distance don't work, and missing someone is a natural but temporary pain.
KSK22vHUaa	The fashion industry is controlled by gay men.  They want models who have no breasts or hips and look like skinny gay men.  That's why models are anorexic--trying to become skinny as skinny gay men.  And with the female contours, that's fairly difficult until you're just skin and bones.<br>  <br>  Why look like a model, or a gay man, when you can look like a woman?  Have some curves, a soft body?  There are plenty more men who prefer this type of woman--it's WOMANLY!<br>  <br>  Besides, you can screw your system up if you get too thin.  No more periods when you're too underweight.  Over a long period of time, that makes you infertile.  Besides, skinny skinny girls miscarry because they don't have the body to sustain a pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  Being a healthy sized woman is not a problem.  Don't live by fashion magazines and models.
Vd6GkblSaa	well at my school i really liked a guy and when he would make eye contact and i would get shy and look away with a huge smile on my face. maybe its just she likes you alot and when ever you look at her makes her happy and she smiles and shys away.
wUh8Nt0laa	one thing i told my boyfriend strait to his face was "never leave me alone in a crowded place." which means don't ignore me and act like my boyfriend. NO matter how crowded the room is, always keep your attention on me. That way I don't feel insecure and think all these other girls around me are better and I am. At this party you should have had her always at your side our you at her side. Introduce her to your friends and engage her into conversation. That is what i expect of my boyfriend therefor i can relate to yours. Yes apologize, but Next time tell her "i will NEVER leave you alone in a crowed room"|`|MNHSiWARaa	Just remember one thing. GIrls are like elephants, they never forget.|`|iKssVvyDaa	I think you guys are both wrong, you should apolgize to her saying something along the lines that i'm really sorry you mean more to me than anything i didn't think i hurt you because your such an indpendant person, tell her that you didn't mean anything you said and that you said that stuff because you were hurt when she accused you of flirting with other girls when the only girl you see is her. hope that helps

gSn2vQZXaa	He had to go to New York City on a business thing.<br>  So, he asked me to pick him up and come by myself to pick him up. I agreed, and I came about 20 minutes early and just waited. And, then when passengers started coming out from his flight I walked over and suddenly, everyone on the flight kept on coming out and giving me red roses. I mean like 300 passengers! And, when the roses kept on coming, and coming the people started crowding around me, but leaving a little space where more passengers. By this point there was a crowd of AT LEAST 700 people, and security was not scared at all, this also struck me as odd, but they didn't care. They were actually looking at me. Then finally when I had HUNDREDS of roses in my hands, my fiance-not my fiance at the time-walked out and gave me a single WHITE rose, and got down on one knee, pulled out a ring and said "Katie you are my life, you are my entire reason for being" and then asked me to marry him.<br>  <br>  Sooo sweet!<br>  They put it on ALL of the local news outlets across Connecticut! It was even on CNN as a little section! Can you believe how IMPOSSIBLY sweet that is???|`|LCAzlHhEaa	My husband and I started looking at rings around Christmas, then around Valentine's day he finally bought the ring.  We had been in the jewelry store so much to look at it the clerks knew us by name.  When he bought it we sent it off to be sized and the girls at the store were like sir it won't be back in time to give her for Valentine's Day and his answer was she's not getting it for V-Day.  So my graduation from college came and went in May & I thought he would propose the day of my graduation but no he didn't. <br>  <br>  My husband works for his dad in a construction business in addition to farming so on Friday night when he took me home he said that Saturday we would spend all day together.  Well by like 2 he still hadn't called me & I was so mad that he hadn't called or came to pick me up.  Then when he got to my house I was all cute in a khaki skirt & a nice shirt and he was like you're wearing that.  So that made me even more mad than I was because we were not spending the whole day together.  He went outside to try to ask my dad for permission to ask me to marry him & he said that my dad kept changing the subject so he just gave up on it.  When he came back in the house to get me I was in pj's firmly planted on the couch watching TV and said I was not going anywhere.  Childish I know,I finally got re-dressed in my cute clothes & we went to the house that we were in the process of purchasing together & he asked me to marry him in the front yard!<br>  <br>  Looking back now I can't believe I got all worked up because he didn't pick me up right when I thought he should be at my house.

I said Are you being serious you can't ask me to marry you over the phone. He said "Of course I'm serious, I just ask you to marry and you ask me if I'm the one who's serious . I love you and I know I want to be with you forever. So will you marry me? "I love you. Well if you put it that way how can I refuse. Yes. Yes I will marry you. One thing though just because I said yes doesn't mean your off the hook for a real proposal." I told him. "That's fine by me. Whatever me fiance a wants, my fiance gets." he said.<br>  <br>  Proposal #2: We were eating at a mexican restraint and he handed me two packets of hot sauce. "What are these for you know I don't eat hot sauce?" I said. Smiling he said "I know but will you please just read what they say. Hang on I dropped something on the floor, let me get it." As he did that I looked at the packets again. The words Will You Marry Me in big gold letters written on the packets. I hadn't realized he was on one knee looking up at me and smiling as he put his class ring on my finger. "I did promise you a real proposal didn't I? So if you'll do me the favor of marry me, I'll be the happiest guy that has ever lived." "Oh yes, of course I will. Um what do you mean by favor, honey?" I said. He kiss me and whispered in my ear "I seriously think I'm getting the better end of the deal."<br>  <br>  After that I instintly started kissing him and I didn't let go of him for 3 hours. After I stop kissing him, we just sayed in the booth huging each other. It was perfect.|`|sh0Cfcv1aa	My band was playing at a local bar on my birthday. the ongoing joke was that because I always wear his socks, thats what I was getting for my birthday...socks...well, he and my dad had gone fishing that day, and thay met me and my mom at the bar, gift bag full of socks and a dozen roses in hand. <br>      we had heard the song Johnny and June by heidi newfield and decided it was written about us, I had been singing it for a few months, and it was on the list for the 2nd set of the evening. <br>      I got through the 1st verse and chorus when the all the music except the violin faded out. I turned to look at my bass player to see what was going on and there stood Mark, my hubby to be at the mic. He told everybody to  keep dancing because the music would keep playing. He then got down on one knee and pulled out the ring. I just started crying and grabbed him. it was so sweet with that crying fiddle in the background!! then I had to finish singing the song and the entire show!! apparently he had asked my dad's blessing when they went fishing that day, and my dad had the ring in his pocket until he gave it to me.<br>      I lov him so much!

1jajRUK0aa	Well, talking to him 24/7 probably gave him the wrong impression. <br>  <br>  But if you want to maintain your friendship and be nice I say that you should tell him something like "I like being your friend and I don't want to do anything that might ruin that."<br>  <br>  Hopefully that helps. :)|`|tsOFwHv1aa	woah....thats a tough one.... if  i was to say that to a girl i liked and they didnt like me then i think the best response from them would something like, "im sorry (name)....but i dont feel the same way about you. I just want to be friends is all. Im sorry....."<br>  <br>  its suttle but its letting him know how you feel. Thats me personally, i kinda sensitive so thats how i would prefer it....but if you want to end the friendship too because itll weird you out than just dont answer and hell get the message that way and wont bother again.|`|eha1fN72aa	Tell him the truth.. Say you are friends and you want it to stay like that..
P5q72CJFaa	This is very normal from personal experience.  :(  I'm so sorry to hear about your problems.  I know how you feel, I hate my husband (separated now for about 6 months) but I still love him with all my heart.  What you really hate is the feelings that are coming with all of this, you probably hate what went down, but I'm sure you still love the memories and you still love him.  However, if there was something going on that you didnt like (he fooled you/used you) then seeing it from an outside point of view like this will help you make the right choice.  The best advice I can give you, because it worked for me, is just to live your life, ignore him, do what you have wanted to do.  Devote yourself to family, or your job, take up a hobby you never had time for, maybe even try to date a little, or at least go out.  You don't have to look for something serious, but a little fun will go a long way.  What will eventually happen (if he truly was in love with you, and if he was not using you) he will realize what is going on and how happy you are.  Perhaps he will initiate a way to work it out (but i would take it so slow) Don't do this just to bring him back.  And also, it might not work out that way, everyone is different.  After not talking or seeing my husband for 3 months, basically ignoring him, working hard, devoting myself to work and my son (yes, dating a little too) I answered a call of his out of the blue.  And yes, he wanted to work on us and realized what a mistake he had made.  Hopefully things will work out for you.  I hope that whatever comes to pass, you find happiness, be it by yourself, with him, or with someone else at some point.  Good luck!|`|GStTSYf4aa	I think a lot of the time you have to love someone to hate them.<br>  You may say "oh i hate her because she walks around glaring at me blah blah blah" but I don't think that that is actual hate.<br>  I think that it is normal to feel hate towards people you love.<br>  Good luck, I hope you feel better soon :(|`|5vbrHrzvaa	ya but you dont actually love him soooooo ya
vG4wTvYuaa	Yes. And it's a hard thing to do. Look at it this way... you're young, and based off what you've said it would be better for you both to move on instead of trying to stay together ... otherwise it may just turn into something that will whittle away until its gone, and feelings could get hurt in the process. This way, neither of you feel guilty if you should find someone thats here, versus pining for someone who is far away and feeling obligated to them in their absence.

oF6tsrhkaa	oh dear, sounds like you been missing alot of confidence and determination. 8 years you known her and you confess her on the day she had a boyfriend? you need to know how to be with a woman straight. For once, you have to know when to confess someone you really love. Waiting too long, then you miss the chance like you did now. Love cant last forever unless you make the decision that you want it last forever. Chase it before its too late. You need to be more in control and you must show her the real you. The real you that is been hiding of your feelings to her. Its that time when you need someone to care about and let it go. so you must chase her and in control and be with her.

If she was still trying to harm herself and would not seek psychiatric treatment for her behavior, then dump her as a girlfriend. You could still be friends.<br>  <br>  I know from experience that being with mentally disturbed people is extremely draining on your own mind and life.|`|1AZAmuvgaa	well no, but if something happened u would feel kinda guilty|`|dwhClJ1Haa	No. I'd try to help her if I truly liked her.|`|sM2aNguhaa	ehh been there done that, and it's yucky, cuz you want to kill "whoever", but you don't wanna go to jail<br>  <br>   and she usually has some reason why she won't go to the cops, or she did and they didn't believe her etc<br>  <br>  it feels yucky|`|CxVjw6XDaa	No.Id just care for her a hundred times more. Wouldnt leaving make everything worse?|`|NEkssyeAaa	I would still date her and help her in overcoming her fears and gain her confidence back. I would tell her be strong, dont be a quitter, be a fighter!!|`|cce9d5d3e1f6a8bafb5bad987d7a425baa	If i loved her enough, i would not stop dating her.|`|iZ5etrk3aa	y would i left her when she really had a difficult life...i would certainly helped her....|`|078bdda067d82a0dc6b47d9639e39c3faa	No!

She will put her trust in you and be your best friend. However if you betray that friendship it could end up in  a bad way.<br>  So think hard before you tell her that you are serious.|`|LCCVCHmWaa	No if i loved her I would try to help her through it and I'm assuming that your the one that was raped tell him, if he has a problem with it then hes not the right one for you.|`|xrEIAD2aaa	I myself have had both happen.  It doesn't mean anythings wrong with you.  I don't think that should be any reason to stop dating someone.  If they want to talk about then support them.  If not then enjoy your relationship.|`|MGPlYmkbaa	No I would not stop dating her. But its the sort of thing I expect her to disclose early on in the relationship to avoid any problems in future.|`|tSwCd5kvaa	Stop dating her!? That's just cruel! It's just like saying, I'd stop dating a girl because she wore a coat.

And is she getting help for both situations.|`|QKaI6Ftqaa	no, i would try to help her deal with her problems like a good boyfriend would do
nsmTjIgxaa	From my own experience, we girls don't orgasm that long. The most an orgasm will last for is about 10-20 seconds. So it's possible that she didn't orgasm and just was enjoying what you were doing to her. It takes a lot of effort, depending on the girl, to make us orgasm. If anything just ask her.|`|mWa8DNyEaa	is your name dillion if so add info to your question saying yes or no.  and if your name is dillion, yes she was faking.|`|uqwL9544aa	It's a lie, a myth.<br>  <br>  They only like it when they see a discount at Macys|`|0ZyHN4Taaa	Macy's is correct.|`|mCoipTkbaa	maybe she was having multiple orgasms.....girls can do that..<br>  they do last longer than a guys maybe the longest being 15 seconds..but she can have them back to back....<br>  <br>  hope this helps..:)
skSzDIlwaa	wow i do have to say your dad is an a**whole and should meet my dad.. well one your dad needs to know that his gf is not his whole freaking life you and his daughter's are and needs to know that you guys are hurting from this and don't really like the gf cause a good family means a good relationship. i am sorry for every thing you and your sister have to go threw. well try this why not have a family meeting before the gf gets there and all of you girl's tell him how you feel about the gf and wat you want and how you guys are hurting from this and see what happen and also if he tries to talk over you just keep pushing back so he knows you guys are getting upset and want to fix this. well good luck sweetie's|`|7CPRTQSTaa	All you can do if you already talked to him about it and he gets defensive is just leave him alone. I know it's hard to slowly let go of a father you want to be a certain way. I've been there and am going through it now, but you gotta do it because he will change when he's ready. If he truly loves you he will take notice and either change, or continue to do the same things.|`|AA11866897	No, the fact you recognize the need that therapy may help the situation isn't bad.  At varying times family therapy could help you over this situation. Talking to a single therapist for yourself will also help you sort out all the feelings before you try to talk to your Dad and a family therapist could help you and your Dad talk things through without the yelling or at least offer suggestions.<br>  <br>  As for him treating the girlfriend and her child better, I'm afraid until he sees this there isn't much to do but wait. As for the not cooking when she's not there, I don't know how old you are but you could try preparing little meals. Hotdogs aren't that hard as well as some regular meals.|`|hPVKMD4Iaa	I had the exact same problem once!  Where's your mom?<br>  If you can, ask him:<br>  Is she more important than me?<br>  What if I killed myself? (I did that, it helped.  I may seem sick minded, but it did make them think!)<br>  What if I ran away?<br>  What if I was on drugs?<br>  What if I drank alcohol every night?<br>  What if I was a prostitute?<br>  Would you be mad if I'm not a virgin?<br>  <br>  Ask him questions that would make him concerned...<br>  Good luck, and my heart is out to you!

TjbqFWItaa	maybe she just wants to be a body builder type. she might have been influenced to grow up that way. or maybe she is just really fit and you are not. i would have to say that most women would like their men stronger than them because they always want to be the ones rescued and not the rescuers. you know what i mean? and also if she is thicker or heavier than you matters too. i mean bone density if she is big boned and you are small or if you are both slim but she just has more muscles, if that is the case than you need to step it up for any girlfriend that you might have in the future. you don't want to be the "damsel in distress" while your girl beats up the bad guys?(for you)<br>  just do 2-3 sets of 25 push ups a day, and keep doing your curls eventually you will be alright with your strength, you are probably really young too. so i would not trip on that . just keep trying and train your muscles hard, nothing like muscles to make a girl melt. but not too much like arnold s. the governor of california. that would be "nasty" muscular.<br>  don't worry though, you will be alright later on. look at it this way she likes you for you and that is all that matters. just keep working out more without her knowing you do and you will one day pass her. good luck !|`|NfIdKeJ8aa	i don't see the problem with that. if that's the reason you don't wanna get back together with her, that's a pretty crap reason. i no i would hate it if that's the reason a guy did that to me.. <br>  <br>  it wouldn't be weird. it depends on the guys strengths and weaknesses. i think you should give it a go cause no girl really cares if they are a bit stronger physically.|`|9a506c84f370dbf2fecea59b04578a36aa	i've always found it rather weird when girls decide to bulk up- esp when they are bulking up more than their guys are...i understand completely how you would find it weird because I have also.

JhvqUvlsaa	You're going to have to let this guy go. If this is how he's acting, then he's either confused right now about how you have feelings for him or he really is a jerk. So let him go. Concentrate on what's important; that will help you to get over him. Focus on school, your family, your true friends, and other priorities in your life.<br>  <br>  And speaking of true friends, the guy who made this petition for people to sign that had your crush's name on it is not a friend either. Don't spend as much time around him, especially when you are sad like this.  Focus on your good friends; the ones who are asking about you care about you. Hang out with them.<br>  <br>  And PLEASE stop cutting yourself; it's not healthy and it is a sign that you are emo; your friend who took your razor away is a true friend because they don't want you to end up bleeding to death! Take care of yourself and get help, please! =)<br>  <br>  Good luck; I know this is hard right now. I had painful breakups in school too. <3
JhvqUvlsaa	Well I don't know if you ruined it, but things certainly are different now that you crossed that line. Definitely want to play it by ear and see how things go; this was spontaneous and your judgement was impaired but now that both of you are sober, you realize that it might not have been the smartest thing to do.<br>  You're comfortable with this guy cuz he's your good friend but that doesnt' necessarily make it right that you did this together.<br>  <br>  So just keep being his friend and let the chips fall wehre they may.<br>  <br>  Good luck

I"m not saying tha the doesn't like u, i bet he rly does.. its just that both of u r inexperienced since it's ur first b/f and g/f....  and for wat u should think.... well think first of all that it's a good thing cuase he clearly has feelings for you, but don't take it too seriously because u both or still young and things can change... well good luck :)|`|aiZOZ2Dxaa	You can't be in love at age 14. Honestly you said yourself he is probably overly happy he has a girlfriend, and I'm sure you are just overly happy that you have a boyfriend. <br>  Maybe he meant it as he loves spending time with you and is really happy your dating, and you took it too strongly. Just let the relationship flow. I don't think your in love.|`|jJjfeylmaa	this happened with me and my first boyfriend too. i think that basically, when he says that he really just means that he loves ya, like a friend kind of love, except his special friend. someday those words will have a different meaning to you (maybe with him), its just all about the way you say them. someday when you are really IN love with someone and you say that, it will be in a "i love you and i want to be with you forever" kind of way. it just feels different, and he probably doesn't mean it like that at this stage. there really just isn't a good in between word for ppl to use. "i like you" sounds like nothing, and then it jumps right to "i love you"|`|xVKEVGUZaa	That you two are still children basically. I mean this is your first boyfriend, you barely know what you want in a relationship. I always thought I knew what I wanted when I got my first boyfriend at your age. But then our relationship went bad...which I had never experienced. I never knew anything about a bad relationship. So, yeah. That guy said he wanted to marry me and all that, which I didn't plan on. It's been about five or six years since then and I am still learning about love and myself. Especially if you are his first gf, he really doesn't know much either. The Love word is always thrown around so much, people don't mean to, but big crushes are often mistaken for love. So I think you should just relax and not think too strongly of the "love" word.  Especially, once more, if your think he is overly happy about having a girlfriend, because then he might say that to the last girl before you, that he liked?|`|UfYo8Lmlaa	You guys are young and life experience teaches you what love between a man and female is all about.  I bet he thinks he loves you but in 15 years you will both look back and know that it was puppy love, we all go through it.

Don't worry about it, and thank him when he says it, but don't say it back until you mean it.|`|ylZTCrSYaa	ah sorry, he doesn't.<br>  he might THINK he does or he might just be telling you what you want to hear. tell him it's okay if he doesn't love you. at this stage in the realtionship just liking each other alot is perfectly fine. don't rush things and definitely don't say 'i love you' if you don't mean it because you will regret it! good luck :)|`|41S75G5Eaa	love?  at 14?<br>  i seriously doubt that, he probably doesnt know what love is yet, maybe he just likes you|`|Dvawm8Ezaa	it's puppy love. he'll grow to realize it. he'll "love" others later on in life too :)|`|XKoVjG2kaa	ok well im 14 too ive had way too many bfs to count and ive only said i love you to maby like 3 or 4 and love is something preety strong and he may be rushing it a little to fast but if your his first gf i think he really does love you maby beacuse he knew some things about you already and yall are now going out and he has strong feelings already you shouldnt say it back until a couple more weeks because my friends have exprienced the time when there bfs say they them and they freak out and then next thing you know the guy brakes up with them because the girl didnt say it back and for a girl its harder but guys they normally want 1 thing from a girl and theyll say it just so the girl will have more intention in doing that just wait a while and see what happens weather he says it again or if he dosent .<br>  <br>  i would love to hear from you soon ... so if youd like plz contact me  at my email. <br>  <br>  hope this worked=]|`|ETV7yvNbaa	It is called infatuation. You could say puppy love, too. A lot of people think they are in love when they are 13-15, but they really are 95% of the time not. Love is a lot more powerful then people think. You may like each other a lot, but I think he just thought he loved you. I doubt he knows how strong love is. He didn't intentionally lie to you, it is just that is what a lot of couples say at that age just because that is part of what couples think they should do. Just remember to say I love you when you think you really mean it! Good luck to your relationship. =]]|`|xrEIAD2aaa	Sorry, but at 14 you don't know what true love is.  Try having a few kids, struggling to pay your bills and seeing each other everyday even when your not "at your best" If you can get through that stuff then maybe you know what love is.  I'm not saying this guy doesn't have feelings for you.  Both of you haven't lived enough to know what the struggles of love are. I remember being 14 and being in love and wanting to marry this guy.  I knew I would spend the rest of my life with him.   I don't even know where he is now!  Live your life.  You never know what, or who, tomorrow will bring.|`|oKhItq5Xaa	i got a better one for you. <br>  I talked to a guy, no lie, 3 hours.<br>  He then texted me saying that he loved me and that he couldn't live without me and that without me he had nothing to live for.<br>  <br>  creepy? yes.<br>  <br>  just tell him its to early tp be thinking like that.<br>  Because if it doesn't last, hell do it to the next girl, and she may hurt him more than if you.<br>  just try to be gentle about it.<br>  <br>  good luck ;D|`|yoqiYBasaa	I don't think he is lying, but I don't think it is love either. I think he just really likes you alot and is very amped to be your boyfriend and has no other words to express it in, or no other feelings to compare it to, so maybe he really thinks it is love. You both are very young, and love is different at 14 than it is at 15, 16, 17 and so on. Love changes with every new experience you have. I remember when I was 14 and thought I was in love, because I had never felt so strongly about someone, but it was just hormones. I think you should take it slow, because love is what happens over time just being together.|`|vZD0wKKdaa	Sounds like sweet young love to me!  You'll know for sure if it was love if you experience a crushing heartbreak when it's over...Until then though, just enjoy every wonderful second of it, and if you end up taking your love to the physical arena, take some condoms with you!|`|2p0zxxplaa	he probably does love you but i think he came on too strong. either that, or he doesn't love you and just wants to make out 24/7.<br>  no offense. i've gone out with a guy like that and he was this desperate, needy *** who hated it when i talked to other guys. sorry.|`|uIbWOUSyaa	umm hes infactuated hes never dated anyone so hes just in a thing called "puppy-love" which i like to call poopie-Sh*t. hes just new at the whole dating thing and he doesnt even know wat love feels like. its normal i guess for most people in their first relationship.<br>  i hope i helped|`|2AAHnPBnaa	Definately us 13-14 year olds don't know what love is, we see a girl, we date her, we love her.

There's no reason for you to be forced to feel awkward because your relationship ended, if he doesn't want to be friends with you, then it's his loss =) Just be friendly and hopefully he will loosen up too.

Just go for it!|`|v09X6trAaa	Maybe he realized that you won't make the first move and feels like you want him to do all of the work, so he's starting to feel less interested. That happens to a lot of guys. Makes them think that either the girl doesn't like them enough to make the first move or that she's the type of girls who expects him to just give everything to her without her having to do anything herself.<br>  <br>  Of course, it could just be that you're over-reacting. The next time that you see him, just give him a hug or when you're walking together, grab a hold of his hand. If he reacts strange and pulls away, then you know that he's not into you anymore.|`|46932e299a057eec247337f7bca2654baa	even though the public views the male as making the first moves... well somtimes, guys can get shy too... he might not know wat u like... and doesn't like guessing cause he might be afraid of offending u or something... idk.... i don't know how guy's minds think, but wat i do know is that they like straightforward answers... so if u want to hold his hand... go for it.... maybe start out when u 2 aren't in public and see his reaction. Then, give him a hug too.... y is that so bad? he is ur b/f isn't he? since when can't g/f's give their b/fs hugs? i say go for it... or i guess u could just talk to him and ask him... but actions speak louder than words :)|`|UfYo8Lmlaa	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....don't you guys get it???  #1 ingredient in a relationship...communication.<br>  <br>  ASK HIM..................|`|qTmuOJCwaa	the easiest way to his heart is a ******** and it is quite  tasty|`|KXd5gc0eaa	he prob has sweaty palms so hes afraid you wont like him.|`|8uMXFWgyaa	hes not interested|`|da1Vqmbqaa	hes too scared to make the first move u got to and if he still doresn't then break up|`|BvZvZaxzaa	I used to get embarrassed to hold hands and kiss in public but I got over it. Some guys are not affectionate at all, or just don't understand how important it might be to you. You should break the ice by offering him a hand massage with some lotion or massage oil. End the hand massage with a little hand holding and see what happens. If he pulls away after that you'll have to ask him why he doesn't want to do it but you might be pleasantly surprised. Most men have no problem being affectionate after a hand massage.|`|87mkq7Zoaa	ahh, hug him more!<br>  maybe you don't have to hold his hand first, but hugging isn't anything. like, you hug your friends all the time right?<br>  an just hint at him that you want to hold hands. <br>  if he seems awkward about it, he probably does have sweaty hands. its whatever though, because after you do it enough and get comfortable wih each other in a little while- it most likely won't be sweaty forever <br>  ^^trust me, i hella went through that lol.<br>  <br>  sounds like he's really shy, so you should really try to keep your relationship feeling like one- or it'l probably end because you feel to weird with eachother. that = :( no bueno|`|ETV7yvNbaa	He is probably just nervous. There is nothing wrong with a girl making the first move. There are two options that you have. Number one, you talk to him about it and ask him why he doesn't. Number two, make the first move and just grab his hand when you are walking close! About the hugging, just pull him into a hug when you guys see each other or are leaving each other. Good luck!!  =]]|`|XKoVjG2kaa	i think you should just take it slow and in like another week if he dosent hold you hand then you may just have to call him and talk about it private. just say lets talk about our relationship . also its better for a guy to make first move but at the same its ok if you do just say hey lets hold hands even though it may feel weird. ok well if hes not hugging you maby somethings bothering him ask him .....<br>  <br>  hope this helped =]|`|RhzpMiqIaa	Some people have issues with public displays of affection.

565df5fe4c276dc3f59d54d1b9259380aa	Jehovah's Witnesses. You have to understand that we do not marry/date outside of our religion because of what you just said. It isn't extreme, just different. What do you find extreme? Really, God's commandments are not burdensome (1 John 5:3). Does she like you? She probably already knows that she is not supposed to date you because of your religion. We do not celebrate holidays or any other festivities that are out of harmony with the BIble. <br>  <br>  She is going to be what you want and need in a girl because she does not do the bad things that the others do. Since you see the good fruitage in in her, my question is what about Jehovah's Witnesses do you not like?|`|lc2WYfeTaa	Don't do it..There's more than one fish in the sea!! If you do you will be sorry I find that people who date etc.. with different religions it usually doesn't work out unless one person gives up there religion|`|88Gt7gJraa	I don't specifically remember the verse, but two must walk in agreement.<br>  So unless she changes, don't date.|`|0JLGGShnaa	I was raised a Witness and plan to continue in the faith, but I just haven't been as devout as I should be since I've been in college. Anyway, I say go for it. My grandma told me it's "frowned upon" but you CAN marry whom you want, as long as they are not an athiest or muslim or jew (I think). All the guys I go for are usually not a witness, so it's ok. I like this one guy who is Catholic, but I think once he found out my religion, he didn't like me : ( eventho i'm still Christian. I'd say go for it!<br>  <br>  some of the commits "offend" me. We ALL really aren't that uptight about it, so it depends on the girl and how devout she is i guess. You wrote it right James!|`|v09X6trAaa	Translation: "I don't think that she'll have sex with me right away because of her convictions.

I read one of those Jehovah's Witness pamphlets (which I think is bull**** by the way) and it had an entire article about why people of their faith cannot date or marry outside of their faith.

AA10652010	I'm sorry to hear you feel so alone.<br>   I'm sure your not the bad guy. I don't know you're situation so I can't say anything for sure, but  If you think your mother and father don't like you , I'm thinking maybe that has you feeling like your a bad guy. Sometimes people just aren't very good parents and they make their children feel unwanted or even bad about themselves. It doesn't mean the child is bad or unlikeable but if their own parents making them feel unloved then it' s hard for them to feel good about themselves. <br>  In other words it's not your fault. It's hard making friends for anyone , and especially when you don't feel good about yourself. I would try to get someone to talk to. If you are able to get to a good therapist, or guidance counselor, a support group. You can find a support group  in your area by putting in search terms like "depression support" or "depression help" ,and then the state and county you live in.<br>  This link is for a place that provides links to self help groups centers across the US, that you can call in your state. They can then help you find a group in your area,that would best suite your needs. I think they even have international groups.<br>  <a href="http://www.mentalhelp.net/selfhelp/selfhelp.php?id=859#states" rel="nofollow">http://www.mentalhelp.net/selfhelp/selfh...</a><br>  It might be most helpful to join a real self help group where you can talk directly to people. It may ease your loneliness to have other people to talk to who understand .<br>  Or at least find one online. You can do a search for "loneliness forums", or "depression forums". "Depression support online: etc.  You can search in different terms and fine lots of them ..so you know you are not really alone because a lot of people are feeling the same way as you. And people feeling similar things are good at helping each other.<br>  YOu can try this one:<br>  <a href="http://www.healthcentral.com/depression/support-groups.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthcentral.com/depression/...</a><br>  they have a list of several groups,<br>  or<br>  <a href="http://www.depressionforums.org/forums/Living-Life-Despair-Loneliness-t24138.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.depressionforums.org/forums/L...</a><br>  You didn't state you age but I'm giving you a teen forum that deals with loneliness, and families:<br>  <a href="http://www.goteenforums.com/forums/peer-yotsyps-support-a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goteenforums.com/forums/peer-...</a><br>  And as with any support group., Keep the advice you can use and throw the rest away. <br>  If for any reason you still aren't feeling like you can talk in person. You can always go to the self help section of a book store and read through their books. There are a lot about loneliness and self confidence, and relationships..So you are not really alone.<br>  Good luck and please don't blame yourself. This is a not such an uncommon problem.
HawhBNLXaa	may be he is cheating ...<br>  <br>  i think the best thing to do is to give him some time and not pressure him into talking ...<br>  <br>  meanwhile i think you should try spying on him more .. :)<br>  <br>  try to be discreet and subtle about it so that he doesn't notice ..|`|iacvdnYTaa	Somethings definitely up but it doesn't necessarily mean he's cheating.

Start investigating. There are things you can do on your own. Check his phone when he's asleep. If he's deleting the texts, that's not a good sign. If you have a family plan on the cells, check the bill. Call the numbers and see who answers. Don't hang up, just say your looking for a random person, this way no one gets suspicious. There's a program from red pill that lets you see what's going on with his computer if you can install it. A very basic version of it is free. You can see some of the websites he frequents, the first 1000 keystrokes, you can set alerts for words like love, sex, meet, etc. It can help you get access to email, IM, websites.<br>  <br>  I hope you're wrong about him, but prepare yourself for the worst. Good luck.|`|AA11808026	From the sounds of your name - you've probably wore his ears out by now so he prefers to text.  JK.

That sucks.|`|419b54befe425a1ea6fbb7f00aaf095aaa	He may just be feeling left out, not cheating. Let's hope for the best not the worst. Sometimes guys need there space, and this may be his way of preparing for the new arrival. My suggestion, talk to him not at him, let him know how much you love and respect him. Tell him what a good dad he is and how you can not do this with out him. Ask him if anything is troubling him. And if he opens up and talks just listen, do not judge because of your condition you could get moody. But just listen and, and let him know what a good husband you think he is!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|KUCbqaeGaa	whatever you do don't accuse him (until you have proof) the only thing you will accomplish is having him upset thinking you don't trust him. maybe he is talking or txting his friend. treat him extra nice emotional and sexually just to see if he changes his routine.if you are so concerned go on line and check his calls. good luck.|`|b844256a273aaed20dd13e0a5e4a82b0aa	He must be cheating.|`|HqoOjAHVaa	no he jus needs his space|`|E59mK1FUaa	Well it could be that he's going through a time where he's hanging out with his buddies more.. or it could be something else. But there's way more signs to go by. Such as, is he spending more time grooming himself than usual? - like is he keeping up with shaving, or wearing a cologne? Does he seem distracted a lot? Is he out of the house more than normal or is he calling saying he'll be home from work late? Only you know your husband, and you'll be able to tell if something is wrong. Give it more time before you confront him, and pay attention to these warning signs.|`|2y7YvU4iaa	i really hope he's not cheating.even though it might look like he is hiding something you could just straight up ask him. i have been married for 5. my mind wanders sometimes and i get paranoid of dumb things that make no sense. but if something is really bothering you , let him know.<br>  talking is the best thing.<br>  and if he is, don;t worry, you can only hide something for so long before it is discovered.<br>  all we could do is trust they won't<br>  <br>  i hope is just paranoia, heck i hope my own is really paranoia lol|`|PcPswmv5aa	The phone is a dead give away.  If he keeps the phone on him 24/7 and never ever leaves it lying around then he has something going on.  Maybe not sex but something is brewing.  Is he paying attention to his looks before he goes out?  Hmmm.  Also is he staying later than normal at dinners?  Is he making excuses to go places without you?  Is he looking like he is constantly preoccupied?  These are all things guys do when getting some on the side.  Phone is the biggest however.  Always.  Good luck and also maybe you are partly to blame.. As horrible as this may sound however I had to say it to be fair to you and him.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Is your birthday or anniversary coming up?  If so, give him the benefit of the doubt.  He may be getting you something.  My wife and I are not mad at each other but some days we don't talk much. I have never cheated so I can't tell if he is or not.|`|aLKXnw5Haa	yeah maybe he needs his space...<br>  or if your on a family cellphone plan you can log on with your number to your phone company and look at the details on the bill. whos number he's texting.  but the other guy is probably right... he needs his space|`|nnsuWIVYaa	Try and remember that your pregnant and your hormones are not what they should be.  Don't let things get you worried you have a baby to keep healthy.

This is absolutely normal behavior and there is nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  Now I do understand that some men can get obsessive and that is a problem, but if he just looks at things like that as a recreation then it is normal.<br>  <br>  If you tell him no, he will just hide it from you.  He won't stop.  You were right to tell him it made you uncomfortable though.  Discussing your feelings about it will help him better understand you, as all women are different in this area.|`|QMTII7gFaa	that is totally normal for a guy to do!<br>  well at least i think it is..<br>  they're just pictures...<br>  its not like they're actual girls that he can actually talk to..<br>  i'd personally let it go.. that is just a little problem in you're relationship.. it could be so much worse.<br>  hope i helped! : )|`|JajEhcsUaa	They're just pictures. Just get some calender with guys with big cawks or something to make him jealous.|`|7Icg8uKraa	Just be happy that he likes girls.|`|90ht2JH2aa	It is fairly normal guy behavior, but that doesn't make it right...and if he's trying to hide it obviously he knows that.  It might be a good idea to have like a real talk with him about it...like sit down with him and explain like why it bothers you etc. And since his excuse is that it was free you could go buy him a calendar he'd like but you can live with.  And while it is a huge temptation for guys to look at that stuff, some of them do try to avoid it because although the girls aren't real or at least not someone he personally knows, it still could affect the relationship or how he views you, despite the fact that he may not realize that and i'm sure it's not his intent.<br>  O and i'd definitely say don't go out and do the same thing...obviously you think there's a problem with it...and sorry to be cliche but two wrongs don't make a right.|`|7cf875b7f45e9951e2422060965a0a9eaa	id be a little upset.... but id just go out and do the same thing (but guys of course) .... if he can do it... so can u
b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	It could mean a number of things<br>  <br>   1. He doesn't love you any more.<br>   2. He just wants something different sexually.<br>   3. He thinks he has fallen in love with another woman usually with a    co-worker.<br>   4. He just likes to cheat and thinks it's every mans god given right.<br>   5. He gets you before you get him that's just his way of thinking.<br>   6. You won't do what he wants sexually so he finds someone who will.<br>   7. You let yourself go physically you stopped wearing make-up or you gainned 30 40 lbs.so he cheats.<br>   8. You don't respect him.<br>   9. He feels nothing will ever be good enough for you so he gives up and cheats.<br>  10.He doesn't feel loved by you.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	it could mean any number of things|`|RtkB46peaa	What is cheating?  It's when he sleeps with someone else, basically.<br>  <br>  Why does he cheat?  Most people would say "because he's a jerk" or "because he's a cheater".  I imagine this is little comfort to those who have been cheated on, though.  Men cheat for many reasons, pick one, or several in combination:<br>  <br>  1.  He's a jerk (sometimes it's that simple)<br>  2.  He feels disrespected at home.<br>  3.  He is unappreciated at home.<br>  4.  He's a drunk and can't handle his liquor.<br>  5.  He's not getting his sexual needs satisfied at home.<br>  <br>  While none of these are JUSTIFICATIONS for cheating, they are explanations.  In general, a man who is respected, appreciated, and is given all the lovin' he can handle, won't cheat.  There are FEW exceptions to this, and those exceptions fall under 1 or 4, or some variant.  Most women who are cheated on don't want to (or can't) admit to any wrong doing themselves, so they stick their cheatin' man in the number 1 category, so they can avoid any sort of blame.|`|db4310b357e8b8155cfe1bd956cf7660aa	He is looking for something. The odd part of it is, that what he may be looking for has been right in front of him and he is to blind (or stupid) to notice. You've heard of the saying: " It's always greener on the another side of the field" <br>  Do you know why?<br>  All  the bullshit .<br>  Good luck and may God Bless.|`|StJGeiFyaa	lmao at jumi's matter-of-fact comment. and she's right.|`|UAh16Trtaa	That means he is a cheater and you should dump him.|`|GfDWY8QYaa	In my experience, it means he's selfish and self centered. That's what it really boils down to. When he's out there with someone else, he's not thinking of you. He's not even really thinking of the Other Woman. He's thinking about what he wants and how he's going to get it. Also, it means he's an @hole. Even if he comes crawling back on his slimy misbegotten knees, he's still thinking about himself. What better way to be a cake-eater than to step out on your spouse and then come back to them and expect everything to be the same? He knows if you take him back it's because you still love him and that means eventually you'll probably forgive him and he can go out and do it again!|`|20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	It means he is a cheater. Womwn always blame themselves when their husbands cheat. They wonder what they did or didn't do. You have no control of anyones behavior but your own.  He is the one who broke your wedding vows - not you.<br>  Good luck.<br>  M|`|PcPswmv5aa	He wants something that you do not offer.  It is that simple.  Cheating is unbelievably common.  Marriage goes against men's biology.  I know what will be said to that.. that is just an excuse..blah blah.. but it is true.|`|WItKOQh7aa	It means that there's another woman somewhere who resents your existence, and wishes you would just divorce her boyfriend already.|`|Cpwedckvaa	It means that he is looking for something in other places that he cannot find somewhere else|`|QilfSBfsaa	It depends on what he lies about.|`|YMgm99gdaa	That your marriage is over........????|`|niq3ETl0aa	It means he's a cheater. That's all|`|3d501e757c3635c9da98b71a3cf60a2faa	It means HE + SOMEONE ELSE - YO' @SS!<br>  Or if that didn't make sense, it means NOT YO' KITTY HE HITTIN' TONIGHT!|`|W1XnsRqWaa	That means hes dating or doing it with other women
2Vl6I4Praa	Because he has no morals. Because he is a selfish, loveless, jerk that thinks with only his penis. It is time we start making these men accountable for their actions. I would pull a Bobitt on him(aka: cut it off)|`|QP1ZQqPfaa	I hope he is not cheating, but yes that can be a reason.  It is up to a women to keep her man at home.  Even if it means to please them how ever they want.  Maybe role playing can help.  Cooking new meals, or serving the meal in a naughty way.  Dressing up differently, getting your hair done, trying new make up.  Men will cheat for what ever reason.  We should keep them from doing it.  I have been with mine for 6 years and honestly with all my heart I can tell you he is a wonderful man and I trust him 100%.  I think nagging and not trusting them can also push them away. Not paying attention to them because the kids is also not good. Those are your kids they are not going anywhere, but he will.|`|ULUpOqplaa	Its called biology.  It has nothing to do with you or what you have or have not done.  And it has nothing to do with better or worse it is simply different.  It is simply biology.|`|IqBCEEckaa	As far as i'm concerned there is no good reason for cheating.  A commitment is a commitment.  But.........<br>  he could be bored, he could be interested in someone <br>  else, he could have already been with someone and the <br>  guilt is bothering him.  As him ouright why he cheated?<br>  Don't know if you will get an honest answer, but its worth<br>  a try,  once you know then you can decide whether to work it out or throw him to the curb.|`|EdBCksSwaa	Only the weak ones cheat(men and women)you married a weak little man who has no faith or loyalty and is unsure of himself.If he had any nuts he would have left you before he started this other relationship because that's what real men do,they make decisions instead of sneaking around like an eight year old.|`|TuqdZtVpaa	men get bored easy!!!! that what happen if you don't keep him happy yes he will but you know what i loved my husband....

sA8w2znyaa	Typical scenario for the girl. Girl meets great guy, guy fears committment, girl wants more, girl gets hurt. At this point you should tell him that you want more because you do want more. He's seeing other women because he's saying he's not in love and he doesn't want to be tied down, which in general doesn't look promising for any girl who wants more with him at this point. Guys just want companionship without all the emotion and seriousness that we women tend to put into everything. I've been in this situation more often than not, and usually what happens is that I end up alone. <br>  <br>  I can only tell you that you should save yourself time, tell him how you feel and if he's not on the same page, let this go as soon as possible. Maybe he could reach that point in the future, but if you continue letting him have his way now, while deep inside you are saddened by the fact that you want more, then it's gonna be a vicious cycle and you won't get your way in the end--I guarantee that. You deserve more than to be someone's option.|`|GdgHSFY4aa	any kind of long term dating could lead to a serious relationship.. maybe he only takes you golfing or biking because he enjoys the outdoors.. and he wants to see if you enjoy it too... i think you should just keep doin what your doin and maybe ask him what he wants in life... and what his plans are for the future.. or sumthing.. just an idea.. good luck!|`|rkkyNwBqaa	of course time is the key <br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  help me plz<br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ahjedc41F.PMPajnnd6EEv_AFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090306205256AA5ICtL">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|zhsTxqGxaa	Just tell how you feel about him.

Hope this helps good luck
ajV1VsXpaa	Just be yourself. Being yourself is the best option you have because you cannot get a girl to fall for you if you are anything else but yourself. Let it come naturally to you and start talking the girl that you are interested in. i guess you could just start talking about things you both like to get you guys going on a conversation...but really, if you want to find a good relationship that you can keep, find the girl that will accept you for who you are, because she will be the one who likes you for you, not someone else. And there are so many girls out there in the world. Just pretend like you are talking to a good friend when you start talking to the girl, so you will feel more natural. If you go to socials a lot, then that will probably help you get more extroverted. Oh, and I personally don't think you are a loser at all. Don't worry. Don't rush yourself to fall in love. Take it all one step at a time|`|Iv9Y8lb0aa	fiiirst of all !!! i always notice how a guy dresses himself before anything !! his clothes and hairstyle and usually wat catch my eye and my girls ! and if you say your personality is an asshole???? CLEAN THAT UP!!! no respectable nice girl will like that!!! if you actually want to have a nice pretty girl be most of all respectful towards YOURSELF and her and about the shy part im kinda like that too but i got my guy by taking the chance! if you get rejected who cares then obviously that girl isnt worth the time so all you can do is move on and pick yourself up and try again be confident<br>  <br>  one of my best guy friends always dresses well and gels and styles his hair and girls who he meets tell him that thats what they notice, they like how he treats himself and always has on an amazing cologne !!<br>  <br>  and remember that mr. nice guy does always win in the end!!!|`|xnIwI00daa	Gee, you are a very honest person! :D<br>  <br>  But the fact that you actually admits that you are an "asshole" that probably tells me that you aren't as bad as you describe. EVERYONE can be an asshole, but to be able to admit it means that you can distinguish when you are one, and therefore can stop it from happening. :P<br>  <br>  It's not hard to get a girl to notice you. BE NICE, FRIENDLY, and just talk to them. They won't bite your head off. Be confidence in yourself. Talk to them and decide based your her way of communication whether or not she is interested, then ask her out or something. You don't even need to talk a lot. Just be nice and be a gentleman. seriously, there aren't a lot of gentlemen around my life nowadays...and it's really hopeless. If you can actually be one, I bet there are many girls who will be interested. The rare ones are always the most special :)<br>  <br>  Oh! And don't forget to make yourself at least presentable. Of course not SO perfect (because that's just ehhhhh....), but at least good enough so they can at least feel comfortable to be around you and can look at you.|`|MUDLsPpHaa	ahhh i love it when guys are confused, because it sometimes feels like girls are the only ones.<br>  <br>  walk up to her, and put your arm around her, thats called flirting.<br>  or just walk up and be like "yo?"<br>  hahahah idk i love it when guys are super flitry.<br>  thats how girls fall FASSTTT|`|Rj8NJ79Naa	Ok talk to girls you will never ever see again.

I'm saving my kiss for some one that means something.<br>  What's this girl like? Is she in a higher social class than you (popular vs loners kind of social status)? Are your friends her friends? <br>  You should go after a girl you can get to know. See if your friends know her. Ask around about her. Is she friendly to you? Does she know you? You're less likely to be rejected if you start a friendship first. You should feel comfortable with her before you ask her out. As long as you're friendly and sweet, your chances are higher. Some how get her and a big group of friends to hang out. Get to know her. Compliment her without being too completely flirty. Simply say, "Hey I really like you necklace (or whatever). Where did you get it?" she will feel important. Ask her about her interests. Have a discussion with her. After you know her, ask her "Hey are you busy later, we should hang." You just need to know her first. Don't rush it. And you're not a loser.

He will have to decide which one of you he wants to be with, and he will get tired of you putting someone else first before him. Or he may have to be xx too.<br>  <br>  I hate the games men play. A woman would be scared to do this, afraid of loosing him to the x. DUMB MEN.....

How goes it :)?" or something. It'll show in the way you write it. If he didn't have the courage to say anything, then now he has an excuse and you've written an innocent hello.<br>  <br>  Just keep it casual, and see how it goes.

xnIwI00daa	Don't be afraid of something like that. That would only make you more nervous and then you would not make a very good impression. Think: confidence. Think to yourself that you are amazing the way you are. Be casual and go up to her and say, "hi. My name is (insert name here). What's your name? How are you?" Don't use cliche or cheesy catch phrase though. It gets really annoying. Be friendly and just talk. Don't need to make it so extraordinary. Just be simple, be nice, and such and that should be enough for a first impression. Don't be too pushy or needy. Don't act as though you REALLY want her - that's just a turn off for me on first meeting. And talk as though you would talk to your other friends who is a girl!|`|9a506c84f370dbf2fecea59b04578a36aa	Be smooth and just take a deep breath and do it.

I know it seems like a big deal and you can think of a million things that could go wrong but also think of the things that can go right. Just deep breath, think of what you're going to say before you say it, and CONFIDENCE. act like you know what you're doing.

Im a nerdy biology student who is not into drinking or smoking or persistent partying. My bf is the "bad boy" who doesn't do great in college, plus he plays and deals poker. At first I was scared of his habits, thinking he may get me into trouble or push me into it. But then I realized hes smart, and not a jerk like a lot of partying guys are. So  I began to look past it, Hes just having harmless fun! I told him I was nervous, so he always told me everything that happened when he was drinking/partying etc, which at first made me nervous but after awhile it really helped. Also, if i am feeling particularly sensitive one night he has plans(like girls usually get sometimes) he wont go out, and he'll stay with me.

fBJ89X7yaa	Hey never tell a man you are falling for him! These guys will only tease us even more. And never leave a man just because he is genuine. They masturbate a lot and they advocate the same to us its natural. Why do you want to give yourself to him when he doesn't need it. Let him earn your love.<br>  <br>  Why why the hell you date a guy who is not interested in you sexually? Well it is for some other good quality, even money is good I tell you who cares how he earned when he will be ready to spend or have it dispensed for you. SOme dumb men do show their love that way. Just take it easy.<br>  <br>  Have a cool cola and turn to life make it simple and its a nice rose in the garden feel the freshness. You have a man who had experienced love and he wants to be genuine atleast with you and do it only when he feels the best.<br>  <br>  But be sure he hasn't lost his sexual appetite. Hey talk more lighter things may be the guy is stressed out in job or something that he is hesitating to tell you. He may be caring not to pass on the hard feelings to you. Help him out!<br>  <br>  Loosing virginity your sister must be mad or it was just lust what has she gained would she have been happier getting pregnant at 14? Having your first passionate moment of love is not something to be treated as a game of who's first to win a manhood!

0ktcvglRaa	Assuming you mean threesomes...<br>  <br>  They CAN be awkward because sometimes the guy gets attached to the "new girl", which can lead to jealousy and fighting.<br>  <br>  However, if the "new girl" is drunk or something or is just into casual sex, it doesn't have to be a biggie!|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	I would never have one with someone I'm in a relationship with personally, because I know I would get so insanely jealous and upset by it that the relationship would fall apart.

zzaScg0haa	It's tough to make it extremely special when she is expecting it
NzBjnqztaa	It's called life. It's a roller-coaster of emotions and circumstances. It's uncontrollable and has nothing to do with luck, only how you act. You make yourself noticed by girls, you don't just sit around. Because girls aren't exactly to most aggressive type.
oOU6XJOqaa	I am a guy, and the one way to be-friend/flirt with a guy is looking good and talking to him. Don't get on his nerves, but just pick out things that have happened the day you talk to him and use those as conversation starters.|`|Qyt5uoq4aa	Being smart is the key.  Get familiar with things guys like, and things in the world.  Interesting trivia is always a good way to liven up a conversation.  Good jokes or sense of humor is another great way to "converse".<br>  <br>  Suggested topics to brush up on: Football, Baseball, Video Games, Politics & Current Events, Cars, or Science and History tidbits.<br>  <br>  For Comedy: Don't take anything seriously, be sarcastic, but not mean.

b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	You might have found better answers if you had gone to LGBT section. Your wife does not want to be with a woman. She wants a man in her life, specifically you. She is going thru lots of pain and self doubl right now. Be supportive to her just as you ask her for support. Regretfully you waited a long time to come to terms with your important authentic self. You are happy now that your female side is emerging; while she is miserable and not available to you. She needs to accept you are changing and it will never be the same again. It would be great if the two of you could remain close friends, if possible, but that is going to take time. She needs to get on with her life. Be supportive--she is losing her husband. <br>  Right now you have a lot to deal besides helping your wife: going thru therapy, hormone treatment, surgeries. Don't forget to change your gender status on all your important documents. <br>    For more info, contact the gay center and PFLAG.org and ask for (legit) transgroups. You will find people who have just started, have gone thru parts of the transition, or have completed the entire transition and are living in their new bodies. Ask for info for your wife too.    <br>  There are couples who still live together, but I think the explanations would just make everything harder. In the process of transitioning, you also need to think about the job situation. Would it be better to keep your current job and explain to your HR that you are changing, or move to another city and find another job- you know start fresh. Plan ahead. <br>  Are there children involved? It's time to have a family discussion. Some people tell the families as they are transitioning, some go away and come back after everything is completed. Either way the families always have a hard time, so make sure you get reading material for them. Most people just do not understand and will say you are selfish by making your family unhappy, but how can you make your family happy if you are miserable inside? Please go get the info so both of you can get the RIGHT support. There is a lot of help out there for you. <br>  I wish you both much happiness even tho it will take a while.|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	Im so confused. Why do people do this? Im guessing you have serious physiological issues going on. I hope there arent any children involved. Why on earth did you get married to a woman who wanted to be with a man? This is so wierd. I love my husband for just that a HUSBAND I didnt marry him for the woman he aspired to be one day. Im sorry but this is bizarre. I would seek the lord and have him help you deal with this so you dont hurt any more people. This to me is completely selfish for you to do this to your wife. I dont blame her your wife isnt a lesbian is what it sounds like to me. Maybe you should let your wife go and go get someone into the same perversion as you. Sorry but this is my opinion.|`|fcWwT0ulaa	unfortunately for you, you're no longer the person she first fell in love with. If she wanted to be with a woman, she wouldn't have gotten married to a man.

KnTrvQd6aa	There are tears in my eyes, honey; I know exactly what you're going through, I've been there. I congratulate you both on trying to get through this together.<br>  <br>  It's not going to be easy to keep your relationship; it's going to be very difficult, but it's not impossible. I did it. Or, I should say, WE did it; my partner (previously wife) and I have been together for over twenty five years; it CAN be done.<br>  <br>  The only advice I can offer you both is;<br>  KEEP TALKING TO EACH OTHER, honestly and openly, however painful it is. You married her for who she is; she married you for who you are. Your relationship is based on your respective personalities, not your physical attributes.<br>  <br>  Talk about what you're feeling; listen to what she's feeling. You love each other, and you want to stay together; those are huge advantages;  Don't lose sight of them. .<br>  <br>  Don't hide what's going on in your head, and your heart; don't lie about what you want , and don't ignore the issues and hope they'll go away; they won't. <br>  <br>  You say you still enjoy sex together; remeber that that won't last. If you're taking oestrogen, sooner or later (usually sooner) you will become impotent, and your libido will reduce dramatically, and may even disappear altogether (and, of course, if/when you have surgery, you won't be able to have intercourse in the way you're used to). Discuss that BEFORE it happens; maybe between you, you can find a way to enjoy each other's bodies another way. Your wife may not be able to accept the idea of having sex with another woman; you may have to accept that.<br>  Whether you continue having sex or not, your wife is going to be perceived by others as a lesbian,whether she sees herself that way or not; can she handle that? Can you? Will she want to find a man for sex? Can you accept her doing that?<br>  <br>  Some couples develop an 'open' relationship, where one or both partners goes elsewhere for sexual satisfaction, while staying together for love, companionship and all the other things that a couple share; it might be something you could consider, but such a relationship requires ABSOLUTE honesty on both sides; NO sneaking off to motel rooms,NO recriminations, NO jealousy; it's not easy, but it's not impossible either.<br>  <br>  You don't mention children; if you don't have any, you soon won't be able to (unless you arrange to have some sperm banked while you still have some). Can you both accept not having children of your own?  <br>  If you DO have children,  have you told them yet? Do they understand what this means to them? <br>  <br>  There is so much to think about in your situation, I could go on for hours; but as I said above, the single most important thing for you both to do is to KEEP TALKING to each other.<br>  <br>  I wish you love and luck, and I sincerely hope you can be one of the 5% whose marriage survives transition.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	Sorry to hear of your pain, but it is a lost cause, because when the two of you got married, she thought she was marrying a man, & it sounds like that's how you presented yourself in the marriage agreement. I'm not judging or saying that you're a bad person, it must be a very difficult situation you are in, trying to find your way through this, but why would you want to remain in this situation? Surely you love this person you married to, but at the same time, have you considered that the marriage you have had all this time has really been maybe just a deep friendship? Only you can answer that & you owe it to yourself to find out the truth. As the other person said, and as you know, this is a huge change that will take time for her to deal with. I don't think that there is much hope for your marriage, as intimate relations are part of it, and you are coming to embrace your true identity. She will eventually want someone who identifies as a man, & you cannot give her that, because that's not who you are. It sounds like you are a very nice person trying to maintain your honor & respect for this woman, so good luck to you both.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	I think it's still going to take a long time. She married a man - or someone who was identified male. I don't think there's anything wrong with FTM transgenders finally coming to terms with it, but I equally don't think that she is required to still want to have sex with you. Some marriages survive transitioning spouses. Some don't. If you divorce over this, I think you can still be friends. I just don't think it's entirely fair to think that your spouse can wrap her head around this in just 6 months.|`|xLSubNBiaa	Do you want to be married? Do you want to be a lesbian? If you are ok with being a lesbian then you should work on your marriage. If you don't want to, then you have to realize that she already knows what is coming next and is emotionally preparing herself when you go off to be with men.|`|65QqZBnjaa	Diane is the only one here with direct experience, I'd listen to her.  What I know is strictly indirect.  It's going to be hard, but a few marriages do survive.  I know such a couple here locally.  Is you counselor a generic marriage counselor or do they have gender experience?  One with gender experience will be much more helpful.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
Y1gaP1veaa	just be honest and spill it out to her<br>  be like umm this might be kind of embarassing but i gotta tell you<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  she'll be disappointed but she'll appreciate your honesty..|`|AA10814202	how old are you? and how the hell do you have time to write this right now if shes in the bathroom. but tell her that you dont want to do it. you dont think you are ready yet and when you are ready you will let her know . if she gets mad, let her get mad. that will just show she doesnt really care about you. all she cares about is your body.|`|Bd16ixUQaa	explain to her that you're not ready. you're nervous and you'd like to take things slow. you really value all of her and are not only into her body. hopefully she'll understand.|`|Lwf8Xj4vaa	okay, well if your girlfriend is that into you, and you love her, she would or should understand. <br>  just sit down ( fully clothed) and talk to her about it.|`|NzBjnqztaa	Just tell her that you aren't ready for it until marriage. If she breaks up with you, she's not good enough for you.|`|aFQBF6ZIaa	just tell her you're not ready yet.|`|4WZMto1oaa	if you are not ready just let her know i hope u didnt lead her on|`|TGhwhzhgaa	AHHHHHH..

S0MOQGJJaa	This is a complex situation for sure. I think if I really cared about my friend I would ask her to come over and talk privately to me about the guy. Like tell her what he's done to you and that if she goes at this rate with him she isn't going to have many friends. I'm sure you would be there for her until the end but it would also be scary for you to come over if she is thinking about spending the rest of her life with this guy... to me, no girl should be treated this badly... EVER so she obviously deserves much better (tell her this too)... when and if you tell her this, say it in a way that isn't imposing but is definitely concerned for her well being. People like him can change people like your friend... and when i say change i mean they usually will start feeling down on themselves more and feel depressed. As for her if she doesn't want to listen or hear what you have to say, all you can do is be a good friend and kind of let her figure this one out on her own... i hope this helps.|`|914eae329dc013f1fa679fc3425c5a61aa	yes it is abuse, and I hate to say it your dammed if you do and your dammed if you don't You can call the police on him, but this may cause problems for her instead of helping her. just try talking to her and let her know how you are feeling, and try to be there for her, from the sounds of it, if she is wise she will leave this abusive relationship|`|5vbrHrzvaa	idk if its abuse but why do girls stay with guys like that i would punch him in the face<br>  <br>  i do not recomend punching him|`|AA10814202	stay out of it. i have dealt with crazy friends boyfriends . my best advice: stay out of it and let your friend deal with him by herself.|`|AA11198190	Both verbal and mental abuse...<br>  But there is not a great deal that you can do.<br>  lf she keeps going back to this jerk...then she wants her head read.
iW80AcLgaa	ofcourse not, this is completely normal in the psychopath society..infact recommended|`|FOWQ8d0Qaa	nah dude, thats fine, i see ppl punching and robbing randoms all the time...no im jking u retard, wtf is rong wif u??????????|`|4hE1Dlgoaa	WTF. yes its effing weird. why would u do that!!?!?!?!!|`|woUAjiSRaa	y the heck would you do that?|`|czfyAyNBaa	i agree with katie z!!! y the heck would u do that?!?!?!
mWa8DNyEaa	I agree with Tiffany. STOP WORRYING AND MOVE ON!!|`|ybaG8ABGaa	Personally, you guys are a little too young and the relationship a little to short to be throwing the love word around. No, I don't think he's a jerk at all. You told him he could break up with you and he did. He broke up with you because he wasn't as happy as he was in the beginning. Stop acting so desperate, if he really wants you then nothing will be able to keep him away. You do not need to worry about getting him back. Just thank God he didn't waste more of your time when you could have been with someone else.
733yHonMaa	i am not big on guys telling their girls what to do, but i agree with you on this. i would be furious if my bf went to a dance w/another woman-- & i can def. understand where you're coming from. i dont know why your gf doesn't... she probably really does just feel bad for him- but she shouldn't be mad at you. i bet she wouldnt like it if you asked her if you could go to a dance/date with another girl.|`|QD2AJv22aa	*** that guy...thats ur girl, u take her to prom sonn|`|PvQCD9Aaaa	Well, like you said they are very good friends. That is all it is, probably.<br>  My best friend is a guy, and my boyfriend isn't jealous. <br>  Maybe you should meet this guy before her prom, see how they act around each other, see if they flirt. If you don't see anything suspicious, let them go together. If you really trust her, then don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Friendships between guys and girls usually never, ever last for long if one of them has feelings for the other one that aren't returned.|`|7cf875b7f45e9951e2422060965a0a9eaa	ehh... i mean ... it is her senior prom..... idk i could def. see ur point tho ... if u knew the guy... then id say u wer wrong.... but considering u dont kno him .... n he txts her like crazy ... i think ur right... i wudve done the same thing in ur situation|`|5vbrHrzvaa	ya your right

NB4h4jTyaa	No, he can use his state ID from Wisconsin as long as it has not expired. We're all in the same country, so there's no need to prove citizenship from one state to another.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	You go to the DMV and pay for one!|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Some states require a license from the state the woman is from. This would mean that if he's from a different state get him an I.D. and another thing. Call the county courthouse in the state your going to and find out the regulations so you don't have to do it twice.<br>       You may require birth I.D.'s and etc. blood checks and so on.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Nothing.,  He can just use the ID from his state as long you reside in the state where you're getting married.  There should be no problem with him using his Wisconsin id.  I don't think he could get an IL ID anyway unless he resides there.  He might need a little extra documentation like a birth certificate or something but he won't need a new ID.<br>  <br>  People get married in Vegas all the time without Nevada ID's.|`|2Vl6I4Praa	Any ID will work. If you have any doubts there is also the department of motor vehicles in all states, where after standing in line for hours you can obtain an ID. What you really should be asking yourself is....Do I want to marry a guy from another state?.....Do I really know him?.....If it has been a long distance relationship, I bet you do not know the real him......precede with caution.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	It doesn't matter what ID you use as long as it's yours. The license will be of the state you get it in. Most states don't require residency of that state to marry there.

And I laugh every day at what a loser he is.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I don't view life through this narrow little peep-hole.  Do you have any idea how bad this economy will get before it gets any better?<br>  <br>  Do you have any idea how many children will suffer who have never been told by their parents, "No, I cannot afford that?"  These children don't deserve the misery they're going to see when the money is all gone.<br>  <br>  Oh, and to answer your question, I have no idea whether my ex has lost his job.  I pay no attention to what my ex is doing--he's my ex AND we have a child together, so I at least would have some excuse for knowing.  You need to get on with your life.|`|y21VcTjDaa	Deriving amusement from the demise of another makes you very small indeed.

In my state 5.4 percent to 9 percent in the last year for Men 4% to5 % percent in the last year for woman. Men are losing jobs at a far grater rate then women. Do yo know why? Women think men have no purpose. I think its another feminist wave that women are just firing men to feel powerful.

You come from a really screwed up background, and you've been through a lot.  And it's not fair.  What I want you to think about right now, however, is that things might just be getting a lot better for you.  This may be your best shot yet at having any semblance of a normal homelife with stable people.<br>  <br>  Of course you want to stay with your friends---that's natural.  You've had people to lean on and identify with.  But going to stay with a foster family does NOT mean you'll lose these old friends---it just means you'll have the opportunity to make even more friends.  You can stay in touch with your old friends--they don't have to completely disappear from your life.<br>  <br>  It took a lot of courage for you to come forward and tell the police about what you were going through.  You can talk to your case worker, but staying with your friends' family may not be a good idea--it may strain your friendship over time.  I know that there are no guarantees in this life, but I truly think that having foster parents truly be your best bet right now.  Try to relax and see the good possibilities, Taylor--it really may work out for the best this way.  I'd encourage you to give it a try.|`|AA11866897	Your friend's Mom could ask social services or whoever's doing the foster care where you live if she could apply to be your foster parent or something to that effect.

There is a difference between "feeling no remorse" and treating it like it's something to get over, however.  No one wants to keep rehashing something that is already done and cannot be fixed.<br>  <br>  If you cannot forgive him and get over it, you should break up with him.  It is unreasonable to expect him to do penance or some kind of sentence.|`|RtkB46peaa	This sounds like pent up anger to me.  So what was going on through the coarse of the relationship that led up to this point?  <br>  <br>  Sure he was a jerk, but do you think he was a jerk because he thinks it's fun?  Perhaps there's more to it, and perhaps you should find out what.  Start by looking at yourself, and how you treat him.  Just because he doesn't go online complaining about you, doesn't mean you aren't hurting him the same (or worse) than he did to you.|`|MVnGhbi1aa	No one is truly forced into marriage. He might have married you for the worng reasons though.<br>  <br>  If you get married for love, it isn't enough.<br>  <br>  If you get married because it's smart, it's gambling with your future.<br>  <br>  If you get married because it was teh right thing to do, it was most certainly the wrong thing to do.<br>  <br>  The only reason to get married is because you want to travel a road side by side with someone you can't quite ever get to know well enough.<br>  <br>  It is a long, hard, steep road. No one expects how tough it is going to be  and it is not for those who want an easy or pain-free life.<br>  <br>  But it is not marriage that brings the pain, it is the constant choosing of yourself or the couple that is painful.<br>  <br>  When you get married, there is no self anymore. There is only the couple. <br>  <br>  That's a tough thing to kiss a goodbye to because we've all been taught to appreciate and love ourselves.<br>  <br>  But in a marriage, what is good for the marriage MUST come first.|`|Al0fsEuqaa	hey hun...ive been there and i deeply understand you!!!! remorse does not exist in my exboyfriends life, it was hard, toooooo hard for me to swallow but God has been helpfull and i am beginning to smile again!!!oh and i left him!!!|`|2Vl6I4Praa	Because they are selfish, heartless beings.

TDiRmT9daa	You raise 2 huge, major issues and it sounds like the things that bring people together are the things that are tearing you apart.<br>  <br>  There are sexless marriages and there are sex-crazed marriages. There is nothing wrong until one partner puts a high value on sex and the other partner puts a low value on it.<br>  <br>  There are religious marriages and there are marriages where neither partner has ever gone to church and neither wants to, The difficulty is when one partner puts a high value on religion or spirituality and the other doesn't.<br>  <br>  So it isn't sex or religion that is causing the problem. It is your differences on these issues. This is what is killing you.<br>  <br>  Should you be together given your positions at opposite ends on major issues? Probably not. I don't mean to be hurtful but did you not discuss these things before you married? How can you not know that the person you promised to spend the rest of your life with wants things you don't want and doesn't want things you put priority on? Where were you when the "discovery" stage of your relationship was happening?<br>  <br>  You are both at fault for not asking the questions you needed answered. So ask them now of each other instead of on Yahoo. Sit down and talk instead of asking a bunch of strangers where you get to pick the "best answer" and reject the answers you don't want to hear.<br>  <br>  Sweetie, you don't have the luxury of choosing the answer you want to hear. You married this man. It is a done deal. His answer is the ONLY answer that matters!<br>  <br>  What you NEED to hear is the truth - and you need to hear it from him and guess what? You don't get to pick somebody else's answer as "best" if you don't like his! You get to live with what he tells you. That's the commitment YOU made at the altar.<br>  <br>  So grow a backbone and some integrity. Stop complaining that he wants sex and you want religion and making him less because he doesn't want the same things you do. Marriage is about enriching each other's lives, not depleting them. Talk to him and ask for what you want and be willing to give him what he wants.  And if you don't want to or he doesn't want to then...there is your answer.|`|EMKuBql8aa	It depends on how respectful you are about eachothers religions if it is going to last. It is very doable, but everyone needs to come to an understanding.<br>  <br>  I don't get how you would disagree about sex, so I can't really answer that one. What...does someone want to have it and someone doesn't??|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	Depends on how important either of these are to both of you - but it will put a strain on things.|`|G9ruFZtbaa	No because the 2 issues are so fuendamental and shape the relationship as a whole. Someone is always comprisming something in both cases people feel strong about.Sex and religion are too much to be in disagreement about prior to tying the knot. Disagreement on both and lead to resentment if not now but later on the line.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	If religion is a core part of who you are, and you disagree on it, then a core part of your identity will not connect with your partner. It will be amiss. Can you deal with that for the rest of your life?<br>  <br>  As for sex: where is the disagreement? Does one of you enjoy sex while the other does not? Can you compromise?<br>  <br>  More importantly, what do you have in COMMON? Why are you contemplating marriage? What makes you think you are a good match? If you really can't think of why you would be a good match, then there is a huge problem.|`|jJ7wify0aa	Sounds like they knew little about each other in the first place.  to answer your question Yes, It can work. No two people think exactly alike.  The partner with the strongest true faith will bring their religion into the relationship.  Sex, mix and match. take turns have fun.|`|fEolcPU1aa	It's up to you if it will last. If you are both in love, then it will work. Religion and sex can be worked out. Be opean-minded. Don't let something like that kill your marriage.|`|5vbrHrzvaa	i thinks sex has nothing to do with religion becouse im atheist but you sound pretty serious <br>  <br>  this a question other people cannot answer
AA11866897	At 21, if you don't like how your parents treat you then just move out. That may sound cruel, but you complain about how they act and treat you but what you don't say is if they charge you rent for living with them, do they care for your son while you're at work?  You may not like their comments or that your mother expects you to help her at her work to pay her back for things but depending on if you pay rent or help them out on bills it all makes things different.  Yes, your son is small and breaking a lamp was an accident but it wouldn't hurt to either replace the lamp or try to fix that one.<br>  <br>  Your parents are probably older and their tempers and feelings aren't like when you were small. You have to allow for that and their feelings.|`|7CPRTQSTaa	You should move out. In a normal situation it would be just wrong for parents to try to tell their child how to raise their child, but you live with them so it's kind of difficult. The boundaries are already crossed. The best thing you can do is move so that when they make comments  you can let them know that you're the parent and you didn't really ask them for their input. They have less to say when they now you don't need them.|`|hPVKMD4Iaa	MOVE OUT.<br>  Don't even damn phone them, talk to them, if they come over to your new place, don't talk to them, just shut them out of your life.  They sound like annoying people who want to have a baby again, so just tell them that they should have a ****ing baby.  They sound really ****ed up...move OUT.  SHUT THEM OUT OF YOUR LIFE, hunny, it'll be 20 pounds off your back. =D|`|TprxRZeXaa	that's just what happens when young mothers live with their parents. if you don't like it, move out. you'd probably be the same way if your daughter and her baby lived with you|`|KUhZX3Hbaa	She wants you to take your child and move the hell out more likely.

It sounds like he either doesn't trust you or he is doing things he shouldn't be doing|`|EMKuBql8aa	Sadly, cheating is common in the military as you know. I would be suspicious if i were you, it doesn't sound right. Women's intuition is normally right.<br>  <br>  Just so you know: If you do find out he was cheating, you can show "proof" to his chain of command and they will put him in the brig because in the military, adultry is considered illegal.....|`|jJ7wify0aa	Trust, is a huge part of a relationship.  Trust from you and trust from him.  This includes hiding nothing from you.  If he hides anything, anything, there is something wrong.  <br>  When prior boyfriends of mine asked me to go for a harmless lunch or dinner, my answer was "If you don't mind my husband coming along too". <br>  If what I do or what my husband does has to be hidden. It is a germ that will poison a good marriage.|`|cA3U6GFgaa	I believe you should follow your intiuations...Talk to him and express to him your concern...|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	nowadays every body is on myspace and those kind of websites and believe me some healthy fantasy doesn't hurt, I signed my husband on facebook recently and he is now chatting to strangers and I am cool with that, because I do it too and he is cool with it.<br>  <br>  We don't cheat on each other, but we may fantasize, I am unhappily married though, so don't look at me as a role model, I am just saying maybe he is just fantasizing, and that I don't think would hurt anyone, or just socializing.<br>  <br>  There was a program on TV saying that it's good for couples to have some secret life apart from each other, it helps with their identity and you shouldn't be so sensitive or jealous.<br>  <br>  About cheating, believe what you see with your eyes, anything else is just paranoid unless it is being proven. Your husband might or might not cheat, but because he hasn't been caught yet, you better stop assuming, you would never know anyways.<br>  <br>  My husband and I have many problems, but I trust him that he would never ever be with another woman, he is free to do what he wants to do, but we both have severe religious values, and for that, even in the unhappiest moments, we stay faithful for God and for believes. <br>  <br>  But no matter what , I would say, be calm and find a hobby for yourself, and take your attention away from what your husband does,,,, if you catch him that's a different story.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	[I think I speak for everyone when I say I am so sick of Blonde Wife's negative answers. Divorce him if you're so unhappy. My God!]<br>  <br>  NOW THAT I'VE SAID MY PIECE ABOUT BLONDE WIFE'S CRAZY ANSWERS......HERE'S MY HOPEFULLY HELPFUL ANSWER:<br>  <br>  WHAT MORE PROOF DO YOU NEED? Do you need to be hit up aside the head with another woman's b**bs in order to realize that your husband is being less than honest with you? Something's up! Your gut is telling you and so is his behavior. Locked cell phone? Being secretive? Female friends on myspace (a site known for booty calls and which only immature married men would go on since it's a site for young people - early 20's, usually single).....AND a letter from another woman? If you feel it in your gut....know the gut NEVER lies. NEVER. <br>  <br>  STILL DON'T BELIEVE HE'S CHEATING? THERE'S WAYS TO FIND OUT:<br>  <br>  1. I would get copies of his cell phone activity from the cell phone company he is with. A lot of times detailed call reports are available on cell phone provider sites. Write down or highlight the numbers that show up the most. Have those numbers blocked from being able to call or text his phone. (Also done through cell phone provider website or making a call to provider). <br>  <br>  2. Next thing is to come up with a fake myspace page or have a friend he doesn't know create a myspace if she doesn't already have one....then add him and flirt and see what his response is. <br>  <br>  3. If he flirts back, get your friend to set up a meeting....coffee, whatever. Then once he meets your friend, you can be at the place and walk up to her and make it clear that the two of you know each other...chat it up and watch him squirm, then show him print outs of the flirty emails back and forth, his phone call reports, etc. BUSTED. Another option, if it's you meeting him and he thinks it's someone else, he'll still get the picture and know he's caught red handed.<br>  <br>  4. If he proves to be innocent, then yay! You'll never know unless you become your own private eye though.|`|AA12072892	ill let you in on a dirty little secret. When a dude finds a girl he really likes (you) he tries to keep that girl, but may have other girls on the side. Im sorry, i think he really loves you but, we need more than one girl. its to make ourselves feel more macho, or simply because we can. Common', listen to what you just wrote down, you already know whats going on. Do you need any more proof? youre guy makes obvious terrible mistakes..|`|bSjbVxO2aa	I think you should open your eyes. <br>  <br>  If he had nothing to hide, he wouldn't hide everything! That's just insane! <br>  <br>  I know it may be hard to face but you deserve better. Your gut is telling you and you need to listen.|`|ooAFJ1zGaa	I can't tell you what to believe, but pray. Pray to the one and only God and ask him to be with you.|`|i2eZXTgkaa	My gut feeling is that he's not trustworthy.  On the other hand, why are you trying to log into his MySpace?  That's not very trustworthy, either.|`|udWGHFgnaa	honey,I'm sorry but that deep down feeling you have is your insticts and they are usually right. you deserve better.|`|M6uIbKXRaa	you could do what i always do listen to bob marley let him tell u the way|`|NB4h4jTyaa	No one likes being hurt, but going into a relationship hoping we'll never be hurt again is self-defeating. Even the most wonderful loving relationship has angry and hurtful moments. <br>  <br>  If you live in your relationship with one foot out the door, you will never be happy. Always looking for something to prove that he's cheating isn't going to make you happy, either.<br>  <br>  Marriage requires total transparency and mutual respect. If you were secure in your relationship, you wouldn't even feel the need to look at his phone BUT that option should be available to you.<br>  <br>  He might be cheating on you. He might not. Do you want to spend your life with him worrying about him cheating or do you want to just live your life? If your intuition is bugging you that much about this, please either insist on marital counseling or leave him. But don't sentence yourself to a lifetime of looking over your (or his) shoulder.|`|gk1AXMRvaa	I totally Understand where you are coming from. I think you should tell him just how you feel and let him know that you are sick of  it. he is your husband and you should be able to talk to him about anything. I personally feel that know marry person should have a myspace page unless its together. I hate to scare you but military men are somewhat dogs if they don't have Jesus in their lives. if you think basic it hard wait till he gets a chance to get over seas and to his unit. telling you what i no not what i heard.|`|yL3Qxsmaaa	Listen to your gut feeling....Women usually know that it's going on they just don't want it to be true, so they second guess themselves and start feeling like the are imagining things and the cheater feeds off of this and tries to make u feel bad for doubting them.|`|AXkuxtzcaa	To be honest girl, if he is your husband there should be no secrets between the two of you. A marriage is a partnership and with any partnership you need trust; trust cannot be built upon secrets. I cannot sit here tell you what to believe, but I can suggest that you talk to him...ASAP!!!!|`|YPFWEcIDaa	believe your gut
XbGkjC4Taa	HE LOVES YOU.<br>  seriously, that is so sweet you know?<br>  to have him pour out his feelings for you.<br>  ahh man. you're lucky.|`|KmULmT7Baa	Sounds like love, or a stalker jk ;)|`|NzBjnqztaa	It could just be that he is your FRIEND in caring for you. I mean, I love my best guy friend (in the brother-sister kind of way, not the OMG I wanna marry you! kind of way).<br>  <br>  Or he loves you. It's not uncommon for that to happen with best guy friends. ;)|`|C7Ehw7Kdaa	first you must define what difference is between "liking a lot" and "loving" someone?  what is the difference in your mind? I see no difference.|`|ptActoJ7aa	He likes you. might not be love yet, but it looks like its going there.|`|3Fma3URSaa	likes a lot|`|V5k4fpZraa	He Loves you, and hes crazy for you.<br>  Whenever a guy tells a girl she is beautiful (not hot, not sexy, etc)<br>  it means hes crazy in love for her.|`|defeBgqdaa	thats not how i talk to my friends:|
e2I6Z9Cqaa	ok dont take this the wrong way im not trying to be mean but if you told him the truth about the other guy to be honest and so he wouldnt think anything and he said you werent my girl thats way not cool, i think u chould drop him, he doesnt seem into u or like he cares about you feelings, you can do it i know its easier said then done,but god puts in your path what he know you can handle and are strong enough for.|`|2hcA3VP9aa	i think that one reason why he does not take you out because he may not be use to doing things in public. it is not your fault, he may just not know what to do and does not want to embarrass himself in front of you so he just keeps it private. i think if you try talking to him and seeing what the problem is y'all can have time to try to fix the problem or y'all can figure out that y'all just were not meant to be. however the outcome i hope this helps and im sorry for the long answer.|`|TyqGdBw1aa	yes... break up with him. but a big problem i have is with church and god and all that crap. i don't date very religious people. not because i want to take advantage of them or anything but. life is no fun when you obey the rules when there's nobody around to enforce them. find a nice guy who isn't really into church or religion that much.... i'm not an atheist i just don't believe any of the religions of today because people can easily change the ways of their religion to fit their own standards|`|AA12048821	tell him this face to face..tell him you feel he doessnt like you or acknowledge you enough and you feel uneasy, hurt and confused. <br>  tell him he has to do something ...as you can't continue like this as you find it really difficult..<br>  <br>  if he changes , fine..if he doesn't ...his loss<br>  <br>  by the way...how do you feel about him? if you love him, don't let him slip away ..fight for him ....if you don't well .....|`|ybaG8ABGaa	I find that very odd. You need to question him about this or do some digging. Do you have a gut feeling that something is going on b/c if you do that usually means something is. And trust, you do not want to be caught on Cheaters between his angry wife.|`|PqgV0A9Daa	if it bothers u so much then u shud break up with him...he's probably not the perfect guy for u...so yes break up with him..no point in staying in a relationship if it being kind of a secret bothers u|`|iCBTVyPWaa	no you shouldn't brake it off. just ask him what is going on that's all.|`|ec96ef17862cbaba494090b53f646898aa	First off, give him a chance.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't know this is bothering you, then how can he fix it? Men aren't psychic! If he really cares for you and wants it to work out, things will change and he will respect what you have to say.<br>  <br>  If things don't change and you still feel uncomfortable, even after talking to him, then break up with him. Don't get attached and feel you have to be in a relationship like this - Because you don't!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Listening<br>  <br>  [Edit for additional details]:<br>  He sounds insecure. This other guy that was trying to contact you-  I'm guessing he's better looking than the one you're dating or he is somehow more successful. This is definitely a turn off for all guys.<br>  <br>  Express to him how you feel and if you are still really interested in him, give him some time to think it through. Love takes time, on both sides of the relationship. <br>  <br>  But If you have a gut feeling that it won't work out, chances are it probably won't. And therefore, don't waste your time!|`|UZZHJsnmaa	just breakup with him if you dont want him|`|ubj2hZWZaa	in my opinion if you ask him lets go out while it is day time maybe twenty times and he makes up an excuse for each occasion then you have a problem.|`|ks2oieV0aa	If it bothers you .  Have you let him know how you feel?  Try talking to him.  xox|`|eURLdGiZaa	i can understand how that would upset you, but before you do anything, maybe you should talk to him about this, and ask him to do something maybe right after school so it's during the day. you could both go to church together or something like that.  if you are very uncomfortable with it being like a secret, then u should break up with him, but just be sure that's what u wanna do before u make a decision - good luck|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	Have you talked to him about this?  That it bothers you that you never go out in public and you don't really "date" the way normal people would?  See how he answers this. If he has plans of changing this situation, then maybe give him a chance. But if you feel you don't want to be with him anymore anyway, then just be upfront and honest with this guy and just end it before it gets more serious.|`|SJisSKUqaa	No because they aren't alot of guys like that try talking to him and see if you can find a solution. You are going to regret it.|`|Qv1zeDFvaa	If that bothers you then yeah, break-up with him
HksTtfNgaa	yes
82XPLs8Zaa	i like it, it makes me feel.....blank|`|Vi2CCYTRaa	Poor worm.<br>  <br>  Otherwise ya that was really good!|`|JZ8rkTykaa	thats good, bit weird but good.<br>  <br>  answer my question please <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApNoFa85gddyg8IYxpvGyfTAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090306210009AAmmQJT">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>
82XPLs8Zaa	i think you look cute, but maybe you walk around with a mad face, if that's the case then its hard for girls to approach you. are you in middle school, because if you are then don't worry about it, it will pass high school is so much better it's more fun, i was kinda of an outcast and now i have tons of friends and can get along with pretty much everyone.|`|TGhwhzhgaa	You are really cute. Just be confident in yourself; girls like that.|`|RrUFIMAPaa	Actually, I think your pretty adorable! Like a litle ladies man! Haha Im not sure what you could approve or do, I would suggest talk more, try to be funnny, haha.
TDiRmT9daa	You can't deny what facts confirm. It was there and Santa sure didn't do it!<br>  <br>  I think you are an astute woman to question marrying this man. It is bad enough for him to be online looking for one on one sex, but even worse to be of such weak character to deny what you see in front of your face. Does he really think you are THAT stupid? I hope you aren't.<br>  <br>  If he had owned up, you could work with that. But he chose to lie. If I was in your shoes, I would say: The wedding is off until you can be open and honest with me (that's what marriage is, Sweetie). I need to know why you did what you did before I can decide what to do. So come clean or nothing doing.<br>  <br>  I would never commit my LIFE to a man who plays me for such a fool that I would marry him when reasons not to marry him shout at me. I hope you will not overlook what has the potential to devastate you: His total lack of character and integrity.<br>  <br>  You saw it. Are you going to pretend not to know what you know? Or are you going to call it and not quit until he answers honestly, openly, truthfully?<br>  <br>  It's your choice and what you decide is going to be what you live with for the rest of your life. This is important, so think carefully.|`|IBkJZ8plaa	My main concern here is that he denied everything. Like, if he was just looking and even made a profile to see what it was all about, that might concern me a bit, but, if I trusted him, I'd probably let it go.<br>  <br>  The fact that he's denying EVERYTHING, well, that sends off more warning signals for me, and would be cause for me to want some serious discussions.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	Ugh. If he's lying when faced with the truth, that is just no good. Ask him one more time. If he still denies it, call off the wedding. I would totally forgive my husband for just LOOKING at the site, but going so far as to create a profile and then lie about it? No way.|`|U2YK6lcJaa	end it now before you waist anymore time with him your read it yourself he wanted to cheat on you if he hasn't already you deserve better.|`|AA11198190	He may have been simply....surfing the net.We all look at certain sites more out of curiosity.<br>  Ask yourself has he ever...ever in the past given you reason to believe otherwise.<br>  Then make up your own mind.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	I would be really pissed and confused. Don't know what to tell you but that's pretty f*ed up.|`|M6uIbKXRaa	run screww him just go get away as soon as u can its not worth it|`|aLgY4l3Naa	Trust your gut feeling, DON'T ever doubt yourself, something is not right!! I would definitely postpone the wedding, you need to confront him again about this and see if he will come clean, this is an issue that's needs to be worked out before you take any vows, you also need time for yourself to think things through, take a break and get away for a bit, you really need to gather your thoughts and figure out what you really need to do, maybe even talk to someone whom you can really trust and confide in or if you go to church the pastor or counselor, pray about it what ever you need to, this is your life too and you REALLY don't want to make a mistake and get married and end up regretting down the road, so take your time and do whats best for you!! Remember to always love and respect yourself because if you don't no one else will including your finance!! Good luck to you and i really hope you make the right choice for yourself!!|`|txKnh4i5aa	Definitely definitely he has proven to be untrustworthy.  You may have caught him before he actually physically cheated, but all evidence points to his planning on it (at least).  Trust your instincts.  I would talk openly to him of your concerns, and postpone/call off the wedding and take a break, atl least until he is sure that he really truly only wants you.  Better to find out now he's not happy than when you had 3 kids.  You deserve honesty and faithfulness, don't settle!  Good luck and take care of yourself!|`|DVQ7cKxeaa	as i heard all the boys are denied if they caught. it will deny always. if you think and felt that something is wrong with him try to keep silence on yourself and pray to the Lord ask his guidance and be strong for the future. before you plan to call off your wedding try to express your feelings whats inside your heart. be mature of all your decisions and pray more to our God Almighty He answers all our prayers.|`|aCMkyR3saa	i would call off the wedding  if  2 months before your getting married hes looking for "one on one sex" then hes not ready to get married only you can make the decision if you stay with him but definitely wait on the getting married part  <br>  <br>  best of luck to you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|YPFWEcIDaa	run away and run fast **** SWEET MILDRED SENT ME TO HELP YOU***|`|bV7yfxpKaa	In going back-there are some older questions.  Like, last year you had questions about blowing you off to install a radio, finding a phone number in a pocket, ignoring you for video games, living together for two years.  I suspect there are a lot of problems that go pretty deep here.  I'd either work them out before the wedding, or cancel the wedding.  If you can't work it all out now, it will not get better after the wedding.  I think your suspicions are right and you're looking for validation.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Its just good porn. Its normal. Get married and that way you can be divorced like the rest of us|`|HRIbmp67aa	He's scared. This is a big step.  Instead of concentrating on what you found, try talking to him about what's going on in his head.  May is right around the corner...and your wedding will be beautiful.  I know it's hard to understand what you cannot, but I think you really don't have anything to worry about.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your big day...it's gonna be all you hoped and more!|`|RtkB46peaa	He was still logged in huh?  Too bad those sites log you off automatically, huh?  For reasons just like yours.  Stop lying about how you found out, or stop trolling.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	I would probably put it off a little longer if I wasn't 100% sure he was being honest with me. I think it's better to not chance something like that.|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	Here we go again...another soon-to-be-married, or married person looking for some action.  Of course he denied everything....how could it be his???  It's...his friend's...his co-worker's....his nephew's......of coursehe denies it!!! Oh come on, why do men say these stupid things????  Who else could possibly be using your computer???<br>  <br>  Honey he is looking for sex and he wants to do it before your May wedding. I've seen this before here on YA.  He feels that "his time is up" and he won't get to have sex with other women. Even though he may not acted on anything yet, or met with anyone or gotten physical with anyone, he wants to.  <br>  <br>  If he is looking for something else now, what do you think he'll be doing five years from now?? I say call off the wedding. Some may not see it as that serious, but you can bet it is. You'll be glad you called it off.
PZRhGRtzaa	Hell no girl nip that in the butt quick!!!!! <br>  <br>  I went through 4 years of an annoying ex-gf and she wouldn't go away. I didn't trust her and I was right by that gut feeling. ALWAYS follow your gut you have that intuition for a reason.<br>  <br>  Talk to him and see how he feels about letting her go completely. If she's going behind your back now with texting what's next?!<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|jb3f475Raa	i had an issue with one of my boyfriends ex's.<br>  she was like always following us & making remarks when she was around. & one day she started throwing stuff at me.<br>  she really pissed me off.<br>  just make sure you and your boyfriend talk about it.<br>  make sure he wants you 100% and his completely over her.<br>  you say you trust him and thats good bc you will need trust.<br>  im sure you know just as well as i do that us girls can be vicious and just dont quit.<br>  but as long as you and your boyfriend are on the same page, eventually she will realize you won & she will back off.<br>  if she doesnt then oh well, you have him and she doesnt.:P<br>  good luckk!
JxlaxOJTaa	This is from my experience, even if you really really love somebody don't ever let that to loose your self respect. It made me feel like I have the "Walking Power!" when a guy shows me that they are madly in love with me. I tend to careless coz I know I can walk over him. Don't give me a comment that I am mean, but that's how we opposite attract. After my EX left, it made me worried if he still love me. Crazy world,huh!<br>  What can you do if you're far away? Ask her back. If she is certain of you just being friend then give her a space and just be friend with her. <br>  Don't brag about your feelings because if she don't want to fix your relationship, you will only get hurt more.|`|4DyJE8uDaa	tell her this.<br>  take time to pretty it up though.<br>  she probably wouldnt appreciate it if you said,"hey, i have stalker feelings for you."<br>  just flat out tell her its unbearable to not talk to her, and maybe consider moving if its just THAT hard being away...<br>  hope i helped?<br>  <3|`|5vbrHrzvaa	im pretty sure you need to get laid biiiiiiiigggg time|`|4tDTQOgNaa	You sound like a stalker. As much as you want to be with her and possibly want her to feel the same as you feel it's just not going to work. If you keep this up instead of her hearing you out you might be hearing some bars slam in your face. You all dated for 2 months it seems like it wasn't much commitment in there. So do yourself a favor and just leave her alone.
ks2oieV0aa	Sure, sounds like she likes you.  Ask for her #.  I bet that would make her very happy.  xox|`|rkoxkAPDaa	She might like you. Go for it, take a chance.|`|oyuvTImZaa	Go for it!<br>  theres no harm in trying! Just make sure its casual, because if she is shy, she might feel pressured. <br>  But girls are usually flattered by that kind of thing. :)<br>  Worst case scenario, she isnt and you guys become good friends!<br>  That sounds good to me!|`|kI2IuEHMaa	I think it is better if you ask her out right away for her number before someone else does, and for me, it is better if the boy is the one starting out and not the girl.|`|Qv1zeDFvaa	If she is shy like you say, then she likes a confident guy to take charge.<br>  So work up the balls and ask her.|`|mgK3AxlCaa	Put it this way: You will severly regret it if you dont.|`|UZZHJsnmaa	well try first to ask her for number girls are shy i am very sure she is shy and she want you to ask her otherways if he said no or something like that that means she doesnt like you :S but though does she do this with every one ?|`|AA12048821	okay okay..relax!! ask her...and do it in french..she' going to say yes.<br>  <br>  she seems shy , so if you are waiting for her to make the first move..you have a very long wait ahead...<br>  <br>  go ahead and "tout le meilleure"|`|6srk8CERaa	ask for her number please!

Not to mention, you could always call about the project and then slowly change the topic to randomness.  I think it would be a great way to get to know her better.  (Of course, si elle est tres mal en francais, tu ne veux pas etre son partenaire parce que tu pourrais rater l'examen final!!!)<br>  <br>  Just make sure she's decent in French before you make a commitment to be her partner, but if she is, this would be a great idea.|`|w7aHSXCIaa	Well, if she's as shy as she seems, i would say to just go for it. She needs to be approched! I think it seems like she likes you! Especially since you've caught her staring at you and she always laughs at what you say.<br>  Also, take it slow, ask to be her partner and for her number so that you guys can keep in touch. Then sometime before the exam, text her and ask her if she wants to get together for a study date.<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped!|`|ZGupnoV0aa	ok so yeah it seems like she likes you....2 thumbs up to you bub.so go for it if you like this girl enough you will put everything on the line for her.im sure if you keep it up with making her laugh shell start liking u more..and a girl always likes a sweet guy...but not to sweet so be carefull with your decisions and go for it partner up and get her number im sureyou'lll do fine......good luck|`|t0fg5uAqaa	say.

You say she is shy then she is not going to ask you anything first she wants you to be the first to make a move because she doesnt want to be turned down by you because she doesnt know if you like her. I say just man up and ask her to be your partner and then slip her a note at the end of class with your number and have her call u. It will make her feel more special if you make the first move instead of her, she will feel wanted and it will make her feel better about herself.

JAruRfYqaa	that sucks. it depends who you are talking to about the whole fairness thing. for you probably not. and that seems like a lot of punishment for a joke. but you have to think about it from your parents and teachers perspective. they don't know that you were joking, they have no way of knowing. sucks that you got caught, and that you can't be alone anymore. dang... i'm sorry|`|JZ8rkTykaa	Tell your parents the truth!

oyuvTImZaa	^ ^ ^ <br>  woah!<br>  <br>  <br>  but yeah, kissing is okay haha :) <br>  dont go further though. youre a little too young i think :) haha<br>  cute though, good luck!|`|NbIecRyfaa	seeing that u started dating when u were 10 on and off, i think ur a bit too young and i think if ur relationship is on and off u should wait until ur both older and more mature so u can both commit to a relationship. if u think this is the guy for u then yes a kiss wont hurt but remember to respect yourself and set boundaries. im 15 and still waiting for the right guy and believe me its no big deal in waiting.<br>  good luck:)|`|0cZeXMdnaa	duh! im only 12 and i have already made out with my boyfriend with no shirt or pants on! dang chica|`|l1FfxlwAaa	yeah... but  u dont need to make out or anything!!<br>  *

PZRhGRtzaa	just wait for her. DON'T "talk" to other girls while you're on this break. do the cards/notes on wind shields (or locker whatever.) Flowers. ya know the mushy stuff. <br>  <br>  Don't quit it once you get her back either, or she'll just think it was to win her back. Do the small things all the time. They mean the most.

Ypx8MZ9Raa	I am in your position right now and it is ruining my life. I can't do anything right. The problem is not so much the social phobia I have, it is the perfectionism. It may be your case to. You feel inferior or imperfect to other beings and in turn you retreat to yourself and keep it that way. I am sad that I was a straight A student in high school and won many extra curricular awards but as soon as I graduated all of that went away because I am now out of my comfort zone. The only person I speak to is my father. Who lives in a different country. I am in the process of obtaining my immigration to that country because I can't take it anymore. I need help. And since I trust him and only him I must be with him. I suggest you find someone you can confide in such as a family member or someone who is your senior. They can work with you step by step because I know how hard it can be. I struggle with it daily and the worse part of it is when I allow someone to cross over the safety net they always get tangled. I can't live like this anymore, I have no friends, nobody wants to be my friend and I am miserable and depressed.<br>  <br>  You are not alone. Keep your head up and you will find a way to beat this.|`|Gdom3LeJaa	hey don't be lonely<br>  <br>  whenever I'm lonely Jesus is always there for me.

Wrestling and Football are over and off season lifting is taking a break for a week.  I have a lot of time and not a lot of homework.  You have a best friend that's a dude right? Talk to him and when he hangs out with girls ask if you can tag along.  Then just ask if any of the girls want to hang out again sometimes soon. Then they say yes and you ask for some numbers.  Text them a bit.  And before you know it you are part of a hang out group.  I don't know how to respond to girls callin me cute too. It justs makes me feel uncomfortable so i just say thanks.|`|thOwKnWgaa	It's fine, your not a failure like the other person said. Everybody has something and it's all way worse than what you have. I always feal better giving people advise.  You sound like a nice person I think you would have fun voulnterring.

Dont give up you can do it I know it!!!|`|yy8WPgXzaa	aww, don't give up (:<br>  i know what you mean, i feel alone alot, i have a hard time getting to know people at first, i just get stuck! but it comes in time, don't just give up! If your sure you have that go see a doctor, he may help (: and for friends you should just start up a conversation about anything random! a guy of coarse, because if your more comfortable around them then girls, start with guys and build your self-confidence back up! You sound like a nice guy to me (: so just talk to people in your classes, if anything just start with, so do you like this class? Also maybe try joining a gym? to keep yourself busy instead of basketball! Keep playing a sport to spend your time, or start a new hobby to keep yourself occupied! Learning how to play guitar is a great hobby (i just started) just don't give up hope! because things can get better if you believe they can, so don't give up! (: <br>  and good luck! i really hope things will get better for you (:|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Don't feel bad.  Social anxiety is crippling.  Its commendable that you play a team sport though.  You just need to boost your self esteem back up to a reasonable level and start making some friends.  Make a list of all the things you're good at and that you like about yourself.  Do you have any friends on the team you can play hoops with for an hour after school?  Just say you miss playing already and see if anyone wants to go shoot some baskets or plan a pick up game.  Once step at a time.  The first is believing that you're a worthwhile human being that people do want to get to know.  You are interesting.  You are fun.  You have a lot to offer.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	It's o.k. brother, I'm here for you. I never had to deal with your situation before, but I do have sympathy for those who are always striving for spiritual progress in life no matter what it is. Believe in yourself, it's confidence, and you also need to learn that everything will come to you in due time...don't worry about that. In the meantime, just think positive.|`|PfXuyIT1aa	Sweetheart, you're going through a very difficult time and I feel for you. O.k. first and foremost you need help to work through your anxiety. Bullying has robbed you of your self-esteem and your confidence. I suggest you work with a psychologist to work through the issues you have. Exposure therapy works really well for people with anxiety, meaning set goals for putting yourself in the very situations that cause anxiety. You've hit the nail on the head when you said you believe what others said about you, it's your self-talk that needs work. All is not lost, that's all part of your negative self-talk. You are just out of practice with your social skills. Think of ways that you can improve them, join a group ( outside of school) where you can hone these skills. Shutting yourself off is only going to isolate you more and set you up for depression. Anxiety if not treated will lead to depression and I'd hate to see you go down that road. It is not a sign of weakness to ask for help. Take care, sending you love and hugsxxx|`|ed766aacc26b258767da06e39783b5fdaa	I'm sorry you feel this way..You really should look into getting therapy for this. The more you close yourself off from the world, the worse your anxiety will become. You will just keep building up your anxiety and making normal everyday interactions seem more and more difficult. The good thing is that anxiety disorders are extremely treatable. Seriously, talk to your parents about getting therapy for this, and that will be the first step in the right direction for you. Please don't just accept that things will never get better for you, this does not have to be true. Also, If you get therapy, they may be able to prescribe you some medicine to help you with this problem. It doesn't necessarily have to be long-term medication, maybe just something to help calm your anxiety until you are able to better cope with this problem. I hope this helps. Good luck|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Ignore at least the first two responses.  I didn't read past those because they are simply showing that they are soulless individuals who are angry and bitter because life hasn't given them what they feel they deserve (but don't).<br>  <br>  First, you need to take a stand.  I'm not saying you have to run up and punch a bully in the nose or get into any physical fights.  What I'm saying is that you need to talk to your parents and tell them what is going on.  You have a right to an education, free from fear of physical or verbal assault, and something needs to be done about the situation.  The school needs to be notified of the bullying.  It may seem embarrassing, but something needs to be done.  There is a zero tolerance policy in most schools when it comes to this behavior, and the effect the behavior is having on you is part of the reason this policy is in place.  <br>  <br>  Next, you need to seek professional help.  Explain to your parents what this is doing to you emotionally and physically.  Not everyone is mentally or physically equipped to handle tense situations, and so you shouldn't feel ashamed.  After years of mental abuse such as this, it's natural to start believing it.  But you can't.  You have to fight it.  You're not inferior...and to tell you the truth, the main reason people bully is because they feel inferior, so they make it their mission to make themselves feel better by making everyone around them feel like garbage.  I know this because I see it a lot, even as an adult.<br>  <br>  You sound like you have social anxiety disorder and clinical depression, and you need to talk to a counselor to try to sort all of this out.  Believe me, it will only get worse if you don't.  My ex is living proof of that.  Right now, he's in the process of trying to fix a lifetime of feeling just the same as you're feeling, and it's a daily struggle.  Start working on you while you're still young and try to fix it before it gets worse.<br>  <br>  You're not alone, and you're not a failure.  The only failures in life are those who try to hurt other people in an attempt to boost themselves up in life.  I wish you luck in coping with this.|`|uLHtXibRaa	Its ok sweetheart..you have nothing to apologize for ok..the minute you begin apologizing for the way you feel..thats when any hope of recovery is lost..i would say sweetie try and get a diagnosis..yes its scary..but there are professionals out there who can guide you in how to deal with this...you may also need a little boost thru medication..nothing to severe..you sound very depressed...all i can say is the only steps you can take are small ones right now..and the biggest one of those is going to your G.P and asking for a professional opinion...you can maybe get a relative or mum or dad to come along with you..its no miracle cure but at least you will be able to have some joy in your life..and.. well..you owe to to yourself dont you?Plz dont think of yourself as patheric a failure or anything like that coz it just isnt true..it takes a very brave man and a lot of courage to come on here and say how you feel..and to admit that you know you have someting that needs dealing with..acceptance is the first step to recovery...i dont know if this will help but i have had some many terrible things to deal with in my life i have had to turn to someone else sometimes for support..as much as it has shamed me..but really there isnt any shame in that its actually a very positive thing to do.. .its harder when you have the issue you have..but when you are able to find some support however small it maybe..in whatever capacity..thats when you will begin to see life with a little more hope..i really hope this helps..**hug**|`|V1Zje2KYaa	You are not as unusual as you think.

EatzEjhiaa	sounds like he might be sending mixed signals because he has mixed emotions. I have a friend that shares a lot in common with me, and while she's not physically the type that i'm usually attracted to, i find the whole package (body, mind, soul) an attractive combination. Yes, men need more than a body. There are however some things we don't have in common that I know would be a big problem if we tried to have a relationship more than friends. So, I'm sure she gets mixed signals from me. I am attracted to her, and I know it wouldn't work, and being around her as 'just friends' is not always easy, i'm sure she still gets both of those vibes from me. I don't hide emotions well. She has never confronted me on it. But sounds like you may have. Honestly, if she had told me leave her alone, just want to be friends, i'd leave her alone. don't think i could do the friend thing at that point either. If you told me you just wanted to be friends, that's the most you'd ever be. too late now. I'd say write him off as a romantic interest. But he's not me. have you asked him if he's interested, or are you just trying to read his mind, guess what he meant when he said something. I guarentee you he can't read your mind. Like you said, he's not 20, i guess you aren't either. Use your words. Maybe your signals aren't clear either, and that's all he's waiting for.
MlQ0GIpoaa	First of all, thank you for making me a contact.<br>  <br>  The impression I get is that maybe your boyfriend doesn't want others to know that you're a couple because he's looking at other options. If he's keeping the relationship a secret and you're not happy with that, you should find someone that would be happy to show you off to people.<br>  <br>  As far as the friendship goes; once you took your friendship to the next level, you changed it forever. Chances are it'll never go back to what it used to be. Sorry I couldn't be more positive.<br>  <br>  Now as far as your writing goes; keep in touch. I'd love to read some of your writing, and I'd be glad to share with you some of mine.|`|35xruAUYaa	Before you do anything impulsive, confront him about it.|`|ziw77iuPaa	wait... is the only reason u going to dump him is cause he danced with other girls??? thats dumb|`|eha1fN72aa	No.. Tell him what you are feeling.. If it don't change then yes...|`|x8sFzzUIaa	You answered your own question. It's time to move on.|`|4tDTQOgNaa	No don't give up to easily. What you need to do is talk to him one on one and say how you feel about that. Because what he don't know he just want. When it is brought to his attention then he may change. Right now he may not know how to handle the situation. So just break it down to him.
qXkTatLMaa	It seems like there is definitely more, and to be honest, it sounds like you have feelings for him as well.  Now you have to decide what you want to do about this.  Are you willing to risk the relationship that you are in now, to see what is going to go on with him?  After all of this time, are you ready for something more?  What if it doesn't work out, can your friendship remain if it doesn't?  He is definitely putting it out there that he is interested.  Now it is time for you to decide what you want to do.  The ball seems to be in your court.  I wish you the best.|`|4tDTQOgNaa	Oh hell yea it's more to the story. Both of you all seem to really have something for each other. It's showing that he really has something for you than anything. I would see where it goes before saying or doing anything.|`|aXm6wS8paa	yes!!!<br>  good luck :)<br>  <br>  (ask him!!!)
3Zad0UuWaa	Do it then
45KusSDaaa	You are in boyfriend trouble! It sounds like you have a Shakespearean theme going on here! Here is how I am going to identify the boys:<br>  <br>  1- 8 month<br>  2- Couple of months<br>  3- Ex<br>  <br>  So it looks like you love number 1 a lot, because you are holding on to something that is gone. If he is your first true love I understand. You will always love, think about, and remember your first love. It's just something stuck in your head. It seems as if you and boy number 1 need to call it quits. It may hurt, but in the end, you are wasting to much time and energy on this LONG distance relationship. You can still be best friends, but I bet he is cheating on you in New York also, just like you. This is an amazing time to get out the relationship, because you are deep in, but not to deep in to like not be able to love anyone else.<br>  <br>    Boy number 2 seems also seems like another lover boy. From what I understand, he goes to your school. Stick with him! He is close by, and you love him. You got the best of both worlds!  You have a boyfriend by your side, and someone who you love. If you had to end all of your relationships but one, I would chose this one, because it is the most  frequent and easy relationship on both sides (you and your partner)<br>  <br>    Boy number 3 just needs to go. Never go back out with ex, because there is ALWAYS a reason why you two broke up with eachother. I think that you should just drop him altogether, and forget about him. Focus on the main two above.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you,<br>  <br>  Anne|`|tsOFwHv1aa	brake up with the 8 month.....he doesnt need a girl like you that cheats|`|jb3f475Raa	im 15 too so i know fully well that you are not too young to be in love.<br>  im in love with my current boyfriend & he is going to be away from me for up to a year and a half & i have a bunch of guys wanting to date me but i love him so im waiting for him & i refuse to acknowledge the other guys persistence of asking me out.<br>  honestly if i were you i would call it off with both guys to get my feelings straight, bc if you really truly love someone, its that person and that person only. <br>  i dont know your situation on a personal level so i cant give you 100% accurate advice.<br>  im not gonna say that you dont love these guys bc im sure you probably do, but you might not love them all the way you think you do, they could just be like best friend type of loves you never know, so like i said if i were you i would take some time to myself to figure things out. hope i helped. goodluckk!|`|PRi3qIJEaa	no one is like and one is love remember dont leave the one you love for the one you like because the one you like will leave you for the one they love

kkM8vFfKaa	There are two possibilities. Either he said, "I don't give a ****" because he really doesn't.  <br>  OR<br>  He said, "I don't give a ****" because he thought your friends were lying and didn't want to seem stupid for saying something like, "Really?" when there was a possibility they were joking with him.<br>  <br>  It seems like the second one to me. He seems to have taken an interest with you. If when he said, "I don't give a ****" and if he really meant it, then he wouldn't be talking to you right now. He would probably completely ignore you.<br>  But since he's talking to you it seems like he may like you. You say he's really friendly? No one says they don't give a ****, and then turns around and becomes super friendly... unless they are an a.hole and want to cruelly mess with your feelings, which I doubt. Keep talking to him, and be yourself :)<br>  It could lead to something.|`|FOWQ8d0Qaa	when he said:<br>  "i dont give a sh!t", to ur frend, he dusnt wana sound all desperate or excited, like, "omg really :):)"<br>  <br>  but he jus plays it normally without hesitation.<br>  <br>  He does like u, just dusnt wana make it a big deal. <br>  <br>  Go out with him, have some fun, learn more stuff bout each other.

If a guy likes you back, he will eventually tell you and not just keep on flirting with you and not do nothing especially when he knows that you like him. I suggest that you should just not get your hopes up with him so as to not get hurt.|`|uJd5jKwuaa	It sounds like he likes you but that was unbelievably rude when he said he didn't give a ****! <br>  <br>  Make him work for you. Don't give in you might just be someone to flirt with for him or maybe a booty call. <br>  <br>  Also if he's embarassed of you don't give him the time of day... trust me it hurts|`|4tuT0YLhaa	I think that he likes you but maybe he isn't the type of guy that is lovey dovey... just wait it out for a little bit more. If he doesn't make a move maybe he is just looking for a friend...good luck.|`|636tdBBqaa	no.<br>  move on.<br>  hes not interested.<br>  he's messing with you, duhhhhh! <br>  i've seen it again and again.<br>  <br>  your not the excpetion, your the rule.|`|LRbcznGxaa	yes! I also think he's gotta admit that to himself and not put you down by say he doesn't give a **** to his friends. just an opinion. but it's obvious he likes you!|`|lCfgqr1Waa	he likes u <br>  its sorta obvious<br>  dont be nervous<br>  he should like u for who u are|`|PuxAhQB6aa	First, you must consider this, he might be teasing you. He might know that you like him and hes just doing it. <br>  <br>  Try to seduce him. Try to get sexy with him. Don't just walk past him and smile or give a smirk. Talk to him. Dont be all weird. If he likes you, he might show off when you get around. <br>  <br>  And if he really didnt care if you liked him, he would still be outgoing when you get around. Talk to him after school. Find him when he's alone after school and sit next to him or anytime you are able to.  Pop out your cell phone and ask him for his phone number and text him.<br>  <br>  And if this doesnt work just text me and ill hit you up. ill be your boyfriend|`|inST4SlAaa	i think he just likes the attention.  i would try ignoring him. i bet he freaks out and follows you around like a lost puppy dog|`|uAzToWC7aa	he sooooo likes u!! he wants u to know without having to say it, though... tell him in person!
UgZq1pXjaa	Just pour the warm water on him.....LOL,,,,,,,that's very mean of you though and I hope he gets you back one day.
sPvhK9eLaa	sometimes i feel like that to,  try being more outgoing, but make sure you still be you =]|`|35xruAUYaa	Do something crazy. Put yourself out there and see what happens. Just be more outgoing.
wKt7l6Emaa	I dated a guy about 2 years younger than me.  <br>  <br>  He asked me out.  It was cool for awhile but then I noticed it seemed like a power struggle.  He being "the man" and all wanted to do or act certain ways, but I being the older one took control most of the time.<br>  <br>  In the end, it didnt work out.  Girls do want to have fun, but they also want to feel protected by an older guy.  <br>  <br>  I can't speak for everyone that has been in that situation, but this is what happend with me...hopes it helps|`|mCoipTkbaa	yes!!! but he was abusive to me and got his ex prego so we broke up! i was 17 and he was 15 and the story didn't end good..but now i'm 18 and with his older brother who is 23 :)<br>  <br>  and when I was 16 a 14 year old took my virginity lol...not an average 14 year old that's all i can say =p..<br>  <br>  don't do much to get their attention because alot of younger guys are always attracted to me because i look younger than what i really am, but i'm done with them..|`|en6jXxQkaa	There is a 7 year difference, I didn't do any thing but be myself.

Nothing happened coz we went off to different schools at the end of that year just after i started to like him, so i was like gah. He ended up asking me out when we started talking again like a year later but i hadnt seen him for like ages and it was kinda weird that he did that after so long.|`|YZioqlSCaa	i like this guy currently...<br>  im in 8th grade and hes in 7th.<br>  i started talking to him... but as soon as i thought there might be a chance...he started dating on of my best friends...i think he likes my he told me im "really pretty." and i told him "i think hes hot but hes dating my best friend... so. " but now i think they broke up. and i know she wouldn't care if i dated him but still... i just got out of an amazing relationship and im crushed cause the guy i was dating broke up with me... ive been depressed every day since then until i started talking to the guy i like, even thou i still love my ex.|`|oM9lWOJoaa	C it depends upon d 2 persn's involved...love is blind..!it actualy holds true..!!dere mayb sumthng abt d othr person dat makes u love dem...d relationship goes further as in my case..v cumpltd 4 yrs...so its al up2 u...!!|`|xLXVSrn6aa	Oh hellz no.

AA10065812	???????<br>  No, you cannot.  You will be subpoenaed to take the test, and held in contempt if you don't.  Any time a man learns he might be the father of a child, he should try to get a DNA test, even if he has to force it through the court.  I've helped many fathers over the years do this.  To do otherwise is leaving himself open to up to an 23 year retroactive child support order.<br>  <br>  You can have him sign away any parental claim, thus relieving him from owing child support, but you must also guarantee you will NEVER go on Welfare.  If you do, they have the federal power to override any such order, file a retroactive child support order, and keep it all.<br>  <br>  Even tough you put your own selfish desires above that of the child, legally you can be forced to take a DNA test to establish parental rights, whether or not you want child support.|`|MwVcSXr4aa	I think it might depend...if you are getting state aide then the state might require that you ask for child support in which case they may want a test done.|`|OHnndI0xaa	You don't say why the father isn't involved, which is important.  Just because you don't want him involved, or is there more to the story?<br>  In my opinion, it's unfair to take that choice away from the parent and the child.  Someday  your child will ask about his/her father and what are you going to say?<br>  However, if the father is abusive, on drugs, or whatever, your child will probably be better off without the father.<br>  It's really up to you though.  You have to do what you feel comfortable with, and what you think is the right thing for your child, not for you.|`|AA11373979	I would say that unless the father of the child really pushes for the paternity test or you would want it done, than you shouldn't need it. And there is no shame in raising a child/children by yourself, there are multiple reasons people chose to keep the 'other half' out of the child's life. You should do what you feel you need to do in order to be content and happy with your family.
FzGTAZ00aa	He likes you. Yeah, he likes you.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Sounds like he likes you but is having trouble bridging the brother-sister relationship you guys have.|`|hbmOzSO8aa	He probably like you...<br>  <br>  BUT maybe he knew something about your ex that you didn't and he didn't want to see you get hurt.<br>  <br>  Either one of those are very plausible situations.

rFmBtm3eaa	I am not sure why you think the feelings are mutual. A smile, wink, the word hi and a quick look do not mean someone likes you, especially in a working environment. It would only say that the person is openly friendly.<br>  <br>  I believe if the feelings were mutual the person you described would have little trouble instigating a quick and short conversation with you.<br>  <br>  But let's forget all of that and move on with our...err, your plans. Lets say the feelings are mutual, he's just a little shy. If the guy is attracted to you then he is facing the same problem. You both are looking for an ice breaker. <br>  <br>  In this case there is no need to fret about creating a new and exciting topic. I mean the attraction is already there so the ice breaker doesn't have to make a impression. Go with something simple, cheesy and easy like for instance the weather. He will be so relieved that the ice has broken that he won't care. Things should roll on their own from there<br>  <br>  Good luck!
wSnA8vTlaa	My mother told me i had 2 half sisters when i was 9. It never really registered to me that i have half sisters til a few years later when i was older.<br>  <br>  but if she would have told me when i was older it might not have went well in my mind for me.

UwnXYMI4aa	cuz they're girls, man.|`|8ExcR9SZaa	You shouldn't have lied in the first place! What ever you did was bad enough that you wouldn't tell her. Then she asks you about it and you deny. Then she asks your friends and gets the truth from them. That a hard blow! What else were u expecting?|`|EFGKxSsVaa	you just shouldn't lie to your girlfriend, point blank.<br>  you shouldn't hide anything from them either because they almost always find a way to figure out what you're hiding and it's just not really fair to them.. if you love/like them, be honest. and don't do things that you know they wouldn't approve of! simple as that!<br>  and a lot of people who are after you?

8RCANzJvaa	i used to think its bull.<br>  every guy that ever told me they loved me, left within a few months. i havent had a relationship longer than seven months... ive dated more than i can count on my two hands. (knock on wood this one lasts)<br>  <br>  thats when i found who im with now... ive never been ****** over by anyone as much as my last ex ****** me over... i met my bf like two months after that asshole dumped me.<br>  <br>  i thought i was in love before, believei t or not i was 15 when one guy proposed to me after 3 months. (i knew i was too young so i said maybe.) three months later, OVER.<br>  <br>  anyways. i look back on it now, that wasnt true love. it was puppy love, sorta like i felt so ... happy?... to have someone care for me that much. any guy i said i love you to, never felt anything close to what i feel right now.<br>  <br>  its hard to explain what love actually feels like, its kinda like... permanent bliss, pure happiness whenever you think about him. a smile comes to my face everytime i mention him and half the time i dont even know im smiling. i talk about him frequently, we just... click. we have had our fights, dont get me wrong on that one. we even went on a break.. he wanted a month so we agreed wed take a three week break. i didnt want the break at all but i agreed to it, for him to calm down. he wanted back after two days. and weve never been closer. ths is gonna sound a bit clingy, but everytime i leave his house after visiting, my chest feels tight, i miss him sooo much. one time i think i even cried a little when i got home... were just so attached. <br>  <br>  we only see eachother on weekends, i stay the whole weekend cause our work schedules dont allow us any other time.|`|8l4y6gxlaa	I think that it is real! I believe that when you really feel for someone and you think about them a lot and you always want to be with them, or when you feel a spark every time that you are with them then that is true love.

You just have to wait for it and you have to be patient!|`|cGNTSoc9aa	i think you know its real when the honeymoon period has worn off and its just too people completely comfortable with each other, who enjoy each others company and find each other attractive.

UU1YR1Kaaa	She is trying to compensate for her own insecurities. Usually when someone is tearing down or bragging someone it is because they have their own insecurities.  I would do one of two things, I would start bragging about being single is soo much fun!  You get to go out when you want to, you do not have to worry about having someone at the hip,that may shut her up, if she keeps on then just tell her to quit, that you really do not want to hear it.|`|b932e920875dce5892bc32431779086faa	She probably doesn't have any close friends who she wants to share some secrets with. Maybe she doesn't even have any real friends.|`|5JWyYYXUaa	I think you should tell her how you feel. It might help. If she continues to do this then you should yell at her (maybe if your good at yelling you can scare her into her place)|`|IuP0ryOMaa	I dont think she is trying to show off, I think she is just trying to share details of her life with you and maybe you are a bit jealous?

Either you have some or you don't.  You can try to fool her that you're confident enough to walk over and start a conversation but if she sees through it, you're toast.  Try to think of her not as a girl you really like but as just another person in the library.  Try to be a little funny.  It's a great ice-breaker.<br>  <br>  Start with something like "Hi, my name is..." or "Hi, how are you...".  Be sure to look her direct in the eyes and smile.  <br>  <br>  Continue with some short questions or observations like "What are you reading..." or "It's really quiet in here..." .  <br>  <br>  And then move on to stuff like "Where are from..." or "What kind of movies you like...".  <br>  <br>  If all seems to be going well, you'll know it if she's returning your look and smiling and actually talking to you.  If she's looking down or away a lot and not smiling much or smiling in a forced way, plan a quick exit.|`|gqHy3821aa	DO IT! You'll just end up regretting it if you don't!<br>  <br>  I SEE PRIDE!

Think about all those celebrity lookalikes in Vegas.  There's a guy in my town that looks like one of my best friends.  We love to tease him about it because the guy is identical, except he's a bit taller and lot more muscular.  Thus, we have "little Rory" and "big Rory;" he's a good sport about it, but it's sort of funny.|`|wDOjkaYUaa	Your sister's husband has absolutely no blood relation to your baby so I think whatever features you are seeing as similarity traits are just sheer coincidence.|`|EBfBy4XRaa	the baby shares no relation to your sisters husband at all, they aren't related by blood. its just a coincadence|`|JWNzoksmaa	usually family resemblances skip a generation.

5hxWSezPaa	Don't "guess" about whether you should divorce.  You are in a fix.  Think it over.  Unless he is abusive or you have someone else on the side, it sounds to me like you will be putting yourself into quite a fix if you divorce him.|`|3fbc09a4f95e4122e563714d654a599eaa	You need to get yourself out there.  You can do it.  I know two people who have serious seizure problems.  One well she will not do anything because of her disability she wouldn't even leave her abusive husband who abused her 8 kids as well.  I think that is wrong she could of done something.  I know another person who has serious seizure problems and he worked all of his life even drove a car.  Nothing was going to stop him.  Yes he has had seizures while driving (which I do not recommend anyone with seizures doing).  He just got lucky.  There is bus transportation.  Why don't you get a job and get yourself out there.  There are many people who work with disabilities.  I work with a lady who has no legs and only one functioning arm however she has a desk job and types.  You can do it.  Do not let your disability stand in your way.  Show everyone you are strong.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	I have to agree with the first answer. Marriage is supposed to be forever, not "well, its gotten tough, I just don't feel it anymore...guess I"ll divorce".<br>  You need your husband and I"m sure he needs you. You both can work on this...obviously the past few years have put a strain on the marriage, however its not something that is hopeless.<br>  Consider counceling before you divorce. I would try all you can. You can fall back in love with each other if you're both willing to work on it.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	For one youre taking it for granted that you two dont love each other and are way too eager to jump into divorce. Why not try to save it first before you just throw away 10 years down the crapper. Never take anything for granted, unless its totaly over and I dont see the fat lady singing here. I think she was on American idol last nite by the way or on Hells Kitche , but anyway  isnt your marriage worth a try saving first, especially when you "guess" you should get a divorce. Youre taking the easy way out here and thats a cop out. But if youre s sure its over, contact your local womens help group and see if they can help you out here. Think hard about this, please.  Good luck|`|lNl1bdWXaa	LOOK N THE TELEPHONE BOOK 4 AGENCIES N YOUR AREA THAT CAN SEND PEOPLE OUT TO HELPYOU WITH THOSE THINGS. CONTACT YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY 2 AND MAYBE THEY CAN TELL YOU.

iOpzTvSpaa	Instead or looking at what he's doing look at what you're doing, are you encouraging him to take it to the next step or just letting it stay as friends, if it's the latter than he is trying to break contact with you slowly but surely so that he will be emotionally free when he leaves and so will you if you want him as more than a friend you'll have to make the first move now but if you don't than this relationship is pretty much over|`|QNG0zkQRaa	I'm not saying that i'm right, but have you ever considered the fact that he could be gay. Its possible that he keeps you around to let people think that hes straight, and possibly to convince himself that hes straight. Don't get me wrong i'm sure he enjoys your company and maybe he really does like you, something just doesn't add because theres a bigger underlining issue.|`|1JsWMX0daa	he's a guy. and all their is too it is that if you dont give a guy sex he'll go to another girl. i do that too, but not behind a girls back. a lot of guys though do. guys are much more tense and need sex as a release a lot more than girls do.|`|WaYC7W9Haa	Sounds like he just think you are a safe guy but plugging someone else.  I need to stress COMMUNICATION, COMMUNICATION!<br>  <br>  I know you said men only but I just couldn't pass this one up.

Maybe he doesnt want to hurt you. If he just wants to be friends though, then you need to stop the kissing, its only going to hurt you more. friends are friends, friends dont kiss and make out. Tell him if he wants the kissing then he needs to commit to you and you only. If you are willing to wait for him then let him know that. I know its hard on you. Im sure he likes you. Good things come to those who wait. make sure he knows exactly how you feel.|`|hZco463faa	I think he likes, but I dont think he trust you to be faithful to him while he is away.  He doesnt want to fully commit to you because deep down he thinks your gonna break his heart while he is gone.  Or he doesnt want to be tied down to you while he is gone.  That is the other side of the coin you have to consider.  <br>  <br>  The otherside of the coin is that he likes you when he is home, but doesnt want to be tied down while he is away.  There may already be somebody else when he is away and that is who he was texting the first part of your Bday.<br>  <br>  Good luck darlin and keep your head up.  Sorry that us guys are such *******|`|idKfxUTkaa	Well breath out the truth to him. Tell him you wish for more and that you feel that there is more to your love for him. Tell him not sex wise, tell him heart and soul wise. You Feel for him. From what you say, I can tell you really have something there and that you want more. It seems he does, but he is scared that you will leave or think bad of him. He seems to be very worried in love with you, wanting to hold on, but afraid of the facts.|`|OgkGsCkvaa	I'm sure he is in a weird place emotionally having to be away from friends and family for long periods of time due to the military.  He may want something more with you and he feels its unfair to ask you to wait for him...however, logically what he says could very well be true, it doesn't mean that emotionally it isnt bothering him.  A lot of people in the military have to deal with this type of relationship issues.|`|BiNIKnYvaa	he's problay a little shook up over his army thing that's a possibilty. i mean if you care for him tell him and ask what he thinks,but he should wait until your ready for sex if he really cares for you, i dont know i hope i helped.|`|uLHtXibRaa	Its called friends with fringe benefits...at some point he will expect sex...with.. no emotion or commiment..this is normally what the majority of men require..from a woman..|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Sounds like he may have found someone willing to have sex.|`|277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	lol i see why you said men only to answer your question. he wants sex, just like any other male on the planet. but he hasnt made the right moves and he ended up in friend zone. now he's frustrated because he never sealed the deal and made it official, and both of you are in this really awkward relationship. <br>  <br>  my opinion is dont do anything. he'll continue hanging around for the next few weeks until he leaves, hoping to get something. dont expect anything to grow out of this, move on with your life. this is probably what you were planning to do anyway. too bad it didnt work out, he coulda stepped up when he had the opportunity but that window is closed and its just one of those things we call a learning experience ;-). good luck
EVKe3RHhaa	Yes, culture and the way he was brought up could be the reason why he's doing it or it could be the fact that you're grown up and he can't accept it. He possibly has "letting go" problems. Typical parents will always see you as a little boy until you're well in your late 30s. It's true that even though you're 20 you're still very new to the world and he knows it. Just reassure him that he doesn't need to worry about it because you're old enough to be mature about your decisions for this trip and will be smart enough to stay safe. He's a worried parent. His son is going to the Big Apple. What parent wouldn't be a little overly concerned? And make sure to tell him that you've made it safely there at least. I'm sure he'll feel better and begin to understand that you aren't a little child anymore and can travel all by yourself like a big boy. Hope this helps!|`|hGxuwzB7aa	I am 17 and am going through the same thing. I do think that he's being unfair (in this country/ culture).  Your 20, in my opinion that is the time when you should be able to go away and live your own life.  I think that at my age my parents should be laying off a bit, i can't even imagine what it must be like for you at age 20.|`|7pYBH26Eaa	It's just hard for dad to realize that his little girl is growing up. Talk to him and reassure him that it wasn't an issue that you told your mother first.He sounds like an overprotective dad.|`|wMZwGssWaa	well idk where he is from...lol but ya he is u r an adult.|`|AA10423186	try  talk to them|`|GCf4aOInaa	It's a cultural thing. Some cultures "release" child-parent authority after 18 yrs old or so but others will just continue as though you were still 12 particularly if you're still co-habitating with them.<br>  <br>  Tell your dad that you told your mom first so that you and he could have a deeper conversation about it after. You just wanted to get her out of the way (wink wink). He is right about the swine flu though !
qUFcR0w9aa	Clearly you can't afford to go with $100, you should save that money, and make the right decision to be there for your boyfriend. Don't pick drinking &  going out for the party & leave him upset about his grandma, if they were close or not. It's still family. I'm sure his family would appreciate having you there, and not hearing you arent there for a bachelorette party!|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	If you can't afford to go, then don't go.

Look, it is not simply about money, it is about your relationship.  He loves himself and his stuff more than he loves you.  If his friends can give him stuff, why did he have to buy them himself?  That's all BS!  Can you pay for the bills like that for the rest of your life?  He is not dependable.  I doubt he will be a good husband or father.  He needs to grow up.  There is no way you can squeeze money out of him, unless you sell his stuff.|`|MOALoKWdaa	thats the only way you can deal with the problem is by breakin up with him, hes no man hes just a poor boy who cant grow up, the only other way you can do it is by puttin your foot down and tell him that you cant spend no more money on him since you got the bills to pay and if he wants to eat that he has to pay for himself.obviously he doesnt care for you, hes a user not just to you but to his friends as well...open your eyes cuz this guys is runnin all over you.|`|uVuYdcRcaa	To him your just a walking cash machine!<br>  <br>   I know you want advice on how to squeeze money out of him, but you wont and reason being is because you have been too soft on him and the first time you paid for everything, you made him see you were a soft touch and have given him the green light to keep treating you like this.<br>  <br>  Just dump his sorry ****!<br>  <br>  Lx|`|CejKLjtcaa	talk to his boss if u can and tell him to give you the paycheck or it all is different if you want to stay with him say you are going on a trip beforehand so he has to do all the stuff if you dont want to stay with him make sure all the taxes are in his name and leave.|`|wsOjj9qJaa	I'm sorry but you have a very childish and selfish bf.

He's being a selfish arrogant jerk. He's not single anymore, he's supposed to be in a commited relationship right? because you are living together. Set out the guidelines, tell him this is his part and he has to live up to it, tell him you will not under no circumstance be put in this situation again or this relationship is done. This is really serious sweetie. He' s not respecting you or your relationship and as much as it hurts to even think about being apart for him, he obviously needs that ultimatum, your words are doing it. Everything your wrote here, tell him, tell him how you feel. You wrote above" dont tell me to break up with him" he has you right where he needs you, scared? he probably says" she'll never leave me, ill continue to use her" forgive me but you're being dumb and naive. Put your foot down, your worth is just as important as his, if not more!

Maybe you should do that as well...like another honeymoon. Go to Vegas, it not too far from Phoenix, and during this time of year tickets are cheap. Gas is cheap too right now as well. Oh but never mind I just realized how much you want to spend...thats a tad under buget. <br>  Well you can make your own Vegas night? Go out to a casino (they have them there right?

This could be a sign that he's thinking about other girls instead of about you, which is never a good thing.

He may just need alone time, and going to a party by himself could be his way to get away from the relationship for a while.

How long has it been since the death?  If I were the parent - it would be awfully hard to get over it.  A child / baby's death is the one of the hardest things a parent can go thru at ANY age.  Even though it was an accident - still it's a natural instinct to blame others, it's easier that way.  You must give that person lots of time to recover and pray that they will eventually come around to understand it was an accident.|`|khlYZvncaa	Don't worry. It happens.

HnEcgVGiaa	Hi Riley,<br>  <br>  Veterinarian is a wonderful career. A lot of vets love every moment of their jobs because they get to hang out with the creatures they love.<br>  <br>  Deciding on a career path is pretty tough, and a lot of people pull their hairs out on this. If you think a vet would provide you with sufficient income as well as fulfilling your passion, then why not go for it? It's better than just pondering everyday without much progress. You can always try a minor in history on the side. If being a vet isn't working out for you, then you can easily change into history major because you would have already had some credits for that major.<br>  <br>  But when you enter college, your interests might change dramatically. As you look around you, you see people who are management majors, biology majors, engineers, musicians, etc. They will definitely influence what you are interested in.<br>  <br>  What you pick now doesn't have to be written in stone. Your life can change if you choose it to be. While a stable income is pretty good, finding a career path that matches your passion, interests, and skills is of utmost importance.<br>  <br>  Well, to make this a "Singles & Dating" related topic, uh... I'll say I wouldn't mind dating a vet! Haha! XD<br>  <br>  Best,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|dJ7d58Ydaa	My best advice is to work on your Veterinary degree, first.  It would bring you a best chance of better income.  While practicing veterinary get into the hobby of learning history and do lots of  research and when ready go ahead and get your history degree.  <br>  Take your time, I've completed degrees in law, civil engineering and accounting.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|D45qGZO4aa	do what you have a passion for.<br>  <br>  i dont have a passion for anything.<br>  but i like food.|`|tTCOo47iaa	VET YOU WANT  TO BE A VET SO DO IT YOU HAVE YOUR ANSWER RIGHT THERE!!!DUHHHHHH|`|3ozaCLYqaa	If you like history better, and you feel as though you can make enough money to survive by getting into the field, then I'd say do whatever it is that you wanna do with history.<br>  <br>  However, if you think that a history job would make it hard to pay the bills, i'd suggest being a vet and maybe just taking some history classes in college on the side so you can continue to learn about the subject.  <br>  <br>  You can also always double major in both ares in college, and decide later which one you feel would be more suitable.|`|MOALoKWdaa	try getting both degrees and choose which one you have more fun doing

r2Yx1jd2aa	Aw, look, He is a complete and TOTAL A**Hole. He doesn't deserve to be on your mind. You don't deserve to have this happen, or have ever happened to you. There WILL be other guys, just because you aren't a virgin, doesn't mean guys won't like you. Look at this all as a life lesson, it is all over now. Life has it's ups and downs. Learn from them. I am trying to get over a soon to be X as well. My advice to you is, try spending time with friends and family. Do things you liek to do, to destract yourself when yu feel down, even if that means going out at midnight just to get ice cream or some thing.  He has manipulated you, that's what my bf does. He makes you feel attacthed, then he is an a**hole to you, then he sweet talks you when he knows you are fed up. He doesn't care about you. He doesn't love you. Because if he did, he would never have done such a harmful, disrespectful amount of things to you. If he did care and love you, he would have done as you wished, just so that he could know he pleased you, and showed some way or another his emotions towards you. Please, take my advice. leave him, before he does any worse to you. you WILL find others. Do you really want to spend your life liek this? Being tortured by emotions and every thing? You don't believe me. It may seem hard, but once you finally leave him, and it's all over, every thing will feel better, just give it time. You have to believe this. I hope the best for you, and I am truely sorry for what had happened to you.|`|WCKbUvjHaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227121256AAMgwdK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|oYrDMZcxaa	You know what, just carry in with your.. life.. forget him. im guessing hes an asian muslim but i don't really know.. anyway guys love girls who aren't virgin because they have experience. <br>  <br>  My advice is get on with your life tell him 2 F**k off!|`|qhWLPHxhaa	The one thing that I have learned about getting over relationships is that it takes double the time that u were in the relationship for a person to totally be over it.  You have a long healing process.  You need to figure out who you are first before you can get into another relationship.  I am sure if you try and talk to your friends that you lost because of this relationship they will warm up and be your friend again or go out and meet new friends.  The one thing that you have to do is stop calling him, because the longer you continue to call him the harder it will be for you to get over him.  You will have another relationship in time.  But try and be happy with being single.|`|jHskGhIwaa	I only read the first paragraph.

RuJhWnS5aa	You probably bruised his ego, big time!  I'd try to hang out with him quick, and flirt (innocent stuff now, like joking around, smiling, etc).  Tell him you changed your mind about going out.  Or maybe talk to his friends about it, and they'll definitely tell him.  From that point, he'll either ask you out again or he'll be too proud to talk to you (if he does that, he sucks anyway).|`|LOuK0Ysiaa	ofcourse he remebers u girl ...he liked u at one point ...just smile at him frm time to time, then say hi, thn start a convo, show him ur interested.

kNYDHZqAaa	Sometimes girls expect guys to be mind readers... I catch myself doing this every now and then. It's not really fair, although sometimes it should be obvious why she's upset. Sometimes something is wrong and they just don't want to talk about it yet. Just let her know that you are there if she needs to talk, and you'd like to know what's going with her because you care. Obviously it's best to be clear about what's going on and communicate that, but we all have our moments where we act irrational, man or woman.|`|uLHtXibRaa	They have their reasons like fear..sometimes..they are afraid to say if something is bothering them for lots of reasons..they may be afraid what they are worrying about is stupid..they may think whats bothering is all in their head..they may worry to much about your reaction..or they feel that they cant say for some other fear..past relationships may also influence their ability to be open..and sometimes well we just dont know why we dont say..some girls just put up with stuff and dont say anything its their personality..|`|jTV6rLX3aa	Some girls do that because they think the guy should know, and the girls don't want to explain what they consider obvious.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying it's right, but that is what some girls do.|`|55bf89b95658e65af7827cede5ad23b6aa	(1) Some girls (including me) say that everything is ok when it's actually not to get attention. I know personally that sometimes I do this because I want my man to come up to me, hug me, kiss me and tell me that he knows something is wrong and it's ok to  talk about it with him.<br>  <br>  (2) I would be very happy to be with someone who said "if there's something wrong in our relationship, I want you to tell me". My husband says this to me all the time, and it took me a LONG time to actually GO to him when I wasn't feeling right about something!|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Oh no I'm not that kinda girl at all.lol I HAVE to communicate with my guy and get everything out on the table otherwise it will just bother me more and more and make things worse.

Women tend to hold stuff back due to the guy attitude/mentality.  It's all about the moment, the right time to bring something up and most of the time guys don't wanna here it and that's why the ladies hold back.<br>  <br>  This totally causes problems later in the relationship though but men just need to learn to listen and be more tentative to the lady.  If something is bothering us it affects our sexual appetite.|`|pvVeanFcaa	well, heres the thing.

Ask him why it is he dislikes your boyfriend so much.

She probably can't change. It's hard to change lifestyles like that. You lead a life in which health consciousness if very important to you. It sounds like she isn't as worried about that. If this is a quality you couldn't live without your wife having then you do need to reconsider. <br>  I suggest you find an outdoor activity you can both be excited about! My boyfriend and I found an activity, now we love getting out. (Not to mention, I lost ten pounds).|`|0sgdOipCaa	yes you should confront her about it to me it sounds like you dont really want to be with her like your falling out of strong like because in the end looks are not going to be there forever its her personalty that matters and if you dont like that then move on|`|51843c451ddb1dc1decc4f236d232ca8aa	At a year into your relationship you should have a great idea if its going to last long or not. If you really love her and she loves you then you can make it work.You like going out and being healthy and she wants to sit around playing video games. If she has a Wii you both could play and be active. You both can reason a little. Say Hey Baby you want to go take a walk around the mall or something and I'll watch a movie of your choice. <br>  <br>  I know my gf is into the beach and I love her so I went to the beach and sucked it up. She then sometimes plays video games with me.<br>  <br>  Its all about give and take and communication if you truely love each other it can work out.|`|UFfJyCQjaa	There are many easy solutions to your problem. For example, if you made some of your dates active, it would be hard for her to say no that. In-depth conversations only work if both the people involved are passionate about what they are talking about. Talking about something only you enjoy doesn't work. And be open-minded, sometimes its okay to just relax with a bag of potato chips and watch T.v all day. People aren't always going to like EVERYTHING you do, just like she probably adapts, you should too.|`|cb94bcc3b64976e7d9c5a3c1e7b51af1aa	It sounds like you have very different interests in life, and although you like her appearance, you are incompatible. <br>  <br>  As a married woman, I can tell you that the differences you are describing are extremely important... especially later on. <br>  <br>  I always say that what irritates you in a mate when you are dating INFURIATES YOU when you are married.<br>  <br>  I think you should find someone who has your same interests and let her go instead of trying to get her interested in your passions.

Not like they don't know where he is.|`|4HoVVCenaa	It varies state by state. Go to the county courthouse and ask for necessary forms. If uncontested and no children or property, you may not even need a lawyer.|`|krQiDGCHaa	Go file for divorce.

tYO2Ir1oaa	Sounds like he's at the typical maturity age of a young guy (probably aged between 17 and 25, though i don't want to generalise too much, some of them never grow up! lol). He likes u, but he wants to have his cake and eat it. I think he needs to get it out of his system. Give him some space and he should realise how he feels eventually. I personally think u deserve better than to let a guy mess u around like that. I go for older guys as they tend to know what they want and appreciate you more.|`|u70TaWI5aa	Okay what you got to do is stop talking to this guy. Sure it is hard but there is no other option.

These have to go through a lawyer because things can get really messy when the "some family" members come to "get what they deserve".  You can maybe get away with finding some kind of will on the internet to fill out as she sees fit and bring it to a notary, I do highly suggest that you talk with a lawyer, they may be able to find a way or two around any taxes that come with all this.  Yes there are taxes to pay for receiving certain properties(real estate or cash).  Depending on your age as well you may not be legally eligible for things either.<br>  <br>  A little money spent up front to a lawyer may save you a lot in the long run when dealing with this.  Family can be ugly in times like these.|`|QilfSBfsaa	Your grandma may write her will on paper and sign her name, have three people who have no benefit involved counter signed as witness (their position is to prove that your grandma's mind is clear when making the will).  Of course you have to bear in mind if the value of the house exceed one million you might need to pay inheritance tax.
rDsKB0uXaa	Yes , but its awkward|`|GqsZ0nD5aa	I don't think is the best thing to do.Because then if you guys break up,then it's going to be weird.But if you really like the guy then go out with him.Go out with him at your own risk.|`|RILRurzpaa	well if yr sure that he likes you more than a friend and isnt juss flirting with you juss so he can, then i guess you should date him, as long as yr sure it'll work.
