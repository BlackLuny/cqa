20090309190550AAM5mgS	Local Businesses;United States;Sacramento	Here is my problem...?	Two weeks ago I locked up my bike in this huge bike cage my school has. I misplaced the keys, so I had to leave it there. I'd left it there overnight before, so I was all whatevvvv.... but no.         So it was there for two weeks, but I come back today (still without my missing keys) and it's gone! My specialty vintage bike made in Germany was stolen! But the lock (it was a key lock) was gone as well.      Okay, so my bike was stolen by kids or adults, but then maybe the school cut off the lock (don't know why they would...) and put it in storage because it had been sitting out.   I've been checking Craigslist and will go to some hot shops or whatever people call them to look for my bike tomorrow. I will also talk to the school. Any ideas, tips?      I really need that bike. It's very valuable and now I have to walk 5 miles because my parent can drive me!         uHHHH

20090309184802AAYmmhu	Local Businesses;United States;Los Angeles	Landlord Harassment in Los Angeles?	My landlord just told me that I cannot have a guest to my house.  She threat to throws me out and forfeit my deposit if she sees him in the house again.  Does she have a rights to do that?  She keeps mentioning that the rent she is charging me is way too low and she keeps harassing me for rent by knocking on my doors on the day before the rent is due and making remarks and accusing me of doing damages to the property or building shelves in the house without getting her consent.  I am pretty sure she does all this thing to try to make me to leave so she can get more rent.  How do I deal with this situation?  I am very stressed out cause she lives right next to me and it is getting worse.  I wouldn't mind moving out but I just don't feel right to let her do what she is doing without consequences.

But it does need just a bit of work. The zipper needs to be replaced, a strap needs to be reattached and other little things need to get touched up. It also needs to be cleaned.      Since it's so old, I don't want to just take it to my neighborhood cleaners. Does anyone know of a place that specialized in repairs like this?

20090309211145AAQe5ST	Local Businesses;United States;New York City	Can I collect UI in NJ if I quit for good reason?	I was an administrative assistant. I was there a little less than a year. I was not told during my interview that I would be doing any kind of heavy lifting as part of my requirements. I would not have accepted the position if I knew that. I had at the time minor lower back pain. Nothing too serious. Nothing that required a note from a doctor. Everything was fine until management changed. I was then pretty much forced to be a shipping and packing employee. Everyday sometimes 40+ boxes all ranging from 5 pounds to 40+pounds. I had made mention to my boss on several occasions that it was too much and her response was "it isnt that bad" "come on". I needed my job and even though my responsibilites had changed from administrative assistant to admin asst and another full time position together... I was still doing the heavy lifting. I gave her a written letter and I saw her throw it away. At this point I was mentally done and I was starting to have tingling (shingles) type feeling on my right side. The lower back pain became impossible to deal with. I then demanded from my boss that I would not be doing any lifting period, and that my bad back was because of the heavy lifting...she said "prove it", and then she threatended my job. I said enough is enough. I gave my letter of resignation and depleted my 401K. I thought that I would have found a job right now but have not. I wanted UI to be my last resort. And now I am at the very last of my money. So I filed for NJ UI. I have a fact finding interview in 2 days. What do you think? Is it a good enough reason. Oh yeah. Because of the lifting lower back pain is now sciatica.
