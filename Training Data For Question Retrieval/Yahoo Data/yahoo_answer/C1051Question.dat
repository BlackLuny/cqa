The results are there, I doubt that it will continue at that pace but also they also look better.  The presence of a big shot on the point seems to have given the skilled guys down low a bit more time and space to make plays.      Did you think Schneider had anything left in the tank?

I tend to keep my firearm loaded 24/7 because the CorBon 115 jhp really deform and get chewed up from the constant chambering, unloading, and then rechambering.. It's almost a 1.30 per bullet so it's not cheap. I fix the problem with a wooden dowel and opening the HP back to proper shape. Anyway.. I mostly keep it loaded since I have the weapon on me 18 hours of the day and i dont want to have to keep fixing the HP. I change my mag out once a week to relieve the tension. Do you think this is not often enough? I am in law enforcement and have been using firearms for many years but always seem to get mixed opinions.

20070202130443AA7q0LA	Sports;Football (Soccer);Other - Soccer	E' possibile il crimine di tifo criminale? E pene severissime ?	Sto seguendo in diretta dal canale 500 di SKY gli incidenti di Catania-Palermo dove tifosi hanno ammazzato un poliziotto   di servizio e centinaia di delinquenti del tifo sono in ospedale.    In situazioni di follia e CRIMINE  di questo genere si dovrebbero usare le armi. Quello che sto vedendo sullo schermo di SKY mi   imbestialisce per la criminosità e idiozia scatenata da uno sport cretino come il pallone...    Mi viene di pensare che se fossi parente di quel poliziotto ammazzato con una bomba carta farei una strage di tifori estremisti.    Se i nostri governanti avessero gli attributi proibirei quel c°xxo di pallone almeno per CINQUE anni. E inoltre fare come gli inglesi sul loro territorio di manganelli di faggio per rompere le ossa agli indisciplinati, e per rompere le ossa intendo fratture scomposte....      Maledetti mascalzoni...quel povero poliziotto che stava facendo il suo dovere malpagato...ammazzato come un cane....e magari poi la solita magistratura concede loro le attenuanti..

BUT      they still aint in the world cup! whats with all these catrachos jumping of joy, this is just the first round! Like i said i accept the loss, but they won 1-0, in a game that no one dominated, the rain made the game crappy, and there was an autogol to decide the game, it wasnt a dominating 3-0 win by Honduras, they didnt leave Mexico out of the world cup run...now i aint complaining about the loss, i aint making excuses, but PHUCK a lil crappy win and they getting their panties all wet.      "arrollidamos al charro" "no que muy machos" "a cual gigante?"      those are just some of the headlines from the honduras press, and its not just the press, i got an hondureno classmate and the day after their win, he saw me and his eyes almost started crying of joy! These catrachos are beyond extreamly happy that they won, and of course all the trash talking came, but all I said was "1-0, with an autogol, we both qualify, we are going to meet again..chill" simple comeback that made him shut up...      well what im trying to get to is, like i said yes we lost, and they deserve their joy, but damn they are still celebrating the win 1-0 like they already have a spot in the world cup...but dont they know they still have to win over Mexico, US, Costa Rica and even Trinidad & Tobago to even get a spot out there????? I know the looser always says the same thing "we will meet again for the revenge" well i guess im saying that again....we will meet with honduras again, even thought the toughest match is against the US.      What do you guys think about their way of celebrating? is it cool, does it bother you on how much they jumping of joy?

20081021073952AAzUQLV	Sports;Football (American)	Benedict Favre Betrays Green Bay?	I think this jerk has shown the good-guy image he received whle in Green Bay is pretty much a sham. First he tries to screw the team by reneging on his retirement and openly courting the Vikings. Then, after being traded to the Jets, he spends an hour going over the Green Bay playbook with Lions coaches before their game with the Packers.   What this narcissisic @sshole did may not have violated league rules but it's much more scummier than New England's Spygate incident last year.   It's a shame Green Bay doesn't play against this gutless wonder this year so his ex-teammates could show him how they feel about him now.   Goodell shold fine and suspend this piece of excrement for this stunt. Favre is offically now the 2nd-biggest @sshole in the league and I hope someone breaks his freakin' neck.

20081013073507AA5qoRC	Sports;Football (American)	Was that one of the craziest football weekend's or what?	This weekend had some crazy stuff happen. 5 last play wins in the NFL, and upsets galore in college.       On ESPN.com I have a few different kinds of fantasy games going and this what happened:      College Pick Em' (you pick the winner of 10 college games and ranks them in how confident you are the team you picked will win): I got 14 points out of a total possible of 55. The average was 13.       Eliminator Challenge (you pick a new team every week to win, and can't use that team again): I picked the Redskins to beat the Rams and THEY LOST.       Pigskin Pick Em' (straight up picking NFL games): Assuming the Giants win tonight, I got 6 of 14 games right.       What was with this weekend?

20090225101034AAc2Nua	Sports;Cricket	Should Test captains be forced to declare?	Following the mind numbing tedium of the drawn Test in Karachi, where Sri Lanka piled up 644/7dec. in 155.2 overs and 654 minutes, only to be eclipsed by Pakistan's 765/6dec. in 248.5 overs and 993 minutes, is it time to change the Laws of Cricket so that captains are forced to declare an innings shut after a prescribed period of time?      After all, cricket is part of the entertainment business, which is the reason for the huge success of the 20 over game. The Karachi Test sends out all the wrong signals about Test cricket, that it is boring, slow, and pointless as nobody wins. A game for the statisticians rather than the spectators.      So should international captains be forced to declare after, say, 150 overs? This still would give them ample opportunity to build a large total, but would allow the game to progress?       What do you think?
