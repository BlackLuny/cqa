XtdmXHMUaa	I played for two years and here is my advice<br>  If you have friends that play it its a lot more fun. <br>  Get into a big guild that uses a program called "Ventrillo" and buy a headset/microphone so you can talk with them its way more fun than the game without talking. <br>  Play as the Horde =] <br>  This game is really more of a social game, is you like RPGs there are few to none that can even match it. Tons of stuff to do so you won't get bored and you can get hooked pretty easily after awhile. If you do play, try to control your time, friends > WoW (World of warcraft)<br>  I'd recommend getting it, but don't get addicted, and make friends with other players and hey even try to get your own friends to play. =]|`|shEpxzB9aa	I hate this game just because it is so addicting and the people that play are annoying when they play because it is so annoying. <br>  <br>  as a friend of mine says, if you do not have a relationship or do not plan to eat or sleep anymore go ahead and get it. <br>  <br>  but if you can get past that then sure, lol..|`|9EXu543Gaa	To each his on. For relationships it can be bad if you get addicted, that won't really happen to you level up and raid, then it turns into a job.<br>  If you can keep it to a minimum you can treat it like masturbation. Your friends will know you do it, but no one talks about it.|`|AA12034332	If you consider that to not be a lot of money, go for it. That sixty-odd bucks will get you three months worth of time (one month free in the box, and 2 months with the card), however there are two expansions out now too (which also each come with a month of time, IIRC).|`|C60bUN0maa	ya its fun  for awhile but it becomes an endless grind after a year or 2 of playing.|`|iZ4LPIWUaa	you exactly in same boat as me. Iikedit as well and did not get addicted.  IF you can control it then go for it|`|Xz6zqZAvaa	NO!|`|QVdidSpjaa	NO... don't go over to the dork side my friend... its not worth it|`|F3aQYTlqaa	If you like it go for it. I personally pay for 6 months at a time and its $77.00, but that is just me. I enjoy the game a lot and I play quite a bit. But just remember take everything in moderation it can control your life at one point.|`|WPBo6DRLaa	Yeah i play this game all the time i love it you get horses n birds n pets i love it its huge i think you should its worth every penny great game.|`|wIdPcRsOaa	its not alot<br>  but it adds up cuz you get addicted and loose all your friends<br>  :)<br>  its like meth<br>  it sucks you in and makes your teeth fall out<br>  wait<br>  what?|`|8OeAPuzwaa	If you loved the game, sure. <br>  Just make sure you have the time to play, else you might be wasting money :)|`|cBhlsMOoaa	You can download the game for free if you know how to use torrents and such.  Other then that, its not worth it, you can DL the game for free and play a private server for free...|`|XVDZAiiVaa	Diablo 2 LOD bes online RPG in my opinion it is free and awesome also made by Blizzard .|`|wjz3RUTAaa	If you like it go for it becuz thousands do it becuz they like it!!|`|SaVVd8lcaa	Even if you like it... No. :)|`|l0r2CUcyaa	NO NO NO!  don't play it!  there's a much better way to spend your time and money!  TRUST ME!!!!

AA11575935	Things to look for in a foosball table:<br>  <br>  1:  Smooth players<br>  They should move side to side and rotate smoothly.  They should also be balanced such that if you leave them horizontal or upside-down, they'll stay that way.<br>  <br>  2.  Smooth surface<br>  You don't want the ball to take a weird change in direction because of a pitted or warped surface.<br>  <br>  3.  Adjustable feet<br>  If the floor you put the table on isn't perfectly level, you'll want to be able to level the playing field (literally) and adjustable feet is the easiest way to do that.<br>  <br>  4.  Weight<br>  All other things being equal, a heavy table is desirable so that when you get into the game, you won't move the table when you try to move your men.  A solid feel is important.<br>  <br>  Ball, handles, and the type of men can be changed, so they're not as critical.<br>  <br>  A high-quality foosball table will retail for over $1000.  Big names are Garlando, Dynamo, Tornado and Tournament Soccer/Million Dollar.  Generally, you get what you pay for, and the higher-priced tables will play better.  If you're not a serious player, you'll probably be fine with a lower-priced table.  Try it before you commit to buying it, and if it feels right and seems well-constructed, you'll probably be fine.

9fcYhVxGaa	Usually if it goes too fast, it has something to do with the frame rate. <br>  <br>  Look for it under the graphics setting and set it to Auto Frame Rate and see if it works (If such an option is available). If not then I guess you will have to manually configure the frame rate limit. Usually 50 FPS or 60 FPS should be sufficient, but there are times that it will slow down to a crawl, so the auto frame rate is still better.|`|AJIYad5taa	give it back or im calling the cops|`|1n1d3jRNaa	use a diff emulator! My favorite is psxEVEN which comes with all of the required plugins. If it still runs too fast switch the speed thing at the bottom to "nice" and it should run at regular speed. If it is STILL going fast then change the FPS limit to something lower(the default should be 200... try something like 70) and make sure the fps limit thing is on. BTW... you do OWN ff7 right? It is illegal to own if you don't own it.

I am currently doing an alphabet book for my 3 yo son, a heritage book of old pictures for my mom, a heritage book for me and working on some pictures we have taken over the years at the state fair. What do you have the most pictures of? What do you WANT to do? You get to pick! That's why scrapbooking is so awesome! I see some people even just do books all about them. What they like, where they live, their houses, hobbies, friends, boats, cars etc.... again, you decide!

AA11548618	It can be easy if it is something you think you will enjoy and you want to learn.<br>  <br>  I learned how to knit when I was 10, but I started with small items that only required straight knitting, like scarves and dishcloths.  Once I got the hang of it, I tried different patterns and made different shaped things.  It was especially fun when I had an idea of who I wanted to make things for, like stuffed animals for my nieces, mittens for my friends, a hat or purse for my sister, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|154dzJ1Faa	As with anything you are learning to do, it is hard at first, but once the mucles learn what they have to do, it gets easier.  If only you can keep your interest long enough to finish a project, then it will go well.  Some people are just plain lazy and can't bother to stick with anything.  Then knitting is boring.<br>  <br>  You have to learn all the basics, and you need lots and lots of practice.  If you think you are going to be making knitted animals after your first lesson, you are in for a HUGE disappointment.  You have to learn to crawl first, then stand, then take steps, then walk, before you can win any race!  Knitting is also the same -- first some basic steps, lots and lots of practice, and then you are on your way.<br>  <br>  Everything is easy -- once you know how.|`|M9FQSKRwaa	here is a link that will show you what you need. it shows how to cast on, knit, purl, and bind off.<br>  <a href="http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/cast-..." rel="nofollow">http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/cast-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/knit-..." rel="nofollow">http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/knit-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/purl-..." rel="nofollow">http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/purl-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/casti..." rel="nofollow">http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/casti...</a><br>  <br>  one thing you can learn is gauge, this is a must when you want a piece to come out to a certain size without starting over too many times. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKtjMv-BA..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKtjMv-BA...</a><br>  <br>  Making knots in knitting is a sin, plus you can always see where the knot is from both sides. here is a link that will teach you how to weave in your ends so that you dont have to knot and you wont see them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/knitt..." rel="nofollow">http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/knitt...</a><br>  its half way down under joining yarn.|`|ZNVV1LDeaa	knitting is one of those crafts that requires practise to be perfect.<br>  <br>  You could knit some simple squares first just to learn casting on and plain knitting.<br>  <br>  It wont take long but you need to do this  if you want to really get into it.<br>  <br>  You could even start knitting one of the animals as long as you remember you are only practising first just in case it goes wrong.<br>  It is easy to drop a stitch even when you have been knitting for years but when you have done it for a while you know how to pick the stitch up without making a mess of it.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	The basic stitches are the knit and purl, which are basically opposites of each other.

I was sitting on the floor, playing with my dog. I picked up a deck of cards and told my girlfriend I was going to play poker with her (cause everyone knows dogs play poker, right?). I dealt her (my dog) and myself a hand, laying her cards face down on her paws. I dealt out the flop, turn, and river, then flipped over here cards.

(2 hours if you have 1 coat of paint and 1 of primer). Rinse with warm water and dish detergent and scrub lightly with a toothbrush. If needed, use a second coat.

aQTlygsCaa	yea, it is very simple. Ive done it. I used styrofoam and packaging pillows to do it once. Very simple. Except, I took out the wheels and put a big banana-shaped foam on the bottom kind of like what you see in the photos.  Be sure to check if it floats in a tub before you do it in a lake.<br>  <br>  It also takes a lot more power to take off from the water, cause you have drag. Landing is also more difficult because you could tilt too forward and the plane will smack face forward.<br>  <br>  What do you mean by rudder? Turning?<br>  If your plane turns on the air, itll turn in the water. Same way. <br>  <br>  What do you mean by one propeller? The plane?|`|6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	It is best to buy kits that are made to be converted. I have seen these online for as little as $50. I just Googled float planes. It is really hard to get the balance correct on just any plane. Also you will need a very calm body of water and a pretty good size body of water . You need to have a boat of some kind to retrieve the plane just in case . I usually launch by hand then land on water as take offs use too much battery power . But you can practice take offs from water if you are not concerned about long flights, I have only flown electric powered float planes , maybe someone will give you nitro powered advice . A electric powered one is usually all styrofoam construction . They will not sink. Happy skies!

For gold charms, its quite quick to kill hellhounds since in 3/4 of them, they drop a charm. Some people also kill rock crabs or lobsters, they drop about 10 charms at a time. Im not exactly sure what you summoning level is, please add that next time you ASK since the only tips i can give you is hunt penguins and use genie lamps for xp.|`|tHMicg97aa	first of all you should use all of the charms from the quest, and then you should have 17 summoning.  After that you can go find all 10 penguins and use the points on summoning, and you should have about 20 summoning. Every week on wednesday, u should go find all of the penguins on world 60(go in riods2525 clan chat for help)Now it will be time to go kill monsters. Here is a list of monsters i use to get charms:<br>  <br>  GREEN CHARM DROPS: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  cave bug's drop Green charms mostly and a few gold, They are level 96 and found in Chaos tunnels there located near Green Dragons.<br>  <br>  (note: green charms are not necessarily the best charms to collect, I would recommend gold at low levels, and crimson at high levels) <br>  <br>  -Ice spiders (close to lvl ~55) (not sure on lvl)<br>  <br>  -Bloodvelds (level 76, 50 slayer required. In slayer tower, and also in the chaos tunnels) Do not wear metal armor.<br>  <br>  -Aberrant specter (level 96, 60 slayer required. In slayer tower) Also drops gold charms. Wear nosepegs. <br>  <br>  BLUE CHARM DROPS: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -Kaliphite soldiers and guardians (level 81(??) and 144, are found in the kaliphite tunnels in the desert.) Bring a rope to get there, and a keris if you have it (from the contact! quest). Deals great damage to kaliphites. Also bring antipoison. Weak to stab, and are in a multicombat area. <br>  <br>  - abbernt spectres these drop blue, Nose peg needed!, 93 or 99 level, slayer level required check the slayer skill, There found in canfis slayer tower.<br>  <br>  -Gargoyles (level 111, 75 slayer required. In slayer tower, and in the chaos tunnels.) Requires a rock hammer to kill. <br>  <br>  -Dark Beasts (level 182, in the light path). Require 90 slayer to kill. Occasionally drops blue charms, but due to its high combat level, is not the best monster to collect charms from. <br>  <br>  <br>  GOLD CHARM DROPS: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -Fire giants (level 84, in the waterfall dungeon, and in chaos tunnels, and the brimhaven dungeon). <br>  <br>  -Ice giants and ice warriors (level 54 and 57, in the ice caves and in the blurite caves, as well as chaos tunnels) <br>  <br>  -Moss giants (level 42, found in pirates cove, wilderness, and varrock sewers) are good gold charm droppers for lower levels. These are good for low level combat XP, some money, and prayer XP. Not the best charm drop rate though. <br>  <br>  -Most slayer monsters drop gold charms. <br>  <br>  CRIMSON CHARM DROPS: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -Abyssal Demons (level 124) Found in Slayer tower in Canfis, Drops odd Whip too . (Requires 85+ slayer)<br>  <br>  -Cockroach soldiers (level 83, found in the stronghold of player safety).<br>  <br>  -Earth warriors (level 51(??), found in the edgeville dungeon and chaos tunnels) <br>  Note: The edgeville dungeon has some revenants, but the earth warriors are at a dead end. I have killed thousands in that area, and only have encountered revenant Knights (126), goblins (30), imps (7) and only one vampire (68). If they can attack you, they are very easy to avoid and/or hide from, if they do come up there. <br>  <br>  -Dust Devils (level 94, found in the smoke well and the chaos tunnels) Be sure to bring a facemask in the smoke well, as you will take constant damage without it. These can drop the dragon chainbody (~9.5m at the moment), as well as other drops. <br>  <br>  -Skeletal Wyverens (level 140, 72 slayer required.) Be sure to bring a dragonfire shield or elemental sheild. <br>  <br>  -Greater Demons (level 92, found in demon runes in wildy, ogre enclave, brimhaven dungeon, and the lava maze in the wildy) <br>  <br>  -Waterfiends (High level, over 115. found in the mithril dragon dungeon, A.K.A. the ancient caverns.) Uses magic and range attacks, with more powerful range attacks. Drop crimson charms more often than any monster. <br>  <br>  -shadow warrior These drop Loads of crimsons for people not wanting to go to Waterfiends. They are around lvl (45)??. Under the Legends guild in Camalot.<br>  <br>  _____CHARM DROPPERS:_____ <br>  <br>  <br>  These monsters do not drop one type of charm in particular, but if you don’t need a specific type of charm, these are good. Most of them do drop a type of charm more than others, but they don’t have the reliability that the monsters in the individual sections do. <br>  <br>  -Metal Dragons: <br>  <br>  These have guides written to killing them, They drop charms in groups of 2, usually 1 (greens only drop 1), and drop all types of charms fairly often. They may be hard to kill at lower levels. They are in the brimhaven dungeon, bronze iron and steel are. Mithril dragons (and brutal green ones!) are in the ancient caverns, A.K.A. mithril dragon cave. The others are scattered through RS, I would suggest looking them up. <br>  <br>  -Black Dragons: <br>  <br>  Black dragons drop all types of charms in groups of 3. Level 227, and the best killing spot is in the evil chickens lair in zanaris.<br>  <br>  -Giant Rock Crabs: <br>  <br>  These drop up to 10 of one charm at a time, and I have had more crimson/gold drops than any other by a good amount, but they drop all types. They can be ice barraged for speed, but that is very eXPensive. Found in the chaos tunnels. Can drop gold and crimson charms more than green and blue. <br>  <br>  -Dwarves <br>  <br>  I haven’t tested this theory yet, but people tell me that dwarves|`|joItQAWVaa	Summoning is great once you get 50+<br>  <br>  -To raise summoning cheap, go to the stats tab and click the summoning skill.

OvFukdd6aa	Im gunna assume you have Crystal... Cause you didn't say Suicune.<br>  <br>  Nope. No cheat. Sorry i know its not the answer you were looking for, but the only way to catch raikou is by either trading with a friend or just plain hard work and elbow grease =]|`|1c3AXFCnaa	if you want raikou your starter needs to be squirtle|`|bzmVEMrHaa	r u talking about leaf green or gold version?<br>  if leaf green...then u have cuaght entei, u chose balbusaur as ur starter. in order to catch rakou or suicune, it will require another leaf green or fire red. u will have to choose Squrtle on your other leaf green/fire red then complete the game (the part where u could catch the legendary dogs) then u catch it, trade it to your main leaf green/fire red.if u wana get suicune then trade all ur good poke to ur main leaf green/fire red then start new game n choose charmander to get suicune then reapeat as above. hope this helped

l6lh6fT8aa	Here are all the ways to kill an indestructible creature:<br>  <br>  -Drop the toughness to 0 or less. This is the most common method.<br>  -Force the opponent to sacrifice it, with a spell like Cruel Edict or Mercy Killing.<br>  -Remove it from the game with a spell like Unmake or Path to Exile.<br>  -Remove abilities from it by using a spell like Ovinize or Humble, then kill it normally.<br>  <br>  Also, remember that Wither creatures can easily kill Indestructible creatures.|`|fPavekfeaa	Indestructible makes a creature immune to cards that specifically say "destroy" or to lethal damage from combat.<br>  <br>  So a 1/1 indestructible can block even a creature with 100 power and will not be sent to the graveyard.<br>  <br>  Any creature that is reduced to a toughness of 0 however is sent to the graveyard, even indestructible creatures. So in your example above the infest taking the creature down to 0 toughness would send it to the graveyard.|`|eu0AJenBaa	Eveybody who answered is correct.  Just a little sidenote, whither counters do the job pretty well against indestructable creatures.

I had the original Pro & now I have the Elite (my Pro was stolen).  The extra $100 for the Elite is worth it to get double the hard drive.|`|zuQWwEeYaa	Get the elite if you want to rip cds, install your games for improved loading times, and download lots of stuff. These are the main HDD space eaters.<br>  <br>  The pro should be fine if you don't have many games/ have a small music collection/ aren't getting xbox live.<br>  <br>  But then again, I do find that the white xbox is inferior. It's tacky looking and gets dirty easily; while the elite is much more suave and hides dirt/dust well, but looks a bit plastic-y.<br>  <br>  That's just personal preference regarding aesthetics though really...<br>  <br>  I own an elite btw, but a few of my friends have the arcade or pro versions.<br>  <br>  Ultimately it depends on how you're going to use it, and which one you think looks best.<br>  <br>  Good luck deciding.|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	Elite if you are going to download a lot of things, Pro if you just want the Xbox.

ickyq53aaa	On the Isle of Gust in the Temple of Wind<br>  B2 Floor<br>  <br>  Use bombs to break the door here, then head out to a large, sandy room where more of the sandworms await you. Bomb them if you can, but you need to head to the middle of the room and check the map there; that'll point out four particular airjets that need to be dug up. Move around and dig up the four spots; that'll unlock two doors here, one to the north and one to the southwest. You can find a Power Gem on the western side of this room, by the way.<br>  <br>  If you head out the door to the north, you can bomb a barrier and come back out to the B1 floor. Move south from there and push the wind statue to the left to set it to move the windmill there. Head back down to B2, proceed up the southwestern stairs, then repeat the process on the other windmill to bring down a Small Key.<br>  <br>  Take the small key and return to floor B2, where you can unlock the door in the northeastern corner of the room. Doing so will lead you to the Bombs. Nab them and stash them on your equipment bar. Time to blow some stuff up!|`|ogDNumbBaa	I cant remember well but i think you need to buy it off the trade guy on the boat or at one of the shop places

zuQWwEeYaa	After holding out in the rotunda with her, it doesn't really matter if she lives or dies. If/when she does kick the bucket, make sure to loot her corpse.<br>  <br>  That way you can get her SMG which is waaaay better than a normal SMG (I think it has about 50 power when fully repaired).<br>  <br>  As for the quest, you should make sure you have plenty of pulse grenades/mines and head down to the basement, fighting off any super mutants on the way and take the north door at the bottom of the stairs. There's a ton of robots down there so it's pulse weapons all the way. Sidney's SMG will come in handy too. <br>  <br>  It's then just a case of following your marker through to the room where the Declaration of Independence is stored.<br>  <br>  There's a ton of funny ways to get hold of the thing from it's keeper when you get there...|`|NCMs9oFSaa	If you keep sydney alive and escort her to underworld alive (you have to follow her through the metro tunnel) after you finish the stealing of Independence quest she becomes a weapons trader. A source of more ammunition. You can give her stimpaks to heal herself by using the dialogue box during the quest or you can leave the building and she will follow you. Then you can come back later when you are better equipped.<br>  <br>   There is also another quest if you keep her alive. You have to find a holodisk on her dead fathers skeleton in a bed in the statesman hotel during the rileys ranger quest and return it to her. Then she finds out about her father and gives you her gun.<br>  <br>  You can also tell her to stay in one place and wait for you. Then you can go and kill all the robots and mutants.
6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	Get one that is simple looking . just the basics wings ,body ,tail and rudder. A top wing design is easier to learn on . Go to websites that sell them they are usually categorized by , beginner, intermediate, expert. You can get a good plane for $50 or less plus shipping . It is easier to start out with electric power. <br>  When you get your plane , find the largest area to fly you can. If you can find a person with experience to help you . You can teach yourself ,but you will crash a lot of planes ! Two good online stores are Raidentech,and e hobby store . I bought from both and they are good ,I'm sure there are others .

It might also have something to do with the game.  CoD has death match, so I think some guys will be asses when it comes to death match.  I think they think it gives them an advantage if they can psyche you out.  <br>  <br>  The other reason could be that they might feel embarrass if they lose to a girl in a death match.|`|q6uyloYdaa	Probably because it makes them feel like a big macho man. I used to play World of Warcraft and after people discovered I was a girl I got a lot of insults and rude messages for no reason. For that very reason I don't play online on my 360 because I don't have the patience to deal with such idiots. :P<br>  Little do they know that REAL men don't hate on women!|`|gu0AxKyiaa	wow im sorry you have to go through that if you wanna friend to play call of duty with or anyother games we may have in common my gamertag is    HateMeNow36   ... i think its kool how girls play video games, if i was you i would just talk **** back,  or tell them not to hate on you|`|ZAQCvcIyaa	I dont know why they do that.

b3b268bd86d730469f543b3c4b321e88aa	There are two settings - Default and Alternate.  Default is a pretty standard video game configuration - X = attack, thumbstick moves, etc.  <br>  Alternate seems a little more basic and uses the shape buttons for some movement, foregoing the ability to roll (for infantry). <br>  <br>  you can change axis and modify sensitivities  in Advanced Controls settings.<br>  <br>  All in all the control is pretty good it isn't really lacking much the joystick is standard like any console controller, and button configuration is kind of the same

(i didnt see anything wrong with Shadow the hedgehog game)<br>  <br>  but sonic fans are prolly the most B****y, whiney, demanding fans you will ever see in your life.  (i know, i'm on the inside, it's not pretty)<br>  They whine for more speed, then they whine cuz he's too fast.  They whine becuz "all the plots are the same old, same old", then they whine becuz they're is too many characters.<br>  <br>  Me, i'm in a minority group of the sonic fans who basically like every game that is put out.  So, to answer you question plainly, Yes I would love a game with a crazy plot twist like that (and some others would too i'd imagine).  But the MAJORITY would prolly Have a COW.

UYAL34lFaa	Mario Kart is fun if you want to just play online at any time, as well as Brawl. If you have friends that you'd like to play with, then probably Animal Crossing, cuz of the Wii Speak.|`|7hddNFOTaa	The best server for finding games would be Mario Kart which is a fun game. Super Smash Bros Brawl is personally my favorite Wifi Wii game, but seems to take forever to find an online match. If you have friends with Wii codes, Brawl is the way to go. The Third best wifi game would be Mario Striker's charged, which is a soccer game with great online play. i personally don't really like soccer, but this is probably the best sports game i've ever played. Lastly Animal Crossing Wii is wifi, but you have to have the friend codes from your friends to play online.|`|AA10020760	I like Mario Cart|`|BFIW3qGYaa	there's a few good game<br>  call of duty 5<br>  mario cart<br>  gutair hero world tour<br>  smash brothers brawl<br>  mario and sonic at the olympics<br>  are some of my favs|`|rYf50rBlaa	Go to www.nintendo.com

fp7Jk1gVaa	No! Not at all. It comes with the game, just sometimes takes a very, very long time to load. It may slow down the computer, but it won't give you viruses. <br>  <br>  You can get viruses from downloading custom content off the internet. Not all custom content is bad, but you never know when a virus might sneak in while you are downloading something. Also, downloading a lot of custom content will slow down your game, whether it has a virus or not.<br>  <br>  You can edit downloaded clothes, just like you can edit maxis clothes. It really has nothing to do with downloads.|`|MJtJM4xRaa	No, but the child porn you fap to does.<br>  Pedo.

Dso7k3sjaa	If you do NOT have any pregnant teens, then try pulling out your Downloads and Saved Sims folders to see if your sims can now go downtown or to any community lot.<br>  <br>  If they can, try putting just your Saved Sims folder back into your game and trying again.  If they still can, then you know it's something in your Downloads folder -- which is probably the case.<br>  <br>  Once you know that for sure, put the Downloads folder back into your game and the first thing you should do is use a program called the Hack Conflict Detection Utility to see if anything is conflicting with Inteen or Insim.  Although, read the files that come with Inteen about using that tool.  They actually recommend that you do use that tool, but I think I read once that sometimes it will claim one Inteen file is conflicting with another where, in reality, they aren't.  But read the file to know what I'm talking about.  If you don't have the file anymore, download your version of Inteen again, extract the files in a folder on your desktop and then read the rtf text files again that way.<br>  <br>  Anyway, there is another program that you should also download and use to have it check to see if there are any other hacks in your Downloads folder that you didn't put there on purpose yourself.  It's called the Sims2Pack CleanInstaller program.  When you click on the link I'm going to post, read the Welcome paragraph first, then read the FAQ and the Quick Start Guide so you will know how to use that program.<br>  <br>  Here's the link to get the Hack Conflict Detection Utility (HCDU) tool:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.simwardrobe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.simwardrobe.com/</a><br>  <br>  When there, click on Sims 2, then on Programs then scroll down just a little ways -- it's the second on the page.<br>  <br>  Here's the link to get the Sims2Pack CleanInstaller:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sims2pack.modthesims2.com/" rel="nofollow">http://sims2pack.modthesims2.com/</a>|`|8AsUtZeQaa	Save, quit and restart.

wvaN6zPZaa	From Easiest to Most Difficult:<br>  <br>  1. Fire Temple - probably the easiest based on the structure of the temple, the enemies running around, and Volvogia (final boss). There's nothing really difficult about the temple and could be completed rather quickly.. depending on how much time you take running around and exploring.<br>  <br>  2. Forest Temple - this is on the easier side of the difficulty scale. At first, I was a little wary because I had JUST turned into adult link. However, there aren't many difficult enemies in this level...except for maybe the Wallmasters who only appear in a single room. The poes and the final boss are easy to beat.<br>  <br>  3. Spirit Temple - this stage is for intermediate players. It is neither extremely hard or very easy. I actually really enjoy this temple. It's my favorite out of the five. Battling Twinrova is very fun.<br>  <br>  4. Shadow Temple - simply because the boss can be one of the hardest.. but then again it could be one of the easiest, depending on how familiar you are with the fight and how you strategize against him. The longer it takes you to fight this boss, the less chance you have.<br>  <br>  5. Water Temple - it is the MOST annoying and time-consuming of all the different temples. I hate how you constantly have to lift and lower the levels of the water. Morpha is also hard to fight because of the pool water on the stage.|`|Jt4BK8Cmaa	1. Forest Temple<br>  2. Fire Temple<br>  3. Water Temple<br>  4. Shadow Temple<br>  5. Spirit Temple<br>  the order i think is 35412 i think the water is the hardest because 4 floors, you have to move the water, and it is confusing|`|AfGJdYrxaa	well when you play the game, you have to play them in order. they will go form forest to water to fire to shadow to spirit.|`|72SKOByHaa	1.Fire Temple<br>  2.Forest Temple<br>  3.Spirit Temple<br>  4.Shadow Temple<br>  5.Water Temple|`|Oek3SiFWaa	lol you have them in the easiest to hardest order

IKD6HWTXaa	If you got to Battle Field website, there should be a patch you can download for it. <br>  Also make sure all your drivers on your computer are up to date. Especially your video card drivers. Go to your video card website and get the later and the greatest in drivers fro your model . Some times there is even a patch for a particular game if it is a common problem.
AA10726404	First off, no lottery in the world will make you a billionaire.  At least not in any currency where having a billion of it is especially impressive.<br>  <br>  And secondly, it would depend which lottery you were playing.  If you are talking one of the big two in America (Powerball and Mega Millions) the scary thing is that even if you purchased $400,000 tickets, you would not really have an amazing chance of winning.  The odds are now running at 195m-1.  So I'd say you would not even be getting a 0.5% chance of winning.  You'd invest your life savings for less than a 1 in 200 chance of winning.<br>  <br>  The other problem is logistics.  If you could purchase an average of 10 tickets a minute, it would still take you 28 days to buy all 400,000 tickets.  Clearly that would not be quick enough to get all the tickets in on a single draw, and that would lower your odds even more.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, few people are going to take such a huge risk with such a large sum of money.|`|X4Ot4OLmaa	one and five million chances|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Simple, let's talk hypothetically that this will give you 10% chance to win which is a huge boost in term of odds but still you have 90% chance to lose.  So, would you do it?  Of course not.  The whole idea of lottery is tobet small and win big, not bet big and go broke.  <br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Still wouldn't be great.  Not really worth it.<br>  <br>  If there are 14 Million combinations of numbers (depends on which lottery, of course), and you sold a house and bought 700,000 tickets, you still only have 5% of the combinations.

bF0EUesNaa	Depending on the error code, or the amount of rings (basically depending on what's wrong with it) you can fix it yourself.

3Nm1FOJ1aa	Hunters are easy mode. Warriors you will be a tank but you also have a lot of down time (eating food to regain health). Another plus of a hunter is aspect of cheetah which helps you get around if you can't afford a mount at level 30. Spec wise for hunters Beast Mastery is the way to go, pet does great damage and you should never pull aggro from your pet. So you won't ever get hit which means, no down time eating/drinking (Aspect of Viper-regains mana with every shot and increases your Mp5, but decreases damage a little)|`|AA11603810	uh.. put the game down.

EVjoCpjEaa	Supposing that you're already at Star Level 1, you will find the video games essences inside the cave (to the right of the train tracks).

DMC 1 3 4 all have so many good qualities, and I can't decide lol. Of course 2nd game sucks.<br>  <br>  But I'd have to say the 1st game. Cause it was what brought it to the spot light. How many games were there, that you could juggle puppet demons into the air with your sword over, and over? How many games started out with a guy getting impaled with a sword and electrocuted, by a woman who looked like his mom? <br>  <br>  I felt like I was in a middle of a movie while playing this game, and the cutscenes were quite different, for games back then. <br>  <br>  And for noticing small things... I never seen any other game so far "excluding RESIDENT EVIL which you just pressed a button for them to walk up or down the stairs" that when the character walked either up or down the stairs... you actaully saw his feet take steps. Usually you see that stupid floating on air kind of look when climbing stairs. Which sadly the later games did, but not a big deal at all lol. <br>  <br>  But I was amazed on how much work was put into this game. Every single environment was detailed to perfection. I still can't believe that this was orginaly planned to be the Resident Evil 4 game hah! <br>  <br>  Only downfall for this game would be it being too short!

Basically, once you are on the dashboard, press the Xbox button in the middle of your controller (the one you can use to turn on the xbox).  A menu will come up that you can pick friends or party, use the left thumbstick and go left to the Marketplace menu.  On that menu, there should be a redeem code selection.  Enter your code and then you will download the vehicle.  In order to activate the code in Halo Wars, you will need to pause the game with the start button actually during a game (campaign or skirmish), go to the Skulls choice and you can activate the wraith on that screen.

Games are not all as fun as of playing on the 360.<br>  online on the Ps3 is Crap compared to 360. Games for the Ps3 are okkayyy... not Great. would rather play on 360.<br>  But some of the best games for the Ps3 is God of War (Thats probably one of the funnest games i have ever played).<br>  Besides all that im going to be honest, i only use the Ps3 for the Blue-Ray now.<br>  <br>  But The positve side i love the blue-ray system in the console it was the best thing they did to it.<br>  Online is free. It may not be the best Gaming experience but its free.<br>  Quality of the picture is amazing. Much better than the 360.<br>  <br>  <br>  But it all comes down to what type of games you plan on playing.<br>  So its really up to you.<br>  Id go with the 360 (as you can tell). <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|ee569f9fc53b911e3456517551d307fdaa	360.<br>  <br>  In my opinion:<br>  If you want a gaming system, get a PC or a 360.<br>  If you want a multimedia system, get a PC.|`|vJ20fTZWaa	xbox 360 but just be careful with what you get him.

Just like real life economy. Or say if 10 people are trying to sell the same raw material. By time the 10th person puts his auctions up he will have undercut the first person's auction substantially so his materials sell quick.|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Nah. People are just to lazy to level their crafting skills and if your on an older server your server is flooded with people who have "experience" in making money which if you read any gold making guide consists of farming raw materials. The truth is it takes a lot of work to level a crafting skill but you can make more money off of it if you do it right. People are just lazy! They just want to mine and pick plants to make money (which it does) and thats what all the guides tell them too. I say if you want to make some serously gold from this pick up a crafting skill and use all these cheaper supplies to make better stuff and sell that. (if your level 80 and can get the mats). The prices on their stuff will continue to drop but if you can make good stuff your prices will increase. Another thing i've noticed is that on old servers the prices for low level herbs/ores etc are riduculous. I sold a stack of heavy leather for 40g! that's insane! but the higher level stuff is the same as it's always been<br>  <br>  But yeah overpopulated flooded dead servers :(<br>  I just switched to nesingwary for that very reason. Hopefully when it opens there will be an influx of good things|`|JWNzoksmaa	i don't know what server you play on (me Staghelm) but raw material prices have gone way up on our server.  Especially plant / flower prices b/c of inscription and those deck of cards for pvp.  I mean when you're paying close to 40g for a stack of goldthorn that's just ridiculous.|`|XNaEyYqtaa	Maybe its just the server you're on because on the one I play on prices are insanely high.|`|VbkJ9Tucaa	I agree with the server thing because my servers AH prices are absolutely ridiculous.|`|Yakgmg64aa	If that's happening its usually because of dumb asses who like to undercut people in the auction house to the point that they wont make barely any profit at all from the materials. For instance. Arctic furs on my server are going for about 50g. Some people decide they want to undercut me by going down to at least 25g, rather than going down only a few silver or copper and make 2 times the money. I Don't think that the real life economy has any impact on the wow economy. Even if the prices of raw materials are down on your server, they will probably go up. The only reason they would permenantly go down is if they materials became easier to get. Its all about supply and demand. The more of something there are, the less it costs. but the less there are, the more it costs|`|Jt4BK8Cmaa	as people say it matters what realm your playing on, its not people dumping raw materials its bots for companies to make money to sell for real money. If its real people then they are trying to compete with the gold farmers or to make them really mad( my bro sold one of his bags for 30g when they were selling it for 50g he got a letter complaining to him then he said whatever then the they lowered the price then he raised it to 55g)|`|A4EQUBKEaa	If you need help with WoW,a site here is good for you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.YehforGames.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.YehforGames.com</a><br>  Yeh! for Games, Inc. is an American company that helps you get levels and PvP gear on World of Warcraft.<br>  1.

xmulMOYraa	Ok my best answer for you is I believe you have to choose one or the other. I am a bs but I started it before WOTLK came out and I had to choose armor or weapon, either one is a pain to level. You can make both stuff just doing regular BS but the higher quality items I believe come from picking one or the other.|`|3Nm1FOJ1aa	Yes you have to choose to either be a weaponsmith or armorsmith. Depends if you want to have a decent weapon right off the bat or decent armor. My choice would be weapons, the crafted weapons are usually pretty good and will last you some time and it will give you time to save DKP and get your good gear then focus on getting a new weapon.
R0ZCgiutaa	basically you have to fly the plane with full 5 stars of speed until you get the trophy|`|hGAsJP4Maa	You have to fly faster than Mach 2 for an hour total in Campaign. Mach 2 is approximately 2,450 KPH (kilometers per hour; velocity units in HAWX), so several planes have the speed capacity to reach it. You should be able to just fly around in Free Mode with one of those planes for an hour and be set. I'm not entirely sure if doing it in Free Mode counts, but it is under Campaign, so it should. I just went to Single Missions and chose Adder (second mission) because you can fly around all you want as long as you don't near the Refinery Complex without worrying about any enemies appearing. I chose the YF-12A (Blackbird) for my plane (it has the best speed) and just flew around the perimiter of the map for around an hour. Hope this helps.
6GIrW5eWaa	COD information goes out on Thursday from the website www.callofduty.com/intel every Thursday they have released information for updates. Last week was the double exp (thank you) the week before it was the new makin day map and a patch. So look for the information to come out at the website on Thursday this week. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it is next week that we see the maps but not going to hold my breath. Good Luck<br>  <br>  Edit: 3/19 is the release date|`|sSDJLUzOaa	hopefully really soon its gonna be outrageous|`|zNkCX4Noaa	Daniel Suarez, executive producer for Call of Duty: World at War has said that they aim to bring out two or three map packs out, stating that the DLC will be different and ‘unusual’ to that which gamers received for CoD: Modern Warfare.<br>  In an interview with MTV Multiplayer he went on to say that the updates are ‘not going to be what we’ve done traditionally’ and that they are aiming to deliver something ‘mysterious’. This is sure to excite CoD players all over the world and spark off a speculation campaign.<br>  What we do know though is that the release of these maps were suppose to be released in stores and market at the beginning of the year. There were problems with the maps being incorporated. So i hope this helps, the release will be soon.. like within a couple months.|`|2Sbq3JNbaa	As far as I know "sometime" in March.

meMF69tXaa	I played the Sims 2 games for a solid year without cheats. Then, I got bored. The careers are not as important to me as having fun with my sims. I love to speed up the pregnancy with the cheats, I love to make the kids grow fast and see the expression on the sims family faces, I love to kill off the sims I hate, etc. Without cheats, I couldn't do this.<br>  <br>  I see your point, though.|`|ww59ahwYaa	I think you have a point.<br>  <br>  I have two files on for the serious game and the other for playing around with cheats.. I mean with cheats you get better clothes and players|`|CKcFzDwwaa	I agree with you.  When I don't use cheats on Sims 2, I get a feeling of pride when my family, who has worked for so long, moves up in their career (or moves into a bigger and better house).<br>  <br>  Although, like the others have said, I have one neighborhood where I don't cheat and one where I do.|`|hMj3EZfiaa	almost EVERY game is better without cheats (when I say almost I mean games with big head cheats and stuff like that) Its a whole lot harder though.I've never made a success ful family but I end up trying to turn them into vampires.|`|7Ca2ns47aa	I agree. I love making my sims make it "to the top" without using any cheats. However, I still use cheats when I'm trying to achieve a certain objective quickly or I'm just messin' around.
3Nm1FOJ1aa	Like the other 2 people said. Practice.<br>  Practice makes perfect.|`|3enLWKoEaa	practice practice practice<br>  better your BR and sniper<br>  learn spawns, tactics, jumps ect.<br>  and watch how the pros do it <br>  go to youtube and search MLG <br>  after you watch them play you can use their tactics to better yourself|`|ISoECQ2paa	Boosting is one option, although it's against the rules and will get you banned if you get caught. Piggybacking on your friends is another, play some matches with someone who is insanely good, fighting on your side.<br>  If you're a total loser, you can also resort to buying a high level account, people sell them all the time. This WILL get you ridiculed, though, as you'll face people who legitimately earned their 50's and will annihalate you each and every time.<br>  In my experience, the fastest and easiest playlists to rank up in are Team Doubles and Lone Wolves. <br>  The only REAL way to become a high ranking player though, is practice. Play a lot of games, Social Slayer and Multi-Team are always good practice. Take advantage of double-exp weekends to help get your exp higher. Watch videos of pro gamers, such as those MLG nerds. <br>  If you email me, stiqrog@yahoo.com, your gamertag, I can even get on and give you an evaluation, and throw you some pointers.

PlbAp6eNaa	Oblivion is a lot more challenging. But personally I would get fable 2 because it has a much better story line. Oblivion is more demanding on the computer graph./mem.|`|3Nm1FOJ1aa	Fable 1 would be the less graphic/cpu demanding game. Oblivion with graphics all the way up is pretty demanding.|`|WuhIoS1laa	Fable is less demanding of time and PC requirements, while still delivering a very satisfying story and plot. Get Fable: The Lost Chapters version.  Some of the optional 'boasts' that you can take with a mission for more renown are very challenging, but not necessary.<br>  <br>  Oblivion is a long game, with many quests, side quests and monster encounters.  You can really buff up your Oblivion experience with free downloads and add ons that enhance the game as well. I didn't have my game settings turned up until I'd upgraded my system. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure Fable 2 is even available on PC.

The newer the game is; however, the more you'll be able to sell it back for.<br>  If it's only a few months old, you might be able to get close to 20 or 30% of the original 60 dollar price back.<br>  <br>  For your gamecube games, you'll probably only get a dollar or two per game.<br>  You'd do better to try and trade them in towards another game.

I will vaguely touch on some of the different money making methods I have used if you would like more details on any one please feel free to contact me either in game or via yahoo.<br>  …1)Non combat skills<br>  ~Fishing~ Sharks, and monk fish, Fishing trawler for Manta ray and sea turtle you can even “free load” although this is unpopular with other players.<br>  ~Hunting~ polar kebbits, carnivorous chinchompas (stackable)<br>  ~Farming~ Grow Marigolds, ranarr, snapdragon, spirit weed and toadflax.<br>  ~rune crafting~ is almost always profitable (You can kill Banshee's for noted pure essence a lot faster than mining for it ) If your not high enough for laws or natures there are worlds where you can run these for others.<br>  ~Cooking~ Tuna Potatoes, curry stew, and pizza’s<br>  ~Thieving~ cave goblin wires from Dorgesh-kaan.<br>  ~construction~ Make Teletabs via Lectern in player owned house.<br>  ~Mining~ coal is slow but pays very well. If you are high enough Adamintite and Runite.<br>  …2) Using Combat<br>  ~Dragons using Melee or Range.<br>  Green dragons in the Wildy or in the chaos tunnels,<br>  Blue dragons in Edgeville dungeon, in ogre enclave and there is one in legends guild.<br>  Black dragons with 70+ ranged or Kill them with protect from Melee (this cuts into profit as your using prayer potions though this can be minimalized by using prayer saving armor)<br>  ~Chaos druids, Unicorns, Moss giants, Vampires, White wolves, Cockroaches, Jungle spiders, Iban Disciples and Avanasis are all good monsters to fight for profitable drops.<br>  *If you’re not interested in the prayer experience you can always kill and sell the bones. Ourg, Daganoth. Raurg, Fayrg and Dragon, sell best but even regular bones sell well.<br>  ** A fast way to big money is PKing but this is a risky endeavor. You can loose just as well as win. Remember there is always someone bigger and meaner than you... So you are liable to loose more money than you win. The more you risk the better your pay off its all on how gutsy you are.<br>  …3) Slayer~ In general Slayer monsters pay well. Consider the food you use an investment. Most assignments drops more than pay for the food needed to fight them. The possibility of receiving a rare drop makes them even more enticing.<br>  …4) Merchanting...watch the prices on the exchange then buy popular items when low and sell when high… There are several items you can buy in shops all over Runescape then sell for profit at the exchange, but as most of these are not stackable this can take several runs. Pineapples, seaweed, vials, bolts of cloth, Sacks, baskets, dyes, tinderboxes and Battlestaves are all examples of items that can be bought in stores all over Runescape and sold on the exchange for more.<br>  … 5) There are several quests that are well worth the effort.After doing the Throne of Miscellania (and Royal trouble) quests,You can get your kingdom workers to gather resources that can be sold. And if you do the Hand in sand quest you can get free sand daily.<br>  …6) You can collect Snape grass, Mort myre fungus, Planks, White berries, Potato cacti, Flax (Spin the flax into bowstrings for even more profit),Red spider eggs, Blue dragon scales, and Swamp tar. All these sell well.<br>  …7)Clue scrolls are a roll of the dice but they have the possibility of large large payoffs! Clue scrolls which are dropped by certain monsters more often then others... (I kill Daganoth’s with a cannon to get mine fast ) .<br>  … 8) You can hang out at the Falador drop room... I find wearing a ring of wealth helps (this is controversial)... it’s just up to luck what you can get and how fast you can get it.<br>  …9) One of the newest ways of making money is the recent Diversions and distractions addition... Penguin hunting can make as much as 97.5k a week and Shooting stars can give you 106 k a day in runes coins and ore.<br>  ….The thing is the game is designed to take time (which is why my answer is so long).. Your suppose to have to work for it. Jagex does a good job of making sure there are no quick ways to fast cash! I answer this same question for a lot of people, often they want to know which one is the best method. There is no best method. They are all good solid ways to try out and figure which one YOU like the best (my personal favorite is chaos druids)... remember the point of the game is to have fun. So find the one you like, sit back relax and enjoy!|`|9acbdc61db12cb3cbf26e8c330814491aa	well you could mine coal which sell for around 320gp each and are quick to mine with rune pick<br>  <br>  you could fish lobsters but this can be slow and I'm not sure you have a high enough level<br>  <br>  you could go cutting willows as these are really fast at Draynor and sell for about 40gp each|`|2zuiR2Byaa	Log off runescape and go outside, then maybe get an education so you can make real money.|`|JXs4BsTXaa	The quickest way to make money is either mining coal (which you can do at your mining lv) or get to lv 60 wc adn cut yews.

Zygor's is very popular in particular because it comes with a in-game mapping program.  Literally, you put it into your add-ons, sign in and it tells you step by step what the most efficient way to level is.  It puts a green dot on your mini-map to where you should go to solve any of the quests or to pick up quests. There's a little comment box with things like "he's the dude with the red hat" that questhelper and others don't have.  You can start using the guide at any level, any class and any race (although Horde and Alliance are separate guides).  <br>  <br>  I have not been happy at all with other written guides which say 'go to 53,67, pick up quest blah blah blah, go to 48, 76, kill blah blah'.  Quest Helper or Carbonite can do all of that for you.  A guide should tell you where to travel at what stage in the most efficient way possible. It also tells you where to grind and what to grind and how far to grind.  When to switch to a particular innkeeper, when to hearth and when to simply die and rez at a graveyard.  <br>  <br>  There are free ways of getting Zygor's Alliance and Horde including the programs.  I suppose I shouldn't tell you where they are openly here but I would start with file-sharing resources where anybody can put up their copy to share. If you'd like though, the others here have given solid advice.  Questhelper alone solves most people's issues and is free.|`|Jt4BK8Cmaa	actually you dont need to buy a guide, i think they are a scam why dont you just play the game yourself instead of buying a guide to tell you how to play?|`|t1yNBeo0aa	Don't buy a guide<br>  Look up James Leveling guide, it's free <br>  Gold: level 2 gathering professions|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	i dont care for guides like that at all.  i downloaded the quest helper addon and it leveled me faster than anything else i had been trying previously.<br>  <br>    plus any info you really need to know exists in free websites like wowhead and thotbot.|`|3Nm1FOJ1aa	1. You can find leveling guides for either Horde or Alliance without paying for them. Just gotta look harder. (If you are Alliance I can even send you one that I have).<br>  2. Gold making guides are a scam. If you are 80 the best thing is to become a mindr and herbalist. And zoom around on epic flyer picking/mining nodes. Fishing and cooking also helps alot as for high level fishes cooked properly will sell for 20-100g a stack.<br>  <br>  So I would say, save your money for your subscription and just level to 80 and get the right professions and you will be just fine.

SXi8jyqpaa	There are a lot of ways you can "hack" a map. I will only talk about my two favorite methods.<br>  <br>  One:<br>  (I always use this method.)<br>  Unprotect, then edit the map script in a text editor. The file is either war3map.j or scripts\war3map.j (if hidden). You can do anything you want in the map script, give yourself units with CreateUnit(), spawn random items every second with CreateItem(), increase your stats periodically with SetHeroStr(), SetHeroAgi(), and SetHeroInt(), activate quests with QuestSetEnabled(), unlock -saving in single player with EnableTrigger(), even give your hero new abilities, like permanent invisibility or 100x critical strike with UnitAddAbility().<br>  I usually add/change a few options in the war3mapMisc.txt file as well, just to make my hero move and attack faster.<br>  <br>  Two:<br>  (Beginners should stick to this method until they get better at programming in JASS.)<br>  Install a so called "cheat pack" and you will have access to ingame commands like: -gold -xp -lvl etc. Everything is described in the cheatpack's readme and by reading it's TriggerRegisterPlayerChatEvent() code block.<br>  <br>  p.s.: I never tried cheatpacks or played any maps that were hacked with a cheatpack, but from reading the code of many, I know that they are extremely easy to install and use. All you have to do is copy & paste some text into the right place (inside the map script).|`|Jt4BK8Cmaa	you cant you can edit them on world editor

cpLiNGUkaa	Use either Type 100 or MP40 with Bouncing Bettys, Stopping Power and Extreme Conditioning.

0Ead5iQSaa	None are connected. Just Final Fantasy X and X-2. But there is a story going around that Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy VII are now connected. There is talk about the life stream in FF X-2. So now they say that FF X came before FF VII. They say that the people of FF X leave the planet that they are from, and go the the planet of FF VII. That the story of FF VII happens hundreds of years after the story of FF X. The only thing the same in all the games are the summons, Chocobos, Cid, and Mogs. Except for FF XII. The names of the summons are all new, and the Mogs are rabbits not bears.|`|EXmnuJwPaa	Most of the games are not really related to each other. You could play them without having any knowledge of the others. However, there is a series of Final Fantasy VII games that correlate with each other. Crisis Core (PSP) is a prequel to the original FF7 (PSX). It fills up holes from FF7 and helps you understand FF7 better.<br>  <br>  There are also characters that make appearances throughout the series such as moogles and chocobos. Also, there is almost always a character named Cid who is usually an owner/creator/pilot of a ship. He is never the same exact character though. Also the names Bigs and Wedge (homage to Star Wars), appear in many of the FF games. <br>  <br>  All in all, the FF games are individual games that are not direct sequels or prequels of each other. They are independent of each other. (FFX-2, as you mention, was the first direct sequel.)|`|9poqDrd5aa	you dont know with Final fantasy, their have been both medieval and futuristic games real time strategy and turn based rpg, i think that other than ffx and x-2 they are all stand alone games, just recently enjoyed  Final Fantasy IV for my ds.|`|3rgJpqjZaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080227022808AAWrkp1">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

And that's only for 2 day shipping.|`|wSYYfBK4aa	No. Amazon uses the cheapest shipper they can find for their Amazon Prime shipping.  When I had Amazon Prime, I only got about half of my one-day shipping items on time.  I had packages lost, delayed, even had a shipper flat-out lie and say they delivered the package (Amazon sent me a new one two days later, and my original package finally showed up two days after that).<br>  <br>  Amazon Prime is a terrible waste. I'd rather use a reliable 3-day shipping from UPS than the shady unreliable 1-day shipping from the no-name companies that handle Amazon Prime shipments.

ca986effbf18b1196b22a5154e020d6aaa	In spite of people telling you that any individual number has an equal chance of being drawn you will never see 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 in a row in your life time when you are trying to pick several numbers from the same pool of numbers.  This is because there tends to be a BALANCE TO RANDOMNESS when multiple numbers are being picked from a pool of numbers.  If all you are trying to pick is one number out of 53 than yes, each individual one number has an equal chance of being chosen.  This all changes when you are trying to pick multiple random numbers out of the same pool of numbers. Out of, say, a pool of 53 numbers, you will see numbers somewhat spread out from 1 to 53 within the range of the numbers of the particular Lotto you are playing.  The major Lotto games have you choose five numbers with a separate mega number.   This being so, your 5 numbers should add up to around 150 to 165.  Add up the last 100 lotto results and see what the average totals are.  Pick your numbers to add up within that range.  As your mega number use the number that is the most frequently one picked from the stats given on the lotto website.  For the California Mega Lotto it is #36.  Or just use any mega number as this is the case where any one number is just as likely to be drawn as any other number.  Good Luck.|`|OyW8z4Jxaa	there is no good method if you are talking odds-wise.  each number is statistically equal to come up as any other.

HOdvH2c1aa	For your Skill Drain deck I rate 7/10<br>  <br>  My reasons<br>  <br>  The strategy is good but you should include some strong normal monsters with 1900 ATK or the 2000 ATK Gene-Warped Warwolf to make sure you can still have good monsters without Skill Drain.<br>  <br>  Also Skill Drain should be better protected with some more counter trap cards. Trap Reclamation would be useful as well.<br>  <br>  Another thing that should be corrected is the balance of your deck. I think that you should remove a couple of the monsters and put in some more spells. Fissure and Smashing ground would be a safe bet.

Anyway you can get it for under $10 at most crafts stores. It comes complete with a pair of knitting needles, a skein of yarn and a how to book that works very well with some videos on You Tube.<br>  <br>  If you go to You Tube and in search box put KNIT it will bring up the beginners how to videos. You can watch them over and over and make them fit with the little book.<br>  <br>  You need a pair of knitting needles about US 9 or 10, a skein of plain inexpensive knitting worsted yarn, and the will to sit there and knit the yarn up and "froggit" back out and roll into a ball over and over til you have it all worn out and are comfortable with how to knit. Then you can get some nice yarn and make a hat or scarf.|`|4SR4TTLiaa	The best way to learn to knit, in my opinion, is to sit down with an experienced knitter and learn from her. Buy some worsted weight yarn and a pair of #8 straight needles to embark on these lessons. Then after you have the hang of it in your hands and on your needles, you can look at printed sources. Good luck!|`|c8NJtkfRaa	You can watch videos online but I would suggest a live in person class.

It's only 50 nx (about 5 cents) but you still need the nxcash in your account to buy them.

xTioPxaVaa	I'm old school...if you can't get it done with 4 strings than you can't get it done!<br>  <br>  That said, if I were starting out today I'd say get a 5 string (I've got one now).  A lot of modern music makes use of those additional 5 notes!<br>  <br>  I would not recommend a 6 string bass for someone starting out.  The necks are usually very wide and difficult to get around on.  And unless you're playing some hardcore Jazz or Prog Rock, you probably don't need it.<br>  <br>  As long as we're on the subject of basses and string counts, there are others out there.  Some manufacturers make a 7 string bass, and the necks on those things are so wide I have to take a taxi from one side to the other;).<br>  <br>  I've also owned 8 and 12 string basses before.  The 8 string bass is the same concept as a 12 string guitar, each the strings are in pairs and tuned an octave apart.  <br>  <br>  The 12 string bass takes this further by using 4 sets of 3 strings!  You have the fundamental string, and then 2 additional strings tuned an octave up.  The most prominent users of this instrument would be Tom Petersson of Cheap Trick and dUg Pinnick of King's X.  Those instruments are wonderful in a power trio situation, but again are not recommended for a beginner (you've got to have some decent hand strength to play the 12).<br>  <br>  The most extreme bass I've personally seen was an 18 string bass that Tom Petersson had built.  It was the same concept as the 12, only based on an extended range 6 string bass.  That neck must have been 6 inches wide at some points!  After taking delivery of it, Tom found that he couldn't play it and wound up selling it to Allen Woody (1955-2000) of the Allman Brothers Band.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken
cLW7vFUGaa	The one-page "menu" that you're probably trying to open is just the map. For the complete menu, hold down the C button. As opposed to just tapping the C button, which opens up your rucksack, holding it down for a while opens the menu. You can then scroll through various information pages with the D-pad arrows, and there should be one where you can view your heart levels with both townspeople and animals.<br>  <br>  Also, if you visit the Town Hall (Waffle Town, then up the stairs to the Town Square) and go to Gill's window, you'll be able to see a complete villager list with a bio, likes, dislikes, AND current heart level.<br>  <br>  Hearts might take quite a while to raise - they require a lot of talking and gift-giving - so good luck getting them up!

AA10370707	This is a fairly simple skirt to make :) Here are step by step instructions and a list of materials:<br>  <br>  XL long sleeve men's dress shirt, any color<br>  2" wide elastic (get 1 yard just in case!)<br>  scissors<br>  sewing machine (duh. . .) :)<br>  <br>  1. Purchase an XL men's dress shirt with long sleeves.<br>  <br>  2. Lay the shirt flat on the floor, front up, and sleeves out to the sides. Cut the shirt off right under the armpit of the sleeves, and set the top aside for now.<br>  <br>  3. Now, turn the bottom of the shirt that you just cut off inside out. Next, fold the top of the tube down about two inches(a bit more, maybe about 2 1/4 inches for the seam allowance), as though you were rolling up a pair of jeans. This will be the tube where you put the elastic.<br>  <br>  4. Sew down the bottom edge of the tube you just made until you only have an opening large enough to insert your elastic.<br>  <br>  5. Insert the elastic, and sew the elastic shut (use a safety pin that is attached to the end of the elastic to insert it and work it around, the pin should be closed)<br>  <br>  6. Close your elastic opening.<br>  <br>  7. Now, cut the sleeves off of the top of the shirt. Turn one of them inside out. Once you have done this, place the inside out sleeve OVER the right side out sleeve. Line the seams up and stich around the raw edges of the sleeves where you just cut them off.<br>  <br>  8. Now, turn the tube that you just made right side out and iron it flat.<br>  <br>  9. To make belt loops, (note that they are large and airy) make a tube of fabric, that measures 3" long and 1 3/4" wide before being sewn. Turn these right side out, fold edges under, and attach them to your shirt.<br>  <br>  10. Congrats! You did it!<br>  <br>  Questions?

2RMNgZOyaa	I'll try to be someone to actually answer the question.  No there is no real code to make every wild pokemon female.  Legendary such as Palkia can not be male or female because they are one of a kind.  If you are looking to get another legendary there are was of cheating the game and exploiting clithces to get another one.  The only non-hacking method i know is to use the online trading center, there is a detailed method on gamefaqs.com.  But for any other pokemon you want another of just get a ditto (that pink thing) it will make a egg of any non-legendary pokemon male or female.<br>  <br>  If you need to get a hold of a ditto I would be willing to trade you one online. check me as best answer and i will send you my friend code|`|eMrov35Uaa	I don't think there is one. =/<br>  <br>  And you other people saying "go to youhavenolife.com and stopplayingpokemon.com" better shut up.

A question I pose is why are they even looking at a question about a game that they hate? I am 29 years old and I still enjoy Pokemon and cartoons and I feel no reason to hide it. Those people seem to only want recognition for what they say, and voicing their opinions doesn't make it a solid fact. It merely shows how prepubescent minded that they are. So to but it simply, my heart goes out to you for all these childish fools that don't seem to have anything to offer. So to take it down to a childish level that even they can understand, "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all!"|`|MumHXVM4aa	yeah there is. if you go to "youhavenolife.stopplayingpokemon.com" it will show you.

8e1f140936dd7a827f6f2be48b9a9545aa	Edna Bambrick was the name of an older age woman that often came to this site with every chance she had. Supposedly, she mostly came on to report any violations whatsoever on anyone she could. Likely, the reason why she done that is because she felt as if she was making the Internet safe. After a while, she became the most popular individual (celebrity) on this site because she was the most hated as well. Many people then tried to report on her with any reason[s] they could find whatsoever and probably succeeded in it. Yet, it didn't stop there, because her celebrity status continued on within the site, even though she might have been suspended from here. As a comical sense, some people thought it would be humorous to impersonate her on the site by creating screennames with her name as it, also her picture included as well. Not long after, it got out of control, because it sparked the 'Edna Phenomena', whereby many more users followed in-step by replicating the same antics as the original pranksters. This is when many 'Edna imposters'; sprung up all throughout the site, thus creating a cult. Yahoo! had taken the action by suspending as many suspicious Yahoo! Answers accounts that was the sole intent of impersonating Edna. <br>  <br>  That is all I know about the whole phenomena from seeing other's posts from time to time.|`|3f25405bb54b8bd96bea8fb3b619327caa	Edna is dead now --I think!

RDUif0mbaa	since you are gonna need it for outside, i would recommend a strong glue mixture, like aleene's tacky glue mixed with a bit of water, or if you can find an even stronger glue, i would try that...|`|gJnXb9NIaa	I have used equal parts elmer's glue and water and mixed them together and put the mixture in a spray bottle. This has worked nicely to stiffen fabrics that I use for craft projects. Hope this helps.
