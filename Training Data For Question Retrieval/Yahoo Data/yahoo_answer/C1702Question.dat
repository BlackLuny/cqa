20090203062134AAb3zS5	News & Events;Current Events	Why do the Americans on here defend Michael Phelps' pot smoking?	it's an absolute disgrace and an embarrassment to America. Why are they not disowning this idiot? 14 medals or not, he's a chav.       Was he ever drug tested at the Olympics??
20090219165417AA0u9XD	News & Events;Current Events	Why is it so controversial that Michael Phelps was caught smoking weed?	...to the point where Kellogg's dropped their sponsorship. Did everyone forget he was convicted of drunk driving in 2004.       Is putting innocent lives in danger by getting behind the wheel while intoxicated a less harmful example for kids than being stoned in the comfort of one's own home?

20090203063931AARdiiO	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Britain very rarely needs anti severe weather equipment, so why do BBC announcers sneer at the UK?	Britain invented the rail system, electrified points are simple technology easily installed but very expensive if used only once in !0 years. Similarly anti freeze-up equipment in British airports is easily installed but costs billions. So why do moronic BBC news people do Britain down with statements like "We are the laughing stock of the World"?  because we have not so far installed ￡20 billion worth of equipment to use once in about 10 years. Britain is normally warmer than much of Europe due to the Gulf Stream, do the anti British BBC people not know this?

Ben 10, Kim Possible, Spongebob and many more.   I love the response,    "I'ts on for the kids" when in fact the 'kids' are busy doing something else and the man is glued to the TV screen.      Is this ALL men, or just the ones that I know?

I don't think she deserves ANY money just for having 8 children, making her the mother of 14.   Millions of women have multiples every day,   and they don't get paid for it.   I'm really sick of hearing about her.   I don't think the Duggars should have a TV show, if you were to bring that into question, either.

Therefore they have the right to expel non Jews i.e. Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, etc. etc as they have been doing so for the last sixty years with the assistance of the so called Christian USA, UK, Australia, … .   3. “We are the chosen people of God”.   4. “We are the master race …. .”   More evidence:   First Jewish colony in Palestine, 1878     http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/MA...    to   Camp David Conspiracy    http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/MA...

20090220092535AAU67Iz	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Has anyone read any articles about the Muslim News show with the purpose to restore Muslim perception to US?	NBC & Fox News had given him good review for attempting to put Muslims in a positive light.   But now he has just beheaded his wife and the media is afraid to write anything about this.   If a Christian Minister in the News beheaded his wife, it would be all over in the media.      Why isn't this brought out in the open?      Also about 2yrs ago when a Muslim father in Texas (from Egypt) killed his two daughters for changing clothes at school & talking to American boys on the phone. The news didn't say much about this, but he escaped with help from his Muslim brothers. So he is still on the run.      This might be Egyptian culture, but it isn't American culture. In America, it is murder & should be reported as such.      What is American media afraid of?

I feel a ceasefire at this point is time is very much needed, if not it is going to be a never ending war and hpefully India instead of encouraging the war on the LTTE and aiding sri lankan Govt they will urge sri lanka for a ceasefire at least for the sake being called a    "south asian Giant "   very typicall of the tamil tigers in the way they reacted, between, all these while the sinhalese govt were killing and burning women and innocent civilians, but the ltte have fought with the airforce, respects to that attitude , unlike the sri lankan forces they didnt kill the civilians

What I know is this: that if we see a nuclear arms race in a region as volatile as the Middle East, everybody will be in danger. And one of my goals is to prevent nuclear proliferation generally, I think that it's important for the United States in concert with Russia to lead the way on this, and I've mentioned this in conversations with the Russian president, Mr. Medvedev, to let him know that it is important for us to restart the conversations about how we can start reducing our nuclear arsenals in an effective way, so that we then have the standing to go to other countries to start stitching back together the nonproliferation treaties that frankly have been weakened over the last several years."
