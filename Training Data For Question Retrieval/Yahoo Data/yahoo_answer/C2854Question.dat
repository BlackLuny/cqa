20090226112951AA62Bd4	Dining Out;United States;Other - US Dining Out	Why? Topless cafe in Maine?	Why does everything have to revolve around sex and nudity, I find this offensive and disgusting, if I lived in Maine I sure the heck would not go there, I see this as just another way for woman to degrade themselves. Why do woman like to disrespect themselves and be nothing but sex symbols for the perverted men out there? And what is wrong with the city for allowing this? Like we don't have enough nudity shoved in our faces every day.

I live in the UES and we are going to see a band play at Arlene's Grocery in the LES.  I suggested Stanton Social to them, but when they looked at the menu they thought it was too pricey and trendy for them.  So I am looking for a simple menu (sandwiches, salads) with a GOOD beer list in the UES or LES.  Suggestions?
