He has done the quads and dirt bikes, but wants to start doing freestyle tricks on a BMX style bike.  For those of you that do this all the time...what would be a good bike for someone to start learning how to do tricks and stunts on.  One that is not too expensive as I know it will be trashed in no time, but one that is still a great bike to learn  tricks on.  Any help from you guys would be great.   No nasty comments....I am a thirty something mom that supports her kid doing sports and things like this rather than running the streets and being a thug, so save the nasty comments.  All others I appreciate any help you can offer.

20090305122124AApFFsH	Sports;Other - Sports	Perfect Sports Betting Strategy?	This question relates to sports betting. This is what you do.. you take the underdog with the spread...then, with someone else, in the same, you take the favorite but don't give a spread. Using this system you cannot lose, only win. For example..      Denver vs Portland...Denver is the underdog, and gets 7 points      You take $10 on Denver with the 7 point spread.   With someone else, you take $10 on Portland, but without giving a spread.      If Denver wins by any amount, you win that bet...   If Portland wins by more than 7, you win that bet...   In both these cases you are winning one and losing the other which cancels your bets.      BUT, IF PORTLAND WINS WITHIN 7 POINTS, YOU WIN BOTH BETS...GIVING YOU $20, WHILE THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN IS TYING.      Does anyone see any flaws in this system which will cause someone to lose money? Also, what do you guy think..

I thought wrestling was pretty cool, i could tell it takes alot of athletic ability to do what they do. But, i downloaded some matches from onl ya few years ago (such as HHH vs HBK from bad blood 2004) and wrestling used to be SOOO much better. The storylines now are repetitive, and the matches are all the same. Look at the tag team matches, one team (usually the heel) is winning most of the time, then the other team makes a tag and that guy kicks every1s butt and they win. Vince really needs to make wrestling bettter, or he is gona lose one viewer a week (and with WWE's ratings, i think this might put it off the air)

20070522071259AA6HD8r	Sports;Basketball	Should the Pacers dump O'Neal and rebuild?	JO can opt out of his contract at the end of 07/08.  I doubt he will, but if he is still here he might just do that to play for a contender.  whether or not he dumps 44 million over two years the Pacers have a decisons to make.  Will patch work tranactions bring us back to contending status in a weak conference?  Or will trading our franchise player rebuild this team to compete with the Bulls, Raps, and Magic of the future?  JO will never, in my eyes, be a successful franchise player.  He gets paid top 10 money but he is clearly not a top 10 player.  There are a lot of desparate teams out there looking to validate their own franchise player's contracts so the Pacers would have offers.  Lakers, Knicks, Celtics, and Timberwolves are among the many possible destinations for a player like JO or Gasol.  I for one would like to package a bad contract with JO (Tinsley or Murphy) and get cap relief first (need that for Granger's, William's, and Diogu's contract) draft picks, and one prospect.

20081103164859AA7YZQr	Sports;Football (Soccer);Women's Premiere Leagues	Should I play soccer?	I'm a Junior in highschool, [16 years old] and I've played sports all my life. I've been playing softball and basketball since I was 5, and volleyball since I was 9. I gave up basketball when I was 13 because I didn't like the sport anymore.  [I'm telling you this to let you know that I'm athletic. lol]      Now I tried out for soccer today. I've never ever played soccer, but it looked pretty fun, and I figured all the running would get me in better shape for softball season. The thing is that, I'm not a very good runner. I'm 5'8", tall I know- but I'm pretty slow..   Today at tryouts the coach put me as goalie, and I caught everything that came to me, lol. But I don't have the fastest reflexes, so I didn't do that great..   Then we ran a mile, and I kept up with most of the other girls for the most part.       I know that if I play I won't be starting any time soon, but I was wondering for your opinon. Do you think I should continue this sport?   If you play soccer, are there any litle drills or something I should do around my house to help my footwork a little more.      Thanks.
