The Voyager has exceptional speakers for music and talking on the phone.  2 reason? It has a full keyboard AND a touch screen pad on the opposite side. So if i do get sick of touch screen, which you will too, you could switch to the keyboard. You cant do that on the Dare. I would recommend going into your local Verizon store though, where you can test and try the pphones there.    Hope this helps :)

You can always go to www.download.com and put a search of mp4 converter in there, and chose the free ones too.

kmQRtw30aa	To record TV you will need the PlayTV add on. It includes a dual digital terrestrial tuner so you can record one digital TV channel while watching another. It lets you pause live TV too. You can set timed recordings or use the 7 day electronic program guide to record programs in the future. Even if you are watching another channel, playing a game or have your PS3 in standby mode it will automatically wake up and record scheduled programmes in the background. All of your recordings are available inside the PlayTV software or you can export them as mpeg2 video files to copy to your PC or whatever.  If you have a PSP it can talk to your PS3 remotely to watch live TV or recorded programmes anywhere you have access to a wireless network.  It's RRP is 69.99 but Play.com currently sell it for 49.99, and GAME and Gamestation sell it for 59.99    The UK PS3 is region locked for DVD playback (Region 2).

HekFanRvaa	In my opinion, if I were to buy it, I would only get the console becasue I dont play any of the games that you listed down except for GH3 and fight night 3 for PS2. I would say, $200 for the console package (incl. cables and the sixaxis controller because it's a standard package) because it's a 2 year old console without Sony warranty anymore. You couldnt say your PS3 is slightly used with all the games that you had for the past 2 years. You cannot sell it at $500 just because it comes with al your games... thing is, everyone has their own game preference and I am not gonna pay for your games because I don't like them.    Just sell the console and sell your games to gamestop or other game store. You can't force people to pay for the games they don't like. Esp PS one? why am I gonna play PS1 games if I already have PS3? I wouldn't get an expensive PS3 console if I am just gonna play PS1 games.    I'm not gonna buy it, I'm just saying you couldn't sell it all together at $500.    Consider my thoughts.    Cheers!|`|ZYMjsGSJaa	About $350, but yeah what that one guy said sell your games separate|`|ppMp9mcPaa	ide think about selling games seperatly|`|ade9dad211741588afecb28694282487aa	I would not mind the PS1 games I can't find hardly any around here.

I like the BBC even though I am angry at them for this DEC business|`|AA11366224	It's mainly a historic legacy.  Originally there was a levy on the sales of radios that went to the BBC so that there was something to listen to.  Once everyone had a radio, the revenue dried up (things were built to last in the 1920s) so they brought in an annual licence to pay for the BBC.  When television arrived, they brought in a higher licence fee.  More recently, there were so few people with only radio that they abolished the radio licence.    Commercial TV is funded by advertising.  Every so often, the formula doesn't work which is why Channel 4 are currently in difficulties.  Sky has both a subscription and advertising, but no-one seems to mind.  They'll happily shell out money to keep my friend Rupert Murdoch in castles and yachts, but they whinge at paying a subscription to the BBC.|`|I8ZpZSCGaa	In the South of Ireland and the UK all televisions must be licensed by law regardless if you even have an Ariel or receive any Channel's.

b8Byuji8aa	Yeah, it can be done. But the channel being watched on all the TVs will be the one that the box is set to display. That is, all TVs will be watching the same channel. If that's what you really want, then a splitter (for whatever type of cabling used to connect the box to the TVs) is all you need.
STUsNoNTaa	Is the tv under warranty? if so contact the place you brought it if not do you have contents insurance that covers accidental damage to tvs and hifis if you do I would spill cola or orange juice down the set and over the back and claim against it as the repair bill could be expensive, the excess on your insurance would probably be cheaper you get a new set with warranty and peace of mind

It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $315 at amazon.com.    Here's an actual handheld picture of the moon:    http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...

Anyone in their right mind and who knows about photogaphy wouldn't have said that. Worst camera around. A plastic toy if you like.     A lot depends on what sort of budget you have.  Possibly the best entry level DSLR at the moment has to be the Pentax K-m which you can get for about 350 if you look around.  10.2mp. Anti shake built into the body. Best dynamic range around. Metal chassis. Water and dust seals.

Your better off getting the new 120GB classic though... it is a big big improvement on the old model (i have one)    It is possible... but you would have to take out the HDD from the video (how i have no idea)... check the model and dimensions... then shop around...

Flash memory is used and that is alot more difficult due to the limitations placed on the firmware.     Im guessing you are talking about the classic ipod so in essence, if you can contact the supplier of the hdd, you may just get what you want with a simple swap. Though I would check around on forums to see if it has already been done.     Theoretically it should work, physically i wouldnt recommend it. Use google.
d4fa959eaf2187f78493d6400d9a9302aa	John makes a good point about 1080p only mattering if its 42" or bigger, but he leaves out the most important factor: VIEWING DISTANCE. Whether or not 720p or 1080p makes a difference is determined by your VIEWING DISTANCE. To even see the 1080p effect you must sit within these distances of these TV's:    40" must sit within 5 feet  42" must sit within 6 feet  50" must sit within 7 feet  65" (my TV) must sit within 13 feet    so as you can see, if you want to buy a 42", there is NO POINT in buying 1080p unless you will be sitting within 6 feet of the TV. I have lots of flexibility because my TV is 65". Go big if you go 1080p, its that simple. Otherwise, its a scam.|`|IJJW2zPzaa	I just went through this dilemma myself. It is really quite simple. 1080P only becomes a factor when you are talking about larger screens, 42"+. There is no difference in picture quality between 720P and 1080P on a television smaller than 42". 1080P was simply last seasons innovative selling point. Even on the larger screens, unless you have a Blu-Ray player, 1080P is currently worthless. The best HD programming only comes in 720P.    This year's new innovative selling point is 120hz., as opposed to 60hz. on LCD's. I would not worry about this either unless you're planning on putting this television in your common area. This simply is a new technology dealing with how often the screen refreshes. It prevents the pixelation that you see in sports, or other fast moving action scenes on an LCD.    I recently bought a Panasonic plasma 42" and have been extremely happy. The below link should also help you in making your decision. I hope this helps!|`|HxcTuTSQaa	720p TV Sets display 720 lines, 1080p TV Sets display 1080 lines.

Generally speaking my LG phones did not last as long as the Samsung phone I had or the Blackberry I have. It also depends on how you take care of it. I was younger when I had the LG phones, that could have something to do with it. http://www.myphonedied.com|`|n8plhpdDaa	big the Wireless Company has NOTHING to do with the manufacturer of phones. That would be the all about motorola, LG, Samsung, Sanyo, Pantech .. only to start the list they make the phones and the Wireless Companies buy them often still at wholesale pricing and take a hit to sell them to you at the discounted or subsidized rate, it takes the wireless company about 18-24 months for them to recoup what they laid out for you to get that phone at a discounted rate before they start to make money off you.  So if your gonna complain.. lets go right to the source!!!!! The phone manufacturer!

Just about the only thing that hasn’t changed is the name. In 2GB, 4GB, and 8GB models starting at $149, iPod nano puts up to 2,000 songs in your pocket.(1)<br>  <br>   <br>  Look like a rock star<br>  Your music says a lot about you. So should your iPod nano. A super-slim design says you always have room for music — up to 2,000 songs, in fact. Durable anodized aluminum says you won’t let the rough and tumble of everyday life ruin your groove. And one of five colors says whatever you want. Choose your hue and make a statement.<br>  <br>    <br>  Carry a tune (or 2,000)<br>  Choose a 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB iPod nano and add a soundtrack to your life. Just use iTunes to import your CDs, shop for 99￠ songs on the iTunes Store, then sync them to iPod nano. Possibly the world’s coolest photo album, iPod nano holds up to 25,000 snapshots.(2) iPod nano plays audiobooks and podcasts from the iTunes Store, too.<br>  <br>  Play more encores<br>   <br>  Imagine what you could do in a day. Fly around the world. Watch two sunsets. Listen to your iPod nano. Up to 24 hours of battery life(3) means the hits just keep on coming. Whether you’re exercising, commuting, or rocking a road trip, iPod nano may just outplay you.<br>  <br>   <br>  Light up the stage<br>  While it can't stop the rain, iPod nano might make your day a bit brighter. 40% brighter, to be exact. Album art pops and slideshows stun on the iPod nano’s dazzling display. That means everything looks as good as it sounds.<br>  <br>   <br>  Go on tour<br>  Add accessories and your music stays with you at home and on the go. Of course, iPod nano itself makes a great accessory. Wear up to 2,000 songs around your neck. Run with up to five days of skip-free music on your arm. Get an iPod nano to match your Nike+ shoes. iPod nano is the new black (and pink and blue and green and silver).<br>  <br>  <br>  THATS WHAT IT SAYS ON THE WEBSITE UNDER IPOD NANO. <br>  i have a nano, but its not a new one, and i to have realized that it says music videos on my playlists, but i think its only because your software is updated .. and on the ipod video they have the same software so they have to put music videos on there.|`|AA11477259	no, ipod videos do though|`|ce1386647919a7a34100b52d5544c334aa	Not the ones my friends have i have a video but no i don't believe that you can play ANY video on a nano
qGfAlDd2aa	It all comes down to signal strength over your house, which is a pretty individual thing.  The only time I have seen someone need an attenuator is when they are within a few miles and are using a directional outdoor antenna.    If you are really close, you may be able to get by with an indoor antenna (rabbit ears).  If you run into the situation where rabbit ears work and the outdoor antenna doesn't, then you probably need an attenuator.  You could also not aim the antenna directly at the the transmitters; that would decrease the signal somewhat.

iheRlxhdaa	No.  It won't work, because Sprint and AT&T are using two different technologies.      To put it short, AT&T phones use GSM (simcards) and Sprint uses CDMA (no simcards).      Unlocked phones are mainly used on GSM networks, where you can switch simcards freely.  There ARE unlocked CDMA phones, but they must be flashed to the other CDMA network first (e.g. Verizon).  Flashing CDMA phones can be both difficult and expensive.|`|oMgw8M4aaa	Yes is should be ok because both at&t and sprint are under a gsm network and an iphone is a gsm compatible phone but just to be safe check with your sprint carrior.

xQjToANXaa	The wii fit is great. I don't know why some people saying it is not worth, unless they don't like to be active.   I have had one one for about 2 months now and the whole family is using it. You can either play the games just for fun and still be active or you can use it for a full work out and keep track of your weight and set goals.   I have lost 8 lbs on it and that was from using it 30- 40 minutes a day for about a month. I do aerobics exercises, muscle conditioning and yoga poses. If you set it up like a regular work out you will sweat and lose weight. Kids do fun activities, such as ski jumping and heading footballs that challenge the player's overall body balance?  If you use it correctly there is no way that you wouldn't feel it working. Especially the boxing and hula hoop.You can also do running, push ups, etc.   I think it is a great motivational game and good for if you can't get to a gym or go outside, and the kids' do all the exercises as well as the games.  http://www.blueunplugged.com/p.aspx?p=12...|`|jALife8Faa	I think its well worth it.

As was brought out- it's not just for exercising- you can use the board for other great games- like Shawn White Snowboarding, or Ravin Rabbids.  trust me- you wont be disappointed with the Wii Fit!|`|URncTuxxaa	It's fun for a bit, but it can get boring after a while.|`|jhFT5kT1aa	yes you should it is a beast game  i actually get sore when i do the push up thing and stuff  it is really cool/fun    get it!!!|`|I7abycl2aa	I have a wiifit after a week and a half of 45 minutes exercise on it a day I had lost 2.3kg it's fun:)|`|HmAYw6W5aa	well I have it and I find it quite good.|`|fvUAYU7xaa	i went on my cousins Wii fit and its boring to me.  Its a waste of money.|`|e4984fff739610fd75449d66ba5516a1aa	You would get fitter by buying trainers and a tracksuit and going out jogging.|`|zYGJh5Odaa	u should tootally get a wii fit its fun and energetic.|`|IdeXYegLaa	You should get the wii fit it's fun and gets you in shape you can set your own weight goal so you know what your working towards it also helps improve your balance it's lots of fun and games.|`|bMWXqdScaa	depends on what u are expecting.  i would say no, it would be better to actually go outside and exercise yourself.  Plus you have my fitness coach and i am willing to bet that that is better.  The only upsides to wii fit are that you can see you mii exercising and that it does make exercising fun (for about the first week).  I have wii fit and i think that it is not worth it.  wait for wii sports arena (i forget what it is called, but it is the sequel to wii sports)|`|HeZorcNWaa	Half my female mates are shelling out hundreds for wii fit. Most of them weigh more than me. I don't have a wii fit. Call my old fashioned, but I just walk places, exercise and eat well.     I think its just a company's way of exploiting women's weight fears. It is free to exercise.. People all over the world are starving to death, walking miles to find clean water etc. Give the money to charity if you don't need it and start exercising.     This ain't a rant at you personally...just so tired of all this stuff.     It is your choice whether you buy one, but personally I think there's much more productive things to spend money on.|`|8SjpwLNSaa	I think Wii Fit is great! I got it for my birthday last year and have been on all the activities and exercises. There are fun ways of getting your heart going for example virtual hula-hooping and boxing and also fun balance games for example a game where you're a penguin trying to catch fish on an ice burg lol. There is also yoga and muscle exercises and jogging and stuff. It'll give you hours of fun, keeps you fit and you can keep an eye on weight and body condition with the daily body test.|`|DQj4LxhZaa	Yes the wii fit is a very good game and i would recomend it to you. However games such as raman raving rabbids tv party, a skiing game and my fitness coach also use the balance board. I would say that the wii fit although being good is very limited and has only a few different games. you would be much better off geting raman raving rabids tv party as this is one of the best wii games
JbDfdJb8aa	The trick is to find out where the save files are going. Many of the big games store their save files in My Documents. Others have the files in the program folder. I would just find the folder, and when the game is re-installed just copy the content of that folder to replace the new one.

AA11877492	LCDs have very light weight plastic screens, like your RCA, and are easily damaged - as you found out. Plasma screen sets (no quality until 42") are much more durable.   Just mounting your TV on the wall may not be an answer, as the screen height, for comfortable viewing, should be set so that, when you are seated, your eye level is somewhere in the bottom 1/3 of the screen. You might also try the old fashion glass screen 4:3 CRT if you just need rugged.  It is also possible to get a large piece of thick, clear plastic and make a screen cover/protector.|`|be319bc66b76704553186682baed7c9aaa	u can have LCD tv wall fited,  R  if its not possible u can go 4 normal CRT|`|WxKUwcu5aa	one you can put on the wall my friend has a son with autism and thats what she did

But if your looking for ALOT of music storage you probably will need a Ipod Classic because i hold 120 GB of songs  because the Iphone and Ipod touch both only have limited space. 16 and 32 GB  But if you ask me the best ipod was the Ipod Video 80 gig.|`|KsqnIXcTaa	I have an iPhone and iPod touch amongst others. I'd depends on what you want to use it for. The iPhone is only 16gb whereas you can get iPods with bigger storage. I suggest the new iPod touch if you just want an iPod. It has all the features of the iphone. If you need a new phone then get the iPhone. It's alot of money to spend if you don't need a phone. Hope that helped!
iheRlxhdaa	Actually, his Omnia would be unlocked!  AT&T doesn't offer the Omnia, so he probably ordered/bought it from and online import store.

Gem96NQyaa	It depends on where you live.  Discounts are entirely up to the local liquidation staff.  My local one only had a 15% discount last Saturday (10% on big ticket items), and they'd marked everything up before the sale started, so it's really more like a 5% discount.  If you want a decent deal on anything, you're going to have to wait a few more weeks and pick through the leftovers.|`|oeCIzoF9aa	Yes, as of now they're selling everything at 30% off in the US.  But later they should have like a 50% off, then 70% off when they get close to selling everything.  Of course, by then all of the good stuff will be gone.  So, yes buy the CPU, it should be a great deal.|`|wQiGnJepaa	I wouldn't travel any great distance looking for bargains there. The deals are generally poor.

wScYLSkwaa	I have the game Trauma Center: New Blood. I think it's a fun game. It's a surgery game. It has one or two players option. Two players will get the surgery done faster before the time runs out. As you accomplished a series of surgeries, it will become harder. The good thing about the game is that if you failed a surgery, you will be able to do it again and again until you succeed. This game does have blood and you will be actually cutting a person's body open which might gross you or your family members or friends. I don't think it is really that bad, anyway.    I think you would also like the game called Animal Crossing. You have your own house, you can buy clothes, furniture's, talk with your animal friends, and you could even visit other person's Animal Crossing town via Wi Fi connection.|`|nPlONqnPaa	That game is not very fun. Its only worth is the use of the Wii mote but after you get past that, its very repetitive. You should get either World Tour, Twilight Princess or Brawl. Okami is very much like Twilight Princess, but i prefer Twilight Princess because of its history. World Tour is my top 5 current favorite games because im a gh fanatic. Brawl is just a great game but if you liked Melee, dont buy it.

sr78Xlm6aa	if you install any good virus protection program i.e. avg antivirus or search and destroy then you will be protected from any viruses you might get from limewire (i have downloaded 157 songs and only got 1 minor virus that i patched up right then and there...my computer even told me i needed to fix it)    also you can try http://www.qtracks.com  or it might be http://www.qtrax.com|`|RpQfIQXmaa	There are many music download sites and software, but the best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: http://www.nexusradio.com    It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.    I have been using it for over a year without any problems.    PS: Never use limeWire, FrostWire, or BearShare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!    -----by music king!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0fd84ba056353594be65eb4771d885ebaa	yep ure screwed|`|VbAm6N59aa	iTunes has downgraded their prices. You can get CD's from your friends and copy them to your iPod.|`|U6qB7HG5aa	Its better if u always buy the albums on cds and dvds since u always have a copy with u for emergency and it has no limit on how many ipod u can share that on. U can trade with ur friends and get some cds from them . The music selling part of itunes suck due to this. Also the cds are mostly the same price as that of itunes. U cannot copy and keep songs downloaded from itunes.|`|0vcOjNwiaa	Yeah that is a lot of money but I would assume that you aren't going to buy 1000 songs at one time. Besides, music has always cost money unless you are listening to the radio. Be glad that we no longer have to pay $18 for a cd... especially if we just want 2 songs from it!|`|UOz1LPIHaa	Yes, music can get expensive.  That's why you don't even bother trying to fill up an 80GB player with music, generally.    Two words:  podcasts and audiobooks.  Most podcasts are free, and some audiobooks are as well depending on what you like, if your local library's like mine and has some for "check-out", etc.  That's how you're supposed to use all that space. . . don't expect it to be all music.    It's also a lot easier to fill up a player if you're from the CD generation and therefore have a bunch of those ripped onto your computer.  Be thankful you don't have to buy a whole CD (probably $15-$20) just to get 2-3 songs you actually like and a bunch of others that are so-so to annoying like we used to most of the time.

XYOYml59aa	Have you turned the phone off?   I have had a simular issue with an older phone (years ago). Basically I message was recived but not completely, so the phone knew about it, but wouldn't show it.   You may have something like that.

fwdsp3dVaa	Don't bother with the hz!!!    Go with a LCD with the highest contrast ratio(10,000 to 1) or more with a fast response time(4ms is the fastest nowadays)!    However, at 42" or larger i highly recommend going with a Panasonic or Pioneer Plasma HDTV. They have the  1 &  2 best picture qualities of the HDTV world with 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio's and 480hz refresh rates!    A lot of people on this website still believe that LCD is the ONLY option for HDTV's...but that's not always the case! If you're getting a TV 40" or smaller, then yes, go with a LCD. But larger then 42"...Plasma...always!|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	You could spend more money on a better LCD.    Or you can buy a new 2009 model plasma and not worry about all this stuff.    A new panasonic plasma has 480hz.    Has no lag time, actually it's so low (under 1 millisecond) that they don't bother to list it.    The native contrast ratio will always be better. LCD uses dynamic a lot to give the illusion of better contrast.    All plasmas have a wider color gamut    Plasmas have no issues with color or light shifting when viewed off angle.    Burn in on 2009 models and beyond is not really the issue it was in the past.    Plasma is cheaper per inch than LCD.    Or you can listen to the Plasma haters that claim the plasma burns up in a year and other nonsense, but can't ever give a credible source.    I'm not an LCD hater, they can give a good pic, they are reliable, but I don't care to deal with their issues when plasma exists.    Look for a deal on this Plasma, no LCD in the same price range can touch it. http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...    Good luck|`|sER6UGMWaa	Let me break this down for you Joey.....  These people have absoluety no idea what there talking about...  First of all stop looking for an LCD your better going plasma..it has an overall better picture quality than the LCD.. you prolli walked into the store and seen the brightest image and feel in love with it...well ill tell you this there all set right out of the box to catch your eye...    The 120HZ is a fuc**** joke because nothing on the face of the earth is broadcasted  in 120 due to the fact that in order to get that frame rate an image would have to be recored and played back and looped twice and slowed down in order to double a frame and not see any blur or judder..do the research Samsung was the first company to do it and it failed the first year.... alot of returns Model LNT4061F it made the image look like its movin in slow motion... these newer model 6 series 7series up to the 9 series have it yes they did fix the slowmotion portion of it now it causes a halo and a judder in your image..     now if you got a plasma they dont operate off a refresh rate or frame rate becuase there gassed they react alot quicker to action than LCD's    you might see panasonic advertise 480hz.. they only said that because the LCD would never catch up to it EVER!!!!    And as far a contrast ratio lol... this is the good one... i always get this...why does this contrast higher than this one and the one with the lower contrast looks better... or whats pioneers contrast?     Contrast is a joke as well... started with the lcd because there blacks were and still not as good as plasmas... now different manufacters weigh there contrast differently. some weigh it by the white levels samsung thats y they say a million to 1 some weight it by greyscale   some weight it by black levels theres not telling ... so you cant take that in to consideration unless you narrowed it down to one brand and technology...THIS IS WHY THE BEST MANUFACTER, PIONEER DOES NOT LIST A CONTRAST RATIO.. BUT IF THEY DID LIST ONE THERE DYNAMIC WOULD PROLLI BE 35000:1 DYNAMIC AND 10000:1 NATIVE  OR PROLI DIFFERENT       BASICALLY WHAT IM TRYING TO GET THROUGH UNEDUCATED NONE TECHNICAL MINDS IS THAT ONE THE PLASMA IS THE BETTER TECHNOLOGY AND THAT YOU CANT GO BY CONTRAST NOR CAN YOU WASTE MONEY ON 120 HZ    NOW DO ME A FAVOR... GO TO YOUR LOCAL BEST BUY AND TAKE A LOOK AT A SAMSUNG AND A PIONEER AND TELL SOMEONE TO TURN THEM BOTH OFF DONT LOOK AT THE CARDS....now listen to me the samsung has a million to 1 contrast the pioneer does not list it at all... get like a live broadcast on them so yu can see some flesh tones or something outside  now turn both those televisions on.. you may look at the samsung and say hey nice picture and the pioneer nice but 2 dark..... but now look at everything in the image look at the sky... if you walked outside your sky will never be as bright as it is in an LCD its gonna be more of a natural tone like in the plasma.     High definition mean close to true life which the lcds are not|`|kLK2peV1aa	contrast ratio!!!!!!
d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	My buddy has the 42" Philips and I'm not impressed.  It looks nowhere near as good as my Samsung. Nor was I impressed with them when looking at them in Costco.    The Vizios I've seen seemed to display a good picture, but truthfully, I never seriously looked at them.    Derek above mentioned the Panasonic 42" plasma.  I think that is a much better choice.

Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours siftingthrough thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)    2) Preview before you play  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well.     3) Virus Risks  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for.     4) Settings  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:  - Install  - Select the folder  - Select the quality  - Download your songs    5) Wider Variety of Music  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can.       Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:    Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:    Pros:  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.    2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading    3) No viruses.    4) Preview before you play    Cons:  n/a      Limewire:  Pros:  - You can download free music    Cons:  - Everything else    Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com

I suggest you rent a couple of blue ray movies from netflix so you can find out if you like the quality that the blue ray is suppose to offer you.   I also suggest spending $20.00 on a PS3 remote.

So1T9DKPaa	No doubt it that it would.  Too low volts.  A car audio system takes 12V in order to operate properly without problems.|`|JuHpVfUBaa	Can you still buy 6v auto batteries these days???    The practical answer is NO.  Car audio systems are almost universally designed to operate from a 12v supply but you could in theory run it via a 6v to 12v inverter if you can find one. (Don't hold your breath though)    A high power car audio system already pulls large currents from a 12v supply. If you were to power it from 6v via an inverter the current required would be more than double, you would need massive power leads to avoid voltage drop, plus inverter losses would also have to be factored in.    hope this helps,    Sound Man

pZGLhV2Waa	There is nothing you can do to speed up the recycle time of the flash. It will slow down when your batteries are low though.  Your best bet would be to buy an external flash. For your purposes the Canon 430EXII should be fine. I don't think you would need the top of the line 580EXII though it would recycle even quicker. Not only will either flash recycle faster but they will give you the ability to bounce the flash off the ceiling. This will reduce red eye and will provide a softer more pleasing light. I would also recommend you buy a simple diffuser. This is a little piece of white plastic that slides over the end of the flash. It will further soften the light and help to eliminate harsh shadows.     Look at the links below for a suggestion.    http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/57...    http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/48...    http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/50...    http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/50...|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	An external flash would be your best solution... the internal flash has a 3 sec. recycle time. Verified on this page from Canon.  http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...    I would recommend the 580ex II flash, here is a review|`|qIR9DB9Haa	Yes you can get a 430EX II, which will be a lot better, but do not expect miracles, if its really dark inside and the flash has to use a lot of juice it is still going to take a bit to recycle and the time will increase with the more consecutive shots you take. There are very few strobes that recycle that quickly and they are very expensive. You can always just pick and choose your shots, but a 430EX wont overheat as quickly as the on camera flash so that will be a plus, and you will also be able to use bounce flash techniques.

1c56d6640f8046a9cd43f450d0c344a0aa	Yes you will need a box as your TV is only "HD ready" and therefore has no ATSC tuner in it. It is capable of displaying HD signals as you mentioned so if you invest in a HD OTA tuner box you will get a HD picture to your TV.|`|qGfAlDd2aa	That is an "HD Ready" set meaning it does not contain a digital tuner.  It can not tune digital signals directly, but it can display them.  So, you will need some sort of external HD tuner.      * If you subscribe to cable, you can use the cable company's HD box.      * If you subscribe to satellite, you can use the satellite company's HD receiver.      * If you want to use an antenna, you will need an external ATSC tuner.  There are a number of them available, I've heard good things about the Samsung ones.  This option will give you HD from an antenna.    You could indeed use one of the low cost converter boxes, however that would down convert everything to analog and you would get no benefit from the nice HD display on your set.  You would be happier with one of the first three options.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	you don't need one you tv is hd|`|s7Muujxzaa	Your set is HD ready.    You do not say how you have it connected now, but I see no reason to change anything. Since your set does not have a tuner, you have to have it connected to a cable box of some sort and you can continue doing that with no change.    If you decide you want to receiver over the air broadcasts with some sort of antenna, then you will have to buy an HD tuner, which is different than a converter box (which translates the digital signal back to analog).    Most responders missed this but please make sure you DO NOT buy a converter box... you need an HD or digital tuner if you have decided you want to get over the air HD broadcasts.|`|VbAm6N59aa	If you are using satellite or cable service you are fine. If your TV has a digital tuner you are fine.    One converter box is needed for each TV set without a digital tuner that relies on an antenna  or rabbit ears to receive a TV signal.    http://thinktv.org/onair/onai_dig_faqs.h...

You won't be able to access those files in any way on your iPod once the file is on there, however.    If there's another form of data input you're asking about, please clarify.

nod3Ne9yaa	It really depends on what you are going to use it for.     The Wii is good for party games and family fun, but I never use mine:P The whole motion capture thing is ok, but a bit annoying after a while if you ask me. Sometimes I want to just sit down and kill some monsters without haveing to jump around looking like an idiot to do it ^_^    The Playstation is not just a game console, but also a blue ray player, an entertainment-center and a link between your computer and your TV. It wins at everything, and has a lot of good family games (Buzz, Singstar, Guitar Hero etc).    I love PS3 |`|xQjToANXaa	As per my opinion wii is best.|`|wBE7MQojaa	I would say Wii over Ps3. family should play wii, over ps3.|`|676XZjUYaa	The Playstation 3 and the Nintendo Wii consoles are so different to each that it's hard to say which one is better. Both consoles have things are great, and both have areas of weakness.    The Wii is aimed mainly at people who don't have a lot of gaming experience or who are looking for more casual games. The Wii's most famous feature is the Wii mote controller which responds to movements. So if you swing the controller around, these movements are replicated by your characters on the screen during games. Because of this feature, most of the Wii's games are really interactive and get you involved in the games.    The Wii is great for playing together with friends because the games are so interactive. Some of it's shortcomings though are that it doesn't have a proper hard drive so you can't download a lot of content from the web and it's overall online features aren't as good as the PS3 (except for the Wii Shop).    The Playstation 3 is both a games console and an entertainment system. It can play games, CDs, MP3s, regular DVDs and Blu Ray High Definition DVDs.    The PS3 has amazing graphics and its games are aimed more at hardcore gamers (compared to the Wii which aimed at more casual gamers). A lot of the games follow story lines, and are a little bit like movies. Because of all the features on the Playstation 3, it is quite a but more expensive than the Wii, and the games are generally more expensive too when they're released.    If you're looking for a fun, interactive gaming experience to share with friends, then the Wii is worth a closer look.    If you're looking for a more hardcore gaming and entertainment console, then it's worth looking at the Playstation 3 more closely.    There's a good article comparing all the features of the Wii to the Playstation 3 in the Source section below to help you choose.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	Both are good, but I prefer the Wii|`|oIcdt0FXaa	playstation 3 i have a wii and i dont play it much and i borrowed my mates ps3 when he went on holiday for 2 weeks and my wii got all dusty (i didn't play it once) get a ps3 there so good.    i spent 25 on a hdmi cable just for 2 weeks that how good it is.|`|8KWxpsPQaa	they are both good as each other   ps3 mainly for adults and older children over 7  and wii is for the family its good fun    ps3 has got best graphics than wii   but it depends what you buying it for   for fun for family  (wii)  or just your self   (ps3)|`|8twsa18Iaa	ps3 - hd graphics, way better games, free online play, built in blu-ray dvd player etc etc|`|yEyq2g1iaa	It's hard to say. In my opinion, both systems don't have that many great games. The graphics are way better on the PS3 of course. The Wii is generated to a more family oriented audience, while the PS3 is for the more hardcore gamer. The Wiimote is ok, it's not exactly life changing in my opinion. PS3 has Blu-Ray which is always good, but if you don't have an HDTV it's pointless. So I guess all in all the PS3 is just a little bit better then the Wii. I'm gonna be hated on for this answer lol.|`|1UiYpUWiaa	their both like the yen and yang of consoles(including their color)  the wii is weak in terms of graphic but it uses alot of potential and has a huge title selection that ranges to all ages(most of the adult titles are only coming now like house of the dead overkill,madworld,the conduit)    Nintendo was here way before the PlayStation and their games are the most remembered ones, back when things were simple and it was the gameplay that made the titles and the graphic just want along.  that same thought line was carved into the wii ,as gaming evolved  into the graphic heavy more realism more pixels world that it is now  nintendo decided to walk in its own way,a continued path that has  made them what they are and their best titles show that same way of  thinking has managed to evolve in a different way then their competition took, for the good and the  bad they are what they are  and that's what they do best.    now the ps3 is strong in graphic but its potential has not been used to the fullest in most games(not including the big guns like mgs4 prince of Persia and many  others of course), the PlayStation way is the way of power "better graphics more visuals and the more serious titles and games, when you hook up a ps3 to a hdtv you get more then what you paid for(which is still alot though), the ps3 had support for hdmi 1.3 before televisions were capable of that standard!  true that the pc is now strong enough to fight back the ps3 but it will cost alot more money to get a pc that can beat a ps3(sony was losing money on each one they sold and it cost them alot!)    to answer your question which is best  they are both great for playing the games they were meant to run!  and they both need to improve their online and get more good titles.

J3kfQtViaa	I understand your pain.  The thing is you need to enable upnp on that hub. You need to log into it and find the enable option somewhere in there.  I don't know where it is because i have a linksys.  Mine was in the administration section.  You can send the bt tech support an email though and ask them how to enable upnp.      I also tried opening ports and dmz server, media server connection, everything suggested on the internet, but was never able to get a lower nat type until i searched my router settings and found upnp.      Btw your windows firewall wont interfere with the ps3, but the firewall on the hub is the one that will.

76219e170c33cad6af542e8b69bab5c5aa	as long as your sister is only physically handicapped, I love "TV Show King" (trivia game show type game) and "Brain Challenge" (helps maintain/improve cognition etc) that I bought off of the wii shop channel with Wii Points (you'll need to be able to connect to the internet for this).  These download straight to your console, so there will be no discs to change if she wants to switch between the two (which may be an added bonus)    The only movement required for both is basically point and click.  There is at least one part of brain challenge that requires you to roll/spin the remote to make a tiger move while you answer the questions, but this is only in the "Stress test" so if that would be too hard for her, she can just avoid that section.    Each costs 1000 points, you can get a points card at an electronics store, or you can purchase points over your console w/ a credit card via your internet connection.  The points are 100 points for $1 (so you can get both games for $20)    These are the only ones I can speak from experience that don't require vigorous movement.    Mario Party 8 may be good too b/c all the movement is pretty minimal, but some of the mini games require some vigorous movement (like something comparable to shaking a soda can to explode when opened) and I'm not sure how well your sister could move that fast based on your description.|`|xkqJ6KMvaa	Zelda, great game and requires no real movement of the arms|`|ETeWLHEGaa	poor girl, I'm sorry to say but, your sister can't play active games like that until she's all healed and to answer your question it depends on how crippled the person is
AA11288692	I have PS2 Guitar Hero (GH), and I have the Wii Rock Band (RB).   I will say GH is harder to play, and has more songs. Also, when your going throught the phases, you complete 6 out of 8 to reach the next set. In RB you must complete all the songs listed to reach the next set.  I prefer RB over GH because of the option to play the drums if I want, or have friends over and we can all play at the same time.|`|F7GIhRWMaa	GH world tour I got rock band but its way too easy GH I think it the best.|`|EoawVhBTaa	Before I go into this I'll say i have an xbox 360. That being said, I prefer rock band.. I like the songs better and it's a lot easier for me to sing in rock band than it is in gh world tour. (I'm someone that loves to sing in these games). But as far as the drum kit goes, world tour is much better. Also for someone that sings, world tour kinda sucks cuz you can't do the vocal battles against people on live. I still don't consider either to have true rock without atleast some Tom Petty but that's just me.|`|VcNHahtgaa	Rock Band is so much better in almost every way.    But are you going to get Rock Band 2 also?    Since your planning on Rock Band 1 for $99, you can also get Rock Band 2 the disc only for another $49. That means you can play 140 songs for only $149. With Guitar Hero World Tour, you can only play 85 songs.    Also in Rock Band 2, you can have a "no fail mode", meaning you can play hard songs without failing. Also in both versions, you can save a friend if they fail but in Guitar Hero, if someone fails you all fail.    And Rock Band 2 also is very organized with their song list, Guitar Hero's is all clustered.|`|HekFanRvaa	guitar hero has more songs and they have more follow up sets of songs coming up..|`|JW83GMkLaa	are you talking about guitar hero world tour?    well anyways, ive only played rock band a couple of times, i dont really know if there is any difference, but i find it easier to play on rock band and harder on guitar hero. The songs-it all depends on what songs you like.  So, for me i think Guitar Hero is a better choice.|`|lebKMTaQaa	First I'd like to say that I agree with just about everyone here.    I like the drums in GH:WT better but I like the format (touring and setting set lists, rather than the rigid  "play this block of songs...ok now this block..." of GH) of RB2 better.  RB2 is more forgiving but GH has better characters and customization (along with celebrity guests that you can play as).  As far as the songs, it is very close and completely a matter of opinion. GH has Tool, which is why I bought that first, but RB2 has some awesome classics that you can't beat (Bad Company, Bob Dylan, AC/DC, etc).    Bottom line, they are both awesome games that do things a little bit different, and both have some positives and negatives. Get both and jam!|`|AA11144013	ok i love and i mean love rock band it is the best out of the two why you might ask because you can make your own band and characters and change everything about them from clothes to hair to make up i mean its so much fun and if u have friends over alot like me its a number one buy the songs are great and if your one who goes and buys extra songs then rock bands for you since they'll have 500+ songs for download|`|nPFgW5XRaa	Personally I prefer World Tour for the improved drum kit. It has an extra 'pad' and has a layout which feels more like a set of drums than the Rock Band kit with the raised cymbal pads.    The song quality is very good on both, so you won't notice a difference there.|`|bZv3KkvNaa	you made a great choice guitar hero is the best it is harder and has better songs, better close for the characters and you can make characters and songs
DkG8W69faa	Hi, these are two names for one and the same device. When the BlackBerry 9500 was announced by RIM, they called it the thunder but before its release someone must have thought storm sounds better and there it was. you can also see that from the model number they gave it. The storm is called 9500 from vodafone and 9530 from verizon, exactly the same numbers the thunder had when it was announced.   BTW it's an awesome device. personally like it a lot better than iPhone 3G.

ZvrWsdbEaa	The dollar per day option is only if you use the phone for that day, if you don't use the phone that day you aren't charged.  You would have to pay a higher cost for the phone.  Call a retail store in your area and ask if they have the phone in a prepaid kit, it's normally sold for cheaper that way rather than just buying the phone at full retail price, which for the 2008 version is $300.

b7ec286ba36c5c040ddf9f2ef86e6c3eaa	Your dad is the only authorized person that can make changes, or authorize upgrades unless he personally calls and puts you on as the co-owner (which any responsible parent would be crazy to do).    If you are buying an iphone from a respectable dealer/retailer, then you will have to renew your 2 year contract-Best Buy, Walmart, and Apple do not sell them straight out of the case where you just insert your sim card.     You wouldn't have to know what kind of family plan you have, but the iphone is sold with the mandatory data plan, so a change to the family plan would be in order and your dad would have to authorize that unless he lost his mind and authorized you on the account to make changes and upgrades.    I suggest you talk to your dad and see about the upgrade.  If you have several hundred dollars to pay full out (an 8gb retails for about $550) then pay for your upgrade and the difference of changing the plan.    No offense intended with the remarks about putting kids on to authorize changes.  I work in a cell phone retailer and see the headaches it creates for parents when they let their kids talk them into it.

lebKMTaQaa	Newer plasma TVs do not have that big of a problem with burn in. Some (like mine) actually have a setting to shift the image a few pixels every so often to avoid this sort of thing (you can't tell it is doing it at all). Older plasmas and rear projection TVs were really prone to this sort of thing, but manufactures have addressed this problem. The caution on burn in usually occurs if you leave the TV on a static (frozen, not fuzzy) screen for hours on end, like a 8 hours or longer. I wouldn't suggest testing that, but it should be OK. I have played on mine for 6 to 8 hours straight and never had a problem. If you are really worried about it, shut it off every couple hours or just switch games every so often. The danger is with icons that stay on the screen and never change, like a health bar or something. But with games now, play is usually broken up by a cut scene or you call up a menu, so no part of the screen stays static for too long.    Remember, burn in only occurs when a still image is in the same spot over a long period of time. And it is not just games. The TV does not know the difference between a game image and a movie image. The same thing can happen with a paused movie. The reason they caution specifically about games is due to games having static images like health bars and such.|`|Kx1J5zo5aa	No, it wont break it as long as you plug in the cord to the correct holes and stuff and make sure the PS3 doesn't overheat. You should be fine.|`|AA10021093	thats what its for dude|`|jXYXMsXHaa	Your PS3 won't be harmed while playing on either, however, I would recommend playing video games on the LCD only, as plasma televisions are prone to "burn in".  If you are unfamiliar with "burn in" take a look at the images you see on old arcade machines, old monitors, or on teller machines, this is what happens when you have "static"(stationary images like icons or logos) images always on your screen.  LCD televisions also have a longer lifespan.|`|ZPTLTWbdaa	It should be ok, but it can burn the screen.  If you paused the game for, say half an hour the paused image would burn on to the plasma screen to a more severe degree than when it does that on LCD then fades-just be aware of that.|`|cyJ3i6ilaa	play on the plasma!!! plasma is alot better at displaying black levels! the picture will look alot better!  you dont have to worry about burn in on the plasma modern day plasmas have built in technology to prevent this. i have played on my 42 inch plasma for more thaan 6 hours ata atime and have even forgot it on for the weekend i whent on vacation! it wont cause any damage.|`|HekFanRvaa	plasma is not a good screen to play games for 6 hours.. you will have a screen burn-in problem... just use the LCD.

Jailbreak cons---- your warranty of 1 year of apple store will be lost, plus you will not be ever supported by apple if you jailbreak.  2. if you messs up, then your ipod touch is worthless and won't work unless you restore (some times that doesn't work)    what i would do is wait another year until the warranty expires or wait for the REAL ipod jailbreak (check quickpwn) the dev team should be finished by , say 1 month or so.|`|MiVspyt9aa	i don't know sorry|`|9OmhI62vaa	Hey, im sorry buts thats fake, but the Jailbreak is coming out from Dev Team.

jTFdG8xqaa	not sure about the error exactly. What i would do is this. When you hook up to your computer and turn on itunes then you are able to reinstall the factory settings that came on your ipod. Do so. Then unplug if the problem is gone sweet nice and easy otherwise bring your ipod to an apple store and explain the problem. They work with the things all the time if they haven't heard of the problem i would give apple a call and see what they say, you paid for the product now it doesn't work, and as long as you haven't say dropped it in a lake it should still work. Good luck!

There are a lot of great games available, and others on the way (as you mentioned).     I have both a PS3 and a Wii. I play the PS3 way more, for sure, but I still rock on the Wii every now and then.

42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	No offence...but there are likely tens of thousands of games that are legally downloadable onto a PC. It might help if you told us which game you're referring to...a shooter game has different controls than, say a dating sim. Some are pure point and click, some are pure keyboard, some are a combination.    If you post additional info with the game's name, perhaps someone can help you?    Good Luck!    EDIT: Ok...weird...the install instructions are in the game book that came with the disk. Y'know, the one with the 20 to 25 digit number stamped on the back of it?    Presumably you installed it correctly (as opposed to actually downloading it). I am also presuming that the game is a legally obtained copy, so I would suggest you contact Rockstar Games (link below) and post something in the forums there, or go to the FAQ pages to see if there was someone else that had the same issues.

'Tomb Raider Underworld' is also a top Action/Adventure game and even it's prequel 'TR: Anniversary' got above average reviews.    No More Heroes and Disaster: Day of Crisis are certainly worth a look.  Even 'Prince Of Persia: Rival Swords' is a worthy mention.  'Secret Files: Tunguska' is another hidden gem, as is 'Zack & Wiki: Quest For Barbaros' Treasure' although they are slightly more point and click adventures.    The upcoming 'Deadly Creatures' looks good as does 'Fatal Frame IV: The Mask Of The Lunar Eclipse.'

jTFdG8xqaa	It's possible. It sounds like an odd problem to say the least...though it may have a problem with memory managment at the higher end, but the company considered it good enough to market. He may have been suggesting that getting your memory close to full when expanded will cause problems (just like it does with a computer). I would say that it is probably ok for you to put in an 8 GB card but if you start to expierience problems then you know he was right. good luck!

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	You don't want any of those.  Why would you buy a DVD player when you already have one of the best DVD/Blu-ray players made?  I see prices ranging from $150 to $300 or so.  What amount of that cost is taken by a DVD player you won't even be using?  Sure they're cheap, but if you bought any of those you would be wasting money.  You don't want a player-based home theater in a box (HTIB).  What you want is one that is receiver-based.    In my opinion the best receiver-based HTIBs are made by Onkyo.    http://www.us.onkyo.com/prod_class.cfm?c...    Because your TV (presumably) and PS3 are HD, you might want to buy an HTIB that is able to play the uncompressed audio soundtracks that are available on Blu-ray discs.  If that's the case get the HT-S6100.  If its $600 price tag is more than you want to spend, go with the HT-S4100.  It's a decent 5.1 system, much better than those you link to.  You can get a factory recertified HT-S4100 on eCost right now for $169.99.  Considering the MSRP is $499.99 that's a pretty good deal.    http://www.ecost.com/Detail/HTIB/Onkyo/H...

pl6eDKQbaa	Its a bunch of iPod accessories that you can buy, mainly audio systems like hi fi and clock radios, etc. So that means costly. Which means you don't really want to buy a new one  =P|`|UOz1LPIHaa	iHome is technically just a brand name of iPod accessories.      Generally, they're some sort of speaker dock with various options by model. . . although I'm sure they probably make some other gizmos I don't know about.

LH4Zr6MZaa	The iPod Nano 4th generation is really great! I think it's around $200.  It is super thin and also plays videos. I just bought a 3rd generation iPod (because I prefer the shape of the older model) and it's really nice.  My other iPod, purchased 5 years ago, still works great but I had to replace the battery after 2 years which cost only $20 and I could do by myself in 20 minutes. The new iPod Nanos, I think, cannot change the battery but I don't think you'll need to worry because the newest batteries are much more reliable than those 5 years ago.     If you only want songs, maybe an iPod Shuffle will do although they don't hold many songs and there's no screen to see what song you're listening to.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	1st generation is never quite as good as the ones after it.  The next generations come out after they fix everything reported wrong with the 1st gen.  To hold 1000 songs you need at least 4gb which rules out the ipod shuffle.  If you tend to drop things a lot you might want to look at the nano.  It has flash memory instead of a hard drive so it's more durable.  If that's not a problem for you and you prefer something larger (easier to hold?) then the classic or touch are good too.  The ipod touch has wifi which the others do not have.  If you want to buy new then it's the same price anywhere you go.  Apple products do not go on sale.  If you order from apple you can get it engraved but that's the only difference.    If you want to buy used try craigslist.com.  Go to the link for your state and the closest city to you and check under electronics.|`|uIg6an6Jaa	try the new ipod nano     the little 4 gigs hold mor than that an can play vids too     and all for about 149$ i think   and you can get them at walmart or best buy ... or just about an were

7XIyslo5aa	Don't sync your iPod. When you plug it in, and the page comes up with the headings:    iPod  Version  Options    In options check 'Manually manage music and videos'      Should sort it.|`|AA12180617	You are using it the wrong way  when you sync your ipod it syncs with what is on the computer.      Keep all your music on the computer.    The ipod is designed to work with and be the slave to itunes on the computer to which its paired.    If you do not pair a ipod to a computer you cannot alter its settings.    If you pair your ipod to a new computer it overwrites what's on it.    Simply dragging music onto an ipod does NOT make that music playable it then acts as hard disk. To make the music playable you MUST use itunes to sync with it as only itunes can put the music files in the correct file names (not the same as on the computer) in hidden folders and create the hidden indexes for them to be playable.    When you pair the ipod to a computer it erases ALL the previous library and tracks and replaces it with what the current computer want it to.    if you want to erase the ipod you select RESTORE form the ipod's tab in itunes then it re formats and re installs the ipods firmware resetting everything to default values and removing the lock (except for the touch which asks for the code to allow this)    the ipod needing a master player to sync with is NOT unique to apple Creative, Zune, Sony al have one of one sort or another.      When you add songs to itunes you don't add the actual song - just a link to it's location. ?The "!" means that that song is no longer findable . For example the memory stick has been removed. ?To avoid this you need to do the following:-    In iTunes preferences set both ?"let iTunes manage my music" And "iTunes keeps local copy in music folder " - the exact wording and location in preys will depend on version of iTunes you are running    Once you have done this, plug in your memory stick again and add the tracks again to  The library (this time the screen in itunes will say copying songs briefly).    Then to let iTunes manage your music select "consolidate library " from  Either the file or advanced menus again this depends on  The version of iTunes you are running .    Your music is now stored as links in the library plus the actual files are in  Your iTunes music folder and to be safe you should back up the contents of your iTunes folder on my music
wCDIVS4Haa	Try resetting all your key bindings to "default." Then restart the game. Make sure you hold down the R key long enough so that it will holster the weapon. There is at least one patch out for Fallout 3 so make sure you have that installed as well. Good Luck.

Fallout 3 for example, same achievements as trophies.|`|3AChQgbZaa	um the trophy system is not just a rip off it operates differently.  you earn trophies for doing certain things there are four levels. bronze silver gold and platinum for collecting all the others for the game.  not every game has them at this point.  but from now on all games on the ps3 are required to have trophies,  there is a decent amount of trophy supporting games.  it is set up on leveling system.  trophies are less of a rip off than avatars are of miis|`|pl2SocVKaa	not every game and its like the same thing as acheivements|`|5TbtXdJXaa	it is almost the same as xbox achievements.  but not every game has trophies.
TGeTsqVoaa	I answered this question in the lgcommunity forum so you can follow the link below for even more info, otherwise, here is a condensed answer.:  I transferred an 80GB movie to my microSD card and inserted it into my Dare. I played it back off the card and it was rather slow. The audio didnt match up with the video. Then I moved it to the phones memory and it played back just fine.    I use Magic DVD Ripper www.magicdvdripper.com to convert (thus compress) video files.  You can download a free trial version. I liked it so much I bought it $34.97. Magic DVD Ripper will pull files from a DVD or from any source on your hard drive. You can convert them to MPeg4 or MP4s to play on your Dare.    Hope that helps.|`|b7ec286ba36c5c040ddf9f2ef86e6c3eaa	Didn't it come with an owners manual or user guide?  Every phone I've gotten came with one.

5fOukPUraa	Yes, this is possible. I have done this before too. I am assuming you have made another XBL Account. You can have Silver/Gold. It doesn't matter. You just need to be able to get online. Go to your Friends list. Then go to Add Friend(s). Type in your Gamer Tag, the one that got deleted. Then he will show up on your list as "Pending" hit A on the name. Then go to the right tab and go to Friends. Then you can add your friends, if it shows and you don't have it on friends-view-only. I hoped I helped, if not I can take you step-by-step on XBL.

c1sRWiX3aa	I wouldn't say 'no' to answer your question, but I think 'doubtful' is a good answer.    First, they recently dropped the price by $100. Add to that the fact that they are dominating the PS3 in sales (their biggest competition) and I think another price drop depends on:    Is the rumored $50 price drop for the PS3 in March true? And if it is, how will that price drop effect sales of the 360....if any?    Honestly, I just don't see Microsoft doing another price drop when there is no reason to right now. Sales are still brisk, and as I mentioned earlier they are still beating their biggest competitor (Sony) by a fairly large margin.    However, if the $50 price drop on the PS3 makes a huge splash (my guess is it won't, they need to drop their price by at least $100 in my opinion to make any real progress) then I could see Microsoft dropping their price again to be in line with Sony's drop.     Long answer, I know, but I think a lot factors into your question.|`|VPnCk2Muaa	I think there's about a 35% chance that it will.|`|eD2SzJ2Jaa	there is a good chance the price will be decreased, probably not significantly though :/|`|STUsNoNTaa	If you look back through console history you will find that consoles always drop when new ones are about to come out  or demand drops, Have you heard of any new generation consoles coming out any time soon? no and demand is not dropping but the only thing that will push down prices is the credit crunch but prices might only drop by about 25 on average you will find more packages available trying to shift  not so popular games with one must buy game to help console sell|`|7qhKpYCJaa	well i think maybe they will but still 130 for a HD games console is pretty damn good.  what i recccomend to you is to buy the premium as it comes with 60 GB hard drive  wich is good value for money as it isn't as small as 20GB (really!) but dosen't cost too much like the 120 GB    if you aren't willling to splash out on it get the 20 GB  there isn't definetly going to be a MK9 but that isn't the reason to get the console out there with the better community same graphics and less americans than a ps3    Full Hd is Full HD, it dosen't matter what console it is played on.  ( Ha Ha the Ps3 has just lost it's trump card)  It also depends on the effort put in to developing a game.    sorry about rambling on but quite some valid points i think . Bye.|`|sg1wfaTAaa	the 360 will drop in price before the end of the year because another iteration will be out to replace it. xbox has promised to come out with a new hardware design at least once a year until they get it right (that's why there's so many versions of xbox out right now). apparently the newer versions of the xbox are still prone to the RROD (in fact they expected 1 million units to fail in 2008 per the attached article).     so expect more versions to roll out until they can resolve the RROD problem. which means the version that it replaces will go down in price just as they've been doing for years now.    i gave up on xbox after 3 failed units and i haven't looked back. there were some great games on xbox but you can't play them if the system keeps crapping out. do yourself a favor and get a wii or ps3 or even an nes. i have those all hooked up and none of them have crapped out and there are enough variety of games there that will make you forget and regret spending so much time on a craptastical system like the xbox|`|ejfhLgG6aa	lol well im 113 pounds! lol! silly british kid!|`|oJJmJTuaaa	no|`|FPJSoxYwaa	I don't know if the prices can get any lower than they already are, if they do, i don't think it will drop by much.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Probably not.|`|hnXS1Nttaa	Well, here in Australia, the price of the PlayStation3 has only 'officially' dropped once from $999 to $699. You can buy the 80GB model here now for $598 minimum, because they just weren't moving of our retailer's shelves. Now that the PlayStation3 is about to enter into its third year of sales, I would say a price drop is immenent for their console - that is if Sony wants to reclaim the console war victory. Therefore, Microsoft will follow suit with the Xbox 360, I wouldn't expect the 360 Arcade to drop in price too much more - the 360 dropped twice in price last year alone, but the Elite will definitely drop in price because a PlayStation3 with a bigger hard drive is in development.|`|eG7pYnGxaa	Yes because they are going to be out of date pretty soon

K01NU24saa	LG is making good quality products . LG home air-con is world No 1 ( total Quantity sold , for the pass 7 year worldwide.) LG is the new name from Lucky Gold Star after 1995. is second Korea giant Electronic firm after Samsung.

They are the ones most often used in tests against Plasmas.  They have great picture quality.    After that I'd look at Sony and Sharp Aquos.  Sony stopped making LCD panels, they just buy them from Sharp now (they use the Sharp Aquos ones).  Sony's chips might offer a bit better picture quality, but not likely in the bang-for-buck category.  But a Sony on sale is a solid choice.  I would also lump a Panasonic Viera LCD in around here.  I think they are solid sets, but if I'm going Panasonic Viera, I'm going Plasma (I think they only make LCDs in smaller sizes anyway).    I would put like LG and Hitachi in the next batch.  I think there are some really solid LG performers out there.  And they review well in the bang-for-buck category.  But I think they don't quite standout as top performers in picture quality.  But take that with a grain of salt, as the people doing the reviews are like eagle eyes for that kind of stuff.

8cDd70dSaa	Sorry, no. You can either get your music free of charge or free of virus (and legal ramifications). If you get it for free, it will be considered illegal and may mess up your computer. You don't have to purchase iTunes to use it, but any music you get from iTunes needs to be paid for. It's typically about $0.99 per song.|`|7XIyslo5aa	You can download iTunes for free.

AbRfd29Haa	A couple possibilities:    1) Len cap... is it on? Ok, that's kind of a silly question, only not really. Some camcorders have automatic lens covers of various designs. When you're in camcoder mode, is the lens uncovered?     2) Could be the sensor.. if the video sensor is dead, you don't get video. Period.     3) Is there a setting for external video input... not usual, but some cameras have an external video input mode that overrides others. That's usually active in "VCR" mode, not "Camcorder" mode, but it's worth checking into.     You bought it used.. the original sellers may well have video. It could even be from this camcorder, but things change. Maybe it went bad and they decided to sell it... did you check it out when you bought it, have then show you the camera in operation? Was the price crazy-cheap? Things to ask about.

A word of caution if you leave an image on a plasma too long it can burn in an image on the screen.  Many video games have a banner/score area that stays on sreen for much of the game.

w4I9oj2Maa	Well, you may not have a PICTURE TUBE TV SET....    That applied to the older CRT picture tube tv sets that were adjustable...    Newer TVs like the Plasma or the LCD have different fixes to them, even though the symptoms are the same...    So it's very important to know if the 32AFX61 is a CRT TV , LCD TV or Plasma TV..    . Hmm, 32AFX doesn't show up...32HFX61 does.  Information points to an LCD TV set.    FIRST, let's RESET your TV by unplugging the power cord for 5 minutes to reset the TV's computer,  and also do the SAME if you have a satellite or Cable box....    Now we have everything set to correctly provide a good picture.    Still see those green lines?

qGfAlDd2aa	The current law reads ..."no later than 11:59 pm"... on February 17.  So we don't get the last minute.    It may get moved to June 12, but that hasn't happened yet.  The Senate may vote on it again next week, but it still has to pass the Senate and have the Pres sign it.    Even if the deadline does change, the law reads "no later than" so there is nothing stopping individual stations from still transitioning before the deadline.  Wilmington, NC and Hawaii have already done it.|`|yC4REA3waa	it is feb 17th|`|5prmKXELaa	=)|`|87DaOGDIaa	i thought it got moved 2 june.|`|Vqe6cvRGaa	They moved it to June or July, no joke, Obama passed the delay because he felt that many Americans were not ready for the transition, economically I am assuming...|`|aUTLstpAaa	go to cnn.com and type in DTV conversion.

However, it comes with only one controller.     You can choose to buy a separate controller - or you can buy Wii Play, which has a bunch of basic games and a controller (for about $10 more than the cost of a controller). For someone who has never used a wii, the games in Wii Play are great in learning how to use the controller.     You might also want to buy "num chuk" controllers, which connect to the main controllers (wii remotes). The num chuk is necessary for boxing in wii sport and for the tank game in Wii Play.     One other suggestion is to get rechargeable batteries. They're more expensive up front, but will save you money in replacing all those batteries down the road. Energizer has batteries and a recharger that can recharge in 15 - 30 minutes. Alternatively, there are some rechargeable batteries specifically meant for the wii, that charge while the wii more is docked in the charging stand.

HJnk5zjyaa	You want the best that you can buy? Well that depends on how much you have to spend.  This first list consists of guitars that cost from $6000-$20,000. These guitars are handmade by one person.  1. Olson Guitars www.olsonguitars.com (James Taylor uses these)  2. Ryan Guitars www.ryanguitars.com  3. Applegate Guitars www.applegateguitars.com  4. Cornerstone Guitars  5. Charles A. Fox Guitars  6. Walker Guitars  7. There is so many more I can't list all of them.     This second list consists of mass produced guitars in factories but with high quality.  Prices range from $700-$10,000 depending on which model you choose from each company.  Usually about $2500 will get you a excellent guitar.  1. Taylor (my personal favorite, check out the 714ce or 814ce)  2. Martin Guitars (has the legendary D28 model, almost every great musician in the 60's and 70's had one)  3. Santa Cruz Guitars (very popular with todays musicians)  4. Collings Guitars  5. Bourgeois Guitars (tap tuned guitars, very nice)  6. Larrivee Guitars (great guitars for the price)    Good luck finding the guitar, remember its not the price that makes a guitar great but the playability and sound. I would take a easy playing and great sounding cheap guitar over a expensive mediocre one any day.|`|0F8hauikaa	Martin or Gibson would be my choice for an acoustic. I have two acoustics, Takamine and Yamaha, which are very good, but someone else bought them for me.  I've always wanted a Gibson and a lot of my friends swear by Martin guitars. I would recommend that you play several and look for these three things, you like the sound, it stays in tune after a few songs and has easy action (meaning you shouldn't have to press the strings real hard).|`|b7ec286ba36c5c040ddf9f2ef86e6c3eaa	Air guitars
7L0p6Hciaa	For me to write down how to play the guitar and for that to be helpful would probably take me about 10,000 words. By the time i'd finished this question would be closed :)    Thankfully for you, these guys have done it for you:  http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/lessons/    :)    Good luck    start with this one maybe: http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/lessons/f...  (bare in mind from a quick look, if you know how to read tab those diagrams are actually upside down - if you don't know tab then perfect...the bottom line is the bottom string, top is top)      Good luck!

yM7YPmzSaa	can you not reset it? Call the company and find out how
mhyyX6fzaa	Unfortunately you can't. You can only save a limited amount to your phone.
yNbGq4viaa	If you know what company did the charge I would contact them and tell them you want to know who charged time with your debit card.  I would also notify your bank immediately.  You will probably need to get a new debit card number to avoid future charges from this person and they can investigate the charges and perhaps even reverse them.  You will have to agree to prosecute the person in most circumstances which I most definitely would.|`|AA10628838	Have your bank to investigate the charge.|`|w4kdTalPaa	Start at you bank they should have tracking numbers to the cell provider. Then you can contact the provider and provide the tracking numbers from your bank and they should be able to cross reference the tracking numbers to the account that was credited.
oVxr5B3Eaa	It's actually quite a pain and expense to get out of your contract with bell. Your going to have to BUY out... aka pay for every month you have left on your plan. Last time I checked, bell's was something like 400 dollars plus 20 dollars for every month remaining. My friend just tried to buy out of hers (with 3 months remaining) at it was going to be a little over 400 dollars. I don't know if it's the same now, but sometimes they will even make you COMPLETELY pay the FULL monthly charge for every month remaining.   First thing to do is contact bell and ask they how much it would be to buy out of your contract. Your likely looking at a minimum of about 400 dollars though. Then you simply have to call rogers and tell them you want to sign up, but you won't be able to keep your number...     Contracts suck.     Sorry!|`|kT7lkAJJaa	I'm saving up my allowance so I can get a Motorola PEBL U6 soon.

Xxviy63Paa	run the composite cable into the capture card on your pc, and play the video on your pc's monitor. That's the only way, if there isn't a tv-out, or a dvi or hdmi-out on your pc, or a vga-in on your TV...    Unless you are willing to spend a few bucks. In which case the cheapest way would be go to radio shack and get a 1-plug to 2-plug signal splitter (1 female to 2 female) and an extra RCA cable. Then you can run the same signal to both your TV and your PC.    If you've got a VCR with more than one video out, and an A/V input, that would work too. Same with a dvd player.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	You'll have to plug the PS3 into your PC with its s-video cable, sold separately.  You'll then be able to see the PS3 screen as a window on your PC, and play that way while the PC is recording.   It won't be HD though.    In a few years, we should start seeing DVRs that can take HD video input, and record that onto a blu-ray disc.  This would give you true HD, which you could then take to your PC for ripping, editing, etc.
UAYzLyN4aa	Look at the fine print on the charger. If it says something like     Input: 100-240V, 50-60 Hz    (and it probably will say that) then your charger already works from wall current in London, Europe, Japan, the whole world. All you need is a plug adapter. Britain uses a three-prong plug with very large prongs.     If it doesn't say that, then you'll need a voltage converter, more correctly called a transformer. There are two types of these. You want the type for low wattage stuff. 50 watt capacity should be enough for charging a digital camera. There are high wattage converters (1600 watts) sold in travel stores but they are good only for things like light bulbs and electric heaters - not "electronics", and in my opinion they are unsafe.     As someone else mentioned, the rest of Europe uses a different plug.  Switzerland and Italy are each different from the rest of Europe (and from each other).  An *ungrounded* US to Europe adapter (has only two prongs) will work in Europe, Switzerland, and Italy sockets, but if you want grounding you need to get the specific adapters for those places.    Edit -added: Yeah, all the plugs on things in the UK have fuses right in the plugs. I have adapters with fuses in them too, but they're much bulkier than the non-fused types. The UK electrical codes do require the fuse, but the outlet doesn't care - my non-fused adapters work just fine.     Also be aware that UK electric outlets each have a switch next to them, in the same wall plate - again, this is required by law. If your charger isn't working try flipping this switch.|`|vjAGUCSlaa	Buy the adaptor and you'll be fine. Can easily be purchased at WalMart or similar stores fro under $20.00. There is also a package available which comes with a variety of adaptors. if you plan to visit other countries in the future may be worth the extra few bucks. I bought the multi pack for under $30.00 last year and used it in Europe and Asia...|`|cf8ab77939ead7223bbb655f627c7404aa	A U.S. to U.K. adapter.  Available at Staples.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	yes, just an adapter and you'll be fine    if you go across to Paris you will need a different adopter- most hotels let you borrow them though|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	If you are sure your charger can use 240V (most li-ion chargers can), all you need is a plug adapter. Be sure you get one with a fuse, as you need one in the plug for UK outlets.
y2nC8BUGaa	you didn't ask a question
23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	You have to select the HDMI input on the tv set. On most sets this will by one of the AV buttons. If you've done this and get no input then look at the laptop.    The video output ports on some laptops have to switched on. Normally you do this by pressing the AltGr and F4 keys simultaneously. This will toggle the laptop's video to the screen and the output ports.  If that doesn't work then you're going to have to look at the computer's set up parameters.

U9vlNqPSaa	Actually it is up to individual.   The - points of having a touchscreen phone is that the screen gets spoiled easily once you dropped it. If you are someone who drops your phone often, you need to seriously consider changing to one which is not.    But other than that, touchscreen is a fun way of handling your phone. The phone may not be that sensitive, but you can get use to it. Go online to read on the reviews of the phones you like and see what users feel about the phones so that you can make a better choice before making your purchase.|`|7SbOCfI1aa	i think all new phones are either going to be sliders or touch screen, i have an lg vu and i love it and ive heard the storm isn't getting very good reviews
