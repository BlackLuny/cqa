My father has cancer and my mother died 3 years ago.I have lived in Thailand for 4 years and missed her funeral.So when I found out he has cancer I made up my mind to bring him back to Thailand with me to live out his days at my house under coconut trees,relaxing on white sand beaches looking at pool blue water.That all sounds good and he is 100% ready to go but it is the going that is going to be the difficult part of getting there.He is weak.Very weak.He is on oxygen and always sleepy.I know some people may say maybe you should just leave him in America but you cannot understand what it feels like to see your father in 1 bed all day doing nothing but watching TV waiting to die.He deserves something more.He took perfect care of us and so we as his children will do the same for him.I would rather he left us sitting on the beach with excellent Thai care,happy with me and my family rather than with strangers in a boring,sad room.My question is(money is not a problem)are there any airlines that cater 100% to the needs of a patient in his position for travel.He cannot walk far and needs good rest.I know how hard flying can be from America to Thailand just for me.So I need full comfort for him.Where can I find the most relaxing non stressful flights for him with wheelchair service?   ALL HELP WILL BE APPRECIATED EVEN FROM YOU PATRICK IN KHON KAEN,THAILAND.

20090222232644AAIiTaM	Travel;Australia;Perth	Are there TV 'dead zones' in Perth?	I've just moved to Kensington, Perth, WA. The house doesn't have an antenna on it, so I bought myself a small portable one for the TV. I don't need fantastic quality, after all.      However, it is only picking up SBS. Not 'snowy' other channels. NOTHING but SBS.      I tested the antenna in Maylands and it worked perfectly, picking up all channels. I've looked online and on broadcasting websites to see if they have a list of 'dead zones' and - if so - possible solutions.      Nothing.      Does anyone know of any 'Dead Zones' in Perth? Kensington is just south of the CBD, just over the river.. it seems crazy that the capital city of the state wouldn't have TV coverage in the middle of the city..

20090223012426AAMnWg7	Travel;United States;Los Angeles	I work as a night clerk at a hotel.  Do you think it looks bad in the middle the night if I have my shoes off?	I work in an office near the front desk; my main job is the books,  but I do have to handle guests who may be checking in or out.  During the winter, sometimes I remove my boots. and my manager tells me she would rather I just go up to the counter in my socks, rather than make a guest wait while I slip my boots on.    We are basically informal and I just wear jeans and a top and only have a name tag; not a uniform.    I work from 10 to 6 am but don't cover the desk until midnight.           So I guess my question is, if you were a hotel guest who was checking in or getting towels or whatever, would you mind if the clerk was in sock-feet?      thanks    Randi
