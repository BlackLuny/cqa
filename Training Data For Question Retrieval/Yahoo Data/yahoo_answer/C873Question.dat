20090219205136AArSuqF	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	House and Car purchase advice?	Hi,   1. Is it true that if you're buying a new car for cash that you get a rebate (cash back).   I'm asking because I'm trying to decide between buying a $3000 used car and saving to buy a new one in one year or buying a new one with $5000 cash back ('08 suzuki xl 7: paying $23000 instead of $28000) and pay it off in 12 months.      2. what is the best way to get a reliable cheap used car of about $2500 to $3000 that will not need repairs for 3 years.      3. Also, can one buy/finance a home with only two years of credit history, 6 months of employment history with salary of $7000/month, a credit score of 750?      Summary: 'Should I rent an apartment and buy a $2500 used car now and get a new home and car in 3 years or should I just go ahead and get the new car now and home because (a) if I rent an apartment, after two to three years, I would have payed over $20000 in rent (that would have gone into paying for the home) (b) if I buy a $2500 car now, after two to three years, the trade in value will be close to zero, I might as well get a new one now and pay it off in 12 month.   I need suggestions.      THANK YOU.

20090219212720AA6N3UN	Business & Finance;Insurance	How are lost wages determined for the self employed in an auto accident?	Someone totaled my van today. I offer a mobile service so my van is my place of business. This guy destroyed my place of business, my means to earn a living. So far everything I have read says that lost wages are for being too injured to work, So far I have not gone to a doctor, I have been doing my best to keep my customers that are calling at bay till I can get some wheels. If I show from receipts, bank statements,and phone logs that I have an extremely thriving business, will I be able to receive lost wages at least by averaging my last few months of income? I was told that if I rented a van I could get reimbursed. If I purchase a new vehicle in the mean time can I be reimbursed for that as well, or at least a good portion of it? Someone mentioned that I would have to show that I had the jobs already lined up and lost them to someone else. My business is an emergency response service so it is virtually impossible to line anything up- they are stuck and I come out immediately. Surely the fact that I have proof that everyday people call me and I make 400 bucks or so almost each day, should be enough to say that I am losing income, right? Also, do I really need an attorney for this?

We both signed our mortgage and title for the 2nd property in August 2008.       Does my partner qualify as a First Time Home buyer even though I am also on the mortgage and title and don't qualify?

I recieved a call today from a company named North West Warranty (I dont remember exactly) but they were claiming that I am eligible for a warranty on my car I bought recently. My only concern is my car has 79,000 miles and they are offering an additional 4 years or 100,000 miles (making it covered until 180,000 miles) for a payment of $2,400 or monthly payments of $145 for however many months it takes to pay it off. My car is a 2002 Audi a6 4.2, its a nice car and a warranty would be great. But I lost my job and money is low but this would help alot of problems.

20090219220458AAIxeLG	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	Just graduated with a marketing degree, but i am thinking about going into nursing - anyone have advice?	Hi, I just graduated in December from a good school with a marketing degree and a psychology minor.  However, I just don't think I will be good in the business world.  I really don't have a business way of thinking - I never have understood the business world, and have pretty much no interest in it. Plus I am sort of socially awkward when it comes to having to be "professional." I am always incredibly nervous during my interviews and am not all that articulate when I speak.  Since the economy is so bad, all of the marketing related jobs I have been looking at are sales - which I feel needs excellent professional communication skills.  But the thing is, when I am in a suit pretending to know what I am talking about in business, I do NOT come off as articulate! I have always had public speaking fears and have been nervous in general in a business environment.  I am WAY more interested in the healthcare industry, would like to be on my feet all day constantly interacting with people that I can truly help.      However, my major marketing has almost no science background.  I have read that there are some accelerated nursing programs, but it still takes a long time to complete especially if you did not take science classes in college.      Can anyone give me advice about this? I am totally lost about what I want to do, and the constant rejection after rejection of jobs related to my major is making me start to think its more than just a bad economy, it was a bad choice of major.

The guy I interviewed with said, "We're calling people around 5-6 tonight and then sending e-mails to people who didn't get in and people we might hire at a later date tomorrow."

20090219121743AAraHwd	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Ridiculous mortgage relief?	If I am correct,I heard that folks who hold a mortgage higher than their house value will get a refinance or reduction in their payment to be equal to 1/3 of their income.  if this is true, why on earth would this be allowed to happen.  Because their value has gone down, that does not mean their payments have changed? does it.  I purchased a house with payments 1/3 equal to my income.   I suppose I should have bought that house that was another $50,000 more  than I could comfortably afford, so I could get the gov to establish a new rate/payment for me.  I thought I was being responsible by buying that little ranch, boy, I should have bought the big house on the corner and had my payments reduced to reflect my income. I am really confused about this.. Is it true.

20090203111743AA9ebFg	Business & Finance;Corporations	What do you think of the eBay/Paypal holding policy for sellers?	IMO, it's total bs. As a buyer/seller (mostly seller), I find it very difficult to sell entities such as televisions, computer towers, and/or anything else that's heavy due to eBay's 21 day holding policy.      It's clear that the shipping is included in this policy. However, Paypal/eBay decides to put a hold on that as well. So lets say that a person sells his 47" TV to pay for his college books. That seller must find the 150ish extra bucks for shipping, as he cannot use the shipping paypent that was provided by the seller due to the hold.      They claim to release holds 3 days after one receives good feedback form the buyer. However, it's rare that a buyer will leave feedback right away for their new item. Most buyers only get on to get what they want; thus, they aren't going to bother leaving feedback until they login to eBay to purchase another item.      Paypal is also a broker. This means that they collect interest on whatever money they are holding. While they might not get a whole lot by holding 300-400 bucks for that 30 days, multiply that by the THOUSANDS of users in the same situation.      I've been a PayPal/eBay member since 2002. It's clear that I'm not going scam anyone, as shown in my 100% feedback. This is 100% pure bs. I just wish some other auction would blast off in popularity ;/      It's just another way for them to get even more money.      What do you think?

I know no one here can tell me for sure I was just looking for people with experience with this.

The result:negative 49 dollars and growing!!. This was not my fault, however. I reviewed my debit card charges and realized that Jack-in-the-Box charged me three times for the same order! So when I made my next purchase with my debit card I went negative.  If Jack-in-the-Box hadn't charged me 3 times for that one order, I would have had enough money for the purchase that made my account go negative. Shouldn't Jack-in-the-Box have to pay me back the 49 dollars? What should I do? How do I do it?.. thanks.

20090203110754AAB6Zxd	Business & Finance;Credit	The Debt Collector says let your tax return work for you we want to give you 50 perc discount, how to resond?	This has been a battle for more than a year. At the beginning they have been asking for full amount and I wrote them letters saying I can't afford to pay it in full because I make very little.  I said to them in a letter that I can only pay this off in small amounts, and I would put a money order in the mail every month for 80 dollars or so.  Just recently I put another 25 dollars in the mail.  Now they are saying let your tax return work for you will give you 50 perc discount off 800.  so i would have to pay 100 in 5 payments which will make it extra 100, or I could just pay one payment of 400. I have just one week to respond by the 14th which is 30 day limit on this response.They are going after this stimulus check that people get from tax return..What they don't know is that my rent is like 850 and plus 50 for mailbox and 80 cellphone..my roommate just lost his job, I live with him, he has the lease on his name and i am paying full rent for him giving him cash i wrote out receipts for that..the lease is still on his name..can i just send them a copy of the lease and what a receipt of what i paid my roommate outlining the total amount of my living expense and ask them for a bigger discount than 50 percent?..Certify the letter and ask for a response?  The question is since my tax return i have worked very little my expense is big, Are they able to give me a 65 ercent discount or 75 discount.  Is there any laws making me elegible for a bigger discount than just 50 percent out of the amount owned which is 800 dollars. Should I just write them another letter or should i just send this 400 and ask for confirmation receipt and an update of their records? I feel like i should write them something because i have been sending them payments monthly with a little note attached to it and they totally ignored me.  What is the best thing to say to them making them aware that i know my rights.

I received a ticket in San Diego of 2003 that I forgot about for "disturbing the peace."Originally for $225. I think I made a payment on it a few years ago but forgot about it. In 2007 I moved to Billings, MT. In June 2008 I moved back to San Diego. I've struggled the last 6 months trying to find a job and make ends meet. I've gone through several temp positions. I finally got a semi permanent position in December. Today I received a notice that they are going to be garnishing my wages by 25% to pay off a $542 bill. They took over a hundred dollars this payperiod and will continue to do so till paid.(Over $400 a month) and they say I owe $542. I can make smaller payments easy but 25% is really going to hurt me. I'm barely making ends meet...I just got the job, an apartment, and transportation. I can't afford them to take very much...at least not this month when I am just getting on my feet. I know this my negligence but things are just starting to turn around for me and I can barely afford my regular bills.  Is there a way to dispute this or have them lower the rate? Can I still set up a payment plan of some sort?
