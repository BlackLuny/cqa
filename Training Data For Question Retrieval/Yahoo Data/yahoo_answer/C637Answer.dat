yotUSWcIaa	hmmm.  I know this isn't much help, but I can't really think of much.  I would try and catch up with some work or do some extra.<br>  It's difficult, but try to be a little less clingy. Not talking to him constantly doesn't mean you can't still think about him. :)<br>  <br>  EDIT:  maybe you could join some kind of club/group or something or take up a new hobby? Ask for more hours at work?  You get the bonus of more pay with that one.<br>  There's always 'me time' as well I guess...|`|RZl7aPxnaa	I can tell you are a full time student and hold down 2 jobs you are very active and feel you need to keep your time occupied. have you thought about spending time with some of your friends. if you have a best friend hang around with them and just have fun.|`|HosJ3bNgaa	party

b8VRlStoaa	What it will really come down to is what she can convince a judge is in the best interest of the child. Just another case of governmental intervention into our private lives.|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	I don't think she can without your signature.  I know for my ex to take my daughter to Mexico or Canada he needs my signature.  I will not sign.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	No your signature is needed, along with your passport number I believe. But that is to get a passport for your daughter, if she has one already, then no I don't think you could stop your ex taking her....<br>  <br>  Edit: I don't like to say it, but I suppose you could report her for kidnapping if she successfully gets out of the country. Although the impact of that on your daughter may not be good....  You mention this army guys moves around the country... but abroad? Does your ex go abroad with him on his postings because that is a little out of the norm.|`|L4rlu2BDaa	You will have to take her to court and ask a judge to determine whether she can take her daughter with her. The judge will determine whats best and make a decision.|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	Unless you have signed over your parental rights, then no she cannot.
AA11509996	I actually really like your ideas. That sounds very refreshing for a summer wedding and cute.<br>  You are a bit behind getting the dresses but honestly i don't think its that late. If anything, you can rush your order. Set up your appointment ASAP and speak to the lady helping you about delivery times. Speak to the manager of the store to make sure.<br>  I think you'll be fine. Congrats.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I don't know, I think you should have them stick with the same color and get different dresses.  if you let them pick the color, you could have 2 girls in one color and then 2 girls in 2 other colors.  that wouldn't look right.  pick a color and tell them to pick any dress from david's in that color.  then order them all at once so they're dyed the same.|`|w1necKzYaa	Your almost screwed! you should have made the appointment last month! you will have to Rush Like tomorrow to get the dresses on time!|`|xuiSfzgraa	Why don't you pick one of the colors for them to wear and let them pick the style that they wear.  That way you don't have so many colors yet they can still wear a style that they feel comfortable in.|`|wADnvKGFaa	I think different shades of blue sound pretty!  Everyone does the same color-different dress thing these days.  Do what you want!<br>  <br>  PS-get them into Davids asap!!!|`|XLXNwuX3aa	I think your intentions are good, but your pictures could be a disaster.  What if one girl chooses Mermaid and the other three choose Pool?  unless she is your maid of honor, it will look strange.  You should assign the color and dresses.  All of you should go to the salon, try on dresses and TOGETHER select the colors/dress styles.  It is great that you want to give them choices, but ultimately this is your day and your choice.  Letting them play a role in the decision making is great and commendable, but again, this is your day.   As things are, you have opened yourself to all kind of problems...  Also, I would get on this A.S.A.P!  Good luck and congratulations!
Whd6tqLzaa	Talk to your husband, you said you love him, but you are acting as if you are scared of him or rather I think scared of loosing him. How come you couldn't call or talk to the gf directly? Instead of sending an anonymous letter! If your husband still continues to contact or see this woman after you've confronted him, you should dump him. He is cheating on you and is arrogant.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	Okay.<br>  <br>  Your husband is having an affair with a divorced woman with kids who doesn't know that he is married.  So, in my opinion it is your husband you need to be confronting and dealing with.  Your husband has been stringing you both along, but you are willing to forgive him and cut him some slack.  He's been duplicitious to both you and this other woman.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd go and confront him and pack my bags and move on.  He wants to have his cake and eat it too and live this double life without any consequences.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Sounds like she already lost her husband. He's a lying, cheating bastard. Divorce his butt and go find yourself a real man who actually will want to make you happy and love you the way you deserve.<br>  <br>  Even if the wife succeeds in breaking up his relationship with his gf, he will likely just move onto someone else. Why stay for that sort of misery?|`|OHfZFR31aa	You are trying to confront the wrong person. You've already tried to contact her and she doesn't believe you. He's probably told her that you are his ex-wife who is stalking him and tries to ruin any relationship. He is lying to her<br>  <br>  You need to confront him and kick him out. It's not her fault. He's the liar and the cheater. Why do you not want to lose him? He doesn't love or respect you one bit|`|f6YsGOynaa	Wife is naive to think other woman does not know husband is married.  Other woman just doesn't care and knows that wife will eventually grow a backbone, get fed up, and kick husband out.  Husband will end up in poor house from child support payments, and also helping other woman raise her own kids.  <br>  <br>  Justice will be served.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Wife has a screw loose if she still loves her man this much. She needs to lose him. Why would she send a note to the girlfriend anonymously? Why not just tell her the truth? I'd feel for the g/f as well but I'd also kick the bum to the curb. He's trash.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	Since the wife knows this as fact she should confront only the husband.  If she loves him as much as she says she will know it's up to the husband to end the relationship.  Losing him may happen despite whatever the outcome is.  Her self respect is gone and she should realize whether she loses him or not he's a piss poor partner that doesn't care much about his relationship if he's not willing to end his affair.  The other woman may be in denial, may not care either way or may enjoy being a mistress.|`|AA12159712	If the guy has already been confronted and doesn't stop, and the wife wants to continue the marriage, then she must confront the woman with the facts and show he is married. she must show the woman that he isn't planning on leaving the marriage for her. This has to be done face-to-face with facts in hand for sure-fire proof.  But why she is so afraid of losing him is beyond me, unless it is strictly for financial security over love.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	Wife should leave. Here's the thing: It's obvious that you love him, and he loves you just enough to deny it, so you should pack up and go. Tell him you are giving space to work this out and decide what he wants to do. Move on with your life while you are waiting for that to happen. It seems harder than it is, but you may realize after a while that you deserve better.|`|LJ2OqF1saa	She cares but he doesn't....hummmmm.  I can't understand why a woman would want to remain with a cheater, when she knows he is cheating.<br>  <br>  I would start tracking them, and show up where they are, such as a restaurant, and walk up to them, and say oh, are you a client of my husbands? or something of the sort.....and see what happens....usually the other woman will be shocked, and get angry at him, then the wife says, see you in divorce court.....oh yeah take pictures of them, so that you will have all the proof needed to get as much money as possible.|`|6XKlW3lyaa	You got to do what you got to do.  Maybe you have to find her and have a face to face.  I would avoid talking to her while he is around, but if that has to be...    Maybe embarrasment is enough to stop him?  Call his mother.   A mother is like a moral compass for men.  If she cant set him striaght... then you got to leave.|`|2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	Give her the address and invite her to come knock on the door when both of you are home.<br>  Of course, I agree with the other answer.  Why would you want to stay with someone who has an affair with someone else?|`|mCM363I9aa	Wife should stay away from her man temporarily until husband learns his lesson. If husband chooses GF over wife then that would be his loss. Wife should not pity GF since GF knows exactly what is going on but probably won't admit it.|`|e4SflIigaa	WIFE IS STUPID,, Husband is a CHEATING ON YOU!!!!<br>  <br>  Move on, don't be a door mat.. you need to speak to your CHEATING HUSBAND. not the other woman. she has nothing to do with this,|`|djUMvICoaa	She's already lost him.  He's using her because he knows she's vulnerable, she thinks she needs him in her life.  He has no reason to fear anything, she will cling on forever.  This woman has to get some self respect so that others will respect her also.   Right now she is the doormat to the next woman he is going to use and a soft place to land if he gets rejected from any conquest.|`|2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	you got her phone number girl, use it. Shoot give it to me and ill call her. Im good with words and Ive done it before.  Its not fair to either of you. especially not to you. You really want your man back then end their relationship. He cant have his cake and eat it too.|`|kqSTDuA6aa	You have the call records! Call her! Introduce yourself and politely inquire as to when she will be coming to pick up his things. If she has any self-respect, she won't want his lying a** either. And to be honest, it won't be the last time he does this. Espcially if you allow it by staying with him. You have got to respect you now, cuz he certainly does not. I've done this! The look on his face when you say, "So, I had the best coversation w/ (name) today, and we've decided that neither one of us wants you anymore" is PRICE-LESS!!|`|pn2t0gejaa	I can't believe you want that guy .If your ok with him having affair then let him if not kick him the hell out she will find out|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	wife should get a clue and realize that he does not love her. She should leave him.|`|doM7kDUDaa	confront them with an Elbow Drop!!!!|`|AA10659796	Well, let me put this other way around!!<br>  What if you could not know this.<br>  The very first thing you should know that having a girlfriend is not a sign of danger always.<br>  Do you know human nature???<br>  The only thing which keep you connected is no/less knowledge.<br>  <br>  The moment a woman and man are met closely and been together in bed, it's started the end of the loving relation. <br>  The moment a man has seen a woman naked, interest goes off.<br>  You know why in India, marriages are so long and normally life long? this is because husband and wife always meet each other in night time and even in most cases in dark room. this is obviously because of our culture and join family situation. and till the time that man has not seen his wife fully naked in his full of eyes and normally it never happens sometime, the joint; the lust is there.<br>  don't you feel a husband also needs independence.<br>  have you ever asked why do you go on tours and parties, just because to have a change.<br>  that affairs should be taken in positive way.<br>  aren't you happy that even after this affair your husband is taking same care of you. you would not feel any change even unless you would not have seen those emails and phone calls.<br>  that proves that your husband is still same attached with you. may be that affair he is carrying on is due to off his emotions.<br>  did you try to find out, that was there a corner where you left him untouched - emotionally, behaviorely, sympathetically, lovingly or ..........<br>  TRY TO FIND THE ANSWER FROM YOU, I HOPE YOU WILL BE CALM AND RELAXED, IF YOU ANSWER YOURSELF HONESTLY, AND NOT CHEATING YOURSELF.

SW17FGBoaa	I totally get where you are coming from here, but remember she is licking him not the other way round so he probably didn't even know what she was doing while he was asleep! I've seen loads of photos with people being silly and licking each others faces just for a stupid pose for the camera. It normally doesn't mean anything, its just a laugh. <br>  Have a chat about it, (don't accuse him, try and explain what you mean) and see what he says. I hope it goes well for you.|`|ryOXYF8uaa	okay slow down honey, you wont get anywhere if your as angry as you sound.<br>  <br>  you obviosly dont trust this guy or you wouldnt be checking up on him in the first place. in the past i have accused my bf of things like that, just to find out there was nuffing going on and i just made myself look stupid.<br>  if you dont trust him then maybe you should be with someone else<br>  <br>  xxxx|`|8hyxabYOaa	honestly, it seems like YOU are the one with the problem here. dont rush to defend yourself on that one, because its obvious your self-esteem isnt very high, or else you wouldnt feel so threatened.<br>  if your constantly getting pissed off about another girl, your just showing your boyfriend your insecure and you dont trust him. thats recipe for a break up hun. you need to face that if you actually trust your boyfriend like you SAY you do, you need to act like it.|`|0Of1i0Ruaa	Take a bit to calm down and then give him a call and ask him about it.  Get his side of the story.|`|b7vYsbYNaa	your not being a jealous cow! confront your boyfriend he is out of order, and even if he was drunk he needs to learn to control himself.|`|Dxlt3jcqaa	I wouldn't be impressed with his behaviour, but i'm not sure what you could do about it.|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	call him and talk|`|vmzHbRt2aa	do whatever time demands you to do....|`|YKCIubvKaa	Ok take a breather because your gonna need it.<br>  Call him up (hopefully you catch him at a good time) and tell him there is something you really want to talk about. Ask him if he's cheating on you. Just ASK do not point out any evidence because he will probably start yelling or hang up. After say thank you and that you trust him. Than let him know that you hope if he ever gets feelings for someone else just to tell you. There is no advantage to hanging onto someone you don't truly love and that you would handle it much better if he just comes right out and tell you that there is someone else in his eyes. Try staying as calm as you can and don't cry.<br>  If it goes well say thank you for listening and apologize if you hurt him. And TELL him that you get very jealous when he hangs out with this girl. Even though you trust him its just a feeling that over comes you no matter how hard you fight it. Hopefully he will love you and care for you enough to maybe distance himself from it.<br>  <br>  Honestly deep inside you know the answer. This way is only to see if you can make it work. If you don't truly trust him or truly believe he is in the wrong. End it. I'm sure you'll find someone you can trust more and who will love you enough not to put you through this.<br>  <br>  Only a suggestion. Wish you luck in love.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Well, you should have known if your boyfriend was a party animal or not before letting it get to you...and it kind of sounds like he is...<br>  <br>  If thats not the type of guy you are into, you should probably let go of him and find someone else...College students OFTEN go to parties...Doesn't mean they are all orgies...<br>  <br>  And as someone said, if this WASN'T just that your boyfriend had too much to drink and he was screwing around on you, he wouldn't put it on Facebook for you to see it...|`|MHg9JhEKaa	That one photo doesn't mean anything, how could he have had any control over it when he was drunk and asleep?

You have good reason to be jealous! He would cheat if she would be with him. I'd be careful with this one. You have every right to be angry.

You need to fully trust the person you are with, or else, it isn't worth the time and aggravation.|`|B3cPFhssaa	She's only licking his cheek,they're not kissing.<br>  It's just a bit of drunken fooling around,and anyway if he's asleep in the picture what's the issue?<br>  It's not like he was aware of what she was doing and not telling her to stop.|`|Zca1PGERaa	calm down remember in the photo he is asleep shes making a joke and someone is taking a photo That Is All<br>  <br>  do not worry its been put in a public place to make fun of him being drunk xx|`|RTCKiu03aa	first if you weren't angry above seeing this girl with your boyfriend it would show you didn't care about him your boyfriend wont be happy about being accused of being unfaithful just talk to him and say you had a normal human reaction to the situation|`|q85qi9Jvaa	If he really cared about your feelings he wouldn't let a pic like that get out there. in fact he wouldn't have got himself into that situation in the first place.

If he apologizes and gives you reasonable explantation, kep on going with the relationship but if he doesn't and gives you obscene answers then it's time to break up, even if you don't want to, if you keep going like this he's going to hurt you in the long run. If he is not willing to be honest then he is not worth your time.|`|a9LYDdT2aa	You need to trust him, he probably didn't tell you because he believes you don't trust him. I hang out with guys, but I don't do anything and my boyfriend doesn't freak. It is pretty messed up he didn't tell you though. Just talk to him about it before you do something drastic.|`|oYm8UyZxaa	Ask him where he was esturday and if he says something different then i would just say 'oh, well (whoever told you) said you were at some girls house' and then see what he says, if he still denys it ask the person who told you where she heard it from and who he was with. Ask those girls.|`|OGkPeww1aa	Honestly, he should be confident enough to tell you..........and for that matter ASK you.

If you can have your wedding any day but Friday or Saturday you can save hundreds of dollars.|`|AA11447210	Saturday is the most common....a day most people are off work, but less likely to interfere with religious services than if on a Sunday.<br>  <br>  However, every day of the week has been used for weddings. Do what works best for you and the groom...and consider how many of your desired guests would be able to attend on the day you choose.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	Probably 75% of weddings are on a Saturday since that is a convenient day for everybody, but you can sometimes get better deals with the venue or vendors if you go with a different day.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Most people have them on Saturday.

Also, if you choose other less popular days like Tuesday or something like that the wedding costs for venue are less expensive in most cases.|`|h3NJO9dWaa	Usually on Saturdays because most people don't have to work and school is out. Friday night is perfect for the rehearsal dinner and Sunday leave for the honeymoon. <br>  However, vendors know this so Saturday is also the most expensive day to get married.|`|Drw4Gg1Daa	Usually Saturday.  But if not many people have to travel far, a Friday night or Sunday afternoon is usually cheaper.

S5x6KNHraa	why would u let something so Minor come between u and your friend is she really your friend or u jealous of her|`|AA11303010	She needs approval-as do you. According to your other question you are getting your approval through sexual means, while she is getting hers through lying.<br>  You two can help each other. Support your friend. She needs people to compliment her body. Show her that she is more than just a body-can she sing, draw or does she have another talent? Raise her up!|`|hHndD5SEaa	Shes obviously insecure in herself to say she carries on this way - just do your best to let it go over your head..... maybe tell her that she doesnt have to prove herself to you - and that it might be nice if ye could talk about something other than her?<br>  xx|`|q8eue7CRaa	She's SUPER insecure, which is why she's saying she is this size and blabbering about her make-up. Keep mum - be the adult. Who cares what her size is, really! She will grow out of it when she gets some confidence.|`|JZPwEz2waa	omg <br>  im italian gurl<br>  and that is the same description of my classmates<br>  it is indecent<br>  people doesn change anymore!<br>  listen....are u sure she is not interesting to anyone? well, start to open her eyes, she will be hurt ? dont worry <br>  this is the life|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	why do you care if she says she's an 8 but really a 14....maybe you should encourage her to lose some weight or tell her she looks nice.|`|yoz5UbQkaa	you should just drop it because this will hurt your friendship.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Well okay she talks about herself a lot; if that's not okay with you then don't be around her anymore. Hang out with your other friends and just be friendly but you don't have to be best friends.|`|dcovK6oqaa	So what if she doesn't want to tell people what size she wears. Its that more important to you than being her friend. many women don't like to talk about their Weight, and many even lie about it.  Maybe guys like her because she has other good qualities besides her looks.and many people lie about their Weight and size.  I don't see what is the big deal about it. some women who are size fourteen are very attractive.  and you can find women who are size small and aren't.
pR0pJNJkaa	Honestly dude...cut your losses and find something new. You are young enough to do this. Listen to your gut because she will ruin you for your future. You need someone who is as passionate about you as you are about her. It seems she is trying to cling to her ex (even as friends) is a disrespect to you. He obviously wants more and will play the friend role and always be a wedge between you guys and any real growth you could have with her.Move on. You obviously are a good dude and you can find a woman who values you enough to go all out like you are.|`|WO3dtNB5aa	i think she's just trying to string you along. go with your brain and leave her--you'll find someone better!|`|lHQmFQOTaa	I think you answered your own question, she is lying and most likely cheating on you with her ex. The draw of physical attraction and the good memories are what we want to hold on to. I did that for 7 years with my ex. Where did it get me, NO WHERE! You sound like a really nice guy, who deserves someone who will treat you the same. Though, you either can be strong and cut off all ties, listen to your friends. Or you don't and just keep getting hurt. There are too many people out there who do not care and just care about themselves.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	You already know what to do - move on. She moved out on you and is attempting now to let YOU down easy just like she did to her bf. If she still wanted to get married, she would still be living with you. Consider that her current methods with you might be similar to the one she is also using with her ex bf. You're her next "best friend" kind of relationship.
90d0d8923da1d8c56348bd637a3a3067aa	You have to confront your best friend and tell her what you feel. If you guys have been bff's for a long time then she will surely understand. Sometime's we have to stand up for ourselves. Always being too nice will just make us easy catches for selfish people like tht friend of yours whose trying to steal your bff. Just talk to your bff, tell her whats going on and just hope for the best because sometimes our friends should understand us and know who's true and whose not. Don't let others influence the people who you value the most in a bad or aggravating manner. Stand up for yourself and stand up for what you beleive in!!!|`|mIY4ev9waa	Tell your best friend how you feel, and whenever your other friend comes around you and your bestie, just smile, don't say anything to her and just keep talking to your best friend. That way, the other friend can't say anything.<br>  <br>  Im not sure if my one helped, but I hope it did! :)
JhvqUvlsaa	I'm sorry Alicia for your loss. When I was a senior in high school we lost a classmate and his best friend would hold his football jersey in his hands and cry and cry and cry. Gary was in a car accident too. It was really sad. So I have been there myself. Seeing Eric cry like that was really sad to watch.<br>  Like another person said; time heals all wounds. I might also suggest writing letters to Joey; goodbye love letters. Either blog them or write them in a card like you're actually going to give them to him. Tell him you love him and miss him. Tell him you hope he is in peace. Tell him anything you like.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest getting grief counseling; a lot of people in our school got grief counseling after Gary died cuz it was so sudden and tragic. This does wonders for a hurting soul.<br>  <br>  And I'm sure your parents feel bad for your loss too; let them reach out and love you. Maybe your family can get together with Joey's and hold a candlelight vigil. Wouldn't hurt.<br>  <br>  Take care Alicia sweetheart.|`|S5x6KNHraa	time heals hurt just stay busy and be positive u will start to feel better|`|0Of1i0Ruaa	One day at a time.  Find a friend you can talk to.  You will never forget him, but it will get easier.

I hate people that say, "Oh, god says that a woman has to obey her husband" as if he actually said that. And what if you don't believe in your god?|`|Slr6jtMGaa	I disagree....i know it's your vows....and you might not be comfortable with it.....but it says in the bible to obey your husband, as long as he is in God's will.....i.g. he can't tell you to go jump off of a bridge.....but he makes most of the decisions.....<br>  <br>  I respect what God intended a marraige should be.....he had a reason for saying that....|`|RaWIRGYmaa	We are writing our own vows, so we're not really going that route.  <br>  <br>  However - I don't have a huge problem with the word obey, as long as BOTH partners say it.  It's a partnership - give and take.  One person should not have to be submissive to another's dominance.|`|wADnvKGFaa	Nope!  Obey is old and out dated!  Don't say anything the you're not comfortable with!  Also, the phrase "I now pronounce you MAN and wife"  is done too.  Now it Husband and wife.<br>  <br>  These are your vows and you only say them once, so make them special to you and your fiance.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	I had them in my vows.  I wanted my wedding ultra traditional, and didn't want any words changed.  I am still happily married, and don't regret having the word included.|`|AIQ6taIUaa	Sure.. women can get away without saying it.  But ask a man if he can get away with not obeying his wife.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'll have it in my vows.  It says "obey".  Not "Obey every command".  You're over analyzing the phrase.|`|AA12392393	We said Love, Honor, and Cherish in our vows and were pronounced Husband and Wife.<br>  <br>  That was 24 years ago and still in Love.<br>  Honored every day, and Cherished always.|`|xuiSfzgraa	I am getting married in August and do not plan on having "obey" in my vows...It sounds too much like something you would say to your dog...|`|JIjuNh9Maa	i want obey to be in my vow. <br>  i think its important that a wife be submissive to her husband and obey his wishes|`|AA11895162	It's vows, not vowels.<br>  <br>  Maybe you've been watching too much Wheel of Fortune! LOL|`|uszV7NEFaa	I definitely do not plan on saying obey on my VOWS.|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	I don't plan on saying Obey at my up coming wedding.  The only weddings I've been to recently where they still use those terms are very religious ones.<br>  <br>  Edit:  See post above me as proof lol.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Seriously, is that even in the VOWS anymore?  I have attended countless weddings since I was very young and they only time I have ever heard that phrase was on TV.|`|P3e2kJtwaa	I definitely plan on saying obey in my VOWS.  I have no problem with doing what my hubby asks of me, as long as I know that he respects me and would never ask anything degrading of me.<br>  It's in the Bible, and I plan on living those words, too. :)<br>  Sorry if you don't like it, it's a personal preference.  You could always come up with your own vows :).|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	absolutely not.  it's antiquated and a throwback to times when women were property.  they shouldn't say 'man and wife' at the end of the vows either, it should be 'husband and wife'.|`|AA11312653	I believe that distasteful parts of the traditional vows, like obey and give away, should be discreetly edited out.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I think you need to get the spelling right first; LOL!

See if she's willing to make a few small changes.  If not?  Kick her out.  You're 21.  You don't need that kind of garbage.  I'm 25 and my ex was the same way.  Instead of kicking her out I just moved out.|`|yte0BzXKaa	She should have a job if shes with you, but if shes using you for your home and treating it like a piece of **** then break up with her, kick her out and get a restraining order before she tries to kill you.<br>  <br>  She sounds like an idiot, please get her out of your life.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	this sucks I've been there, let her know that its not working out . she hates her step father is not your fault its hers. her life will suck for a while or your life will suck for ever ? give her the boot you'll both get over it.<br>  good luck bro|`|b1coALxbaa	tell her what you just said in this question.  and suggest that perhaps she would be happier if she had her own place to be all ocd about.<br>  <br>  This is assuming she has a job and pays half of the rent, if she doesn't then make her get one and pay that should be a requirement for any roomie whether they're your girlfriend or not.|`|AA11786477	"Kick her"  out? That is a harsh term to use on a GF. <br>  Talk to her 1st. let her know that moving in wasn't the best thing for the relationship.

WpCwTxN5aa	The more common situation is girls complaining that their bf is only interested in bjs.<br>  <br>  It's understandable that he wants some variety, but it's not like he can complain that he's not getting laid.  If you don't mind giving him the bjs, he shouldn't mind receiving them, even though it's to the exclusion of p-v sex.|`|4PK0hiWeaa	Sex is better but most girls don't even give bj's so you're doing him a great service.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	but he's not getting what he wants.  that's why he wants intercourse.<br>  <br>  believe it or not when guys get something "exotic" all the time, then they develop a desire for the plain and ordinary because that becomes the new exotic.<br>  <br>  If you're not ready for intercourse then don't have it, but understand a BJ is not a substitute for intercourse, it's more of an appetizer before the meal.<br>  <br>  and uh, your hymen may be intact but you are no longer sexually pure, so you're not a virgin any more.|`|7vt21U1naa	Not really guys are weird.

Don't do it until you're ready, though.|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	ummm i guess...|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	What are you? His sex toy? <br> You are virgin that really means in your case that you are young. Because these kind of girls can't last long as a virgin. I think he don't really love you. He just want sex. B j is not good for health, stop it. I didn't mean 'stop b j and start sex with him.  <br> I think you don't like him also, because if you love him you will not scare this long to do sex with him, also b j only gives satisfaction to him, so its a one way track.<br> Just dumb him and start looking for a good guy.|`|AnfbrZFuaa	He should feel happy by just getting bj's from ya. He shouldn't want to make you feel like you need to gave sex wit him, he should be letting you go at your own pace. If you're just nervous, but want to do it, then do it. If he doesn't like it cuz you don't know what you're doing, that's his loss. But don't worry, he should lead you if he knows it's your first time. In fact, that might make it even more run for him to teach you.|`|OGkPeww1aa	Ummm, you dont even have to give him a BJ in all seriousness.....a relationship should mean more to him than a BJ. And, at first they will seem great to him, but eventually he will want the real deal.......BUT, its not what he wants (only), its what YOU want. If you dont want to have sex, then you dont have to! He should be good without the BJs, he should be great with them. If he wants more, thats human, but you dont have to give more.|`|UtS6Uesqaa	I think that he needs to be happy with getting the bj's I mean come on get over yourself...I don't think that you should have sex with him until you are ready...and he shouldn't be trying to pressure you into it..If he loves you he will just stick with the bj's for now and wait for you until you are ready....Hope this helps!|`|qKpgMkjSaa	To be honest, sex is good...really good! lol but omg it can be tiring, and don't do it unless you are ready. for that 21 r old who just waited welllllllll over a year that's ridiculous! me and my soon to be fiance waited about 6 months, but that's because we've both had our share of preciousness and wanted to wait till we were both in love. Once you bring sex into it if you already dont ahve a good foundation it can go down hill quickly! I love to give oral to a girl....mhmm lol :) but anyway there wil be like a weeks period here and there where neither one of us will want sex, just the intimacy of getting off with out it ie bj's, oral. but that comes from being 24 yrs old and having lost our virginity's a loooong time ago.<br>  <br>  Don't do it just for him! I actually wish I would have waited, cause I lost mine at 14 almost 15. You can never get it back!|`|xWq93Ckyaa	Do what you feel comfortable with, don't let him pressure you even if he's not forcing you to have sex with him.

It WAS, however, extremely premature for her to hop into the sack with an old flame so quickly. She wasn't thinking of your feelings then, was she?<br>  <br>  I think you should try harder to move on. This incident looks like something that will repeat over and over.|`|7w2kCTDJaa	If you guys were clearly on the outs, it's not cheating. But I know I would feel the same way as you though. I mean, you guys were broken up for 36 hrs & the first thing she does is run to another guy? I'd need some time to think as well.|`|OHfZFR31aa	She doesn't really love you if she was willing to sleep with another guy a day after you broke up. It doesn't matter that they went out before. If she really cared about you, she would have been so upset about the breakup that she wouldn't have even wanted to look at another man for a while|`|f6YsGOynaa	Wow...it didn't even take her a whole day to sleep with someone else when you broke up... she sounds like a piece of work.. or a piece of something else.  While technically it wasn't cheating, would you really want her back after it's obvious she had it planned before you even broke up?<br>  <br>  She's cheap and trashy... move on.  You deserve better.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	As you have already found love does not conquer all. There would be no divorces  if that was true because everyone is in love when they marry. I guess technically you were broken up but for only one day before she slept with someone. That does not mean she is not truly sorry and really loves you and wants you back. The real question is how you feel, not her.If you know you can never trust her again and that because of that you just couldn't get back with her....there's your answer. If you get back together and you still feel that way you'll just end up in an even more painful breakup.If it's your decision not to get back in a relationship you feel is doomed If that is the way you feel you need to tell her and cut off communication, it's better for both of you. If what she's told you is true she will be hurt but so have you been. No where does it say you have to make a decision that you know is wrong for you to make someone else feel better. If  you think you can get over the cheating then I think you should give it another try.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	She's a wreck now but you can bet she was planning this then. Sometimes people do things that no matter how hard they try they can't undo. This is one of those things in my book. I'd wish her well and move on. You'll never get passed it if you don't. Sorry for your loss.|`|mMBzpldbaa	if you were broken up at the time, then no she did not cheat on you. but if she slept with someone else that quickly, i doubt that you are the love of her life.<br>  <br>  i know this may be hard to hear, but i don't think you need to be with that sort of person.|`|l1KlZrAOaa	My first impression is she really wanted the other guy, he used her for a one night stand, he rejected her for any kind of commitment and now the only thing left is you!<br>  <br>  My advise...  find someone who will treat you like number 1!|`|mCM363I9aa	she should of kept her big mouth shut if she knew it was going to hurt you, she's obviously no good for you. Move on since there are plenty of fish in the sea. Good luck<br>  <br>  Change your number or  tell her to stop calling you.|`|vXFpzKRaaa	Even though you were broken up, if she's sleeping around already this just shows what her character is like.  If I were you, I'd stay away from her before she give me VD.  She didn't cheat but she's not one I'd trust.|`|WVcUweTEaa	So...I checked out "spikes" profile and guess what people...."spike" asked the very same question last week.|`|7K2HVodhaa	She sounds like a ****.|`|nE95Hnn5aa	If you guys mutually agreed to break up (for whatever reasons) then she went and had sex with another man, then that is not cheating.  Unless you were married to her, which doesn't sound like you were.  However, I know that it feels like cheating because your feelings are still strong for her and just because you agreed to break up that doesn't mean that your feelings automatically stops for her and vice versa.  It sounds like she allowed her emotional feelings to get the best of her and not only that, she was probably very vulnerable after the breakup.  If she truly believes that she made a mistake and really wants to make things work, then you have to make a firm decision.  If you still love her and want to make it work, then you are going to have to forgive her, move on from her mistake and be fully committed to making your relationship work.  If you still love her but know that you won't be able to trust her, then you should tell her that then break off all communication with her, at least until you can see, think and feel straight.  This may take some time, but you have to have a complete break in order for your heart to heal.  That is just the way love goes!  Whatever you decide, just don't half step.  It's not fair to you or to her!|`|kWzu5QU3aa	You were broke up when it happened, so it wasn't exactly cheating.  However, it would make me upset since she didn't wait too long, did she?  I would consider giving her another shot.  She could've been confused.  I don't think her having sex with someone negates her love for you.  It was a quick rebound thing....one she quickly realized was a mistake.|`|J9IXHDbRaa	When you're a woman behaving this way you're a whore; if you're a man behaving like this, you're considered a STUD.  <br>  <br>  That being said, if you really, REALLY care for each other, you need to sit down and talk it out.  Until you're blue in the face.  Really.  And, during that talk, all judgments need to be tossed out the window... read my first sentence again:  if it was you doing this to her, you'd be a stud.<br>  <br>  Think about it.|`|6XKlW3lyaa	If she couldnt even keep a man off her for 2 bad days, believe me on this one because i've been through the hurt, you gotta forget her.  IT's a tough few weeks at first, but it gets better.  Don't answer her calls, dont talk to her, dont meet her.  Write her out of your life.  Any continual contact makes it harder.  <br>  People make mistakes, but theres some mistakes that cant be forgiven.|`|8GfEEzzhaa	I dont think that a person who sleeps with someone else a day after a break-up is very dependable and I don't think she truly loved you if she did that. Probably she is sorry because right now she has nobody better, so she wants to use you as a last resort. Don't let her abuse your feelings.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	It's not cheating. You were broken up. Obviously you both needed time to decide how you feel about each other. Clearly you both decided you love each other. Don't let a good thing die over a moments indecision. We all feel that way sometimes. Give it time, you will too. Get back together.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	it is easy to say but it is very hard to do.  Doesn't matter how much you love her but if you ever get back with her you will end up hurting her and yourself.  Try to get over it, you deserve more than that.|`|ENZVi0Ptaa	It not techincally cheating if your broken up. But sleeping with someone else after breaking up a day before is disconncering. <br>  <br>  It impossible to be in a relationship if you can't trust someone|`|fE1GFxbRaa	together or not she still didnt wait enough.loose her dog!!<br>  plenty of women,or tell her to make it up to you by letting you sleep with someone else see how she likes it.|`|kqSTDuA6aa	Please refer question to Rachel Green and Ross Gellar.|`|ipGEVR29aa	what she did was cheating<br>  <br>  you guys should really have a calm talk and just tal|`|doM7kDUDaa	well que sera sera<br>  <br>  and its all fair in Love and War.|`|X2rmZ58iaa	She's scum.|`|2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	The ball is in your court. You have all the power now. Use it. <br>  If you want her take her back but sleeping with another person after a day is a true show of her character. people don't just make mistakes like that. It happens because they let it happen and in some cases wanted it to happen. forget her. there are tons of wonderful people out there, faithful, attractive, smart, it just feels like there isn't cause your focus is narrow. <br>  <br>  Open your eyes there's more out there and yes I definitely consider it cheating.|`|AA10097443	You want a mature answer..Are you sure..?..ok here goes..search your heart.. take time in a place that makes you calm..water music ect.. ask you heart.." Do I love her..?<br>  <br>  If the answer after you have done this comes back a very and i mean very strong..Yes..then learn to forgive... (but wait... 3 to 6 months..No sex.. just date all over again..kissing holding hands..dinner lunch fun stuff..if she can stay faithful to you and you the same..You will have your answer.
ctMLdGg9aa	just tell your family.  tell them he's the one you want to be with and that should be all that matters. tell them he doesn't care what religion or skin colour that you are and he's really sweet. introduce him to your family, i'm sure everything will go fine.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	I surely wouldn't begin by telling them you are "in love".  Every mature adult knows that is impossible.<br>  <br>  The truth is, you may not even like the boy after you meet him, so be very cautious, and do not be alone with him anywhere.<br>  <br>  Be truthful with your parents.  Tell them you have been corresponding with a young man (I hope he is) and that you would like to meet him and have them meet him.
jgRRsG8Daa	Pardon my saying so but you are what is commonly known as a "sentimental fool".I do not blame you.On the contrary,I would like to have a guy like you as my close friend because it would give me a <br>  sense of great security.I am not trying to flatter you but you seem to belong to that rare breed of pals who would stick by their friends in the classic way viz."through thick and thin".More's the pity that Murali has<br>  not realised this and dumped you .Console yourself that it is his loss.<br>  Your gain is that you have lost a friend who has forfeited the right to be called truly a friend.Stop moping and get out there.There's a big wide world out there where people like you are needed to bring home to <br>  folks the true meaning of the word "friend".Good Luck.<br>  Incidentally,I have been truly fortunate to be blessed with a few friends <br>  who would literally give their lives for one another,me included.|`|aVbWrsVOaa	i think you need to tell yourself that there is no use being such a great friend to this guy if he is going to be so mean back. you should move on and give your attention and caring spirit to a friend who deserves it. it will be hard cause you guys are obviously used to be friends but he isnt worth it.|`|grmvnXxEaa	i think now u should find anY other frd coz .according to me if a person doesn't respect u or ur feelings then its off no use to continue any type pf relation with that person.few years ago i also faced such situation,but now i understood that if a person does'nt give u a respect or plays with ur emotions then he /she is not at all a true person.so frd just njoy ur life By making other TRUE frds n d'nt worry abt ur frd coz ur spoiling ur life for that person who doen't care for u at all. so just NJOY kya pata yeh pal KAL HO NA HO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|COCVO3gcaa	Maybe get some new friends. Or give him the cold-shoulder back to see how he likes it. You could also confront him about his behavior. Ask him "Why are you avoiding me?" and if he says "I'm not, what are you talking abut?' insist upon a solid answer.|`|7XqsUQ7Uaa	first of all talk to him and appoiagise your mistake and the give me the best answerer ok and another one if even he talks to you badly dont get angry|`|yoz5UbQkaa	Apologize until he listens.|`|1l04qpOKaa	You are doing what a good friend should...not giving up. Obvisiously your friendship with him is important to you. Just give him time and space and eventually he will come around. Maybe apoligize once more and leave the ball in his court.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Tell him you apologize if there's anything you have done wrong and let him be for a while. Give him some space to cool off and if he returns ask him if he needs to talk about anything that might be wrong with the two of you or his life in general.<br>  <br>  If he never returns and acts like a good friend again then just let him go and find other friends to hang out with.
DJMPQlFDaa	I see it this way, even when I do divorce I had promised God that my husband and I are one. So I never plan on remarrying. How can you keep giving a piece of your soul to each woman to keep having it ripped apart piece by piece.|`|8GfEEzzhaa	When I get married I will make sure it is a person I will spend the rest of my life with. No matter at what sorts of lows we get to, I am not a quitter and will not divorce. Of course if the other party is so keen on divorce that it is unavoidable (which by the way won't happen since i will chose wisely), when I am divorced, that would be it. I will be in other relationships, but not marry again. What is a sheet of paper, when people don't respect what is in it?!|`|ZQE61wUZaa	I am on my second marriage.  I love him very much yes, but I would have never got married if I didn't have a young child.  I would have lived with him forever.  However, I don't believe in living together while raising young children.  Its a disgusting example to set for them and would feel like a broken home I suspect.  He is a great husband and fabulous step father to my son.  So unless he passed away and I had to move on (and I would I'm young) then no I would never get married again. My son is 17 now and he knows about the birds and bees.|`|lgBLl9gnaa	I wouldn't rule out YES or NO.<br>  <br>  All relationships need COMMUNICATION.  Sadly, in my 3rd marriage, we have leaking communication lines.  That is, he likes everything his way - my thoughts are secondary.  I don't feel comfortable discussing sensitive issues with him, because he will go into a rage display to impress upon me exactly how wrong I am.  Yeah, I know:  It's F'd up.<br>  <br>  If I had to do it over again?  YES, I'd consider marriage again... just not to him.  At the time, I didn't listen to my little inner voice... telling me to run.  Now, I wish I had.  I wish it every damn day.|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	I wouldn't...i have been married twice...the first was short and so "unsweet" the second i thought was "it" well....i have been dating and living with a guy for almost a year now....i love him to death but don't think i will marry him...we may be together for 30 years, but i am not sure i will get married again...i don't seem to be very good at it! (Marriage that is)   LOL|`|4RgXh3ftaa	Absolutely! Just because your last marriages failed for whatever reasons doesnt mean that it cant work out with someone else.

But I'm 47, probably a lot older than you.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	Yes I would. The one thing that I know from my two marriages is that they were not a complete waste. There were good times, and there was love. Just because they didn't last forever (one lasted 17 years) it doesn't mean they weren't good. The only thing I will do differently next time is that we will have seperate bank accounts, and one of my bank accounts will have the divorce money already in it. Hopefully it will bring me better luck next time.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	If you really know yourself and accept your faults, you can overcome your mistakes. And stop choosing woman who aren't good for you.<br>  I'm divorced twice, and I say I'll never get married again, but I also know that if the right person came along then I'd be open to it. But let me tell you, there better be not one single doubt in my head.|`|mAZi1eH7aa	2, 8 year marriages that fell apart. No infidelity on my part. I am now in year 16 of my third marriage. I do not regret it in any way and it is the best thing that ever happened to me.<br>  Don't be scared, be smart. Recognize the differences between love, lust, companionship and partnership, commitment and  stuck in a rut, being truly happy and being just okay or satisfied enough.<br>  My wife is 36 and I am 52. We are very much still in love.<br>  Accept them as is. You will not change them. You will, however, blend to each other. <br>  Have fun!|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I did. It was the best thing I ever did. The first wife became a cheating <br>  drunk. The secound became a holy roller after we got married.
p7Z5H8ftaa	She really likes you, and the fact that you havent asked her out probly makes her sad, and her saying hi less is asign shes giving up. hopefully your playful with her back, when her friend said she liked someone from another school she was probly saying that cuz she didnt wanna make it obvious she liked you, but the other friend said she likes noone so youd know she was open to a relationship. their not gonna tell you if she likes you cuz shed be really mad at them and embarassed. maybe tell her just be like over msn "i feel like you like me, and if you do i like you too, if not i feel stupid lol but you should tell me if ya do"|`|8ztWRIHMaa	try when you two are alone to hold her hand and if she respond trying kissing her and if she respond well then yes she do|`|5aXKo6uCaa	dude ask her out its the only way|`|kl1kzlzXaa	What are you waiting for?

K4ulbvUpaa	Of course, im sure you heard of people being unlovable! Right? If one doesn't love themselves they aren't happy, and if you are not happy how can you make someone else happy? And it's only human to doubt ones self beliefs but whatever the situation stay strong!|`|RZl7aPxnaa	as this also means you need to have respect for yourself before you can show respect toward others. this would also be seen as in with the same category as love yourself before you love others. for some people do not feel great about themselves for they see life as being a bad and a mean place, as they have grown up in such bad situations. as these types of people cannot show another person feelings if they do not have these feelings to show. but I do believe you do have these feelings, or you would not be worried about this. so do not worry, all people have doubts at times. but the problem may not be your problem it could also be the person you think you love. this has to work both ways or there may be problems in the future. these types of questions are a little hard to explain. but there can be two people, as one will not view things the same as the other for they may not care as strongly about the one than the other. but give them time as they may also learn from the other as to change their way as they tend to understand them more. live by the feeling you have inside you. and what you see as being right. that is all it means.|`|1JBf1vRMaa	no you dont have to love your self before you can love another..<br>  all you have to do it belive in your self and just go for it..<br>  a little bit of self confidence can go a long way..<br>  show your partner who you really are xx|`|ivsYJPx3aa	Fantastic realization ,, doult the best ,and all the rest .....in ..1980 something!!|`|2ZXt112Qaa	Yes. I will tell you why. If you have issues with yourself it will affect the relationship. My mom has  a very low self esteem and she has no idea how much she has affected my father. Her insecurities and they way she sees herself has an effect on the way she behaves and everybody around her. Let's just say that is hurtful when we see somebody we love that can't even love themselves.It makes us wonder if they value us, when they don't even value who they are.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	Probably.  I definitely think you need to be a complete person first.  If you don't know who you are then you could change dramatically during the course of any relationship, thus killing it.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Yes. Otherwise you will not be confident enough to be yourself, the one the other person fell for, but you might change and spoil the relationship.

(you can be friendly but the moment it gets to the point ur hiding something from ur boy its too far)<br>  <br>  2. NO jealousy games. let them know their the only guy for you, but if they dont want you then theres tons of guys to help you get over them.<br>  <br>  3.

I love it when I get suprises in my bookbag (college student), she suprised me with a game she made me, that was really sweet and it showed her how much she cared. even it was dorky for some it was something she made and it came from her heart.

O8TA4tMGaa	The best thing you can do for your  mother is tell her how amazing she is.  Tell her that she deserves the best.  Tell her that you love her because the real issue, in her marriage, is an issue of self love.  Believe it or not, it isn't your dad.  We teach people how to treat us and if your mother has been putting up with this type of behavior for the last 22 years, what she's been essentially telling your dad is that it's okay to treat her like this, that she'll still be here if he does and, essentially, that she doesn't deserve more than this kind of treatment from him.  <br>  <br>  Your mother is getting sick and tired because this is finally her time to wake up and ask some difficult questions: What do I deserve?  Am I willing to spend the rest of my life with this man living like this?  Am I happy?  What can I do for myself?<br>  <br>  You can support your mom, not by digging deep into her sadness but by uplifting her with your appreciation and gratitude.  Be the woman that she hasn't been able to.  Live your life and know that you deserve the best.  Enjoy the pub but also come home and tell your mother how much you love her, how wonderful she is, how much she deserves love and joy and peace.  Encourage and empower your mother and be there for her.<br>  <br>  Trust me when I say this: every woman has a lightbulb moment.  For some, it comes at 20, for others, at 40, for others at 60 but it always comes.  Support and love your mother and watch her grow!|`|m84Ml3Opaa	You should try spending time with your mom a bit to get her out of the house. Also you should tell your dad that he should take your mom out to a movie or something because she seems pissed about him neglecting her. After people have been married that long they have to think of ways to keep the fire burning.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	tell her to have an affair that should preoccupy her|`|sI7gq3B1aa	why not ask her if she would like to come for a bit x|`|JlDcVTVsaa	maybe you should arrange some days to go out with your mum?<br>  you dont need your dad there to take her out, just go out and have some fun time together. and show her that no matter what you will always love her and be there for her. <br>  <br>  If i was your mum i would be fed up too. <br>  I think you should also talk to your dad, and tell him as a woman, you can undrestand how bad your mum must be feeling.|`|0udjgaoBaa	Your mom is a grown women if she chooses to wallow in her unhappiness then thats her fault!

gndS3jslaa	I've been to more than five but less then 10 over my lifetime. I don't know the exact count. Three I was in the wedding parties, as a flower girl, holding the veil, bridesmaid. I liked my aunt's (I was six). I remember it well because I wore a puffy pink princess dress. I can't stand pink now, but at the time it was my favorite colour and I felt like royalty and chased the ringbearer around for most of the reception. :) I remember my father's third marriage/reception. Moderately enjoyable and mostly DIY. My step-sisters and I decorated and so on. A small reception of about thirty people. <br>  <br>  I can easily say that the best wedding was my best friend's wedding, however, that's me being biased. :) It was a lot of fun even with me spraining my ankle the day of, and moreso after she fired the DJ and stuck CDs in herself because he wouldn't play the music she wanted and played toons she told him he couldn't because it was requested. I think it was also my favorite because even with everything that went wrong leading up to and during the day of the wedding, we still made it happen. <br>  <br>  However they were all pretty much the same. My best friend's wedding wasn't supposed to be, but because of everything that went wrong at the very end, was forced to be like everyone elses.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	I've went to 4 just last year!  Overall, about 8, and mine is coming up this spring.  <br>  <br>  I've enjoyed pretty much all of the weddings.

One year from March to November I was invited to and attended over 16 weddings. I always have a good time at weddings.  They are what you make them.

It's about celebrating your friends or family so it should be a good time.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	you're right weddings are mostly the same conventional trite elements over and over again.  the cake, flowers, garter, DJ, photos, bad food, drinking, bridesmaids, awful tuxes, etc.  being a bridesmaid is fun tho because it's a day of pampering, hair and makeup etc.  so now when I go to a wedding I use it as an excuse to have a spa day and sometimes I think I hvae more work done than the bride herself!|`|2o3BHgCCaa	I think I have been to 6 (that I can remember).<br>  I thought they were all pretty good.

Before a certain age you don't pay attention, or you just don't care. Between the ages of about 10 and 18 I didn't go to any weddings. Nobody I knew got married; all my parents' friends were already married, and all my friends were too young. <br>  <br>  But since 2003 I've been invited to about 8 weddings, as my siblings, friends and cousins have all started settling down. It's a busy couple of years; last year I attended 3, this year I'm getting married and attending my cousin's wedding, and next year I'm invited to another one. <br>  <br>  I've loved every single one so far, and I can't imagine I'll get sick of them, because each one seems to be very different.|`|AA11895162	I've been to many many weddings over the course of my life and in addition had the pleasure of being an attendant to many weddings when I was a young girl (flower girl) and as a bridesmaid when I was a teen.<br>  <br>  I view weddings as a way of visiting with family and friends and I would encourage you to attend the weddings and take lots of pictures.  <br>  <br>  You will appreciate those memories in your later years.

819ad8842ebdf96b383c9430aef4be6eaa	Maybe it would be best to split up this point and put off the wedding.  If you are having problems forgiving him then that is a problem for the both of you.  He may be cheating with other people as well and you need to be concerned about your health.  If this woman "might" be pregnant than of course he was having unprotected sex with her, and perhaps others as well.  Get tested and don't sleep with him unless you have seen his results and you know for a fact that he is no longer sleeping with anyone else.    Like you said, think about your daughter and the lessons you want to teach her about how to be a woman.

Most won't, I know I don't unless I'm complaining about it.  May not be the best way but women tend to be WAAAAAY more detail oriented than men.  Or at least my woman is.|`|o1rzGR8kaa	Only big bugers, no can breath|`|sCBJHVtzaa	okay? I don't do that and I'm a girl, I look at little things but names don't matter, and colors of birth stones don't matter, I pay more attention to connection and what he does or what I do to put effort and to show that we love or like eachother. or whatever. So, like calm down I guess, how old are you? someday those things won't matter, and guys usually don't care.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	Not all guy do,, Most guys don't pay attention to that kind of stuff.

eVK2zZsOaa	If you are having difficulty getting pregnant maybe the two of you should seek medical help. There are doctors out there who can tell you which one of you is unable to produce a child. If you aren't ready to go to the doctor yet, just keep trying it may not be so easy for everybody to conceive.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	After seven years, it is time to go to a specialist, one of you has issues.  It may be a simple issue to fix, or it may result in going through IVF, but really the goal here is to be blessed with children, so do whatever it takes and soon you will know the unconditional love of having children.  Good luck to you both.|`|ymWkGqm7aa	Go and see your doctor. He will give you (or send you) a speciman bottle thingy to put your sperm in, which will be sent (or you take it) for a sperm count. It usually takes a few days for the results. If your sperm count is fine, then your wife will have to be checked out. I'm not sure what happens with her though. Good Luck! :) :) :)|`|CJvHQl5vaa	By "trying" do you mean you are just having unprotected sex, or that you are tracking your ovulation, making sure to have sex at the right times, etc?  If you have simply stopped using birth control and aren't getting pregnant, there are a lot of things that could be getting in the way, including simply a matter of timing.  <br>  <br>  Your wife is only fertile about four days per month, so if you just so happen to not have sex during those four days, then there is no way that you could be getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  I would get ahold of a book I love called Taking Charge of Your Fertility.  Usually half.com or amazon used sells it fairly inexpensively.  It will teach you how to chart your wife's ovulation cycle using a more effective method than those overpriced pieces of junk from the pharmacy.  It will help you track her fertility and know when to try, and it will teach you a lot about her body that you probably never knew.  Try that way for six months, and if that doesn't help you then absolutely get some help from a fertility doctor.|`|MuVKeK8faa	Go see a doctor??|`|mCM363I9aa	how long is a "while"?|`|emKXU1QFaa	I agree with Meri and would add that sperm potency decreases with each ejaculation.  So, when you find out when she is fertile you might have sex every other day around that time to get the highest/fastest sperm (plus sperm can survive in the body for several day).  If this doesn't work after a few months then you both need to go see a Dr.
B7kPUmUWaa	It's probably just one of those "I don't want him but I don't want anyone else to have him" type things. I could see myself being that way if God forbid me and my husband ever split. Once you have kids with someone I truly believe no matter how bitter the split or whatever, there is always that emotional connection through the kids. And kids would be a constant reminder that at one time, you had a great life with that person. That could make someone bitter. But it's her fault, not yours. She should know by now it's over between them and let you guys be happy!|`|Wwt72oPVaa	possibly she is. unless she is being a ******. i remarried after my first husband-been married for 5 years but i never have fallen out of love with him. and i left him! but you do need to put your foot down(or have him do it) there are some things that are not acceptable even though there are kids involved. she needs to know her place|`|2ASTKglDaa	Sometime's we woman can be obsessing. Why don't you make a date with her, the three of you go for a coffee and talk about it. Make her see how are things with you! <br>  Maybe being friendly will help<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Hey, I need some advice too. I would apprecciate if you go to my question and read it. thanx|`|e4SflIigaa	Why don't you ask her?|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	It's more likely deep hatred that makes her act that way. Especially if YOU were the cause of the divorce.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	If it is any consolation, you aren't the only one, even when there is no children, sometimes the ex is crazy and can't let go.
5r2Csdzwaa	You must be very young. I'm in my late forties and so is my wife. She lets me bang her in her sleep and we shag three times a week on top of that. So I'm a 5 banger on average. <br>  <br>  We shagged daily when we met at 23 but kids and work made that not as easy. That DOLT dreams I'm shagging her when I do it and she works her body almost as good as when she's awake.<br>  <br>  BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG!|`|POHWTDPRaa	You sound about 11, first of all, so I have a hard time believing this is a real question. On the off chance it is, I find that terrifying. Also, you can't take what you have heard as absolute law. Everyone is different. Your wife may very well be a randy old woman. If she does lose interest, you just keep your promise. It's a matter of how good a guy you want to be. A man is as good as his word. If you break it, you're as good as nothing. So you'll stay in a lot and pretend you're 15 again. I promise, you'll never go blind.|`|AA11982228	Become best friends with your right hand.  Then, if she loses interest, switch to your left hand...it'll be like boinking a stranger!<br>  <br>  p.s.  i'm certainly not "old", but at 46, I still can't get enough of my man!|`|vwuMTm7Saa	Women reach their sexual peak much later than men do.  Believe it or not, your libido will go down and hers will go up...  The question is really less about sex, though, and more about commitment.  If your wife was really sick for a long time and unable to perform for you sexually, would you seek out physical satisfaction elsewhere?  I think you may want to think about what it means to be married and the sacrifices that both of you need to make.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	well people say old men also dont want to have sex that often.<br>  <br>  it depends on the person, and her/his health.<br>  if you want your wife to still have sex with you when she is older, just take really good care of her now, so she wont get old so quickly, and she will stay healthy and energetic.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	If you keep her interested, it won't happen. Just don't turn it into a "wham-bam" kind of sex life, you have to work on keeping it good.<br>  <br>  I guess you'd call me old, at 47-- but I still want plenty of sex because my hubby makes the effort.|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Lots of old women want sex! Just stay in shape, usually their partner lets themselves go, then they don't want to have sex with them anymore. And vise versa.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	It's hard for me to believe you're actually married and asking such a foolish question. I'm 58 and having sex as much as I want. Most of my friend though started having ED problems years ago. That could easily be you by the way. 20 years down the road she could be the one asking this question because you can't make the little guy dance. Worry about making your marriage strong and not about how much you might or might not get in a few years.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	I feel really bad for your poor wife, to have married a man who obviously doesn't understand the vows he agreed to. Marriage is about being with each other forever and loving one another unconditionally... sex is a part of a relationship, not the sole reason for it. If all you care about is getting off, go move in at a brothel.|`|l1KlZrAOaa	What is your problem? It's a though you are predicting that your wife will loose her sex drive. How can you be sure that it won't be you. Then omg...  what will your wife do then?? You can't please her..  oh I know ...  she'll have to cheat on you!<br>  <br>   You're question is really stupid, just like my answer. Now I'll take the 2 points.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	i am 44 if you can not honor your promise to your wife then divorce her. why put her through that kind of pain?  I would not cheat on my husband if he could not have sex any more and i would not divorce him.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Viagra for women|`|WVcUweTEaa	What a Joke.  I guess you think with your "member" huh?|`|7K2HVodhaa	pig|`|qtlzdtMVaa	I'm 20 and a obviously a girl. All women are different, some don't want to have sex when your old because you get very tired easily. But some women love to have sex for exercise and obviously pleasure. You should ask her what she would feel in the future. Let her know how you feel and let her know that you still want to make love to her and only her. I mean that's what marriage is about, trust and honesty. =) GL|`|4DDSD9Syaa	Divorce her then. Tell her the truth that you are scared and save yourself the trouble when you get a divorce because you cheated and she'll take you to the drycleaners.<br>  Stupid man.|`|Bn59Yfomaa	when you take the vow if marriage you are giving everything to that person you shouldnt have gotten married if you arent ready to commit|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	You sound way to immature to be married. These are things you should have discussed and worked out BEFORE getting married.<br>  <br>  I feel bad for your wife.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	What are you, 12?<br>  <br>  When she is old you will be old too, so maybe she won't want to do it with your shrivled little pecker.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	Your libido will decrease with age as well. You could also have problems even getting it up. If you have to, masturbate!!|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Whip the Bishop.|`|pVbrHX0xaa	5 knuckle shuffle dude|`|XLsnuAqmaa	ugh, beat it, dude.|`|tkUCHhAdaa	When u lose something, you have to look for it..|`|DzAFT8VDaa	Mismatched libidos are not a justifiable reason to cheat - nothing is. Your wife should go to a doctor to find out if she has a chemical issue going on, or if there is something going on with her equipment. <br>  <br>  You have to hold true to your VOWS and your character no matter how strong your drive is to have sex. I see a lot of masturbation in your future, but you need to encourage your wife to seek help and be there with her every step of the way. Don't constantly ask for sex and don't do things for her with the goal of sex in mind. <br>  <br>  I think counseling and a trip to the gynecologist are in order first and foremost. Reassure her that you will not betray her and that you want to show her how much you love her in ALL the ways a man/wife are supposed to.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

AA10236380	Keep your guard up, move side-to-side, ducking and weaving - don't give them a clear target.  Stand sideways to your opponent to reduce your exposure to attack.  Be sure not to lock your knees or elbows or they'll be prime targets.<br>  <br>  Throw combinations: lead with jabs (helps gauge distance and distracts your opponent) then mix in straight punches, hooks and kicks...keep the kicks low and simple; less likely to lose your balance that way.  Combos of 2-3 moves is probably best.<br>  <br>  If your opponent is bigger, either stay out of their range or get in really close so they can't use those long arms effectively.  If smaller, use your reach to keep them far enough from being able to hit you.<br>  <br>  Remember to snap your punches and kicks out and back quickly; if you let them hang out there too long your opponent can grab them.<br>  <br>  Try to avoid getting into a grappling situation; you have the most options and control if you can stay on your feet.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if the opportunity presents itself, run like hell.<br>  <br>  Lastly, for future reference, don't go antagonizing people online.|`|Slr6jtMGaa	well, if you let him beat you, then the relationship will be ruined anyway....just tell your mom about the situation, she'll understand.....maybe she can talk to his mom about it and they can solve the problem....<br>  <br>  If that don't work, and he still want to beat you up, don't let him....defend yourself.....but let him be the one who hits you first, that way you can say that you were protecting yourself....don't be a sissy and just let him do that to you|`|4b67623de920c421c21d4a2a84b84023aa	hey better do this fast, tell your parents about your problem and see what they can do since that you said your mum and his mum are friends.

JhvqUvlsaa	Try to talk to your friends and ask them why they turned their back on you; ask them if there was anything you did that made them mad and offer to apologize. If they still refuse to speak to you I would wait and see if they come around. If not, then you need to work on yourself and the depression and maybe try to find some new friends.|`|yU2WHyvgaa	Same thing happened to me. All of my "best friends" started turning on me, talking about me behind my back, calling me abusive, and saying they hate me. I don't know why. The one girl calls me abusive. yeah she says that i'm abusive. This is coming from a person who beats me up everyday. And now i'm scared to talk to anyone because i've been abused by friends and i feel like everyone will hate me.<br>     What you should do is join a club. You will meet people with similar interests, and hopefully you'll find some good friends. Don't be afraid of rejection. Just think that the ones who are mean to you aren't nice people, and you will just have to accept that. There are nice people in this world and i hope you find some.|`|4ltupRctaa	you could do what your first answer said to do, it is a good idea if thats the angle you want to take, but personally that makes me kind of mad. If they where real friends they wouldnt of turned on you, especially while going through depression. thats when you need them the most. so i would just think **** em, make some new friends and show them you dont need them! <br>  <br>  good luck & dont give up!|`|ZJDpdp8Gaa	Hey. Look dude if they were your real friends they would have totally stayed with you. But they decided to turn there back on you. I can understand what you are going threw right now. So the best thing to do is talk to your friends and try to work the problem out. If they decide they do not want to talk or work it out then you should just try to forget and wait. Someday you will totally find a friend one day, and your friends that turned on you might even come back to work it out. But if they don't, then dont sweat it! Well I hope you can work things out and good luck!

3A9ZBk26aa	Is she an addict? If she is, thats probably why and you should convince her 2 go 2 rehab. <br>  You do know that since you're a minor, she has (by law) responsibility over you until you r 18?<br>  Tell a school conselor and he/she will set ur mom straight.<br>  The same thing happened 2 my bff.|`|AA11238703	you can leave and go to the police department and tell them what happened.  you can stay a few days with a friend and see if you can work something out.  you can try to renegotiate with your mom and talk to her - ask her if you can have a week or two to find some arranagements.  if you are in high school, you should go to your school counselor immediately and get connected with community resources.  maybe you can get in a foster care program or get emancipated.  if i were you i would try to get a job, you will need $$ soon.|`|1JBf1vRMaa	well this is a tricky question to answer but..<br>  i think you should confrunt her about her actions and get your point across..<br>  but no affence to your mom but a mother s supossed to love her children no matter what comes along...<br>  i think you should get out and hold your head high..<br>  lets face it you dont have to deal with anymore trouble..<br>  grab yourself some money..get a job..and get your self into a hotel untill you can buy yourself an appartment xx<br>  trust me ive had experience xx|`|0jeWHxKmaa	you should talk to her...if you dont want to do that then i think you should just leave.Ask one of your friends for a place to stay.|`|E1vyiNYKaa	try family|`|JIjuNh9Maa	go to the police|`|mzOQQ22Yaa	why ur mother just said that?<br>  in my county the girl can`t leave like this way<br>  she has to get married first<br>  <br>  i`m sorry to hear that
i4bjQbPcaa	They are disgusting horrible people.  Your boyfriend should either change his number or see the police about these malicious phone calls.<br>  <br>  As for your sisters husband giving out your numbers, I would go through him like nothing on earth.  He has obviously seen what your ex has put your through and still does this. If I was your sister I would have kicked him out<br>  <br>  Keep going to the police everytime he contacts you<br>  <br>  Edit:  I know the police don't take 'domestics' very seriously, its complete shite when they act like this.<br>  <br>  Is there a woman's refuge near you, you can get help and advice from them and also help your sister.<br>  <br>  Or you could just give an anon tip off when you know your ex and your sisters man are having a smoke and get them both arrested and then the pair of you can make your move
4IFXHz80aa	i would put him in my shirt pocket and make him spend a day with me. he would have to see how productive ive become and see the responsibilities i have. but the best part about it is hes going to have to see me with my husband and accept the fact that i will never be with him again, that i dont love him anymore, and that he screwed everything up between us and tossed me out.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Friend - "OMG! Your ex just shrunk down to 2 inches tall!!"  Me - "Who?"  :)|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I'd tell him to tell you not to ask this question. It's been asked a thousand times.|`|jPJ9MTCwaa	Same thing as I do now.  Ignore him.  He's not worth more notice than that.|`|prW1i0vzaa	I'd probably just giggle and walk away, hehe.|`|b9Hl0ITnaa	I would probably say what the hell?  I wouldn't do anything.  Maybe offer up one of my daughters Little People houses to him.
0QYIbn1saa	In men speak, this means "Hmm, i haven't even thought about valentines day.  what day is it again?  Crap, i should probably go buy something soon, huh".    My husband is the same way.  Men just don't think ahead and make plans like we do, that's all.  Go ahead and get a babysitter and make it an unforgettable night.  Next year he'll be asking you that question ;p    GROW UP NINA!  LMAO, people are lame.|`|AA12066682	He doesn't care less.  Most men and many women feel that Valentine's Day is just another excuse to have to spend money on stuff that you don't need.  Maybe he just wants to spend time with the whole family since Valentine's Day is about being with the ones you love.|`|auNUWQo7aa	Most men don't care to understand Valentine's Day and just try to remember to be thoughtful so that they don't get in trouble.    Look at the bright side, at least he didn't completely forget and already make other plans or something. After all, he is giving YOU the option, 'if you want to.' LOL.    Maybe next time state: "I'm going to ask my parents to babysit on Valentine's Day."  That way he can't get stuck in a bad answer.    I mean, why did you ask him what he wanted if you were expecting a certain answer anyways?|`|eF6HTt0gaa	I gave up asking my husband if he wants to do anything for that holiday cause when ever we planned something in the past it always got janked around or the sitter cancled. So now we do something at home with the kids and we put them to bed early and do something more adult" wiggles the eye brows and gives that Wicked evil grin" down stairs where we can just about be as loud as we want and not wake them up.      But for you going out once every 2 weeks just might be the thing you need, if you still have them around go to a drive in movie and  start making out like a couple of teenagers. Or just go out to dinner and catch up on the adult side of your lives you havnt been able to with the kids around. Thats what we do. Sure it hasnt happened since December but its helped. And we where at the point of barely speaking around thanksgiving about anything other then the kids. Trust me go out on a date, and keep a date night twice a month and go from there. Hugs hun|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	It means, if you want to, then have your parents babysit. If you don't want to, it's fine too. Sounds like he's just as happy spending an evening at home with the kids - what's wrong with that?    P.S. Well, then tell him, "I want to" and make plans. Whether or not his reply is an indication of him not giving a sh1t about you or if it's just a reflection of his personality (submissive, for example) or his schedule (he's tired) is really something only you can determine based on his general pattern of behavior. Perhaps he's looking for you to make the decision, and he will be happy to go along. It's not the same as not caring at all. Don't overthink, just go with the flow. Good luck.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Seriously, most men do not give a crap about Valentine's Day and the ONLY reason most of them go out and buy flowers and all the other crap is because they don't want to be vilified and harassed about NOT doing so for the next 12 months!|`|EdidZdtlaa	ummmm sorry to say but yea it usually does.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	No. That means whatever you think is right, honey.|`|UgcPxd4maa	that means he really didn't have anything planned - so ask your parents to watch the kids, and let him know that they will be doing so. Maybe he'll get off his butt and plan something for the 2 of you. Or you can plan something as well....|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My husband always tells me if you want to. I asked him about it once and he said that he wants what I want. But, he's really laid back and would tell me if the answer was no. So, when he says if you want to I take it as a yes.|`|pErRGYH7aa	Grow up.  It means that if you'd like to do something on Valentine's Day, make plans and stop expecting him to read your mind.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	No it means, he couldn't care less.|`|kej0H1AXaa	It means you're shallow for wanting to separate the family over a dumb "holiday"|`|hp1dbME4aa	yes, that's the assumption I would take...I'm sorry.|`|TzeYsXKGaa	No man really cares about Valentines much. If they plan or buy something for the day they do it for us, not for them!|`|Ne7xr36Saa	it probably means that he could care less about doing anything. Maybe he would just like to stay home and "celebrate" with his "family"...   and, why are you coming down on Rosie. You asked, she gave her answer...and why did you use the"this catagory" to make a point of being a pain in the butt?  We aren't all just here for your entertainment you know. Most of us take is somewhat seriously.|`|AA11481889	I asked my husband the same thing...and got the same response...lol.    Frankly...it's more symbolic for me, because logically I know it's just a Hallmark Holiday and I'll be paying a 20% mark up on everything and facing a mad crowd for crappy service....when I could go a week later and have a better time....but it's valentine's day...    So on the one hand...I have the sappy desire to succumb to the hype...and on the other...I have the defiant need to ignore that it's even coming...and now out of spite for hubby's response, I feel like making reservations somewhere horrendously overpriced...    I don't know what the hell I'm going to do...lol.     ****************    As a side note..."spending time without the kids" doesn't necessarily mean going out...it could just be as simple as 5AM on the hood of the car in the garage....lol...you gotta get creative when your time is limited.|`|IamzZ1IXaa	men don't make a big deal about valentines day    plus if he always does nice things for you, then that should just be another day to him
a14b96b25b5bf9293d533f13874f2a6aaa	We got great flowergirl dresses on Ebay for less than $20. Brand new, with stickers. They have lots and lots to choose from. Just do the search on ebay and you will be amazed how many they have. We were so thrilled with our purchases that we ordered more for a second wedding they were in. They were 3 years old for the first wedding and 7 for the second. (They are twin girls so I totally understand how expensive it can be to outfit 2 for a wedding!)<br>  I don't know about the dress blues but we got a little tux for next to nothing on ebay. <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|rebWUfLzaa	Do you have a Ross in your area?  Name brand discontinued/out of season and a great discount.  <br>  I get a lot of clothes, shoes, and household items there.

They could serve very nicely as a flower girl dress.|`|ivhnVbbraa	Do you have a Burlington coat factory? That's were I got my flower girl dresses. And they were $30. Still not that bad.

4iXO8APhaa	Oh my God!  Did you even read your question back to yourself?  It is glaring how many signs of an abusive man you are ignoring!      1-  He HITS WOMEN!!!    2- History of trouble= criminal record waiting to happen, if not already established: punching someone in the face is ASSAULT, and it's a fellony!    3- You don't want to choose between your FRIENDS and a VIOLENT, MYSOGYNIST WITH ANGER ISSUES AND NO SELF-CONTROL?!! WOW, how insulting for your friends!!!    4- He is really protective of you?  That gave me the chills.  That means he wants to be the only person in your life, he wants to get rid of anyone in your circle who might disagree with his tactics, so that he can better control you!!!    5- You say you've just begun the relationship, good!  Then it won't be hard to END IT!  Do it now, before he gets his hooks in you and the break-up becomes dangerous for you AND your friends!    WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T KID YOURSELF, THIS BOY IS A TIME-BOMB AND IT IS NOT YOUR JOB TO DISARM HIM, LEAVE THAT TO THE PROFESSIONALS (psychiatrists, psychologists...)  IF IN DOUBT ABOUT ANYTHING I"VE SAID, REFER TO POINT  1  HE HITS WOMEN!!!!!  That should have been the end of the relationship right there!  Be strong and thank God for your friends, they are clearly better judges of character than you are!  I am still in shock and awe that you feel there is a CHOICE to be made between your FRIENDS who are watching out for you and obviously care about your well-being and happiness and this DOUCHEBAG FREAK WHO GOES AROUND HITTING PEOPLE and making you afraid of making him mad (your 5th paragraph).    A real relationship is one where if you need to tell your mate something that might upset them, but it is necessary to talk about, you do it and if he gets mad, he'll get over it and you don't have to fear him taking it out on you (verbally OR physically) or on one of your friends!  If I were the friend that he hit and saw that you didn't immediately break up with him after he hit me, I would cease being your friend!  THINK!  Is any of this "hitting" a nerve?|`|lHzBJA4eaa	C'mon, are we supposed to believe you are that dumb? One day you'll be saying that you didn't know he was going to beat you and asking people to help you and feel sorry for you.|`|nl7tkxc3aa	(lmfaoo]    why do I find this funny ? ..    Yeh, get rid of him.    Friends are for life ; yah digg ?|`|SKqTyJD6aa	well if your friends don't like him...they may just be saying that to get you guys broken up...its a possibility...so make SURE you know that he actually hit her...did you see him do this?|`|SNaxiArHaa	Did he confirm hitting her. They could just be making it up so that you would dump him seeing as they already don't like him|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	I would talk to your friend that got hit about it and ask what the situation was, then I would tell your boyfriend that he needs to apologize to her.  If he can't try to get along with your friends then he isn't worth it because this will most likely cause slight problems with your friends and no guy is worth that.|`|hMZQd7Cpaa	Dump him ASAP;  Like forreal if he did that to her big chance hes gonna  nd up doing it to you!|`|600367b3135824b97a54e03105e6a6feaa	that's not good. you never want a violent boyfriend. i would reconsider your relationship. remember friends are ALWAYS first!|`|zhk8o514aa	Why did he hit her for?  I think it's not right at all but what happened? We don't have the full story here.|`|zuFJmLhgaa	Dump him, it will be you he hits next..    He should have never laid a hand on a female..|`|t4F59gf2aa	waahaa so dump him or have a nice picture ready for the Amber alert.  Soliciting strangers for sympathy is a really useful thing to do.|`|KgTTX2Nyaa	well if you and CB have been together not that long, its never to late to end anything before it gets more serious. cause im pretty sure you and your friend are closer  OR  just tell him striaght out like , what u did is super wrong and im not going to tolerate any of this b.s so tell me you wont do it again and change that or we cant be together anymore    hope that helpedd|`|sdt7vPSoaa	Actually his outburst could be something good in a mental way. Your friend could have said something very mean about you or relationship with him. Forgive him but don't break up with him. He deserves another chance and plus he sounds like a pretty good guy with some things you can help him with!|`|v2D4Sao5aa	honey get ride of him wat are you going to pick your bf over your best friend just dont trust me dump his *** all the way or else your bot going to have no frieends ok so dump his *** plz just do it !!!!|`|r1hnI0Tzaa	hmmmm..... intresting first thing you should do is consult your boyfriend ask him why he did that. If things run smoothly there then make him apologize. Tell your friend why he did that and work out a forgivement. If you still happen to be guilty and shakey about it after all this i suggest breaking up with him or forcing him to change his ways. If you see no progress break up with him. Be with the man you are sure true to your heart with good luck!|`|z2OfsA0Jaa	your so gullible|`|IHwMbLX5aa	I would ditch him asap. It could be you getting slapped next. He sounds like he has the potential to be abusive!|`|xreWOKBYaa	You are ******* ***** to even consider dating a guy who hit your friend. How dare you choose an abusive man over your friend you *****! No apology will take bakc what he did to your friend. Dump him and report him to the police for assalt.|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	dump him|`|AA12212403	I think it's best to find another boyfriend, personally.  If you were older, I'd suggest counselling but this guy needs to learn that you just don't do stuff like that.|`|XB8ErFGdaa	Dump the s**t outta him.  Because friend's always go first!|`|ITfBQzg6aa	Y did he hit her?|`|4RiziMD0aa	ask your friend why he hit her, maybe he was agitated and did it. it is however no excuse to hit a girl no matter what. he too early to know if he's abusiv but your seeing little signs already, take care and watch out. i'd take pre-caution, this is serious do you really want to be with a guy who hit someone?|`|1bd6bed96945902efbb41e9de84dbcd3aa	I always believed that friends were MORE important than men and that I will ALWAYS take their sides in situations. Anytime my man has ever disrespected my friends or family, it is ova!|`|bm1rsts7aa	Ask him if he hit her and if he says he did, break up with him. Right there. That's never ever okay.    If he says he didn't, decide who you would believe. I vote your friends. Why would they lie?     It seems like you think he did it. I can't believe you're considering staying with him or apologizing for him. If I was your friend, I would break up with you.|`|KcvinDvgaa	Honey, your friends are more important. Boyfriends come and go, and you haven't been with him long enough to know alot about him; his true nature if you will. And since he has hit someone before, whats to stop him from hitting others? Don't loose your friends over some guy who you're not really sure about.|`|qZPZ2bTpaa	I know you don't want to hear it, but you need to break up with him.  If he is not respecting your friends, it is almost as if he is not respecting you.  Unless you think that a guy is more important that your friends, you need to break up with him.|`|gfxXikenaa	he is of violent nature but doesnt necessarily mean he's bad|`|DIwflbskaa	"CB has never, ever, hurt me before at all"  Lol, that doesn't mean that he won't hurt you in the future.

Your friend came to you so you can do something and you don't know what to do. Either decision will hurt someone. So I will not tell you what to do or give you my opinion i will give you three options maybe that will help.   OPTION A.) You break up with your boyfriend since it's nothing serious and that helps your friend  OPTION B.) You tell your friend it's no big deal and stay with your bf even though he may break up with you later....  OPTION C.) You find out the whole story and then make your choice.|`|sHm4ISMJaa	hes a ******* dick head.  if he is gonna abuse your best friend like that, hes sooo not worth it.  get rid of the douche.|`|4Ito7TPMaa	It's only a matter of time before he hits you.|`|G6dVr7bBaa	ask ur boyfriend why he hit her, and let him know that it isn't okay to do things like that.

Why be his boyfriend? And just ask him why he hit your friend. Talk to him.|`|4Rh1qQAoaa	If you are not that close to CB but you are to AR, i think you owe it to your friends to leave CB and find a boyfriend that respects your friends as well as you.

No male should EVER put their hands on a female in a harmful way. He hasn't hurt you yet, but I have no doubt that he will if you stick around. Only a coward would hit a female.|`|R6lxaKiEaa	Girl!  Run while you can!!  Sounds like your man got issues if he is hitting on a  girl at all.  Its just a matter of time before he starts hitting on you, and God forbid anything else..

Your friend just got pussy slapped by your boyfriend, the LEAST you could do for your friend right now is apologize. Who cares if apologizing makes him mad? Aren't you furious that your boyfriend just hit your friend? This is so weird.    anyways, him being of protective of you isn't good, just so you know. If he's over protective of you then that means that he could eventually become abusive. I'd break up with him and mature a little bit before you date anyone else. This is the stupidest relationship I've ever heard of in my entire life.|`|ys2iSL3kaa	girl, leave his sorry ***...if he's hit your friend, he will undoubtedly hit you...its just a matter of when...friends will always be there (for the most part) boyfriends come and go, you will one day find a good guy...|`|n05KVINnaa	yeah..get him dumped..is he called wayne kerr?? sounds like he could be called that..|`|TpcrI3rKaa	u need to find out why he hit her but let me remind all the females out there if he hit a girl he will hit again////////|`|1c674c32f70abbba9b74d0e568421553aa	1.Why did he hit your friend, did you witness it, who did?  these things are important in verifying the validity. It could be your idiot friends trying to make things up and break you up.    2. Hitting a girl in any manner is unacceptable!    I've been lots of fights but i've never touched a woman in anger. Physically harming a woman is unnaceptable and those that do are not real men and have problems.|`|4XD26uLhaa	well first u need to talk to him and tell not to mess with your friends. and if he does it again i think u should dump him. because if u haven't heard Friends are Forever and Boys are whatever|`|T3GJlhQAaa	Too much drama Too soon..... Leave him.|`|ayiCDGhNaa	your boyfriend sounds like a real jerk off. friends are forever get rid of that loser. it's only been 2-3 weeks, cut your loses. he is nothing but trouble, nd if he hit your friend-he's letting you know it|`|FU5z9yWuaa	i dnt really no wat to tell u coz its a tough decision but have u ever tried to discuss it with him like even if u ain't serious hes still somehow ur "boyfriend" ask him if it has hit that friend since u said ur friends dnt like him maybe their making it up and if he says no try and find out before u take any action and then if he has that's when u can decide but i say u still apologize coz he cant expect u not to get mad if he hits ur friend whilst u think he will get mad if u APOLOGIZE to ur friend ..hope it helped|`|AuWPMH44aa	First you should ask him if he did actually hit her. If u say ur friends dnt like him they culd be lying so u dump him. You never know. second if he did do that shyt then get rid of the guy cuz like every1 else said it could easily happen to you if he hit another girl.|`|8CI9rDXhaa	If i was you i would talk to him and if that does not do anything then i would give him one more chance but just tell him you don't want to be with someone that will hurt your friends just let him no. But if nothing changes then i would dump him|`|0lg8v8dgaa	I would be wary of your boyfriend. He could turn out to be abusive. On the contrary, he could have hit your friend for a reason. Did she say something that may have insulted him, or you, in any way? I've known guys who pretend to be nice, but then once they have you, they turn out to be total bastards. Ask him why he hit your friend. Then ask your friend why she think she hit her. Get both sides of the story. I would tell your boyfriend that if he really wants to be with you, he'll have to respect your friends. He can play rough with his friends and show off all he wants, but he can't just go around hitting girls. He could, however, have ADHD. That stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. My uncle and my cousin have ADHD and they both tend to get angered easily, lash out, and are extremely hyper. If he does have ADHD, that is something you will just have to except.    Anyways, I would just ask for both sides of the situation and then try to draw a conclusion from that. I hope I was of some assistance! :)|`|miyAb7cQaa	Get the facts before you make your decision but let me tell you one thing where I come from guys that hit girls don't make that sort of thing public.(most guys that I kick it with would kick the !@ $ out of a guy that likes to hit girls).|`|y43tzOQlaa	He's a show off, with tempers like that he'll become jealous and possessive of you and you could be next. He may not seem like he could ever hurt you, he's protective of you and only acts like a jerk when someone pushes his buttons or pisses him off, or god forbid tells him what a jerk he is. Sound familiar? Run the other way.
VMY7No0eaa	i WOULD WRITE OUT A CONTRACT.  Both sign it.   if her grades go down or any other reason to be grounded etc. she looses the car privileges immediately!|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Yes, because of your promise.  The matter of insurance, tags, maintenance, and rules of driving still have to be worked out.  She is high risk for very good reason.  You don't want her to become a statistic and 15 years has not prepared her for all the consequential that come with car ownership like peer pressure.  You just increased your problems.|`|vQmO3N6Raa	Let Her get one on her birthday, she'd be really happy then. =]    she'd be a very lucky girl to have a nice car at 15. cool mom too =D|`|9TvkpDVxaa	sure and if she doesnt like what she gets then she will learn her lesson|`|O3U7aLCDaa	Absolutely.  But DON"T let her have the keys until she gets her drivers license. If she wants a car then let her buy one.  It's her money and if she worked that hard for it then she deserves to buy a car.  And it will make her happy so let her!  Plus you won't have to worry about her damaging your car!|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	I think she's not experienced enough and you'll be sorry.  I think a year's supervision in driving with a permit will save you a lot of heartache|`|vupWa0eXaa	Well, if your 5 year old saved up enough money to get a gun, would you let him?    i know thats kind of a lame example, but serisouly, 15 is wayyy to young.

If she spends her own money, it will show her how to handle her own money and if she will be extra careful when she drives if she has bought the car and has to pay for any repairs! A car will teach responsibility! I would say go for it!|`|AA11646252	She can not drive on her own until 16 right?  So you would have to be on the insurance and titled in your name.  If you are ok with that then get it.  It would be best if she waited a little and you figure out what is the best way to do insurance and title and such.  If you make her do most of this it would take a little more time but just remember it is not good to let a car sit to long.  So drive it every now and then but do not fill it up if not driving all the time so gas does not get old.    rd|`|MG1IVmvIaa	Ask yourself am I willing to let go of my 15 year old, because that will  be what you will be doing.  no matter how much you say she knows the rules. the rules will be broken(no perfect kids) When they get a car they become in their minds an adult and they will start making decisions with a childs mind.  don't let her get it, she will only be a child once.At 18 she'll be ready to get a job and pay for a car...Be a parent not her friend.|`|32uGH3cVaa	not a 15 year old.  after shes passed her test and has her permit then yes.  that all happens when your 16  wait until she's 16.  if shes paying for it though you should let her.
AA10766729	Whoooopsie...you've slipped off the family wagon and have started treading down the long and dangerous road of unhealthy obsession!    Your brother's partner choice IS NOT your business.    HE is the one who will have to live with her, not you.  If you don't want her in your house, THAT is your business.    But you have absolutely NO place in telling him who he is to marry.  You do NOT have the right to dictate to your brother who he shall or shall not spend the rest of his life with.    He is a PART of your life and you are PART of his; it is NOT all-inclusive and all-encompassing when you two become adults.        You, I think, would benefit from some counseling so you can learn healthy and beneficial limits and boundaries.      If your brother found out what you were planning, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if he excluded you entirely from his wedding plans!!    You sound more like a jealous ex-girlfriend than his loving sister!    You need to grow up....you sound like you're about 12.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	It sounds like you're a bit younger than your brother.  Your feelings are valid, but it is his choice whom he will marry.    the speak now part is from way back when... it's for a legal objection.  I think if you disrupt his wedding you'll hurt him more than you'll feel better.  Did you see 28 dresses (or whatever that bridesmaid move was) where she ruined her siste's wedding/party with her slideshow and how she felt afterward?  YEAH - he'd be humiliated and may not be so forgiving.  You really wouldn't feel better.     If marrying her is a mistake, it needs to come from wihtin him not his overprotective sister. You don't have to take her in as your sister-in-law, but you do have to be respectful to her an adult.     You're not "stupid" for wanting to interrupt - weddings are emotional good and bad; it is, however immature to interrupt.  You love your brother and don't want to see him get hurt, but sometimes adults know things teens dont.  I felt the same way when my sister got married. I liked the guy but he was 'taking her away' from me.  I'm sure my brother felt the same way when I got married.  I know when he remarried, and I performed their ceremony  - and it included his kids which I helped him raise for 4 years, I was jealous of his new wife - she got "my" girls, especially the little one.       Just try to be civilized, and try to be happy for HIM that he found someone that makes him happy - you don't have to be happy for her.  Your feelings toward her may change, and they may not.  Either way the mature thing to do is to let nature take its course.  If you can't be civilized, then stay home from the wedding.    Best of luck to you|`|t1WOxnI8aa	You need to let it go because it's not going to cause anyone else grief except for you.|`|YSmYkc5Yaa	Everybody that has answered is right. It's not your business at all.    Look at it this way.    What happens if you find a guy you absolutely love, and he asks you to marry him and you guys are going to get married...    But your brother hates his guts and threatens to ruin your wedding and says he's not going to accept him etc.    What would YOU do? Would you leave the man you love because your brother doesn't like him? I highly highly doubt it.     Your brother may love you because your his sister yes, but he's in love with his soon to be wife, who he has to live with and be with for the rest of his life. She's now a very important part of his life, and you have to deal with that.    You're acting highly immature about this and seriously need to grow up. You're stupid for wanting to interrupt his wedding, because it's their special day. It's the day they've been waiting for. To be able to be married and then spend the rest of their lives together. You don't mess that up you spoiled little girl.|`|ziZQWxi3aa	Sounds like you have the little sister syndrome, as I have had it and I still sometimes do feel it!  I'm 27 by the way.  My brother is in his very 1st real relationship because they  moved in together and I sometimes get jealous, because I don't see him as often as I use to, he moved like 2 and a half hours away.  But I realize that he loves her and I like her because I got to know her.     It is his life not yours, wouldn't you be mad if your parents were saying don't marry the person you are in love with?  Would anger you, ya know?  So if you love your brother than you will respect his choices!|`|55zWUXcUaa	You can say what ever you choose no one can stop you, but it would be completely self serving and rude.  Also just the same right you have to say what you choose then he has the right to reject what you say because he can think for himself and his then wife would have every right to dislike you and they would probably drift away from you.  You say you love your brother so much then you would want him to be happy.  Let him be happy if he loves this girl let him marry her without causing a fuss.|`|tyl9aSu9aa	Yes.    This is stupid and self-centered, and, frankly, the more you talk about how you don't like her the more you push the two of them together, which is the opposite of what you want.    She's going to be his family now, too, and your's, so tighten your lips, get a hobby, and get over yourself.    Geez.|`|N6RvvfHfaa	well for 1 its ur brothers wedding  2: wat makes her so bad  3: if your brother loves her enough to maryy her then just froget about it  4: if you dont like her you can ignore her  5: people think its bad to interrupt the wedding casue there is a consequence that consequence is you brother could end up hating u for what you say at his wedding  6: if u love ur brother and want him to be happy let him learn the hard way if shes a bad cookie yea well he gona have to learn sooner or later yea ur family but hey if u love them let go but no to far|`|qW3dVcRtaa	Because it is your brothers life not yours.... Why do you care who he marries, just because she becomes your SIL doesnt mean you have to communicate with her.    I know one thing, you stand up and say something and he is going to hate you for it... On top of that you will look like a total Tool.... Because no one does that anymore...    Sounds like you have some growing up to do.    I did not like my sisters husband when she married him, and all i did was told her that i could not attend because i did not agree, she respected my decision, however it is her life and she chose to marry him, that is her buisness.....  My mother has been married three times, and for the two i was here for, both times i told her i didnt agree with what she was doing, but again it is her life and she has to make her own decisions, all i can do is voice my opinion, and that is it.|`|819ad8842ebdf96b383c9430aef4be6eaa	I'm sure you are really frustrated that you think he's making the wrong move.  Maybe someday you can tell him "I told you so!"  Watch the movie About Schmidt.  His daughter is going to marry a man he detests, and faces the same type of frustration you do.    He's your brother, you didn't raise him and you are not responsible for his mistakes.  If his wedding is already planned, there is not much you can do.  If it were you, and your brother hated your choice and was going to mess up your wedding because he didn't like his new brother-in-law, how would you feel?  So, try to be supportive, even if it is not easy.  You'd want him to do the same for you.  Invite a friend and have a good time at the wedding.  Just think, it probably could be worse.|`|itbkP9HGaa	discuss with your brother ahead of time why you don't want him to marry this woman.  Then during his wedding, keep silence or don't attend.    You are not going to be more important than this woman after he marries her.  Then, she'll be his wife and she'll get top billing.  Get used to it.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	Why does everybody think I'm stupid for wanting to interrupt his wedding?    How selfish and rude. He has found someone he adores and wants to spend the rest of his life with. Because you are jealous, bitter and spiteful you would ruin that?? What exactly has she done to you to make you hate her?  You sound like you are in 3rd grade. Grow up.|`|7lmtBhdMaa	I don't think you're stupid, but I do think that you're very young and naive. You may be related, but that does not make you his sole owner. His life is his to live, not yours. Get your own life and grow up.|`|cGtHHDg5aa	Are you willing to risk losing your relationship with your brother for the rest of your life?  If you aren't, than you should hold your tongue.    Who your brother marries is not up to you.  He will marry the one that makes him happy - the one he is willing to give forever to.  Your blessing is not required.    It makes sense that you want to be heard, but I fear in the end you will still end up with a sister-in-law you don't approve of, a brother who has lost respect for you and a very astonished family.    Speak to him privately if you must, but I would advise you to let it go.|`|Q8XhdOPkaa	Who your brother decides to marry is none of your business. Yes, she will be your sister in law, but grow up a little and accept the fact that he is marrying the person who he loves. He doesn't need your approval. You are stupid for interrupting his wedding. Look at it this way. How would YOU feel about it if it WAS you and your brother interrupted your wedding cause he hated your soon to be husband? Come on, grow up a little. Why do you hate her so much? Could it be that you never "approved" of her? Your brother does not need your approval at all. He's a grown man. He can do whatever he wants and pleases. If this marriage causes you to not talk to him anymore, then it's your problem. If I was him, I'd be a little relieved. Why are you telling him what he can and cannot do? You're just a little obsessed and it's time to focus on something else.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	First of all, the "speak now or forever hold your peace" thing has to do with anyone having a LAWFUL reason why the couple can't be married (such as one already being married, one or both being underage), not because some twit in the audience doesn't approve.  You don't get to pick your siblings' spouses.  They do.  That's the end of it.  Get over yourself.|`|oq29JFRfaa	if he really does love her then it's not your decision.  it's his love life and not yours.  who knows, he might get you back at your wedding.  don't do anything you'll regret|`|rtIS8mdtaa	that is because you are not in charge of your brothers life. You cant tell him whom to love or whom not to! Respect his decisions. If you want to talk to him, i think you should but if he doesn't change his mind, you just have to respect that decision.|`|agTCqkLDaa	If you loved him as much as you say you do, you'd talk to him BEFORE the wedding and not be a brat during the wedding.    If you talk to him and he still carries on with his decision just grow up and deal with it.    Gosh, you must have an easy life is this is your biggest concern.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Simple question:  do you do every single thing your brother or your parents to do?  By your logic, it is their business and you should do exactly what they tell you to do.    If your dislike of her is that she is annoying, then suck it up and say nothing unless you want to lose the relationship that you currently have with your brother.      The reason why the pastor asks if anyone knows of a reason why the two should not be married is for things like that the person is still married to someone else or that the bride or groom is getting married under threat of physical harm.  The fact that the groom's sister doesn't like her future SIL is not sufficient reason to disrupt the ceremony.    Otherwise, then your brother has to learn from his own mistakes.  Oh, and karma is a PITA.  If you ruin  your brother's wedding, you should expect your own fairytale wedding to also be disrupted by ugliness.|`|AA11603468	If you did that to me at my wedding, I would not forgive that. If you object to his marrying his gf, you say something privately well beforehand, allow him to consider what you've said and make his own decisions from there. I suspect he will still marry her, and you will lost alot of his respect. You say you're family, but I will tell you, he thinks of her as his family, and he most probably puts her above anyone else--and that includes you. You don't have to like her, but unless you really hate your brother, don't ruin his wedding day like that.     I don't know how old you are, but you sound like you cannot be any older than 12 or so. I doubt you understand the seriousness of what you are proposing.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Just because you don't like her is no reason for your brother not to marry the woman he loves. He is going to choose her over you. Sorry. Why should he put off his life of getting married and having children and starting his OWN life just because you "don't like her." If you loved your brother you would just be happy for him. And every one is right, it is none of your business. What if you fell in love and your brother didn't like the guy you wanted to marry? And what if he stood up at your wedding and displayed his dislikes, ruining your wedding? You are not the one that is right here. If you can't go to the wedding and be a big girl and keep your thoughts to yourself, maybe you shouldn't go.|`|AA11138696	He is your brother not your child.  You have no claim on his life and he has no responsibility to follow your instructions.  Who he loves IS none of your business as in it has nothing to do with you.  He will still be your brother regardless of who he loves.  If you loved him you would not even think of making him chose.  I hope he choses his future wife and leaves you by the curb until you learn to grow up.
764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I wouldn't consider myself to be a feminist. I applaud stay at home moms- let me be most specific- I applaud families where one of the parents sacrifice delaying the advancement of the career for the sake of ensuring that the children will have a good foundation. In our family, my husband does that. He's a SAHD. I chose to continue working because its cheaper to get excellent health insurance and life insurance for us all, through my employer. Not to mention, we're involved in other programs such as medical care pre-tax set- asides and full tuition reimbursement, through my employer.     I don't have a degree. I was in school pursuing a degree but we had a baby the week before fall registration, so while I am a student I'm not currently taking classes right now. My husband has a degree in Computer Science. His degree is not being put to use and him not having an income is difficult on him mentally. However, he LOVES being home with our daughter. I find myself getting jealous sometimes but the fact is, somebody has to make the sacrifice and our sacrifices are different. He sacrificed a personal income and I sacrificed spending every day with our daughter. My point is, men- if they want- are just as capable of caring for babies and children as mothers. True, they don't nurse but the milk can be pumped. So, there is nothing that prevents a guy from being the one who stays home with the children. I think some guys choose not to.     Now, housewives are a different story. I don't agree with women who spend their days cooking and cleaning. I believe that all adults who are able to work, should. All adults who are capable of cleaning, should. And the only ones who are exempt are children. I don't think a woman should be cleaning up behind her husband like his mother nor should a husband be supporting his wife like he's her father. When you take children out of the picture and the wife decides not to work, to take care of her house, she's eliminating somebody else's responsibility. That's how I am and how I live and my reasons for living this way. I'm not judging anybody else. Being a housewife wouldn't be a suitable lifestyle for me.|`|UgcPxd4maa	I think its always better for one parent to stay home with the kids - preferably the mother for the first couple years, and then the dad is fine as well.|`|zhk8o514aa	I say if they want to...go ahead and stay home.  Your life can completely change as soon as you have a kid.      You may have your whole life planned out, but at the end...human nature will tend to win.|`|VrjF986Aaa	I think it's their choice to live the life they want to. Luckily now women have the option of being able to have careers, but that doesn't mean that no women should ever be house wives. I don't think it's more important for a woman or a man to be the stay at home spouse, as long as the other person can financially support the family on their own. I think fathers and mothers both have important roles in a child's life.|`|vwuMTm7Saa	Using your skills at home and choosing to stay with your children is a whole feminist movement in and of itself.  It is a way of taking claim to an intuitive part of being a woman...I love it.

It's not like we live in the early '70's.  The die's been cast and most of us women don't really have a choice to stay home, beyond the first couple of years of our children's lives.  And this is just the facts.    But when it comes to divorce, I think SAHM's fare the worst these days.  The courts don't give out alimony the way they used to and moms are EXPECTED to work.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Feminists what do you think of stay at home moms?    They hate them. I mean HATE. They see them as willing slaves to the alter of misogynistic abuse.     ESP. Women who have their degrees but choose not to use them?    Personally, I don't understand why, but it's true. They hold this even further against housewives. I suppose the idea is, if you're not college educated, you're to be pitied. But if you've recieved your education, that means your refusal of the feminist philosophy was an intellectual CHOICE. And that makes you a traitor to feminists.    And is it more important that a women stay home as oppose to a man?    Because men and women are different. A 50/50 marriage isn't two halves of the same pie. It's much more like a plug and socket. Both are radically different in design and function, but both are needed to create a circut.    Of course, feminism has rejected the necessity of men on every level. So I can't imagine them understanding this rather simple concept.    At the end of the day, it comes down to what people care about. I know men who are fastidiously clean. But they're atypical. I know women who think making a pile of stuff is getting 90% of the room clean, but they're not normal.    Women take care of the home because that is their priority. They WANT clean floors and dusting every bookshelf, and they CARE about how the laundry is folded and where the food is kept.    Men take care of outside chores because they WANT their house to look good, their cars to run well, and their power tools to be sharp. They CARE about building new decks so the family can BBQ, cleaning the garage so that they can exit their vehicles easily, and putting up Christmas lights so people can enjoy them.    These are all just typical examples, but they illustrate the point: Men and Women gravitate to career and homelife due to intrisic preference.    And is it saying men aren't as important in the kids life?    No, thats what the feminists claim. That is reflected in their politics. But men and women bring different things to the marriage, perform different duties, and have different roles to the children.     Fathers bring stability, strength, authority, justice, and safety to a home. They are final arbiters, disciplinarians, craftsmen, and defenders.     Mothers bring compassion, warmth, emotional health, unity, utility, and love into a home. They are the drill sargents, organizers, supporters, medics, counselors, and keepers of tradition.     With just a mom...you have anarchy and vulnerabilty  With just a dad....you have inefficency and impersonality.     It just doesn't work.|`|a94257e28d6b37ec0048499a1cda4a58aa	I have respect for stay at home moms & dads.|`|FJ6960c8aa	i love desperate housewives!!!    i was installing cable for a woman... she locked the door on me and seduce me!    ...|`|023e4a8fafa700085b1d1986f48cf326aa	Its a personal choice, no man worth being with makes a woman stay at home all day...thats what day care is for    although i do think it is important for either the man or woman to stay home with their children during the day but women shouldn't give up their jobs to do so|`|xreWOKBYaa	I am a feminist and I am also a stay at home mom with no degree. I believe being a feminist is about having the choice to do everything a man has the choice to do. I have all the thing available to be that my husband does, but I CHOOSE to be a stay at home mom because that is what brings me the most joy out of life.    My husband is very into our childrens lives, you don't have to be with your  kids 24/7 to be close to them. He works to help our family but I stay home to help our family too.    EDIT: Growing up in a house with a powermom and a power dad (always at work) our house was always messy and me and my sibilings had to time with our parents. So, even though most of my children are in school now - I will remain a stay at home mom. To take care of home things while I have to time to during the day. I take care of the bills, the credit cards, the kids to school, lacross, girl scouts, boy scouts and everything else my children get into! =] While also keeping a clean house, and a Full and Happy family and Husband!    I believe women should have equal rights and free will, and I'm using my free will to do what makes me happiest... being a mommy!

Equality works both ways.   Whoever is 'better' with the children would be the proper choice for the stay home parent.

Although, it's a disgraceful waste of a degree.      My mother worked odd shifts to be home with us. When I was real little she worked night shift and was home during the day (although sleeping, she was still there), and dad was home at night. Later she worked evenings, and my dad worked nights. So they both had jobs, but there was always someone at home with us, at least while we were awake.   Noone NEEDS to sacrifice a family for a career, or a career for a family. There are always ways to compromise.           I think it would be nice to stay at home all day though. Send the kiddies to school, and get all the housework done really early, then go out all day. It's not like you'd have to be home to cook dinner, you can just get it out of a box these days. I'd say you could get in a good 5 hours of doing whatever you want before the kids get home.   Maybe.      I'd rather use the degree i'm paying for and earning right now, and go be an anthropologist, studying aboriginal people somewhere though.|`|AA11990465	I think its best if at least one of the parents stay home with a child until they are at least school age, although I think it should be the mother more so than the father. Of course the father is important in a child's life, but in the early years of a childs life, I think that the mother needs to be there for the nurturing and care giving, especially if she breastfeeds.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Yeah, I have several degrees and I say to you that your phraseology of this question is an embrassment to all women...women who USE their degrees in life in general, WHETHER at home or professional work!    I've stayed home for a time but worked for some years, mostly by necessity.  It is no longer ABOUT whether it's "more important" to "stay home" - it's about being in a marriage where the two of you decide what's best and how you're going to work it out - and that can EASILY mean, a man opting to work from home or stay home for a period, or a woman.    I think your questions posed are incredibly sexist and silly...Hey, is anyone home there?  This is the milinneum - we ALREADY have couples opting to do both, they are ALREADY working this out couple by couple - "one size" does not "fit" all...we make our own rules babe, where ya been?    Sincerely,    Grace|`|jOM4bBMPaa	I think someone needs to be at home with the kids, but it doesn't need to be the woman.  If a woman has a better paying, secure job that she's happy with why not have the man stay home?  I don't see much of a difference between the person at home being a man or a woman, as long as they're loving to the kids.      I don't want my kids to be raised by strangers at daycare, but I agree that 30-60 minutes at daycare isn't a bad thing.  It gives the kids social skills being around others outside the family.|`|BItkg1f0aa	i think its the decision of the houshold its self, if the husband and wife dicide that one stays home for thier personal family reasons then its non of anyones buisness....people need to stop judging and pay more attention to their own damn houshold, i dont think its important as to what one stays home, i think it just depends on what works out better for that family, other peoples household is no one elses concern but thier own|`|ml1d6EXcaa	Use them you need the money|`|nI6dyZCNaa	because children usually are attached to their moms, and dads like to work.|`|3ngp2L4Daa	I hate feminists.

My mother was a stay at home mom till my sister and i grew up a bit and then got a job, but not fully using her degree. It is the woman's choice, like in Marely and Me.|`|QJTOvC98aa	Shouldn't part of being a feminist be appreciating the differences of all women? And allowing women to follow their own hearts' desires, whether that is to stay at home with the kids or go out and work?    Essentially - its the mother's choice and her opinions that effect her life - so there is no right or wrong.|`|0XEOl49Yaa	A child needs its mother when it's young. I dont mean to go by the grain and say that men are the breadwinners, because that's not always the case.   If a woman has a very young child (or more than one, especially) she needs to stay home. A child has to ahve its mother when its young.     It is true that some women never get their careers back after they have children because, frankly, they don't want to and they don't think they need to. But after all your children have started school, its time to go get a job, mommies.|`|kej0H1AXaa	kids should be raised by families.  If a parent can stay home, that's great, if not, it's good to have the grandparents, uncles, and aunts around too.  Never put a kid in day care where they are just a number to "teachers" who don't care about them.|`|puOTqIBUaa	Every situation is different. Its none of my concern if a woman or man decides to stay home instead of use their degree. They earned the degree so whatever they do with it is their business.  *If you say that anyone who puts their kids in daycare shouldn't have kids then your a close-minded moron. I know a lot of ppl that put their kids in daycare and they are fine. I'm sure that there are bad daycare centers, but lets be honest there are some bad parents too.|`|7898bed61433434531784bc3ff2ec3e9aa	Wish I could answer this but I'm not a feminist by the traditional meaning.  I have a degree...magna *** laude from WVU, was a state supervisor, am a married mother of two.  I work only three hours a week (training) now and have very good reasons for doing so.  I don't judge women who work, who have or don't have kids or work and have kids.  It's all about personal choice, values, world views and economic reasons.  Whatever the case may be, I have been in each I listed, it's tough no matter which you choose.|`|KadJyjtBaa	I believe theres nothing wrong with those women who have their degrees and choose to stay at home. Its smart. Because they stay home taking care of their kids and the home. But she is independent because as soon as he is out the door she can put her degree to work. Its not important what sex stays home, for example my husband is a stay at home dad. Im in the army and live in ft carson. I get deployed to Iraq next year and he takes care of the home and the kids. Any sex can stay at home, what is important is that their is a parent who is watching and caring for the childrens needs as well as the homes.   Since birth children see that men are the machos who provide and women nurse. I think its wrong to give them that image. Men are important to their childrens lives but men feel they have to live up to their standards. Its important that both parents show they are present and help they children. Because you can be a stay at home mom and not do anything. You can be a dad and work your *** off and yet still make time for your kids.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	I have no problem with that.  Being a stay at home mom (or dad) is a choice that you make--noone forces you to do that.  I have plenty of respect for stay at home parents because it's a lot of work that doesn't come with a salary.|`|AKKWDcqnaa	disgraceful|`|QmIK2vgqaa	They belong at home in the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant. They should also be cooking some good food too -oh yeah, and cleaning the house like a good woman should.|`|eulMjLtPaa	I think if they have chosen to stay at home and raise the kids, great.  It's the hardest job in the world.      If there is a choice between the father and mother staying home in the first year of the child's life, I would opt for the mother.  After that, I think either is fine.|`|0hSpsSByaa	I am a feminist in believing in equal opportunities, equal pay, and equal respect for women.  I was raised by a stay-at-home mother and I have friends who are stay-at-home mothers or were when their children were younger.  The friends all have a bachelor's degree or more.  Although it was not my choice, I support their decision because they felt it was best in their situations.  Frankly, whether it is nature or nurture, on average, I think mothers are usually the better choice for staying at home with small children.  The mothers seem to tend to have more patience with younger children, and society makes it more difficult for men to stay at home. Moreover, the man usually still has the better paying job so it is usually more economically feasible for the mother to stay at home. However, there are always exceptions to all of the above, and I believe it is for each couple to decide what is best for their family.    Addendum:  Yes, fathers are important, even critical to a child's development, just as mothers are, but the involvment and interaction don't have to be the same to be just as important.

seMXuWwxaa	Let it go.  Try to explain your situation, but if she doesn't respond, just brush it off.  Some people act that way, or try to be "more holy" than you, but I don't look at that as being the Christian way to do things.  Be a friend to everyone, and don't be mean to her, but it's okay to distance yourself if she acts this way toward you and your friends.  She doesn't seem like the "true friend" type of person.|`|M2dr9Ykzaa	I think that you should just her go. It sucks that she turned out to be that kind of person, but you shouldnt push your other friend away to be with her. You should do what you really feel is right, and I think that sticking with your friend is the right thing to do. I dont think that you would be happy dumping your friend for her, it doesnt sound like that would be what you would normally do and I think you would regret your decision later.|`|ReborK5Naa	eplain to her what you mentioned up there, and then you will understand from her behavior what u should do....if she apologises then u can be good friends again!!!<br>  if not, u d better not think of her as a friend!|`|yoz5UbQkaa	let it go.<br>  she probably never wanted to be your friend in the first place.|`|Iw1m7Dhxaa	if she was a real friend she wouldnt care what your other friends were like, as long as you two had a good relationship(its not like your FORCING her to like him anyway)|`|JhvqUvlsaa	No sounds like she has issues right now so I would let her go.

iPNOVR6Gaa	The key here is not changing your physical attributes, it's being true to yourself.  So what if they like it?  If you don't, don't do it.  Have the kind of sex you like, and don't ever try to pretend to like something you don't.    Look at it this way: what if you were 5'6" and 130 lbs soaking wet?  If your theory were true that women like to be dominated, they'd just be out of luck.  You can likewise simply tell the women who like to be dominated that they are out of luck, because you don't like it and you're not going to do it.    Thank you very much for asking about your issue in a different way this time.  It was nice to be able to come at this from a slightly different direction.|`|AA11785285	She might if she's not very smart, not very educated, figures his smarts are better than hers, has no self confidence and is looking for a meal ticket.    Most women ---{uh, well, the ones I know--and frankly, I don't have any hs drop out biker tattoo chick babes with room temperature IQ's  as friends so I can't speak for them.....) like a guy who is kind, smart, witty, sharing, educated and accomplished  and able to admit mistakes.  She as well likes a guy who smiles, has a job he loves, and shares common interests with her.    The cave man crap?  For caveman IQ women, I'd guess.    And as far as appearance, the cover of the book has to be interesting enough to illicit her curiosity.  (Fat ain't pretty, neither are bad teeth)  But if when she opens it, it is a "shallow story", it goes no farther, and there for sure is no second date..... if there was even a first one.

It has come up in the bedroom though, and it was rather uncomfortable.  The switch happened each time during, so it wasn't like I could avoid it.  I don't care how "used to it" happening you can be, it's still uncomfortible to witness and it doesn't do a very good job of setting the mood.

AA10065812	A Child's Choice: What Is The Right Age For A Child To Choose Which Parent To Live With?  http://cabaraoke.newsvine.com/_news/2008...    Im a Fathers Rights Advocate for 20 years.       Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.    Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  Youre that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,    Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...  http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice  http://www.rcfp.org/taping/  http://www.glennsacks.com  http://www.parentalalienation.org/|`|VMY7No0eaa	call a family law firm... they can tell you FREE.|`|03e31964ea48bacd64475706a14630b1aa	He may be able to speak in court.

I would take it to court if I was you.|`|AA11226842	I don't think they actualy decide the court just takes their opinion into account.|`|YM1zhtKEaa	Call the county court house and ask that is your best bet in ga. i think it's 13|`|nZ7pGQfFaa	I live in NY and have been brought to court three times by my ex husband who was looking for full sole custody. My children are 10. The courts in NY provide a law guardian to the child and ask the child questions without you being present.  If you bring this to court and your son tells his law guardian that he wants to live with you because he lives there any way and that his mother is hardly ever present in his life.  I think the courts would award custody in your favor. The courts look at it from all angles.  They might think the child just wants to live with you because he can get away with things at your house and she is the stricter of the house holds.  But it doesn't sound like that is the case here. Be strong and go for it.  I hired my lawyer 3 times and to me I felt like I was wasting my money because I could've spoke on my own behalf due to me knowing the history between my children's father  then my lawyer did. With today's economy sinking, the lawyers will keep this in court for as long as they can so they keep collecting money from you. I say go for it, maybe you would qualify for a court appointed attorney.  Call the court house and ask questions and file a petition.|`|6ZxZoT7Raa	I think it really sad when things like this happens and it breaks my heart to know that it is happening everyday  Your son loves both you and his mother  I don't think they get to choice   But I also think that you both need to get join custody, it is fair|`|8sVpAO2yaa	I went through the same situation years ago. The judge talked to my child and based his decision on the interview and the opinion of our DHR representative. My son was allowed to make this decision at age 13. We live in Alabama but I don't think where you live is as important as "how" you live in a situation like this. I have full custody of my son and his father's parental rights were stripped from him. I think each family situation will be slightly different given the situation. I'd ask the attorney who handles your child support.

It is drama.  IF you are offended then you walk away..untless you are being attacked.  Then you aim somewhere else..not the face.    FEMALES need to understand...if you slap some guy...then they by defense should be able to slap you back.  Why is it ok for YOU and not them?  Violence is violence..and it is wrong male OR FEMALE..and a slap is violence.    If you are unhappy...walk away....but nothing but an attack calls for any slap.  That shows unintellegent human beings who let their emotions control them.    I do respect guys that walk away from being slapped..but you should not take that either.  Walk away from that girl and NEVER talk to her again.  In a  marriage you can call the cops for spousal abuse......|`|O3U7aLCDaa	I've slapped a guy like 200 times.

I know you want to make it work for ur child but don't because its not worth your pain or ur daughters either. Everyone deserves someone that will be faithful. Staying with him is showing ur daughter it is ok if a man cheats on you and you don't want that. Hope things work out for you and find someone that wants you and only you!!!!|`|VMY7No0eaa	once a cheater always a cheater.  he WILL DO IT AGAIN.  so either live with that   or leave|`|AA11603468	Why is it that you think you should just "get over it"? You start to feel better by taking control over your own life instead of stifling your feelings. You either require him to attend counseling (if that's your choice) or you kick him out of your life altogether. This ball is in yoru court. HE'S in teh wrong here, not you.     And, what if the girl had become pregnant. Would you be expected to assist in the care and raising of that child, too? Or, would he screw that poor child and never have anything to do with it? You better think about that, because you may be presented with this decision in the future.|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	Once a cheater always a cheater.

I almost want to say get out immediately, but I cheated on my boyfriend of 4 years. (our sex life was non existant) So from my stand point I say give him another chance. Although my boyfriend has to deal with that heartache everyday he has given me a second chance. I think people should only be given a second chance after that no third no fourth no nothing they haven't learned from their mistakes. It is really hard for me to see him hurrt like that especially since I'm the one that made him feel like that the person he loved and trusted. If he feels the same way and works for your trust and love back it's worth it. Everyday I have to prove to him I've changed it's hard but it's worth it. Maybe discuss why the cheating happened although it's no excuse you can possible work on the kinks in your relationship. Think to the future. There is a reason the people in your past didn't make it to your future.
JhvqUvlsaa	Honestly I thinkTrevor is justified in wanting to dump her if she never talks to him and only talks to other boys at school. She'll be devastated but they need to work it out between the two of them. So let it be.|`|yoz5UbQkaa	Talk to him
APy56tkZaa	Don't take my following comments as male bashing....<br>  When a partners "radar" flashes that something is wrong, the "radar" is rarely far from being wrong.<br>  <br>  I am not saying that you aren't doing everything you can to be a great father & husband.<br>  But obviously, something has set your wife off.<br>  I suggest that you both sit & speak openly using "I" sentences.<br>  Don't blame or argue.<br>  You both need to figure out what has her feeling insecure & unhappy in the relationship.<br>  I can't imagine that you are very cheerful while she is tormenting herself over this.<br>  <br>  Just be calm & do everything you can to reassure her of your love for her.<br>  Having a young child can sometimes be a hindrance to intimacy in a relationship.<br>  Try scheduling in a few hours of "couple time" once a week or find common interests that you two can share.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Apparently your wife has some history that is fueling her concerns.  It is very difficult for you to do anything.  She is the one that needs counseling to get some control of her emotions.  Just be patient and do your best to get her in to see a therapist.  Good luck.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Start accusing HER of cheating so she can see how it feels.<br>  After all, many very suspicious people are like that because of their own guilt. And she's alone all day...hmm...|`|f6YsGOynaa	Sit her down and tell her that you've never given her any reason to suspect you're cheating, so if she doesn't start giving you the benefit of the doubt, she needs to get herself into counseling for her trust issues.  If she doesn't get into counseling, suggest she find somewhere else to live, because you're tired of living with the Gestapo.|`|elhcuN19aa	She may be the one cheating<br>  ask her is she cheating on you and see what she says....<br>  Sometimes cheaters throw thier owns faults at you like it is your fault but it is not.|`|AA11401294	she is looking for a reason to justify the guilt of what she is doing to you...cheating.|`|eVK2zZsOaa	She seems like the type that will never be satisfied no matter what you say. She isn't going to stop because maybe she is guilty of something (did you ever think of that). Sometimes when people constantly accuse you, it is to cover up their own guilt. She is very insecure for some reason and it is up to you to figure out why. If she isn't willing to accept the fact that you aren't cheating maybe you should start threatening her with divorce, that might scare her into backing off.|`|UKqJiIlGaa	maybe she has been hurt in the past and has trust issues.  try counseling and reassure her; spend time with her and listen to her when she needs to talk|`|AA10684513	Have you ever thought that she is the one cheating since she is blaming you? Just a thought.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	If there is no trust, there is no marriage. Divorce!|`|16c036e95c139c3c978629e78d4185e1aa	she sounds very insecure, I think she needs to address why she is feeling this way..and seek help!|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	She needs therapy!!!!!! Its not you, its her. She needs professional help or you can see a therapist together. She also needs to know that accusations and insecurity will kill a marriage far faster than anything else will. <br>  Or you try the approach, of explaining, "The obsessive accuser is usually the guilty" Then start questioning her where abouts and cell phone use and whatever else you can think of. This of course will run your marriage straight to divorce court.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	First off have you ever given her a reason for her not to trust you?<br>  Second most of the time a person accuses another person of something is because they are reflecting their negativity on you.<br>  She is probably capable of cheating, or may have thought about cheating or is cheating that is why she is paranoid that you maybe. <br>  Or you have an 18 month old son and her figure may not be the same, she may have gained weight so she feels insecure about herself. <br>  Talk to her whatever the case maybe. Answer the phone in front of her, text back the wrong text messages that you are getting. And most important, tell her if you were cheating you would hide be hiding your phone, you would have a  cell from a different  cell phone company and she wouldn't have access to view the account. Everything is right there for her to check up on and question, so tell her that this is getting old, and she needs to put a stop to this. She needs to check herself on why she is constantly accusing you. Tell her that.<br>  Good luck to you.|`|5ca74cb9e6d3604c2c41d86d59b901beaa	talk to her, be heart felt and tell her that it hurts you and concerns you that she thinks you would cheat on her, maybe show her a good time out.have you noticed any change in her attitude since having the baby.It could all be a self-esteem thing and she doesn't want to say anything about it.Show her how much you love her and not just have sex with her, flowers, do things that you did that made her fall in love with you...suggest you renew your vows in 2 years..maybe just the talk of it will get her excited and bring new hope to your marriage.|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	sounds like either your lying through your teeth (I don't think so) or your wife has some serious, self worth issues.  This can become a serious problem, she may want to talk to someone professionally about it.  <br>  <br>  I mean are you home every night?<br>  <br>  Do you eat dinner out without her?<br>  <br>  Large timeframes where your not around and have <br>  no explanation as to where your are?<br>  <br>  <br>  If the answer is no to the above,  what kind of girlfriend does she think you have?|`|h9QWnWL0aa	Well no real answer here but be cautioned that if she is accusing you of cheating it is like that she is trying to direct attention that way cause she may be the one cheating, Had it happen to me|`|6XKlW3lyaa	start having sex with her so she doesnt have to worry about you cheating.|`|189233d5651c6d19d5903bb45454ecd9aa	Wow.  I'm guessing you feel exhausted by this, right?  That exhaustion is something you should not have to experience.  It costs you a little bit of your sanity and health every time you have to justify yourself to her.  That debt is going to keep adding up unless she stops this.<br>  <br>  Your wife sounds incredibly insecure, and may not be capable of maintaining a trusting, healthy marriage.  That is NOT your problem... it's hers.  <br>  <br>  Trouble is, if you start talking to her about it, or threatening to "take a break" or simply go to counseling, you will probably get a very specific response.  She will probably say, "You're just like everyone else.  You're going to leave me, you don't love me, I was right," and so on.<br>  <br>  If you get this response, then unfortunately, you have to get OUT.  I have seen this a lot, and it will never get better. I watched a very close friend go through two divorces because she had this same attitude.  Ultimately, I had to stop being friends with her. There was never enough love, never enough "proof" in her life, and no one could make her happy... not even me or her other friends.  <br>  <br>  If your wife believes you're cheating, going to leave her, etc., there is nothing you can do.  She will always believe this, and she will ALWAYS make you feel guilty, no matter what you do.  If you stay or go, you'll never hear the end of it.<br>  <br>  If, on the other hand, she says "Yes" to a trial separation or other options to work on your marriage, you might be in better shape.  She might just be going through a phase because of the baby or some other issue in her life.  There may be hope.<br>  <br>  No man who is a good husband and provider should be accused of this.  She is not treating you with respect or fairness.  If this continues, when your son gets older, it will cause him to have deep trust issues himself.  (Parents lead by example, and children learn from what they see.)  Take a deep breath, assert yourself and your rights, and do what's best for you and your child.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and stay strong.|`|DzAFT8VDaa	I feel for you, bro. She is SEVERELY insecure and constantly reassuring her is going to get old.  If you are giving her no reason to believe you are cheating, she has to take your word for it. She is your wife and your relationship HAS to be built on trust. If not, you have nothing.<br>  <br>  Does she have friends and a life outside of you and your child? Do you think counseling with a pastor or rabbit or psychological professional would be something she'd agree to?<br>  <br>  She needs to get a handle on herself. Encourage her to open up about WHY she thinks you're cheating. It seems as if it has nothing to do with your behavior. She may be lonely at home without you, insecure because her body has changed after the baby, etc.<br>  <br>  Be patient, loving and try to get her to talk honestly about HER feelings.  Good luck.|`|eFtyNGcXaa	Have u done something in the past to make her feel this way? flirt with other women? has she had previous relationships who cheated on her? Did she have a stable family growing up ...was her father faithful?Does she feel good about herself? Do u give her compliments on her looks, cooking, etc...Do u make her feeel that she is the best thing that ever happened in your life? u treat her like a princess? With a baby, things may be stressful. I think both should have a heart to heart talk about how you feel when she accuses u and find out what she is feeling. Also see a marriage counselor to help sort out the problem. all the best.

As long as you keep in in check he should not care.<br>  <br>  BUT if you grow a sweater on your back that would probably turn most everyone off!<br>  <br>  My wife is very hairy where her bikini covers (front and back) and she doesn't wax but just keeps it trimmed and I am fine with that!  Hair is normal, bald is not!
JppKTOPnaa	Jewelry always sick, if you can afford it and have been going out long enough. Maybe six months. If not jewelry a vacation would be probably the top three. Everything now days seems cliché, especially if your giving it to her in front of everyone. The final idea I have isn't one particular thing. Be creative. Think of your entire relationship. Possibly bring her to locations of good memories to reminisce. If all else fails buy her some really nice flower, something untraditional with a hand written poem.|`|CM1dfztQaa	Flowers are always a great gift. They're classic and simple. If you go that route, try to find out what her favorite flower is and try to incorporate it into the bouquet. That will show her that you cared enough to figure her out.<br>  <br>  A poem is also a good idea, but if you're not comfortable writing one yourself, it's okay to borrow someone else's as long as you give that poet the credit (write his/her name at the end). Tell her you read this poem and it reminded you of her. She'll be putty in your hands. lol.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your date.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	A necklace or a bracelet. It does not have to cost a lot, My husband gets me costume jewelery a lot and I find it to be rather pretty if it's made well. Wal-Mart has a lot to choose from price range included.|`|RZl7aPxnaa	the best thing to show how you feel would be to send jewelery. as the best to show that you love her send either a ring or necklace with their birth stone on it. this will mean so much more to her than normal jewelery. as she will also always cherish this.|`|bljEhh86aa	a nice watch nothing expensive nothing cheap, between $60.00 to $100.00  have it engraved "TIME VERY WELL SPENT". or "I ENJOY EVER SECOND SPEND WITH YOU".|`|c2uywBsIaa	before you take her out just get her some flowers.<br>  It's small, not expensive, and it shows that you care.|`|qGS4oR11aa	a heart locket with a picture of you and her in it|`|q791er1naa	That is really sweet.  I wish I knew men like you.<br>  <br>  Get something that is personal to her.  I dont know her so I cant suggest anything.  An ex boyfriend of mine bought me a build-a-bear that was decked out in hello kitty clothes.  Im 24, but he knew I loved hello kitty as a child so it really flattered me that he remembered me mentioning that.  Anything to that affect.|`|qKpgMkjSaa	Dude if you have time, make her something! It'll show her really how much you care, cause you went out of your way to do something. You can always buy her something but when you make it, it comes from your heart.|`|OAYaeW22aa	im not into gifts that much. i recommend that u shuld take her on a trip to go sightseeing but even tho it sucks to go it show s you would do anything for her. and dont say "I didnt pay for this to not go" or sumtin like that.|`|EzNxSIVeaa	Think about stuff she is into.  What hobbies does she have?  <br>  <br>  When I started dating a man I later married, one little thing he had gotten me was a painting easel because I really like to paint.  It was something inexpensive that showed he paid attention.|`|TCcfYPSlaa	A red roses.<br>  or her fave flowers!<br>  Simple but everygirl loves flowers!|`|qeVqBMVraa	a bracelet, very expensive one<br>  or take her out to a romantic dinner|`|ou2vZnkqaa	a hand written card.|`|UKqJiIlGaa	a simple piece of jewelry that she can wear and think of you|`|5Rn5BHjQaa	A small box of chocolates, a book on a subject she really enjoys or by an author she likes, a small pretty box to keep on her dresser, a really nice piggy bank, a teddy bear... Go browse a gift store and see what's available.<br>  <br>  (If you don't mind my going a bit off-topic, you might consider giving it to her on an occasion when it's just the two of you. Gift-giving in front of another couple who aren't exchanging gifts sounds a bit awkward.)|`|J2u6kOPxaa	well im 15 so i understand if you wouldn't really listen to what im gonna suggest. Well, if she knows u love her then that would be enough. Being there for her is already a gift. Even loving her is a gift,<br>   <br>  Im not saying gifts are bad but i don't like being materialistic.She should be satisfied. But it is nice to give gifts most of the time. But it would really be more special if you give something you made. But of your now creative then just stick on buying something like a beautiful candle, a perfume, a glass or cup with extravagant designs.. You'll come up with something.|`|wHTErwGgaa	Something you know about her<br>  <br>  Does she like - horses, singing, music, dancing, dogs, painting<br>  <br>  You could make you own personal card, POEM is always a good thing, and maybe write some of your past experiences in the poem, if not some of her hobbies & how much you like her. You could start the poem by writing 'I know this girl called ****' If she's a romantic type, take her out to something she enjoys & just act like there's no other girl in the world you'd rather spend time with<br>  <br>  Hope this helped|`|yo32Z3axaa	A women is always impressed by a guy that is observant usually a women will tip you off by the things that she talks about or what she looks at when passing a store. I think accessories maybe a nice set with earrings and necklace.But nothing too expensive and make sure it goes with her style|`|MWSPSBMFaa	Um can you be my boyfriend? :) <br>  <br>  My guy neverrrr does things like that for me. I would suggest something like a flower, such as a Daisy or a Tulip (not your typical Rose). It shows you put thought into it. A little stuffed animal might be cute too. <br>  <br>  Either way the fact that you're even putting thought into this shows you are a great guy and she should feel lucky to have you. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|my2EVHW4aa	How romantic and sweet!  I suggest flowers- they are an eloquent expression of care.  You may want to include a cute teddy bear for her to hold and associate with you!  Good luck... and don't let the romantic gestures ever ever stop!  Women love romance!|`|YgSrgTFzaa	anything you made even if its just a card. She will love it and she'll love you! One of my friends made a gingerbread house for his girlfriend for christmas and she loved it. Make it from the heart and she will love it!|`|a7VjpoNxaa	giver her a  gift dat looks very expensive (but it should not be expensive hehe) . you can refer the link for gift idea's|`|rdDM4lcxaa	it depends on her situation and u guys' situation as a couple.<br>  how long have u been together?<br>  what kind of things are really important to her?|`|AunZaJOEaa	Necklace|`|XPf2nk3saa	Little ornaments :)<br>  Or a Me2U Teddy!
5r2Csdzwaa	Not your money to spend. That DOLT will be doing the Chris Brown on you when he gets home.|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	Do you work?  If your married isn't your money pooled together collectively?  You can't spend any money without clearing it with him first?  It sounds like you need to sit down together and sort out how you are doing your spending.  This doesn't sound like a healthy thing to have to worry about.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	You did nothing wrong, you spent the money wisely.  If he is adult enough to understand, then you should not have a problem.  If he is childish and abusive, then you need to re-evaluate this relationship.  Good luck.|`|B12E4rYiaa	If you're married the money is supposed to belong to both of you. Even if you are a stay at home mom you still work you just work at home and take care of the house and kids which is the hardest job of all and a huge responsibility. You didn't spend foolishly so don't sweat it he'll get over it.|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	Shame on these HATERS to say GET A JOB !!Half these people up here are NOT even married / do not know how to KEEP A MAN PERIOD !.Bunch of B.S .Let him get over his child like tantrum being with his ____ is enough .You should not have to ask for $ or hide it from him either ,YOU are his wife so he has to deal with it .Who else are you supposed to ask or get $ from ?? He needs just  to GROW UP .Its not like you did anything wrong with it anyway ...what a JERK I say !|`|GI27dKIkaa	You're lucky he or the bank isn't suing you for theft !<br>  <br>  Using someone else's card - whether they're related to you or not is a CRIMINAL offence !|`|IfwpibHqaa	i don't blame him, you should have asked him first if you could use it!!|`|elhcuN19aa	Wth?<br>  No joint account?<br>  And why is he acting like a clown? Your husband is greedy and childish....<br>  It is not like you went on a shopping spree on yourself...<br>  Antivirus is useful and your child may have needed some clothes?<br>  You guys need to talk about this...<br>  I noticed that marriages with separate accounts tend to not last...<br>  that 50/50 stuff never works out<br>  <br>  are you guys even married?<br>  <br>  If he continues to get mad like this I would advise you getting income of your own and your own account and dont spend a dime on him....|`|JSruV3Wuaa	And so he should!<br>  <br>  Be responsible - use your own card.  At the very least ASK HIM if you can use it after explaining why you can't use your own.  And then, make sure you reward him if he lets you use it.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	What kind of a marriage is this where there is such poor communication and cooperation with respect to the finances?|`|fRIEHBJOaa	did you STEAL the card from him? does he withold money from you and felt desperate? what's going on here? why did you use his card and not your own? i need more information.|`|AA11401294	That is his problem for giving you access!|`|5ca74cb9e6d3604c2c41d86d59b901beaa	you should have talked to him about it first especially if you been through it before|`|mCM363I9aa	get a job and spend your own money|`|8GfEEzzhaa	Last time i checked, in a marriage, the money belong to both parties, no matter who earned them at work. Yet, it is only fair if before spending money you both consult each other. So he is wrong to call it his money, and you are wrong not to have consulted him.<br>  <br>  In your situation you need to have a serious talk concerning these two wrongs. 125pounds won't make a difference. what is important is that you clear the issues of your marriage regarding money.|`|Yleae8hiaa	Do you work? I don't ask that to be mean, because I understand that if he is the bread winner and you  work at taking care of thing, you should be able to spend something. But what you bought, was it absolutely a necessity? <br>  Maybe he has the bi figured on a budget and that cut into something. I think you to need to sit down and look how the money is spent. My next question is why did you use his bank card and not your own? Does he control the money. If you do not have a job, I would get one, even if it is part time.|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	I can understand him going mad. Just because he is your husband and money wasn't spent on you doesnt give you the right to spend his money without asking. <br>  Try and talk to him when he has calmed down and discuss him possibly giving you an allowance for money to spend on your son. <br>  Otherwise you should probably think about getting a job and having your own money.|`|ba68b7d25060c3e787c80b35c1ab4f14aa	as long as the account didnt go overdraft then fu*k it who cares . ya married its not jus his money anymore.. but it will be nice if u would call him b4 spending it.. tell him like hey babe  i wanna buy "isaac" some clothes is it ok  if i spent like 80bucks?.. oh and the anti virus ws 35 k? cus maybe the money he had was for something else like for car insurance, food, rent. etc...once u work ul know its not easy to jus spent" it w/o  good reason.|`|4RgXh3ftaa	Thats not that much money to be worried about, Im sure he will get mad, but he will get over it. If most of it was for your son you tell your husband that your son needed stuff. He's gotta understand that.. if not like I said he will get over it:)|`|Zca1PGERaa	hes probably mad because you didnt tell him you spent the money which may have left him short on spending in a shop if it went declined or something.|`|fNgv2FeRaa	Did you ask first and get his permission?<br>  <br>  If not he should be getting you done for theft.|`|brSfRLspaa	work the corner|`|fAdh5BAkaa	get a job
n05KVINnaa	its not a love triangle (well to be really honest its not a love anything) its a pentagon if 5 ppl are involved..if you spent more time on ya math in class i nstead of texting on your phone you would know this and also not be freaking out in tears.. Maybe Jim will Fix It for you ....and you...and you . . .and you ...and you !!!!|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Don't get herpes.|`|lqVaemWraa	maybe they are just like makeing you jelous on purspose. and he might just be a player. what grade are you in? if danielle has lied she might be telling the truth cuz sometimes it happens. i owuld just go one like nothing happend and just start covos not INCLUDING alex. If you want him to like you again lol just be yourself and don't bring up anything about that little triangle. it will wrok trust me! hope this helped! =]
dPULl5hjaa	That's a very strong statement.  Talk to your parents and voice your concern.  They'll tell you how to handle the situation.|`|v398Qalyaa	do you have proof though? if they are under adult age, yes, sounds gross...|`|3y0w1qIBaa	If they are underage, then yes, you should tell their parents because that's just gross.|`|tsPGVVWcaa	I think you should advise someone about what is going on this is sick and wrong!|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	no if they both are doing because they enjoy it is their own Business|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	If there minors yes, but it there both adults then I wouldn't say a thing.|`|Tg6ySuUOaa	yep|`|AA12012230	Urm... Hoping you're a troll. You must be certain something is going on before speaking to parents. Possibly speak to a teacher.    *Please be a troll*|`|cPpP4BZIaa	IF YOU KNOW THIS FOR SURE, AND NOT JUST ASSUMING THEY ARE, YOU SHOULD BRING IT TO THEIR PARENTS ATTENTION.|`|p9t9mzuraa	..........  That's kind'a sick.  If you're absolutely POSITIVE, and they are underage, yes. That should be stopped, I mean, within reasonable laws etc. I'm sure their parents need to know...    Oh man, think about that though! Don't twins have that brain connection thing going on? That'd be SO weird! LOL|`|fXPD45Jwaa	wow  sounds hard....well  iff they are underage...yes  their parents have to know whats going on  what would happen...if the sister get a disabled kid?  what would you think?  bad conscience maybe?  are the twins doing it for fun...or even love???|`|7GQuGVzmaa	yes i think you should that's illegal and they could have kids that are sisters and brothers and cousins!|`|d08rkYlpaa	There are some estimates that incest is more prevalent among twins than other siblings, so this is not as surprising as you might think. There is already an incredibly strong bond of identity and dependence between twins, so a sexual bond as well seems almost incidental. If they are quite young, it might just be exploration, discovering sexuality, and not too worrisome. If they are at or above the age of consent, I would stay out of it, just because such things can have legal ramifications, and when it's consensual they aren't hurting anybody. In that case the "cure" of exposure and the accompanying guilt and rejection by society is more harmful than the problem. But if they are underage teens, or one is being coerced, then something should be done.    In traditional Balinese culture a set of twins of the opposite sex were forced to marry each other, since it was assumed that they had sex in utero. In traditional Mohave culture, opposite sex twins were thought to have been married in heaven.|`|2KjBXjLKaa	Why would any one want to interfere with two people who are quite likely in love. It is possible the two of them may just enjoy the sex, and quite likely they are not planning to have children if they are young. Unless there is evidence of birth defects in the ancestors, you would not even have a reason to suggest genetic counseling to them.    Incest is not as evil as many make it out to be, and even if a child(ren) results, the possibility of a birth defect is minimal, not much more than it would be for unrelated partners. My advice is to leave them be and definitely don't involve the parents.|`|Y8CnQfePaa	it depends how old they are. if they're over 18 or 21 (depending on what state, etc) then they should do what they want. But unless you're a really close family friend or they at least know you, then I don't think it's any of your business. I think it's nice that you care, but sometimes it's better to keep family dirt inside the family and let them figure it out on their own, it's better that you stay out of it so they don't pull you into the drama later on.|`|Rd9QMpZLaa	mind yo business!|`|Dr8KckbLaa	Yes. Definitely.     But also, who are you to them? Relative, friend???|`|Ejp91kLeaa	YES because that's illegal and can cause deformed kids!
NuUdCz0Laa	If your just in the dating phase of this relationship, then you take care of all your own children's expenses.  He does the same.  Once this relationship turns into marriage, then it all comes out of the household budget.|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	If your just starting dating when you go out you pay half the time and he pays half the time.  Vacation you pay for yourself and your kids he does the same.  Rent and bills should be split down the middle.  If you married it should all just come out of the household account where both your pay checks go.  <br>  <br>  Under no circumstances should he always pay for it all.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I don't recall seeing any rules about this anywhere.  The two of you discuss this and settle on what is mutually acceptable.  Simple as that.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming since there are 5 children involved in this quasi-marital relationship, the two of you are serious.  I disagree that you do things one way and then change them upon marriage and find that thinking ill-advised, especially in remarriage.|`|8GfEEzzhaa	Who makes more money? If you make equal amount, pay your bill (or pay half of the time you go out). If he makes more money let him pay the bill a bit more often than you. If you get more money, pay the bill a bit more often. I'd personally find it weird if two parties take out calculators and start dividing the bill.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Split it as two families. Actually do what works best for different situations. Rent 50/50. Vacation 50/50. Otherwise just do what comfortable.|`|GtPnXzPAaa	You pay for yours, he pays for his. Seems easy enough.
OuQJYm4zaa	It's good that neither of those are your life,  because what will you do if you lose them?  who knows one day get into some weird accident,  lose your hearing orrrrr one day your friend has to move across  the country. It's good to be your own and have those things  "accompany" your life rather them just be it,  because those are thing that can be taken away very easily  and you'll be left with nothing.  and don't sweat the things you talk about,  that's purely who you are and someday  you'll find someone who loves that,  someone who is just like that and it'll be fine.  be proud of being unique.|`|KcvinDvgaa	Heh sounds like me and my friend, how about finding some music you like and sharing it with her :) I'm sure you love at least one song :P And you guys should have this thing where you look for new music, burn CDs and exchange them once in a while   (cause thats what i do with family and friends!)  This way you guys don't have to talk about music all the time, but during those times you exchange cds.  try looking on garageband.com, last.fm, and myspace.com/music for new artists/ bands!  GOOD LUCK :)|`|0ujQ0zl2aa	tell her. i had a friend who was controlled by her dad.  seriously confront her. otherwise don't complain.  if you don't tell her how you feel nothing will get done because of it.|`|3wAkbWqSaa	do not worry.  my bff *look @ this michelle**  talks about books, bad (in both ways) movies, and songs i have never heard of......BUT I STILL LOVE HER TO DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just be yourself.....perhaps she is just jokin....ud never no???>?>?>|`|aNKqm0YIaa	Be yourself and btw its almost impossible to find friends that share everything in common with you! Maybe she could teach you more about music and you could teach her more about something else.
8901e2819a6bc62c741fd8706d58f081aa	This is where you learn about real life. And you learn to tolerate people you dont particularly like.  Living together with so many different personalities is always going to be stressful.   Its best not to repeat a b*tchy remark youve heard, as you will be the one they blame.  When youve done this year, perhaps you can get another place with less people in.  The more people, the more stress.|`|fo5VHocxaa	dunno|`|AA12012230	I've been there- I presume you're in your first year. I would advise you to play the game and live with it. When you move next year make sure that you live with friends. Just be tolerant. Why not spend time with other friends, join a few extra clubs so you're out of the house or spend time in your room.|`|GDav4xAtaa	sounds like a normal girl in my school even if they are best freinds they do that they most likely just dont wanna say it to thier friends face|`|lgXSmCQRaa	I know what you mean, can we talk? Im also having probs with mine and I dont have anyone to talk to about it|`|PogMq7Pcaa	they soudn like popular bitches and u sound like a nerd|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Are you on America's Next Top Model?|`|d5348844fa0d0a525f373ae1f2bf3a78aa	i think it's probably them. maybe opt for more mature roommates in the future. or just get your own apartment.|`|JmdnlQsHaa	theyre girls in a close-knit environment.  that explains everything
mzYsk112aa	Picky eaters are that way because they are allowed to be.  She only eats jelly sandwiches because that's what you pack for her.   Pack her a lunch that would be better for her.  She may not eat lunch for a couple days but, I promise you, a child will not starve it's self.  If this is a battle you are ready to pick, it's a battle you have to win.  You can not lose to your child or your child will lose respect for you.|`|Dr8KckbLaa	Well, it's normal for young children to be picky. I have a younger sister in 2nd grade, and she's super picky and won't eat any vegetables & is really selective with meals.    Try to offer foods like turkey sandwiches, peanut butter and fluff, grilled cheese, any sort of lunch meat sandwich or hoagie...or maybe those Lunchables. Most little kids love them and they are so convenient!     Good luck, and know that this is totally normal!|`|FwJLD1uDaa	thats very common! just insist that she eats something new, like some veggies with cheese or some yummy fruits with whipped cream. good luck :)|`|pErRGYH7aa	Who's in charge in your house?  It sounds like your daughter is.  Pack something healthy and if she refuses to eat it, she will go hungry.  After a few days of going hungry, she may decide that carrots, apple slices, and lunch meat aren't so bad after all.|`|4dThwKqXaa	little kids are lawyas picky eaters. she iwll grow out of it.|`|6ZxZoT7Raa	That is just a phase  Try tricking her with a different healthier sandwich  If that doesn't work then just but her in a sport or something so she stays fit and make sure she get healthy drinks that give her the vitamins she needs.  Gradually she will get out of that stage :)|`|JaNE0HKyaa	It is just a phase my kindergartner did the same thing it lasted about a month. My son likes to take lunch ables. He also likes to take any kind of soup in his lunch. Put it in the themas hot and it is just right by the time they go to lunch.
af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	You need to seek counseling to help you understand why you feel so insecure. Extreme jealousy usually leads to a break-up, so do it ASAP.|`|BUET39wmaa	you don't want to hear this but you being like that will just push her away from you so if you want your relationship to be strong you will trust her and lover her until or if ever she proves you wrong.|`|AA12085256	Two qualities you must have before you get into a relationship:  1.  Maturity  2. Trust......  Without either...your relationship is doomed, especially in a long distance relationship.  If I were you I'd try to figure out why I have such insecurities and talk to my partner and perhaps a counselor about it.  Good Luck!|`|STzGEyDAaa	To be honest its a bit extreme when you are constantly getting angry  and jealous over little things. You will just end up pushing her away because you are becoming too controlling ! There is no point in going out with someone if you don't trust them. I know you said that you do but you really dont !|`|L38M9lrLaa	Tell her your paranoid because of the way she treats you.what she did was mean and hurtful..dont give up|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	I was with a guy like that when I was young and it DID push me away.  I mean you have to get a grip.  Getting jealous over people on TV that she's never going to see in real life? He used to do the same thing. He'd get jealous over bands we used to go see, again, guys I had very little chance of meeting or talking to.  Guys I had no interest in but it just finally got to the point where his insecurity and his accusations finally pushed me to the point where I got fed up.    She's with you for a reason.  You have to remember that.
OQsj0Am3aa	Speak to a lawyer.|`|AA11366224	This depends on what the will actually says and the legal jurisdiction governing it.  If it's subject to English law, your stepmother is committing a criminal offence and could be extradited to the UK to face charges.  Get yourself a lawyer.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	She is not. Get yourself a good solicitor and go after what your Dad left you.|`|pErRGYH7aa	I'm not familiar with UK laws regarding inheritance.  You should retain an attorney, because I believe that as executor/executrix of his will, she is legally obligated to ensure that the terms of his will are fulfilled.  However, you're dealing with International laws if she's living in France.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	No of course she's not allowed to do it.  See a solicitor as soon as possible.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	thats terrible of her! you deserve what he wanted you to have - if she wont give it to you, its possible your father can still help you...|`|Dr8KckbLaa	She's not allowed as long as the will is legitimate and legal, in which case the lawyer should take care of it. That's a pretty nice inheritance!|`|gK0W7cUFaa	i think you should take it to the cops?..  maybe they can arange it for you?  i think it would be best instead of argin  and making it worse?..|`|KqIDH7oVaa	you need to see a solicitor to find out if a will was left etc, if you are indeed the oldest of his offspring you should be entitled to something
mO7FOXNYaa	While I see your point and would probably have the same feelings - I think this is a situation where you put your pride away. Split the cost. Shop together so that you two find a mattress that works for both of you.  Sell the old mattress and you keep ALL of the money since you paid for it in the first place.<br>  <br>  Sometime we have to make sacrifices in our relationships - even when we know we are right.|`|5ca74cb9e6d3604c2c41d86d59b901beaa	i think you both should split the cost because you said "we gave away his bed"..why should he had given up his bed which was comfortable for im to sleep on a bed that's only right for you.The start of a a great relationship is compromise..you have to know when to give and take hun.|`|d9ef15eaf37ce8235169ad9e9562f2bfaa	did you use this bed for anything other than sleeping while you split up. If you did...  give it away too.|`|e62f95518e0bb700635945c8033d6bceaa	Who gave away the old mattress?<br>  <br>    They do sell plain square mattress frames that hold up the bed but don't have a headboard or foot board. They also sell mattress toppers that work pretty well. Explore both and see if you both can reach a compromise.<br>  <br>    It would be a good compromise and cost a lot less.<br>  <br>    As for your question about paying for a new mattress......I'd go for the compromise first. Then I would most likely help pay for a different mattress because I'd want my SO to be comfortable and a bed is kind of important part of a relationship. <br>  <br>    I can understand why you may not want to pay for a new mattress but is this an issue that is really worth the trouble of splitting hairs over?|`|xNkmK0SHaa	If you"children" can't come to an agreement about something as simple as who pays for a mattress, you will NEVER agree on anything of a more serious nature.<br>  Split now and stay apart.  One or both of you is not mature enough for a serious relationship.
JhvqUvlsaa	If they do brag about it to your face ask them to please not do that because you can't go and it's not fair. If they won't listen then don't hang around them when they've gone to High Rollers. If they ask why you're snubbing them tell them it is cuz you have asked repeatedly for them to not brag about High Rollers but they won't listen and see if they apologize and change their ways. If not then it doesn't look like they care about your feelings so you need to find friends that will treat you with more respect|`|N4Ct35GFaa	If they start to talk about it, emit a low growl to remind them to stop.  If they continue to speak of this, simply break their legs.|`|EmC8wvMsaa	Bring up another subject when they talk about high rollers, talk about say, um a movie? Anything to grab their attention...|`|SGQwTMWLaa	Do something else, that is cooler/better than high rollers.

How many other people do you know have been married 65 years.  Both of my suggestions involve wedding bells.  First I had a large table cloth embroidered for my wife & I 35th anniversary.  It had the wedding bells, Happy 35th anniversary, date of marriage & current date along with our names.  I matched the tablecloth to dining room color.  Cost was $145.00 done here in MD.  Just this week, I had a towel set made up for my brother & his wife's 50th anniversary with gold bells & same info on table cloth. The towel set cost about $40.00  Check your yellow pages for local embroidering shops,  I believe you can go online and order embroidered items.|`|6ZxZoT7Raa	That cool they have been together for so long :)  You should think of things to do around there house because they are older and can't do alot of things they could when they were younger  Trust Me They Will Be Thankful :)|`|WDwEyZFXaa	1. Gift certificate to their favorite restaurant.    2. Create one of those calendars that you personalize with your own photos. My aunt and uncle gave one to my grandparents for Christmas with old photos of all their kids and grandkids growing up. Everyone loved it. I know they sell them at snapfish.com.
hMZQd7Cpaa	I think you should talk to him & tell him how you feel about it. Guys dont know how a girl feels about things. And maybe you can move with him. If he really loved you he would stay with you here. (:|`|kW371HVMaa	if florida is good for him than why are u saying no! ur holding him back from oppurtunity! how could you?! if u really loved him then u will let him leave!!|`|4cQKBkqCaa	I totally understand that you might miss him, but how long have you been together? If there is no long term commitment or anything, just value the time you had together and go your seperate ways. But if you think you could be serious about each other, Is it possible to go with him or at least keep the long distance thing  going for awhile?     And second of all, if he's only thinking he *might* go, don't freak out until you know for sure! He might stay!
zTT3MZk8aa	Where do you live? I have a dress that I am trying to sell and I am the same weight and pant size?? I can sent you pictures if you are interested??  I have tried to sell it for the past 3 years now.... E-mail me if you are interested and would like pictures... Playboytx22@sbcglobal.net|`|NcEx6FE5aa	Go down to Davids Bridal, have them take your measurements and they can tell you what size dress u need.  Wedding dresses like that have weird sizes, I'm a 6 and had to order an 8 in my dress.  I would not buy online though because dresses that i loved ended up looking weird or cheep in person, i would try it on.|`|yhgRaBPXaa	You should go into the store to get fitted. Wedding dresses fit a little different from regular clothes. Even if you dont get a dresss there, you can try a few on to get a feel for how you want it to fit, then order one online. Dont leave it up to chance because shipping for a wedding dress is expensive!|`|sGP6s7uraa	You'll need to measure your bust, your waist and your hips.  Usually, they have size charts based on these measurements along with tips and advice (i.e. half sizes order one size up).  This is really the only good way to order online.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Go to the store and get fitted. Gown sizing is entirely different than regular clothes. If you go in you will also get a better idea of what styles you like. You can certainly still order online but it is important to get the proper size.    Good luck!|`|ZfleGhXLaa	The information you have given is not sufficient to properly size you for a bridal gown.  You need to know your measurements.  Here is a link to the size chart at davids bridal, so you can see what measurements you need:    http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...    (Click the size chart tab)      Even if you do buy your gown online, if you have no experience in measuring yourself for clothing I highly recommend you go in to the store and have someone measure you.  Most people will measure themselves improperly if they do not know how to do it.|`|b9Hl0ITnaa	You will need to be measured as that is how they order them.  Most likely you will be fitted for a 10 or 12 in size.  They can be usually 2-4 sizes bigger in formal gowns than your normal street size.  Also style of the dress makes a difference and material.  Corset back allows movement with size.  Good luck.
GeruGGOQaa	Why did you marry her?|`|BUET39wmaa	wtf????????????  why haven't you slept together????|`|UgcPxd4maa	why haven't you hit that yet?? Its half your fault you know...|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	WTF?  Um, try to consummate first, before you do anything else. What the hell is wrong with her?    EDIT- I suspect past abuse, probably in her childhood. What happens next depends if you really love her or not.  If you love her, you need to get her into intensive counseling to find out why she is so resistant to sex.    If you don't love her, then get an annulment...because a sexual relationship is expected as part of a marriage. She has let you down.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Stay with her for another 3 months and see if there is another immaculate conception.|`|v398Qalyaa	before you storm ahead with an annullment, try and sit her down and ask without accusing what is wrong, it could be she is afraid, or has been brought up very strictly, maybe thinks sex is dirty etc, could you get near her before the wedding? it does seem odd, but you need answers|`|fb5Njg7gaa	That's ridiculous. Why didn't you say something months ago. This should have happened on your wedding day. Ask her outright what the problem is and say it has to be addressed right now or your leaving.  She must have some serious hang ups about sex to not have wanted to by now.|`|AA11011446	Are you saying you've been married to her for 6 months and you haven't had sex yet????  Have you spoken to her about this?  This doesn't sound right at all.|`|Ne7xr36Saa	absolutely...get it annuled.

I think there is a bigger issues here have you at all tried to find out what it is or do you sit there waiting for her to jump you?    i mean you might as well get it annuled because you both can't even communicate|`|AA11706291	I think it can be annulled as you've still not consummated the marriage.|`|WKiAISZdaa	I think you should reside yourself to the fact that your wife is having an affair.|`|zoyw8CRKaa	Your a troll and pathetic get a life!|`|EHSLaWpXaa	if you havent had sex yet due to health reasons,then stay with her. if shes just being stingy then leave her ***.|`|q0hZBDrVaa	make love to her and fast. tell her to spread 'em|`|aSjdL4heaa	If you haven't consummated in six months then you have serious problems.  If you want to have anything approaching a normal life you need to divorce/annul (you can annul an unconsummated marriage)|`|STzGEyDAaa	You shouldn't get an annulment at this stage in your marriage.  Really try to " with her because it will show your intimacy for one another !   Remember, she might be thinking the same thing and so you should talk to her !

Was she sexually abused before you and just has a hard time with it?     Maybe you should seek professional help :) it's not normal. That's one of the best things about marriage!|`|819ad8842ebdf96b383c9430aef4be6eaa	Maybe get some counseling.  I'm sure they've seen this problem before.  I suggest talking to her about it.  She's probably waiting for you to take action!  Get a sex book and try the exercises?  Annulment is a religious thing, technically you'd still be married and you would have to get a divorce if you wanted to split up.  Try to make it work first.|`|jlOSmp7Eaa	If the marriage has not yet been consummated,then by all means it is eligible for an annulment,but before you do this you must try and discuss this with your wife and see if you can't find a reason for it,maybe this is her first time and she's scared,or maybe she's not a virgin and she's afraid that you will be able to tell and then you will be angry with her,but you really should talk about things and try and work it out,there is more to a marriage than just sex,but don't get me wrong,you have to have SOME sex!!|`|4a3a7d2a2bd6aa1d3814d6d9e39a668daa	wow ive never known anyone thats married and still no sex.... communicate with her... maybe something happened in her past and is bothering her.. but its been a long time, i still cant believe u have waited so much... but oh well talk to her and wait to see what happens...|`|1rHgZ0Y8aa	Liar|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	Its  kinda  unusual fo  this type of thing to happen these days.  Your  patience is virtuous. Do you  love her? if  so  give  it more time, if you  don't  then  seek an  annulment.  Before going any further though it would  be  wise  to  seek Professional   medical  help  for her  since a  6 month long period is not normal and could be symptomatic of a real gynaecological problem which if  un treated  could  lead  to her death.|`|Q7j5b9R1aa	You wan?ker didn't you realise that she was a he before you married.it .

xF8TvlhYaa	Ask her reason for sudden change. She alone can give the real reason for her new thinking.   Sympathy also necessary for any one. How sympathy spoils love?|`|xOE3xdKEaa	maybe its high time u stopped lending her a listening ear and started giving her advice.. maybe wen u listen to her, she thinks that u feel pity for her.. offer her solutions next time..|`|78m1v4imaa	Even though she is saying she has doubt of such love you carry.    Do you still love her?    Dose your heart and head Really mean it and coaberate such affection?    it will hurt horribly of course but do you still mean to stick by her and see this through ?       That is Love.     Be there for her, understand she might be afraid, might be having doubts in herself and might be listening to an unfriendly ear with good intentions.    Know that your love may suffer trials the likes youve never thought of.        But if its sopposed to be, then you will be.
fdBxaA4uaa	You're already exhibiting distrust in your partner by checking his phone without his permission. This trust issue will create future problems in your relationship - you can bet on it!  I would talk with you fiance about this and ask him why he gets so many late-night texts and from who, and ask if he MINDS if you take a peek just to "ease your mind" :)  Offer your phone to balance things out, and to show you have nothing to hide. If he objects, there may be a problem. Or maybe he just doesn't want his privacy invaded. Talking is the best method|`|7tLDdtqGaa	what Always On said - define 'not sexual but pretty close to it'|`|UXtvfXFgaa	WOW TALK TO HIM I HAVE HAD MY PHONE WENT THRU AND GOT IN IN FIGHTS OVER NOTHING TALK TO HIM FIRST IF U FEEL U HAVE TO DO THAT ALREADY UR IN TROUBLE|`|AA10647819	sounds like you don't trust him; probably with good reason.     you might want to rethink things, get to the bottom of it, ask him directly... before you're married and end up divorced b/c of infidelity.|`|afavjTDbaa	you should first approach her about the situation and then if it does not stop then u take the situation where u want it to go either  together or not|`|JBugDqvraa	You check your FIANCES texts? waw that's a great way to start a marriage. NO its not okay to do this you obviously don't trust him at all so why are you even with him?    What you can do is confront him. Tell him you've read his texts because you are a bit suspicious of the phone 'pinging' at all hours. Tell him you were so curious and are now a bit concerned. If he loves you and there is nothing in it he will forgive you for looking and call you a ninny-muggins and explain who the texts are from. If he starts yelling then, he may indeed be hiding something, or might be mad that you don't trust him.|`|5CcUuj0daa	well you guys are in this together, so flat out just ask him.|`|hAjLUKGRaa	hey girl! if he is your fiance you have the full rite to ask him bout those text messages nd you definitely should before you get married!!! my boyfriend gets texts all the time nd i sneak and check em just in case lol dont feel like ur the only one believe me if all girls were honest they would admit it too! anyways checkin the phone doesnt mean ya dont love him or trust him ur just curious nd he should never have a problemo with ur askin if they are anywhere close to sexual like you said i would definitley confront him maybe even jokingly because he might be innocent u kno give him the benefit of the doubt....nd if u really wanna b crazy call the numbers from a private number just to see if theyre girls because a fiance shouldnt b talkin to other girls durin the night anyway....good luck hope i helped!!|`|dBDnIuBqaa	I wouldn't confront him just yet, I would wait for the right text message, in the mean time keep checking them and  no it's not bad, you have to make sure this guy is worth saying "i do" for. So I would wait until a text comes in that crosses the line and confront him with it. The point is you have to get proof that he's doin somethin dirty, if not great, but if he is, ask yourself if your willing to deal with that for the REST of your life. If you are then you can't complain...so good luck!|`|wohGR1Nkaa	You should talk to him about it. Only 1 1/2 years isnt a long time to amount up in the trust you need.  So.  Ask him if he has like any regrets about getting engaged and if he loves you.   If he says hes fine with it then maybe say to him that you have been a tad concerned by the lateness of texts hes getting.  If he says its a friend then just say  could you ask them not to text to late please  if he says no then say well why not. whats there that cant be said then that couldnt be said in the morning.  After that just try make sence of things. if he still resits this then say you will get the number yourself and tell them to stop he should get the message.|`|hi1eqrXwaa	ask him about them. tell him if he reallty want to marry you then he needs to be up front and honest.|`|BUET39wmaa	ask him  tell him you are feeling a little insecure about all the chatting on his phone and if he can explain it to you???|`|SNaxiArHaa	Well if they are close to sexual then  you need to confront him and ask him whats going on and who it is and see if he will introduce them to you. No engaged man will have messages coming in at all hours of the night unless it could possibly be cheating|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Talk to your partner about this.|`|r8owV9esaa	confront him and dont get married o someone you cant trust!! omg get out of this fastt|`|DjircW6waa	Do NOT marry this guy.

But you don't want him to feel like you don't trust him.

Anyways all his things are part of yours after marriage.|`|Bu2asnXFaa	Well good relationships are built on trust and respect.  I don't know about the 2nd but you dont' seem to have the first.  something to think about.  If you're worried about these messages fess up on your snooping and talk to your fiance'.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	don't stalk him for one if you guys are getting ready to get married and you can't trust him then you need to reconsider getting married for a while|`|96zZlJVYaa	if you have to check his cell phone then you shouldn't be engage at all. sound like that the two of you were moving way too fast to be engage. sorry if you have to check his cell phone then you shouldn't be engage nor living together. that is the way I see it...|`|ymMa6Pmiaa	Confront him.  Talk about it as soon as possible before things get worse.  You'll gonna have more problems in your mariage life with this guy if you won't resolve that problem now.. .  And I think he doesn't deserve your love for hiding things from you. In love, there shoyuld be trust from one another. .    Have a good day!|`|zDqlHcGSaa	Grow up and get over your jealousy issues. BUT...........................if you happen to find out that he's been cheating on you all this time, bite his dick off. That'll teach him!!!!!!|`|OapbXepjaa	Describe some of the messages please.    I think that if you are going to get married you both need to have trust in each other but at the same point you should not have to search and find these things behind his back before he tells you about them.    Ask him why he gets texts at odd hours at night and who would be that rude as to text him at that time? If he lies to you about it, then you have some problems in your relationship and need to talk about them immediately.    If you bring it up now that you looked at his phone he will get angry so it is best to just start out by asking him what I wrote above.|`|HESpmdqAaa	if you even feel the ned to check his shyt then you dont need to be with him.....if you dont trust him leave....and if he dot give u a reason to trust him..leave|`|gqvvXknQaa	Confront him!

Dating 1 1/2 year isn't very long to be engaged imo. There has to be ultimate trust in this relationship, if its like this now, how will it be later on?   Think back about how he acts when other girls are around or if he goes out, don't be too nosey and don't follow him, cause that isn't cool.
UNspaI3vaa	WOW go get a new friend...but be nice...i mean also tell a counseler about the cuttin thing...thats wrong... and if she has to act like that around you to try to impress you then thats also wrong... k bye hope i helped
q8eue7CRaa	If someone is invited to the wedding, they could be invited to a shower. You can't have a shower and invite people and then not invite them to the wedding. If they have a shower, they can register somewhere if they want - you can put the store enclosure cards in the shower invitations.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  Here is what I think....    It IS acceptable to have a bridal shower IF those invited to the shower are also the "family and friends" that WILL BE invited to the ceremony.    It is not acceptable to invite those who will only be invited to the BBQ reception to the shower.  If you are invited to the shower, etiquette is that you must also be invited to the wedding (the ceremony.)    She can register (shower/reception), but it is only acceptable to put "the bride is registered at xxxx" in the shower invitations.....not in the wedding invitations and/or the reception invitations.    The invitation to the reception would be like this:    Sarah Jo Johnson  and  Brian Thomas Smith  invite you to celebrate with them  at a reception to honor their marriage  on Saturday, the xxx of xxx  beginning at six o'clock  at their home  111 Shoreline Drive  Tulsa, Oklahoma    Sarah and Brian were married in a   private ceremony on  [date]    If this is a casual type of thing....the invite can be made more casual.  There are lots of wording examples on the internet.|`|RmIeoU7raa	I'm only having a wedding with 7 people there.  My future mother-in-law and my mother had a shower for me.  I figured that if I wasn't going to have a wedding I might as well let them go all out on the shower.  lol   My fiance and I did register and it did help out a lot.  Since the reception is going to be more casual then make the invitations nice but casual.|`|itbkP9HGaa	Aren't all weddings private?  I've never heard of a wedding open to the general public!    From what I know of etiquette, if they aren't invited to the ceremony, its not polite to request gifts (which would be expected at a shower).  Most people will not show up empty-handed to the BBQ and will bring money or gift cards anyway, but that's the only acceptable way to do it...from what I know!  :)|`|cGtHHDg5aa	Invites for the reception could read something like:  "Please join us as we celebrate the recent marriage of Mr. and Mrs. John Doe.  Date  Time  Location:    Tradition states you only invite people to a bridal shower that are also invited to a wedding.  Chances are people will bring gifts to the reception. I don't see any problem with registering, just don't put registry info on the invites.    Have friends and family tell the other guests where the couple registered.  Best of luck and have fun!|`|ziZQWxi3aa	All you have to do is ask her, what she wants, so you know what steps you need to take on your part!  Don't be afraid to ask her!      There are a lot of websites with invitations, with different variety of invite styles..formal, classy, etc.    I'm glad that you are doing this for her, you really do seem like a great friend!

It would be so bright and I have a million ideas of what would look nice with linens, flowers, dresses etc.  Everything's goin through my head right now.  I think it would be amazing.|`|l43NSgHyaa	I wouldn't pick either.  I like pool blue, but not with mango orange.    I'm also not a fan of lime green and purples not my thing either.<br>  <br>  I would do pool blue with black or brown.|`|seU9VwIJaa	I know exactly what you're going through! I wanted deep purple and light light LIGHT gold for a winter wedding in Minneapolis...until everyone pointed out they were Vikings colors. (Which I don't agree with!) Now I'm having a color crisis!<br>  I love how bright your colors are! I love pool blue and mango orange personally. One of my friends did the color combo and I almost did it before I switched to a winter wedding. The dresses were fun and the colors fit the couple's personality perfectly!<br>  Go with what you want! If you are a bears fan, it would be a cute way to celebrate another thing you have in common as a couple if anyone points it out!<br>  Congrats on your big day!!|`|6UmRmaeWaa	I love the blue and mango how awesome!<br>  <br>  Ahhh 4get the cubs as long as your not advertising for them ha ha and I know you won't be I wouldn't think anything of it.<br>  <br>  We are in Nebraska and my colors are red and white and of course everyone thinks it's cause the darn Huskers. Def was not my intention but I am so happy with my colors!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|HJ0YTWjVaa	I am a fan of the pool blue and burnt orange. I totally do not the think that is anywhere close to the Bears colors. They are dark blue not pool. My advise is to pick one and stay with it. Don't look at anything else. I did that and kept changing!  You will always find something that may look better. Good luck!|`|sGP6s7uraa	I really, really, really like the amethyst and lime green.  I think it is a gorgeous color palette with great contrast betweent he dark and vibrant.  I would choose the amethyst and green.|`|JCAgvgTxaa	I vote for green and purple.<br>  <br>  For an example, check out Jon & Kate's cake here:<br>  <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/tv/jon-and-kate/wedding/reception.html" rel="nofollow">http://tlc.discovery.com/tv/jon-and-kate...</a>|`|q8eue7CRaa	The lime green might blend in too much with the garden, so I'd vote the contrasting colors.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	the extra green in a garden might be too much.  Everything would blend in unless that's what you want.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Pool Blue and Orange Sounds Cute!|`|5gtbGwMPaa	I think the Lime Green & Purple would be a beautiful combination.  You really don't see those colors at weddings.  It would definitely unique and colorful.   You'd also have a variety of options with flower combinations, invites, programs, table decorations etc.  Good Luck!!!!|`|Krs6O0T7aa	Hmm... Well I'm no expert in wedding stuff, but I'm naturally fond of lime green and purple. It'd probably be lilacs or violets on their stems if you choose that. My friend Saria once put those colors together in a picture, and they look pretty well together.|`|ogtHK7Eiaa	THE COOL BLUE AND MANGO ORANGE SOUNDS NICE <br>  ESPECIALLY FOR A GARDEN WEDDING IT SOUND KUTE <br>  DONT WORRY ABOUT WHAT OTHER THINK ITS ALL ABOUT U <br>  AT THE END OF THE DAY YOULL BE THE ONLY PERSON WHO WILL BE EFFECTED BY THIS WEDDING..... IF U LIKE IT THEN EVERYONE IS WILL BE ALL FOR IT|`|Em64TFqgaa	The pool blue is not even close to bears (go Pack by the way- =D)<br>  I think pool and orange sound beautiful.  People who are saying it sounds like the bears probably haven't seen "pool blue". Thy are just thinking Blue and Orange. Stick with it.|`|562qoBUUaa	I think your idea of a garden wedding is cute. I like the pool blue and orange better than the lime green and purple. I think it's classier. Nobody is really gonna think of the Bears when its all put together.|`|h3NJO9dWaa	I love purple, I think it will be one of my colors. I would choose the green and purple, but what about a softer green instead of lime? is it in the summer?|`|50ab85f362cbbddab47844295a4bba7caa	I like both color options. Really you could do purlpe, lime and orange. There is no rule to only having two colors and I think all three would look great in a garden.|`|xbzCxo8yaa	I love the lime green and purple color scheme................mine was Avacado green and Taupe.............outdoors also, it was really nice and different....|`|APgtCPzGaa	I would go with Lime Green and Purple. I make wedding cakes and this is one color combo I haven't seen before. <br>  I think it would be vibrant and unique and goes well with the garden theme.|`|hXCBJTAOaa	i like the lime green and purple, use the pool blue and mango in your flowers since it is a garden wedding|`|Qj4zN2C4aa	Lime green and mango?<br>  Pool blue and orange, cos it's your wedding and you should get to use the colour combos you want (:|`|lGobzFzeaa	We are having canary yellow with a splash of hot pink. It will be a july wedding.|`|xuiSfzgraa	I personally love the purple and lime green combo!|`|DYoyrsT3aa	i would say to go with the blue and purple combination.|`|1OujK62Vaa	blue and orabge so upbeat and flower pleaz
AA12144552	She is not bad on the eyes but the minute she opens her mouth to talk, I want to vomit, both from what she says and from the sound of her voice. I don't want vomit on myself, so overall i would say "no"|`|ifC1aFHxaa	I like her. I'd date her if I had the opportunity, I guess. I certainly think she's a lot smarter than she came across on camera. I believe she got "Quayled" in this election season.<br>  She'll prolly never recover her public image, but I can overlook that!|`|yYgsyopAaa	First, morons, Sarah Palin is NOT dumb. I don't get how people can call our elected officials "dumb"...I mean, WE elected them, if anyone is dumb, it's us.<br>  <br>  Second, the chick is hot. Get over it.|`|e5229cd398fab1a52d67a832b2db54c1aa	Sarah Who?<br>  <br>  You mean Joe the Plumber's sponsor?<br>  <br>  Personally, I am married, but if I wasn't, I wouldn't even give Sarah a second glance. <br>  <br>  Not my type at all!<br>  <br>  Too trashy!<br>  .|`|GiB2vZi0aa	I think she is attractive.I wouldnt date her as I already have a girl friend and wouldnt betray her for anyone.|`|ukf6hoqNaa	It takes all kinds!|`|4qT0TfMZaa	I'd sooner date a moose - yes, she's that dumb - and yes, quite a few men would have been dumb enough to vote for her because of her looks.  Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American male!|`|xGofrX5Iaa	Yes she is hot. She is in the very small group called G.I.L.F'S.
1l04qpOKaa	14 is way to young to be dating that age range! Jail bait. Her parents need to know about this, 14 is too young to date to begin with. Instead of ratting her out, find a way to let it slip to her parents. It's for her own good  :o)|`|vXa7IeDiaa	Yes, you should be worried.Older men can ta advantage of your friend.You need to tell her parents or if you meet any of the guys again..call the police.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	You might remind her that : 1. her parents can have the guy arrested for statutory rape even if they have never done anything . If she goes out of state with him , it can be filed as kidnapping even though he didn't and also he could go to prison if the parents push it . She is underage and he ( all of the ones you describe ) are of age , then it is a thing that could get the young man it trouble even though she does not do it.|`|Y1zH3Ecfaa	Yeah .... have you ever heard of the show to catch a predator .. go youtube it ! Im 22 and I cant see what someone my age would want with someone that young.... I mean you cant get drinks ..its illegal and its just bad news ... All these dudes what is sex .. tell her she is going to end up in a bad situation ..|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	I think I would warn the guys-she's jailbait till 18 and they could go to jail. Where are her parents? Such a dumb thing to do-|`|khFGiA1iaa	It depends. If she is just and I repeat JUST hanging out with them, it shouldn't be of much concern. On the other hand, if she is dating people that much older than her or having sex with them, you should definitely be worried. Not only is it illegal to date someone if you are over the age of 18 and they are under, but it's illegal to have sex with someone if they are under the age of 16 and you are over. If she's dating them, they could be looked at as a child predator even if they aren't having sex. If she's having sex with them, they could spend 20 years in jail minimum, have to pay a hefty fine, and have to register as a sex offender for the rest of their life. Meaning, they'd have to stay so far away from schools (so when they get older, they wouldn't be allowed to go on field trips with their kids, pick them up from school, etc.), and anybody that searched for a sex offender in their area would see his picture, name, what he did and how he paid for it, and where he lives. If she is dating or having sex with them, you need to talk to her. It's wrong and not healthy for her or the guys. She could ruin the guys' lives and get a bad name for herself. If she is JUST friends with them and they aren't doing anything illegal with her (buying her alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, having sex with her or dating her) then you should express your worries, but then leave them alone until something illegal starts occurring. It'd be awful if she developed a bad name for herself and got those guys in trouble... even if they are older and should know better. Talk to her! <br>  Hope I helped and good luck!<br>  <br>  Jessica|`|lcGriJXiaa	Certainly.  Any friend would be.  If her parents don't know this, then you need to have a chat with them.  If her parents don't care who she dates, then she is in more trouble than just dating older guys, and about all you can do is try to help her see what she is getting herself into. Don't be surprised, however, if she has to learn the hard way.  That's when she'll really need a friend.|`|BfmV2KpUaa	Make sure to point out to the guys over 18 she's dating, that she is only 14 years old, and if they so much as look at her in a lustful manner, they'll be reported as pedohpiles. That ought to put them off. She may be lying to them about her real age, so they need to know the truth before they get into real trouble. If that doesn't put them off, then by all means, tell her parents, and the cops.|`|rPZFgiwLaa	Yes, I would be worried.  I have more of a problem with the guy who dates a girl that young than your friend.  I think your friend is doing it just for the attention but the guy has something wrong with them when they "date" girls that much younger than them.<br>  PLUS, I don't know what state you live in, it's likely illegal.|`|HJrTuihcaa	first of all, that is illegal.<br>  second, that's her life, if she wants to ruin it and make bad choices, that's her problem, all you can do is try and talk her out of it but if you can't, just let her do it to herself. you tried and that's all you can do.|`|QaOj0nQLaa	I think you should tell her to be very careful. They may be taking advantage of her cause of her age and youth. She might think it's real fun but it can also very dangerous. My advice to you is to tell her just to be smart about her decisions.|`|0udjgaoBaa	She may have some underlining issues that she doesnt know how to deal with and she is seeking attention from guys....Keep being her friend if she needs you but dont go hang out with her when shes with these older guys...It will be a bad result|`|2g1LbQutaa	i agree. trust me my ex's best friend did that and became a complete whore who lost her virginity. my ex is still fine but thats only cuz i was able to help her thru it while we were still dating.|`|CUUjvakpaa	no just let her she is the one messing up|`|mLavBsJPaa	I think you should worry and be upset but at the end of the day it isn't your life like, just try and be happy for her, smile and be her friend. A while ago my friend JUST turned 14 and was dateing a dude who was almost 17.... that worried me. I really didn't get a good vibe you know? What i'm saying is at the moment she is just a teenager and should discover stuff on her own. Let her know that it's a bad idea but don't keeping telling her that. I'm sure she'll be fine and just be a good frined, all right?<br>  <br>  XXX<br>  God bless<br>  XXX|`|C7KzBGlDaa	I would be a little worried.<br>  Guys usually have one thing<br>  on mind, if anyone tells you different<br>  they are liein! And in that case, you know<br>  those guys can easily go to jail. She could<br>  still be starving for attention trying to impress<br>  and you know any older guy that goes after<br>  a 14 yearold is scum. Cause they should know<br>  their consequences. ? So talk to her<br>  let her know. Please, tell anyone that will listen!|`|LeIS45Ekaa	yes my best friend was like that she is 14 so am i all her life started to be was about guys and i finallly sent her a text about what i thought about it and told her that if she only thought about guys then i didnt think we should be friends any more after that she has a lot more respect for me and now she is with guys her own age.|`|OBPL49vWaa	honestly do not let her hang out with older guys like that.... i was that girl at 14 and i got my self into lots of trouble..even if you dont believe it shes probably drinking having sex and smoking pot, if not doing worse. ive been there and done that and with her being younger she feels more pressure to fit it.  You really need to keep and eye on her, and dont believe anythign she says|`|uYr3A1ZZaa	I feel yes.. you should be worried.. the mind set of a 19 year old is totally different compared to a 14 year old. A 14 year old is too young to be with 19 year old.. A 19 year old girl would be mature enough to hang around with guys older than her age.|`|Ysu6YDUsaa	You're not going to change her, and you can't control what she does, and if you're concerned you should confront her about it.<br>  <br>  And if she's ignoring you when you confront her, she isn't your friend.|`|7NtMbVCJaa	not really. I'm a lad and have a friend that does the same... tell the whole time they are taking advantage of her.... she neva listns and now she has the reputation of being a slut lol. so it's her choice if she wantsa at the end of the day... they rarely listen!|`|2WLkCu23aa	YES! You should be VERY worried!  Anyone 14 going out with a 18+ person is considered PEDOPHILE!  Call your friend's parents and even local police NOW if you have to!  This is very very scary!  I pray your friend will be OKAY!|`|o7JfhhLbaa	i dont think you should worry but if this guy makes her do things she dosent want to do i think you should talk to another friend.

Lol, maybe it could be your kids eating the chocolate and blaming your husband, at SOME times. It's not too much of a big deal, but just ask "can you please stop and least leave some chocolate for us?" lol, im sure it'd work and it is definately better than laughing.|`|8lDmtlOcaa	dude wth|`|WMR8hVlfaa	I... would hazard a guess that your husband likes chocolate. <br>  <br>  o_O<br>  <br>  Hopefully English is your second language, not your first.|`|AA11319441	I'm sorry, but this is the funniest Sh*t ever!|`|9yurQ85Eaa	LOL I'm sorry, but that is funny.

She is history repeating itself.  Focus on getting her to sort herself out rather than petty revenge on a girl who is no better off than her.<br>  <br>  Addicts are users.  Your cousin is no angel.  She will use you to get what she wants - I am speaking from experience here before you shoot me down in flames<br>  <br>  If your cousin wanted to sort out her life she would, I mean she has the support of her family etc.  Some people just don't want to sort their lives out|`|Eug52iQDaa	Simple.

As much as you care for her do not let a using drug addicted person live with you. Your children are at risk.

She hasn't been feeling well the last few days and has complained about how I haven't given her enough TLC.  This coming from the same woman who left me with our 3 year old twins for 12 hours when I was sick so she could go shopping with her mom and sisters a few weeks ago.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	yes my husband works in a high stress job and he is away from us quite a bit when he's home I want him to have a quiet peaceful resting place so I try my best to handle things myself and not worry him unless it's absolutely neccessary.|`|ymWkGqm7aa	No, if I wasn't happy for whatever reason, I would tell them.

I'm naturally sort of honest and moody, and my wife is a total happy faker, so she HATES it when I'm myself.  <br>  <br>  After 12 years of marriage, I consciously "act ok" at least 3-5 times a week.|`|WaIt54N9aa	Yeah.....i had to be that way around my soon to be ex-husband.  It is a very difficult thing because then you are not really happy with yourself.  Be careful not to lose yourself in the situation.|`|sVNWdW50aa	Of course. Why subject someone else you your foul mood if it isn't their fault and they can't do anything about it. Anyone who says they are always completely honest about their feelings is either lying or very cruel to others.|`|UKqJiIlGaa	yes, yes, yes<br>  <br>  but if you feel like you are always walking on eggshells, it could indicate an abusive/unhealthy relationship|`|6vZKp5XCaa	Yes, most of the time. Look at how many people said yes and how many said no.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Unfortunately YES!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Yes.  I think it happens with all married couples from time-to-time.|`|qeVqBMVraa	well everyone does that|`|189233d5651c6d19d5903bb45454ecd9aa	During our pre-marriage counseling, my husband and I ran across a really good piece of advice:<br>  <br>  "Often, LOVE means acting in a loving way even when you are not feeling in a loving mood."<br>  <br>  Now, remember:  this does NOT mean codependency, or putting up with bad, abusive, or unhealthy behaviors.  I'm talking about people who love each other and are otherwise normal.<br>  <br>  In those normal marriages, love must be a VERB, not a noun.  We must do things for each other, and sometimes we must do things we don't feel like doing!<br>  <br>  So, yes, I occasionally "fake" being happy.  But I would never pretend for long.  If something is not my husband's fault or responsibility, or if I'm still figuring out how I feel about a problem, I will hold off on making him deal with it.  That's love.  <br>  <br>  When I decide I need help, or when it's time for him to be a part of my problem, I will unload.  He will help.  Sometimes he may have to "fake" that he wants to help, but he will.  That's love.<br>  <br>  This should NOT happen often, and not for very long, but occasionally, yes, this is necessary.|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	**** upsetting them, if you're not happy being in a relationship with someone, you shouldn't be in it in the first place!!<br>  For one you're lying to yourself, for staying in it knowing that you wasn't!!!|`|lgBLl9gnaa	Every.

p75ZEmjXaa	No it's not fundamental.  Yes you are missing out.<br>  <br>  My wife is similar to you and she is scared to death of feeling anything personal.  She has no ability to feel herself.  It's really weird, and it's hard being the other person in that relationship.<br>  <br>  The thing with you and my wife is that you really don't want to change.  You're like winnie the pooh... easygoing but never really open.  People like you, and you'll hold their hand if they do the work, but in the end you'd rather eat honey or read a book in the tree.|`|5V2VClqQaa	You're a lucky person! You can be happy on your own. However, open your mind and see what life would offer to you. <br>  <br>  One of my female friend had always acted and dressed like a boy since she was young.

Having no friends is not healthy for anyone.|`|T272vObnaa	I think you have no desire to be in a relationship because you're scared of failure.  You're scared to try because you don't think you're good enough, and afraid to find out if it's true.  If you truly think you're happy, then you wouldn't be questioning life.  <br>  I don't like getting close to anyone either, I much prefer to be by myself.  My only friend is my husband, and it doesn't bother me.  I find my company most enjoyable and don't understand the social need of others.<br>  I do believe it is a human need to feel bonded to another, as much as I hate the idea.

So, the short answer to your question is:  yes and no.<br>  <br>  I have been in both camps.  I was very, very much alone for most of my life, but then slowly realized that I didn't want to be.  After traveling on my own, living on my own, and doing everything on my own until my mid-30s, one day I realized I was done.  Shortly after that, I met my wonderful husband.  Perhaps you just need to live more before you start looking to share your life.  And, above all, perhaps you just need to wait for the right person.<br>  <br>  Either way, don't compromise.

Don't feel like the runt or the one with the responsibilities.  Good ages would be [when I'm 17] for my siblings to be 19 and 13 or something like that so we don't have the same circle of friends.

AA11946390	Every guy (especially abusive men) start off really sweet and caring, but their true colors are shown later on. I'm not sure how long you two have been together but you should eliminate thoughts of marriage for now until you really get to know this dude. Does he blow up at other people, or just you? Are your fights about small things? <br>  Many people argue unfairly, and get pretty upset, but it doesn't necessarily make them abusive. If I were you, I would read up on warning signs of domestic violence and see if your bf fits that profile. There are many subtle things that you may have missed. Doing that should give you some insight on what your future may be like. Furthermore, tell him that they way that you two argue is unhealthy, and it bothers you. If he doesn't make a serious attempt to change his behavior for the benefit of the relationship, that will tell you that he either can't control or refuses to change his behavior, and this is a MAJOR problem and there won't be any other choice for you than to leave. Good luck.|`|TZpFcx47aa	Nothing to add. Just amen to all of the above. He is an abusive hot-head. Been there, seen that. It gets worse not better. ALWAYS.|`|tZkHHy5jaa	He's definately abusive.  If you decide to marry him, expect him to behave the way he's behaving now. He will not change for the better, instead since you consider marrying him accepting this problem, he will continue in this behavior, thinking its okay. If you're not happy now, how are you going to feel later when the wall punching turns into face punching?|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	Yes I've been there....sweetie, next thing he will try to get is your face. You need to get out of there. It always starts like this and it slowly escalates to physical violence...he won't be an exception. The military world has the highest domestic violence statistics.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Your boyfriend has anger management problems and poor conflict resolution skills...in laymen's terms he's a hothead.<br>  <br>  He needs anger management classes and trust me if you don't step up now and tell him you won't put up with it anymore than he will stop hitting walls and start pounding on you.
tRNiXtplaa	See if his actions match with his words. been in the same situation and he ended up quitting me|`|sCCjAKllaa	He seems too inconsistent.

b06d2752947c332133b3d703ba6e1c3faa	The whole registry thing seems to really get a rise out of a lot of people. Fact is, when people attend a wedding, they traditionally bring a gift. some of us prefer to bring a gift that you will actually need and therefore some of us appreciate knowing you're registered somewhere so we can just look it up and get the right thing. Others think it's insulting if the bride even hints at a registry. SO, you're kinda screwed either way.<br>  <br>  I am not putting anything about where we are registered in my own invites. Instead, I told my mom and MOH where we are registered. If anyone asks, they can tell them. I am also working on a wedding info site for us (perk of being a webdesigner with free space on my servers) and one of the menu links is RSVP/Registry. They can click on that to RSVP via a contact form, and it will also have a blurb about "Your presence at our wedding is the only present we need, however, after several have asked, we are registered at XX and XX."|`|AA11312653	It isn't mannerly to anticipate or expect gifts. People usually choose to give you a gift, but to tell them what sort of gift you'd like would be like demanding a gift and that looks greedy. This is why it's incorrect to even put "no gifts please" on your invitation. That implies that you COULD demand gifts if you wanted to, but are letting people off the hook as a special kindness. <br>  <br>  Way back in the 1900s we did our RSVPs via telephone. Family and attendants handled the calls, and callers would ask for hints on what to wear, driving directions, and what sort of gift the couple would like. THEN, if someone ASKS, it's OK to tell them.<br>  <br>  Your helpers should have a little speech prepared that offers people options. It would be rude to say only "They are registered at K-Mart" because that doesn't offer any options for people who don't like registries or who like to give cash. Something like "They both enjoy photography and travel, they're registered at K-Mart, and I'm sure they'd welcome contributions to the honeymoon fund" offers options for everyone. <br>  <br>  If you feel that you can't do RSVP by phone, then you find an excuse for your helpers to call everyone.|`|55zWUXcUaa	Nope you don't call anyone.  If someone calls and asks you then it's ok to tell them.  Etiquette wise the reason why you are not supposed to put registry info into the invitations is because it's almost like saying to your guests that the gift is almost like the price of admission.  So calling would be the same thing.  The polite way is to spread the word when people ask, the gift isn't supposed to be a requirement, but a nice gesture on your guests part.|`|T1qzML1Zaa	I agree completely with Annabell. Most out of state relatives (if they are attending the wedding) will probably just give you a card with money (less to carry). If they are not planning on attending they might not send anything at all or will just send you a gift card or money. Why are you even worried about it?|`|JtEBaOdjaa	People will ask.  Word gets around.  You can also set up a wedding webpage through theknot.com (or any other one you can find) It's easy to set up.  You can email the link to everyone and put the registry info on there.<br>  Don't worry, people expect you will register somewhere and they will ask.  Otherwise they'll probably just give you cash.|`|seU9VwIJaa	It is tacky to place a registry in the invitation. The cost to attend the wedding is not a gift. If you're not mailing a bridal shower invitation, put a link to your wedding website for fun information and add a link to where you're registered.|`|q8eue7CRaa	People will call your parents or just ask you where you registered at. If they want to know, they'll find out! You could also make one of those free wedding websites (weddingchannel.com) and maybe spread that word around - you can include the registry places on that website.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I'll just preface this by saying, it's your wedding and you should do whatever you think is appropriate.  However, it almost every etiquette book I've ever read it clearly says you should not put any registry information in print AT ALL on any invitation to either engagement parties, bridal showers, or wedding invitations.  Registry information is to be spread by word of mouth by the wedding party and your family.  By putting this information in print and "suggesting" it to your guests... you are basically directing your guests to purchase wedding gifts for you.  That's the thought behind why it's rude.  How we handled this was by including our wedding website on the save the dates.  Our free wedding website includes stories, pictures, a page with pictures of our wedding parties, a page for hotel accomodations, and a page with our wedding registry information.  I think that's borderline tacky, but not as overt as including registry information in with invitations.<br>  <br>  Under no circumstances should you tell anyone where you are registered unless they ask you.  You should not be calling anyone and volunteering this information.  If people want to know... they will ask you, your family or your wedding party.|`|xuiSfzgraa	Word of mouth through family and friends will get the word out.  If people want to get you a gift and want to know where you are registered, they will ask.  You can always invite out of state people to your shower.  Even if they can't make it they might like getting the invite as to not feel left out.  Then they would receive your registry information in the shower invite, and who knows, maybe even send a shower gift as well.|`|AA11065140	No, YOU are not to call anyone.  The guests will call someone who knows where you're registered - your mother, your MIL, your bridesmaids, for example.  It's also possible that your guests will call you to ask, and at that point, it would be appropriate for you to direct them to your registry.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that if a guest sends you a gift, it's because they want to...not just because they've been invited.  When they are interested enough to ask for input, that's when they'll get it.  Otherwise, the topic should not be discussed.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	It's sort of a sticky thing.. most people want to know where you're registered, and you want them to know, but by putting the info in the invite or calling them, some people may thing that you are just trying to wrangle in the gifts.  It's not a requirement for people to buy you anything and if they do, it doesn't have to be off the registry.  That being said, there are several ways to let people know.  Word of mouth is usually pretty effective.  Don't call people and tell them yourself, but let your parents and a few close friends know that you want to get the word out.  You might want to consider setting up a (free) wedding website on Theknot.com or e-wedding.com.  You can put registry info and links to your registry.  Then you can include the website address in the invite and people can look for themselves.  You'll have lots of other info on there so people wont' think it's all about the gifts.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	The reason you can't put it in the invites is because it's very rude to ASK for gifts.  People give you things because they want to.  If they want to get you a gift they usually call you or your parents to ask where you're registered.  You're not supposed to call people up and put them on the spot like that.|`|50ab85f362cbbddab47844295a4bba7caa	You never put your registry in anything. You can put "registered at..." in the shower invite, but that is it. You do not call people. Most people will assume you are registered somewhere and either ask around until they find out or just take a guess and go to a store they think you might be.|`|bKK2fPiVaa	Wow... I put registry cards in my invites.  No one complained.  Yes, it's wrong to expect gifts, but on the other hand, it's nice to give something to someone that I know they would use.  I recieved things on my registry and I use them... no one wasted money on gifts that we couldn't use or had no desire to use.  My sister, on the other hand, got some hideous wedding gifts!|`|m0WUEtqXaa	Well in my neighborhood we include it.I did and it just makes things so much easier so that you don't have to call people and give the MOH a bit of a break. Its not offensive at all! but then again my neighborhood is in Africa and this could be MUCH different for you guys .|`|VhHVjMe8aa	If those people that can't attend want to buy you a gift they will call and ask where you are registered. It's just bad manners to put the registry in the wedding invite.|`|Wdl9SA9jaa	You can list it on the bridal shower invite or your wedding website but not on the actual wedding invite. Hope that helps =]  Happy Planning!|`|GAmlREmsaa	Some places (Macy's, BedBathBeyond, Crate & Barrel) give you little cards to insert into your invite packet now.  I am considering that route.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Generally the registry information is included int he shower invitation because that's when people buy off the registry.  For the wedding, guests typically opt for a monetary gift.  If they want the registry information they ask either you or someone in your family where you are registered.  No, you do not call people and tell them where you are registered.  If they ask, of course, you can tell them.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Are you sending out save-the-dates?<br>  <br>  I plan on sticking them in there...  I know at least one shower will be thrown but it might not include my whole family...  So, to be on the safe side and to notify all my guests, that's what I'll be doing.<br>  <br>  Word of mouth is also a great way...  Either send out a max email, or tell your parents to spread the word to family.  <br>  <br>  If guests don't know, they usually will either give cash/check or they will ask... :)|`|l43NSgHyaa	For those that aren't attending the shower, they have a variety of ways to find out this information.  One, they can ask someone who attended the shower.  Two, they can call up a mutual friend or family member.  Three, they can call you can ask.<br>  <br>  You'd be surprised by the amount of people who will call and ask.  It's not rude for them to call you and inquire about where you're registered. So, if they call, you can tell them.  But, it's rude for you to make courtesy calls to them, letting you know where you're registered.<br>  <br>  Trust me, if people want to buy you a registry item, they'll find out.   But, more than likely, people will just give you cash at the wedding.  That's not such a bad thing either.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Technically, it's bad etiquette to include registry info in your invites. The way to do it in good taste is to wait for people to ask, then tell them; set up a wedding website that includes the info, and put the link on your invites; and spread the info by word of mouth (through your MOH, best man, parents, etc). Typically, when people get a wedding invitation, they will figure out how to ask about your registry or gift preference; they will either contact you, or someone they know from your wedding party or your family.|`|4POGapREaa	Why are you SO concerned about everyone getting your info for what presents you want?  You simply do not include that information.  And no you don't call them either.  That would be even worse.  If they CHOOSE to buy you something, they will call and ask where you are registered or what you would prefer as a gift.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	The information is spread via word of mouth. You give the information to your parents and bridal party and they tell anyone who asks them. Most people know to ask the parents or attendants.

She will make it go snap, crackle and pop from then on!|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	There is something clearly bothering her and she has deliberately distanced herself from you, this requires serious counseling to find out what is wrong and also to rule out any physical cause.|`|B12E4rYiaa	If you are going to counseling and it isn't helping you need a new counselor and 3 months is not enough time to get rid of a lifetime of issues which could have occurred on her end or yours.<br>  <br>  Seek new counsel and stick with it don't stop going until you find one that actually helps. Saving the marriage is worth all the effort.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	I have no idea.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Does she rave-on endlessly about your skills as a lover?  If not, maybe (just maybe) you need to look in the mirror.  Try romancing her; drag her off to a motel for a whirlwind sex-marathon.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	My gosh this is my life down to the ages. My second wife was exactly like this for 3 years. Wouldn't do a thing about it. I begged and pleaded to no avail. Finally after 12 years with the kids at ages 8 and 10 we parted ways. A few months later she did have to have a hysterectomy. The doctors said at that time it was most likely caused by her hormones. She was 36 at the time. Too much damage had been caused between us though and we never got back together. We have remained friends and she and my current wife are very good friends. Get her to the doctor. Don't take no for an answer. Sadly I did. Good luck to you.|`|W5wCArLqaa	you know I would relate to you but my husband is not all perfect. When we got married. I wanted sex 24/7. but now it is down to once a week or 2 weeks. I stopped asking him for sex. I give him pleasure whenever he wants. Sometimes I even do it cuzz i want to get somehting but I think sex is boring for him. He stay at home. Cleans every now and then. I work fulltime and just started part time. I cook and clean. even after that I want to have sex so I can feel good. But I guess I need a toy. There were times that he got soft in the middle. I feel so bad. I wish my husband was like that. He just cares for his own pleasure. <br>  <br>  Sex therapy is the option. read articles online and show her. There is online support out there for women. It looks like that she is stressed out about somehthing. Usually after kids the sex drive goes down but not like that. She may need to start working out or something to get her hormones back. Is she taking any birth controls. Some birth controls kills the sex hormones. You should check into that. Let me know I am a good researcher.|`|mCM363I9aa	you can't have it all.<br>  <br>  I am the opposite, I will hardly clean but I'm always available for sex.<br>  I'm working on it, yesterday I made a home cooked lasagna. ok you just reminded me, i'm getting off the computer and start cleaning.|`|5ca74cb9e6d3604c2c41d86d59b901beaa	try some foreplay some oral for her ,amybe that will loosen her up|`|DzAFT8VDaa	OY! You have made tremendous strides in trying to accommodate her when it comes to sex. IMHO she avoids sex because sex is about losing control and that is uncomfortable for her. Organizing and lists are things she can control. The pleasure you give her during sex is something she can't and she doesn't like giving herself up to something.<br>  <br>  You are going to get more and more resentful and end up either having an affair or sleeping around, if she doesn't truly understand the damage she is doing to you and your relationship, your family.<br>  <br>  If you didn't want/need sex, of course, this wouldn't be an issue. Unfortunately, I can only suggest more counseling, but from a sex therapist. This is a specifically acute problem that needs specialized treatment.<br>  <br>  Good luck. You sound like a really great guy.|`|Yleae8hiaa	Sounds like something she can control. Something is definitely going on with her. She probably needs to find help. And it sounds like you are a great guy,so your support will be needed. Maybe in the bedroom she feels like she can't control things, but she sure can control her family life and that is what she seems to focus on. <br>  I would say you two need to see a sex therapist, but she also needs to see a therapist alone. Good luck|`|bqkfu6Diaa	She is avoiding sex and deep down inside she knows she is. She is causing herself to become so busy with other responsibilities that she ends up being too tired or not having enough time for sex. This is how she can excuse or rationalize living a sexless life. You would rather her drop some of the chores and instead enjoy some sex, which makes perfect sense. But in her mind, these other things are so terribly important, that she cannot step away from them for any reason (actually she will step away for many reasons, but not for sex). There is something deeper. There is something going on that is causing her to avoid it. Maybe she lost her sex drive and feels inadequate. Maybe she feels like she will not be satisfied or will not satisfy you. Maybe she doesn't feel sexy enough. The number of possibilities is endless, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  She needs you to sit her down and explain to her that sex is an important part of your relationship that cannot be put aside. She needs you to explain that if your relationship is not sexually satisfying within reason that it cannot and will not last. She needs you to explain to her that being perfect in all other areas of life cannot and will not make up for the lack of sex in your relationship. She needs to understand that if she cannot motivate herself on her own to increase her sexual activity that she needs to seek outside assistance. She needs to understand that it's not something she can think about and get around to tomorrow. She needs to act on it today because it is that important. Of course you cannot expect a 180 change over night. But you can at least expect to see a reasonable amount of effort on her part. If she cannot do that, there is no meal good enough or no laundry clean enough that can compensate for a dead sex life in a marriage. It just won't happen. And kudos to you for recognizing and praising her for all of her other accomplishments.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Are you a good lover to her, or do you treat her like a porn star? Maybe the problem is you. Give me a thumbs down if you like but I can't imagine continually refusing mind blowing sex. It's your responsibility to make it feel irresistable.|`|mMBzpldbaa	i don't know what to tell you to do... i'm the exact opposite. i'm totally disorganised, hate cleaning (it's a treat for my boyfriend when i do a big clean) but will drop anything and everything for sex. i'm a total nympho! cooking's fun when you do it together but apart? not fun! <br>  <br>  try coming home from work one day and saying, "drop everything, i've arranged a babysitter, go get dressed, we're going out for dinner tonight and i've booked a hotel." get her tipsy and bonk her =]<br>  <br>  <br>  that's what i'd do in your situation... but i don't understand women who don't love sex. it's a dealbreaker for me!|`|E1vyiNYKaa	maybe her sex drive is down. or she is not getting moist anymore. it is sometime hard to tell somebody your sex drive is gone. she might need to go to obgyn or take her to sex shop plan something special for her|`|AA10097443	I know.... MORE GEL...LOL :D|`|2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	I got some ideas.<br>  <br>  1. romance her, do the corny rose pedals and candles in the bedroom thing.<br>  2. you take the reigns for a day. take the kids to your moms house so you have the day alone. order out and get some wine in her.<br>  3. treat her like your girlfriend. fondle and kiss as necessary. sweep her off her feet and take her to the bedroom.<br>  4.  buy her some sex toys.more specifically a vibrator. not trying to be mean or demeaning but if she hasn't gotten hers in a while it may not be your fault but she still needs that spark quick.<br>  How about brushing the teeth right before your gonna try to make out with her. splash some cologn on.<br>  5. Offer her a massage.. " baby you look stressed out get your butt in that room so I can give you a massage"  carry her if you have to. <br>  <br>  <br>  I assure you one of these will lead to more action. use it every day of the week if you have to. but the old..- gee im horny can i have some- routine will not work. believe me.|`|8GfEEzzhaa	From what you say I think she at least cares about you and the kids, and loves you very much. The problem with her libido though makes it though on you. I think it is wrong that you blame it on her though. Losing once libido is NOT one's fault, it depends on chemicals released in the body. the fact that these are not there (thus her low libido) might be due to a number of things. And, don't for a second think she is enjoying this low libido. Of course she doesn't complain from it, because this is how her body makes her feel. But that doesn't necessarily mean this is HER, or that god forbid she is doing it on purpose. Actually I think that her organizing is due to her subconsciously feeling something is missing in her life, so she tried to fill it in.<br>  <br>  What I suggest you do is first realize that this is not her fault and that she is not doing it on purpose. You need to sit down and apologize for your pestering. You need to explain to her that you've understood that the lack of sex is a mutual problem that you face together. <br>  You could do research on your own about reasons of low libido. The mother of a friend of mine reached menopause at 40. <br>  You could suggest she gets to the doctor (if she agrees, offer to go with her!). Yet, make sure you don;t phrase it in a way that suggests that you think something is wrong with her. It is very sensitive issue. Just think how you would feel if she suggested you are impotent. Act very delicately.|`|O8TA4tMGaa	My first question to you is:<br>  How long has this been going on?  <br>  <br>  You've been married for 12 years. You have two children, 8 and 10, so you had to have had sex at some point.  Was she a sex maniac in the beginning and it dwindled after the kids?  Was she always hard pressed to have sex but at least you got it some of the time?  What's her pattern been?<br>  <br>  The biggest mistake a couple can make is going into a marriage knowing the partner's sexual pattern (some people are once a day type people and others a once a month type people) thinking that marriage is going to change that.  <br>  <br>  Why does your wife not like sex?  It's clear to  me that she doesn't like it enough to make time for it.  Rule #1: We always make time for the things that are important to us.  It's clear that sex is not at the top of her priority list.<br>  <br>  It's also clear that she doesn't understand what sex means to you.  If you sit down with someone and you say, "Sex is important to me.  If we don't have intimacy on a regular basis, a part of the relationship is dead to me and I don't know how long I can be here in this relationship with you if that happens", you've now created a sense of urgency because, whether you want to admit it or not, it's true.  <br>  <br>  Do not fool yourself into believing that her being a good wife and mother is enough to keep a whole relationship in tact.  Contrary to popular belief, it's not.  Men understand intimacy as a woman accepting them, allowing them in, making them feel wanted.  If a man doesn't feel wanted, after a while, you can do everything else right, it will not be enough to keep him.  That's fact.<br>  <br>  Have you told her how big a deal this is?<br>  <br>  Again, I'm going right back to Maya Angelou: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them."  And I'm not talking about your wife here.  You know who she is.  I'm talking about you.  Are you showing her how important this is to you, how much of a dealbreaker this is, how on the line your marriage is because of this?  <br>  <br>  I don't get the sense that you are.  I see that she's overcompensating in other areas because she knows she's not pleasing you sexually but does she understand that if this doesn't get resolved, trouble lies ahead?<br>  <br>  Maybe it's time you got that point across clearly.
EKp4Cg0vaa	I love the colors for your wedding. They are the same as mine along with a chocolate brown. just go one question. How subdued is the lilac color? If it stands out too much, it might look odd. (If you can really see the color from 15 feet away, it's not subdued.) If it is, why no add small touches of lilac everywhere?|`|If6O5XHlaa	Don't let him pick the one with the lilac swirls if the theme is pink and silver. He should wear either ivory to match you or pink or silver, the lilac would just look a bit out of place.  I have told my husband to be exactly what to wear and I have bought his tie for him.  <br>  <br>  Stick to the theme, it is nice to have the groom in a different colour to everyone else, so he can be distinguished as the groom. I would put him in a pink waistcoat (if he doesn't have a problem with wearing pink) and have everyone else in ivory.|`|RAatxTeSaa	iTS YOUR WEDDiNG... JUST DO WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY...

Not lilac.  There's no lilac in your wedding.  The guys should be in pink and if they refuse pink, they should go with a silver.  Dad's should be in black as well as ushers.|`|afI03mJXaa	I would keep everything the same. With my wedding the color we chose was champagne. So the bridesmaids dresses are champagne and the groomsmen will wear champagne waistcoats with white shirts and black tuxes. I would think it would be too much color, but that is my opinion. It is your wedding and it is whatever makes you happy. Good Luck.|`|8355f1836f81573668040890f1ec8c77aa	I did matching things.<br>  Grey suits for me, the best man, the ushers, etc.<br>  <br>  We looked like a pop group out of the 70's<br>  <br>  Daft but good looking.<br>  <br>  Trouble is someone, and I think I know who, wrote "SH" on the sole of the new lft shoe, and "IT" on the right one.<br>  <br>  Great kneeling at the alter !<br>  Thanks for that photo !<br>  It was a posh do, but not without humour.<br>  <br>  Carnations a plenty, but some had minor explosives hidden<br>  <br>  No damage done, but surely a wedding should be fun.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bob|`|c861d0f74c3120fdb6e80e0d25b8afb0aa	I don't think you should mix white and ivory together - makes the ivory look dull.  Blue/lilac/silver all go well but I don't think you should have too many colours going on as it looks a bit disorganised.|`|AA11312653	IMO, fancifully colored men's formal wear is for chorus boys, bartenders, and very young gentlement attending their first prom.
lHc6lgF0aa	probably.... I know this sounds awful, but I feel really bad and I have learned.<br>  <br>  I'm 17. Last fall, I stole $100 dollars from my sister's hard-earned summer job money to buy marijuana and LSD... But a few days later someone jacked the weed and then I had the worst trip of my life on the LSD I bought.<br>  My sister still thinks that our Dad stole her money.<br>  Sis, I'm so sorry. :'(|`|lBZkXzr0aa	Well I know someone who is having an affair and I haven't said anything.

Mine is a pretty big secret about myself which I can't get the strength inside to tell anyone. Not even my closest friends. Because I'd be scared I'd lose people. Maybe one day I will get to the point where I have to tell people to live happily. But I'm only 15, so it's tricky at the moment. Many people would dislike me anyway, and I'd lose so many people probably. I haven't told you what it is. But you can guess ;)|`|8l4y6gxlaa	My big secret is me being scared. Have you ever really thought about what is going to happen to you when you die. I have, and every night that thought keeps popping into my head. I am really scared. I know that you are suppose to go to heaven and all that, but really come on... what happens. You don't live a life anymore, you don't have anywhere to go. It's like I don't know how to explain it. It is weird. But do you get what I mean?? I know this is a weird secret but it is one. I hope I helped.|`|DLAkIHsDaa	Ok Ok  everybody I am now going to tell a very very top & personal secret to u all but please do not make this a public secret, becos it deals with my personal life and the secret is I am a very good boy, .|`|hl00mjtoaa	I'm in love with my second husband from which I am presently seperated from and currently am living with my first ex-hubby.|`|JeREolT6aa	My best friend has been asked for pictures and also my uncle has a daughter that he thinks is his but is actually another mans|`|snWybep8aa	Im not really sure.

9fc6963cbdae594803724cff5fd4fb54aa	its hard cause he could just be trying to be nice, but if he goes over the friendship line, then you should definetly say something or hint things to him that you like him back. but be careful not to jump into things too quickly. if he really does just want to be friends, it will be hard to go back to being just friends if you say something to him.|`|5aXKo6uCaa	get to know him better|`|rvCbwX1Paa	If he acts like he likes you, he probably does.

Instead of having that chance,but people just keep coming out of nowhere. Which is stopping from telling how he feels about you.<br>  <br>  P.S. Keep this thing going that you to are doing,but try to meet up somewhere that you two will know that no one want interfered with you two trying to reach out with each other.<br>  Good Luck I hope I help!!!!!!!!!|`|YI3WLPAhaa	Talk to him more.

e8Nz2jiraa	He came across it. He didn't contact you even though he knows you would be up for it. He isn't thinking about you anymore. Maybe he was curious to what it said because he has dated you before but thats all. If  he wanted you he would contact you. You need to wake up and realize you are worth more than some man who was cheating on you. He broke up with you because he didn't want to be with you. You didn't do anything wrong. You just wanted to know why he was so busy with this co worker. A person who has nothing to hide hides nothing. You deserve better than that and you are old enough that you should know your worth.|`|R4P0QuYRaa	maybe you should start takling back to him. god as put him back on your mind for some reason so just try it<br>  <br>  good luck|`|4P7N6XULaa	If he wanted to start dating you again he would have got in touch and asked you.

It doesn't mean anything else.  I have googled ex-boyfriends just for fun and in NO WAY have any interest in them.  If he was interested in you don't you think he would have sent you a message through the dating service?  He didn't care enough to do it which means that he isn't interested.  If he is let him contact you.  Besides, you have already gone down that road and it wasn't a perfect situation.  Try a new road and find someone better.|`|p7Z5H8ftaa	maybe he was just curious ever think of that? if you ask why then youll come off as wierd, trust me. Instead message him being like whats up its been a while how are you. then maybe later you can be like "well id noticed you looked at my profile and iv been mising you alittle bit.."|`|BrSDvWacaa	If you're over 30 and you have problems with a boyfriend who texts other women, you deserve to be left out in the cold.  At your ages, neither of you likely to make a long-term commitment to anyone...ever!  <br>  <br>  Now you can't get out of your head the fact that he checked out your profile?  Why wouldn't he?  He's out there playing the field, and you're on it.  Get in the game, if you want in.  If not, take a shower.
bBxz2UAwaa	Wow thats crazy, why wouldnt you want kids there? Thats kinda weird. But if so then someone needs to tell them. I mean thats not fair she cant find a sitter, i dont think you should not invit them just because of that reason, why dont you talk to her about this more. If she is a family friend and you want to get back involved with your family and friends then there is no reason she shouldnt be welcome just like everyone else. Sorry but your Girl sounds very stuck up and rude!|`|kbz5S3waaa	it's your and your wife's wedding - no one else'ss. Who cares is the parent that you don't really like anyway isdisappointedd that HER friend can't come - is this your parents friend's wedding? No! Family is obviously important to your wife, just respect that.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	You're not going to like my answer, but hopefully you will see that I am speaking from the heart and honestly trying to help you here......<br>  <br>  MAN UP AND STOP BEING SUCH A BYTCH!  You need to TAKE CHARGE and TELL people how this is going to be!  This is YOUR wedding not theirs, and your future wife needs you to be the last word on the matter.  If you don't want kids at the wedding then DON'T HAVE KIDS AT THE WEDDING!  And if somebody doesn't like it, then tough shyt!  If your parents think they can dictate how the wedding is planned because they're contributing 40% to it, then tell them to keep their 40% and do what YOU wanted to do to begin with.   <br>  <br>  How you spend the rest of your marriage is being decided right now as we speak.  You are establishing a pattern of how things will be.  Do you want your wife thinking that you would rather run and hide and avoid life's issues like your family?  Do you really want to force your wife to call your friends parents and be the problem solver?  Or are you willing to deal with these sorts of things LIKE A MAN head on, and by taking charge?  <br>  <br>  Seriously bro, you need to make a decision and STICK TO IT.  Do what's best for you and your wife.  And show her that you are the MAN who can make decisions, stick to them, and not waffle or waiver.  That you are NOT going to force her to deal with sticky situations because again, YOU ARE THE MAN!  Ultimately she will have tons of respect for you.  And you'll have a lot more respect for you too.  Remember brudda........BE THE MAN!|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You should have done what you thought was right but since you didn't and she persuaded you to get in touch she can't start moaning about it now. Tell her you will decide the best way to deal with this from now on.|`|3iNobwVraa	Well, there is a nicer way to say this, and don't be too quick to make this about your longstanding issues with your parents either, because I am almost positive that anyone who has planned a wedding has faced this question.  Seriously.  It's ridiculously common.  I guarantee all the etiquette gurus have addressed how to handle this many times.<br>  <br>  Look up some of these, or have best man or maid of honor give them a phone call (someone with some social graces) and explain:  "Hi, I'm _____, so and so's maid of honor.  I am trying to help her handle some of the important details, and was asked to touch base with you directly about the babysitting situation because ______ and their family really want you to be able to attend.  Since the wedding is 'adults only,' I was wondering if you would be interested in sharing a sitter with another family?  I would be more than happy to try to help coordinate this, because ______ wants to make sure you have everything you need to be able to come enjoy yourself.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help you with this, or if you have any questions.  I have been asked to make myself available to you, and I am happy to do so."<br>  <br>  Some version of this would probably smooth the waters because the extra effort and attention of having someone reach out specifically to help them will make them feel special enough that it limits the *what?! they don't want our kids?!?!?* factor.<br>  <br>  Weddings are tricky, and already so stressful/emotional.  Usually I say to just say things directly, and respectfully, but were weddings are concerned, it really pays to go the extra mile and smooth all the feathers you can.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	Getting in touch with your parents was the right thing to do.....letting them financially provide for the wedding and asking them to provide a list of guests was a mistake.<br>  <br>  You should have prepared the list yourself, paid for the wedding yourself and then you manage it the way you want. If you're big enough to get by without your family around then you're big enough to pay 100% of your wedding. <br>  <br>  Now it's too late so you have to deal with it the best you can....let people bring their kids, problem solved. Learn the lesson. When you have children remember....call your parents, invite them to the christening but <do not> involve them in the managing or the financing of it.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Well you can't unscramble eggs. Yes, you know your family better than she does. You knew they would cause trouble. Now she knows. Don't blame her for that. You are rude to not include children in the wedding celebration. It is so tacky to have "adults only." You should invite the family and leave it up to them if they will bring their kids or not. So far 100% of the time I get a sitter for weddings. If your wife calls and un-invites her she is even more tacky. <br>  <br>  I feel you should blow it all off and elope. Cancel the wedding plans and elope. Throw the reception and let everyone bring kids or whatever.|`|msGQPrrjaa	Sorry far your less than stellar childhood.If you like the guest let her bring her kid if she can't find a sitter.I presume there will be alcohol served.Good luck!|`|189233d5651c6d19d5903bb45454ecd9aa	I completely understand your predicament.  I have a similar relationship with some of my family, and we had a similar situation at our wedding.  <br>  <br>  You're really asking two questions here:<br>  <br>  1)  should you discontinue your relationship with your parents?  Probably.  If it's as bad as you say, and if you feel you have made the decision carefully, then yes.  Let them go.<br>  <br>  2)  what about right now?  The reception, and the kids?  <br>  OK, first of all, there is nothing wrong with asking people not to bring their children.  We had to have the same rule, and it is NOT rude.  Most people understand.  Here's how to handle this:<br>               a. if necessary, you can compromise and say "only children under 3."  The trick here is to blame the CATERER.  Most will charge an older child as a "person."  that way people who have nursing babies or other difficulties will feel accommodated, and parents with older kids will understand the distinction without feeling slighted.<br>               b.  do not be mortified if your wife wants to call these people and tell them not to bring their kids.  it would be better if someone else made the phone call, however.  do you have an aunt or other relative (on your side of the family) who understands your plight?  This kind of news is usually better coming from them.<br>  <br>  The main thing is to get through the reception, now that you've opened that can of worms.  After that, you can cut your family loose.  Hopefully, your wife is now realizing how problematic it is to deal with your family, and she will not ask you to include them in future.  If she doesn't understand, you just have to stand firm.  For your own sanity, you have to choose your own happiness above all.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|93ix6nyvaa	It's definitely too late to turn things around at this point, and your wife isn't being very reasonable she does decide to call this friend of your parents'. Just lay out the problem: why do we not want children at this reception? and what would be the pros/cons of having children there? is it really that big of a deal to have just a few kids at the reception? Reason it out with you wife and try to convince her that it's gonna be a happy day. Don't let little things as these ruin it.|`|APmRrekkaa	Glad you are back talking with your family.<br>  <br>  Why are you mortified with your fiance. Who's wedding is it?<br>  This is your wedding and if people can not respect your wishes then oh well. it's not about them, it's you two being happy. You only get one!<br>  People will try to walk over what you say.. Stick to your plans, and it seems like this is what your fiance is doing... so y are you mad with her.... <br>   <br>  If your mother friend really wants to attend, then she will find a babysitter. Stand on what you say; No Kids!|`|Yby3loNEaa	well i know one way to answer this, tell her that she was the one that insisted on having your family, even though you told her that you didn't want them there, and plus why would anyone want a wedding with out children????? i love going to wedding when you can have kids there they make it great, i feel bad for you but it is her big day and sometime so people get a little crazy but i really think you need to sit down and talk to each other before she calls this poor family and make her selk look little a stuck up b**ch|`|emKXU1QFaa	Sounds like you need to start cutting them out of your life again and let your wife know told you so. lol <br>  <br>  Anyway, if children were asked not to be there then yes, someone preferably your parents needs to tell that person they can't come.  If children do show up everyone else will get a little miffed at why they couldn't bring kids.  If your family will not call then you need to get in touch with them not your wife and simple let them know there was a misunderstanding and you are sorry but children are not allowed.|`|r59SRbKIaa	Is this reception about YOU and YOUR WIFE or is it about your parents?<br>  <br>  Decide what's important. If I need to spell it out, that is who you are spending your life with, not who you grew up with.<br>  <br>  I agree with you. Getting together with your family was probably a big mistake, it sounds like they have only brought chaos to your life. Family can be selfish and disruptive.<br>  <br>  Don't be mortified. Respect your wife's wishes. You set up rules, and your parents want to break them "because we're your parents." That is selfish and controlling on their part.<br>  <br>  Remember, it's about YOU and YOUR WIFE, not them. Take a stand!|`|MyhGTTwHaa	What's wrong with having small children at a wedding? Kinda sounds selfish.  I wouldn't blame your parents for it, you should have give them a limit on how many guests considering how much they helped pay for it also since they kept adding people.|`|RgNUsKfxaa	well its your big day not your parents or any one elses so you decide who goes and who doesnt.<br>  <br>  personally i think its selfish to bann children from going after all are the children going to take the limelight of you.|`|N5v2j6hPaa	Im sorry I agree with your wife. <br>  <br>  I would get in touch with this person and explain that there will be drinking and its not a suitable environment for children and Im glad that you understand.  The next time we have a bbQ/etc with kids you will be the first on the invite...<br>  <br>  .....whats the worst that can happen your parents get mad....(you didnt want to contact them anyway)|`|YMxuenU7aa	Families are messy and hard and dysfunctional.  Yes life would sometimes be easier without them, but they are your family.  However, you are an adult and it's up to you how much you want to allow them into your life.  Having said that - have you parents be the ones to tell them that the reception will not be kid friendly and it would be best to leave young ones at home in the care of others, or to stay at home with them. They are your parents friends after all, and would probably be best coming from them.  Was this info about no children stated on the invitations?  If not, that might have been smarter - then you would have no issues.  So maybe it doesn't have much to do with how you are in contact with your family, but how you are handling your own choices??
xieiM0FRaa	Just tell her that you can't afford it. She is being VERY unreasonable, considering you're going to have to pay for a baby soon, you out of a job and she's trying to get you to sped hundreds of dollars on HER wedding. Tell her that you'll get your hair done where you can afford it, you'll pick you'll provide your own dress or SHE can pay for everything she insists you buy. If she can't take either of those options, tell her you're not going to the wedding. Do not waste your money on a hairstyle your mom can do for free, do not waste it on a mani you can do yourself, and do not waste on a dress that makes you look ridiculous and you'll only wear one time. You're not in a position where you can afford to do that, especially being pregnant.|`|5gtbGwMPaa	She's being unreasonable.  Yes this is her day however, she needs to understand that many of her brides maids can't afford what she's asking.  Maybe she needs to pay for the extras such as jewelry hair do's & what ever else she has planned.|`|bKK2fPiVaa	Good luck!  This bridesmaid stuff is for the birds!  You shell out the money on the dress, hair, nails, gifts, parties and so much more!  And the bride never recognizes what you do becuase she is so wrapped up in everything else.<br>  I am going through something similiar.  How can someone ask you to pay nearly $200 on a dress you will wear ONCE, plus the other expenses knowing you can't afford it.  It seems selfish of your sister.  I hope you can explain it all to her.|`|dTBBihxQaa	WOW.. you need to sit down and have a talk with her and tell you her that you want her to have a nice wedding but you don't need to spend all that money. I just recently got married and was able to do so on a budget.It was a nice.. I did everything that i wanted to do for my big day..If she is willing to understand then good, if not tell her that you can't afford to pay for all the expensive items and hair do's (especially if your mom can do for free) then you will have to back out and not be able to be in the wedding..|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Well, here's the thing.  She can't "make" you get anything.  Tell her what you need to to keep her quiet and just do what you want with your hair, toenails, etc.  On Sunday, what will she do, not allow you to be part of the day, I would guess not.  But, if she does, you at least have things done as you would wish.<br>  <br>  I don't understand brides that control everything!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	your problem is you didn't realize how much this was going to cost months ago.  I've been in 4 weddings and the cost probably totals more than my car is worth.  you should have backed out months ago.  if she means what she says, that the jewelry and whatnot is mandatory, then tell her you can't afford it and refuse to pay when she knows you're unemployed and preggers, and just put on a regular dress and go sunday as a guest.  her loss.  your gain because you won't have to spend a ton of money on an ingrateful sister.  sell your dress on ebay and be rid of it, have your mom do your hair for free so you look and feel nice, but don't spend any $$ that you don't have to.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	Tell her she either gives you a break with the money situation, or she can find someone else to take your place. That is why they started to call people Bridezillas because they gave no thought to anyone else and just are in it for their own selfish gain. If your mom can do the same hairstyle as the salon can, why does it matter so much to her??|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Tell her you are 8 months pregnant, broke, and if she insists on this, you will back out because you need every penny you can get your hands on for this child. No ifs, ands, or buts.|`|cGbTJobeaa	And she is exactly why some women are called bridezillas.  Matching toe nails and flip flops???  She's getting caught up on the appearance of her bridesmaids feet? And 9 bridesmaids??<br>  <br>  Wowie kazowie!|`|8c7cc680a9dfdc46cf7a06e1622558bbaa	Sounds like you have a bridezilla on your hands lol. How very annoying.<br>  <br>  I agree with the other poster that said she can't MAKE YOU do anything. <br>  <br>  I would just straight up tell her that you simply cannot afford all her "demands" especially with a baby on the way. I would just try to reason with her. How silly of her...especially while some of you don't have jobs. I am so glad I won't be like that for my wedding. I am pretty much letting my bridesmaids pick the dress they want to wear...what flatters THEM. I want them to enjoy themselves, be comfortable and have fun!<br>  <br>  And just as a side note I really dislike David's Bridal alterations department. I bought my wedding dress there and when they altered it the sleeves looked totally different than what they were supposed to look like. The woman made them look puffy like I was in the freakin' 80's. I probably wouldn't mind getting another dress there but there is no way I would ever let them alter another dress.
IJXy9ZuRaa	Im not a man..but im gonna give u a females point of view....you cant get over someone you care about in hours, days etc. This all takes time. You can go out and meet people, go out and have a good time and just go from there. Dont be like most guys and just go out to find a "lay", have more respect for others than that. If it happens it happens, but dont just go out to get laid. When you do that you sometimes miss out on some pretty special women. Just saying that thats my point of view.<br>  Michelle|`|OAYaeW22aa	dont go to a *** ok|`|a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	what was the point of this?|`|sCCjAKllaa	Call another girl over, get wasted, and pwn her for a good while until I'm tired.

Either she likes to experiment or she doesn't.  You can't narrow it down by ethnic group.  Just make sure before you say "i do", she has the same wants/desires in the bedroom.  Then you'll be happy. That's all I can tell you.|`|Q49EEdzbaa	The other people are right. race doesnt matter when women have sex we try to please our man more than we do ourselves. so we get on it and ride it like a horse; but on the other hand we like to be licked all over especially you know where so which race is better on that level?HUH???????????????????|`|4RgXh3ftaa	Thats a retarted question.. depends on the PERSON, not race, religion, age, short, tall, fat, thin, it's the person period.|`|Ih18jMNyaa	Nothing to do with group/race but everything to do with attitude!<br>  <br>  Find a woman with a great sexual attitude and you are set for life!|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I have had many different women from different backgrounds and races.<br>  There is no best or worst.

You should tell her to stop acting like that, and make it clear to her that it's bothering you. And if she won't cut it out, then don't go with her anywhere anymore, because "sorry, but you make me feel ashamed I have a sister".

I really like White girls a whole lot, now, and it's just because I do, with no real reason to it. If both look to do the same, though, I don't see why one is better then the other. That just seems odd to me.|`|McJ18CN0aa	It's the same for me. But it's normal and black guys are more prone to wanting to f*** rather than talk.

rvCbwX1Paa	i've been in the exact same position. My boyfriend i have known for 7 months now and for the first four months of us knowing eachother he was with this girl who treated him like **** and eventually be broke up with her for me but for the longest time i felt like he would never love me as much as he did her. I think it was just because i listened to how much he cared for her before me and him had something. The important thing is to ACCEPT that that is his PAST you are his PRESENT. The only thing that helped me get over it is that he can't help that thats the situation he was in when we met, and he's with me now. and thats whats important. Good Luck : )|`|LKFqR3zZaa	it's completely normal everyone gets a little jealous in their life...you'll just have to learn to live with his flaws or tell him what's actually bothering you instead of yelling...everyone has a past and sometimes they aren't always the best. But if you truly love him you will learn to get over it and if he truly loves you he won't talk to them.|`|YKCIubvKaa	Everyone gets jealous. There are some things in your past that I'm sure he would get jealous over. And you have to keep that in mind. As you get jealous over something he probably gets jealous over something else. Its always going to be in the back of your mind I'm sure but you just do your best to move on. And remember (repeat it in your head) he gets jealous about you too.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	it's normal for a jealous person<br>  you should really forge about it because it is the past and look forward<br>  <br>  he is with you now and you guys can do whatever you want. why bother with the past, it's not like he was with you when he did those things|`|eTBfsjCUaa	I used to be a little like you but you have to think, that was before he really knew you and loved you. I doubt he does that now.<br>  Haven't you had sex or even dated other people? <br>  Just try not to think about it and focus on what yall have now.<br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|13b04ed9f4bea5d86d3c03ebc05b3123aa	I would not trust him. You have never met him. I mean come on.|`|UKqJiIlGaa	try to let it go and live in the moment|`|e41155eb2c2190ace8c054c07a220d07aa	Yep, you're jealous.  It kinda sucks that he leads you to be angry and jealous by telling you those things about his ex.  That is such a douche bag move.  It's like he is trying to push your buttons on purpose and I think it's because he knows he will get that kind of reaction from you.  I had a boyfriend that I had jealousy issues with too.  We talked about it and I said I would work on it.  Then if I was ever put into that sort of situation I would just try to stay calm and not let it bother me.  I ended up getting a more positive response from him afterwards.  Maybe your boy is just testing you.  Or maybe he's just a jerk.  And you need to realize that the past is done and gone and there are things that both of you have done that you may not like about eachother, but that will never change.  Let it go.  Easier said than done.  I know, but you have to try or else, eventually, no matter what you think, your jealousy could push him away.  Just try to stay cool.|`|e8Nz2jiraa	I think you should leave him alone about the past and stop being jealous. You are jealous because you don't know your personal self worth. You need to define what you deserve and what you don't. When you figure out what you are worth you will understand if you should take the actions you are taking. He is being honest with you of you keep getting mad when he tells you the truth he is just gonna start lying and if you don't think you deserve the truths that he is telling you leave him.|`|kp3JRi72aa	To me it sounds like you're a very insecure person.  You know that when he was with his ex girl, hes was goin behind her back and talking to you.  So why wouldnt he do that to you?  Good reason to feel that way.  Honestly, it will probably happen.  As far as getting mad at his past...thats not what your mad about.  You need him to need you, and the fact that he needed someone else in his life (besides u)  makes you jealous.  Truth is...you cant make someone love you more than they do.  Just cause you yell at him about him and other females.  Doesnt change a thing.  If you wants something or someone else. Nothing you do or say can stop that.  Sooo that being said.  Dont get bent out of shape.  Just be you, go with the flow, and hope for the best.  Thats really all you can do|`|K3XJ4S0Eaa	i wouldnt trust this, u havent even meet him!|`|7vt21U1naa	Yes it is pretty normal but he needs to learn how to let go of stuff. He needs to stop talking to you about his ex girlfriends. Your his girlfriend and he should give all his attention to you not some stupid ex. Just tell him to stop talking about his ex's do you talk to him about your ex's if yes then you need to stop too if you want things to get straight. If not then just simply tell him you don't want to hear him talking about his ex's you don't talk to him about your ex's so he should give you the same respect as you give him.<br>  =]|`|TWzOmqqYaa	You have a strong reason of being jealous. For what he is still doing, I don't see how you should be with him. Get this:<br>  "he's had this one girlfriend whom he used to always talk about to me. Well after awhile he fell for me, so he broke up with her"<br>  <br>  Don't you think that this "one girlfriend"  can be you? There is a very high chance. Think again.|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	your not mature enough to enter a rea relationship right now....If a guy was talking to you while dating someone else and fell for you, that should tell you his character.  He'll do the same thing to you.|`|8aa5f85b4dd536239b8ade249d0de719aa	You have isssuuues.|`|222c3710b1c82cfb0a40a144369157a8aa	Sounds normal to me.|`|p7Z5H8ftaa	yeah normally guys dont like girls who have done dirty stuff with other guys, its just wierd. same goes for you. You have to let his past go and try not to freak out on him so much. Instead give him a chance to say the right thing but if he says the wron thing then you can flip. just basically yeah forget about the past cuz holding onto its just gonna make you look stupid and screw up your relationship|`|KupUCZhiaa	listen, stop dating online, those relationships never go anywhere, dump his cyber ***, and get a real boyfriend, chances are, he still has that same girlfriend, never dumped her so that he could have two romances without having to worry about keeping you two apart...|`|sCCjAKllaa	It's normal, but you have to let it go after a while. He's your bf now, not hers, so I don't see why you'll constantly bring it up. Just focus on the present, not the past; that's how relationships get ruined.|`|gELUbPnAaa	trust me hun, he will leave you if you keep up these antics. get over it, he's with you now for a reason.|`|Zjjl7hrOaa	dont get mad cuz he talkin to his ex gf bf.if he dumped his ex gf 4 u wat do u expect?<br>  <br>  have u guys even met?|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Yes|`|msIrxkExaa	no|`|OAYaeW22aa	you are a little jealous i think but u r right to b tho.
kU5Xv2i2aa	He stands closer to you because he likes you. The close proximity and lack of others around you lets you feel his energy. He either sounds creepy or intense. I either sound crazy or make sense.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	If he sits that close to you & not shy around you, I would def. think he is trying to get your attention!  Seems to me that he likes you too.  As for being nervous, that is a common thing for many people when they like someone regardless if they are normally shy or outgoing.  Alcohol can relax someone but you don't wanna go that route unless ya'll are in a club or something.  I do hear that tea can be relaxing.  Chocolate always makes me feel better. Good Luck!|`|NviCwaroaa	Yes that is normal, have you notice that your playing with your hair too? That is a sure sign you like him. <br>  The thing I am concerned about is that he is shy with you around his friends, sounds like that's his game.You see you are young and guys do not want to let other girls know that they are with other girls. So just be careful, I see a game and a player in him.|`|NBMqCkHQaa	I know that sounds lame and I 'm sure you heard that a thousand times but just go for it you have to gain self-confidence. Why don't you get a knew haircut,new clothes just a new you  ask your friend they'll help you^^|`|vVLK3EXkaa	Over time you'll relax and know each other. You're not close friends, which is why you're both nervous still. Eventually the being nervous will wear down.|`|eEbqfYUTaa	drink chamomile tea for nervousness|`|s8yCwPedaa	Re-up on your meds|`|jp8RS6OAaa	i do the same thing he does with all my friends that are girls. if you have fun around him then you'll probly loosen up|`|uCapduHuaa	i think a get what your saying like me and this girl were the same way. when we were alone things were perfect; but when we got out in public we put our guards up. its retarded it leads to the worst kind of stuff. you need to just relax and realize he's going to think he's out of your league if you can't even talk to him when you guys are alone lol just sac up and connect with him. **** it lol|`|gvWLgYx4aa	Honestly, if I knew how to speak to the opposite sex I would tell you my secret, but sadly I have just about as much trouble as you do.|`|dixO8N8kaa	it's a natural reaction from your body. it seems pretty obvious he likes you too. ask him for coffee. find a way to be alone with him more often. the more you get to know him the more normal you will act around him.<br>  <br>  I still get butterflies when i see my bf walk into the room and it's been over a year. but they're good butterflies.|`|CpNVSJpmaa	He stands close to you because he likes you , it makes your conversations feel more private . <br>  Take a deep breath , it's normal to get a little nervous when close to someone you really like. You could even tell him in a light hearted way that you get all tongue tied when he's around. <br>  I bet he'll appreciate your honesty and find it cute as well.|`|TBZK5q78aa	Just tell they guy he is evading your proximity. There's nothing worst than to infringe someones personal space. Say it tactfully though. Think about what you are going to say before talking or otherwise your words will come out unclear and you may babble over words because your brain is trying to process a word but nothing has been processed. Take a deep breathe, have faith in God, and talk to him like a normal person. Be yourself dear. You'll be okay!   =)<br>  <br>  <br>  God-bless!|`|WI1Mz9YTaa	when you find the answer to that question, let me know :).<br>  It's hard being a girl! I guess you just have to always remember all your qualities and how great you are, and he's the one who should be wanting you and not vice versa.|`|RNCaCR2caa	Well your are experiencing your selfconsciousness. Just make him feel embarrassed right along with you. Also try breathing in real deep 20 times before you go talk to him.
VelE30y7aa	Well, my son blushed when you answered his question, know I'll answer yours. <br>  <br>  First off you have to think and consider the fact that your Best Friend is lying to his/her own mother, and your the one apologizing for things?  So you acted childish once, big deal. You apologized and you shouldn't let some old hag with a grudge hold you back. Stay friends with your friend.<br>  <br>  But greatly consider the fact that your friend lies to his/her mother just for her to be angry at you. Hm, makes you think a little bit there doesn't it?|`|KaQ2h8LOaa	maybe u should tell carlas mom that u havent done why are you lying about me and you should talk to your BFFs mom to telling her that you havent done drugs or tell ur mom to speak ur BFFs mom<br>  hope ive helped
f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Well if Marissa is the one you like you should go for her.  Peoples feelings will get hurt but you have to be true to the feelings you have too.|`|vXa7IeDiaa	OMGSH!!! boy u need to do some homework or play a sport to get ur mind of girls..lol..But I think you shouldn't even mess with Kenzie..Because it will make u look like a jerk to Jasmine..And it would make Kenzie look like a hoe and a bad friend for even trying to mess with her friends ex's..Kenzie should know better..Its like a girl code you don't mess with your friends ex's or bf's..And you should just forget about marissa..She's too far..and their are plenty of fish out there..|`|tO8ey3o8aa	tell kenzie the truth, that you really don't see a future with her<br>  and give yourself some time to get over jasmine so that you can pursue a future relationship with someone|`|9sHJz788aa	Ok don't date either of them. Jasmine still likes you she just doesnt want to get hurt. She's probably been hurt before and she doesnt want that to happen again. Just give it time and see what happens.Sit her down and talk to her,tell her whats goin on and if u still like Jasmine then tell her how much u care and dont give up, keep ur chin up hun!|`|JQZzI49Paa	She probally used that as a sorry *** excuse to dump you. B/c if a girl likes you, then they will fight over you with some *****|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	i think thats really fckkd wut your doing to Jasmine.  Im 14 too..<br>  and even tho you like kenzie you should just wait and see wut happens .<br>  good luck!|`|IP4ym3Ynaa	she lives far away? hmmm that can have some benefits... im kidding. what you should do is forget jasmine. shes being an over controlling bit i mean girl... and kenzi is the root of all this dilema. so go with marissa|`|bmi4Xlbfaa	Seriously, I was so confused reading that. I think that's a sign that you should cool it with the girl drama. Be single for a while, you're only fourteen.|`|0qg1Ste0aa	Life is rough, kid.|`|tq6fCjy1aa	Make the distance work|`|5JEYrUuTaa	dont date either of them. besides, youre 14. you still have highschool to date and stuff. dont worry about it|`|ER94paD2aa	I think you should go for a new chick.it solves the problem|`|Dk8ro0a1aa	Dude, out of all the girls you mentioned here, do you realize when you talk about Jasmine, you sound like you care for her the most? Get back with and stay Jasmine if you can. It would be unfair to be with any of the other girls, while your heart is somewhere else. (With Jasmine!). But if Jasmine still rejects you because of trust issues, then except that, whether the reason is true or not as you said. Let her go, its obvious she doesn't deserve an awesome guy like yourself. Don't sit around and mope, go ahead then date the others. But let them know you are trying to get over Jasmine. Continue to be honest just like you've always been and see how good everything turns out.     TT|`|wjmABX9Xaa	Ok look mann you have got to stop doing stuff like that-For instinct you was with a girl for 4 months you say right now what im going to say to you is appreciate the girl that loves or like you for you-see what im saying and your not over.<br>  In you say you don't want to hurt kenzie and you like marissa.<br>  Now kenzie is like every girl who is nice an everything,but you got to face the fact there is no connection between the two of you.So just easily break it down to her in tell her that you two isn't going to work and don't worry she'll get over it.<br>  In marissa you say you really like her,but do you know that she likes you back. I mean think about she could have a bf of her own also,but you and I don't know I'm just saying that from the top of my head.<br>  So, I guarantee that jasmine likes,but she don't understand, how are going to be with someone in then look at her friends like you want to be with them.<br>  <br>  P.s. good luck N make the right choose.<br>  I hope you get back with jasmine N let marissa go.|`|8HQLhCI0aa	you are still going to hurt her so choose who you like try to explain it to her in the best way it always better to forward to a girl then keeping her waiting ..well u can drive but i am pretty sure that u guys will find a way to see each other if u guys like each other ,, <br>  best luck .=)<br>  look for ur happiness not others ..|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Wow.  Sounds like you're in a dilemma.  Your ex had the right instinct to think you liked other girls.  So maybe ya'lls relationship was not that serious.  So then you have Kenzi & Marissa who you like, but Marissa the most.  Marissa would be a long distance relationship which would be extremely difficult b/c you don't have a car= hardly ever seeing her.  Kenzi sounds like someone you could become really good friends with no matter what.  Try to just be friends & see where that takes you.  You don't want to lose all your friends, but keep your options open cus you're young & single.  Good Luck!|`|p9Ku6RKOaa	here's the thing...you're not ready for another relationship. If you date kenzie, jasmine will hate you and jasmine and kenzie will most likely not be friends anymore. so you'd be a punk to do that. Marissa...dudeyou are 14! you are too young to be worrying about stuff like this!|`|lpaUM0ceaa	You have to make the distances work! Whichever girl u like better, you should stick with her (if they accuse you of cheating, then just tell the truth!)|`|JcV2nn4jaa	you are too young to be stress over this kind of stuff, go play hoops with your friend or something|`|sylXsNX7aa	dating-<a href="http://loverdate.org" rel="nofollow">http://loverdate.org</a>|`|0AeLcoe7aa	Wow, if you are really not over Jasmine then I would try to work things out with her first. If she doesn't want to then I would go out with the girl you like the most.|`|uCapduHuaa	go with your heart dude. it can't lead you wrong. its when your head ***** with your heart that things get screwed up lol|`|eEbqfYUTaa	hey youre still young finish your school first.think your future dont ruin others lives|`|6Bh32zqFaa	okay i am a mom of a 14 year old son as well. it looks like you have alot on ur plate for a young man.  First of you need to close your old chapters in your life in order to open up a new one. you really need to ask yourself which one os the best for you and who makes you happy. and you also need to be comfortable with that one girl. you like too many girls because they are all different, best Solution stay by yourself for a while and then see what happens. its normal to feel the way you do. my son had different girlfriends too and too many at that so he decided to stay by himself and play xbox that is his new girlfriend.....lol best of luck|`|8l4y6gxlaa	woah woah slow down there buddy! haha! It sounds like you have quite the love life going for you. Haha! well I guess that you could tell jasmine what happened. It doesnt sound like you can hurt her feelings anymore and it doesn't sound like you like her that much. I am 14 too and I totally get how you feel. I am in the same situation but I am not that into a guy right now. I would tall marissa that you like her and maybe talk to her a little bit first because you never know. And as for kenzie.. well I would let her down easy. You don't want to hurt her feelings. And if things don't go right with marissa and jasmine finds out that you don't like Kenzie... then maybe she will take you back if you want her back!<br>  Hope I helped<br>  Good luck with this situation!
AA11452969	u need to stop fixin it! all u need to do it to fix urself! not him or ur situation rightnow. the more u try to fix it the more it will get worst. if u want things to be ok and back to normal then stop what u r doing rightnow!!! stop being needy and controlling. no guy will like and appreciate this kind of behaviour! And the more u will try to talk them out the more they will get frustrated and mad at you! so all u need to do is to stop and give him space. give him the right to go on his cave. when he comes back dont try to talk him out it means he is good. so dont ruined it again. and if i were u dont change who u was when he met and fell for u. stay as u are. independent, fun, and charming!!!|`|OBPL49vWaa	honestly i would just let him be mad and sweat it out if i were you. go do something with your friends to get your mind off of him for a little while. it sounds like the kid might need some space for a little bit, so before he totally breaks up with you i would give him a day or two, to just hang out and do what he wants with out having you calling to check up on him every 20 min.|`|HPtpfqFJaa	Please learn how to spell.<br>  <br>  Just ignore him now, then he will come back to you, leave him alone or you will be considered a stalker and he'll never talk to you again.

b513111aa3d16b8c4e5fd1ed4f27c4b0aa	I would date the nerd, but cheat on her with the slut.  I would leave the athlete alone cuz she's a lesbo, unless she wants to 3 way with the slut.|`|ff545BLyaa	The athlete (I am very athletic)  Good thing the real world after high school is free of cliques... God I am glad i am done with high school.|`|196b73911133c4d75053bfa6ae887857aa	I've dated all of those!! They were all fun but I think I would have to say either the nerd or the athlete for me because I like someone smart but also someone who is active, the slut can't be trusted so she is out of being considered for anything serious, she would be more for casual dates.|`|13LutlWBaa	depends.  def not the slut, the nerd if she was hot (which somehow i doubt she would be) and the athlete if she was hot (and a good personality).|`|q0H3St1Oaa	Athlete.<br>  <br>  Nice slim body...;)|`|JCdBSULraa	nerd|`|yKK7ez7vaa	the girl to use many more time to sex|`|Dt3t6KwHaa	personally, the nerd, but that's only because my experience tells me that the slut is diseased, the athlete is shallow, and the nerd(with a little help) can be hotter than the other two put together!|`|jvWGnq6Laa	the nerd, they're usually the nicest and cutest|`|YI3WLPAhaa	So those are the only three types of girls, huh?

P1KbWHImaa	maybe he wanted to know what you really thought or feel. what you say to others that maybe you wont/cant say to him.  He sounds desperate. I wouldn't look at this in a negative way.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	Sounds to me like you definately should NOT divorce.  Look at the details here... you guys are talking.  He cares enough to snoop.  <br>  <br>  I've had trouble with my wife and our relationship for YEARS and I couldn't get her to care about my YA answers if I tried.  She'd just go to bed and forget about it.<br>  <br>  You're actually lucky.  Do not divorce this guy.<br>  <br>  Why don't you start emailing each other?  You could talk & vent a lot without having the personal confrontations.|`|AA11460234	Your paranoid.<br>  <br>  Hey...you asked. I mean....he quoted an answer you gave and after that "I immediately changed my profile".<br>  <br>  Does that sound like something someone would do whose NOT paranoid?|`|8aa5f85b4dd536239b8ade249d0de719aa	Seriously?<br>  Sue Yahoo! answers if you douchebags get divorced.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	He did invade your privacy.Me and my husband have an understanding.He stays out of my purse and I don't touch his wallet.That's just one example of the mutual respect you have to have with a spouse.It's none of his business what you say to other people,that's just flat nosy unless he's looking for something that would indicate you're cheating on him.Is that the case?Is he looking for dirt?If you don't have trust in a marriage it won't work.Trust is a required ingredient of a lasting relationship.Maybe he's worried about you talking about him specifically to people on the computer.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Sounds like he is the one paranoid. He needs to worry about his own state of mind and what his second wife is going to be like. You two need time apart if he's doing that you can be assured he's doing other things you just havent found out about yet. Dont divorce just yet but take time away from each other to find some peace and let things settle.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	I agree with the person who said he sounded desperate. I think he wanted to know what you truly thought and felt. I have a feeling he wasn't happy with what he read and thats why he quoted you. I'm not saying what he did was right.. but I think he was freaked out and needed to do something.. and thats what happened.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	It's time to move on. He will continue to berate you. Divorce, you can't trust him.|`|ZQE61wUZaa	For real?|`|WDs4fRoxaa	It sounds like he is using your words against you.<br>  <br>  I would delete and questions and answers and hope<br>  that he has not printed them.<br>  <br>  Then delete the history, cookies, and browser before<br>  you log off.<br>  <br>  Defrag computer.<br>  <br>  Change your password <br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	What does he think this is, a dating site? Jeeze, I'm on here HOURS every day, and my hubby could care less.<br>   I think yours is a jealous, snooping, control freak. I'd dump him if I were you.
AA11312653	Instead of an impersonal commerically printed announcement, it would be much more gracious to send people short personal hand written letters or notes. Like thank you notes, they need only be 2-4 sentences each, so you should be able to dash off 20 or 30 an hour and get this task done in an afternoon. Mail them all at the same time.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Yeah, that's just a little too late for wedding announcements.  I would give them a call to see how they are doing and tell them the news.|`|EKp4Cg0vaa	You have up to nine months to put an announcement in newspapers.|`|cgQqHJtKaa	It is too late, because if you didn't do it already, why bother  now?
xbzCxo8yaa	I would call a News Station to bring attention to this situation..........as a mother, if she neglected or abused her children that's different, but still warrants a reason and investigation..............to hang up the phone on distaught parents, is totally inconsiderate and unprofessional......<br>  <br>  Call a News Station to bring attention to this matter in hopes of getting some answers and getting to the bottom of the situation, that's if the parents have nothing to hide.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	You should contact a manager in the department and mention the criminal history.
dcBCCbalaa	If she has the Wii, maybe something like Mario Super Smash Brothers (I don't know the rating though...I own it and it's really not that violent) or MarioKart or Zelda for the Wii.  My cousin who's actually a boy really likes video games, and from knowing a lot of kids that age, girls really like video games too.  Maybe something like a sports equiptment package would be good too, like somehting with a football, volleyball, net, basketball and other stuff in it.  They're surprisingly cheap at places like Target and WalMart, but still worthwhile.  Good luck! :)|`|CMC9VVMqaa	karate lessons, rollerblades, those shoes with wheels on the heals, sunglasses, favorite team hat, a bike, a soccerball or maby some model cars she could put together|`|0kIwehVbaa	if you get her something as simple as a gift card to either a video game store a sporting goods store you know she will use it and she can get something she likes.|`|B4kf9jDGaa	get her guy's pants.|`|IP2suWFTaa	Find out who her favorite foot ball team is and get her something that has to do with the team.You can also find out what kind of music she likes to listen to and get her a CD of her favorite band.|`|DNCpCjqjaa	Is there a football team she likes? You could always get her a football jersey or sweatshirt of her favorite team....or maybe something for her wii...like a football game or something...or a giftcard to walmart or a store that she likes so she can get whatever she wants!

Don't make mountains out of molehills. if he gets uncomfortable with you hugging him or gets paranoid that you are trying to hit on him then he's a crappy friend.|`|QTgm2ZTvaa	ahhm he appreciates what i did? or just trying to say thank you LOL<br>  <br>  or maybe he likes me hahaha XD|`|ey8aWCPUaa	My female friends hug me all the time...<br>  <br>  And they know I hate it.

p7Z5H8ftaa	State a situation in your mind before you act on it. John is in the hospital and Im doing everything I can to help him can be the same as "john is in the hospital and I stole his phone and am calling everyone he knows to tell them and contantly here and not giving him his rest"<br>  <br>  just basically try to make sure your not annoying someone. and just so you know its annoying to ask if your being annoying. so just if you feel like your being annoying state the situation. <br>  "john is with his buddies and I wanna ask if I can go over but i wanna let him have his guy time but idk if he even cares" is as easily solved as "hey john, can i come over or are you having guy time?" just make sure you ask peoples preferences|`|utGddhnVaa	just don't make your bf do everything that you want to do. let him have his time and time with his friends. guys like that|`|TX5uV9bIaa	You need to be able to set boundaries and stick to them.  Without them you can take abuse and disrespect, which mean that you will continue to receive it.<br>  <br>  If you don't start with the sense of your own worth, that you are a person deserving of love and respect, then you subordinate your own standing to the person you are in love with...and you need them to love you as a way of meeting your needs...hence "needy".<br>  <br>  There is sort of a "law" of attraction that will bring you people who are users and who are not potential partners for that kind of un-equal relation.|`|rvCbwX1Paa	I have the same problem and what i do is i tell my boyfriend how i'm feeling in a casual way. when he tells me he was talking to this chick all class i just tell him "it always makes me jealous when you talk about spending time with other girls" and i laugh about it. You have to be confident that he wont leave you.|`|sCBJHVtzaa	Well love is one of the better things in life, and the more you get the more you want it's just natural, but try to balance your relationship life with your friends and school/work and once you have those balanced (most important comes first) it will all seem fine.|`|msGQPrrjaa	Depending on your persomnality you may never be able to.|`|g1OoQPraaa	I wouldn't worry so much about how you come across to others.  People will see you through their own filters.  One person could see you as needy, and another person doesn't see that at all.  It really depends more on them than on you, and if someone calls you needy, that is just their opinion or interpretation but its not necessarily true or false.  And you could do your very best to be the 'opposite' of what you perceive as a 'needy' person and make no impact on how they see you because it was their problem all along and had nothing to do with you.  Just be yourself.  Some will like it, some won't.  Thats life.|`|9aBKmhbZaa	just show your love less and care less about what they do... you don't want to become a person on the side that they know you will always be there for them when they screw up...

Honestly child....<br>  If someone makes fun of you it means that they have no brain.<br>  Thirteen year olds....|`|IWO1GTpGaa	Well of course they are highly immature and it isn't that they do not like you they think you are an easy target.  An easy target meaning they feel that in some cases you are a nerd, geek, punk, etc.  Well apparently you showed Kyle that you aren't a punk and he somewhat backed off when you punched him in his face.  I am not saying you should do to all of the guys because one of them just might hit you back.  You can either change for a couple of morons you do not like or you can stay your same self and when provoke take action.|`|Y7NpmZxMaa	nahh they just don't know how to flirt with a girl and that's just their way of flirting don't worry too much about it, i went through that once too.  If they get too annoying just ignore them and walk away from the situation and if they follow you just tell them to stop.|`|6OxMpo9vaa	ok, first of all dont worry. when they start on you just walk away. maybe you should apologize to the guy you punched, maybe his friends are acting like that to defend him.<br>  <br>  some boys can be silly at that age but they will grow out of it.|`|xgvPCQXsaa	They might be jealous of you that what it sound like though.   Just try not be around them if you can.|`|Udrr7hTsaa	Kyle is afraid of you. He found out just how far he could push you. He'll back off for now. The other guys are still just jerks. I have always noticed that people alone are very different than in A group. Acceptance meens everything. What A pitty.|`|OtcRpNKSaa	Ignore Them,when they make fun of you just walk away and do not listen to them.Listen to your heart.You know why you ignore them because the more you ignore them the more they will not do it.Later when they stop,you will confidence.
VfFB5wSJaa	I agree with you. Isnt there anything you can do? Have you tried bringing your pleas to the court? The government is made up of crooks and lazy asses. Of course they don't do anything. They're overpaid. Our world is in a recession, but of course they're salaries need raising. My heart reaches out for you. You need to stand up for what is right. Unless the dad is also an ***, you should think of this in a positive light. Do you really want a bad influence around your children?|`|cI19nesraa	I don't know how old your girls are but that is probably not a conversation to have with them.  If is kinda like what you think of him is not their business.  Sadly you are in the same boat as a lot of other good Moms out there.  Show your girls your strength, be a model for independence and self reliance and raise them to respect themselves too much to choose someone who won't live up to their responsibilities for a partner..|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	Yes, you should go back to court.  That's nuts.  You won't need to tell your girls anything, they will form their own opinions and if they haven't already figured it out.

ifC1aFHxaa	Your parents are CRAZY! Totally deranged.<br>  When you are older you wil be more mature and can make your own choices about what kind of stuff you do online, but parents have a duty to provide a safe, wholesome environment for children to grow up in.<br>  The Internet is a source of tremendous knowledge and information, as well as a tremendous source of trouble.<br>  One source is porn. <br>  Learning how to relate to members of the opposite sex (or, for that matter, the same sex, groups of people, animals, inanimate objects, etc) by watching what happens online is completely inappropriate.<br>  It reinforces all the worst kinds of promiscuous, provocative, dangerous behavior.<br>  I also think it is pretty naive of your parents to think that you will only talk with guys that you know.<br>  The Internet is dynamite, that's for sure. and it needs to be handled as such.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	Does it make you wonder if your parents care about your safety and what watching porn is going to do to your realism of a sex?  I'm with the parents that are strict.  It drives me up the wall when I'm at the mall with my 6 year old little girl and have to see 1/2 naked women and see my own daughter blush.  I'm not a prude woman, but there is something to be said for maintaining the innocents of a child.  I think the same for you at 14, you shouldn't be exposed to porn and talking to guys you don't know that may be lying.  It's just dirty and a guy hearing you talk about porn/chatting is just going to pursue you as a piece.|`|Wh30AODBaa	I agree with you in the respect that yes it shouldn't matter what you watch cause its not like since you watch porn you'll have sex all the time. <br>  <br>  I'm 16 and I understand what you mean but at the same time your parents are just worried that your gonna get pregnant or something. that's just how they are and they cant trust you. I personally think its ridiculous but its true we dont really know the fear until were there in your parents place as adults...<br>  <br>  for now though I suggest hiding from them until they trust you more.<br>  <br>  but like I said I agree :)|`|e62f95518e0bb700635945c8033d6bceaa	If porn isn't such a big issue then you wouldn't have a problem with your sister, mother or girl/boyfriend doing it? What about your SO....down the road?<br>  <br>    Sex is a part of life....but it goes along with moral and ethical rules that form healthy relationships. 14 is too young to have a good grasp of those aspects and how they are applied.<br>  <br>    When you are older.......?<br>  <br>     No one will care because you will be seeing and able to grasp the entire picture instead of just one aspect or in other words.....just the ding-aling|`|OHc3g97Gaa	i can relate. my parents talked to me about this. i'm 13, the don't want you watching  that stuff. you might get in trouble with your future girl/boyfriend.|`|TGfwEtUPaa	no I actually don't agree with you. there goes a lot with watching that.  when you are younger your mind and body hasn't fully developed.  it sounds cliche, old school, crazy but when you are older you will know your parents were right and you wont allow your kids to do it. a lot goes into respecting your parents, people that didn't respect their parents have a lot of problems accepting authority when they are older, that means in the professional environment and as a citizen.  Abt watching porn, your hormones kick in crazily and all you will want is sex. At 14, nor your body or your mind is ready for it.|`|vp8806Eraa	The issue is that real sex is not like pornography. If you form your opinions on sex based on the stuff you watch online, it's likely that you'll form a viewpoint which isn't exactly normal. Adults would rather their children formed their views and attitudes based on rational middle-grounds rather than extreme sources. It's fair and reasonable for parents to want their children not to watch pornography, and fairly irresponsible to allow a 14 year old unbridled access to the internet.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	when you haven't had personal experience with sex then pornos give you an unrealistic view of sex and sexuality.  For someone who doesn't know what to expect re: sex, pornos create false expectations and in some cases, unnecessary fears.  <br>  <br>  Pornos only deal with titillation and not with the profound communication and bonding that happens to a couple during sex.<br>  <br>  I have yet to see anything in a porno that was realistic or that accurately reflects sex as it happens between a loving couple.<br>  <br>  In the same way the excessively violent movies numb you to real violence, excessively graphic sexually explicit movies (sex for sex's sake) numb you to real sex.

If she had fun, she'll want to go on another date and if you wait 2 or 3 days before calling, she might think you're not interested.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, you don't want to seem clingy and dependent on her, so I'd say wait at least 24 hours or so.|`|6FdAFgXjaa	i think you should call her/text her/whatever saying that it was fun and how did she like the date? try and find out whether shes up for a second date, then leave the subject for a few days.<br>  this doesnt mean avoid her or anything - text her like you normally do, because if you dont a lot of girls will look at it like your off them.<br>  talk to her as normal and after about 4 days just say- what are you doing this weekend? then ask her if shed like to go out again<br>  :) goood luck anyway, and have fun on your second date! aha|`|gmpvLQ3Qaa	wait a week to make it look like you havent whent love struck.. if she doesnt call in that week.. you call her and make small talk, like how have you been and the date was good, and when your bout to get off ask her if she wants to go on another date.. thats what i did and works everytime|`|ej9X4I2baa	u should never wait at the end of the date when u take her home tell her this was alot of fun and i was wondering if we could do it agian sometime thats how real men do it don't be shy whenit comes to getting what u want the shy guys end up with the ugly girls !!!|`|rvCbwX1Paa	You should call her the day after the date to let her know you had a good time and really liked hanging out.

We were standing online for the roller coaster and he said, "I'd like to see you again. Would you like to go out next weekend?" I immediately said "yes."<br>  <br>  We had a great relationship.

We got along great, and NEVER played games with each other's heads.<br>  It made it easy to trust him, knowing he was always open and honest with me.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	You can call as early as the next day. Leaving a lady to wait more than a couple days is extremely frustrating, and sends out the signal that you're not as interested as she had hoped. That doesn't mean the second date has to be the next day or anything, but at least let her know the interest is there and make plans for later in the week.<br>  <br>  Just don't call the night of the first date...that just comes across as a bit creepy and weird.|`|9fc6963cbdae594803724cff5fd4fb54aa	the best thing to do is call either the day right after the date or two days later. girls like to feel secure and if you wait too long, they'll think you don't like her. however, you can't rush right into things and you want to make her a little nervous and excited so 2 days is really the perfect time. not too long to turn them off, but long enough to keep things exciting.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	send her a tm the next day and ask her if she wants to go to ???? next weekend<br>  <br>  don't ask in person|`|p7Z5H8ftaa	make sure she seemed into you. text her something today like about a conversation youi guys had like little jokes like if you guys fought over how she doesnt like sushi and you do be like "I still cant believe you dont like sushi" nd shell be like "lol believe it" or sumthin then be like well if youd like to hangout again i guess we dont have to go get sushi" really its annoying when guys try to be all formall and only call to ask on a date you can call just to talk and make fun of us, so long as ur joking ya know? then be like so when are we hanging out- unless you found me unbearable lol" and if she says idk at all good chances are she dont like you and if shes like "when would you like to hangout then maybe be like "i was thinking as soon as possible but i didnt wanna appear desperate lol" and then after ur second date give her a few days|`|t6sDVUI4aa	There is always the three day rule. It tends to be so accepted because it is a good rule of thumb to follow.|`|20039aba7a36cb3e425af1248cd6ad5daa	2 days tell her you had fun see how things are goin blah blah n then ask her if she wants to do it again.you wait too long n she'll move on to somebody else|`|196b73911133c4d75053bfa6ae887857aa	Call her or text a day or two later to talk, but wait at least 3 days before asking her out on another date|`|Q49EEdzbaa	ASAP!|`|bYVCrZ8Maa	3 days|`|js2TUHFdaa	2 days!|`|OyWVqe23aa	wait a few days, make her sweat.
p7Z5H8ftaa	your putting too much stress on yourself. when you guys are on the date, if your not feeling it or you feel like shes not feeling it, ask her "you wanna go do something else or shall we call it a night" then if she has plans she can do that and if she likes you maybe shell say "hmm well i like going {here} if you wanna checkit out|`|sCCjAKllaa	Take her home.|`|scyLaz0saa	First take it one step at a time.  If drinks work then offer to take a walk with her somewhere.  If it is nice out outside you can do that.  Or you know what is a good place.  Go to borders and have drinks.  They have a great coffee shop and then afterwards you can go around the store looking a books, movies and music.  If you get stuck on a topic comment on a book you've read or something.  I hope it works out for you.  Be yourself and have fun.  Good luck.|`|yte0BzXKaa	If you want sex then take her back to your place and it will happen.<br>  If you don't want sex then call it a night and call her in the morning.|`|ENZVi0Ptaa	You can or if it's early enough suggest dinner|`|OyWVqe23aa	i say go back to your place... :P|`|UAnlYPIMaa	well do what you feel comfortable,<br>  i mean its a first date she might not be the girl to take back to where ever and "you kno".<br>  but do what you feel, and she how she's reacting if she looks a little tired say hey i was gona ask if ud like to [ go to the park, beach, where ever ] but you look kinda tired.<br>  maybe she'll wanna go maybe not?<br>  or if she doesnt look tired at all and kinda looks like you guys had more to do ask her so go somewhere, <br>  <br>  idk if that'll help at all, good luck|`|McfrauFnaa	play it by ear. every girl gives signals of what they want out of any kind of encounter. but i hope she doesn't look up yahoo answers too, or else you're fucked, lol it kinda makes you sound desperate bro. just sayin.|`|4P7N6XULaa	what about dinner drinks? or drinks dinner? either way you could cut the date short if it doesn't go well.<br>  I would do dinner then if you both wanted you could go out after dinner for some drinks and see where you end up.<br>  have fun|`|MZWH11w1aa	If you like her and think you want to start dating, either say goodnight or ask if she wants to get dinner or dessert...or see a movie.

AA11312653	Do not tell this lady off. It is unwise to burn a bridge, as someday you may want to use that bridge. Simply decline to attend her wedding. Do not apologize and do not explain. All you need to say is "I'm sorry, but it's impossible" without any further details. <br>  <br>  Set her a good example by sending a very warm and friendly handwritten letter of congratulations on good stationery.|`|CM1dfztQaa	It sounds like she has been so caught up in herself, that she doesn't realize that she has slighted you. I've been there, so I understand the sentiment. I've always been a better friend to people than they have been to me. Sometimes I want to remind them of that, but I usually don't.<br>  <br>  It's okay to be upset, but if you value the friendship, don't let it ruin things between you. Facts are facts, and if you can't afford it, she should be more understanding. After all, she spent nothing on you.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it's easier to take a step back for a while and just not have any contact. She's got a lot going on right now and may not be receptive to this conversation until things calm down after the wedding. Give it time. If your friendship is strong, things will fix.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I can actually understand your friend's side of things.  Did you invite her to the ceremony?  If not, she may have felt like you weren't hoping for other people to celebrate the wedding with you.  I have been on the other side of the fence when close friends and family member just had a small courthouse wedding without inviting anybody.  Usually, the news sneaks up on you in an expected way.  "Oh by the way, I just got married" or "I'm just about to be married next week."  When people don't invite you to celebrate in the ceremony and don't even tell you until after the fact or a few days before, it gives the impression that they are treating it as something really low-key and makes you feel awkward to make too big of a deal about it.  That's not to say I don't see your side of things and that your marriage isn't as important as those of brides who had bigger weddings.  But I can see why she would feel that a wedding gift wasn't expected if you didn't invite her and made it seem as though you just walked into a courthouse one day.<br>  <br>  As far as her getting married, your wedding are two seperate events.    You shouldn't be comparing the two.  If you never invited her to watch you get married, she could just as easily make the comparison and complain that she doesn't mean enough to you for you to even have her at your wedding when she's having you stand-up at hers.  Anyway, you are not obligated to be in the wedding party at all if it's beyond your means.  If you can't afford it, you shouldn't feel obligated to attend.  It's better to not go if you are just going to feel resentful about it.|`|AA11380378	You did not send her an invitation, thus she is not obligated to "reply" in paper. She was not a guest.<br>  <br>  You honestly sound jealous and scorned that she's having a big wedding. She actually was very thoughtful and generous to include you and OFFER to fly you in.<br>  <br>  A lady would RSVP with regrets and leave it at that. Your envy is getting in the way of behaving like an adult.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	did you send out a formal announcement that you were married or did word just reach her through the grapevine?<br>  <br>  people actually don't send gifts unless they are very close to you without some kind of formal announcement.  If you didn't send out formal announcements that you got married then it was assumed that you didn't need any type of public acknowledgement. <br>  <br>  you've said the two of you are no longer close.  She didn't do anything wrong.<br>  <br>  If you're done with the friendship because you've out grown each other then be done with it, but to end it because she didn't send you a gift for your marriage is not a good reason.|`|l43NSgHyaa	It seems like you've grown apart, which is OK.   You can politely decline the invite and start to separate yourself from the relationship.   It was rude that she didn't give you a card, but that doesn't mean you have the right to belittle the decisions she makes with her own money, her own wedding and such.<br>  <br>  So, I agree that maybe it's time to end the friendship.   But, I'm just letting you know, it seems like you're holding a lot of animosity towards her just because she has more money.<br>  <br>  From the way the post read, she isn't forcing you to fly out to her wedding, buy a dress or anything else.  It seems like she made a simple request for you to attend and even offered to pay for some of your expenses.   That was very nice and she is under no obligation (regardless of her income) to do that.  But, you're still pitching a fit about it.   I'm not trying to be mean, but what do you want from her? Do you think just because she makes 200K a year, she should pay for your airfare, dress, hotel and your spending money during your duration of her wedding weekend?<br>  <br>  It's clear, you're holding something against her, just because she makes more money.   That makes you no better than her.<br>  <br>  In the end, neither of you are right.  She wasn't right for not sending a card, but you're not right for protesting her wedding, just because you feel she's putting on a big show. If she's putting on a big show, that's her business.  She has more than enough money to do so!!!<br>  <br>  So, I think it's best you stay home.  I'm sure she didn't invite you, so she could be surrounded by your negativity.|`|5gtbGwMPaa	I think you both have been hurt.  She's upset because she wants you to be there with her on her special day.  Your upset because she didn't acknowledge you on yours.  Be the bigger person and give her a call.  Explain how you're feeling and hopefully, you can put this behind you and continue with the friendship.|`|4cJZ3SIWaa	You are correct. She shows much gall and lack of shame in expecting you to spend a lot of money when she did not even bother to get you a gift.<br>  <br>  This is not a friend and in a very diplomatic fashion, you should consider ending this relationship.<br>  <br>  Don't show anger...|`|GxSnVRAOaa	You are not crazy!  I can't believe she didn't even send you a card!!!  She expects way too much for what she gives back to her friends.  I wouldn't go, just apologize and tell her you are unable to make it.  Obviously she couldn't make it to yours so...|`|EKp4Cg0vaa	Honey I got one word for a girl like your friend. BRIDEZILLA! And that's me being nice.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Ugghhh I am practically in the same boat as you are, and today i told my step-sister that I may just not be in her wedding at all!  She is so greedy and selfish, over half of her 9 bm's are jobless and she wants us to get everything from specific shoes to jewlery! Plus she made us hair appts at an expensive salon and told us all today!!!

DO NOT date him!|`|qDBjH4s8aa	Genetically, you are not very close, and it should not be a problem. You only have one common grandparent, not two.

This is why it is so dangerous for people to have lots of kids with different men/women.  He is still your cousin.  Have blood tests taken to see if your related.|`|z5aQccxoaa	Yes!

VfFB5wSJaa	It wasn't meant to be. Buy yourself some choclate ice cream, have a girls night out, maybe get a makover, a new haircut and a manicure to boost your confidence. Get up and get out there. There are hundreds of eligable, sweet guys out there-leave it in the hands of fate.|`|laHLW1yQaa	Best way to get over a boy is another boy and then another boy and another boy.  By they you will have had fun and totally forgot the first one.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you are both young but this one feels like it is his loss.  He figured out he likes girls....just not what to do with liking.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	It sounds like a short lived romance.  Be glad you didn't have anything else invested in this relationship.  Put your energy into something you enjoy doing or believe strongly in.  I'm sure he has every intentions of tossing his lastest victim aside in no time.|`|7t4vpqpyaa	Dont think about him and do hobbies you like also get a new man|`|83TkWic3aa	Beat him with a lead pipe.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously, ignore him-he wasn't worth your time.|`|bZGv0dvnaa	sleep with the first guy u see.... then problem solved
YXGdwwTJaa	You cannot stop as the emotion is so firmly planted in your mind and heart that it will take ages and ages before it does, eventually, fade.  What you have lost is your hopes, plans and imaginings about your future together, which is as real to you as if it had actually happened.  It is a grieving process almost as bad as that of losing  some relative as you have shared a life together and planned for the future, but that is now all gone.   We all lose someone we love when they die but we also lose them when they go away and leave us.  <br>        It would be easier if you accept the pain, grief and loss, put up with it and try to distract yourself with your work, which sounds very demanding.   It is likely the pain will lessen with time, but it will not feel possible at the moment.  You keep on looking at her website and finding out things about her - this is counter productive, but I suppose you will still do it, but it will not help the pain of loss. <br>  <br>  I hope you will eventually realize that you had the gift of love,  and it was good then.  But to have loved and lost is no consolation.  I wish you happiness and contentment.

wia9SXCPaa	He's been hurt.  You have to decide if he is worth waiting for.  Its a pretty big deal to divorce once, he's done it twice.  I don't think I could have made it a year - your a saint!|`|dD5uhH8naa	it depends on how long you are willing to wait for him to be relaxed and totally comfortable with you if you have time stick it out and see what happens|`|0d0W0nbVaa	when a guy says "can't promise anything",  that means he's tagging you along until something better comes by.<br>  <br>  sorry. it is what it is.|`|PyRxe9B2aa	You are now finding out why he is divorced so many times. You have to see it. He will not get any better or change EVER girl and that is why he is divorced. MOVE ON and do it now. Learn to be your own best friend.

uBssj3Znaa	who cares what your MIL thinks. Jobs are few and far inbetween right now and your husband is trying to do the right thing so that you, he and your baby will be taken care of. <br>  <br>  You are adults, so act like it and do what is right for you and your family|`|Eug52iQDaa	First, GO!  In these times you go where the jobs are.  Second, how about going to see your MIL.  Give her a HUGE hug and tell her that you understand completely how much she'll miss you all and the baby, but as adults, you have to be responsible and do what's necessary.  Promise to visit as often as you can, and send lots of pictures of the baby inbetween.<br>  <br>  It's up to you to be adult and rise above the inlaws, sweetie.  You'll do a wonderful job raising your daughter, and may actually gain some respect from the inlaws after being on your own away from them.<br>  <br>  You can DO it!!  But do it with kindness and an understanding of how much they love their granddaughter, ok?<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|KZXequigaa	Move and move fast!!! I moved 10 hours away from my MIL from hell! <br>  You and your husband need to do for you and your family, not for her. It honestly sounds like you and your hubby will be better off with the new job anyhow. Your MIL needs to chill out and realize she is NOT the mother of your daughter, and that you and your husband are doing it for you, not for her. She'll get over it, and she'll have visits at holiday time. If she doesn't get over it, that's on her, not you and your husband for bettering yourselves.|`|ogtHK7Eiaa	GOOD IDEA LEAVE ASAP<br>  FIRST OF ALL YOU ALL NEED UR SPACE LIVING NEXT DOOR TO EACHOTHER WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA ANYWAY...AND U AND UR HUSBAND ID GROWN UNLESS THERE WILLING TO HELP U FINACIALLY AND PAY ALL BILLS THEN THEY SHOULDNT HAVE NO SAY SO, OBVIOUSLY THINGS ARE NOT GOING SO WELL SO IT BASICALLY GIVES U KNOW CHOICE.

7TcxJqW4aa	Give up on him girl. There are plenty of guys in this world, so don't date one that has already dated your friend. That shows his lack of "like" for you. If he liked you he would have never dated one of your friends. Start your search for a new guy... He doesn't deserve another year of waiting for him to finally decide he likes you too. If it's meant to be you'll be together regardless so don't waste your precious time now. Be strong and move on. Good luck|`|96zZlJVYaa	ask him is the best way to know for yourself. here is 3 questions to ask him the next time you two talk.<br>  <br>  1) do you like me and if so, do you like me as a friend or possible girlfriend.<br>  <br>  2) have I ever cross your mind. if so as a friend or gf?<br>  <br>  3) if a guy come to you and start asking questions about me (which is you) how would you react and what will you tell this guy about you.|`|1Lo34oEDaa	just talk to him ask one of his friends who he likes you know that kind of stuff just dont loose hope until you know the facts good luck =)|`|sCCjAKllaa	You need to ask him and not try to be a mind reader. It's really that simple. If you think he likes you, then at least talk to him; if you strongly feel he doesn't, then don't worry about it.|`|Q49EEdzbaa	Do you really this person, you called him a kid. Or is it just lust. You probabally like him becuz one of your friends did! maybe? perhaps? Just think about it.|`|edfyA9kPaa	ask him.<br>  I asked my friend if he liked me when he knew i did and he said no and then a couple weeks later he asked me out. so.. idk.|`|sZ1vyyiQaa	Go for it be straight up and come out and tell him how u feel. If thats not good write him a letter and have one of ur bff give it to him|`|FeguWBvBaa	if you how his cell number text him if not work up the courage to ask him out or ask if he likes you|`|rZWjPP9xaa	dont give up if ur reall like him because if theres something there u dont want to let it go|`|689fa4b232bbdc287f4623b8e3e5e49eaa	It sounds as though you are a bit shy? Well, he might be, also.<br>  <br>  You need a "meeting of the minds." If he is more shy than you, you may have to make the first move. And, since you don't know just how shy he is, you need to let him know, "for sure," that you are interested in him. Don't assume and don't try to read his mind.<br>  <br>  Do some flirtatious talking and communication with him. Not just once, but a few times. He will get the hint. Then, let him take it from there. If he doesn't, you need to get on with your life and look elsewhere.<br>  <br>  Do not trust (you notice I said "trust")  that your friends can get  the message to him. Get up the nerve and do it on your own. That is the only way you will know for sure.<br>  <br>  P.S. Your GF DID NOT forget that you liked this guy. Let's be real, here. Learn to be wary and wise and know this is a fact and it happened once .already.
6oASoFr7aa	age anit got nuthin to do wit it, but the truth is age got everything to do with. Chicks who like olda men want security now, but  alot of the chicks i done seen who done took this route never end up doing nothing with themselves. don't base your lives off celebrities I would say the olda you get the less age matters, but yall look young really young. Right now is the perfect time for yall to get out yall feelings and get into them books. Honestly puttin love on the back burner always pays off, later in life because when you meeet someone you really like, who's single, on the same page as you and they ask why you single you can be like because i was doing this and this and this and you'll have more to sho for your time. 18 and 25, dats bad but not too bad, it depends more on the aurora of the person.|`|H4rEZ0rCaa	i don't get it? "/|`|JCdBSULraa	This question is pretty vague.   I think women who date older guys generally have issues with their daddies.  So for men to date younger women, they need to be especially caring of them and treat them like children instead of equals.   Generally I don't think there's a good answer to your question, because it's entirely case-by-case though.|`|ER94paD2aa	well it depends on the two people. <br>  a lot of times girls date older guys because, they are on the same maturity level..because guys mature later than girls do...<br>  love is love lol|`|B83DTe78aa	o my god.

Would that make YOU any less of a good person, worthy of all kinds of friends?

Love life is never ever successful 100% guarantee so pis the love or like thingss and do something else and when the time comes you won't even see it and you wont even wat to get married because of the other ability like sports you built up.

AA11312653	How about "love and marriage" theme with rings, hearts, doves, all the traditional symbols. You have the rest of your life to give Arabian Nights parties, Roaring Twenties parties, and Hawaiian luaus, but the day you marry is the only day you can have a wedding theme party. You don't want to be one of those pathetic Yahoo questioners wanting to have a second wedding [aka vow revewal] in the traditional way since you "didn't get a real wedding" the first time around.|`|CM1dfztQaa	If you choose to go with a theme, the idea should involve things that interest both of you. For example, when I first got engaged, my fiance and I talked about having a Renaissance theme that also Incorporated his love of motorcycles.<br>  <br>  We were going to make it a family affair. It was to include a pig roast, jugglers, face painting for the kids (there were a lot between our two families), and live minstrels. Then we were going to leave the reception on his motorcycle instead of a live horse.<br>  <br>  It all depends on what each of your interests are. But it's important to talk to each other about ideas.|`|wsF1bXL3aa	theme,all dress like pirates and loot and pillage the venue|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Wait until you are engaged to decide since your groom gets a vote as well.

Fun, fun!!<br>  <br>  You can google "wedding themes" and it comes up with so much...  It's fun to look at each one to see how it was played up. :)|`|4POGapREaa	What do you mean by theme?

AA11460234	I'd say nothing. Place it in a folder to save in case she needs to retrieve it. Plain and simple it sounds as though she's venting. Or practicing.<br>  In any case she's warming up for the big show down or maybe even letting off some steam because she hasn't the nerve to say this to him face to face.<br>  <br>  Your business is to stay away and ignore this. She has her ducks in a row and if she needs any help she strikes me as a person who isn't afraid to ask.<br>  <br>  Let sleeping dogs lie.|`|AA10447831	Yeah, help her find a lawyer as she is obviously unhappy.  ...or at least a counselor|`|ikXRqWxUaa	i would pretend like i didn't see it...but i would continue to be a good friend to her and be there to listen to her.|`|rawz0RJuaa	well i wanted to say that you need to just not say anything because it is her business... but if she just left it out like that, maybe she did so in hopes that someone would see it and she would finally have someone to confide in. <br>  i would go to her and say you accidentally saw it because she left it out and see if she needs to talk to you. you are her friend so be there for her. perhaps you could even help her work things out.<br>  good luck|`|NGKwsawdaa	First off you shouldn't have read that letter if it wasn't meant for you. and second off you shouldn't be sharing that with the entire Y/A. That is her own personal business. She put the letter on your computer bc she trusts you with it not because she wanted you to share it with us.|`|nWUJgykxaa	because she left it on YOUR computer, I would talk to her about it.  She may have just been venting her anger though!  Again, ask her about it!|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	Wow, I think I'll keep a copy for myself. Great stuff.<br>  It's her letter, you agreed she could use the computer.  Drop it.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	he woman is direct. I like it . Hope she goes through with it.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	MYOB|`|C1SFDyOhaa	just try and be a friend.do not mention what you found,just ask her for coffee and start some girl talk.mabye she will open up|`|N86vHKxtaa	You might ask if she intended you to find it.  If she says no, let it go.  If she talks, listen.  Remember, either way, it's truly HER problem and all you should do is be a good, supportive listener.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	That's a awkward situation. Maybe she wrote that letter to get her emotions out and doesn't intend on sending it. Maybe she didn't realize she left it there. I wonder if theres a way that you can suggest it was there without making it sound like you snooped and read it. Or... maybe just sit down and ask her how things are going and just give her the impression that she can come to you for support. You dont have to say you found the letter.. you can just say... If you ever need anything, give me a call, etc.|`|dEeFaUN7aa	i think you should ask him about her problem, try to give her your opinion and support her..she really need somebody to listen to her..try your best to be by her side..|`|dD5uhH8naa	I thinks its harsh but you should mind your business and allow her to talk if that's what she wants|`|TZpFcx47aa	Just stay out of all that. Sounds like things are a little rocky to say the least over there. Never know though, tomorrow, it may all be fine again. I agree with myob.|`|prkyT6l3aa	Talk with her but not the husband in case it was just something she wrote to let out anger on or was too scared to actually send it. But since it was on your computer tell her that if she needs any help that your there for her and you will help her find a marriage counsel or even a lawyer.<br>  <br>  good luck:]|`|qczTENowaa	Good for her, marriage sucks anyway, she'll be doing both of them a favor.<br>  <br>  Too harsh??? Nahh, just a little too long.<br>  <br>  She could have said the same thing with less than half the words...|`|tcvQwTa5aa	Yes,that's very harsh.Why doesn't she just move out and send him divorce papers?That's what I did.She doesn't have to dig her fingernails into him so deeply,it's so cruel.Sounds like she has alot of bottled up hatred and bitterness towards this man.She really needs to move out now or make him leave if it's her place.Why go through so much drama?If she keeps carrying all that anger around she's gonna end up sick.Carrying anger especially can give you stomach problems,headaches,high blood pressure,it's not worth it.|`|POHWTDPRaa	I wouldn't say anything unless she specifically asks you about it. Having it saved to the desktop but doesn't mean she meant for you to find it. She could have just had an absent minded moment and saved it to the wrong place or completely forgot to delete it. Just pretend you never saw it.|`|6jXuUCdraa	talk to her about it. shes obviously pretty depressed and needs your help. it was probably a sign.
iPNOVR6Gaa	For me, it's different things about different women.  Whatever is her best feature is probably what I notice first.  Maybe it's her eyes, or her smile, or her hair.  Maybe she has great legs or a perfectly curved backside.  Maybe she has an enchanting way of laughing, or she touches my arm or something when she talks.  Maybe she's dressed in something really awesome looking.  It depends.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	HAIR!  The first thing I notice about a woman is her hair.  It tells a LOT about what type of a peson she is.  Is it straight and long?  Is it treated wtih 5 different shades of highlights?  Is it worn messy?  Is it worn neat?  Is she wild and crazy with it?  Or is she conservative and traditional?  The way a woman wears her hair says a lot about her!<br>  <br>  #2 = Body since you're still probably 20 feet away at this point.  (love curves on women instead of stick thin) <br>  <br>  #3 = Face since this is usually the last thing you notice when you get close enough to check her out.<br>  <br>  #4 = Make up.  Is she soft and natural or is she heading to the strip club? <br>  <br>  #5 = Her boyfriend or husband (who is usually pisssed at this point that she's smiling back at me!)|`|0d0W0nbVaa	t*ts and @ss.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	Swagger is related to butt.  Not size, mind you... the character of the butt is actually fundamental in the swagger.  Some smaller butts have dry character and larger butts can be hottt with the right swagger.<br>  <br>  About 3 months ago I joined a gym and I watch everyone on the treadmills while I'm lifting weights behind them.  There is an AMAZING difference in swaggers.  I could choose lovers and friends just by how they walk on the treadmill.|`|aD8Xmhdiaa	i usually notice height and facial features.<br>  i love that little patch of hair on their chin, i make my boyfriend keep his lol.|`|iQqsdl5yaa	Eyes and back|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Eyes, and eye contact, pretty smiles. Not really into having body preferences but I could pick it would be a nice hiney, shapely, and a little size to it.

q0H3St1Oaa	That's just the tradition of their countries.<br>  <br>  Many Muslims raised in America don't have arranged marriages.<br>  <br>  I had one for love. ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  And Islam says all people are  equal under God. In marriage I think it says the man is dominant.|`|AORcLwTNaa	yeah its hooriba;e what these people do to their daughters. in islam, you cant be forced to marry|`|0d0W0nbVaa	i personally think people should keep their religion to themselves, and not force it down anyone's throat, including your own kids. <br>  <br>  but then, that's just me.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	Read your bible.

AA11299735	You need to make clear to her that you wished she had been there when you were seriously ill.  that having been said, she might find the BFf commitment to be a little less stringent than you.  You seem young, so I might suggest that loosen up a little and see how that goes.  if you are too clingy with people they can either be put off or walk all over your feelings.  Decide how you want to behave as a best friend and see if thats reflected.  either way, i wouldnt lose a lot of sleep over it.  Friends are friends and if you care for one another and enjoy one anothers company then thats all for the best.  Hope this helps.|`|y5MZ6U7Gaa	I know exactly what you're talking about.  Goes around calling a bunch of people her best friend and such...  You said that she wasn't there for you when you were ill,  to her you're probably just a back-up friend.  Someone to drag along so that she's never alone.  Try to talk to her, if she can't be serious about it, I'd find some new friends (easier said than done, I know....).|`|rZWjPP9xaa	no i understand but get  over it the fact that she has other bf u  should be secure with the relationship u n her share|`|aegzexWzaa	depends on your age sometimes. if you are teenager-adult period,  then you should rebuild  your friendship, if you are teenager or younger then may be you have  grown to like different things and are growing up to be different people. it happens quite often.<br>  <br>  my best friend and i have been friends for 4-5 years, we give each other space but we , if want to go somewhere and spent some time together we just say so straight away.|`|ogtHK7Eiaa	I THINK THAT U SHOULD BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH HER AND SHE NEED TO LET U KNOW WHERE U STAND AT WITH HER SO THAT U WONT BE CONFUSED, MAYBE UR JUST A FRIEND TO HER EVEN A FRIEND WILL BE THERE IN UR TIME OF NEED AND UR BESTFRIEND WILL BE THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND IT IS OKAY TO HAVE MORE THEN ONE BESTFRIEND BUT TOO MANY MAKE THE TITLE LESS IMPORTANT...

7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	Yes, you can be proved wrong.  But you can also do a lot of damage to her if you string her along, especially if you become sexually active without voicing your concerns to her.<br>  <br>  Make sure she knows you aren't sure you have enough in common to make things work, and be honest with her as things progress.<br>  <br>  Remember that girls are often willing to try way to hard to make something work.  Sure, you can have some fun with her, but make sure you don't break her up bad by just using her and dumping her.  That's not cool.|`|SNC58uQvaa	There are so many girls available, never go for one that you have any doubts about.<br>  <br>  Each and every time I acted against my doubts, I was sorry later.<br>  <br>  Wait until you find someone that you have no doubts about.|`|jSd6qCwHaa	you could ... give it a try|`|Z771jOf8aa	Well, you have to see what will happen bro.  In my opinion, you are doing the right thing by giving her a chance.  But at the end, I still hope that you find your true love.

Sometimes you grow to care about someone a whole lot and then realize that you are both very different or that your goals, lifestyles, religion and etc will put a stake in your relationship. You could definitely be proved wrong the same as any relationship no matter how different or alike you both may be. <br>  <br>  Try dating for a while or hang out as friends. Either way hardly anyone really knows whether or not something will work out. Wish you the best!|`|s7seaaPkaa	of course,you never know if you get to know her truely you could end up falling in love . you also could end up not liking her but you'll never know untill you give it a chance.|`|moJkJhFNaa	dont do her any favors by letting her date you... It might hurt now that youre not giving her the attention she wants... but it will hurt her later when you realize you didnt really want her... stay back!|`|AQGlcbG6aa	if you don't like a girl don't experiment on her <br>  if she really likes you and you pretend to like her she'll feel pretty bad|`|mbUo44wFaa	You can love anyone.

6sTsDvKmaa	The age old question....<br>  <br>  Okay, yes, it's true.  The nice guy does often finish last, (but he does finish!) and I'll tell you why I think this is true.  <br>  <br>  When the nice guy asks a girl out, he does it with the attitude of "Here I am, belly up, please like me.  If you don't say yes I'll be devastated but be hopefully looking for another girl to notice how nice I am."<br>  <br>  When the confident guy asks you out, it's more like "I could choose to be with any other girl but I choose you.  I can make you feel safe.  Choose me and I'll show you my soft underbelly."<br>  <br>  Think of it as a job interview.  On the surface, the confident guy seems like he can offer you more.  He gets you with his charisma and good looks.  The nice guy is often more committed to doing a good job, but on the surface he may appear like he is lacking in spine. <br>  <br>  The winner would be a combination of both.  He makes you feel like you're the only one for him, but is still confident in himself.  <br>  <br>  It's a balancing act that takes a long time to master.  All you can do is keep trying.|`|S4VVE0onaa	well see women do really like nice guys its just they presume that the nice guy is nice to everyone and that him being nice to her means nothing more than that. whereas the guy that teases is letting her know that he is interested cause he is aiming all his attention towards that one girl.|`|oSkcbg0Uaa	Kinda...It depends on the girl too. It kinda tells you what kind of person she is if she goes for the jerkish attitude. So just be yourself and dont try to hard :] Be a nice guy the good girls will go fer that!|`|9aBKmhbZaa	maybe they like to know that someone is in control but i think that nice guys don't or most always end up last... but some are just to nice and are only consider friends...|`|89rZWzsdaa	well as a girl i can tell you that most women actually do like the nice guy. I don't know how old you are but I know that for women when they are younger a lot of them go toward the assholes because they want a fun fling, but in the end most women want to and do end up with the nice guy. So, if you want flings then sure go ahead with the asshole routine... but if you are looking for an actual relationship stay with the nice guy, but you know throw in a little edge once and a while. I know, personally, i would love to find a guy who is sweet but knows how to loosen up and get in touch with his "bad side". So all the best, hope you find what you are looking for|`|jdah4ZA2aa	I think what that saying might apply in the sense that nice guys attract nice girls ... it may take longer, but when they get together it is bound to be long-lasting and pleasant.  Guys who catch girls who like to play games usually get more games, or a girl that brings tons of problems to the relationship.|`|p7Z5H8ftaa	yeah cuz ur not awkward and annoying, its knowing how to regulate it. be the sarcastic asshole but dont push sex, let them make the first move but you can joke like say "well I sleep nude you can match me if youd like"
gjaPNWbTaa	My husband has used TINY amounts to take the edge off a horrendous zit once in a while.  <br>  <br>  I mean.. maybe 5 times in 10 years.

This isnt that bad and ever since that day, It's been Awww-some...<br>  Just give it time...You could also do what my friend did...Practice with somebody else so your not so nervous...In my opinion I wouldnt do that..Or you could not worry about it and do whatever comes naturally...In the end its all up to you...Hopefully this helps! ! !|`|IWO1GTpGaa	Just tell him you want to kiss him so damn bad and you just want him to know that if you aren't a good kisser do not be mad.  After you tell him that pucker up and follow his lead.  If his bottom lip is on your top lip put your top lip on his bottom lip.  Do not force the kiss just softly endure the kisses.  Make sure your mouth is opened so just in case he decides its time to go frenchy you'll be ready.  If his tongue inserts your mouth just let it in and make sure your tongue greets him by licking his tongue.  When his tongue leaves your mouth you can either put your tongue in his mouth or keep kissing him normally.|`|NviCwaroaa	Why do people think we are not part of the animal kingdom?

Don't make a mess or stay in the bathroom too long and she won't bother you. Stay away from her completely. Answer with one word if she talks to you. Don't talk back. Life will be a LOT easier. I'm not taking your mom's side, cuz she sounds like a b****, but try to ignore her and if she keeps on, try talking to someone about it. If you have the heart, call child protection services.|`|qeVqBMVraa	No mum hate their child..<br>  you may only be feeling this..<br>  talk to your mum..<br>  she loves ya..<br>  <br>  I used to feel like this about my mum until i spoke to her and now we best of friends
yTuBS2hbaa	It makes me really sad that people have to worry about stuff like this as young as you are. I mean, really, what is the worst they can do? You said that you are about to enter high school, right? It's extremely likely that this whole clique will dissolve as soon as that happens. People change when going from middle school to high school. Groups of friends dissolve, people move away, the ones that are used to running everything sometimes end up at the bottom of the ladder. Just take into consideration that you are all about to be freshmen, and that pretty much means a clean start. I was the outcast in elementary and middle school, and kind of turned into a social butterfly in high school. It just shows how things change. If "Abigail" insists on being a ***** to you over a school project, maybe you should try and show her what an idiot she's being for it. Or just ignore her. If you pretend like her little melodramas don't bother you, it will drive her nuts. <br>  <br>  I wish I could help more, but I hope this at least helps a little.|`|2WLkCu23aa	Take the beating, get it over with and find new friends.  But I must commend you on your English, its very proper and more legibly written than most crap on here..haha!  Nice job!  If you really fear for your life, you really have to speak with the authorities, no one can help you but them.  Just do your paper as you should and submit it.  When you are doing your almamater, you did ask for permission to use their data right?  If so its no problem, why would these people hate you? No matter which method you choose to leave your association with the Twelves, it will be tough, so I think you should let this be an opportunity.  Try to find others in the group who may also side with you to make it a easier fight.  Try not to think about it so much, as you are scaring yourself more than you need to.  Good luck!|`|LfQiN3Rpaa	wow, that's a lot, but it sounds like to me that these girls aren't people you should even worry about, they obviously aren't very good friends unless your in their group, you said you have two friends that are in the twelve, if they are really your friends they won't fall into believing this girl Abigail. you have other friends then those two, and if they are your true friends they will still love you no matter what she says, there's going to be a lot of people that don't like you, or hate you throughout your whole life, and what I've learned is they don't really matter, all you need is your family, and true friends. if rumors start tell people they aren't true, and if they are explain whats going on so that people understand and don't just assume things. it might hurt to loose some friends over this, but you will always make new ones, and also you will learn who your true friends are, and really they are the only ones you need to keep. and if you do make new friends .. don't trust them right away because that can also result in bad things.|`|hrYFQuqTaa	Dear Ravin,<br>  In school we do what we are supposed to do and we should do our best in it.

Yes, this may seem like the least thing that you would want to do, but, it did work for me.

Just ignore them, they are all just stuck-up-snobs!|`|uFbl7e4oaa	If all of this is true, then you go to a pretty messed up Junior High School.  Abigail just sounds like a dumb egotistical *****.  You should tell her that.  Once you get to high school you'll realize that none of this matters.<br>  <br>  For you, I suggest finding new friends that actually respect you.  If you don't want to deal with Abigail and her 12, then don't pay any attention to them.  Why does it matter what she thinks?  I think you should join a sport or some kind of activity that you enjoy.  Stop worrying about what some dumb girls think of you and live your life.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could start your own group but make it out of guys.  Then, if you were the "leader" you could convince your group to hate Abigail.  If you got the school's male population to hate Abigail, then she will be put in her place.<br>  <br>  Or, if you see her in the hallway or something, yell, "Hey Abigail, **** YOU."  Then kick her in the vagina.|`|ub23m7Praa	I hate drama. <br>  <br>  Just tell her to **** off and that she isn't special or anything. Call her a *****. Call her a whore.

But as you get older, your relationship with your parents becomes more like one of friendship, as you are no longer totally dependent on them as you once were..... so you can grow apart. Your mother probably doesn't give you the benefit of the doubt that she once would have, because you're an adult now, and not just he little girl. <br>  <br>  I know my sister is a lot closer to our parents than I, and I am a lot more inclined to get accosted by my parents for any mildly snide comment. It's just the way things are. Just be very concise if you must spend time with your parents a lot. Make it so they can't misunderstand, or twist what you have said. And, if needs be, say less, as you have been.

Each child is a completely different, unique human being.  You love each child with the same intensity but you love them differently and you respond and react to them differently.<br>  <br>  For whatever reason, your mother seems to take input from your sister better than she takes input from you but that has nothing to do with you and everything to do with your mom.  Don't take it personally.<br>  <br>  It is the way she's interpreting it coming out of your mouth and, yes, it's not fair that your sister can say whatever she wants and you're getting treated like a criminal when you have an opinion.  Don't allow your mother's perception to devalue your ability to speak your mind.<br>  <br>  Your mother is in her own world and she's hearing your words through her own filter.  Know that this is about her, not you.  Speak your mind when you want to speak your mind and don't expect her to take it any other way than the way she does and don't take it personally.  Nothing other people do is because of you; it's because of them.<br>  <br>  Don't change who you are to make someone else, even your mom, feel better.  This is a great opportunity for you to learn how to speak your truth, even if nobody else likes it.<br>  <br>  Here's the bottom line:  Whenever you change your behavior to make someone else feel better, the message you're sending out to that person is this, "What you think of me is more important than what I think of myself."  Do you really want to send that message out to your mother, especially when you know her reaction has everything to do with her and nothing to do with you?  Think about it...

I chalk most of this up to petty jealousy, while myself and my older brother do get along more now versus when we were kid's, I still think that he still in some way has it in for me? The best thing you can do is hope that he grows out of this, and being that he is 15 things should be improving soon? I know you hate him, I know you want him to rot in hell, but trust me, deep down inside, you do have love for him, and somewhere in your brother their is mutual love, you may not think it right now, but he does love you. So when you get angry and when you wish he would rot in hell, remember this stuff will pass, and you will in some way benefit from his bitterness & malice, maybe you will benefit from passing your knowledge and understanding onto another person who is going through the same situation? Whatever the benefits are, or are not, try to always take something bad and turn it into something positive.|`|uURxWBS2aa	hi <br>  dont you think thats a bit strong?

8ilHQMq5aa	im not sure but maybe she needs to spend more time with him|`|nX1QW5GCaa	A lot depends on legal system where you live.  My wife's ex was exactly the same.  When they first split there was a defined schedule of days the boys were to spend at each house.  They were afraid of him and didn't like to spend time there.  Most of the time he wasn't there and they were left in the care of the eldest (13 at the time).  When he was there it was constant yelling etc.  <br>  In Ontario Canada, the courts can appoint a children's lawyer.  The cost is covered by the courts and there is no cost to the parents.  This lawyer interviews children alone and together, then with each parent (on different days). At the end a recommendation is made to the court.  In our case, children were given the right to spend as much or as little time as they wanted with each parent.  Once this was settled in the court, the battles eased.  <br>  You may have to look at getting amendment to any custody order or get one established if you don't have one.  If you argue for the children's right to schedule their own visits, I think at their age, most courts would agree.  <br>  If our experience is any indicator, your battles with this man will never end until the kids are on their own.  It's been 12 years for us and my wife is still fighting to have him pay 1/2 of college education tuition.<br>  Good luck!|`|yte0BzXKaa	He is too controlling and seems somewhat violent.<br>  If your child doesn't want to go and see him then don't force her or she will most likely rebel against you and him or maybe run away (as a teenager i understand she would think of these)<br>  <br>  Talk to him about it and tell him he's going to lose his daughters if he doesn't stop being so controlling. Or give him a taste of his own medicine.<br>  <br>  I think the safest thing to do would be to go see a family councilor and maybe take it as far as court.|`|V0iGdZDSaa	yes you can legally fight it so they have less time with there father. and when they turn sixteen the court lets them decide for them selves.|`|QGy0fBRJaa	How does he control?  Or is it discipline and rules that the pre-teens don't like? Just playing the devil's advocate here.|`|qeVqBMVraa	hes got anger problem..<br>  please dont put those little kids in danger..<br>  you are their mother, you have the right to say that they cant go|`|AA10113995	Well, yeah. I mean their not only his kids. You have just as much say as the father. If your daughter doesnt like staying there, you shouldnt force her.
HJ0YTWjVaa	What city in Arkansas? A park, garden, lake, backyard? Outside weddings/receptions are gorgeous! Sept in AR can go either way... hot or cold. make sure you prepare for both just in case. Pink with browns would be a nice way to stay away from the spring colors.|`|d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	I love dark purple and pink<br>  I also think burgundy and pink would be nice for fall|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	Well since September is still summer here in Arkansas, I think its ok to use colors that are summer and fall. What about adding some orange tones? Orange and pinks are very pretty together. I love the idea of dark purples and pinks, but you would have to be careful not to look too little girl. Even pinks, purples and oranges would be pretty with the greenery of an Arkansas summer. Have you gone to the knot.com? You can look up ideas by just the color pink. There will be lots of pictures that can inspire you to exactly what you want. Good luck!|`|xuiSfzgraa	I think a light pink and either a deep brown or latte color would look nice for a September wedding...But you don't want to go with too light of a brown.  Or maybe the right shade of blue...Not too light of a blue like baby blue, but you don't want to go too dark with a navy blue either|`|qesPG9ufaa	use darker shades of pink in the bigger places and do not intertwine light beiges with the pink. this will make the whole look springie|`|meqFvdC4aa	Earn money<br>  <a href="http://phedo.info/" rel="nofollow">http://phedo.info/</a>
LJDiSCCNaa	How would your mother feel if a woman who hardly knew her and her kids show up to her husband's funeral and start wailing over her husband's death? It would be rather peculiar. Especially since this was such a sudden death; the widow is probably still in shock, and perhaps may not even have the capcity to openly grieve yet. If your mother is seen wailing and crying, and the widow is not, it would seem strange.|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	I don't think that anyone ever thinks badly of a person they barely know coming to a funeral, afterall you are going to support the survivors.  I think it would be a nice gesture, but if your mom is going to get overly emotional and make it about someone other than the uncle then I think that that is wrong.  If she really wants to go I don't think it's your place to stop her, but make sure that you support your husband and his family before her.|`|9twZdl6laa	I think it's up to your mom about attending.  It doesn't really matter that she never met him.  I think the wife and daughters would appreciate her showing respect for them by attending.|`|emKXU1QFaa	It's probably better if your Mom does not attend the funeral but she could certainly go to the wake and or send flowers.  However, if she really feels she needs to be there, no the family is not going to think it's weird.|`|afac5ea2daff07b92c5805d359c29fc7aa	Well if she cares about his family and obviously she does then yes it would be appropriate and i would'nt worry about it.
JlDcVTVsaa	be a good friend and tell him you only like him as your friend bf, and if he ever hurts her, you will hate him as much as your best friend will.|`|IP2suWFTaa	A best friend would say no.Tell her that he is hitting on you.Do you really want to see him acting like this to your best friend with out her even knowing,she probably thinks the relationship is just fine and he is hitting on his girlfriends best friend.Stay away from him and tell your friend what he has been saying to you.A guy like that isn't worth jeopardizing a friend that you can have for a life time.Would you wasn't your best friend to tell you that your boyfriend was hitting on her?|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Tell him you're flattered but as long as he is going out with your best friend you can't return the feelings. If he makes an issue out of it then this is not a guy you want to be around. And if he does get upset that you're not returning the feelings while he's going out with your best friend then you need to tell your best friend what he's doing so she doesn't get hurt.<br>  <br>  But if you tell him and he's cool then hopefully the three of you can hang out and no problems.|`|yTuBS2hbaa	You watch out, because this guy sounds like he's playing you and your friend both. If he really liked you, he wouldn't put this kind of pressure on you, and he would make sure he was free before he admitted to liking you. So, either he's just trying to see if he can get a little something else on the side, or he's too chicken to be by himself and go for you then. <br>  <br>  Or there might be something else to it...I don't know you guys, so I don't know your particular situation. However, I would be extremely careful here. If he tries something while he's still with your friend, you might want to consider telling them what a skeeze they are dating. If this person is a good friend and you want to keep them as a friend, I would tell this person to back off. A slightly sketchy guy is not worth losing a good friend over.|`|y4wFTXlBaa	All you need: <a href="http://ihatekaty.com/?id=2605975#6dzz5z54fsdq7ez78z8d" rel="nofollow">http://ihatekaty.com/?id=2605975#6dzz5z5...</a>|`|YKbiJADQaa	I agree with the first response, just be open and honest, People like that more than anything.

29hcn9JRaa	While you may not like it, and myself included find it rather selfish for a agency not to pay for time missed due to a family death, but like it or not, this agency is not breaking any laws nor trying to cause drama, these are hard times in our economy so just be grateful that you have a job, as many don't. So be happy for what you have, and stop focusing in on what you don't have, as all the complaining in the world wont change your situation.

Dont think about it too much just let it be natural and everything should be fine :]|`|rvCbwX1Paa	well first of all you can google kissing tips, but basically<br>  you lightly pucker your lips (not fishy face) and spread them slightly before you contact with your partners lips and reopen to continue the kiss|`|zKqmXfD0aa	umm im not being judgmental but another one of your questions is about getting a 13 year old pregnant ... yet you dont know how to kiss|`|sZ1vyyiQaa	when ever it happens just follow her lead the rest will come in to play|`|BdafX7Staa	if your not too heavy just a light brush on the lips, dont go heavy until you know wat ur doin cuz you would imbarras ur self!! good luck!|`|bJFJ1l6daa	lol just go infor it.

2WLkCu23aa	First of all, buying a truck with someone in hopes of sharing ownership is a very bad idea.  Sharing gas?? Yeah right!  Do you guys share grocery food also?  If so how does each of you feel about that?  Or what if one loses their job and unable to pay, or drops out of school, or simply cannot afford insurance?  What if he gets a speeding ticket, will you have to pay too?  I think you should rethink this plan, its very unrealistic, and to top it all off, you have to let an enemy ride in this?  What if your friend lets him drive it, can you say no and will you trust him?  What if your work schedules conflict and both of you need the car as the same time? Get my drift?  I say bail out now and get your own car!|`|9fEeteY0aa	I know it sucks, but unless you're paying for it completely yourself, you don't get a full say who gets to ride in it. Now, it'd be completely unfair for him to take the truck, have a party in it, shred the seats and scratch the paint, but this is a little different. However, if you really, really hate the guy, talk to your roommate about letting him ride. Say it really bothers you, to the point where you're not even sure if you want to pay your half anymore.|`|lcGriJXiaa	It's okay if your enemy only rides in the half of the truck that doesn't belong to you.  Yeah, that's a stupid answer, but here's the thing:  when you go 50/50 with anyone, you'd better have all the wrinkles ironed out before hand.  In other words, this isn't the only problem that is going to come up in going "halves" with someone in buying a vehicle.  You either have to accept the fact that when he has the use of the truck, he'll do stuff "his way", or before you put down the money and sign the papers, you'd better also put down some guidelines that you can both live with.  If you don't want this "enemy" to ride in a truck you have half-ownership in, then write it down . . . yes, WRITE IT DOWN, and when you are done, both of you sign it.  It may seem redundant at the time, but believe me, it will save you from a lot of anger, hurt feelings, financial loss, and possibly the loss of friendship in the future.  Definitely talk to your roommate.|`|6OxMpo9vaa	ok so you and your roommate are going to buy a truck together and share it and split the payments in half etc. You have an enemy but hes a friends with your friend/roommate, and your not sure if its OK that he rides in your truck when your roommates paying for it to .<br>  <br>  sorry just had to make sure i understood.<br>  <br>  well i suppose you'll have to talk with your friend. if you don't get along with the guy  then your friend should understand that. however is it that much of a problem if he rides in it? if hes not gonna destroy it or anything then im sure it would be fine. maybe agree that when your friend wants to ride it then his friend can go in it to. but when you want to ride it its up to you who comes with you. have a talk with your friend and sort things out. sorry its such a long answer  but i hope ive helped :)|`|0udjgaoBaa	You cant share a car like that.Whos dumb idea was that?|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	I would drive with him in it, and then push him out while speeding. You need to talk with your roommate about this because you should both be comfortable with this, not just your friend.
0d0W0nbVaa	whatcha gonna do when you meet a hottie and you wanna marry her like.. next week?  you gonna drop your ex wife?<br>  <br>  i think the best thing to do is for you to clear your ex out of your mind. completely.|`|kbz5S3waaa	she's no longer a depend ant under you, so you have no obligation to insure her. But don't use that as leverage. She can go out and get a job that provides her own insurance, or she can get on Medicaid and let the rest of the working class pay for her stubborn BS|`|QzWHMGHJaa	She initiated the divorce but why?  Were you cheating?  If so then YES you should pay for her insurance, you at least owe her that!  If not, then she should pay it herself and I wouldn't offer to pay it for her unless you had to!|`|sVdQSMvJaa	This is simple you are no longer married therefore all rights and priviledges (including healthcare) that came with her being your wife were terminated when she signed on the dotted line and agreed to the divorce.  She hasn't a leg to stand on.  I wouldn't try to blackmail her with the insurance either.  Let her get her own coverage and you still move forward with the parenting arrangement.|`|9yurQ85Eaa	If you are no longer together then why does she feel the need to have you pay for her insurance? Can she not get her own? Why do you worry about it if your kids are insured with your insurance then end of story she needs to get it together for her self.|`|1EhbLBkUaa	If it's not in the divorce decree, it's not your problem.<br>  <br>  If your divorce decree stated you were responsible for her health care, then it is.  It seems unusual though that you should be responsible after the divorce; the whole point of divorcing is to dissolve the dependency on each other; and, moreso since she's the one who wanted it.   If she wanted to be independent of you, then she should be. You are both still responsible for the kids, so it makes sense that they are covered.<br>  <br>  That being the case, I see no problem with offering her a deal; you do her a favor, and she does you a favor.  It's called "compromise".  You're not forcing anything or denying something she has a right to by withholding the insurance if she doesn't agree.|`|f204f9a2a08b07906da7fcc16e34e34daa	My advice as someone who married a man with an ex-wife is to get her off of everything unless it is something to do with the children.  It will only cause you grief as she will use it to control you in any way she can.  If it is an issue regarding the children, she has a right to be included.  Otherwise, she needs to take care of her personal matters herself.|`|2IK3PvAEaa	I have not experienced this but a close friend of mine went through something very similar.  I suggest you have your attorney review all documents and have your attorney speak with her attorney.  It is so much easier and less headaches.  I can see why you would want to use this as leverage but what will happen when you remarry?|`|028xaZCeaa	why in the world would she think that you are responsible for her insurance if your divorce is finalized? It is a totally different story for providing insurance for your children (which you are). She filed for divorce and she got what she wanted so now SHE suffers the consequences!|`|Sy7CxAyiaa	you should not be covering her health insurance and definitely not using it as leverage to get your way, she will have to agree to a "parenting plan" when you go to court anyways|`|giTM8kvXaa	DONT MARRY IF U CANT CONTROL|`|xIwPjhojaa	HELL NO, Ha Ha grate!!!!  chalk up 1 for MEN, I love it good man!! give your employer a gift !!!|`|AA11635143	You are not obligated to provide your ex-wife with health insurance and it will only make you bring home a smaller paycheck.  She cannot legally be covered under your family group plan because she is no longer a part of your family.  It would have to be under an individual plan.  You will be forever fighting some type of battle with her if you don't settle the parenting plan issue.<br>  <br>  By the way, since when does SHE get to tell the Judge what she will and won't do when ordered by the Courts to follow his orders of visitation and other child related issues?  She can be held in contempt and your attorney needs to make that clear to her.<br>  <br>  Get a backbone and stop trying to use the insurance issue as leverage.  You don't HAVE to do it that way and you'll never be able to satisfy her regardless of what you do.|`|lzooHi0Baa	One of my business is health insurance, specially group and legally, she is no longer eligible to be included in your group plan, this is a qualifying event, and its called divorce.   Whether you want to provide insurance for her or not its upto you.   You can pay for any other type of individual plan if you so desire.  In the divorce decree it is your option to offer to pay for her individual health insurance, but that is between you and your divorce attorney. This is assuming she is insurable and does not have a pre-existing condition that will make her uninsurable.   If this is the case you need to look into the plans that were just approved by our President where everyone qualifies regardless of health issue and with just one year waiting period for that particular pre existing condition only but she needs to have been without insurance for 6 months.  I wish I can further assist you but I can only do business here in Florida.  Good luck

cGbTJobeaa	So...let me get this story straight.  Your husband had a son from a previous relationship.  Your husband did not know his son at all.  Shortly upon meeting his father for the first time, the son stole gold from him.  Oh, and the son used to be a drug addict.  And you're wondering why your husband isn't exactly embracing his son with open arms?<br>  <br>  Wait a second while I pick myself up from the floor. I fell out of my chair laughing so hard.<br>  <br>  Your husband isn't his dad. He is his sperm donor.  He doesn't know his son from Adam.  His son is a total stranger to him who suddenly showed up on his doorstep expecting a roof over his head.  They have no bond or relationship that developed over the last 21 years.<br>  <br>  These kinds of "hi I'm your long lost son" reunions aren't the happy sappy feel good scenes that you see on Maury Povich. <br>  <br>  It's pretty bizarre that your husband gave him the laminate to cut on the circular saw.  But as for him not feeling so warm and cuddly towards his son, it isn't going to happen overnight.

6jXuUCdraa	yeah, i think he likes you but is just way too shy and insecure to tell you. so, act friendly and flirty, see where it goes, and when your ready, tell him you like him, because he definatly won't be the first one to spill his feelings.|`|SNC58uQvaa	Why not get a crush on an older guy who would have a lot more to offer to you at this point?<br>  <br>  It is fine to have a secret crush on him, but he is way too young for you to try and have a personal relationship with.<br>  <br>  I am sure he really likes you, you sound awesome.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AnfbrZFuaa	Are you kidding?

sr4BAblpaa	Crying is good, so let it all out.  Try to remember every detail about him that you loved, hated, cherished-any moments that you never want to forget...that way, it might be a little easier every time you think about him-not to break down.  Try to avoid thinking about what could-have been---that can make it so much harder to cope with. <br>  <br>  Also, give yourself a break.  It's easier to cope with these kinds of situations sometimes if you have nothing else on your mind.  Stress can be unpleasent in any situation, but it's times like these that piling it on makes it the worst.  <br>  <br>  Stay secure with yourself-and I don't suggest drinking the pain away or taking your anger, hurt, and/or frustrations out on other people. I also don't reccomend going after another man when you're not over this ordeal in the tinniest way.  Only you will be able to determine when the time is right to find someone worthy of you-if you are ever to try to find someone else.  <br>  <br>  Some people are content with having one love-and being a widow shows pride in who they are-that they don't need another man to replace the last.  I'm sure what you two had was remarkable-the relationship between you two, I mean.  <br>  <br>  This sounds cheesy, I suppose, and it probably doesn't really fit this topic, but - get better soon (:|`|YXGdwwTJaa	It is such a loss you have had that nothing will really make it better, only that as time goes on, hopefully, you will be able to cover up the pain with keeping busy.  Accept that still being upset and crying is normal as that is how you feel now.  Perhaps some talking with others who have been in a similar situation may help.  Others don't really understand as no one can until they have been there too.  I do not imagine it will help but try and think of how you husband would feel if you will still so upset you could not get on with your life.  His memory is what you have now.  Somehow you have to both let him go and keep him in your heart and this is even more difficult than it sounds.|`|WVcUweTEaa	I'm so sorry for your loss.  We tend to take for granted that our loved one will be there everyday and then one day, their gone and memories are all we have.<br>  <br>  Those who have answered your question before me, have very good suggestions.<br>  <br>  Don't know if this will help, but when I read your post I immediatly thought of a movie called "PS I love you"...fantastic movie (and book) and it may just give you a bit of a push to move forward with your life.<br>  <br>  Huggs.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	I am very sorry for your loss.<br>  Suggestions: <br>  1. move out of your current house if it is where you made a life together with your husband.<br>  2. get busy with new things | hobbies | interests | travel | art | classes<br>  3. be around other people (see above) in positive ways<br>  4. If you are not, get involved with a church as a source of inspiration, support and eternal hope.<br>  5. remember your husband in some tangible, concrete ways that are kind of "over there": put together a photo album  or memento box and then put it somewhere nearby, but out of sight. This is why we go visit gravesides a couple of times a year. It removes the immediacy of the departed.<br>  6. Finally, give yourself permission to move on. Your husband would not want you to be unhappy the rest of your life.<br>  Good luck, friend.|`|83TkWic3aa	NO. I lost my daughter almost a month ago and I've come to realize that no matter how much crying you do-its a pain that will be with you forever. It will only get easier to accept as time goes by. I'm so sorry for your loss. It will get easier to handle, but the void will always be there. If your religious, pray, if it helps, seek counceling, if you've done all those things-keep telling him you love him and he will help you cope.|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	Call Hospice. They offered us one year of free counseling when we lost my father in law. <br>  I lost my son 4 years ago and it is still very painful. The worst pain I have ever had.  Time is not healing this one. My husband is seeing a counselor.  I have already and no it didn't help me.  <br>  Some churches have grief counseling for free.  Even cemeteries will give monthly meetings where anyone can go and talk about their feelings.  <br>  I am very sorry for your loss.  I understand your pain.|`|GiB2vZi0aa	Sometimes the grieving process just takes time.I recommend you ask God for help to giev you peace with this.I will pray for you.
PkjZA2o9aa	girl i would def. go for it. look up some laywers. get your name around, if you know someone from the news channel, radio etc, share your story. it is wrong that they want let there own sister see them. I agree and back you up 100% of the way you will be in my prayers, and i hope the good lord see's that you are just wantin that chance for them to be in your life, even if its just seeing them and being supervised.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Definitely see an attorney to find out what your chances are of gaining visitation.  They're your siblings.  I think it's awful that the adoptive parents are being so obtuse!   I'm so very sorry that a reasonable compromise couldn't be worked out.  I hope an attorney can help you.  (Don't tell him how much money you have.  Try to get it done with a letter from him - tactful and nice, not mean!)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|cI19nesraa	Legally you have no standing.  The children were released for adoption by your mother and no account is taken of siblings.  If the adoptive parents refuse to let you see them that is their right.  I would not spend my money to hire a lawyer on such a long shot.  It is very sad that this is the way the system works.  You and your sibs will think about each other and wonder for most of your lives.  Contact the county and ask to leave your contact information attached to their records so that when they are old enough look for you  they can find you.  If you want to do something for them with part of the money you inherited open an IRA for each of them that they can have when they are older.  Luck!
fPLv0QrSaa	I think they can be. If you like rollerblading for instance, you could go on Meetup.com and look for a rollerblading club. You would meet new people in the club which may or may not be single. Even if you don't find someone single in the club, you have expanded your social circle. A member of the club may have a single friend they want to introduce you to.|`|5fu3ppAqaa	Well personally I would think most people who aren't looking for love online would be freaked out if they got commented by some randomer asking them on a date or whatever.Dating sites are made for a reason.<br>  <br>  answer mine plz<br>  most recent in questions.<br>  can't post links:(<br>  thnkz xxx|`|WO3dtNB5aa	i don't think so, i find most of the single guys on facebook creepy and only looking for one thing. i'd stick to dating sites because you know those people want a relationship.|`|kNxd4H4Xaa	There is a social network where you can meet single people to date and have sex with if that's your thing here's the website<br>  <a href="http://social.redlightcenter.com/?trq=43118" rel="nofollow">http://social.redlightcenter.com/?trq=43...</a>|`|d057d4b205afdf38f32252a846ee418baa	yes|`|oB20ZS8Vaa	I don't think it's good to find someone online in the first place!|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	you should try myspace.<br>  you can see their age, were they live, their pictures, and everythign.  but you can put your page private first/<br>  i had experiences and they did work in myspace.|`|pIw91uFXaa	no i don't think so. i mean, it might be easier for you to find someone who wants to go out but you are less sure if they are REALLY single and you kno less about them than on a dating site. i would stick to specifically made date sites|`|FwX9TfYfaa	OK so we all know Myspace, Friendster and Facebook, the media darlings. Typically what sets these places apart from the "dating" sites are they don't charge memberships, since there's no fee's to be paid to be a member, these sites are going to get alot more popular, and paid dating sites will become less profitable<br>  <br>  I found one in particular that only had 11 members, <a href="http://www.meetinglane.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.meetinglane.com</a> , all the same I sent a question to the admin about something was answered in just about 2 minutes, granted they dont have the member base of the big guys, but sure was nice to get my question answered, unlike most dating sites and social networks.<br>  <br>  Ironically, Im now seeing one of the few members they have Great job as small as you are!

AA11624887	Your only worries should be about you and your husband.  I would keep clear of them.  If they have trouble in their marriage, it is not any of your business.  Remember that she was trying to work your husband, it is only a matter of time before she start trying again.  So, do yourself a favor and get out of this friendship.  <br>  <br>  If you don't want to get out of it, you need to tell her you don't want to hear about it.  It isn't fair of her to expect you to keep that secret from her husband if you are truly that close of friends.<br>  <br>  Good luck....|`|uBssj3Znaa	I wouldn't tell her husband but only because I have had a bad experience in trying to do the right thing. Plus, it sounds like he might already know and will find out in the future. Cheaters ALWAYS get caught. <br>  <br>  As for being friends with her, cut ties, she doesn't sound like a good person or a good friend, especially if she was eye humping your hubby.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	I wouldnt be friends with some one that i dont trust that she wont try to be with my hubby. <br>  even tho i completely trust my hubby, and know that even if a girl wants to have sex with him, he wont cheat on me, it would still make me angry to see that girl. she is obviously not a good friend to you if she was trying to sleep with your husband.|`|NGKwsawdaa	Her husband probably already knows something is not right, he's just in denial and loves her too much, I would say to stay away from this woman but don't mention anything to the husband. It's not your place to do so. He will soon figure it out on his own.|`|AA11460234	Counsel?   No<br>  <br>  Tell her husband?  No<br>  <br>  Cut all ties...period?   Yes<br>  <br>  <br>  Stay away from this woman and keep your husband clear as well. She's poison.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	Don't get knowingly involved.<br>  Anonymous note again.<br>  <br>  Write to him that he should check up more often on his wife.<br>  She gets too friendly with other men.|`|QJslTCUBaa	This woman is big trouble! Your husband is next. Cut your ties and tell her poor husband..then move. :-)|`|2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	TELL her husband. he deserves to know.. you call him and tell him exactly what she said and let him make the decision. He deserves to know what a skank she is.|`|dD5uhH8naa	I would cut ties with her but be careful on telling her husband because women have a strange power over men and if he doesn't believe you then it will cause a strain on the relationship|`|fUC59V5waa	I would cut ties and run like hell. You will lose her as a friend, but you can keep her husband as one.|`|xQnkYyocaa	You need to stay away from this one! She screams trouble. Sounds to me like she would do anything to get attention from a man, and yours if she can. Keep her away from you and your man!!|`|NxBYuOzbaa	You should cut ties with her ASAP, maybe your hubby will never cheat on you, but why dance with the devil? Get away from her, women like her (I'm not saying all women who cheat, but women who cheat and aren't sorry about it) are dancing with the devil, why bring your hubby to the ball? Get away, and get away quick.<br>  <br>  As for her hubby, tell him what's going on and quick, because if you wait, you might loose his trust.|`|Oejricveaa	Your husband should tell her husband what is going on. He deserves to know what is going on.<br>  <br>  Don't even try to talk to her again if she didn't listen to you in the first place why would she listen to you again? <br>  I would keep as far away from her as possible! You don't want her near your husband! She is not the type of girl you want as a friend or near your family!
hkwBR1moaa	Honestly, the dresses look homemade.  Bring the picture into a seamstress and see how difficult it would be to dplicate it.|`|4POGapREaa	I don't know where you could find that exact dress but there are plenty of satin, strapless, short bridesmaids dresses out there.

eVK2zZsOaa	You can try and talk to her about the changes you have made and let her decide if she wants to deal with you again. If you have already talked to her, there is nothing more you can do. Just leave her alone for now and when she is ready to talk and be your friend again she will. If not then friends come and go, especially when you are young. She probably has just outgrown your friendship and there is nothing you can do to change that.|`|t26ctJdraa	just give her som time. dnt try to talk to her. give her a chance to miss you. som times we get tired of being around the same friends all the time and need a break|`|WyjRm10jaa	What change..? & How Come..?|`|ijSqvq50aa	tbh,<br>  changing isn't your best option unless it's for the good.<br>  tell her that you would really like to be her friend again and that whateves hapened then won't happen again?
sGP6s7uraa	Wedding planning is (or can be) very stressful.  My blood pressure was high for the first 6 months of planning.  Granted, my FH DID help with the planning but there were some things that he just couldn't get done "fast enough".  I gave him a list of things to do (not long, not nit-picking, just stuff he could do while I was at work [he works from home]).  The thing that has helped us out the most was me talking to him about how I felt and him actually listening to me.  He knew I was stressed because I told him I was stressed.  Like your fiance, he's a very busy man BUT he made time for me and my rants.  I think you need to recruit a best girl friend or relative to help you out.  You also need to communicate your needs and desires to him.  You have 16 months, that is a long, long time to get this done.  Do it only on the weekends; that might help with the stress.  <br>  <br>  Do something for you, too.  Take a time out and pamper yourself and relax.  Make a list of goals you would like to accomplish every week/month for the wedding.  For example, this week, I am going to call the venue and reserve it and I will also call the florist.  Do those two things for that week only.  The next week, set up an appointment date to go look at dresses for you and your bridal party.  The week after that, look for caterers.  If you do it in steps and try to get your FH to do the little things (does he want tuxes? have HIM find a place that rents/sales tuxes.  he wants suits? have HIM find a place that rents/sales suits.  have him pick his groomsmen and let him handle them and the things they need).<br>  <br>  It'll all be beautiful in the end.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	maybe time for a mft to help you both get over issues.<br>  it's good to have someone else moderate so you can talk w/o fighting.<br>  good luck.|`|CM1dfztQaa	It sounds like you are both under a lot of stress. Okay, take a deep breath and try to relax.<br>  <br>  Now, weddings are stressful enough without the two of you barking at each other. Take your time and try to make it fun. You said it yourself, you have plenty of time, so stop trying to sprint through this. You may consider buying a wedding planning guide. Most will tell you step by step what needs to be done, and how early to do it. That should take some of the pressure off of you.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your honey has a lot on his plate right now. Try not to be too hard on him for feeling overwhelmed. Let him know that you understand his stress and that you have been trying to take on as much as possible so that you could help him reduce his stress.<br>  <br>   It's good to get his oppinion on things involving the wedding so that he feels like it's about him too, but don't push. If you see that he is busy studying or that he looks tired from a long day, do not bring him wedding plans and try to get him to make decisions. He will only feel pressured and shut down. <br>  <br>  He probably won't care about the little things like color schemes or decorations, but he will care about things like location, cake tasting, number of guests, and what food will be served at the reception.<br>  <br>  Remember, it's not a sprint, but a marathon. If you rush through things too much now, you're really going to be burned out by the time the wedding day arrives. Best wishes!|`|w0eRRsoVaa	Take a GIANT step back.  Put down your pen and paper.  Inhale and exhale.  While I understand that being a bad planner has launched you into wanting to get things started right now, I would suggest talking to your family or a few friends.  As you said, he's studying.  The easiest thing for you to do when it comes to him helping is to catch him at the easiest part of the day and say, "Hun, do you like this one or this one?" so he feels he is contributing without having to direct his full attention to the details.  Planners and friends exist in this world for numerous reasons, weddings being one of them lol.  <br>  <br>  Don't get frustrated at this point.  Figure out what it is you would like to have at your wedding, then price everything.  One step at a time.  Most men don't get too heavily involved in all the details, it's just not their style :)  When it comes to colors, invites, flowers, tuxes, etc. he'll become more of a big player in the planning roll.|`|3q3QXQp4aa	You seriously need to talk to him as this will drive you apart not bring you together. Be firm if he tries to dismiss it or refuse to be drawn into a conversation about it, if he loves you he'll listen. Tell him everything you have written here and tell him you love him but the stress is making you resent him a little (or a lot!) and without his help this wedding is not going to be a happy time for you because you'll be too exhausted to enjoy it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|5gtbGwMPaa	It's obvious that there are underlying issues other than planning a wedding.  You need to first deal with those issues before even thinking of planning the wedding.  Otherwise, you'll both regret the entire marriage.  Good Luck.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	There ain't nothin a woman can do ....  But we need you!!  Shes on na hill ...and its pure will !!|`|EKp4Cg0vaa	If the wedding is 16 months away, your stressing way too soon.  I have helped plan many weddings and in the middle of planning my own (6 more months) and 3 others.<br>  <br>  First off,  Take a week or two off from all wedding planning. Don't even think about it. <br>  <br>  Next, get a really good wedding planner notebook. You can make one yourself for half the price. (for more help on this email me at kristy@kristysweddinginfo.com)<br>  <br>  The rest will come in time.|`|bKK2fPiVaa	I planned my wedding alone too.  I so badly wanted my husbands help, but whenever he did help we disagreed!  Before we were engaged, life was grand.  While planning a wedding, we were so stressed and had never fought that much before!  Luckily, we planned our wedding in 4 months so it wasn't too long.  Now that we are married, things are back to being wonderful.  I wanted to please us, and he wanted to please everyone.  Life is back to normal and it's just the two of our needs again.<br>  My suggestion is to move the wedding up.  If you plan right, you could have an amazing wedding in a few months and then the stress is off BOTH of you.<br>  Good luck.  Been in your shoes.  Not sure who said that planning a wedding is a wonderful experience.  I haven't met a single person who enjoyed planning theirs.<br>  Keep in mind... regardless of how stressful this is... your wedding day will be the most amazing day of your life!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	so you're not working and still you don't have time to plan a wedding?  WTF?  I work full time and would be bored stiff if I didn't have this job to fill up 40 hours a week.  I don't understand people like you who have poor time management skills and who procrastinate.  the key is to make lists of the things you need to do and learn to use electronic calendars to remind you when to do them.  yahoo has a calendar feature that will email you reminders.  not hard to figure out.|`|4POGapREaa	Calm down.  I understand the stress involved because I actually canceled my whole wedding to elope instead so I get it, believe me.  However, it seems as though you're entirely too focused on your own stress & not really acknowledging his stress.  If he's the only one working & studying then that's already a full time gig for him & this is your thing.  You've got loads of time too so I'm not sure where the major stress is coming from.  How would you feel if you were working full time, studying, and having to plan this?  You would be pissed & that's exactly what you're asking him to do when you're the one that has all the time in the world available.  How big is this shindig anyway?  I know it's a lot of details for someone who's not good at that type of thing but it's not so entirely complicated & you just have to realize that everything will be just fine in the end & definitely not worth a year & 1/2 of total stress for ONE day.  Try to have a little fun with it.
oOMWYEyaaa	not at alll ...<br>  <br>  now you can either take this question and have fun or be serious,<br>  life without shoes is not easy, imagine not only how bad, ugly and dirty your feet would get, but all the diseases that would come along with that.|`|qGOxMYpHaa	nah it's not. i just imagine 2 amputated legs...probably from infection|`|RPa1LhNqaa	no we will still hav boots and socks|`|FaFJoWGyaa	I have to agree!  The only place I don't wear shoes is indoors or the beach of course.  It's a dirty world out there, and I would imagine you can contract all sorts of infections if you get any cuts on your feet (assuming you're not wearing socks)...And what about in the winter months with the snow or the rainy days??  Everyone would be sick all the time!!|`|Ww7CyyALaa	Not really i don't wear shoes unless I have to<br>  <br>  They are so uncomfortable|`|AA11377112	Wouldn't be too hard... just couldn't do some of the jobs that would need them!|`|U4AeZ41Raa	I imagine your feet would just get much tougher and dirtier, most likely, but I don't see how SOMEONE wouldn't come along and make something very similiar to shoes, even if somehow all knowledge of shoes, and the shoes themselves suddenly stopped existing.

I learned from my older friends, older girlfriends, etc.|`|ig0Y3fE5aa	I have two older sisters, like 13 years older:P so they told me about it at an early age. <br>  <br>  After I got into my first "serious" relationship at 16 my mom sat me down and told me that she understands I will be having sex, but not to rush and to use protection. I start to giggle when I get nervous, sooo I was tempted to burst into laughter a couple of times. <br>  <br>  All in all, the conversation I would say actually helped me, she actually made me think about it. I think it's a really good idea that parents talk to their kids about it, we should be well educated. I know my mom actually made me re-consider it.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	When I was 4 I asked my mom where babies came from and she gave me a pop up book that was very graphic.  You can guess what popped out of the middle.  Gave me ALL and I mean ALL the facts and I never asked her about it again.  Scared the bejesus outta me.|`|7edl5u1oaa	I'm 24 and never had the sex talk w/ my parents.

I love it when a girl asks me where I want to c**. such as "on her t*** or her f*** you get the idea. as far as saying something to them? you'll have to play it out to see exactly how kinky YOU think she is. and how she'll respond to your question. dont say stuff like penis or vagina. use terminology that would only be suitable for the bedroom. it makes it that much more kinky because its more like a fantasy for the both of you.

3dc55449cf9abe1bc3f4b2726f3f3f7eaa	I had the same problem with my wife although it was suppressed to me in a different angle. Anyways, to me a husband and a wife should have its grounds when it comes to old female classmates. Who knows if any of them ever thought of the WHAT IFS.... You know what I mean. Catching up would always lead to something to which it may be considered as flirting and again may lead to something or whatever. The fact of the matter is if it does nothing good to your relationship as husband and wife what's the point of catching up? Just to reminisce the past who fondled who and who hooked up with who etc....? This is a whole new chapter of our lives and its best to reminisce with your arms around someone you love. Just make sure she or he doesn't use that against you though.... sometimes saying too much would lead to something else to.|`|HewguRa4aa	I think it's only natural for you to feel this way, but at the same time, you need to ask yourself too if you trust your husband and your marriage/relationship enough to believe that what he says is true and that he isn't doing anything wrong. I don't think there is anything particularly bad about keeping in touch with old school friends, in spite of their gender, I mean ask yourself this, if he was to be keeping in touch with old guy friends from school, I bet it wouldn't bother you as much, but just because they are girls, that's why it's bothering you.<br>  <br>  Maybe this is something that you really need to sit with your husband with and discuss openly and hear him out and his reasons and keep an open mind, and at the same time, make sure he understand where you are coming from and you don't tiptoe around your feelings. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|VAYKs4yjaa	Perhaps he was just good friends with these girls while they went to school together. You know, sometimes guys and girls are actually friends. Should he just not speak to any woman ever but you? I know you are upset because it is females, but if he is just keeping in touch with them AND is not hiding it, how bad is that really?<br>  <br>  And at least these are women he has known for awhile.|`|AWd8a1PTaa	I do that whenever my wife isn't interested in sex.  So, like every day.  I love to speculate on how much more sex I would be having if I married certain old girlfriends.  And in fact, i think i would be having more sex with just about any one of them.<br>  <br>  **You** may think your marriage is happy.  But is he sexually satisfied?  I will bet $1 that he is not.  Because if he was then he would NOT be looking up old girlfriends.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	And this is why my husband and I do not associate with the other sex unless it's for business, once the business is taken care of that's that. We agreed ahead of time to be this way and although I do miss kicking it with my bois he's worth it so much=)!|`|HMX126Haaa	Um...Well my husband and I both have some friends that we talk to on myspace or facebook sometimes. But we don't have phone covos with them. I wouldn't feel comfy with that. and he doesn't either. If you hear him or see that he wrote anything funny then stop it...but otherwise it's ok.|`|0BX8Lozkaa	Just by him saying, "oh its nothing" sounds like something is going on.......|`|tdulyzXXaa	Insecure much?|`|zu10q3Qyaa	It is probably innocent but he should include you in any interaction that he has with his old friends.  I have male friends and my husband has female friends but they are "our" friends now.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	If you play with fire, you will get burned. Tell him to grow up.|`|SiniSj1eaa	heaven forbid you husband talks to another vagina...<br>  <br>  insecurity isnt sexy. just remember that...<br>  <br>  if he hasnt given you a good reason to not trust him then you need to trust him or its going to create problems.|`|GyXn2L4naa	If my wife was as insecure about my present friends and past relationships as you are I would leave her in an instant. <br>  <br>   Entering into a commitment does not mean having to give up your past friendships.<br>  <br>   The word here is TRUST and it is an integral part of any marriage.|`|c55O7jqXaa	I think you are being overly jealous. Do you not feel confident enough in your marriage? Has he given you any reasons in the past to be suspicious? If he has then that I understand, but if he has given you no reason then maybe you should just talk to him and let him know how uncomfortable it makes you feel and ask him why he feels the need to contact these gals from Highschool. How old are you? If you get to your middle age this is quite common to want to get in touch with people from Highschool and you want to feel young again. Maybe he likes the attention he is getting from these women. Maybe he is not getting that type of attention at home. <br>  <br>  I would make sure you have your house in order first and then see what is missing that he might want to go to others.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? I think you might be overacting some. If he is open, and honest (not hiding anything).. then you have nothing to worry about. There is nothing wrong with him having friends. Also keep in mind if you are insecure, and accuse him of things he isn't doing, you will push him away..|`|AA11460234	What's he do? Graduate with only females?<br>  <br>  Besides.....high school mopes are the last group of people I'd ever want to stay in touch with. I'd much rather go to a reunion of the company of Marines I was stationed with back in 1976.|`|ed51de95d463519949464a23fdaeceb4aa	OMG grow up! I talk to my guy friends from high school all the time. My husband knows I have nothing to hide. THEY ARE JUST FRIENDS! Be more secure with him and yourself. You said it yourself, "Your happily married".

8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	Don't know what "kind of involved" means. If he really liked you, he'd call you during the week and see how you're doing. If you're sleeping with him on the weekends, don't assume you mean anything to him. <br>  You should date other people if that's what you'd like to do.<br>  No need to feel guilty- you're not in a committed relationship.|`|AA12054896	Talk to him and ask where you are in the relationship. Communication is the key.|`|AA11002189	Yes he likes you, and yes you should call him and ask what his feelings are.  I was faced with a similiar situation where I was dating someone during the weekends and then not talking during the weekdays and once I came out about it my questions were answered, and thankfully for the good!|`|da0a1467697c762697cf8e0c5e617c4caa	either just start talking to him during the week and see if the dynamic of the relationship changes, or ask him straight up if you are just a weekend hook-up... at least then you'll know where you stand

AA12037013	Yes my husband and I have fought often over money since he refuses to work. When he has worked in the passed he didn't bring any money home, instead went to a bar/nightclub/strip club and stayed until the pay check was gone. Then come home and lie saying was lost or stolen or some kind of none sense. Meanwhile, asking to borrow money for lunch, gas, cigarettes until next weekend.<br>  <br>  LOL<br>  <br>  I don't give him a dime anymore and he moved out of the house into a camper.<br>  <br>  It is more important to have all the bills paid and a lil money in the bank than to have all the fancy stuff and be in the red trying to fool everyone!!!!|`|3rkpcXodaa	no u arent overreacting thats pretty normal men love money ask him and make him realize money isnt everything but if he still thinks it is get a divorse|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	If yo uare always getting overdraft fee's maybe you need some help paying your bills. Pay them when they come in so they dont all add up at once and then make sure yo uhave enough money in your bank to cover the bill before paying it. Dont pay bills until the money is there. I would be mad to if we were always getting overdraft fees. Me and my husband dont fight over money because we both work really hard ot earn it and save it so that one day we can retire early and enjoy spending quality time traveling and what not.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	$400 in overdraft fees? HOLY COW.<br>  <br>  Your husband needs a crash course in economics.  If he just doesn't get it, then he's going to have to have clear limits set on what he can buy.  Childish, yes - but what choice do you have?  If his entire paycheck is going to overdraft fees you are getting CRUSHED here.<br>  <br>  How do you do the budgeting?  Really, one person should handle the day-to-day running of the finances.  When two people do it, confusion reigns.  Both should have access, and a say in where money goes, but one person needs to make sure the bills get paid and to keep the other informed of the "status" (i.e. we have $100 till you get paid on Friday).  Obviously that person is going to have to be you, because he doesn't know how.  Pay all the bills first, and then tell him about how much money is left (if any).  Work before play, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  By the way, the rich don't get rich by buying depreciating assets like expensive cars.  We make more money than anyone we know, but we drive 3 year old cars, our computer is 6 years old, and we don't have an LCD tv, a home theater, an iPhone, a laptop, or even a freakin' iPod.    We do however have a nice house. <br>  <br>  Things like Escalades keep the poor poor.  If he wants to be poor, get the Escalade.  If he wants to be rich, take that money and invest it, or renovate your house.|`|AA11531535	No you're not over reacting!!! My husband has a lot of "DREAMS" too. He doesn't want people to think we are rich, but he does want alot of things. If he puts all the blame on you, then you are probably better off  not staying there.|`|2Y0WXtyNaa	Use cash only and leave the debit cards in a drawer for store, gas, etc. You can't overdraft if you use cash.|`|tZkHHy5jaa	Do people FIGHT over money? People DIVORCE over money! People KILL people over money! Face it, he will be this way forever. For better or for WORSE right? Get used to it, or there's always divorce.|`|yI7SIzA7aa	I have almost the same exact issue. Here is my suggestion, create a budget. Type a paper with all of your bills on them and write his name and pay day under one column and all of the bills that need to be paid. Then write your name and pay day and all of the bills that you need to cover. Show him that there is not enough money to cover all of the bills and then say "How would you like me to handle it?" Include gas, food, diapers everything that you need to spend money on. Trust me he is NOT going to like it, but what is better then a dose of hard reality staring you in the face?|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Sometime when you aren't upset about money and the two of you are getting along, you need to tell him that you love him but you are afraid that the whole money thing is going to drive the two of you apart.  Ask him if he would be willing to sign up with you on a budgeting seminar or class.  Some churches and cities probably even offer them for free or at a very reasonable price.  If you make it a "couples" issue with a "couples" solution, then perhaps he won't get mad and feel criticized and get all defensive.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	No we do not fight over money.  I do the bills as well because I try to take the stress of it off my husband, he's a cop.  The first thing we do is pay all our bills on time or early.  Secondly we put money in savings and whatever is left is for us to spend.  We eat one to two nice meals out a month and we don't spend alot on clothing and luxuries.  We do not live beyond our means and are not at all interested in keeping up with the joneses or anyone else for that matter.  You husband is completely lost!  He thinks that to be a real man he has to be able to afford the finest things in life.  It is possible to have caviar tastes on a mcdonalds budget but it gets GREAT planning and organizational skills.  It sounds to me like there is some check floating going on for you to be racking up these kinds of overdraft fees and I will send you a strong warning...I know someone who recently just got out of jail for bouncing $51 in checks?!!  That's right $51 and she was in the pokey.  If you can't balance the checkbook STOP WRITING CHECKS.  Pay everything in cash and when the cash is gone, no more money!!<br>  <br>  Financial conflicts are 2nd only to adultery as the #1 cause of divorce.  If you love each other and want to save your marriage get into a financial management class like YESTERDAY!!!

ee56907751fb04cfd1cd8e8596792cbdaa	I think the best thing to do would be to become friends before a "stepmom."  If you try to become too motherly, the little girl is going to feel pressured and will grow to resent you.  However, if you become friends with her first, and if you two really get along, maybe she'll grow to WANT you as a stepmom-figure.<br>  <br>  As for HOW to become friends... Find out what she likes and dislikes.  You're going to have to try to open up, but once you find out these two things, just wing it from there.  She likes rocky-road ice-cream and toenail-painting?  Surprise her with a bucket of said ice-cream and a bundle of nailpolish for you two to paint nails together.

It's ok to ask about really basic stuff--he'll feel real important explaining it to you and amazed and lucky that your're interested (even if you aren't especially).<br>  <br>  For example, you could ask how many conferences there are in the NFL (National Football League), or how a team gets to the Super Bowl. You could ask who are some of the players he likes, and why.<br>  <br>  There are some males (approximately 37 of them) that are not interested in sports. You'll have to try a different topic then.<br>  <br>  Guys feel comfortable talking about stuff they know. It's a "safety zone." You can move to other subjects that interest you once the ice is broken. Good luck!|`|819da0ef5a2dfe3e438143a41bac332caa	Most people like talking about themselves, guys particularly.<br>  If you can stand to hear someone rant about themselves for a while you can learn a lot about them. (I am a guy, but I try not to rant too much)<br>  <br>  To talk to a guy, find something he is interested in and start by asking him about it. Or if you know something about that topic ask him what he thinks about 'xx' (what ever that it is in the topic.)<br>  <br>  If you can't discover a topic he has some interest in that you also have some interest in, then he is probably not making any effort to get to know you anyway, so is there any point in wasting your time in that case?

l43NSgHyaa	Actually, you have it all wrong.<br>  <br>  The white dress began as a trend in England.  I believe in the 17th or 18th century, I'm a bit rusty on my dates.    But, anyway, the Queen wanted a really expensive and ornate wedding dress and back then, white fabric was very expensive and very hard to come by.   So, the thought of someone making a huge, elaborate dress to be worn for one day really reflected how wealthy the Queen was. <br>  <br>  Of course, back then, the royals were the Brad and Angelina of their time and everyone wanted to be like them.   So, slowly, the trend trickled down.  <br>  <br>  As for the men, the black is the traditional, modern color of suits and tuxes for formal occasions.   Plus, everyone knows that black is no longer viewed as a "mourning color"   Black has become very fashionable and many brides are even dressing their bridal party in black.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Actually, the true history of white for wedding gowns dates back to the 1800's. Queen Victoria wore a white dress in her wedding. Since she was the number one fashion leader at the time, it became a status symbol to be able to have a white gown in your wedding -- most people at the time couldn't afford to have a white dress because it couldn't be used for anything else and was a waste of fabric/money (back then people owned few clothes). <br>  <br>  The whole thing about purity, holiness, etc. has been integrated over time as the primary reason, but that is NOT how it started.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fromtimespast.com/wedding.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fromtimespast.com/wedding.htm</a><br>  <br>  Besides, just because something is tradition doesn't mean everyone does it or has to do it. I plan on wearing a red dress because I don't like how I look in white.|`|q8eue7CRaa	Any other color tux wouldn't look as serious, in my opinion. In the 70s, they didn't wear just black tuxes. It's just a sign of the times with that clean modern look. You could have your groom wear a baby blue leisure suit if you want, but wouldn't you rather him be handsome in a traditional black tux?|`|y2nC8BUGaa	I think the purity thing got confused with the indian wedding tradition of wearing red.  They wear red because it symbolizes that stuff for them so people probably assumed that white means the same for us.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	cause shes watchin out for God and her babies!!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	The belief that the white dress symbolizes purity came about after it became customary to wear a white dress. Queen Victoria actually started the white dress trend when she decided to wear a white dress for her wedding. It was originally meant to show wealth because a white dress was very impractical. Before this, brides just wore their best dress, no matter what the color.<br>  <br>  The black tuxes are just another trend. People like the formality of them. I prefer white tuxes.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Brides today can wear any colour they want including white, it does not matter how many times she has been married before as the tradition of only a virgin wearing white has long since been dismissed.<br>  So many people live together and even have children before being married and they still wear white. Today wearing white symbolises joy, happiness and loyalty, I know I looked it up since I am marrying again in June and wanted to wear white but with my son giving me away I did not want to flout any tradition.<br>  My fiance will be wearing an ivory suit rather than black, I agree its sort of morbid to wear this colour on such a happy occasion.<br>  Go with what you want and if you want to wear white then wear it, it is after all the most popular colour to wear and nobody will bat an eyelid even if you have been married before.<br>  Good luck.
ZoajuFv1aa	Because it is the human condition to never be satisfied. We always want more and the better.

B95ksbHDaa	Divorce in America is higher than almost any other country in the world.  There is very little reference or respect for a marriage pact.  There's a recent transition in the US, of people waiting until they are a lot older to get married.  One reason is because feminist are eager for independence and the ability to make their own money.  Another reason is, everyone is really worried about divorce, and so they are now more hesitant to go into marriage.  More people now than ever are so scared of it, they won't even participate in a marriage ceremony.  Rather, they just move in together, so that if things go sour, they have an easy out and no track record to haunt them.<br>  <br>  Another issue involves the "McDonaldization" of America.  Americans want everything fast and easy.  Marriage is something that takes time and requires work.  Thus, the second things get hard or take genuine effort, we get lazy and give up.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it's sad.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	it depends on the situation. I was married to an abusive drunk for 13 years. do you think someone should stay in an abusive marriage?

I think that the biggest reasons are getting married to young, getting married to people who you don't know too long and lies, cheating on  the spouse!.... people don't look at marriage like they used to - one marriage for the life (of course they are exceptions like abusive marriage etc)... it's like in my opinion a lot of teen girls don't use protection think that abortion is ok... just sad...|`|tZkHHy5jaa	Divorce happens to mamy people with money.

Over 55% of all children born in the U.S. are now from single mothers, up over 200% from the 80s.<br>  <br>  The one most common factor in divorces and separations relates to age at the time they began their first relationship.  Those who marry or live with a partner prior to age 24 have an 85% chance of divorce and/or separation, including followup relationships.  Waiting to age 24 to begin having sexual relations significantly improves your chance of a long term commitment.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Hmmmm lets see divorce rates are 50% or higher.

I'd go see my friend and make amends.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	She probably assumes since a lot of time has passed, that things can be forgiven. Chances are she misses you and wants to talk things out. If you feel like things should be worked out I'd give her a call, tell her you don't want to pretend like nothing ever happened. Clear the air with her and then move on from there.|`|AA11460234	Call her and make a date for lunch.<br>  <br>  Mention nothing about the year passing unless you absolutely have to clear your soul and get that weight off of your chest.<br>  <br>  It ain't that hard. She made the first move. You'd be wise to follow though.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Obviously she missed you and regrets the estrangement between you.  She is reaching out to you to repair the friendship.  Why not do the same?  Real friends are hard to find.|`|AA10097443	get your pride out of the way..she was pregnant at the time..You know what it was like..let your guard down and start over again..and it will be has if it never happened.

You had a fight and she thought you hated her.  That is why she never called.  She was afraid of rejection.  She saw you and you spoke to her and now she thinks the door is back open.<br>  <br>  Life is too short for fighting and holding grudges.  If you truly love her, look past her faults and start talking again.  If you think she is overly dramatic or a bad person in some way, then don't start being friends again.  If she is a bad or negative influence don't let her back into your life.  Remember too that women change when they have babies.  I had mine at 27 and it changed me a lot.  I'm more positive and willing to forgive now.<br>  <br>  I realized that my best friend knows me better than anyone and that my life is better with her in it.  I let go of all the bad blood and resentment and we are friends again. Good luck.|`|AA11531535	You will never know if she is sincere or not unless you give it a try. Maybe she has changed since the baby was born. Maybe she realizes that fighting wasn't the answer. She probably only approached you because she saw you on neutral ground, she didn't know how to approach you in that year. Take a chance!|`|y4w6ybr3aa	It was probably bothering her too,that you haven't talked.<br>  you were both obviously being stubborn.<br>  She is trying to become friends again, I would call her and take her up on her offer to get something to eat.<br>  Unless, you had a good reason for not being friendly with her anymore?|`|NeTNnvSZaa	She feels bad that so much time has passed.  When people have children their priorities change and you seem to value life and the little things more.

For a woman, the average is now 35. For a man it is now 37.<br>  <br>  This is attributed to women working in career positions and waiting to have children until their careers are established. Men are likely getting married at an older age because women are just not marrying younger. For both it indicates increased maturity regarding marriage and family which should be a plus as opposed to the 20s ages when some immaturity was prevalent.|`|dbcf0ee8e2807308d8052adaae60d31baa	25 for men<br>  24 for women|`|81492b6d32bad860f8c004b9ecb2313daa	I'm not sure what the average age is but I think mid twentys is good.

5cea8b4af3aaa9197e37a9d61202bab3aa	If it's been a year and you're still feeling pain then you need to see a councelor because you're stuck in a circle of self pitty, past hurt etc. It means you haven't grown emotionally from that experience and you need to do something about it now. You've probably isolated yourself from others who could open your heart to beauty of the world which would help your wounds to heal and the scar of that experience to become an emotional graduation point. You also probably need to get off the Internet more and join some sort of human contact activities (sport, crafts, classess in community college etc.), which will help you take your mind of him and the hurt will start fading away bit by bit... and then you'll meet someone else who might be your life long partner, just make sure you don't become bitter because of this bad experience adn start stereotyping other guys, let it serve you as a starting point in becoming a better person because of it, through getting to know why you acted, reacted, what your needs were that needed to be met, uunderlying issues, what were contributing factors in your life for you beeing where you're at etc. If you don't know how to analyse your life and situations, draw positive conclusions and make new desicions which will progress your life, then you'd really need to see a councelor. Good counselor will know how to ask you the right questions so you will be able to make right conclusions and decisions for the future, they shouldn't tell you what to do... <br>  <br>  Experiences make us either richer, wiser, more compassionate and passionate about living life, or they can make us more selfish, bitter, depressed and disapointed - you do have a choice (through what you decide to think and how you decide to act/ respond to it).|`|2cab09a958be3acb1a9c218e65ee72ddaa	try to put your mind off the relationship. move on coz its been a year. make yourself busy, go on vacation, find a hobby, go to the gym. it only takes will power and a positive outlook in life|`|5fa20baf9cd0f93c2920041a61bc5519aa	you'll find a good man, just give yourself enough credit and love yoruself... the one who loves you will come then.<br>  <br>  NEVER settle for anything less than someone who inspires total trust and love from the depth of your heart.|`|AA12282153	You don't look stupid ,, you look humped and dumped !!!!!!!!?|`|831b78c27fde0d266aced71f4dcb422aaa	My heart too has been ripped apart by a man.

lIpjuMTHaa	I don't know, that's too hard to answer because when its a stranger you think that they must obviously be way better than you in some way to get your spouse to cheat on you. But with someone he knows then you know he is still thinking about that person sexually. Any kind of cheating is terrible and way to hard to forgive, it lowers your self esteem in so many ways and each has different ways it hurts you.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	I would not be able to forgive for any reason. No trust, no reason to be married.  But the sense of betrayal would be worse if it was a friend or one of my sisters.  It's a double whammy - you lose your spouse and a dear friend or sibling - that would be horrible!|`|uBssj3Znaa	I wouldn't forgive him regardless who it was. Cheating is never exceptable.|`|SiniSj1eaa	both would piss me the **** off.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Close friend or relative would be worst because it's not so easy to erase this person out of your life.<br>  Least offensive would be a complete stranger.

The possibility exists that they woudl not have done it if they knew you.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Its just hard to forgive period!  <br>  <br>  I don't think it would matter who it was.

However, I don't know what would be harder to forgive - either scenario could be difficult to deal with, depending on the circumstances. I have no idea what it would be like for my man to sleep with his children's mother, as I would never even consider dating (let alone marrying) a man with kids, because there's a lot more drama that comes with it besides him sleeping with the ex.
RzCirOKvaa	ok one thing first... girls may seem annoying especially when theyre around other girls... why dont you pick one of your friends and talk to her one on one. dont be affraid to go on a bunch of dates with everyone!! its not like 1 date gets you compromised, just experience. <br>  <br>  its great that you act natural around them, imagine finding a right girl while youre being a poser and then having to act like that all the time around her!!<br>  <br>  have fun doing all of this. dont focus on getting the girl. that just never works and of course we always know when youre doing it. focus on making her feel comfortable and pretty around you if you really like her. good luck!!|`|dixO8N8kaa	try making plans to go out with a group of friends to some popular under aged thing. like an underage nightclub, or we have a roller rink by me. bowling. and try meeting new people there.|`|8QCOSlNvaa	go to like church or something and be talkitive|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Don't worry about it. You don't need a girlfriend right now. In high school its always cool to have a GF and etc. But once your graduate and go to college and etc you start realizing its too much hard work. At this stage in your life you shouldn't care, you should be focused on having fun. Real relationships take too much work and time from you.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Look kid most of the time a guys bros (friends) teach him how to get girls. Sometimes it takes a little bit of work.

Just remember to b yourself!|`|ku8dGCGkaa	There are plenty of ways to act like you are interested without seeming creepy.

You need to project yourself as being more confident.  Don't be arrogant- just a bit more confident.  Also, I wouldn't try so hard if I were you.  Did you ever notice that when you try so hard sometimes, it doesn't work?  That's because it's not natural.  Just be yourself, have confidence in yourself and you'll be fine.  You had also asked how do you "act interested but not be creepy"?  That's the thing- don't "act".  People can see right through an act.  Be yourself and don't just look to get a girlfriend for the sake of getting a girlfriend- actually look for a girl you are attracted to both physically and emotionally.  Someone you have things in common with.  then you won't have to "act".  Go hang out at places that YOU enjoy going to.  If there are girls at that same place then that means you already have something in common with them.  Good luck and have confidence in yourself.|`|TZj4ZU6Daa	well don't go out with someone for the sake of going out with someone because you'll regret it especially if its someone from school, first you gotta find someone you like and i'm sure you do and then just try and get her you know how to its naturally built in, you don't need someone to tell you how, you just need to find someone your interested in - be patient and find the right one don't go with anyone and to find that person just get involved in a lot of social activities parties, through friends e.t.c and if you like anyone - move to them no secret formula to get them

Theres no reason they should be talking..Put your foot down and tell her that if she contiunes to talk to him you are leaving...If she wanted him in her life then why did they break up?|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Yeah I would let it go else you would find that you might be joining him. Look I am a magician and I work very intimately with my ex there are somethings to do with work that she is one of the only people I can talk to.  On stage we play hot and heavy for our act but off stage my girlfriend is the only one I care about. We sat down and had a chat about this and it settled things for keeps. Right now we are prepping another act because my girlfriend wanted us to. She trusts me and I will not violate that and we both know that. I guess this boils down to how much you care for yours|`|9t1taTCtaa	Yes you should end it, I still talk to my ex once in a while and I still like him, and i was in a relationship for 5 months with someone else...|`|Qxexz4mEaa	Since they are exes, maybe they really want to enjoy just having a relationship as friends and not completely shut each other out of their lives.|`|BcrYBSJmaa	It sounds innocent, try and avoid sounding jealous- but keep your eye on things.|`|zx0IQ1Fsaa	yes <br>  they might still be friends or acquaintances <br>  there is nothing wrong with that|`|iD8z7KZBaa	No and it's time for you to put your foot down.|`|aKkDWz5Waa	she still likes him!!!!!!<br>  <br>  she should find out if he feels the same<br>  <br>  if he does, then y r they apart again?|`|jAQVFrvOaa	In some cases this does happen ( i would say normal but it happens). Thats usually the part wen ppl break up and say lets jus b friends. I have an ex that im still cool with we talk and we also ask eachother for advice here and there. If it bothers you, then you should talk to your girlfriend about it, and tell her how you feel.|`|7ObD9tNbaa	well it depends, look at it logically not emotionally, if it's simple and short, then no worries, if its at least once a week, then tell her how you feel, also keep your head up, it might just be you worrying, or if you honestly think its something else, confront both of them. good luck to you:)|`|Lt03NhXPaa	well maybe they are one of the few people that when they broke up they decided they were going to stay friends and that is all they are i wouldnt really worry about it i mean me and one of my ex's are the same way and i call him for advice if i need it... so dont worry about it|`|b4WxO5fxaa	depending on why the relationship is severed and whoever fault it is why do you still want to talk to that person? move on with your life because feelings will get hurt and pride and jealousy will rear up perhaps in conversation|`|2k6WGszKaa	well, this can be tricky. it's normal, but it isn't always good. If it starts getting rteally bad, do some snooping! Not always the best thing,but you could ask some of her friends to see if anything is really going on|`|d8uJaLXYaa	Sounds kind of odd.<br>  Business? o.O<br>  I'd try and put a stop to it if I were you.<br>  Could be harmless but you should be cautious. Just in case.|`|IjkJVJNCaa	no its not normal at all.|`|G0mtkuDvaa	umm if thats happening then they are doing something behind your back|`|CLdM1OsLaa	Put a end to that real Fast!|`|5tjrSfmtaa	not normal but its possible.<br>  as long as yu trust there shud be no problem however.<br>  if ur gf wasnt telling yu this den maybe sumthing was fishy|`|JDiHhUeGaa	yeah...that's really not cool.

3RDOPzGeaa	Most of the time I think the person who does the dumping is the one with the most issues.. not the person who gets dumped. they are usually negative people who just can't be happy.. then you try to be friends with the person and realize this and are like 'no thanks'<br>  <br>  even when I did dumping I was usually the negative one with the issues.|`|5737f0111f183aa3e07767b0362ccc9caa	Yes!  I'm thrilled to death I didn't marry the fiance who brought his secretary home for the weekend and then tried to pick a fight with me, for goodness sake!  What a boring life.<br>  Nice of you to be kind to him for awhile, but now you are not required to allow this loser to waste any more of your time.|`|5687JygEaa	In a way yes and no. See I'm still in love with my ex, but while in the relationship I felt like i lost most of myself. When he dumped me it was the worst thing, but I realized that I was missing so much in my life.

She has no goals and no self respect.|`|ee5MawLdaa	Oh yea!!!! I was in one where i thut hes the one and i can never love another. . . . wheeeeeeew screw that! I now realize how blind i was by love. He isnt even worth my thoughts. lol|`|BVyZfC04aa	Ha yes. But this guy was so miserable I actually had to push him into dumping me. If I'd had done it, it would've been yet another thing for him to complain about.|`|IocgFjr2aa	I wish I could realize that. But now I'm just pissed off that he dumped me.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Yes when I was a teenager I was crazy about this girl. We never had sex.

Only once they are settled in a new relationship or heavily medicated do they realize that it was for the best and they should be ever so lucky.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	Once, I was butt-crazy in love with an older guy. He was about 10 years older than me (I was 23 and he was 33 by the time we split) and we got along really well for the most part. He ended up breaking up with me, realizing that a relationship between us was all fun and dandy at the time, but down the line it was going to end up strained. <br>  <br>  I had always made it very clear I wanted to get married and have children, whereas he didn't necessarily have the same goals, and felt he was already reaching an age where those goals were unattainable and not necessarily desired.<br>  <br>  It hurt like hell when he ended it, but I now see it was for the better. We split at a time where it is now possible for us to be good friends, and the strain of a once faltered relationship isn't a problem.|`|AA11447210	Not dumped, but my first husband ended our marriage (many years ago) and that was truly a blessing in disguise. I was not emotionally strong enough to do it myself at the time, and had stayed in it years longer than I should have. When he finally wanted to end it to be with someone else, it gave me a new chance at a different life.<br>  <br>  I hate that I wasted 7 yrs with him, but he also did me the biggest favor ever!|`|q2POh1dEaa	Honestly, I think all break-ups are like that.  Your heartbroken and blinded at first by the break-up, but after time, you realize, he/she wasn't good for you anyway, and you deserve better.  You broke up for a REASON, obviously it wasn't going to work out. Most of the time breakups teach us all something.<br>  <br>  Move on, live and learn, and let go.|`|awskuSGBaa	Absolutely. Dodged that bullet without even knowing.

As to my situation...  Coz I never trusted the woman I love every time she's out of my sight, & even when she's on my sight, coz she never stopped texting even if we are together...<br>  <br>  Just think as if he never existed every time he is out of your sight, live life as if it is your last, be happy to any opportunities you'll have (without him), & never trust him but set him free...<br>  <br>  I hope you understood what i mean...<br>  <br>  I'm a man!!!|`|AA12211869	start flirting around.|`|cb43a9d41104a418ef186c4ce916bcfdaa	Tell him that it hurts your feelings when he does thing like that and ask him to stop it. If you mean something to him he won't do it again - at least not when you're around.
TsFG4zLmaa	Do you know how many people work full time jobs, and no one is there to be with their dogs?  The dog is 5 years old, not a puppy who would need constant care and training.  You are respecting your husband by not only working full and part time, but you take care of your house also.  I think your husband needs to respect your wants, and if you found a dog you fell in love with, he should let you get it. Especially if he said you could mabe get one if you saw one at the pound.  If you already have other dogs, why dosen't he worry that you are not home 24/7 with them?  Really only puppies need that constant care.  I saw the picture, and he is soooo cute, I don't blame you for falling in love with him.  I have a 5 pound Yorkie, and he is the best.  Good Luck, and tell your husband you deserve this, you have always wanted this, and you actually have the opportunity to get this, and you are also helping give this cute dog a home.  Mabe take him with you to meet the dog.  My husband never wanted a small dog until he went with me to look at our Yorkie, and now my dog is his dog.  Good luck!!!!|`|tao83sDxaa	yes, put your foot down on more than the dog. hubby can pitch in doing things around the house more, but you trained him when you first got married, he needs to be told he got to pitch in and help, you are not his mother you are his wife, a partner. there needs to be a division of  labor. hand him a scoop and a plastic bag, point him to  the yard and say go do it. when he gets in give him a huge kiss, for everything he does to help you give him a big wet one, kinda like the dog will do. you need to retrain hubby.|`|cdQryr7paa	If he has a dog, then all the agument about not being there enough to take care of the dog you want is void.<br>  If he can have a dog, then you can have a dog.<br>  Go get it.<br>  What is he going to do about it once you have it.<br>  These are the words I live by:<br>  "It's better to ask forgivness than permission"<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, and go get that dog before they put it down.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Put your foot down! The way my mother always done when my stepdad said no about getting a dog then my mother gets it anyways because he said no about getting another dog and my mother shows him that she is getting another dog!|`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	I say go get the dog, he is adorable...save a life! I work 40 a week and also have a part time job, my pit bull Max does fine at home. I go home for lunch everyday, and take him out. Go get the dog.|`|AA11447210	You both work 40 hrs/wk, plus you do the house work and shopping, plus you have another dog already, plus you have a part time job on top of that...not to mention your relationship with your husband? When were you planning on having time to spend with another dog?<br>  <br>  Not trying to shoot you down, but it sounds like you just decided you wanted a cute little dog, but didn't give any consideration to what would happen after that. Why have a dog just to say "I have a dog" if you don't have time to spend with it? It needs a lot of time, every day...not just a pat on the head and some food in the bowl.<br>  <br>  It may simply be that this isn't the ideal time since you don't appear to have enough hours in the day free, to spend with a dog (especially a puppy that would need to be trained).<br>  <br>  Be realistic...I love dogs myself, but when my life is busy and I'm hardly ever home (and when I am home I'm busy) I wouldn't want a pet. It wouldn't be fair to that animal. <br>  <br>  However, you could use the excuse that the new dog would be a companion to the one you already have, since neither of you seem to have time to spend with that dog either.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	If he is not in agreement, it is a bad idea no matter what his reasoning is. He can come up with the most ridiculous excuse in the world, but the bottom line is that he will be unhappy with a pet in the house. You must honor that even if it doesn't seem fair and doesn't make sense. He lives there too and has a right to say what goes on inside his home.|`|7eaf5c689c77b9c042b4be96ab16b8abaa	Wow - get the dog without your husband's consent.  Would you adopt a child without your husband's consent?  I agree, you need to call him on his promises, but don't proceed like the other fools say to.  Someone else mentioned you may already have a dog?  If that is the case his argument is moot - more ammo for you.|`|Smv1pNk7aa	I don't know exactly why your husband does not want the dog but if it is b/c he knows they need care and attention then maybe you should consider a hamster or bird first. Show him you will be responsible for something small first and then move up to a dog. Good luck.|`|K4bJgTF4aa	go get the dog with out your hubbie's consent...he will be happy and in love with the dog.  plus you are your own person.  let him deal with that.|`|AA12262106	There's something about the dynamic between you and your husband that doesn't seem quite right. <br>    The issue of adopting a pet has been discussed and it seems like now that there's an opportunity to adopt, he's going back on his word.<br>    The other thing that I find a little strange is that your husband is vetoing the decision.If my partner really, really wanted a pet I would have a hard time saying no because I'd want her to be happy.<br>     The dog you've chosen is certainly cute. I think you should fight for what you want.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	First of all, I think it's a little rude that the people at the shelter called you a door mat.<br>  <br>  But anyway, I don't see why you can't have the dog. It's adorable, and it sounds like you already have other dogs that would keep it company. Also, its not a puppy, it doesn't need as much care or stimulation as a puppy would. And this dog is in the pound, it will be happy with a warm home and people who love it.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your husband just doesn't want another dog and is just making excuses. Tell him that he promised you a small dog if you found one and that your heart is set on this one, and that this is better than a younger dog because it is already potty trained, etc. But it is not fair that your husband has the final say on the matter.|`|BoPe4Svfaa	wait in additional details you say you pick up your other dogs poo? so that means you already have a dog, and if his excuse is your never there for it or you can't be there what does the dog you have now do? you're not there for that one.<br>  <br>  i see it as an excuse, specially if the dog you have now is HIS, thats selfish and you should be able to have your own also. i'd put my foot down on this one. SPECIALLY if your current dog is his. <br>  <br>  then again he could be saying not to get it cause he doesn't want two dogs, but that was his choice to get the first one, and you've been asking for your little dog, so i think you should get your wish now|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Dog's are additional responsibilities, just like kids and your husband knows he will in some way be called upon to deal with this dog.  Before you ask HIM to sacrifice his time, money & energy on another addition to the family you might look at your husbands plate.  If he is already stressed, tired, complaining about not having enough time for himself, complaining about finances etc. than perhaps you should back off from wanting another dog because there will come a time when YOUR not around and he is stuck with dealing with the dog.<br>  <br>  On a second issue, I'm not really a big fan of leaving dogs a lone in the house for any length of period.  My wife works from the house (occassionally leaving for 2 - 4 hours depending on the day) while I'm at work.  If she held her old 40 hour work week (away from the house) while I was also at my work (away from the house) we would never have opted to bring a dog in the house.  If she had to go back to a standard work schedule, well the dogs would have to adjust (what can you do) but I wouldn't bring another pooch into the scenario.<br>  <br>  Ultimately your husband can't STOP you from getting a dog.  You live there and your an adult capable of making your own decision.  Maybe your husband originally said you could have another dog but ya know what, this is a free world and people change their minds based upon circumstances of their lives.  You are his wife, maybe you should ask yourself why he has changed his mind and look at the situation.|`|IHZJNZ9waa	well, it's not a baby. it's already 5. so it's not like it needs the same attention a puppy does.<br>  <br>  your husband isn't being fair. let this answer your question: is it more unfair to not have attention 24/7, or to be in a cage in a pound where he or she will eventually put to sleep without any love? do the right thing =]|`|8aqveZrWaa	I think you should get it, especially since he has told you over and over again, he didn't expect for you to find one, and it would not be dis respecting him if you did get it, it would be doing what he said you could and that isn't even right........Marriage is a two thing deal, you have to give in order to receive, and that goes for both, he should not get to tell you what you can do, and furthermore, dog's don't need someone there 24/7, just as long as you love him (the dog) and take care of him and it sounds like you will that is all that counts. And yes it does sound like you are his maid, but women always do more than men anyways and since you are taking care of "his" dog he should be okay with you getting 'your" dog!! So, i say go for it girl, what's he gonna do "divorce you" not hardly, because their probably isn't another one out there that would do what you are doing for him!!!
uAaz5Mb7aa	Well,as a hispanic woman, I would say money...Hispanic men are very generous. They like for their women to have the best of the best. But of course with every good thing there's a catch. Hispanic men are very jealous. They want to know everything from your where abouts to who your with,where you at and what time you'll return. More like demand it. I find hispanic men to be obsessive too. Thats why I date African American men. They give you your space and let you have your time, they're also very giving and romantic.Thats just my opinion.
a23c5f4d1193fc5b119200baa494ab77aa	well. one year difference isn`t a lot but since you`re young. it might be a little different. cause since everyone around you in school is young too people might think it`s weird. but sooner or later you`ll be going out with a lot of younger people. and you`re friends will too. but remember. you guys are still young so if i were you i would just think about something else rather than relationships cause you still got plenty of time. i mean enjoy it before you get old. but if you really want to be with him then go for it. good luck ! =]|`|AA11412746	One year difference and that matters?

She sounds like an energetic spirit whom has no problem with self creative expression.<br>  <br>  She needs someone who will fill her with light not take it from her as you will unconsciously (without intent mean't) take it from her and zap her of her spritely nature.  I do not mean to drop a hat on you, please do not take it personally.  This world needs people like her and people like you too.  It is just that you have attracted her for a reason, find the reason and move on if you find her 'light' too bright.<br>  <br>  Please humble and allow her to be herself and be in allowance of her good nature.  If she is expressing herself in the negative light then you may need to unsecure your relationship with her or help her if it is a situation that involves you directly or otherwise.<br>  <br>  Have you ever allowed herself to know the 'real' you or is this a superficial relationship?  I think you would know the difference.  If you talk about her negatively behind her back, then you are doing both of yourselves an injustice and this relationship is one on the path of many yet to come.<br>  <br>  Blessings be yours in peace and light<br>  Harriett Potty ;)

Don't read into the fact that all his friends say he likes you a lot.  I had this happen to me a few years back- he lived about 3 hours away from me, badgered me to come visit, and right after I did he blew me off.  He did seem to enjoy my presence while I was out there with him, just as your man appears to be, and I heard from his friends that he liked me.

AA10378559	Asians are hardly more worthy than any woman, beautiful or otherwise. While many Asian women are exceedingly beautiful, I'm not sure that's the only attraction they have for military men, or even businessmen. What they are is exotic, culturally and physically exotic, from women in our own culture. This sometimes causes an extreme attraction even for Asian women who are not beautiful. They are still brought up to give deference to men, cater to them, even, much as their mothers and grandmothers had been raised. This is like an aphrodisiac to American men who are used to women brought up on Women's LIb.<br>  <br>  This is not to say that you can't compete with these women. You and all your sisters, black and white, who are attractive females don't have to take a back seat to Asian women if you but look for men that are not so enamored of them. There must be some of them, too. So set your cap for one of them, instead of the gaggle that forms in line for Asian girls. I take it that you are in the service in Japan, or have recently been. Good luck in snatching a good man away from these would-be geishas.|`|AA12203862	no my wife is a soul sister as you people say..but although i hate her..she was and somewhat still is fairly more attractive then a backstabbing gooko.|`|AA11069745	This is a strange question.<br>  <br>  No.  <br>  <br>  Military men living overseas for long periods of time of marrying age will of course marry and date the local women, because they are available and new.  <br>  <br>  You kind of have to just start being confident in your own looks and ability to attract a man and move on with your life.  You are creating useless mental drama and focusing on the men dating these women instead of focusing on who's looking at you.  <br>  <br>  Stop looking at the Asian chicks (unless you want to date them too) and start paying attention to the men who want you.|`|AA11333317	No, I do not believe so.  There are many beautiful women from all nationalities.  I believe that men like the "delicateness" of oriental woman.  Also remember, a beautiful face does not mean a beautiful heart.

vtW3qPZmaa	I'm pretty sure the questioner wasn't being rude... unfortunately all that people outside of the deep south know about the deep south are the redneck stereotypes.<br>  <br>  As a fellow Brit (living in North America) I can also attest to the fact that no Brit I've ever met gets upset about having the Royal Family slammed.  Being educated in the UK our history classes have actual history in them that spans back further than 2 centuries, so any half-intelligent Brit can tell you about the genealogy of European Royal families very well.  We're all aware of the upper class inbreeding norms of days gone by, thanks for trying to educate us in our own history, though.<br>  <br>  If you truly want to dispel the redneck stereotypes try telling the poster something real and interesting about the deep south instead of getting all bitchy about it.  You'd be surprised at how willing people are to learn, and seeing that the only representation of deep south states that Europeans get tend to be on US TV shows there's a lot to learn!|`|QenW1Ok7aa	People all over the US marry their cousins-just as people do in the rest of the world. It is illegal in some states, but not most, and science has proved of late that there is no huge reason for cousins not to procreate.<br>  <br>   In some Appelachian regions of the 'deep south', it has been reported by local authorities that there are more cases of incest/sibling molestation than in other parts of the US. But you must remember that the Appelachian region is EXTREMELY 'poor'-they live on par with people in third world countries as opposed to people in the US or UK.<br>  <br>   Even there, however, no one 'marries' their sister. Some[not many, it's an extremely TINY minority] RAPE their sisters. It's an extremely religious region as well as being poor, so you have girls who are not knowledgeable about sex, and afraid to tell their parents what happened.[Keep in mind that these girls do NOT have television in their homes, they only listen to local gospel and bluegrass radio stations, etc.Many households there still have outhouses rather than indoor toilets.] In other words, picture a society around the year 1930 or so. How many girls then would tell their families if their brother or father or uncle raped them? Hardly any, they didn't even have the language to describe it. And 'the man' was considered 'the head' of the family-so it's her word against His.<br>  <br>  As to all the UK folks who got mad at the Brit jokes-aah, grow up :)<br>  <br>   What do you expect when someone asks such an insensitive question? Ya'll are supposed to be POLITE ;)|`|xieiM0FRaa	Uhm...I haven't personally known anyone to, but if it does happen, it's probably not just restricted to the South.

What are his good points? I believe the best way to break the emotional tie is to focus on what your priorities are, and to put him on a back burner.  When and/or if he is tired of offering you that lame excuse and is ready, he will let you know one way or the other.|`|54f8db83b666edef084c5490fe6e76deaa	I have had that exact same thing happen to me, I told one of my friends I had feelings for them, and I found out he was using that same excuse, and so I showed him what he was missing by dating another guy, well he got jealous, so i told him he didn't want me and he told me he didn't want a boyfriend girlfriend relationship to ruin our friendship so we made a deal, that when we broke up we would still be friends. We dated and it was wonderful.<br>                               Good Luck!|`|79e405bc5f5882ec8a82913c6046b119aa	You need to break the emotional apron strings, and get out and  meet other guys, and friends.

The only reason I know it to begin with is that I was part of a gifted experiment to teach it to 1st and 3rd graders. Either way:<br>  <br>  Nature is a cruel joke played on poor en to begin with, who -- from the time they are sperm in other men -- are just one in millions with the same goal. It isn't that they don't want to love just one woman, it's that statistically, if they don't love a million indiscriminately, they are biologically disposable. When a man finds a woman to whom he is indispensable, the universe to him takes on a new meaning that isn't so harsh and murderous and dis-compassionate.

Find out which one you really like the best and the only way is to date them all.   The one you feel makes you special and you start thinking more about than the others, then spend more time with that one.   The idea behind dating is to pick the right one.   If we already knew the answer we would just marry on the first date and start having children.|`|dd5c636338ed83b09026fd3d2bbcdb91aa	If you are not dating either one of them right now, then you are not committed to either one.  <br>  <br>  Go out with the one you like the most.  <br>  <br>  If only one is asking, then go out with the one that is asking.

Just don't sleep with either of them or do anything crazy like that and you should be fine.

I don't know if you like both of them but, you sound like you are a very nice person that thinks of others. There is nothing wrong with that. So, I say date both of them and let both of them know what you are looking for in a relationship. The right on will stay. Not to worry about the one that strays. If this doesn't sound right do what your heart tells you to do. There isn't much logic when it comes to love....it's from the heart. Good luck and have fun.|`|7ed3e80d92e05e0f5ed457d92584196daa	It's your life and you shouldn't be overly-concerned with the other persons feeling.

If you worried about everyone else's feelings, you will never be happy yourself. You can "go out" with whoever you want. You aren't committed to either. If either of them can't handle that, it will show their maturity level and should make your decision easier.|`|042a6fb9d6a9bacea652fd0d88834824aa	Its hard deciding between two boys.  If you already no which one you like it is alot easier. Dont feel guily about telling the one you like that you like them the truth just because your worried about hurting the other ones feelings, they will just have to deal with it. <br>  <br>  And just because you are worried about hurting one of their feelings doesnt mean that you like them too. That is just human. Anyone with a heart doesnt want to hurt someones feelings. <br>  <br>  I think you should really think about it. Like think about saying that you want to go out with, say one guys name is Jeff, think about saying "i love you jeff" if all your heart is into it and not one part of you doubts that it is true then you must love him. Then do it for the other guy, same thing. That should help you pick if you dont already no. If you do no just tell the guy you like that you like him too.  I mean no worry you already no he likes you. Dont worry about the other guys feelings i mean you can still be his friend. He will just have to face that facts, your not that into him.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, i hope my advice helps!!|`|AA11715392	get rid of them both, problem solved|`|be886d8ece46ac4cad26442d35fbfab8aa	i think you should be on the level.  tell the one that need space and want to date other people.  its better than continuing in a relationship that is lukewarm. it might be unpleasant in the short term, but its better in the long run.
AA10378559	You're very young. Making a decision to marry, even to someone you've know a long time at your ages is something, it seems to me, that you have to be sure about. I know of cases where it worked out great, and the couple were married to celebrate their Silver (25-year) Anniversary. But I know of couples who discovered that, under the close microscope of marriage, they really weren't suited to one another. They feel trapped and resentful. It will likely end in divorce.<br>  <br>  So, I ask you, will you be a bride who will stay married; or will you start to find things wrong and decide that the marriage is not for you? You've got to think hard about this.<br>  <br>  As far is it being a friend who you didn't know had such feelings for you, well, I can only relate a story of the time when I wanted to be married so badly that I asked a girl I'd been dating casually to marry me. I knew I didn't love her, and she knew I didn't. Luckily for me, or us both, she said no. But a friend can make a good spouse. I'm married now to a woman who is a friend in reality, as much as she is my wife.|`|d18e88aa7a76031ffdaca14e56e08e98aa	You've just graduated from high school. You are very, very lucky to have a good friend that has become a partner, at least for now. There's a very good chance that it will lead to marriage.<br>  <br>  However.<br>  <br>  You've just graduated from high school. Whether you go on to college or not, you're suddenly going to start having new experiences, and meeting new people outside of that group of "same people" you've been hanging out with. Your lives, and so both of you, are going to undergo significant change.<br>  <br>  Here's my advice: keep dating, but don't consider marriage plans yet. Give yourselves a year or two out of high school first. He waited from seventh grade until now to switch from friendship to romance? Well, he'll wait a few more years for marriage.|`|AA11109844	I say best wishes and don't think twice about it! Statistics show that those who have taken the time to know each other and become friends first have a longer lasting and more fullfilling and loving marriage. I know it might seem weired to you because it's not really the "norm" but I think it's a VERY GOOD THING!! Consider yourself lucky and don't stop loving your best friend!! :-) Good Luck

Okay, I may not be stuck in the exactly same situation with you, but I go to an art college & I take Fine Arts. Somentimes I do feel the pressure to be 'different', but of course the positive kind of difference (I don't plan to be a very weird artist-wannabe), and because of this, I often find myself struggling n trying too hard to create something which isn't very common. Results? Nothing. Nothing will come out when you are trying too hard. Just stay back, babe, and enjoy yourself.

c91032f4386f0b1ceea8747a91b30331aa	Does he really love you? Possibly, but more than likely not.. He more than likely "loves" the fact that you are available to serve his "needs" without him having to give up the piece of "pie" he already has at home. <br>  <br>  Did you do the right thing? It depends... Are you going to stick with what you told him or did you just use that as a tool (as most of us have once or twice in life) to see how he would respond. Search your soul and you will find the answer to all of your questions.. <br>  <br>  Number 1: If someone loves you, NOTHING would stop them from being with you if they really wanted to.. <br>  <br>  Number 2: Even a kid carries the ability to lie ("Yes Mama, I've finished my homework") in order to get to go outside and play!

If him and his wife can't get along, then he should just get a divorce so they can both be free to find someone that will make them happy. The fact that he doesn't seem to be willing to do this makes it sound like he's just wanting to have his cake and eat it too. He may like you, but I doubt he loves you the way you want him to.<br>  <br>  I was in a similiar situation with a married person who claimed they were in a lousy relationship and they'd rather be with me, but 6 years later, they're still with their spouse, despite how bad their relationship is, and I was left alone. Suffice it to say, I learnt my lesson the hard way.<br>  <br>  I think you did the right thing in telling him not to call you anymore. It may be tough now, but you probably spared yourself even more heartache down the road.
758d8dbb3394cc4ff7b0b834eadae21eaa	first think of one think you really like about her if it is the style of her hair or color or what every just tell her that give her a compliment and say something nice rehearse it first in the mirror or to a trusted friend and relax you can do it think to yourself that she likes you and talk to her as a friend and ask her questions then just ask her out and even if she has a b/f she may want to date you go out as friends and just see!!! what happens  look her in the eyes tho not at the floor or any think else be confident you will be fine!!!|`|f64a428ecf8619a21d081ed48c8aae13aa	Take small steps towards opening up to females. Eventually once you know someone you will become comfortable with then.|`|0f0088ebe0a3216fea55f2a8225f4134aa	If you are shy the best thing to do when you are acting that way is to ask if anyone is going to do it for you.  The answer will be "no". So if you want something you will have to be the one to do it, even if it is something meaningless. You should remind yourself about this everytime, and that might be enough to get you to just get out there and do it.|`|40aeba0b67c417134a1e15c76cd0faefaa	i still havn't gotten past shyness unless i've already known them, then i'll pretend i don't like them like i always have|`|79df02f6727268ac3d9c091da9bffbb1aa	Im shy, well not as much as i used to be, i used to look down when talking to a girl thats how bad it was. but over the years i have become a lil more confident, and i talk soooo much but i cant look them in the eye probably due to being self concious! i thinkif u like a girl, try not being attracted to her in that way, just consider her as a normal girl n be free with her like as if she was a really good friend once u can get past that u should be ok n then grow stronger feelings! just keep talking to girls whether its on the phone on the net etc u should get used to it!|`|8b50c69e20d4c973ee9951b1b7a4e810aa	Okay, I just moved and I am a really shy kinda guy also. I seriously will not talk until I am talked too,but in my old home, I would not stop talking to my friends and anything. When I had my first girlfriend I was the most shy guy, which is part of the reason we broke up. I have learned to take more chances. The best advice I could give you, is do not be afraid to get hurt.|`|AA12082496	Well, being shy is not your fault but not trying to be out there with everyone else is your fault. i think that you should be out there with your friends or get to know more people. what do you think... and there is a another type of shy...that is being shy with girlssss. is that you?,,, then that i can't help....you just have to learn how to be smooth with the girl...your on your own dude....

ee56907751fb04cfd1cd8e8596792cbdaa	Personally?  You've only known this man for seven months.  Maybe you should slow things down before running off with him.  After all, you're mother's blood and it seems like you love her very much.  It would be a shame to move to Texas with your boy and destroy your relationship with your mother, only to not have things work out.|`|AA10665652	If you really love him enough to marry him and to do what he wants you to, and if you want to move back to Colorado anyway, then do it! I've never lived out of California, but I've lived in 3 locations, twice, now.|`|AA11249370	Follow your heart.  Love has no time limit.  Mom may be upset now, but if she knows you are happy she will come around. I live in Texas and have visited Colorado. I would be happy in either place.  If your relationship doesn't work Mom will be there for you. Don't have harsh words with her cause they can never be taken back once said.
AA11547521	Let your friends daughter know that it wasn't anything she did, the guy has issues he will be forced to deal with.  Most victims feel that it was something they did, you need to concentrate on letting her know she didn't do anything wrong, that should be your primary goal.<br>  <br>  Has for the father, sit him down with your best friend and one other person who you completely trust and tell him.  Do it while they jerk is in jail.  This will give the father sometime to let it soak in and give him time to cool down.|`|ecd8878664bcce3ec7187e61bf72ead8aa	The father deserves to know right now.  The longer you wait, then he'll be mad at all of you.  Most likely, yes, he will become very enraged.   Then he will feel guilty that he couldn't protect his daughter.  Let him have this feelings, but remind him that he needs to be strong for his daughter, and not have her worrying about him, too.<br>  I really recommend getting the daughter into therapy, too.  Family counseling is not a bad idea, either.  This is as traumatic as a death in the family.|`|24d0f6d78429fd0e800beaff5da8f497aa	Just let her know how sorry you are, and that he guy deserves to be in jail, and she should not feel sorry for him.  She would do other girls a favor if this person was behind bars.  She would also feel better knowing that her dad is  there to protect her.|`|2d6ea5a08a3166a2c9231f98a3e39334aa	In regards to the girl (poor thing), I guess the best thing you can do is let her know you're there for her if she wants to talk.  She'll probably have to talk about this to the authorities, so she may not want to keep talking about it much.<br>  <br>  As for her dad, a small family meeting may be a good route.  Maybe even slip him a Xanax before you tell him (not trying to be funny here).  It will just keep him calmer while this is explained to him.  Make sure to emphasize that he will do his daughter no good in jail.  Damn, that would be hard.  The first thing I would want to do is castrate that man!  I can only imagine how you all feel.|`|AA11462969	comfort her its the worst thing to happen to her children besides losing her. just tell her she is here and not dead!!|`|c4b75b4e9335d71b5762fe1330f81ef1aa	someone needs to tell her dad. and they need to tell him that he cant go crazy. No matter how much he wants to. I was sexually abused for years. When I finally told, and my dad went to jail, everything got SO crazy and chaotic. I didnt feel like the abuse was nessicarly my fault, but all the crap that happened after THAT was my fault. I felt horrible that Id caused such a problem. everytime my mom cried I felt It was my fault. You all have to keep calm. Make sure that everything that needs to happen happens like, this guy goes to jail, and making sure the girl knows everything is going to be fine. Make sure she knows and feels like she did the right thing by telling. Just saying..."you did the right thing" thats just a line everyone says. If you say, "you did the right thing" then keep it a secret from her dad or she sees all the problems everyones having now that she told, shes not going to believe you. and shell feel awful|`|21608e8db8c8d7e3829d32be8453e641aa	It is best advice to tell him in front of a counselor or someone like that so they can help him control his anger.  He is going to be more angry if they don't tell him soon after all it is his daughter and friend.  He needs to know.  If you feel that strong that he is going to do something stupid it is best to do it with a professional around to help him deal with everything.|`|26daecbe85446e475784e78d815b73afaa	As a person who has been in the position of the daughter...Im going to try and help. Theres not much you can say to make things right. The important things is that you be there when she does need you. Everyone deals with things in their own way. Myself...I was molested by my stepfather, who my mother has stayed married too. I still see this person several times a week becasue my mother is very important to me but I also feel a resentment toward her for picking this man over me. But Ive pushed things aside and I deal with it.  This will affect her for the rest of her life in one way or another. As Ive said...be there for her when she needs you and you will know when that is. <br>  Now about her dad....Maybe her mom needs to sit down and talk to him while this guy is in jail that way by the time he gets out maybe dad will have calmed down some and wont be so ready to kill him. But the mom needs to explain that the reason for him not being told right away is for the fact that they were concerned that he would do something to land him in jail and then he would be no help to the daughter when she would need him.<br>  Hope Ive helped. Any other questions feel free to ask.<br>  ME|`|2ebe5fd84a0993d4946d5967add047d9aa	well $$$$$$$$$0000000000RRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYY|`|3e90b89770ef8e563fc00df6e4c85931aa	it's going to be hard but tell him about the consequences if he hurts the guy or even kills him.  the cops will understand why he did it but they must arrest him anyway because no one can take the law into their own hands.  it sucks cause i know i'd want to do the same thing, but the law's the law.  tell him his daughter needs him outside of jail, not locked up next to this sorry waste of a life as if he were the criminal.  the way things are nowadays, he---meaning that piece of work---would get out on bail while he---her father---stays in jail for assault or some other charge we all know is full of crap.|`|44ca2c04657a1213c69c0e82b1132203aa	personally speaking... the calamity has hit (or is going to hit) them... so what ever some one says or does....is going to affect them only in a small way.... But in order to make them open their eyes to a new prespective of looking at the whole thing is what u can do... For the daugther, u can give her 2 options... <br>  1) keep thinking about it for the rest of her life and ruin all the happiness that life might have had in store for her and her near and dear ones... hardships, failures, sorrow.... <br>  2) Forget it, the moment the guilty is punished... realise that i was an incident that happened one day like a road accident...take up a job she likes doing... keep herself busy and assure the family that she has come over it and is looking forward...That's what energises the family... the fact that their girl has moved ahead....Infact after overcoming times of distress one realises how positive it can be and suddenly their talent shows its head..<br>  As for the father, its the same<br>  he has to know what's happened... and he better think about all before doing anything... an elder person who is close to the family and the father has respect for, should be asked to make the daugther speak to father... sometimes elders listen to their peers more than anyone else....<br>  1) he can get angry, want to serve justice with his hands... think what others would feel and what his daugther would do... make life difficult for everyone around..<br>  2) he can just have some quiet moments with the daugther and family and just see away the storm... take them to a vacation and try to sort the matter out by looking at how day by day people forget things and move ahead... realise the truth that just because some sick guy splased dirty water on u does not mean u remain dirty for the rest of ur life....only the dress gets dirty... change it...he has to realise his daugther is still the most respectable, kind and precious thing in the world.. and make her feel that way...<br>  U make sure u stay as close to the family as possible and try to bring out bare and practical truths of the decisions they make....some times truth goes a long way in helping things slower but forever... <br>  I hope i could help...|`|5f0b07a0a9921a1047fae0ed46ef71f2aa	hi...my cousin has experienced the same thing...she was also molested as a child.  She was very afraid that her dad my might do something horrible to the man who did that to her.  So she kept quiet and told me about it years later. Well she later find out he did the same thing to our other cousin.  She did not stay quiet this time...we pressed charges and told the family.  If this person is not stopped he will do it again to another member.  And that is absolutely WRONG.  He needs to be behind bars with the other perverts.  The family needs to know so they can protect the other children and keep it happening to one of theirs.|`|6112c233b6f868bf0ca15bbf9400f89faa	It's tough but let her dad when no one is around and give him time to take it all in/ as for her, be with her and let her  know she can trust you because she needs everyone right now|`|AA10883492	i know where u r comin frm i hated it it people talked about it i would ask first how she feels to talk  about it if she dont leave her alone it can really mess someone up in the head let her be for a min dont nag it cause believe me she will get pissed i knoe i did|`|a1107c6887d39c2b53384acfbd266d76aa	you know what! encourage her to inform her parents together what this dirty dog has done. when i was ten years old my uncle, who lived up stairs from my parents molested me. i would go up to keep my aunt company sometimes and even fall asleep on my aunts couch. one nite i woke up with his hands everywhere. it scared the hell out of me! i ran down stairs and woke my mom up who begged me not to tell my dad or wake my father up. she hurried me down in the basement, into the storage room, where my dad would not hear us. she begged me not to tell my father, that her sister's husband molested me. i begged her telling her "we should tell daddy but she said please, he may kill him" so i didn't tell. it was a wrong move. he molested at least ten other girls in my family after molesting me. everyone kept it a secret. his *** should have been beat, DOWN! he was never confronted until i got old enough myself(16), to tell him, if it should(molestation) happen to anyone, to my sisters or anyone that my aunts' babysits you will go to down, to jail or somewhere. i think DAD should be made aware that this man is a violator. this guy is locked up and let him stay locked up. let that father know,  what that fool that he thinks he knows well, has done! the dad will be hurt if he finds out from someone else. you or the mom or the daughter should tell dad. this predator may attack someone else if he let loose in the family again or the community. take it from an expert. tell on that clown!|`|cd34cfb1855c0db9c41884cf1ebe512baa	See to getting Father Anger Manigement Councling,<br>  Whole family is best but if he Refuses to go then go to find out what can be done.<br>  Molester NEEDS help before it go's TOO far and it can !<br>  Think about what Witholding ANY information could cause another Girl MABE even Younger.

I tried to keep my composure.  He thought I was confident and not nervous, yeah right!  I was a wreck inside.  We had a great first date that I didn't want to end.  We shared a hug and said we would like to meet again.  Our second date was a few days later.  We talked until the wee hours.  I kissed him goodnight.

Sorry. <br>  But he is trying to keep you as his best friend. This ---> "puts his arm around me, talks, laughs, and always is concerned if I don't look happy" is because you two are friends. That is just how friends act around each other. <br>  <br>  If you reallyy think he likes you, talk to him about it. <br>  Meanwhile, stay out of his girlfriend's way, to avoid conflict.

scyLaz0saa	tell your guy you want to spice things up a bit and you want to know if he would be up for it.  Then both of you write down 3 fantasies.  (3 things he would like and 3 things he would like to do to you.  And vice versa for you to him and you would like to receive).  Then go over the list together.  Add things or subtract things together.  <br>  <br>  Also try the game "May I".  If your in the dominating mood or he is.  Ask permission to do anything.  The person receiving has to say yes to it.  It adds a bit to the bedroom.  Hope this helps.  Good luck to you.|`|AA11624887	Start by talking to him... bringing up the subject of fantasies.

I've never met a man that said "Eeww gross" to anything in the bedroom!|`|PY160XO7aa	How old are you again????|`|s8yCwPedaa	Like with most any guys...........just ask, you'll be surprised|`|tZkHHy5jaa	If you're going to marry him, he must pleases you in some way. If you tell him about your fantasies and it freaks him out, then you might not get off as often. Be honest with him and tell him your plans and hear out his.|`|PT4InZXlaa	i say do something like the strip tease ..buy a wig and show up some where in public to meet him dressed sexy(not trashy).see his reaction most men like that.then discuss what else he might like|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Are you really sure you're 22?<br>  <br>  Because stripping, dancing and role-playing are NOT considered kinky by most adults.<br>  <br>  Not sure what would make you think benign activities like that are kinky...|`|NuUdCz0Laa	The stuff you described is not that kinky, so I'm sure your fiance would love to watch or take part in any of those activities.  But sweetie, you need to be able to feel free to talk to this man, he going to be your husband soon, so open up and let him know that your more adventurous than he first thought.  Good luck and have fun.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	You have to do it gradually to not freak him out. Open communications about sex, your likes and dislikes need to be shared with your life partner. You need to know what turns each of you on and off to have a good relationship. You can watch a few soft core porno flicks depicting your fetishes to soften the blow. You never know, these things that turn you on may also be a turn on for your fiance.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	chacnes are if he is a guy he will be into it. Just ask him one night when you are goofing off getting ready to ummm make love , ask him if he minds yo udoing something kinky, chances are he will love it!|`|8PDzaAJcaa	stripping, dancing and maybe even role playing are so not issues for men, I am sure he will be into it|`|0d0W0nbVaa	question is,  are you 18+?
DyEIc0K8aa	Right! I'm sure you don't get to do anything... you poor little thing. Just how old are you, little one.|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	HIYA CHANTELLE, im a mother of 3 grown up girls, so i know were you are coming from....your mum loves you to bits,and does not want to see you make the same mistakes as her.she says you can't do this or that's, it for your own good. where you can't see no harm in doing some think,she can see where its leading to,so she says no.it is so you don't get hurt.you are had that age now,when you think you knows best,and no other girl has do it.but what ever you want to do,your m um has done it.and knows how things turn out.so she says no.all teenager girls fight with there mums,so you are not on your own.my daughter's treat be like there older sister,and come to me for answers.as they know im older and wiser,so i will know what to do.  try talking to your mum,and treat her like a older sister,or your best mate.it does work.good luck.|`|b94cb04c4184739772bf1ca1f1903304aa	It's completely normal to fight with your mother! Trust me i did it for years, i then moved out and realised that she was right about 90% of what we fought about! <br>  Mother's are trying to protect you from a lot of horrible things, people and experiences. They sometimes come across as evil but they are really trying to look out for you and have your best interests at heart. <br>  Try not to act out when you are frustrated, try to talk to her about what upsets you...in short try to act like a responsible person and demonstrate that you will make good choices and you may find that she eases off a bit!|`|ae282ad4a748f8c85406e4649235ff16aa	It's par for the course. You'll look back when you are 20 and wonder what the fuss was all about. She doesn't hate you, she's trying to protect you from the big bad world. It's a dangerous place for teenagers. Sit down for ten minutes and see your world through her eyes. Write down what you see and give it to your Mum in a Thank You for looking out for me card, Give her a hug.|`|WH67wz9Eaa	If you don't mind me asking, how old are you???<br>  I think you need to have a sit down with your mother and explain to her calmly how you feel. In my opinion i think your mother is just being protective and looking out for her daughter, most mothers are like this.|`|X9RzaTy7aa	But I would never eat the crusty snot....just the juicy ones...but not too juicy...more slimey...know what I mean.

btNUf7rcaa	I emailed the Pleasantdale Chateau in West Orange, they are $$$$ according the knot (not that i can afford it but i wanted to see what $$$$ meant) and they quoted me at like 250 per plate.<br>  The Castle place looks very nice, and its $$$ so I can assume it would be like 150 - 180 per plate. I got a quote from "The Imperia" which is rated $$$ and that was 150 for a Sat night. So I hope that can give you an estimate.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	if they won't work with you over the phone, that's disrespectful of your time.  forget them because it sounds like that's the way they'll act through the whole planning process.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Its northern NJ, I'd guess at least $80 per plate, most likely higher.<br>  <br>  But if you call or e-mail them they will probably send you information that will give you an idea of if they are in your price range.  I had to do that with several venues I was curious about.<br>  <br>  Edit - When they say they want to set an appointment, tell them you want to ensure you aren't wasting their time or yours and you need to know if they are in your price range or remotely close to it - Ask what their starting rates are per plate and tell them if they are in your price range you will set an appointment.<br>  <br>  I tried to check theknot for you and I don't see a listing for them so its going to be pretty tough getting a ballpark price.  Sorry :(|`|efxYtM69aa	I saw their website and fell in love with the place, but they were totally outside of our budget.  So i'm pretty sure they were at least $100.00 or more.  I want to say that I even heard $120.00 per person, but I can't say for sure because I called so many places.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Not sure, but I went to a wedding there and it was so beautiful!  Call them and ask.  I'm sure they also have a website.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Why don't you try calling them and ask?
uBssj3Znaa	having sex won't make you feel desired or liked. You will eventually end up feeling used. These boys who want to have sex with you, only want sex. You should lose your virginity to someone who actually cares about you.|`|grPckwSsaa	YOU ARE 17, 17!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  i lost my virginity to a guy i knew well, but he did it purely for sex, and i regret it to this day<br>  <br>  your time isnt running out, wait till you love someone... get a grip|`|AA11923501	I had sex at ninteen just to not be a virgin and have regretted it for forty years.Please wait till you are with someone you think you might want to spend the rest of your life with.Its not like you are twenty-five.Your not a freak.Throwing your virginity away for no reason might qualify you as one.Good Luck with your decision whatever it is.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	You are seventeen. SEVENTEEN. You are still a baby! You haven't lived even a fifth of your life.. <br>  <br>  Trust me, you'll regret it forever if you go and have sex with some guy who is using you for sex just to "get it over with". I am 21 and just recently lost my virginity. It is not a big deal at all, and I am so thankful that I waited for someone who truly loves me instead of giving it up to some random person.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	OMG NO WAIT TILL THE GUY THAT LOVES YOU!|`|HfTbzv32aa	no...... wait for the right one...... he will come along|`|kRPKG7Nmaa	No. Its okay to wait you know.<br>  A lot of the populars at my school wait.<br>  Its looked down upon to have sex that much.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't have a one night stand just to feel desired. You will meet this guy and look back and think that you should have waited for him, but instead you had sex with some guy you barely knew at the time just to feel wanted for a night.|`|jLKcuMNraa	thats probably the worst way to lose it. you are going to regret it. guys dont like sluts. sure they will want to have sex with you but no repectable guy wants to be in a relationship with a **** and once word goes around that you are then like you said you will be lonely. sex is not the answer to everything.|`|t5N9QQntaa	you are still so very young, your not going to die if you dont have sex, think about it this way if you dont care then do it if you want it to a Special thing then wait for a person who likes you for you not just for you looks.  and dont just follow the crowd cause they are doing it, your turn will come.|`|c4afc2644a5a2043a46205bd8ddd18a5aa	ur virginity is the single most important thing in your life. time is not running out, u have plenty of time to experience life. u should worry about more important things like college and a great career. ur not a freak, ur unique and being a virgin makes u that much more unique than others. sounds to me like ur pretty smart and will know when ur ready.|`|d8uJaLXYaa	You're 17... your youth's not slipping away from you... o.O<br>  Wait for someone who cares.. one-night-stands are just basically people using each other as objects. Nothing wrong with them, but don't lose your virginity in one if you can help it..|`|TFO6PMeDaa	i totally get where u coming from. i lost my virginity when i was 17 and the guy was 26. i only did it 2 make him like me and i wanted 2 feel accepted. now iam 19 and i totally regret it. the guy turned out 2 be a total jerk and loosing it him just me grow feelings for him but he didn't wanna be with me. i was soo hurt and i haven't had sex since then. i was i had my virginity back :-(. the moral of the story is just 2 wait. u have ur whole life ahead of u don't rush nothing wait till u find the rite guy that luvs u. besides sex is not all that great ur not really missing out on much lol|`|ee5MawLdaa	Girl u do not wanna do that. And ur not a freak for being a virgin. Some girls might call u that cuz they are jealous that you have something they dont . . . .its something special that you gata loose to someone special. Dont just "get it over with" you will regret that later in life. Ur only 17 your youth is not slipping out. . . .ur just starting to live. You have a life ahead of you. :)|`|xQJIxEwGaa	hell yes, its your life, do with it what you want.  Just use protection, sex isn't that sacred to wait for marriage or the right guy... it's just sex.  Don't listen to these idiots above me, they probably all lost there virginity at a young age, and there having sex, so its easy for them to tell you not to, I mean the guy of your dreams may never come until your 40, and half these people aren't in a relationship with the person they lost there virginity too.  True love is not forever.|`|XgxW3as5aa	If you want to feel young and desired and your willing to lose your virginity to anyone then you might as well auction it off! Hey you'll feel young and desired and be rich lol. Their was a girl on the tyra show who was auctioning her virginity and I'm not sure if she has already but the highest bidder was at 3 million dollars!!! She was 21 though. But hey if you wait a more year you can be rich lol|`|PQwRl27Jaa	thats dum thing 2 do u should save ur self for when u find someone u love n care for sex is alot better when u love someone.|`|r5c5pIyZaa	no way. wait, trust me.|`|YF3keXdMaa	People all have different opinions such as ' Wait until you find your soul mate but how long will that take? My opinion is you should just wait until your in an actual relashionship and it feels right. But don't be pressured seriously you'll regret it. And your 17 NOT 70 17 is still very young you basically still only a teen, Dont follow the crowd. Mix with people and meet other people to find nice boys. If they directly ask for sex thats all they want it's obviouse there not looking for a relashionship, they could just be looking for some one night stand whilst there wifes or girlfriends are at home. DONT RUSH Your life is still ahead of you.
lIpjuMTHaa	Have you had trust issues before this? How long have you been together and do you think he has the capability of cheating? I think you need to sit him down and tell him how much this is bothering you. Tell him you would rather just know than sit around looking like a fool.|`|SiniSj1eaa	those are shared washers and dryers..how do you know it wasnt already in there when you put your clothes in and you just didnt notice. People leave things behind all the time at laundry mats.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	It could have been left behind...I sometimes get other's people's socks and underwear in my laundry.|`|77ZVd5hyaa	Maybe someone else left it behind.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Sounds like it was left behind.|`|AA11460234	"multiple shared washers and dryers"<br>  <br>  <br>  There's your answer as to where it came from.<br>  <br>  Yet with that fact and a reasonable explanation about it's existence, you get your panties in a bunch and wonder if he's screwing around. Or not. because you can't prove anything.<br>  <br>  Listen dummy..... here's the formula.<br>  <br>  Laundry....yours and his.<br>  Laundry room, shared washers and dryers.<br>  Other women in the building and using the machines.<br>  You're both together almost all the time.<br>  <br>  And lady....unless your boyfriend is a real idiot (like some of the pecker heads out there), you don't crap in your own nest. In other words, if you're going to throw one into a broad and want to keep that from the wife or girlfriend, you don't give it to her in your own apartment that you share with the wife or SO.<br>  <br>  Think woman...think. Its logic and what a reasonable and prudent person can deduce.|`|UwNKFSBeaa	I doubt he's cheating on you, I mean he did clean your entire apartment, plus I've ended up with other people's clothing in my laundry basket in college and didn't notice it until I had gotten home. Let it go, it sounds like he's crazy about you!|`|TZpFcx47aa	Most likely it was stuck in the dryer from another "washer-user-person". Let it slide, i used to pull all sorts of crazy things out of my laundry when i shared machines. Lost a bra once too. Pissed me off. Let it slide.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	yeah, how do you know it wasn't in the dryer already. Just this time trust your man. Don't let something that could be nothing ruin what you have. If something else comes up in the future, then maybe I'd start getting worried.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Trust your gut!  If it was me, I would let it go and chalk it up to shared laundry.  But just make the mental note in case there was something going on.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	"my boyfriend and I were doing laundry together in the laundry room of our apartment building, where there are multiple shared washers and dryers."<br>  <br>  Keep rereading the above quote until you consider the possibility that an article of clothing belonging to someone else could have possibly been mixed in with yours. It has happened to me several times as well as other people I know. Also, try asking in the polls and surveys section if someone has ever lost an article of clothing in a public or shared laundry facility. And ask if anyone has found an article of clothing not belonging to them after using a public or shared laundry facility.
jLLkSWyiaa	you want to date a virgin? or what i syour question??

OcYXeEAbaa	You sound like your doing a great job. He's your little brother, and you obviously want him to be great and do awesome things. Just try and remember that he is only 18, and he's kind of figuring out who is. You can encourage him to dream big, and have a passion for something, but like you said, your his brother. I have four younger brothers, and I know what you mean, so I speak from experience. You've already shown him that you'll be there for him, and he knows that. Just continue to support him, and show him that you respect him. You might have already done this, but ask him what he wants to do in the long, he might start looking at life differently. Well, I hope everything works out.|`|be0YaDUPaa	Sounds like you are doing a pretty good job.  All you have to do is try to understand when it is appropriate to advise, and when it is appropriate to just let him find his own way.  You don't have to be perfect, just make sure he knows you are there for him regardless of whether he occasionally makes decisions with which you disagree.|`|s7seaaPkaa	he's a teenager hes allowed to do the crazy things now.<br>  hes still a kid leave him alone.<br>  the more you hold him back from things he wants to do hes gonna want to go them more.<br>  its his decision what he wants to do.<br>  not yours what so ever.<br>  i know how it feels to want more than any thing for your younger sibling to make something of his self.<br>  but their going to do what they want.<br>  not everyone grows up to be a "electrical engineer and a real estate agent on the side"|`|Eug52iQDaa	You love him but don't respect him.  At 18 he needs guidance, but should be seeking his own path.  Few respond to being forcefully led.  Most respond to gentle guidance.  It may be that he occasionally rebels against the structured path you set for him.  Think about it.  It doesn't appear that you will both go down the same path.  Examine whether you can accept that he is choosing a different way.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	You seem to have covered all the "angles" yourself. If anything, I would suggest for you to stop "parenting" and be a brother. It is not your place to "parent" him. That job would go to your parents.Nothing wrong with caring and suggesting things, but if he is getting mad at you, you may be over stepping your bounds.<br>  p.s. I have an older brother and we fought every day of youth.<br>   Good luck and have a great day!
YvgHnIBGaa	First of all I don't take those words for a joke at all...those words were said to me and I thought it was a joke until the guy showed up at my door with a gun, rope,black gloves,  and plastic bad.. I put on an ack just to take his mind away from what he was thinking and after it settled down he sat on the edge of my bed and say if you didn't calm me down like you did I actually came here to kill you shoot u wrap u up in a bag and leave u... so please don't take that for granted...<br>  <br>  Now when me and family is chilling together and someone say Im going to kill u it's not serious or if your close friend you knew since you were young say it then mayb u don't have to b so uptight but this is someone u don't know and if they have info to find u then don't play like that or let him know say .. we cool and all but don't play with those words!
DQ0DONV2aa	personally, i'd hate it and i wouldn't want my girl friend doing that but i trust her not to do anything with the guy but if they did end up having an affair or a fling or something, i wouldn't be happy at all, i'd be really angry|`|u7o75zipaa	I'd be okay with it because I completely trust my bf. If I couldn't trust him, what would be the point of being with him.<br>  Plus, I'm really close to my best friend, who is a guy, and although nothing has ever happened between us, we spent a lot of time alone together. My bf is totally cool with it so for me to turn around and complain about him spending time with a girl friend would be very hypocritical.<br>  <br>  Although, if he was spending a lot of time with an ex, I'd probably be a bit jealous and insecure. I would just speak to him to make sure nothing was happening.<br>  <br>  You could try befriending the friend of the bf/gf though.. they're probably going to be around a lot.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	i think you shouldn't mind about that. yeah; you're gonna be a bit jealous but you can't split up two best friends. you really need to let him do what he wants with his best friend; but if you start getting all jealous and posessive - he is going to get pretty annoyed. best friends before girlfriends and boyfriends anyday; and you can't be jealous about this one. i don't think it's bad. you will start to make his best friend feel uncomfortable, and even your boyfriend will start to get pretty annoyed. don't interfear with best friends please; just - don't go there :)|`|AA11899313	Why is it 'bad'?<br>  <br>  Why is it not 'Good' that two people can be simply 'friends'.<br>  <br>  My longest living friend, and we have known each other for about 30 years, is female, and we are simply 'Friends'.  There has never been anything 'romantic' in our relationship at all.<br>  <br>  So, it is possible.<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|wH9EdF7naa	id be upset and tell my bf or gf that its some bullcrap... but on the other hand, if its a best friend, u shud get to know that person, then maybe u wudnt feel as jealous or upset about it.<br>  <br>  im just a very jealous person, so i immediately would tell my bf/gf that it aint cool.|`|QS3PtXg8aa	id b ok with it as long as i new exactly wat they did|`|8QCOSlNvaa	i wouldnt be happy. i would tell him how you feel about it. if he don't stop then its not worth it|`|g8HVHqPuaa	umm....from experience, it's very bad! i was dating a guy for about 3 months when i found out his ex was just getting out of prison. He said they were better off friends and was really close to her and her family. He considered her his best friend. They would hang out occasionally when i went out with my friends and i didn't think anything of it. but eventually things got weird and he spent more and more time with her. eventually it tore us apart and we broke up after about 7 months. later i found out he had been cheating on me. When I thought he was at work, he was with her. He had even gotten his own apartment while we were still together and i didn't have a clue! Best friends of the opposite sex is rarely ever "just friends". The sad thing is, is that when he WAS around he was wonderful and kept telling me not to worry. Guys have a way of making you second guess yourself but always trust your gut. If you think something is up something probably is.|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	I'm a jealous woman. That would bother me. There are certain boundaries that are not to be crossed. Of course you can trust your boyfriend or girlfriend but people are merely flesh and blood and have desires and needs. I would explain to my BF that I didn't appreciate him being alone with her and that it was disrespectful towards me and ask him how he would feel if the tables were turned.|`|70a47f94503a1953542e060626fbb52caa	You may not like my answer but it is honest and a fair one for both you and your boyfriend. Your boyfriend has the right to have other friends. The fact that he told you about his friendship with his ex means that he respects you and cares for you and wants you to trust him. He trust and respect you and you should trust and respect him. Now I can understand that you may feel uneasy about him being friends with his ex girlfriend but the easiest way to ruin a happy relationship is to demand that he does not see her again. He will do it, but it will create ill feeling and you will feel guilty that you ask him to do this. Why don't you suggest that all three of you go out together the next time he plans to meet her. Just a few times  will do the trick and it will send a rather mature message to suggest that you are fine with the friendship and you are even happy to spend time with her and you may even make a friend. If they are not keen to have you come along to their outings then you worry!!<br>  I hope this has help and if you don't like the answer then I am sorry but take care anyway and all the best.|`|fZfVM1unaa	It's human nature to feel jealous and suspicious in such situations.  It is possible that your BF/GF is not getting everything that they want or need from you.  I highly recommend going out with them, or even better, inviting along an even larger group.  You should tell them how you feel, it would be foolish to let it slide, even if it's innocent...  which it never is.|`|f75x8aI3aa	I don't think it's bad, but i would be a bit jealous/ worried as they have been together in the past. Talk your partner about it, but don't let your insecurities ruin your own relationship, it's unlikely he'll stop seeing his friend, if they've been friends before you were around.|`|0J2l2rzbaa	my best mate is a boy and we go town together most weeks and my bf is fine with it! (: <br>  trust me i would never do any think with him, i just get along with boys better! <br>  so yer i think its fine.|`|NZVP15Soaa	this must be a modern way of two timing<br>  don't put up with it- you don't know if they<br>  are laughing behind your back<br>  end it<br>  <br>  take care|`|HOVvKqxsaa	i wouldnt mind as long as they are just friends|`|3PF3lt5Qaa	You've got to trust him and give him the benefit of the doubt.  At the end of the day he's with YOU cos he chooses to be, if he wanted to be with her then he would be.<br>  <br>  I think if you cause a scene it's more likely to cause problems in your relationship.  Be mature about it and get to know her.  Once you know her better you'll be able to see their friendship for what it is.<br>  <br>  I know it can be abit upsetting and maybe make you anxious, but i'm sure you have friends of the opposite sex, doesn't mean you love your bf any less and i'm sure it's the same for him.

How many times do you hug and kiss him.  I bet he has been like this from the time you started dating.  Do onto him as you wish him to do unto you.<br>  <br>  It may just because he doesn't know how to act around a pregnant woman.  <br>  <br>  Regardless he is the boys father and has the right to be in the child's life 100%.  A person could be a terrible spouse and still be a wonderful parent.|`|CuJjdTVXaa	They say the first year is the hardest for many reasons. Having a baby on top of that just makes it even harder. If you can't come to some kind of understanding then perhaps it's time to move on but if your husband can see the light and at least ACT LIKE A HUSBAND then maybe the two of you have a chance. Marriage is a two way street that needs both parties to be together in everything so until he can join you then you might just be better off going your separate ways and utilizing a loving family to get you through it....good luck|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Surprise. You got married because you were pregnant and it is not working out. You can't force people to be good spouses. I'm sure he was this way before you got married only now it matters more. If you need affection from him to be happy then you will never be happy. You can not change anyone but yourself. I'd say cut your losses and leave now. Why be miserable and bring your child into a sad situation.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Divorce is not a option. Work it out. communication is the key to any successful marriage. You are a family and he needs to take care of your needs, tell him that a man hates to hear he cant meet his womans needs. It will be a shocker and hopefully he will come around.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	He's probably harboring resentment.  He just got married and has to support the both of you plus another very soon.  Have you considered his feelings?  Maybe he was hoping for marriage and some newlywed fun; life plans including purchasing a home and then have kids farther down the line...Instead - he's newly married, sole support for his pregnant wife, (you don't work - why?????) and has a baby on the way.  He's not enjoying being a newlywed - he's dealing with a new marriage and a hormonal wife...plus mounting responsibilities.  Who wouldn't be stressed beyond all belief?<br>  <br>  Consider him and his feelings - not just yours and what you want...|`|wia9SXCPaa	I hate to say it but you should probably get out while you can.  You answered your own question by saying the bit about 5 years down the road.<br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|AA11946390	Sooooo... he wasn't like this BEFORE you two got married?|`|AA11207703	This is most unfortunate only being married 4 months to each other. Did he start acting this way soon after you got married? If he didn't want to marry you why did he. Does he not realize your carrying his baby that's made from the both of you. You need to talk with him and get him to go to a counsellor. Not sure why he is acting this way. Guess he wants to lose you and his baby because no one should live like this when they are married. He must have serious mental issues! Get his attention and let him no you mean it  when you say I'm leaving you because of your neglect toward me as your wife. This will either force him to change his ways, or you and baby will have to move on. Sorry to hear of this sad situation. Cocoa

I was pretty pissed off.<br>  <br>  At first I wanted to get revenge of some sort the way you're talking about, but then I realised I have better things to do with my time then to think about negative things.  You doing it to him will not change that he did it to you and will not change that you felt humiliated, etc.  All it will really be it one more negative thing.  On top of feeling humiliated and angry, you'll also be just as mean and petty as him.  Cut your losses now, don't add anymore negative to your life.  <br>  Simply announce to your friends at school "well, I could humiliate him in the same way, but that would just make me as big a jerk as he is, and I'm not interested in being a jerk, I'm better than that"  (admittedly, this is kind of cheating, because it allows you to be the bigger person, while sort of getting revenge by proclaiming him a jerk in a very convincing way in front of everyone)|`|3cc0bb5250e11cfef994352f4e9a5e7aaa	Grow up!!!!|`|467bc04784d2334db261431d62597659aa	try ignoring him in school. sorry but i also have problems in school like that and i cant seem to solve it also. i just know that someday he will stop being an immature jerk|`|AA12280820	hahahahaha<br>  aahahahaha <br>  <br>  hahaha<br>  <br>  oh my God this is funny <br>  <br>  aha hhaahahhahahahah<br>  <br>  well I can put up a site in about 24hrs for you if you like just send me the specifications you need.<br>  <br>  ahhahaha hahaha sorry <br>  What was that site..hahaha oooh hahahaha<br>  pliz send me the name of that site a hahaahha<br>  oh my ribs|`|AA12392663	dont do tha same back, and dont do anything too drastic cos it'll bite you in the @ss<br>  <br>  i'd send him a small virus, or google search his name, find the websites hes on and see if theirs anything embarassing on their.<br>  <br>  it'll all blow over at school, dont worry aboot that|`|eb5d8771d5190567ce413ee3a7cfafecaa	TELL ALL THE PEOPLE AROUND HIS BIGGEST SECRET!

Concentrate on yourself better and try to overcome your own tribulations before worrying about others, even if he is your Ex. <br>  <br>  The way you written this, it sounds like you want to control him. Whether is true or not, just let him go and let him and his own family resolve his issues. I do not feel you are in a good position to try to offer help when you are in a dubious shape yourself. <br>  <br>  Try to research for resources you can turn and your own family to get through your own issues and let him go. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|74d8704d3b9fcff9814b477383d60eafaa	I'm deff. not reading that whole thing...<br>  But you can't get addicted to pot.<br>  It's just, he wants it more then you.<br>  Will you not let him smoke?<br>  If so, then why not?? lol|`|4EWCegiRaa	I'm sorry but pot's not addicting.

They may be on an actual harder drug, you should look into that, but befoer doing so, you need to get your emotional problems in check. <br>  <br>  By the way, if you "tell" your ex will hate you forever.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	You are welcome, and I hope you are getting the help and support you need to deal with your own issues.<br>  BTW - Pot is NEVER gonna help you out of depression! Have you ever seen an energetic stoner? Is your ex Mr. Busy?<br>  As far as an intervention goes, you can try, but your authority in this case is very limited by your own diagnosis, the fact that you do not currently have the respect of his family and the fact that you are his Ex.<br>  I'd work behind the scenes and see if some of his friends can lead the charge.<br>  Good luck, friend.
DiBAWKPsaa	Wow, you have gone through some stuff with this guy. Right well it seems pretty obvious he still likes you, the Myspace stalking, you being the only one who can call him by his first name, calling you up, apologizing.. it seems like he wants to put things right between you, but it's the drugs he is taking that is going to his head. Try and get him sorted out if you want to, talk to him about the drugs, find substitutes for them, get him back of those 2 days because he will regret it later on when he can't get a good job.

At this stage just keep friendship with her and don't run behind her looking for whether she loves you or not,if she does so she will give you hints in the process itself.You will have to show patience at beginnig but needed you can change your strategy because after all "everything is fair in love and war."|`|K4IaWDZnaa	Sachin, first of all wht u've gotta do is make friendship wid her she wants 2 but she wants 2 take it slow ,yeah!!! it seems tht she likes u but she is either a little shy about it or she is giving you hints so u go ahead make frndship with her talk to her be goooood frnds then ,,,,,, u may ask her ! good luck!|`|JmYAd1PGaa	She probably does but she seems to want to take it slow. She's trying to start off as friends, hence the book as a topic. Don't ask her out right away, just try to get to know her better... especially since you seem to have a lot in common.|`|dgfehmEoaa	probably|`|KchNxZ6yaa	No Or Thats Sick|`|ACgiEEeaaa	yup|`|1NVMAxgUaa	grow some juevos|`|U65DKM73aa	seems so. go out and talk to her. thats the only way to find out.
b4WxO5fxaa	goin back with any ex is questionable..well people can change but you should be skeptical|`|gsW5jVbtaa	seems like it. or maybe she doens't want to live at home with her parents anymore.|`|707gOCvbaa	Time will tell. As of now the both of you have trust issues. Neither was honest and despite her getting mad at the text messages she saw, she had a few herself that had to of been initiated because what guys would know she was single? GO on your trip and have fun. Maybe things will be different this time around and for your sake I hope so. good luck.|`|xgJbxZgfaa	good idea- good luck|`|1BaeFYnEaa	It sounds like you're a bit uneasy in relationships. Translation: jealous. You want her back, but she went away because you made her feel bad. The main thing is to respect your girlfriend as you would any person (especially a loved one), no matter what you believe she's doing "behind the scene". If you have no proof, there's no point to accuse her of anything. That will only ruin the relationship, because it brings negative feelings. Think really well about what kind of a girl she is. Would she really cheat on you? Is she that kind of person, who doesn't take anything serious? If she isn't then no worries. Is she happy with you? If she is, then again, no worries. You earn trust by trusting someone. You earn respect by respecting someone. If you treat her like a convict, she'll either leave you, or even start doing what you accuse her of doing. If she gave you the second chance to me it is clear she LOVES YOU!!! But she's SCARED of being HURT!!<br>  Be nice to her. Really! I don't think you have to worry so much about her doing nasty things!|`|NviCwaroaa	What is up? What did you just want drama in your life? Or to see if she really loved you? People are not games! You my friend are about to play the game of, Life Chess. You see women are very good at playing games once they know the rules. She wants to see if you changed you were verbally abusive, right? Look out you may have to throw down your,king. I do not understand gaming, I do not game anymore but if I get gamed watch me play. Listen to the words, but watch and really see what she is saying. Women feel, men react you! Think about it how did the guys get the phone number to txt her not intiation on her part, really.|`|2sMYk9H7aa	Well if she is coming around again it seems to me like she's interested in giving you another chance. Because if she didn't want anything with you she would've just completely brushed you off.|`|IjkPBYlkaa	maybe shes doing the same thing as you are just to get you to care more but she will definitely give you another chance sounds like it?|`|Nc7clhzIaa	I'm not a pro at relationships, however, it's always good to admit your mistakes & it appears that you have acknowledged some of your faults.  Honesty is always the best policy with someone you care about.  The Florida trip sounds like a nice getaway to clear your mind & see where this relationship is going.  Eye contact is always good for clear, honest answers.  Flirting with others is never good for a relationship & neither is snooping.  It is hard & I have been guilty of that in the past, but people do change... If someone truly loves you, they will try to do the things that make you happy, under reasonable conditions of course.  Good Luck!

I had several friendships where I became better friends with the mom than the child which was my intial friend. They all resulted into chaos. I will give you some advice? Never forget who he is? He is the father of your girlfriend and despite the guitar jamming should be treated as such. Leave your gal out of conversations and do not talk about her behind her back. good luck kiddo;|`|xgJbxZgfaa	that's awesome to maintain a good friendship with your girls dad.|`|f21c4568248ded0eeab01a76d3a81476aa	Good, not necessary, but good.|`|TfLPRwFWaa	its cool unless you plan to dump her<br>  <br>  uhohh :P|`|YgSrgTFzaa	thats great! now her dad wont start yelling at you every time you walk into the door. My dad yells at every guy that comes through the door even if they r just friends lol.|`|t5N9QQntaa	That is cool that you could get along with her dad, but just remember you still have a girlfriend and even though you are jamming with dad she probably wants a little attention to.|`|e98RKB35aa	If you ignore your girlfriend then it is bad but if you just go there for her dad then that is strange. Just don't lose your friend over her dad.|`|M8fQiTsqaa	not at all hun<br>  <br>  it shows a good sense of social skills between you n her dad<br>  <br>  its good<br>  ul be in his good books too lol|`|SYrJiDKwaa	Just make sure that she doesn't mind. She might get jealous, and dump you.|`|Xu71saGaaa	Just dont spend more time with him than you do you gf.. she would get mad lol|`|iD8z7KZBaa	It is ok|`|T2o9ptUlaa	that's a great relationship right there|`|5e14c31a3045fe59c0b780a5ca6b7a9daa	if my boyfriend was good friends with my dad, i would think that was kinda weird. lol <br>  but if she sees nothing wrong with it then their shouldn't be a problem with it... but if she does have a problem with it, then you should be concerned... just make sure your being fair to her... if your at her house all day and are just hanging out with her dad, then that's not fair... just make sure you spend time with her too..........|`|bp6ud1AHaa	well its good but just be wit your girlfriend more than her dad lol cause she will start gettin mad trust me  my boyfriend used to come to my house supposably to be wit me but he would spend more time wit my brother...but yea it started getting me kinda mad but i talked to him about it and yea he is wit me most of the time now =]|`|EqG8KMQOaa	I guess that's cool. I might get annoyed at you. Because you are my boyfriend, not my dad's ya know? Plus there is supposed to be that seperation between you two. & what if you guys ever break up? The relationship with the dad is gone too. Be careful.|`|zbYBsFc3aa	it might make your girlfriend feel kind of jealous or mad because you'd rather spend time with her dad and not her, but if she's ok with it, it's a good thing. most boyfriends' don't get along with their girlfriend's dad's.|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Lol kinda funny. It's good though. My girlfriend and my mom are good friends. They text all the time. It's annoying for me, probably is for your gf as well.|`|5ZwuIVPdaa	its not bad just dont make it more about him than her. its great to be friends with him that means the parents like u now all u have to do is win her heart and EVERY1 WILL LOVE U!!!!|`|eRWVOozHaa	It's good until you want to break up.|`|hIwJxNVkaa	ya its good.. as long as you dont break up with her.. lol

Say what you mean, mean what you say, you know?  People find a no BS person to be refreshing, for the most part, and annoying if they have anything they are trying to hide.  I'm the guy people love, or love to hate, depending on what sort of person they happen to be.  Sound familiar?<br>  And I make people laugh...that never hurts one's standing in people's opinions, either.  <br>  PEACE
uBssj3Znaa	you don't have to get along with him as he isn't your boyfriend. Stay out of the way and let them date. Just because they are dating doesn't mean they will get married.|`|707gOCvbaa	You will meet plenty of people in your lifetime that you cannot tolerate, but he is her boyfriend and she deserves your respect in treating him fair., You also have no idea where the relationship is heading and if they would get married. Your sis is dating the guy so whether you have anything in common with him is not your business. Leave them be and allow your sister to have some joy in her life. One day the shoe might be on the other foot and then what? You'll be okay.|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	The best thing to do is find out what he is interested in and plan to do something involving it so that he and your sister can see that your making an effort to like him. Maybe that can work if not confront your sister and see if she can help you two to bond as friends. The only thing that you really need to worry about with your sister's bo is that he treats her right. Now if your the older sibling then tell him that you need to make sure that he is a great guy for your sister. If your the younger then tell your sis that you would like to know what kind of guy he is so she don't get hurt.|`|dixO8N8kaa	is there something about him specifically you don't like. maybe find out why your sister likes him so much. maybe the two of you(you and the bf) can go out to lunch to get to know each other.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to make an effort to try and like him or find a solid reason your sister shouldn't be with him then stay out of it. it's your sister's life and she has to choose for herself.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	You should be happy for your sister and try to learn to like him. Nothing hurts more than to have to choose between you and her boyfriend.|`|SvHr19zJaa	If your sister is happy then you should be too. It isnt like as if you're going to have to spend the rest of your life with him! right ?|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	Plenty of inlaws don't get along with each other.  It isn't about what you have in common with him, it's about your sisters happiness and what she has in common with him.  Just stay out of their relationship.  If they end up breaking up because of something you say or do she will probably never forgive you.|`|YgSrgTFzaa	Leave them be unless he does something to hurt your sister then you can yell, scream, wutever u want to him. rofl!|`|rQVA71Vkaa	tell her how u feel bout em

mbvpWNMeaa	His immigration status is irrelevant if he does not answer the complaint.  If he were fully participating it might cause delays because of his need to get travel documents to come to the U.S. for court.

You can do research online, but I suggest that you go to a bridal boutique to actually try on and purchase the dress.  It's a major purchase and it will be a big part of making you feel beautiful and comfortable on your big day!  Do a web search of bridal shops in your area and either find out online or call and find out if they are in your price range.  When you find some that do have dresses in your price range, print off a picture of this dress and take it with you.. bridal shops have salespeople that can be a huge help in matching you up with the dress of your dreams.  I took in a picture of a dress that I liked to a local bridal shop and they found a very similar one that looked great on me and was in my price range.  And it was their house label, so I wouldn't have been able to find one like it online.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bKK2fPiVaa	GORGEOUS dress... but not to rain on your parade or anything... no one gets the dress they think they want!

b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	Why people engage in wishful thinking confounds me. She's an ex. She's with someone. She hasn't broken with that someone. That someone is going away. There is no 'another try' here. She's using you for something. Probably an emotional crutch to deal with her someone going away. Steer clear of her.|`|eA817mGoaa	she is keeping you in reserve.|`|wo8B7hnOaa	she's keeping you in a reserve.  since she knows that you still have feelings for her, she's using that to get what she wants or in her opinion what she needs while her bf is away.  move on.  you can do a hell of a lot better.  Sorry about all of this.

qKpgMkjSaa	omg when she's on top when she plays with her t*** or she likes it when I smack her *** (I really like too if I'm on top) Oh or when during sex she stops, pulls out my d*** and starts sucking on it. nothing gets me off more during oral sex... then either 69 position...sometimes it feels too good for her and she cant concentrate on me lol...or when were both getting ourselves off by watching the other one. (the last one requires you to be really confident and trusting with the other one in order for you BOTH to enjoy it. <br>  <br>  Oh also, obnoxious moaning is stupid and I cant concentrate. it breaks my rythm haha<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|PY160XO7aa	Age please?|`|scnW0Wzeaa	When she is screaming in ecstasy during my sexual conquest.|`|EayT8T5Gaa	WATH TURNS MY HUSBAND ON THE MOST IS WHEN <br>  WE HAVE ORAL SEX OR JUST WEAR SEXXY CLOTHEEES|`|4l2q4n1Baa	Nibbling on his ear (and him nibbling mine)  ALWAYS works.

AA11646252	if you live where you can get around without a car then live on your own.  look for a good cheap car and have it looked over before you get it with no payments and put up a litte every week for another car or repairs.  can find some nice good cars for a month or twos rent.  then just real cheap insurance.  never get a car with payments interest is what keeps people in trouble.  if you buy all outright your money will go further.<br>  <br>  rd|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Live own my own.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Alone.

DtUy1IFmaa	I would move on.  If a girl likes you she will take her friend's advice into consideration but she'll still go out with you if she really likes you.  She may be using her friends as an excuse.  If this isn't the case then she's obviously someone who doesnt have enough backbone to make her own decisions about who she dates.  She seems like the type of person where you'll end up dating her....and her friends.  Find someone who likes you no matter what her friends say.|`|UgcPxd4maa	If she is going to let her friends influence her feeling for you, then you don't wanna be with her anyway. You can find someone better!
71EwzPSlaa	you cant be in a serious relationship without trust...its the most key attribute to the relationship and if he cant trust what you say then you guys are going to continue to fight and bicker....what you both need to do is take a break from eachother and grow up a little and see if he changes his outlook on your past.....just a suggestion|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Tell him that if he keeps beating a dead horse then it's over.|`|rfztzwvHaa	I have the same issues right now. He comes up with rediculous delusions that when i hang out with my friends something will happen, or that I don't care about him anymore. I have no idea what to tell you. I just think that maybe he is the one with the issues he needs to overcome, tell him you love him and nothing could change that but he seriously needs to overcome his fears because they're hurting your relationship. ask him if he trusts you. good luck to you.|`|GkPeIQ9Maa	I understand this being that my relationship is the same as yours except Im your guy and your my man..<br>  <br>  Ill tell it the way I see it to help you understand his head..<br>  <br>  To me, Ive seen a lot of what looks to be like "Red Flags Of Cheating" and am torn between blind trust and going with what I feel in my gut..<br>  <br>  I cant stand that I always accuse but also don't want to be played later on that I was nothing but a fool..<br>  <br>  If you keep completely consistent in what you do on a daily basis then this will get lower and lower..<br>  <br>  I think your cheating if I see what looks to be your actions out of place from how you always are and being your other half, I notice ever last detail about you..<br>  <br>  I hope that this helps you..<br>  <br>  Now if this goes on forever and 9 million something years then its time to say goodbye to your guy as my guy will have to do the same..|`|2IK3PvAEaa	This is a relationship that doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  If you can't trust the person you are with then why be with them at all?  Truthfully...his insecurities are not your problem.  It may be a difficult decision but my suggestion is move on.|`|uhZneNORaa	try to sit down and talk serriously about your issues. And explain that if things go on like this you wont be able to be with him anymore. That he either has to trust you and move on or just find someone else..|`|7SzADsVSaa	What you need to do is tell him, and be open with him about your feelings. It seems cliche, but the only way to really repair this is communication. You can't have a relationship without trust, so you have to be honest with him about everything. Sit him down, and explain to him that you are not attacking him, that you don't want to fight, you love him, and you want to work through this. Tell him how you feel even if it might not be what he wants to hear at first. <br>    If you are open and honest with him, he will be open and honest back. And hopefully you will learn to trust each other again, because trust is one of the key strengths in any relationship.
IpzapGwgaa	yes, the one in nyc is good, me being a teenager, i loved it when i was little, i always wanted one and my parents never let me spend money on one. it is very good though. lots of products and if you get a doll then you can have a tea party up in the tea party room with the other girls and their dolls. Have fun! I hope your little girl loves her new american girl!
AA11948687	you have to the right to be in his business he is a part of your life<br>   and i think you should ask because you have a right to know if he is doing that to you and you are sad about it then you don't need to hold it in  holding your feeling in is only going to make it hurt worse and then instead of nicely talking about it  its going to come out at the wrong time just sit  him down and be like hey i don't appreciate this and let him know how you feel you are not wrong for this!|`|AA11231166	I think you should approach him about it.  If he has nothing to hide it shouldn't bother him.|`|AA12211869	if he loves you he should care ab your feelings. dont feel guilty, its your right. n dont be blinded by your love for him. life is too precious to be wasted on perverts. especially if you are sincerely in love. tell him you dont like it and how you really feel about it. be strong in your expression, dont be sorry or pleading. if he truly loves you he'll respect your feelings. if not, forget him.|`|cb43a9d41104a418ef186c4ce916bcfdaa	Bring it up!

The worst he will do or say is that he is being unfaithful. or he will deny it. if you are already suspecting , then there already red flags in your relationship. maybe you should ask yourself Is this what you want?|`|AA11780989	Listen to your gut feelings (always).  Call him out on it!!|`|AA12125695	It was bad to invade his privacy, absolutely.  You did not trust your bf, and now you cannot.  You are both in uncertainty, and your bf isn't ready for a committed relationship.  Why don't you be the one to suggest you both date others while in college.  That will give you the gracious exit!
AA11129848	You should talk to her. You should go out your way to make sure that you talk to her. Make sure its face to face. College is a very scary subject. My baby is going off to college and I'm scared it won't be the same either. I feel like me and her are going to fall apart as an couple. Me and her talk all the time about this subject. You just have to prove to her she is the only person you want. If y'all been friends for along time then this shouldn't break y'all up.|`|AA11687142	If the reality is that you are going to leave her, but you plan to still be with her (if you get together) Let her know that. But If your Not going to leave her let her know that!<br>  <br>  Either way be honest and either she will come around or she wont. All you can do is let her know the real and that way at least you have equipped her with the options to make an informed decision.!<br>  <br>  I wish you the BEST|`|AA12374314	just tell her that you guys can try it and if it doesnt work out then you guys can go back to being friends....GOOD LUCK...

99e1e15b4b286bbab4de97bebcf0219baa	Esa chica, si te cuenta todos sus secretos no quiere saber nada de ti como amante. Has ido de chico bueno con ella y has conseguido que ella te vea como un amigo. Si quieres tener alguna posibilidad con ella lo primero que tienes que hacer es alejarla de ti, romper esa confianza pero con estilo. No quiero decir que dejes de verla, sino que inventes alguna excusa que te permita dejar de ser su pa?o de lagrimas. Una vez hecho esto, lo que tienes que hacer es enamorarla y para eso hay que comportarse como un hombre y no como un inutil sumiso y que pierde el culo detras de ella y hace y dice todo lo que sabe que ella quiere. La tienes que volver loca, intrigarla, divertirla a la vez que juegas con ella. Unas veces la tratas muy bien y otras aparenta indiferencia, ya veras como con este juego se prende contigo. Pero no se te ocurra ser grosero ni maleducado con ella. Ten caracter, muestrate seguro de ti mismo y no dudes. Si tienes dudas ella te volverá a rechazar. Tu sólo te vas a dar cuenta si todo va bien. <br>  No hables mucho, sino simplemente saca temaS DE CONVERSACIóN Y DEJA QUE SEA ELLA LA QUE HABLE, tu sólo acompasa la conversación. No cuentes demasiado sobre ti, crea algo de intriga y de misterio.<br>  Una vez que empiezes a notar que ella está quedada contigo (Busca información sobre el lenguaje corporal del sexo o de las mujeres en internet, con eso aprenderas a saber la respuesta )<br>  tienes que intentar crear empatia entre ambos (imitando sus gestos y posturas corporales, su tono de voz, procurando utilizar al hablar las mismas palabras que habitualmente ella utiliza). Esto te puede llevar tiempo, no tengas prisa ni pienses en ello ni en besarla, ni nada de eso. Si lo haces bien caerá rendida, incluso aunque tenga novio.

But you can't just keep living your life unhappy. If your unhappy and don't feel the same then you need to stop things it's not fair to him or you.  Theres 2 ways you can settle this... Work out your problems tell him how you feel and maybe your problems will be fixed over time. Or  just break up with him,, if he really cares about you the way he says he does he should understand the fact that your not happy and want to see the best for you even if it hurts him.

AA11542946	yes, I just try to tell the person that their paranoid feelings are all in their head and there is nothing to worry about.....my brother is a paranoid schizophrenic and I think pretty much anybody who has paranoia to some degree is a little bit mental, for lack of a better word...I get paranoid too as a lot of people do.....I don't really have a reaction to it, I just try to comfort and go from there....my husband says that being paranoid is normal but assures me that I have nothing to be paranoid about....|`|AA11359525	i get paranoid sometimes. i have a bulletproof vest that cost $500. but i got it for free as a christmas present. i sleep with a knife next to my bed sometimes. sometimes when i go out, <br>  i put my vest on and carry a brast knuckle with me. i also look over my shoulders sometimes. i just want to stay safe. <br>  i don't want to get killed by some low life on the street. <br>  every one get paranoid sometimes.

dd6f4c3c09e0b9458ec564c26d25a0b2aa	I believe you can get power of attorney from your parents.  You can print the form off of the TX-DOT website and have your parents sign it.|`|AA10378559	It will require a temporary or conditional power of attorney, called a limited power of attorney, to transfer the title for the car to a new owner. This will stipulate exactly what powers you have to represent your parents in this sale only. You can initiate it with the proper form then send it to them with instructions for signing it with witnesses and signature of a notary. You may, according to your state's laws, have to register it at your county courthouse, which just makes it a matter of legal record.|`|AA11017231	Only if they give you power of attorney
AA12357983	If it doesn't matter, then why bring it up?  If he is, then cool, he will tell you in his own time.

It's his place to tell u, not yours to ask.|`|0f0bc47d7e045f036afa4db6a27df14caa	He may just be curious or something.  It would probably be helpful for him if you brought up the subject.  I'm sure he knows that you saw all those web addresses pop-up and is worried about what you are thinking.  It is best to just go ahead and get the conversation over with.  You will both feel better when you don't have this unknown between you anymore.|`|2d8716867bb461af44d3acc310edd3d1aa	u can wait for him to com out, or ask him, tell him that no matter what his answer is u will still be his best friend and will be there for him|`|32e654482c6148c0b399460caf758334aa	If he hasn't told you anything about visiting those sites or suggesting that he may be gay then maybe he doesn't feel comfortable telling you. Meaning it's his life, his business and no one else's. He may get really upset because he never wanted his best friend to know or anyone else for that matter.|`|AA10848200	dont worry about it|`|323ec7b0a519e535b6ab5fa8fdc425feaa	Well sites just apear out of no where, now if he searched for gay porn that would be a different thing. But how can you find out, hit him with a baseball bat and if he screams like a girl.. then he is GAY!@!!!|`|4d7c713ef93f9122cc415c32d8f40594aa	I think its best to approach your friend on this subject. I'd begin by showing him that you'll still be his best friend. Just show him he has no reason to feel uncomfortable. If its an issue of secrecy let him know that you won't tell anyone. It sounds simple to do but I know its hard. Trust a stranger, lol. And if he isn't gay then tell him someone is looking up gay porno on his computer. Best friends shouldn't be uncomfortable with sharing anything with each other.|`|6ce1e93d9a9c4d26509a2f15faf5a15caa	Dude, I'd talk to him about it.  I mean, I'm no pro or anything, but you're obviously an open minded person and will not shun him for being who he is.  If you are best buds, you should be able to share everything....including the fact that you are not interested, of course.  It's important to have open communication with friends.  And yes, I think it will totally help with any transition he might have.  I mean, I think a great weight would be lifted off of him....he doesn't have to keep a big secret like that from you anymore...and he can actually feel comfortable with talking to you.  I mean, it's gotta be rough, with so many people that don't accept it......Don't ya think he might need someone to just talk to and get that stuff off his chest every once in a while?  Gosh, it's gotta be hard to find someone he can trust to talk to that won't judge him.|`|900358ddaa47a4a5619f71eebdd62b76aa	Ask him. You can still be friends if he respects your right to be hererosexual. Many straight people have gay friends. Try not to develop homophobia.|`|9360c1bcf72f4e8e26041bd62bc7ada4aa	I think I would talk about it with him beacause i am gay and thats what I would want my friend to do<br>  hope i helped|`|AA11950794	He's you're best friend, you can talk anything with your best friend, why not bring it up?|`|AA12254420	i think i would leave it alone for a while... see if he brings it up... you could maybe drop suttle hints or leave web page open to his sites and see if he notices and then brings it up... But that is great for you  not being freaked out by it.  It shouldnt matter what sexual preference a person has,  that doesnt change who he is inside.  especially if you have been freinds long enough.. jut support him and be there for him when he finally does need you..and let him know  its ok with you and you are not gonna change your freindship over that one small detail.......
AA10848200	either you stay with him and deal with it .. or run like he ll|`|7eb76dcf8feabcbc7327d1e8926206deaa	be friends with the kids or be friends with someone else simply put....if your not gonna commit you gotta quit......if you string the guy along and the kids start to like you and you walk you'll hurt the kids..be sure before you do anything|`|612b4c60b6d88186afede8251702fae0aa	leave him alone quick and run because you are too young for baby mama drama and you might get hurt in the long run so while you have freedom there is no rush nothing is wrong with just being friends right now until someone comes along who could give you and only you attention that someone who already has children can't give you i been there already trust me!|`|d2b88f1749e9804ea3ec2f06c28e7678aa	Put yourself in his shoes...what if he didn't want to be with you just because you had a kid? If you really love/like him, don't hold the fact that he already has kids against him...but love him for who he is

fd456f8214df9283b5ade5ea69fd44b4aa	i was in the same situation a while ago...i would simply break up with him....if he isn't going to treat you right, find someone else who will....i know it is going to hurt but you have to get over it and in the long term you will be much happier...when i broke up with my guy i was worried about what was going to happen...but it ended up being the best thing i did...i had more freedom to do what i wanted, and i was much happier and i found someone else...hope things work out for you...|`|AA11749282	Why would you want to be with someone that blames you for everything? Not to sound mean but he probably has a new girlfriend and his feeling guilty for cheating on you so he has to make himself feel better by making you feel bad. This way he  See's  how your acting and thinks he did the right thing by breaking up because your acting co-dependent and desperate.And who wants that in a person?|`|2b76e3130ac093abd63d89bf37ae79eeaa	sonds like hes a coward and a little boy placing fault on someone else because hes a lil coward|`|9cec070524f92bda58a3c663be948b0faa	It's obvious that your boyfriend is seeing someone else besides you. People tend to outgrow each other and the excitement is gone it's not any ones fought it's just as we mature we see things differently. Right now it seems like your going thru the motions but the connection isn't there. As for you being a co-dependent that is very unhealthy. He's not that great if he's not treating you with respect. You need to move on and get out of your comfort zone so that you can start the healing process now. Stop being so consumed with your boyfriend. You have to come 1st|`|AA10011490	KICK him in the balls, Punch him in the face, take any objects at your disposal and beat the ****_out of him, then throw him out and tell him you hate him and that you are breaking up with him forever and that he better not speak to you anymore or next time you'll finish him.|`|AA10165605	I'm just coming out of a relationship that is very similar to yours.  GET OUT!!!  The longer you stay, the more co-dependent you will be .  He will continue to belittle you, blame you, etc.  He won't change.  You do not deserve this.  You can make it without him!  Give it a try!  Good luck!|`|ef06a9b5cd81603bac94d49e1eb4a578aa	if he's only ur bf then let him go... dont cry over spilled milk. there's a lot of men out there, involve urself in other activities so that u can easily 4get the pain. you pray also, prayers helps a lot to cope up and move on. good luck girl.
0b57e421fac59656146b9674d3e6dc01aa	Erm. Everybody has different opinion. For me, It depends. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, yeah, life is incomplete without love. And that's when you've fall in love with someone.<br>  <br>  But when you've just broke up with your partner or maybe just been ditched by him/her, and you hate him/her. Yeah, life is not incomplete without love after all.<br>  <br>  So you see, It's different for everyone.|`|AA10525041	Love is just a F*cking feeling!<br>  Don't get dumbed by it!|`|5349e1329b22ee2edd0c2c829f5c0d26aa	hey i really appreciate ur feelings!! & really shocked that a boy is talking like this! but in today's world luv is nothin'|`|6973b3fafbeca635cebb865dbfdada28aa	yes,life is incomplete Whit out love|`|bd286895bc3f48e13f2982b239aa4694aa	Love is AWESOME if there was no love i would die
AA12061444	Whatever you do, be sure to be yourself! Too many people try to be "cool" to impress someone else. She likes you just as you are. Stay true to yourself and don't change your opinions or agree with her on everything just to try to impress her. She will like you better if you are your own person with your own ideas.<br>  <br>  Just ask her for her phone number or internet address so that you can call her or chat with her.

4e9f5175e36c4bff5b69777a17e918d4aa	This is easy, you can't! <br>  <br>  You cannot control how she feels as conviction to her religion as much as you cannot change her feelings on your own religion. My hats off to you for trying but in the end, if you did convert, would you be happy? <br>  <br>  It's my feeling and with experience that I say, you cannot control what and how someone feels or acts, you have no control over that, accept yourself. <br>  <br>  A relationship is about mutual happiness, what is good for one is not always good for the other, I suggest you take a break and make clear that you are not interested in conversion nor are you willing to do such. tell her that you love her but compromising your personal beliefs would not be a happy relationship because there is not mutuality between you both. <br>  <br>  tell her that you'll give her time to think about it and when she's ready tell her to call you. Be prepared for the ultimate, she may not want to be with you, if it is the case, then accept that and move forward. At least you were thoughtful enough to give her the chance, feel no guilt just wish her well and that's all. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|35a454da5980b059deb1efe39756917faa	lol - welcome to life.<br>  <br>  You can convert, or you can find someone on your own religious level.<br>  <br>  Simple and hard to do, but it's the only options. You're not going to make her give up her faith...not going to happen. <br>  <br>  Quite frankly, it's selfish of you to even think she should have to do that. I mean...if you can request she tone it down, then she should be within her right to have you convert. <br>  <br>  PS - you sound young, but this is a very serious issue for peple in relationships. Tons of people get into relationships and marraige thinking they can change the other person...it doesn't happen, and just sets a foundation for fights and disagreements. I mean...what about kids? Whose church do you raise them in? What about holidays?|`|55e2080bb710b67d590f6e8d3c1b33fbaa	Impossible.<br>  When a person REALLY believes in a religion, he/she believes MORE in it than how she could believe in the person she loves.<br>  Besides, you cannot stand against God.<br>  You should accept it.|`|AA11376268	Well...i think I've been there!!! First of all try to make her understand that you are two  individuals and although you are together you are allowed to have different opinions.You shouldn't be the reflexion of each other! It gets boring!But i think you should make her respect your choices and your religion! You should also think that if she can't respect your ideas and your choices...she's NOT the one. Love comes and goes...but you shouldn't give up on YOU, and you shouldn't let anyone change you unless you consider it is necessary!<br>  Good luck! And take good care in what you believe in!|`|b3371a6910a1b013521a0ca5cd7fb068aa	If you love her so much then you will know what to do just talk to her.|`|ddd1764c74ab4a4032ddb7d57d64f5dbaa	jeez she really wants you to change religion and it seems like she's forcing you into mormon. if she loves you enough does it really matter what religion you are. Why can't you just stay a christian? and if being mormon isn't what you want to be then don't be one. my friends are mormon and i think they have a lot of rules too. i remember my friend wanted me to convert everyone i know into christianity but i didn't think that i should and that they should go at their own time and do whatever they want.<br>  You shouldn't force someone into doingsomething they don't want. <br>  <br>   Ask her if she truly loves you and i mean that real love and if she says yes than ask her if it religion matters so much to get in the way of your relationship?<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11914997	Be firm with her.

b882bbf135cc21efe534229b0673079baa	Remember that you are important, and don't let being shy keep you down! Cnfidence is key. It doesn't matter if you had all the looks in the world, if you don't have confidence, then girls want be attracted to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This is a major dilema in many peoplewho are searching for that right one, or in some cases the wrong one. But the key thing to remember, is that no woman is better than any other. When asking a girl, pretend that she doesn't get you nervous, as to psyche yourself. In other words, start by- always be the one to start, if she ever starts, then friend phase has been established, and any chances of dating her has been destroyed- relating your questions to things that are relevant to the situation your in. For instance,<br>  <br>  1. Crack a joke, or make a point about something she is doing, even if it is sappy. As long as she responds back in a smile or laugh, then advance on. But remember, never make a joke unrelevant, and never question. Girls hate men who question them. Just be smooth, and relate. Relation is important; it shows whther you are going to be compatable with her, if that makes sense to you.<br>  <br>  2. Next make a general statement about things she usually does, relating of course to what she is doing at that moment.<br>  <br>  3. Next give her a piece of personal infomation, relating to what you and her are doing at the moment.<br>  <br>  4. Then if she continues to talk, then say that you would like to get to know her more, but don't be eager. Be swave, and relate to situations that and not questionares. Never ask a girl a general statement, only ask related questions with a situation in which you are in.<br>  <br>  Important: NEVER let her know that you want her; never let her know that you want her; never be nervous, and if you are, play it cool; never be clingy; never be obssesive; always be confident; and take the lead. Lead her to date you, but never imply that it's a date. As long as you play hard to get, but at the same time talk to her, then she wont be freaked out. <br>  <br>  IF SHE says no, then you know she's not the one<br>  <br>  but remember that their isn't the "One", so don't get obssesive, be respectful of yourself|`|345ff8fa88e88e25412ba1641071fce5aa	I suggest you go to a public place, maybe a night club. Go around and talk to the ladies. Nothing serious just "hi how are you doing" and if they answer back and smile, talk to them. Have the nerve and talk to her. The only was to stop being shy is by doing what you are shy to do.|`|75144304c9264e72a8e8bfe10b07e3aaaa	I think irrespective of your looks, as long as your confident and not sleezy, then a hi/hello is always welcome. It may not lead necessarily to a number exchange but at least to a nice conversation... It's important to be yourself and be proud of who you are, just think that others would be lucky to have the advantage of gaining your acquaintance, without being too cocky...Good luck|`|7ce858248e6a8844cd1708fe7c0a9129aa	lol too  cute.. just be yourself hun ..If she dont  like you  for u then u  dont need  her anyway !

Being shy is a handicap many men have that will never get you any where sure somtimes we well get turned down by women but how will you know if you had a chance if you dont take it. But dont try smothering women they hate that and will leave you talking to yourself|`|b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	Let's talk man to man.  If you want to get over being shy with women, just relax and go up there and talk to one.  Better yet, practice this by talking to at least 8-10 women per day.  You don't have to be attracted to them, just go up there and talk to one.  Smile and be approachable.  Laugh and make jokes.  Make eye contact.  What is the worse that is going to happen, she don't like you?  Then that would be her loss.<br>  <br>  The more women you speak to, the more at ease you will be around them.|`|a91167324526f69f7742fd5361cdf96daa	Your going to have to open up. Practice at home alone. Just set your mind to it. Plus everyone gets nervous. It's normal. Prepare yourself that she is going to blow you off. So if it ever happens you can say your lost well think it don't say it. The best thing to do is get over it get out there and start meeting women. You can't just wait around forever for a lady to come to you. Which I'm sure one will sooner or later. You got to think positive. No it doesn't bother me when a man comes up to me and says hello.<br>  What you need to do is look around. Make eye contact. If you smile and they smile back then you found one that you should go up too. Chance are 99% after she smiles she's good to chat up. Now that doesn't mean some aren't bitches but they aren't worth 2nd thought you are better then that then move to the next. Get out there and don't be shy! :)|`|5fa20baf9cd0f93c2920041a61bc5519aa	start with a smile, say something natural... don't say anything or approach anyone if it doesn't feel natural, it's better to stay quiet if you find that you are forcing yourself.<br>  <br>  now... there are situations when things just flow... you suddenly find yourself talking with someone as ifyou have known them forever and things just feel right... that's the moment to project all your best qualities; ie if you are funny, smart, nice to be around, etc. just try it when things feel right, if you puch to much brain into the whole situation you may just sabotage yourself but to avoid this don't be a hunter but simply be a sincere human being.... nice women appreciate that more than anything, someone who can listen to them.|`|634c3f80ba7dadb3aa1fb2b86401d586aa	First of all, do you know what you are looking for in a woman? You can't just walk up to any woman. What are you looking for in a woman?  Find out who you want to be with. Who do you want to have conversations with? I know a pretty face or body is important, but her character is much more important. You should look for a woman with vision, intergrity, structure and accountability. You should always carry  the V I S A card =)|`|AA10273788	I guess it depends on the lady.  I like making new friends, I don't like being checked out.  If your first goal is friendship, then most girls will be open to this, but no girl wants to be treated like a piece of meat.  It's alright to be shy, not all people welcome being talked to by people they don't know, but the good news is this.  If you try to talk to someone that you see, and they brush you off, the chances of you seeing them again unless you live near them or work with them, are pretty slim.  Try finding some new people today, both male and female to talk to.  It will help you over come shyness in lots of situations.  :)|`|d00b10dabc9468cf41167a88d638ae41aa	just put yourself in positions where you have to talk and you will get over it after awhile. be yourself.

There is no blood between these two people.  It is not illegal.  She is immature, yes, but in most states old enough to marry without consent.

AA10378559	The bond is set first according to guidelines, normally of the state in which the offense was committed. Sometimes there are factors which would mitigate, or be such as to make less need for such a high bond. In this case attorneys will ask for a bond reduction and a hearing will be held to determine its granting. This is often worked out beforehand by the prosecution and the defense attorneys. However, the judge may not grant a lower bond or may not agree to the lawyers' deal but stipulate another figure. It's unlikely that bond for aggravated assault would be cut significantly unless the judge is particularly lenient, the case is not an extreme one, or the attorneys can offer a good enough reason, such as the character of the individual, lack of previous offenses, etc.|`|AA11000914	depends on the crime and if the person is a threat to anyone.

AA10129172	use your schools social worker or school psychologist Hun they will and should find her help just be her friend and be there for you. I have been through this with many students and the main cause is stress and she finds this way for her to reduse it. good luck and if you need more help please e-mail me at soccer_teach@yahoo.com here is something that may help ya. i know its long but read it<br>  Thank you for caring enough about your friend to seek advice on how to help her get through these hard times. I'll give you my advice, with the disclaimer that I am in no way a "professional" expert, I just happen to know one person's experience (my own) first hand, and have corresponded with other cutters, which may give me some insight on what helps and what doesn't. I will use the feminine pronoun, as girls seem to be more prone to do deliberate self harm, but keep in mind that there are also many male cutters out there, one of whom may be your friend.<br>  <br>  First thing you should know is, there is no quick fix. In most cases the cutter has found on the edge of a knife a coping mechanism that helps get them through life. We cannot simply take that away from them without helping them replace that with something else that really works. They now need to unlearn what they've learned is the only thing that works for them. And this is a long process for most people. So patience will be very important. <br>  <br>  FAMILY<br>  If your friend is still a minor, or living with her parents, how are your friend's parents dealing with the situation? If they don't know about the cutting, then your friend probably wants to maintain whatever level of confidentiality about this that she requests. Be sure to ask HER who it's okay to talk to about this. You can talk to whomever you want to to get advice and help, just don't reveal her identity unless she okays that. Sometimes in a panic, family and friends will institutionalize a young cutter without really investigating whether that institution is right for her, whether they even have a program for cutters (most do not), whether this will impact her in a terrible way. They just panic and their big fear is that she will commit suicide. They understandably fear that because they are not trained to deal with this themselves, they won't handle it right without professional intervention. And sometimes a hospital or center can be helpful, just to be in a safe place where you cannot continue cutting. Sometimes, when a kid is doing this, they're really silently asking for some kind of help, some kind of emergency help. They can't express how they're feeling, they may not even be sure WHAT they're feeling, or why, they just feel something. Talk to your friend about what she thinks would be the most helpful thing that could happen right now to get her through this.<br>  <br>  I believe cutting is usually a coping response to the environmental factors in that cutter's experience. If your friend has been a victim of child abuse or sexual molestation of any kind, and I'm not saying that she HAS, but it is a frequent factor in this kind of bahavior, the perpetrator will have a lot invested in making sure that this fact never comes to light. Therefore if the perp is a family member that will also SKEW things a great deal, in terms of how this is dealt with if the family finds out. So please be very careful with confidentiality issues for her protection. If she wishes to reveal her situation to people then it's probably a good idea for her loved ones to know what's happening, but it should be HER choice.<br>  <br>  HOSPITALS<br>  It's important that the cutter be allowed control over the situation and not be rail-roaded into some hospital ward against her will. Of course, even if she signs in voluntarily, that signature may be coerced, as it was when I was a teenager and threatened with certain punishments if I did not sign the papers at the intake desk of various hospital psych wards. Once inside, you basically lose a lot of personal freedoms and individual rights. People stop believing what you say to them. You're lumped with everyone else as a "crazy" person and you're watched 24 hours a day. Doctors only show up once or twice a week for a 15 minute chat, from which they can learn very little, and then they often proceed to prescribe medication like serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, xanax, prozac, zoloft, lithium, paxel, you name it, they'll try it. While these meds may help some people, usually in the case of a cutter there is absolutely nothing wrong with the cutters brain, no evidence of any kind of bio-chemical cause for the depression, and therefore the chemicals do more harm than good and are an inappropriate form of treatment. Also, even if you sign in voluntarily, it's then very difficult to get back out. They can put you on 72-hour hold if you request to leave the ward, at the end of which you are put "on trial" to determine your condition, and of course there is no "lawyer" on your side, you're alone and everyone thinks you're nuts so why would they believe you when you say you're confident you can do well on the outside? <br>  <br>  When is hospitalization a good thing? When the cutter truly wants to go in. When there are groups inside that meet to discuss this issue with each other, so the cutter gets a broader picture, understands she is not the only one, not isolated. When the doctors don't jump to conclusions and start medication. When there is a professional with experience with deliberate self harm cases who can help the cutter work through their pain and find new ways of coping. When the cutter feels more comfortable in an environment where they know they will not be allowed/able to do self harm. <br>  <br>  CONTACT/THE BUDDY SYSTEM<br>  Okay, what can you do to help? Are you, phoning, emailing, or writing letters back and forth? It's good for her to have someone she can talk to about this. Let her know that she can phone you any time, night or day (night time can be the hardest for cutters) to talk to you instead of cutting, if she wants to do that. (Alcoholics often set up a buddy system and have someone to call so they can talk instead of drinking.) Tell your parents you'd like to pay for the long distance calls and make calls to her in the evenings just to check in and see how she's doing. You could request that she make you a promise, to always call you first (it helps if you have a beeper or cellular phone) when she's feeling like cutting, and hopefully sometimes a long chat with a friend who really cares will alleviate the pain or break through the numbness. If you cannot do it, set her up with a buddy who can be available in this way. Emailing is also good, but having a voice to listen to, even if over the phone, can be better, more of the human touch. You could ask her to write you one short letter a day and send it in the mail, and set up a daily correspondance this way too. This gives her something to look forward to, your letters back, and an outlet for her feelings through writing. <br>  <br>  Let her know you care, even if you don't totally understand what she's going through. (She herself most likely does not yet understand what she's going through or why HER. There may be some sexual or other abuse she's experienced somewhere in her childhood that she is not aware of now - the brain is a genius at hiding what we cannot cope with until we're older and stronger.) Try not to react too strongly to the behaviour itself, even though it may be very upsetting and frightening to you. Focus on HER, not what she's doing. If she feels ready maybe you can explore with her WHY she's doing the cutting. What leads up to it, how can she change her immediate environment so that factors or "triggers" that lead up to cutting can be changed or stopped. For instance, if she always puts on a certain cd before cutting, have her volunteer to lend you that cd for awhile. <br>  <br>  QUESTIONS TO ASK<br>  Does she WANT to stop right now? Is she ready? Perhaps she needs to lean on this cutting crutch a little while longer. Does she think there's any chance that she will actually try to commit suicide one of these times? Or does a certain amount of pain ease her internal pain each time and then it's over for a little while? How deep are the cuts, how much blood does she lose? If it's a dangerous level, then she SHOULD request professional help. If it's not, and the cuts are more superficial, the worst that she'll have are scars, maybe infections. Ask her if there are any ways she can envision for you to provide the kind of friend's help she may need, and ask her to be very specific. Ask her if there are things you should NOT do, things that would break your trust.<br>  <br>  SAFETY ISSUES<br>  Gently remind her that she should be disinfecting her knives regularly, and disinfecting her cut areas before and after she cuts, with Betadine or something like it, so they heal up well. She might want to have some sterile gauze bandages on hand and medical tape. That also lowers the itchiness as they heal. If she's hitting walls, how deep are the bruises? Is there any danger of fracturing bones? If she's setting herself on fire or swallowing batteries, or doing any other life-threatening activities, it's definitely time for her to enter a safe haven, and one should be sought out immediately, be it staying with a friend, checking into a hospital, or finding a center for people who do deliberate self harm. Do some research on help centers in her area and send her the list. <br>  <br>  COPING MECHANISMS<br>  The cutter experiences cutting as a form of self-preservation, ironically. A way of coping with intense feelings. What she needs is to learn new methods of coping that can replace the crutches she's leaning on now; the razor, the matchbook, the brick wall. Once she has these new coping methods she can put away the crutch in her own time, when she's ready. It doesn't always help to show anger, to prevent the self-harm on the physical level, or to punish the behaviour. Perhaps you can suggest to her to find new ways of venting, perhaps working first with physical things, punching bags, working out, martial arts training, throwing rocks in a safe place (into a lake, or in a field or a large empty lot) til exhausted, safe but intense physical experiences. Then work from that to breathing exercises, chakra meditation, writing a journal, doing art work about how she's feeling, etc. Some cutters found it helpful to do art: one kept large peices of paper on which she would draw x's any time she felt like cutting, just drew them and drew them til she felt better, and weaned herself off cutting x's into her arm. <br>  <br>  When the cutter is in denial<br>  Perhaps she doesn't see anything wrong with what she's doing, since it seems to make her feel better, and probably isn't life-threatening. Perhaps she can't face the fact that she's doing it, and denies it even to herself. Or perhaps she denies it to others because she so depends upon this coping mechanism that she doesn't want anyone trying to take it away from her. Perhaps if you let her know that she's okay, she doesn't need to feel ashamed of what she's doing, it's actually quite common, and that you're not judging her, you just care about her and want to help in any way she thinks might be helpful. Try to keep the conversation from getting too heavy, don't pathologize her self-harm behavior. Keep the focus on HER, rather than on the self-harm. You want her to feel safe about sharing something very personal with you that she may be ashamed of. Back off if you feel like you're touching a nerve that will be too painful and cause her to disconnect from you. These things take time, and trust needs to be earned. She needs to know that you'll still be her friend, you'll still be there for her even if she continues to do self-harm. Your friendship is NOT conditional upon her behavior, it's there for her no matter what she does. <br>  <br>  RESEARCH<br>  The more you know about deliberate self-harm, the better you'll be prepared to help your friend. Have you visited the Secret Shame website? It offers a fairly comprehensive collection of information on the subject of self-harm, both from cutters and from people in the medical professions. There's also a list of links to many other sites that also could be useful. Perhaps you could print out information from this or other sites and have that available for her to show doctors and nurses and mental health counselors in case she seeks treatment somewhere, since usually WE cutters have to educate the professionals on this issue. Otherwise they may misdiagnose her. If they want to put her on medications, have her aware that she must DEMAND every kind of test they can run to indicate that the existence of a bio-chemical imbalance before she'll let them give her so much as an aspirin. Or if she's in no condition to stand up for herself, she'll need someone there to ADVOCATE for her with the professionals, and it would help for the advocate to do some research on this subject in order to hold their own in the professional setting. Have a list you've gathered of hospital wards, clinics, centers, help lines, resource books, etc, available to the cutter and to you in the event of an emergency situation. <br>  <br>  Let her know that many thousands of other people do what she's doing, she's not the only one, and that anyone can overcome this, that this won't last forever. You can give her my email address so she can contact me if she wishes to write to someone who's been through it and is now doing fine. <br>  <br>  Thanks for caring about a friend in distress! Good luck to you, and I wish your friend the best!|`|cee76dacd7b746f27f9f5b8239b216c6aa	This is so sad and a sign of something way deeper which needs a REAL doctors help and counseling .. let her know you are there for her, love her and perhaps you can even go with her to find the right help.. do it NOW before it becomes so much worse... and above all else PRAY for her... The parents need to realize this is NOT just a fase... God Bless you as you help your friend..|`|e266cd004e6d54be28252d7a436e3f72aa	My daughter has a friend who cuts.  All you can do is be there for her as a friend, tell her that you care about what happens to her and want her to seek help she is comfortable dealing with, and encourage her to share what it is that may be pushing herself to do it.<br>  <br>  Give her lots of hugs, and reassure her you will always be there for her if times are tough.<br>  <br>  Do not condemn or judge or reprimand for the act... some cut for attention, others cut to defer the pain they are feeling from something else.|`|AA12035958	you should tell her parents or  yours ....seek help for her....and tell her that if she continues to cut herself that you cant be her friend anymore...|`|fa360628718e43712df715f7220de1a8aa	I didn't get past the question to read the whole thing.... TELL SOMEONE!!!|`|fd1e939d363a548de3a461b1dd433972aa	If she isn't listening then tell her that she is hurting you too. My friend used to cut & that's what her friends did. They said that it was hurting them when she hurt herself & she eventually stopped. They didn't say it rudely, but calmly & patiently, & she realized that she wasn't doing anything for herself. If that doesn't work, suggest an alternative, like popping a rubber band while on her wrist, my friend does it & says it works. (plus it doesn't do any damage long term, but that is ONLY IF she doesn't stop w/ the talk!!)|`|AA11323138	that's sounds like it's pretty stressful for you.  if I were you i would tell a teacher again, and also mention that her parents aren't doing anything about it.  have a talk with her and try to convince her to stop.  right now the only one to help her is herself, help her see that?|`|AA11788372	I know it is your best friend....and you want to help her. But this is the best...you really have to tell someone because if you dont know to do how are you going to help. sombody else have to help.....maybe that would work i am a pre counselour...|`|c64740c814eeb52abef0f0a28bef454aaa	Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. This has got to be so tough for you. Kudos on being such a wonderful friend to her. <br>  <br>  At this point, there's really very little more that you can do. I'd talk to the counselor again, and tell them that her parents don't seem to care. Her counselor can call her parents back and try to light a fire under their butts, and if that doesn't work, there are calls they can make. <br>  <br>  As for your friend, she needs to be in treatment. If you keep on alerting people, she'll get it, one way or another. Wonderful job on what you've done.<br>  <br>  One caution: Don't let this drain you. Take a step back when you need to, and make sure that you're being taken care of just as well as you're taking care of her.

If he says that he wants you to be his one and only then maybe you two should move closer together in distance to where you can see each other more often. Otherwise you know what to do to bring happiness to yourself.|`|AA10378447	Sounds like he's stringing you along. He doesn't quite want to let you go, but he doesn't want you wholeheartedly, either.

AA11099554	Ugh. I do NOT miss the drama of homecoming. So many people all hung up on getting dates. A date doesn't make the dance fun.<br>  <br>  Drama, drama, drama. If no guys want to ask you, they're not going to. "Average" girls get asked because they don't walk around like they're the sh*t. They have guy friends that they go with. Most of the time the people who have dates are ones who are willing to go without.|`|caf33a10561042ec579d2d268233ff75aa	nah basicly i cant for certain reasons.... im not gay...or got a asbo but when it comes that ull probably die the next nite of course u wont, but just half a year now and ill be free from torment and can live my life normaly not like a bleedin special forces person keepin to myself and stuff....mainly guys think if u say no the earth will fall in a firey ball, fo me it could end in fiery lead argh life can be tough, i had to train for stealth and u know wot i almost passed but since it was a training mission we had paintballs and i got shot in the azz.painfull then i stood up and bout 15 guys shot at me, lukily i was on a trainin mission so i got pelted with paintballd, but tmoz there will be real bullets and if i do that there is little chance of survival argh now my life is messed up and i aint had one girlfriend,,,,,,ok u dont need to listen to me have a fit about my life enjoy urs and dont worry one guy will have the balls and he could be ur future husband i bless ya with that!|`|ddd1764c74ab4a4032ddb7d57d64f5dbaa	it's not bad going to homecoming by yourself . i went by myself after being asked to the dance..well i went with all of my friends of course, and sometimes it's more fun that way. i mean if you went withy a guy you would have to stay with him a lot of the timeand that's not really fun. <br>  <br>  All guys are different some just go for the sluts(which i think is wrong but hey that'd their choice), the looks, the personality, or another reason. It could be different for every guy and why he wants that girl. <br>  <br>  IF you think rejection is a lame excuse you should try and go ask a guy out to the homecoming then. i think it isn't a bad idea. i also don't think rejection is a bad excuse. Think about it...a guy loves a girl sooo much but he doesn't know if she loves him back and she just might break his heart  if he asks her and has no chance of being with her after she has said no.<br>  <br>  well good luck witrh homecoming!

6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	All partnerships, and all relationships for that matter, go through five predictable stages. Knowing these stages is like having a map that will help you to accurately assess where you are in your partnerships, see where you have been and where you can go. <br>  <br>  This will also allow you to deal effectively with the particular concerns of the stage you are in. For example, upsets, disagreements, miscommunications and misunderstandings are a predictable, inevitable and unavoidable part of the second stage. <br>  <br>  If you don’t know that, you could easily misinterpret what is going on in the relationship, make inappropriate choices and miss important learning and growth opportunities. Each stage requires a different, yet overlapping set of skills. Mastering partnership is about mastering these skills. <br>  <br>  STAGE ONE - ATTRACTION - This stage of relationships is characterized by a fascination with another person, organization or project and a desire to learn more about them, as well as a desire to share yourself. It’s fun and it feels good. This is the time when positive possibilities are sensed and explored. This is the stage people wish would last forever. <br>  <br>  ESSENTIAL SKILLS FOR SUCCESS IN ATTRACTION <br>  1. Be interested, not merely interesting <br>  2. Look for and focus on the best in others <br>  3. Acknowledge/compliment others on the good you see in them and their accomplishments <br>  4. Help people to relax with you - put them at ease <br>  5. Know what the most important things are for people to know about you and weave those things into your conversations so you feel they "get" who you are <br>  6. To simply "be" with others without an agenda <br>  7. Keep your word to build trust <br>  8. Be authentic <br>  9. Look good and smell good! <br>  Speech acts to learn and master: <br>  1. Greeting <br>  2. Making requests <br>  3. Declining requests <br>  4. Making promises <br>  5. Making apologies <br>  6. High performance listening <br>  THINGS TO AVOID <br>  1. Lying <br>  2. Jumping to conclusions <br>  3. Expecting people to read your mind and anticipate your conditions for satisfaction <br>  4. Stereotyping or categorizing <br>  <br>  STAGE TWO - POWER STRUGGLE - This is the stage where people start testing each other. It is one of the most difficult stages for people. Who is going to get whose way and how? Distrust from your unresolved past manifests and there is often a fear of loss of control and heavy judgments of the other person start to show up. Many relationships never move beyond this stage and many end here. This stage is really about building trust. <br>  <br>  ESSENTIAL SKILLS: <br>  1. Know and identify your feelings <br>  2. Speak congruently with your emotions <br>  3. Communicate without blame <br>  4. Self-reflection - observe your thoughts, feelings and behaviors without judgment <br>  5. Own/take responsibility for your mistakes without self-invalidation <br>  6. Observe your automatic interpretations of others and events <br>  7. Be present to someone else’s upset without defense <br>  8. Know and articulate your requirements for trust <br>  9. Be able to restore trust when broken <br>  10. Use current upsets to resolve the past <br>  11. Ask for help <br>  12. Forgive yourself and others <br>  13. Make correction without invalidation <br>  14. Don’t control others or make their choices for them <br>  15. Don’t sacrifice - be generous <br>  16. Practice spiritual attunement to find the highest path <br>  17. Take the initiative - be responsible for your own needs <br>  18. Turn your complaints into requests <br>  19. Be clear-headed and rational while feeling intense feelings or while in the presence of others intense feelings <br>  20. Control your temper <br>  THINGS TO AVOID <br>   1. Giving ultimatums <br>  2. Blaming others <br>  3. Gossiping or participating in gossip <br>  4. Being mean, attacking, hurtful or hypercritical <br>  5. Saying things you’ll regret <br>  <br>  STAGE THREE - COOPERATION - This is the stage where you learn to trust one another and to resolve upsets to your mutual satisfaction and benefit. You learn to share power and appreciate each other’s unique abilities and gifts. However, it is still self oriented, "What can I get out of this relationship?" rather than "What can we create with this relationship?" Beware of false cooperation in which one person acquiesces to the other in order to "keep the peace". This is still Power Struggle, only in a more subtle form. <br>  <br>  ESSENTIAL SKILLS <br>   1.  Know and articulate the essence of your desires <br>  2. Expand your capacity for compassion <br>  3. Read others emotions <br>  4. Assess trustworthiness in others and assume trust rather than suspicion <br>  5. Inspire high level of trust from others <br>  6. Care deeply about others <br>  7. Feel connected with others <br>  8. Generate enthusiasm <br>  9. Find and define a common path <br>  10. Know and articulate how others affect you, e.g., their losing/winning, problems/thriving <br>  11. Make choices for long-term gain - overcome the need for instant gratification <br>  12. Competency with creation techniques, e.g., visualization, goal setting, etc <br>  13. Know and articulate your changing conditions for satisfaction <br>  14. Neutralize competition while inspiring cooperation <br>  15. Ability to articulate higher path, especially during stress <br>  16. Be diplomatic and cordial even when worried, upset and during stress <br>  17. Facilitate conversations for Speculation and possibility, Planning and design, Commitment and action <br>  THINGS TO AVOID <br>  1.Making assumptions <br>  2.Sacrifice - it always leads to resentment <br>  3.Withholding important communication out of fear <br>  <br>  STAGE FOUR – SYNERGY - This is the stage where there is a realization of a power greater than that of each individual. There is also a commitment to a specified focus and use of the power. Extraordinary satisfaction, intimacy, and a deep sense of mutual trust, empowerment and ease characterize this stage. It is a highly creative, high performance relationship. It also possesses a high level of acknowledgment and appreciation. The relationship emanates joy and power in this stage. <br>  ESSENTIAL SKILLS <br>   1. Regenerate creativity <br>  2. Balance work and play <br>  3. Be alert to and neutralize complacency <br>  4. Fine tune and evolve specific talents <br>  5. Dance and surrender during the times of chaos before new beginnings <br>  6. Let go of ego and attachments <br>  7. Be as committed to the larger process you are involved in as you are to your own individual part <br>  8. Practice letting the relationship "breathe" <br>  9. Anticipate temporary Power Struggle when you up level commitment and prepare for it <br>   THINGS TO AVOID <br>  1. Taking the relationship and people for granted <br>  2. Becoming overly intoxicated with the glory of synergy and get out of balance in your life <br>  3.  Expecting synergy to last without nurturing the relationship <br>  <br>  STAGE FIVE – COMPLETION- This is a stage many people fear and avoid dealing with altogether. There are four ways relationships can be completed: drifting apart, expulsion/ejection, conscious completion or death. Sometimes completion is only about changing the form of the relationship, not necessarily the end of the relationship altogether. <br>  ESSENTIAL SKILLS <br>   1. Accept and flow with change <br>  2. Acknowledge and integrate the value and learning from the relationship <br>  3. Spiritual attunement <br>  4. Own up to mistakes without self-inv <br>  5. Make apologies <br>  6. Redefine your common path - change form <br>  7. Articulate the highest spiritual thought about the relationship <br>  8. Know what you need to feel complete <br>  9. Generate a safe space and a conversation to make sure everything that needs to be said or done to feel complete is communicated in a spirit of love and dignity for all parties concerned <br>  10. Allow for a healthy expression of fear, anger, grief or any other emotion <br>  THINGS TO AVOID <br>  1. Feeling victimized. <br>  2. Taking things too personally. <br>  3. Resisting change. <br>  4. Misperceiving that others are the source of your good or happiness.|`|174e046b93f422d7ce7a4bb9488365aaaa	if u have a great sex life and he takes good care of u than the only other thing i can suggest is finding hobbies u both like and can do together. my partner loves golf and although i don't play me and the other girls go along to drive the buggies and have a couple of drinks while we watch the guys it usually turns out a great day. so use yr imagination I'm sure u will find something that u can connect on.|`|8b9ca41c1797ec30cf41973174711538aa	Maybe u both might want to find some activities u both can enjoy and do them together.|`|97620ac6d34afbee0c850b49e96da687aa	i think the very imp thing is good looking, once you dress the way he wants and u look exactly the way he prefers girls to look is the best thing to do, it will catch his eyes and will slowly develop interest in him to keeep looking at you, be with you and will keep thinking about u. imp thing is look good, dress nicely and be well dressed all the time.|`|AA12058726	What made him interested in you in the first place?

Other than food (which is still the way...etc.) there aren't that many ways to get a man interested in you outside of sex. But, bear with me, we'll give it a try. First, you want this interest in you personally, not in the everyday things of your life like housekeeping. Let's try these:<br>  <br>  1. Sometimes it's the simplest things that count. So, drop him a note hinting at something he doesn't know about you or your activities. Be careful not to make him suspicious or jealous. A note is more mysterious than just telling him.<br>  <br>  2. Find something of his and start wearring it around the house. You know, a shirt or something appropriate for you to wear. If he doesn't ask why, tell him then that you just want to be close to him and it was the best alternative you could find.<br>  <br>  3. One thing you don't want to do is cling, physically or emotionally; but this doesn't mean you can't find ways to stroke him verbally, or touch him ever so lightly at times, not in a sexual way, but as loving gestures. Hopefully he'll take note of them and begin returning some attention of his own. It will be hard to make this so that it's not construed as flirting, but that might be alright, anyway. Flirting does not equal sex.<br>  <br>  Realize these ideas are just off the top of my head and I don't guarantee anything. (Standard disclaimer for untried theories) Good luck.
AA11149006	Read up on and practice birth control now, by yourself, don't try and figure it out before the main event is upon you.|`|904fec720de23b1085923b69f39ed40baa	This is not the kind of situation that you study first .

It makes things soooo complicated and weird, and sometimes emotionally painful, not to mention the occasional physically painful.<br>  <br>  However.  If this doesn't sway you, make sure you get condoms.  I like durex.  ABSOLUTLY impress that these must be worn on the proper bodypart, EVERYTIME.  If they won't, neither will you.  Believe me, it circumvents many problems.|`|72f3c61f57233ed9017ec661ea140043aa	Don't wanna be too mean, but I hope the grammar doesn't reflect your brainpower.  In an ideal setting, this is a guy who you could be "friends with benefits" with and hopefully you don't want to entrap him into a full-blown, luvvy-duvvy, I need you too much.  So, keeping it realistic, and especially if you have the mental strength to get birth control for you or make him wear a condom, that's another bonus.  But I know that's a lot easier said than done, so it all comes down to a question of trust and realistic expectations.  It's the best thing in the world to make another happy by sharing yourself, but your unhappiness afterwards is still a high price to pay.

There are many women there who want to find a nice guy who will love them the rest of their lives.  Most would gladly give a nice guy an opportunity to know them if they get the chance.  By the way, you might want to read in the Bible the "Love Chapter" found in I Corinthians 13 where true love that lasts forever is defined.  <br>  <br>  If you only want heartache and disappointment, then go ahead to the bars, etc.  You will find that most of the women there aren't the lifelong marriage types and they will, sooner or later, burn you bad.|`|17c01eda119f8f3da41b99dc537f9d61aa	It can be a meat market.

I've seen people meet in clubs looking for that special someone and it happen but it's as rare as a bleeding moon. There's a reason why they're called a meet market...or in some cases a meat market. The average lifespan of a relationship with a girl i met in a club was one night to two months. I once had one last 4 months.<br>  <br>  All my long term relationships happened via meeting girls in everday settings.<br>  <br>  You will get to know people via clubbing so it can build your circle of friends and increase your chances to meet someone via that circle. Just make sure that when you meet that someone you let them know what it is you're looking for and be sincere.|`|cc436c21dccc58c49c57698def6cb098aa	waste of time, unless you are so busy that you haven't the time to meet people (in which case, take a break).

It is all by chance.  You may get out of your car and meet the woman of your dreams that is on her way to the hardware store that is next to the club.  I think it would be fun and if the right one for you is in the club then if you wanna meet her you better go in there and get her.  Give it a shot and let us know what happens.  Good luck.
AA10883251	He was never a friend to begin with, if he would take sensitive information and use it to destroy you.  Somehow, some way, you must be able to redeem yourself.  It looks like you did not return the "love" he sought from you, and wanted revenge.  That is a classic case of selfishness and self preservation.  To ride roughshod over other people is nowhere near being fair at all.  <br>  <br>  As far as the legal part, if what he said is true, it does not sound like your "friend" can be sued for libel or defamation of character.  I wonder if you can hold him directly responsible for the loss of your job and sue him in civil court for lost wages and mental anguish.  In the meantime, starting your own business, if you have the resources, may be a good way to go.  Seek free legal counseling.  Look up the offices for legal aid in the city you live in, and explain your situation.  If I knew a little more about what happened, I may be able to give more detailed advice.  You can contact me directly at tclifton@comp.state.md.us.|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	What would you expect to get with legal recourse against him? And can you afford to pursue it? If he did so much damage to you, he probably knows the impact because that was probably his intent. I'm sure he understands exactly what he did- hurting you was his goal.<br>  Who knows what your unemployment appeal chances are- gather your evidence and give it a try. It's hard to say without knowing what info he got his hands (eyes) on and used against you. It's hard to know why a man would help you with your job if he wasn't an employee, so it might make you negligent.<br>  Good luck.|`|52c6efd2a28acae483cd9a08949f7789aa	i hoe things work out 4 u|`|490398bdd7bff61f014c852e2ccfbf31aa	A friend wouldn't do that and that is not love.

420d3c55f1d2dd1b4543e0c2fdc8c611aa	I dated a girl like that.  when we went out she was very reserved and quiet.  When we were alone she was funny, wity, and spunky.  We got along great, but it turned out to be nothing more than a sexual interest in me she had.  So, I guess thats a bad example.<br>  <br>  none the less, it depends on the guy really.  if this is your true personality, then an outgoing guy may be the key.  If he is used to being the certain of attention you wont steal his thunder.  When your alone you can be as you are together.  It all boils down to personality and chemistry.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|637ec58c1caf6b6f049c0d381a67e79daa	That's not really hard to get.

d6209efa41042dece31cdf759913ee5faa	ask him out|`|0b635848858188e9ee8e14a3e3f8e5deaa	First of all, the diabetes thing isn't an issue. I'm sure that he doesn't know every medical condition that she has ever had to deal with. If he has had it for a while, it's become a part of his everyday life and it's probably not something that he feels he needs to inform her about...it's just not that big of a deal. He hasn’t betrayed her in any way by not informing her of his condition and therefore it isn’t a reason for them to break up. <br>  <br>  What is a big deal is that you would like to date someone who is already taken and that can only lead to a lot of unnecessary pain. He may be a great guy, but he's not yours and you need to let go. Maybe in the future you two will have something, but right now you cannot do anything. If he was to dump his girl for you, you will always wonder if he will do the same to you! It's just not worth it. <br>  <br>  And, don't chase him. Guys don't respect girls that throw themselves on guys. They want to be "The Man" so-to-speak, so let them come to you. If you respect yourself and are a good person, a great guy will find you. <br>  <br>  So the answer to your question would be to leave him alone. Don't do anything. If you find yourself still thinking about him, get a hobby or do a sport.|`|4e0e6e53672016c4fe28a6a6ae7c7877aa	haha... just be a really good friend to him and sooner or l8r he might relize that he likes u more than her... and yea...|`|90adc70d307e2ea672c98adbedad7186aa	I'd probably take a drink of Acid and calll it a night

But u have to give it ur all, and if things work out you should get pass it and continue to be good friends and maybe over time you might either find someone new or give it another try when ur both ready.
0fc34aa3e78f4e02c2c521c2344979a3aa	Well im a give u the best advice i know, ur still young but having a boifriend is your choice. there's no way to know if a boi likes u or not. sum of them r obvious and others not so much. the onli way to make sure if they like u is to ask, its kind of hard 2 do if u really like him but u have to give it ur all.

And I think thats how I would react to it, in either long term or short term. I guess I would have to sit down and talk to him about it openly and honestly and find out why he does it and what his true feelings are. But I am pretty sure that I would be very weirded out by it.|`|AA10424339	and what wxactly is his reasons? well put it this way, your 6 months into the relationship, up until the time he told you this, was there anything about him that made you feel otherwise? or just the fact you just found out about this fettish of his your having second thoughts? if this info has not gone public, I'd say he opened up to you trusting that you accept him as is

AA11114089	As a paralegal, it really depends on the state you live in.  If you're in Tennessee, just be CAREFUL, but let him take care of it.   You may still end up with half of the Court costs - which around here range from $200 - $600 depending on what paperwork is filed, number of court appearances, etc...   but if there is no joint marital property, no joint marital debt and no children from this marraige, I dont' see why you should pay for an attorney.   However, if there is any of the above, you need to go ahead and do so to protect yourself, your children and your credit.|`|AA10378559	In your case I'd say yes and no. Since you have a bit of a stick to hold over him, his immigrant status, he may not want to jerk you around, but since you have children, it seems to me that some provisions will need to be made for them, visitation, support, etc. and for this you may require legal counsel for their protection. As stated, states vary, but almost all today have provision for doing your own divorce. There are numerous websites with information on a national basis.<br>  <br>  I let my second wife get the divorce  and had no problems. But I walked out leaving an expensive house, and with almost just the shirt on my back. I was that happy to get out. There were no children, there was no settlement, and she claimed fraudulent grounds to rush the divorce through. She paid all costs; I only had to sign the papers. However, this is not your case; so I'd suggest that you at least consult someone for some advice at a minimal cost to you.|`|3aaf203354b8c0677a5cc43405f6a17baa	If you think both of you can come to an ambiable agreement then yes let him pay since he has aready retained . why waste money on another lawyer if you don't have to after all how many lawyers out there are going to want to help the both of you? most of them are in it for them selves and the $$$.|`|3cd648728de4651aa9305222459d05edaa	no divorce with children is considered to be cut and dry.

Before I met my husband, I was in a 2yr. relationship with a guy who wanted to marry me, but I just wasn't ready.  When I broke up with him, even though it hurt, I felt so at peace for knowing I did the right thing.

8fdc583a23a6f65a508088ce4d796f82aa	Alright love, I've been in this situation before. the honest truth is there is nothing you can do to speed up the process of getting over someone you really cared about. The time you two had spent together will forever be in your memory, you would not be the person you are now if you had not spend the time you had with that person. in a way, he has become a part of you. But what you can do, is try to make things work with the one you have now, in time, the pain will ease itself until you think about it once in a while but not all the time, one day, you'll be able to look back upon this with a smile. Talk to your friends about it. It really works, read a book, keep yourself busy until then. I hope that this helps you.|`|1b6f49ed4ecd0530123d255289923697aa	Girl don't go back to him, he was only using you, stick to what you have, sounds like you have a good one now, and your only thinking of him because you chose to remember you are in control of your own emotions|`|afeb5013c542237ed3c84568c10f38bcaa	i know how u feel well..get overit|`|AA11981521	Unfortunately, the best way to get over an old love is to find a new one.

It was horrible - not at all the way I envisioned it ( mainly because I was not married) and it hurt not just during but afterward too - emotionally I felt cheap and sad ( knowing I had disappointed God for what 10 min of whatever). I cried for days it was such a huge mistake.<br>  <br>  Here's the main thing though your adrenaline may be rushing and your hormones raging - but it's not like shoplifiting or falling while attempting a stunt or something like that -THERE'S NO DO OVER - you cannot get your virginity back once it's gone. <br>  <br>  In addition let me point out a few things, if I may, that'll make the decision a little easier to make:<br>  <br>  1) a promise or intent to marry IS NOT the same thing as being married -  not religously or legally - so let that "were meant for each other" BS go<br>  <br>  2)Ask yourself honestly:  Do I want to be attached to this person for the rest of my life ( if you do it will be in all or some of the following ways)<br>  <br>         a. spiritually - he/she will forever be embedded in your brain and will always have a piece of your heart and forever influence how you approach intimate relationships<br>  <br>         b.physically - either by pregnancy or STD<br>  breaking these two downfurther consider these questions<br>              1) do i want a child<br>              2) can I afford a child ( hint: if you're living at home still or make less than 20K/yr the answer is no<br>              3)will this person make a good parent (hint: if they have other children and they don't have a good relationship w/ child and mother - don't even go there)<br>  <br>  and STD's - enough said<br>  <br>         c. emotionally - consider your upbringing regardless of what your body wants is this really what you were raised was acceptable.<br>  <br>  I do apologize that my answer is so long but this is a topic I am very passionate about. I generally say that I wouldn't change a thing about my life - but if i was given the opportunity to go back and change one thing - I would without question take back my virginity and keep it for the man that I'm marrying.|`|7bb3b7e291aefc41d56417f9fb11d690aa	hurt like hell... but it was nice all the same time, he was more experienced than me and was able to make it bearable for me... second time actually hurt worse.... its all good though, i promise if hes gentle it will hurt, but you will love it at the same time.

Your heart pounds when you see him, other than that, what do you feel?  Do you think about him, care for him, see a future with him?  What does love mean to you?  No one here can tell you if it's love because we each have our own perception of it, there is no standard or generalization.  It sounds like you have sincere feelings towards him, but only you will know what love is.|`|cbf8b1ee8a3a861fdd4592ff575b427aaa	yes....|`|ea299139b13dd070cf077635bd7da94daa	love or lust, hard to say without more details.|`|03a3a3da1f8f6b45aba52b3b52d987a9aa	It is possible...also possible you are heavily crushing. I mean love is deeper than "oh my god he is so gorgeous he makes my heart pound". If his voice soothes you... If you find peace in his presence, if you and he have the ability to enjoy each others conversations, if you feel at ease with him...etc. THAT is indicative of love. Lust is good but it is not what love is ALL about. Lust plus love...now there is a winning combo. Good Luck...if it is love, I hope he loves you back!|`|AA10046787	yes you are BIG TIME like druling over him!!! so what you have to do is try talking to him and ask him out or just start talking to him for 5 minnuts and he will crack and ask you out. unless he's taken utherwise  go for it!!|`|da2fb142b1ce7cd9e636d1c5e289b204aa	well i think u r but it might be lust u might have to do other things 2 find out if u r like get a kiss or go on a date or somethin like that to find out if u realy love him or no like if u get a kiss and u just want to colaps cuz of it than i would say ur in love so go get that kiss :P
ba8dee1305bc0991890ac711fd10f4e9aa	Stress is really negative for the mind and the body.  Being angry and irritated are signs of stress...reactions.  Try to observe what you are doing when you are angry or irritated. Then release the need to be angry or irritated.  Use your mind to tell your body to relax.  Have an image in your mind that is calming,...like being in a warm serene forest or at a beach.  It is important to use whatever image you have that will enable you to easily come to when you need it.  Hold the image in your mind as you begin to notice your breathing and really take note of slowing your breathing down but breath deeply and exhale slowly.  You can do this sitting in a chair, laying down, or standing around.  Usually you will notice that you are feeling much more relaxed in a minute.  If you are really stressed out you may need to take time out to use the above technique but you may also need to drink some water, (no ice) as just the simple act of hydrating your body can be of great value.  By allowing your body and your mind to relax you will be able to clearly think.  Drinking the water will not only hydrate your body but assist in getting rid of toxins that get built up during long periods of stress.  Peace of mind and heart to you!|`|126a12353e14f4a4871a94b49726d9a9aa	I play video games.

Think of it like this: your child will see that you are taking care of her/him even though you do not live with your child and that will count in the years to come and she or he won't blame you for not providing for them (keep receits if neccessary) - if the money goes straight to your wife, then find some other way and by opening a trust fund for them if you do not want your ex-wife to have the money directly herself, but this will cause some arguments if she doesn't agree.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, as long as you are contributing is the important thing and that your conscience will be clear for it and this is what both parents are to do when they bring a child into the world, they are both responsible for taking care of it's needs no matter which one earns the most.<br>  <br>  I can see your point however, and I think the courts should only make you pay what you can reaslistically afford until you can get a better paid income.  Taking money from you that you do not have isn't exactley fair on you either and so they should be able to work something out with you until your own situation improves.<br>  <br>  Getting a good paid job isn't easy whether you are a man or a woman and not all of us are buisness orientated, so this I can really empathise with you and there are a lot of people in the same position as you. But doing some training and getting your own skills upgraded will boost your confidence and make you feel more in control of your finances and situation.<br>  <br>  For those who haven't gone through what you are, are not going to understand your situation and it must be hard on you. But work towards ways in which you can improve your job prospects and towards getting back on track again will help.  Your child will one day understand that money never came from trees and although your ex-wife may have enough to keep her child alive for years ahead, doesn't mean that you can't either and in fact, by doing your bit for your child shows great comitmment to them and to which they will thank you for in time to come.|`|6a837ae9c1fed73d9a78152ddfe4b038aa	Sorry , but its not always the man that gets it......<br>  Divorce is hard on everyone.

fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	My husband's mother is a horrible person. Before we got married, she would scream at him, his brother and his sister. They would not say anything because they didn't want to make it worse for them or their father. So I kept my mouth shut until we got married. After the wedding it started back up and I spoke up. She no longer treats my husband badly and is a little nicer to her other children. She, of course, is civil to me and starts no trouble with me. My husband thinks that she is scared of me because noone has ever stood up to her before. I say go for it girl. There is no reason for a family member to treat his family like that.|`|AA12382198	If his dad is ruining his life he's letting him.<br>  <br>  This has been going on longer than you've known him...either he learns to speak up or this will be his life forever.<br>  <br>  However this is not your fight...your fiance has to get his own backbone not yours.|`|a1dd820fb4f7a967392d966f07fe8893aa	Would it really do any good for you to say anything to his dad?  If the guy already is nuts yelling at everything, what do you think he would do if you butted in and said anything?  You want him to get violent?  Do you have a death wish?<br>  <br>  Stay out of it.  The guy probably should go to a doctor for a check up to see what is causing it, but until he gets treatment, you should "stay out of Dodge" and not get involved.  You will only make it worse.
79df02f6727268ac3d9c091da9bffbb1aa	No not really, u girls act weird... one minute you act all nice and show interest and when a guy does approach you, you girls give the cold shoulder! orrr sometimes we just think does she really like me or what? so thats why we tend to not make a move cause wre not sure, or scared of rejection!
AA11223605	girl, distance....when u see him resist all urges to go up and talk to him, leave him alone...that's going to help alot...do things that u enjoy to get ur mind off him, as vivca foxx said in "two can play that game" "occupy your damn time." girl time is what it takes to get over anyone okay? trust on that. and you will get over him eventually. i would let him go if he's immature wishy-washy like that...one week he cares about u and the next he doesnt want a girlfriend? time, space, having fun in your own life will help u get over him...it'll happen sooner the less u think about it...Good luck.|`|4471835df796c0f7d42e446cafdb7765aa	You are not alone in this world going through the same thing. me too my ex told me that she won't be dating for the next 2 years. guess wat she went back on her words.

Guys rarely leave their girlfriend unless they are pretty sure there is someone else to take their place. If he is talking about other women in front of you it is OVER as far as he is concerned and he's not even interested in keeping you handy for ex-sex. I know it's tough when you are going through a break-up but trust me when I tell you, like all women you will eventually look back on this and wonder what you ever saw in him. I had six serious long term relationships throughout my 20s and 30s and I don't think of any of them as the "one that got away". In fact on the rare occassion that they cross my mind I feel slightly embarassed that I was ever with them!|`|c6aa8578e942702c51c1ae02f44f0ee5aa	it seems like he's not ready for a serious relationship and you are so just stop thinking about him and start thinking about stuff that are worthy to think about fine someone you are able to love a little and just hope that that love will get bigger|`|07629c3ccf7b80297a00fa5ea7c6ad8eaa	To get over some one, you got to get with some one else!!!|`|4286419b80146becc7eefc807e1c93f3aa	It sounds like love to me. True love is the kind you can't shake. And he probably thinks of you as "just a friend" So, the only way to end it, is to try again.

I don't like 'em and they sometimes piss me off. I try to ignor them and one day they are going to come back and bite her in the a**. Only advice I can give you is to ignor them, I know how hard it is. I want to comment everytime, but I also want to keep the peace. My husband knows they bother me and he doesn't like them either. He also doesn't like me to be upset, so she is really shooting her ownself in the foot. Just sit back and wait till they have to eat their words.

Of course it's going to hurt.<br>  <br>  Anytime you spend several years with another person you are bound to miss them, it wasn't all bad.<br>  <br>  Some relationships are just not "meant to be" and you may not feel better tomorrow or next week, but you will feel better with a little time.<br>  <br>  Try to keep busy, go out with your friends.

A person your height should weigh between 95 and 128 pounds with a body mass index between 19 and 24.<br>  As of now you need to gain weight as you underweight and that is unhealthy.

AA10508426	It sounds like you are being taken advantage of.  Sleeping with someone is one of the most intimate things you can do with another person, and in my opinion, should be taken very seriously.  In other words, you should not feel bad for stressing about it.

If you have any question in your mind, it is probably better to say no, or at least wait until you are sure.|`|2160e514ae105dc3bdb8de81517290a2aa	Not the sex part, but if you ever read some of the questions here posted by some of these chicken boys, you would know that they share the same insecure stupidity that many girls have.<br>  <br>  Do they like me?

c8812420fdcb2cc8403e3ff668fd2e44aa	I don't blame your boyfriend for being a little scared there, but telling you what to do and who to hang out with, isn't good. Its your choice, not his. Reassure him more. If you and this boy just hang out alone I too would fear you were cheating. But if you hang out with this boy in a group of people than its fine.|`|0105993629432247b6bf6781a4a0680caa	No it's not cheating. As long as there is no sexual stuff going on.|`|01c767252ba8bfd3d5905ee58079dd86aa	No, it's not considered cheating. Your boyfriend shouldn't be able to say whether you can be friends with someone or not. It's your own choice. But I understand why he's afraid of losing you . . .|`|d3c07e6a3ca7a93f8106d7a54406bbd2aa	No, but it's kind of like being a traitor.|`|1feb48299b8bc5a0ce062433a3ab3116aa	This is how it is going to play out.  Some day you will argue with your boyfriend.  You will feel angry toward him and your friend will use the moment to move closer to you.  I am telling you that is how guys move with girls.  They move very sly.  I am a guy.  And I had a first hand experience with that kida situation.  If you still want to keep him as a friend, you must ask him to make a promise to your boyfriend that he won't do anything to break your guys apart.  That will make your boyfriend feel comfortible.  Remember you love your boyfriend, not your friend.  My girlfriend chose her friend over me.  One day I found out they were sleeping together in my own house.  I let them hang out all the time together and that is what happened....|`|4796c1aefa26d4e48ba6727de4788729aa	you have to choose between him and your boyfriend.  Guys do not become friends with girls just because. He is your friend because he wants to be there for you when your boyfriend messes up, so he can be your boyfriend; especially since he hit on you to begin with.  His feelings have not changed unless he became gay.|`|6e483c39a53902ea752e8c3fdfcb9ca9aa	Its not cheating...but it is making your boyfriend upset because he knows how guys play games.A guy will like you and "be your friend" while your in a relationship because they know when something goes wrong THEY can be your shoulder to lean on......they want to bring your spirits up when your boyfriend brings you down.......guys are just as sneaky as girls when they want to be....so your boyfriend doesn't want him to be your friend because your "friend" has other intentions.....|`|AA11310275	no it isnt cheating......ur boyfriend is over-jelous.......i have seen this alot in my life......sit down and ask ur b/f y he doesnt want u to hang out w/ the guy......if he doesnt give u a straight answer or makes an excuse like "because i said so" or  "y do u need a reason" etc etc.........then tell him that u will not stop being friends w/ this dude......if he gives u a good reason then try to come up w/ a comprimise.........and if u 2 r in a relationship then u should have no prob telling him what u 2 r doin together.....prove to him that he is over-reacting.....and if that doesnt work.....then ur b/f has problems he has to work out on his own|`|AA12021324	I would say your question is a double edged sword.  What it comes down to is respect and trust, and whether you want to open a can of worms that might explode all over the place.  You know your boyfriend wouldnt appreciate it, so do you respect his feelings and not continue the friendshship?  As far as trust goes, its not a question of his trust for you, but the fact that he feels he can't trust the other man simply because he does not know him.  And knowing that this guy liked you at one point doesnt help the situation.  So is it cheating?  That's a question that only you can answer.  Noone else on yahoo knows your relationship the way you do.|`|b52329d0a442cb0813ad491745021b35aa	Tell your boyfriend to grow up.  All my closest friends are guys and my boyfriend knows this.  He also knows that guys are a dime a dozen and true friends are hard to come by.  My friends are first at all cost.  If that is a problem, he can hit the road.  There are plenty more where he crawled out of!  Now, the question is:  Is this guy a true friend?  You take it from there.  If he is , then your boyfriend needs to start acting a little more mature!|`|ba6ad51aa56b9f49d6cf02e9329d628baa	As a grown mature woman I have found that we cross paths with many, but few become friends. If he is a friend you want to continue having a friendship with and can see that you two will be long time friends, boot the boyfriend, they come and go, friendship is hard to find, and keep.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck|`|f993fbb4754f65032244dd6d963849d8aa	no way, you can be friends with whoever you want|`|AA11610394	no but I wouldnt do it|`|5c9dab7742e64475a5ccf7dd3dc968c8aa	not  cheating at all.

In a relationship, if you love someone so much you tend to understand him for how he is, what he does, who he is.. its like reading a book, your not in the end yet, but you know or expect what is gonna happen.. but to answer your question, Yes! connection of 2 people can be strong.. it is like an intuitive instinct between a man and a woman.|`|9EMNTV9kaa	sometimes you know a person so well that you can predict what's happening in his life..from his behaviour, his way of talking and viewing/doing things...you may know what the person is thinking or what he is doing...

Raro o anormal no lo creo, supongo que en Espa?a son mas liberales que en Mexico y aqui abundan los casos de esos, aunque si es tu caso, te sugiero que pienses en que siempre hay edad para todo, y aunque te consideres "madura" para tu edad, la madurez fisica o mental no la puedes medir en ti misma|`|b49ba20d9a9064c529399171e58cf866aa	yo ando con mi novio tiene 24 y yo 16. si los dos se aman podran ganar todos los obstaculos. sobre relaciones sexuales creo que es un tema entre los dos. no hagas nada  que no quieras si el en verdad te quiere te esperara y respectara tus decisiones. mi novio me respecta y sabe mis metas con el. hable comunicanse mucho que eso les ayudara mucho. suerte!|`|0ff3d3d0369c7ae8d3be6b57af789dbeaa	Rara ò anormal no; pero si quizás un poco inestable y peligrosa, porque ambos pueden ser algo inmaduros en cosas de sexo, y el hombre por mas que tenga dos cabezas le sirven de poco a la hora de una estar con una chica.|`|cfcf11047329b3ba23a493df28c6f956aa	depende de las leyes en espa?a, si no, no hay problema supongo|`|11a52fa0ac8f51ebd47a7bcac8e0b69faa	Pues sí, creo que podrían tenerlos y serios, la verdad.<br>  Una menor es una menor, da igual lo madura que sea para su edad, pienso que, si verdaderamente fuera madura se daría cuenta de que el sexo no se puede excluir de una relación.

It'd be a shame if you gave up on a good thing, or atleast what you once thought was a good thing, simply because you're in a rut that may or may not actually have anything to do with the relationship between you and your husband.  And even if it was just the two of you and not the weight of the world coming down on you instead, it's sad to think you'd just up and leave without trying to work it out.

De ahí en fuera  todo de lo que nos preciemos ser due?os solo es temporal.<br>  <br>  Esto significa que somos los únicos responsables de todo lo que hacemos y dejamos de hacer.<br>  <br>  Una persona responsable toma decisiones conscientemente y acepta las consecuencias de sus actos, dispuesto a rendir cuenta de ellos. La responsabilidad es la virtud o disposición habitual de asumir las consecuencias de las propias decisiones, respondiendo de ellas ante alguien. Responsabilidad es la capacidad de dar respuesta de los propios actos. <br>  <br>  Para que pueda darse alguna responsabilidad son necesarios dos requisitos: <br>  Libertad.- Para que exista responsabilidad, las acciones han de ser realizadas libremente. En este sentido, ni los animales, ni los locos, ni los ni?os peque?os son responsables de sus actos pues carecen de uso de razón (y el uso de razón es imprescindible para la libertad). <br>  Ley.- Debe existir una norma desde la que se puedan juzgar los hechos realizados. La responsabilidad implica rendir cuenta de los propios actos ante alguien que ha regulado un comportamiento.<br>  <br>  El ser huamno responde de sus actos ante quien es capaz de dictarle normas, y esto sólo pueden hacerlo Dios (responsabilidad moral), uno mismo (juicio de conciencia) y otros hombres. <br>  Cuando disminuye la responsabilidad, lo que disminuye es la libertad, es decir, lo que entorpece la voluntad y el entendimiento, que son las facultades necesarias para realizar acciones libres. Por ejemplo, la violencia, la ignorancia y el miedo. <br>  Es preferible ser hombres libres, due?os de sus actos, capaces de tomar decisiones y de asumir sus consecuencias. <br>  <br>  Para evitar responsabilidades ante los demás, es frecuente echar las culpas a otro, o bien decir "soy libre y hago lo que me da la gana"; queriendo expresar que no rindo cuentas de mi comportamiento ante nadie. (Obviamente la libertad humana no es así). <br>  Para quitarse responsabilidad ante la propia conciencia, un recurso habitual es evitar reflexionar: aturdir la cabeza hasta que no pueda pensar. Otro sistema es decir "yo paso de todo", o "ningún asunto me importa". (Pero la conciencia intenta protestar ante esta dejadez). <br>  Y las excusas para evitar responsabilidades ante Dios son abundantes. Desde decir que no existe, hasta afirmar que Dios es tan bueno que todo le parecerá bien. (Pero la verdadera bondad desea el bien verdadero).<br>  <br>  El camino más rápido para mejorar en responsabilidad es apreciar claramente que de nuestro comportamiento dependen cosas grandes. Los hombres con ideales y metas elevadas se responsabilizan enseguida de sus decisiones. <br>  Hay varias virtudes que se relacionan mutuamente con la responsabilidad. <br>  Valentía.- Para dar cuenta de los propios actos hace falta un valor capaz de superar el temor al castigo. (Responsabilidad ante los demás). <br>  Humildad.- El orgullo dificulta pedir perdón; mientras que la persona humilde reconoce sus fallos. (Responsabilidad ante uno mismo). <br>  Piedad basada en la filiación divina.- Quien aprecia el gran don de ser hijo de Dios procura que su comportamiento agrade a su Padre. (Responsabilidad ante Dios).<br>  <br>  Con la edad suelen tomarse decisiones más importantes, y normalmente la responsabilidad aumenta. Pero no mejora por el simple paso de los a?os, sino por los hábitos que se adquieren o sea se está madurando, y para la madurez no hay una edad específica, pero si mínima.|`|08ff4615e8d3ef3649130149cd86afe1aa	Si de nuestra mente, por que nadie sabe lo que pensamos.|`|G3kdUCVwaa	SOMOS DUE%OS DE NUESTRO DESTINO SOLO TU SABES QUE HACER CON EL.TE DESTRUYES O TE SUPERAS CADA DIA.|`|RGArgaI1aa	solamente de nuestro propio destino porque dicen que lo que siembres cosecharas|`|xvrI5tChaa	Somos due?os de muchas cosas, la vida es nuestra en fin, esta en nosotros tomar lo que debemos y lo que nos merecemos como derecho.<br>  <br>  Somos due?os de respirar, de suspirar.<br>  De creer, de so?ar que se puede estar mejor.<br>  De nuestro amor, de mirar con cari?o.<br>  De insistir, de persistir cuando las cosas no salen bien.<br>  Due?os de nuestro silencio y de nuestras palabras.<br>  De nuestro deseo y sue?o, del despertar.<br>  De enojarse, de contentarse, de la duda.<br>  De las decisiones, de las indecisiones.<br>  De escuchar y de ignorar, de oír las melodías.<br>  De disentir, de asentir, de renegar y de calmarse luego.<br>  Somos due?os de todo lo que esté a nuestro alcance y más.<br>  Somos due?os del olvido y del recuerdo.<br>  Due?os materiales y de los sentimientos.<br>  Del “Libre albedrío”, de profesar nuestra creencia.<br>  No de la verdad pero si de decirla.<br>  Del corazón, del alma y el cuerpo, del espíritu que queremos.<br>  De llorar, de reír, de explayarse y de las frases leves.<br>  De la pasión, de la Templanza.<br>  De elegir que es lo queremos para nuestras vidas.<br>  Y de vivir lo que elegimos sin culpa.<br>  De vivir.<br>  De eso y una interminable lista que nos dice: “Que somos due?os aun sin tener algún título que lo certifique”.|`|y7CZQ78Yaa	Si somos due?os de la libertad de poder tomar nuestras propias decisiones... de apreciar lo que nos guste y recharzar lo que no...
esrw1wrLaa	Para mi arrepentirse de algo, más que una aceptación es una gran dosis de mostrar madurez, ya que el arrepentirse significa el autocompromiso de hoy en adelante de pensar antes de actuar.<br>  Arrepentirse no cambia nada, pero es un buen comienzo, ya que evadir los problemas o ignorarlos solo nos provoca carga extra en nuestro interior, que no nos deja espacio para experiencias nuevas.<br>  Entonces, claro que me he arrepentido de algo, quien no?, solo las personas a las que todo les resulta, o que nunca han cometido desaciertos o no se han atrevido a más que los demás, esas personas tienen poco margen de equivocarse y de afectar a otras; pero como vamos a tener experiencia y a ser mejores si no somos audaces, y aprovechamos nuestra condición humana, como el reconocer para mejorar es decir el saberse arrepentir.|`|d011268ebfe9398a46bb6e4d9903880daa	De tantas cosas que no entran en una respuesta como ésta.<br>  Quisiera tener la máquina del tiempo de Volver al Futuro, así me veo a mí más joven y me digo que tengo que corregir, así no me arrepiento.<br>  <br>  Salu2 MOPAL de Argentina.|`|951022abca26f8ea8c54fb8e822b06e1aa	no, de nada|`|13UT0I08aa	De no haber dicho lo justo y necesario en cada ocasión de disgusto...|`|290776c1972acc2f58b1c8260c338071aa	si de haberme comido un pedazo de pay de queso bien rico.|`|462e6d51c98e52db013924ee4ddc013aaa	hastael momento no si he tenido algun error me han servido por k de ellos aprendo|`|ngsReDOjaa	si , me arrepiento de haberme, separado de mi primera esposa, creo , despues de incontables relaciones con otras mujeres, creo que a esta (mi ex) no le di mas aguante , de eso me arrepiento lo juro.|`|58b8192a50b47dc85e8786b90d7c192daa	no es ke me arrepienta solo que a veces me remuerde la consiencia|`|BfA7t760aa	Sip, creo que todos cometemos errores, y aunque muy pocas veces con dolor nos hemos arrepentido de algo, como "chin, mejor me hubiera comprado la pelicula de harry potter en lugar de la vida es bella para verla con mi novia", o cosas asi de simples, y en cuanto desiciones grandes en mi vida tambien me eh arrepentido de algunas de ellas.<br>  <br>  salu2|`|TVud4Mzsaa	En este momento de no haber hecho un contrato de alquiler.<br>  Saludos.|`|VcOY1wlZaa	jamas<br>  <br>  <a href="http://primocampeon.spaces.live.com/" rel="nofollow">http://primocampeon.spaces.live.com/</a>

Myself I think you should stay home with your mother, she needs you right now.   Your father,and the police will find him. the police are already looking for your uncle, and will put him back in jail where he belongs. I'm sure your brother will be alright.  I'm really sorry that has happened.|`|36113eb888725ae8fd41f91e1c5faa46aa	that sucks<br>  <br>  i don't think theres much you can do apart from give the police as much info as you can on your uncle|`|7af77133827f73a83233662bc181a950aa	You should be there for your mom.

Your parents don't need the additional worry of wondering where you are.  Maybe your brother heard your uncle got out and went to hide somewhere.  All you can do is pray.  If you think you have any pertinent information, by all means give it to the police.  Good luck to you and your family.|`|18dc2c19d10a1881fe0c0fa6ae6405a2aa	Your presence at home is more important. your dad is out looking and the police are experts at finding people. if you have any info that might help, let them know, but otherwise your mother is going to need you. It's terrible losing anyone let alone a sibling, but losing a child is infinantly worse...She will need you especislly since your dad isn't there to comfort her. Stay home, you'll be a bigger help there.

f89972d488a380975a8008bbadacc784aa	I would rather do a fun activity than eat in a restaurant. For example, play miniature golf, go parasailing, ride a roller coaster, something like that. When you share experiences -- especially ones with an element of fear, like parasailing and roller coasters -- you make a deeper connection and are less stiff and nervous. You can get to know each other better more quickly.<br>  <br>  If you want to eat afterward, probably somewhere a little nicer than usual. But it's probably better to cut the date short and leave her wanting more!|`|a2ccd8bef95fb5887de73dee210c7b89aa	Chuck N Cheese.|`|a42764a3f5f04399d9e8122b039893cbaa	laid back and relaxed.i would be more comfortable just hanging out and relaxing|`|bbd55faea8f4d9f823f86c1d92fa325caa	fancy and upscale|`|59dd0d0f851dd49189f8dcfb0ec58b68aa	for the first date, more laid back.

z43O9sHkaa	He's telling you right now "I don't love you".  Accept that and quit pressuring him to lie for you.  If he really loved you, he'd tell you that.|`|AA10551026	Honey, does it make you feel good when I tell you I love you....<br>  ... Yes<br>  I would like that feeling every now and then too.|`|246681fa9a7feaf35e7bbbdd84fa46d4aa	First of all, only he can tell you he loves you. You believing he loves you doesn't make it anymore real than a figment of your imagination. He may like you a whole bunch, but you projecting love is a relationship no no. It is pretentious, rude, and condecending to tell him that you know how he feels by his actions even though he isn't expressing it.<br>  <br>  If you want to know how he feels, talk to the boy. Chances are, he knows the weight of all those words like love and doesn't throw it around like a circus whore like most people do today of the younger generations. Just shut up and let him talk. Accept what he says as his emotions and move forward in the relationship.<br>  <br>  Or...<br>  <br>  If you want love and he isn't giving it, dump him. If he isn't ready for what you have to offer, then he isn't what you are looking for. Trust me, when a man loves a woman, he shouts it off every mountain top. The fact that he isn't should be a clear sign that he is not, I repeat, not in love with you.|`|7f03236c2f77dc0dc8982d752c085e82aa	my b/f (5 years together) has told me he loves me maybe 15 times all together, but everyday, he shows me he loves me just by the little things he does.<br>  <br>  Like right now im sick, he cooked last night, cleaned up, put the kids to bed (they are not his kids) and took very good care of me.  Did he say "i love you" no but more so than that, I felt it.<br>  <br>  Yes we all like to hear the words and I do tell him otherwise I would have never hear it 15 times.  I simply tell him<br>  <br>  "honey, I love you and I know you love me, will you tell me you love me"  I leave it at that and within a day or so he will tell me.<br>  <br>  He won't tell me right after I ask him cause he don't think it means anything that way.<br>  <br>  I don't ask him to tell me often cause well, I respect that he thinks they are just words and don't mean a whole lot if you say it all the time.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	You need to tell him straight out that you want to hear it - if you are honest in your relationship you need to be forward about it.  But be prepared - some people don't open up well verbally and it might not happen.  Or else, he doesn't really feel it and hasn't been able to tell you yet.  If it's important to you, then you need to take  the risk.|`|d10dd1007f7a547bab7ad20f1a4490c1aa	ask him if he loves you. simply say " do you love me". if he says yes.... then well he's the guy.....if he says no......well you know what to do.|`|d1d9c591381f6009e917718d1f238f6eaa	Ask him if he loves you.|`|AA11204886	OK, let me get this straight. You want a guy to open up about his feelings. A guy. Um. yeah.

Ply him with some Southern Comfort.|`|AA11612498	just ask him.... your not pushing or pressuring him you need to know when your alone together just ask him.........good luck|`|rKmG8SJSaa	sometimes you just have to be straight forward and just ask him if he loves you.

Does she have qualities other than physical ones that attract you? Beauty should not only be skin deep, but should be in and of the person's soul, as well. It seems to me you get bored with these beautiful women not because they are uniformly beautiful, but because you are being shallow by finding your attraction to them only in their beauty. The most beautiful lover I ever had was equally beautiful in her personality, in her graciousness and in her charity or ability to give in return. Look for these qualities and you might be satisfied at last.|`|ULnmLYqraa	Well, you obviously have no imagination.  And - you want to be "done to" rather than be the "doer"....

Que cuando salgas de la oficina los problemas se queden ahí hasta que regreses.<br>  <br>  Me dio otras lecciones sobre eso. Las internalice y hasta hoy he podido resolver muchos problemas de trabajo y personales con solo dejar que el tiempo se encargue de ellos. Ciertamente atiende los que estén a tu alcance atender y deja que los que no puedes resolver el tiempo se encargue de ellos. No hay que desaparecer ni desesperarse.

No estés así!! :'( yo sólo tngo 17 a?os y, a veces, me pasa lo mismo que a ti, incluso de levantarme x las ma?anas y... eso... desaparecer. La verdad es que no encuentras razón por la que seguir viviendo y te cuesta mucho sonreír. Yo, encima, caí en la anorexia y casi... bueno, casi me muero. Actualmente estoy en 1o de bach y me va fatal, por notas y por todo, porque no tengo ganas de seguir estudiando y me veo sóla y en el más mísero paro. Básicamente eso es perder la ilusión a los 17 a?os. Pero he encontrado una nueva distracción, de hecho, la encontré aquí, en las respuestas de yahoo!! yo se lo que es pasarlo mal de verdad y ver cualquier objeto cortante como un paso a la felicidad (ya me entiendes) y por eso, lo que más quiero en la vida, es ayudar a personas que estén como yo. La verdad tampoco se me da tan mal... dar consejos, guardar secretos y ayudar es lo mejor. Además, me he dado cuenta de que, al mirarme al espejo, soy mucho más guapa sonriente. A veces me levanto y paso del mundo, pero el mundo no tiene la culpa. Ponte metas: ma?ana empieza a solucionar UNO de tus problemas, dentro de dos días empieza por otro. Dentro de poco todos terminarán. Busca un hobby (el mío es escribir y bailar), lee libros y ayuda a otras personas, viaja... Ahora yo estoy de buen humor y es muy fácil decir esto pero... te aseguro que merece la pena... Ponte música a tope y baila y siéntete guapa. Muchos besos cari?o. Jamás pienses en algo así vale?? te aseguro que la vida no sería lo mismo si tu no estuvieses aquí.

A demás tú eres muy importante para Dios, porque sos hechura a su imagen y Dios lo que quiere en este momento que te ves abrumada, es que cambies de estilo de vida. Jesus dijo:"..yo soy el camino y la vida" te invito a que confies en El. El es el único amigo fiel en este mundo lleno de  tanta inestabilidad e insertidumbre.

What I will offer as advice is this:  If she's this fickle now, and she's looking elsewhere for relationship potential, then she's not that into you, and I think you need to find someone who will be.  My advice is to tell her how you feel (and it seems you have) and then back off.  You can't force her to do anything she doesn't want to do, and unfortunately if you keep pushing, you might end up pushing her away.  Give her time to think it over, and if she chooses the other guy (who honestly probably won't treat her as well as you would) she'll eventually try to come back to you.  However, by this time I expect you'll be engrossed in an amazing girl!|`|bc2d55ee2ecf2976fa1ef4fb122746acaa	Give up that is her way of politley saying she's not interested. you can do better than her n e wayz.

e500fb764ca7bc7459c0aa15c4140bbeaa	how to start this . first an abuser will have control over you . he will use mental abuse to keep you  there .  verbal threat's . convince you  that  no one wants you  .  or  he might  treat you  great  when you are in  public and like trash  at home . make others think you are madly in love with him . laugh and joke and be loving  when others are around . and  just the oppisite when no one is  around . <br>   the abuser  gets the  thrill of  haveing you confused and afraid of him.. slavery  went out a very long time ago.<br>  <br>   ther is lots  of sign;s.  you  have to use  caushion  in  the relationship. don't let him  convince you  that you  don't have to work . that  you  can depend on him totaly , he might  try to keep you  from having your own  job. no job / no money to leave on.<br>   and if you  have a car . keep it in your  name ONLY >  with ot it  you have no way  of  getting anywhere. your  best bet is  get out while the getting is good and you haven't ended p in the hospital yeet .|`|ad8274965813e984a240e893d0b56291aa	Its hard to leave because you are comfortable to a very unconfortable situation.....<br>  <br>  Donno about the abuser....|`|71f92238db1fec58835f3c5ac292a511aa	Usually misguided love (or so the abused believes) or being brain washed, ie, nobody else will ever want you, you can't live without me, etc. A really good abuser can convience everyone that they are good to their mate and they can do whatever they want, like go to the movies, shopping, lunch with friends. But then the abused will at the last minute say somethings come up and can't go.<br>  <br>  they get control and that's what they want.<br>  <br>  abusers usually manage to keep (or get) their partners away from family and friends. They will tell them what and when to do things, what to wear, things like that.<br>  abused people usually start to shy away from loved ones, worry about not pleasing or doing what the abuser wants. The abuser will come before any and everyone, even their children in some situations.|`|5642a23dcb1585365e557f6b8cfebe14aa	My oppinion on this is that abuse is a control thing for the abuser. I have also noticed that people who are being abused and dont want to leave stick around because they are scared or they think the person will oneday get better in the name of love. Signs of abuse - the person that is normally confident becomes timid or jumpy, bruising on body, gets scared if someting is said infront of the abuser that they know the abuser wont like. Abusers are bullies and like to be incontrol, even when their own lives arent.  My advice is if the abuse is a continual thing then get as far away as possible for them and confide in someone you feel safe with and has given you good advice in the past and listen to them.|`|66952a3502c85af839af028b03039a4daa	well in my case it was fear!   i was totally alone because he got me away from my family and friends.  i was so totally dependent on him, didn't know where to turn, and thought the only way to escape was through death. i tried and thank god he had a different answer for me.   the abuser usually gets power out of abusing someone, it makes them feel Superior, it gives them total control. due to the fact they need to abuse others to feel good themselves, and is usually those who have low self esteem who will abuse.<br>  also those who have been abused will sometimes abuse themselves.  a sign that someone is being abused is fear to talk and express themselves, a flinch when someone moves too quickly or the look of fear in that persons eyes.<br>  a sign of abuse is bruises, always lying to cover up that they have been hit.<br>  there are different forms of abuse 1. physical<br>                                                         2. emotional<br>                                                         3> financial<br>                                                         4    verbal<br>  someone who is called names or yelled at continually is being abused.<br>  most of the time women don't leave because they are afraid of being found and being beat worse for doing it|`|eab435b1e13069169249dd413679408eaa	The fear of retaliation makes it hard to leave the relationship.The abuser is usually very possessive/controlling/jealous and easily angered>They lack empathy.They are usually very insecure within themselves>They use intimidation/manipulation/physical violence/verbal abuse/threats to control their victim.To keep them in line so to speak.The abused usually becomes with drawn.Becomes isolated from family/friends/Has excessive accidents/makes excuses for the accidents/refuses to seek medical treatment/refuses to report abuse/makes up excuse for the abuser's behavior/hides bruises/becomes feared for their life/feels that no one can protect them from this person.The abuser plays off their fear.I do not know.What the abuser gets from it?except total control of the person/the relationship.|`|aa98463e67c5242afef42aa25c236b15aa	so what are you asking?|`|d2646bea9f8735ed26935186d4d3a04caa	There are several factors as to why women, inparticular, don't leave abusive relationships.<br>  <br>  1.

Pero pienso que la violencia en todas sus diferentes formas contra cualquier ser humano es intolerable.

g8PyakXYaa	I think the bigest problem is that your are wanting to talk to "cute people" and not wanting to be with people to be their friend. when i was like 14 guys used to say i was cute all the time and It wasn't as nice as you may think. in the end I married the guy who was my best friend and loved me even when i had not so cute days. <br>  <br>  Okay, But I'm sure that you know that you should be friends first- but you said you are shy. Allot of girls are shy too, it's evry normal. I always had big cruses on the shy guys. I took it as a complament when a cuy couldn't look me in the eye or would blush and stammer. <br>  But If a guy left his phone number with me, I would feel yucky. It maked the guy look like he doesn't care about me enough to speak to me. I know how you feel (oh boy do I ever!) but the best thing to do is just to be nice girls you know. and if you do meet a girl you think is cute you can just be truthful. <br>  "Hi, Im _____ and I was standing over there and I know this is sort of silly but i though you were very cute." <br>  i know it's hard, but who cares if it goes bad? time goes by quickly and people forget things fast. just do what you have to do to get over you shyness.|`|PTCwF0Bdaa	That's gonna look like you're about 13 years old. If you're not 13, you need to go over, introduce yourself and attempt to get her number. <br>  <br>  This is relatively easy to do. Just be honest and charming. Tell her you noticed her from across the way, thought she was cute and wondered what her situation is. Regardless of her answer -- since women sometimes claim to have boyfriends that really don't exist -- attempt to get her number. She'll likely give you some number or other. Of course,  you won't find out if it's her real number until you attempt to call.  Giving out a fake number is a woman's way around telling you no while you're standing there.

09461e3632ddec2acfa1fae14fde50c8aa	Wear your cape if you want to...you're not hurting anyone. It is a little odd and you're aware of this. Maybe in some situations where it's rather inappropriate you could take the cape off and drape it over your arm and just carry it with you.|`|AA12007347	A cape? A c-a-p-e? Like superman wears, like batman wears?<br>  In the old days, people wore capes to look bigger than their enemies. Capes are also worn to signify social status. <br>  <br>  Now, really. If others worry about you wearing a cape, then they have a problem!!<br>  <br>  I am 54 and I wear the same outfit every day. it took me years to put together what I liked. It is my "signature," my "trademark." Your cape is your trademark. Wear it proudly.<br>  <br>  Look at Johnny Depp. He dresses for HIM, no one else. Now others are dressing like him. One day people will dress like you and me.|`|AA11848993	wow - you sound cool !!!  I would make out with you while you are wearing it!|`|0206215382f57b459331e7e1714c4cd9aa	I think that you have a issue with your body and you are hiding behind this cape.    Get your family to fast and pray with you about how you are feeling.  That's all the help that you need.  Maybe you can talk to the pastor too.<br>  <br>  Try to minimize it for now.  Like only wear it in the house.|`|191bb1756bf7988e620e25a0ad0e54f7aa	i think i have the same thing going on with my slippers.... i put them on first thing in the morning...i would wear them to church if they let me.. and i put them on out of the shower too...

Definitely.|`|af4f96a63afb1d63fbbe5661157839f8aa	You have the right to wear whatever you want, but it sounds like it is interfering with your life and relationships. Do you really think it's worth it? I mean would you rather wear your cape, or spend time with friends and family without them being embarrassed? I don't think you need help, you just need to find out what is more important to you.

YOU MAY LOSE HER IF YOU DON'T SHOW INTEREST.    HER ANGER IS PROBABLY OVER NOW, I'D CALL AND TRY TO EXPLAIN TO HER HOW YOU FEEL.

Your a hard worker, your dedicated to your job, your making money and she's not happy with this???!!!  Doesn't she know how lucky she is to have a man like you? She's not worth your time.  Do not call her in 30 days, do not call her in 7 days, do not call her ever.  In time, you will meet someone who respects, appreciates and supports your work ethics.  Good luck and I hope my honesty hasn't offended you.|`|a646e7ac786c875e28daaf917edb5ebcaa	If she was The One, you would find the time to make her important or at the very least, find ways to SHOW her that she was important.  Ending a relationship is very difficult but you might want to face the facts that she is right.  You didn't show her that she was important enough and now it's over.  Have you ever seen the movie Family Man with Teah Leone and Nicholas Cage?  <br>  <br>  Actions speak louder than words and if your actions have been showing her that your job is all that's important, than this relationship shouldn't be mended.  If you think I'm wrong and she is THE ONE, don't apologize anymore, do something drastic to show her how wrong you've been and what you're going to do differently from here on out.<br>  <br>  Either way, good luck!!|`|c3aca45d7cab738f33cc881861fe180daa	no bug her for a month tell her how much u miss her and if nothing then ur gonna have to forget about her|`|d9558537580b7dc6f310938b31b484ccaa	You do not need to wait 30 days.  If the problem was the fact you did not have time for her you need to go talk to her and make time for her. Not wait and see how long it takes for another man to hit on her.

That is just plain rude. Are you not man enough to tell her that you dont want to date her anymore? You shouldnt be dating if you cant even break up with a girl. If you want to break up with her then just tell her to her face.|`|38d00d912e518ec3c9f8c68793e20ea8aa	you sound like an as*hole!

You can't get him another job, when it comes to employment you have to sell yourself, nobody can do it for you again unless your Daddy owns his own business and he gives him a job as a favor. Your BF just needs to be a man and admit his mistake to his boss and tell him it won't happen again. And then he needs to follow through with his word. I was a boss for a long time and I would never fire anyone over one mistake. If they fire him I'm sure he's made other mistakes and this one just pushed them over the edge. And stop asking your BF to jeopardize his job just to spend the day running around with you.

Believe it or not, sometimes that doesnt make us feel any good. To me, it just sounds like your looking at a poster, when in fact Im a human with feelings that would rather be callled cute, pretty or beautiful =)|`|AA11089116	beauty is in the eye of the beholder tell him to stfu|`|2ba4f4e34a0857e9e8d0fa04a955a7c2aa	a girl is hot if you  think she is...for her mind and body...pay no mind to what your friends say because it is you who matters most and your opinion|`|9c7e7f27b6452c597616b68cdd7f05f8aa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If you think a girl is hot, she's hot cos it's your own opinion. What is beautiful to you may not be beautiful to others just like you see in the beauty pageant contest. Overall, it is you that will spend time with the girl and not your friends.

Women no longer need chaperones to go out on the date with them.  Couples live together before getting married.  You know, so on and so on.  For this reason, I don't think that men necessarily need to be the one that takes the first step.  If you want to go on the date with the guy, ask him!  If you're not the courageous type, pump up the flirting.  Casually suggest to go to the movies.  (:  goodluck|`|tlxe23Cjaa	Sometimes but not always....|`|AA12042981	Yes but not always.|`|2f4495ab4a2da8ec813d6bff12ac6a76aa	Sociological studies say, yes, since relationships have a better chance of working out if the man initiates them.  Most of the time, I'd say, the man should be the asker.  I hope this "retro" fact doesn't disappoint you.  Let me go on to say that a woman can encourage a man by smiling at him, always being interested in what he has to say, being warm and responsive.  Both people play a part!  From my experiences with friends who've used match.com, I find that if the woman intitiates the contact even on internet dating sites, the relationship often does not bloom.  It seems we can't fight our hard-wiring!  But don't let that discourage you.  Remember, "he chased her till she caught him."!

That is all you can do. Talk to her and casually let her know. But dont let her catch on that you want her to be nice to her boyfriendm|`|afab6b496cc4cf44dee95f839b81ef1daa	You just tell her...<br>  I know it was wrong for him to do the things he did to you awhile back but he made the effort to change and you took him back. Now, you're going behind his back by kissing another guy after he changed for you. Doing this doesnt make anything right, and this doesnt fix anything. If you were gonna hurt him from the beginning you shouldnt have taken him back if you really didnt care about his feelings. So I think you should chose, you either keep seeing this guy you're kissing WITHOUT that boyfriend you have or you stop what you're doing and TREAT your boyfriend RIGHT.<br>  Something like that, however you feel or wanna say about it obviously do it. I was just helping you out and giving you an idea.

That's ridiculous. What kind of girls are you dating babe?

It was easier to be  foul-mouthed and disrespectful than to understand the problem. Her deal is she's an immature brat. Are you hoping that you'll be "the one" to understand her, love her and heal her? You won't be.  If that's your idea, then you have some "rescuer" issues to deal with.|`|aa679c6ce84a2ca860911237a432449aaa	Dear Joe-<br>  <br>  It seems to me you like this girl, but because of her behavior in general it is gotten you to think about what you should do, Let me see if I can help. First off you can't exacatly get inside a girls head, If you want to find the root to her problem then I suppose the logical thing to do is to talk to her, like have a conversation with her and get her to tell you what is is going on with her and find out the reasons why she is acting out and it seems like she is very disrespectful to her parents when there is or is not company around, it also seems to me that she has no respect for herself, if she is flaunting around in front of her parents.<br>  <br>  If you can't get her to communicate with you in a private conversation then you only choice might have to be to find some that does not confuse you that way you won't have a hard time trying to figure out what is up with her. You need a girl first of all that has respect for herself and has a little respect for her parents. Whatever this obsession is with this girl apparently that is all she can think about. Like I said they only way you be able to figure out what is going with her and what she is about is to have a conversation with her , maybe a private might much better and she may open to you without the crowd around. This way you can get the answers to your questions and maybe she can get answers to whatever questions she has. Hope this helps Joe.<br>  <br>  Good Luck , I hope she finally crack and you guys can start a proper relationship.|`|821ff8778bb0ea8df2b5904d20d85f13aa	maybe she is just going through a faze...most girls do in the early 20's. just sit down and try to talk to her if she won't open up then there is really not much else you can do.|`|acd4fc425342f5b41ed136b2f538a4b3aa	I think that it's her way of rebeling.. I mean you did say that she use to get bullied in school. She's just hiding her true emotions.

Yeah but she probably regrets what shes doing but she just wants to prove her point that shes done taking all this stuff. So shes making other people feel bad. You should probably just sit down and talk to her and tell her that in heart you know shes a good person and that you like the old her not saying you dont like her now but you know shes better then this. just a sugestion.

AA12127693	I would have to say / ask...how comfortable is the other parent with keeping the child over night?  Is the child breast fed?  Does the child have adequate sleeping quarters at the other house?  These are all things to consider when talking about visitation.  I would say definitely during the day for a couple of hours at least twice a week if overnights are not feasible and maybe some weekend time also.|`|f8e5d692c81d0cbf764838835a7f6e53aa	I really don't think there needs to be a set standard.  Cause you truly don't knoe how tha parents are to be setting standards.  If the parent is unruly and does drugs and mistreats the child it should maybe be 30 miuntes on a day that the other parent isn't to busy and it should be supervised, once a week if that.<br>  <br>  If both parents are good parents, then I think that visitation with the child should be set equally among the parents. At one year of age the child forgets easily and should at least get to see the other parent every other day at least.<br>  <br>  I am sorry that you are going through this it is hard.  I am divorced and know the feeling.  I can't say I know the mans side of it but it can't be any worse than what it feels like when I have to let him go and stay with his dad for the summer, especially knowing that he doesn't want to go.  <br>  I know my ex doesn't get to see my son as much as I do but if I didn't have my son I would call as much as possible my ex doesn't even call once a week.

AA11605431	So.. he doesn't try any new positions, you don't like the pre-c*m, he prematurely ejaculates, and you don't get off and cry?  <br>  <br>  The way I see it, you have three choices..<br>  1) Dump him and find a more experienced and satisfying lover.<br>  2) When he's done, diddle yourself to the big O.<br>  3) Take control / help him.  Slow him down some.  It's not all 'wham bam'.  <br>  If you have to, then roll him over and you get on top.  Take it slow and just kind of sway your hips front to back and back and forth.  Every once in a while, go up and down.  Then just stop.  Sit there and watch each other.  Reach around behind you and GENTLY fondle his sac.  Take his hands and place them on your breasts and tell him to rub softly.  When he's close to reaching his, then stop all movement and make him wait.  Go slow and - get this - try making love.  <br>  <br>  Tell him he can bang you next time, and when he gets off too quick then again, roll him over.  This lets you find what REALLY feels good, and may help you get one before he falls out.  If he does, then you may still be able to grind on it until you find that spot..|`|04fcfa2181cbce8a53a029bea99fc0e4aa	If he is finishing before you I would suggest that you get some creams that make him numb/ less sensative to your good stuff. then that should help your situation.

AA11681145	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  When I first stared dating my exhusband, we would go to his family's house and he'd always want me to cook.  I don't know about anyone else but I was raised where you don't just go into people's kitchens and start cooking.  I couldn't do it.  He would get really angry and upset.  His family use to look at me crazy because I didn't want to cook, I told them that it's nothing against them, this is the way that I was raised and I don't feel comfortable.  They still talked about me but I just let it go.  I told him if he wanted me to cook for him everynight, he should get us our own apartment.  I told his family if they think I should cook for him everynight because I'm the woman, he should make me his wife so I can do all that domestic stuff and be his HOUSE WIFE, until then, we're just dating and I'm not his mother so he can cook his own damn food!!!!|`|58cfe37b4574d1d515795f2be1508a49aa	well they have their exeptations and you have your attitude if you like to make them happy you can help a bit in this matter but if you dont want then make an exucuse for that.|`|942e6759424c3244b0c28fbe5e9441b0aa	Well, You shouldn't have to cook in their house thats kinda weird in a way. If he cooks let him cook, ingore the parents and just do what you want to do|`|AA10938125	Wipe that scowl off your face and cook for him!  Go spend an hour in the kitchen looking around to see where everything is.<br>  <br>  I dont believe just because you are a woman you should cook but dont make excuses about doing it either i thought cooking was a way of showing someone you loved them.  I really dont know hey maybe things are different here in australia??|`|59a183431a99984a11d07015d549b867aa	This is really a catch 22 'The woman cooking is part of the Hispanic culture, if you want to be with this dude you are never going to get away from that.. know matter what you say .. or he says to his parents on your behalf doesn't matter because is this culture the woman cooks and cleans and the Guys bring home the beacon... Hispanic men are very hard workers most of the time.. and you  need to be at home hookin of the Comida when the evening comes.. Anyway, it would be alot easier for you if you were not living up in his peoples house.. I know you are probably walkin on egg shells and feeling all self- concious everytime he goes in the kitchen to cook, and his mom or somebody is watchin ... that is a wack to be worried about that all the time.. He is coo with doing the cooking so you guys to figure out the fastest way to get the hell up out of there and into you own $hiT, because nothing is changing otherwise|`|882839f1fbf05b0f7e72ca605f76eb68aa	Can't honestly say I have but try helping him in the kitchen. Invest in a cook book and surprise him and his family one night with a home-made cassarole. Don't let the "why should I" be your excuse. Ask him where things are in the kitchen or offer to work together on dinner. Remember, you want his family to like you, it makes things easier (think Romeo and Juliet) Be polite. Have fun with it, make holiday foods for them, like bake them a pie one night but don't reveal it until AFTER the dinner you helped him make. then surprise them with a nice pie. that could help.|`|AA11745183	well my family is filipino & they sometimes feel that women are supposed 2 the household chores as well! i get annoyed by this bcuz that was soooo 500 yrs ago. tell him  (and his family) the exact same thing u just told us here. good luck|`|d85dad8a9438734912240470880c6827aa	I don't have to have had the problem , in order to answer your question.Ask yourself how does this make you feel when someone is making fun of you?  The answer is:  Not good, recognize you are surrounded by inconsiderate and non helpfull humans. You are either a part of the problem or you are part of the solution,there is no getting around it, you are one of the other.I am not speaking about you, I am speaking about them.. Now make the decision, what do you want, to be surrounded by uplifting, encourging and loving humans or not. it's your choice, choose wisely, for this is your life we are talking about.|`|f60efd860933a3e91bcd4099071441a9aa	I know it is important to keep good relations with his family, but when you come down to it your relationship with your boyfriend is the most important.  Ask your boyfriend when you cook for him, is he happy with the meal?  Is it eaten?  If not then I would take advantage of the Mexican cooks in his house and learn some new recipes.  It can only add to your cooking experience.  Let them know how you feel and you may be surprised at what they are not thinking and only teasing him.|`|17bba31defb7b1bc925729452d27c386aa	no I think you are just using this as an excuse not to cook any one can learn, why do you not ask some one in his family to teach you Problem solved|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	It won't take you more than 10 minutes to find the pans. Just do it and do your best. People appreciate the loving effort even if the results aren't fantastic. Don't embarrass your boyfriend by being a "typical American" wife who have reputations for never cooking, cleaning or  raising her kids.  If you make the effort, I'm sure they'll be willing to teach you. Meanwhile, you can get recipes and cookbooks and pick things that sound tasty.

Dont get in the situation of the two of you getting close.  If you have doubts about being with someone end it before you have the opportunity to wreck a relationship with someone that you could have ended things good with if you didnt want to be with him.

5f66db13330c426ef8cefca5ed35f53aaa	oh yes, he was most definitely asking you out! it sounds to me that he just didn't know what to do in front of other people, he didn't want to make an idiot of himself if you said no, so he didn't take that chance of formally asking you out, but girl he most definitely asked you out, just in his own shy way, maybe you should get things happening now, because he's probably too embarassed to ask again. =)|`|6421d3ec83da29271c07d7e5c9027164aa	take it from a guy also...yes he is trying to do it in a creative way...maybe he is too shy to ask out directly,so that is what we do...

Don't be so hard on yourself.  <br>  Secondly, being forward and just talking to this boy will do alot for you...even if you are rejected.  Being rejected teaches you about yourself, and builds character.  Take the experience, learn from it, and move forward.  Plus, you never know, he may like you too!

I met my husband when we were 16. We knew or thought we knew we loved eachother at that age. Plus you think you know everything at that age. ha! ha! ha! You really may be feeling love, those feeling can't be helped and it's hard for you to see the future, but your going to have those same feelings for so many people over the next 10-20 years. Also make sure that the person you may be in love with has your best interest at heart. I always hated when grown ups told me that "you don't love them, you don't know what love is..." those feelings are real and sometimes we just need help expressing them. It;s also a good idea to keep a writing journal.|`|616d395137697bcf57c7b45dd3eab7fbaa	Yes...i had...but it was an mistake...<br>  If you are single or going throught a break up and you are looking and need someone, please visit my site, join free and start dating:<br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ykj7bm" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/ykj7bm</a>|`|7d8828b794f72028f1e314a2de8465f1aa	yes i have felt like i was in LOVE and he said he loved me as well. i don't know if you will take my adviceto heart, but don't do anything with them until you are absolutely sure that you are really in love not just infactuation. if it is the real thing then take it for all its worth you never know how long it will last.<br>  P.S. find out if they love you to before anythign happends.

Next time he walks by, just say, "Hi, how ya doin'?"  tell him that you seen him walking by a few times now and just thought you'd be friendly and say hi.  and then just go right into  talking  to him about movies you've seen lately and how you liked them and  ask him if he liked them.  If he hasn't seen them, ask him to see them with you.  There you go.  You'll be nervous as hell the whole time, we all are when we do this, that's half the fun so just do it. Good luck.|`|AA12285636	probobly just likes your body|`|b74aa28a3e094ba70ed830f6f59c185eaa	i think he likes you, or he (no offense) thinks you are not very attractive....hideous.|`|b05592f190ed9775182b087578a5625eaa	It means he thinks your a fine peice of meat.|`|db74748ef7b64a01c35750599322986baa	He might think you're hot or he likes you.|`|e89bfed4138d7dd60231ab556e862a12aa	maybe he thinks you farted.

What?|`|17796069ac9db13e8face6f2e53ad8e2aa	first and foremost get out of that relationship NOW! it's a no win situation for you and a win win for him.  He has the best of both worlds in his mind and you got nothing but your weekly check and that could go south in a hurry and unemployment could be your source of income..He is not leaving his wife/family for you..Stop and think if you did it with him who else are you going to do it with...in him mind. and  VICE-VERSA.. .Seems like a trust issue will always be lacking and will, well into the future..Find your own man and get a life of your own. settle down and live happily ever after..Sorry this has happened to you and I sure hope you get out of it soon..(and this is from a guy ) Good Luck to you :)|`|AA10733221	As long as you're professional at work, and he doesn't harass you, then don't worry.  If he fires you, then you can sue for sexual harrassment.  Decide whether or not you want to continue the relationship, then stick with your decision.|`|68578d253daa44b2e739d71826e9dd2baa	Never get sexually involved with work mates it never works out especially if they are married. what do you need to be scared of? what's really going on and why. Just because he is your boss does not give him any power over you and if he uses his work position to create stress in your life then that just emphasises that it was not a good idea to have sex in the first place. you need to really think about the consequences to all the choices you make before doing things in life. Be honest with your feelings and thoughts and listen to any gut instincts you may have and live a healthy honest lifestyle without stress if possible. good luck with maintaining a professional relationship in the work place.|`|c090b4c41e6c7a3b6343a6484b41f570aa	Blackmail him for a raise or promotion.........<br>  YYEEEEAAHHHH GO extortion|`|ce19b2d44bbee0df4ee858a2e949007eaa	Why are you afraid?  You've got all the cards on this one.  First off I have to say sleeping with someone married and works with you was dumb. Sleeping with your boss was DUMBER but you can still come out of this ok.<br>  <br>  First things first.  He won't leave her for you. He's married. You are divorced had a need and broke down and gave it up to your boss.  It was a mistake you need to realize that. Nothing good can come of it.  Just tell him that him being married it's just not a good idea.  And you'd rather put that behind you and just keep the relationship professional going forward because if anyone found out there could be dire consequences.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry if I were you.  He's got everything to lose.  And if he decides to be a jerk then it's harrassment and as he's slept with you if you took it to Human Resources he could lose his job and his wife would find out that he'd been harrassing you because you refused to sleep with him.  If you've got an tangible evidence like something in an email or note.  forward it to another account and save it.  That way if he has a friend in the I.T. department and he calls in a favor to make any evidence in email disappear you still have a copy somewhere else not on a company server.<br>  <br>  You could also use it to your advantage when it comes promotion time.  But that might not be good for karma.  Keep it someplace so if he get's out of line he'll know who's in charge.<br>  <br>  So what you need to do is:<br>  Break up with him.<br>  DON'T do it again.<br>  Avoid him but keep the work relationship professional.<br>  Find someone to sleep with who doesn't work at the same company.|`|96d047f29e4ce6461bf934006343f882aa	you are in deep ssssssshhhhhhhhhh....|`|c839158f48a255a5f7647ead10f0be46aa	STOP IT NOW !!!<br>  What are you doing is wrong in all terms, in all religions, traditions and costumes, in any society ....<br>  It doesn't matter if things are professional or not at the work, the matter is that he is a married man and maybe he has a children.<br>  Don't believe if he tells you that his marriage is bad, and that he will divorce his wife, all of them say this but just a few leave their wives.<br>  Try to put yourself in his wife shoes and see what will you feel if your husband has an affair.<br>  When you realize this is wrong you will leave him, even if you love him.<br>  Believe when I tell you that there is at least one not married man that waits for you, who will be just yours and you will not have to share him with anybody.<br>  Good Luck.
8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	An engagement is a serious step in planning a future together. It seems he asked you to marry him as insurance to keep you tied to him while you go to college, without understanding the implications. I think you should give back the ring and wait until you finish school before making life-long commitments to a person. Especially if you won't see him.|`|62cf128e0ad1aacd996b86c19da9816eaa	You said Yes.  If you are planning on marring him after college you will work out the details on seeing eachother.  You will have holiday's and phone calls.  You have to trust love and if you don't you might want to tell him you can not marry him....|`|5c96dfbf7eefc9c0f3043df8e043a32baa	My husband actually proposed to me while i was away at college and while he was in the army.  If you love eachother that much nothing will get in the way.  Be engaged, wait till your done with school for the wedding, besides it takes a lot of time and money to plan a wedding.  Theres nothing wrong with being in college and engaged.  Good Luck and Congrats on the engagement!|`|6973b3fafbeca635cebb865dbfdada28aa	Run!<br>  marry him.things will be adjest if you both love eachother|`|AA10329680	well if he really loves you then he would not want you to get married so soon, he would want you to finish college.  IF your love is for real, then it will still be there after college.|`|bb18b6b62d2474ea9abc8d3607464643aa	Listen.  You're not married yet.  You're just engaged.  I mean, I'm glad you're taking the engagement seriously, 'cause it probably means you'll take marriage seriously later on.  I'm just saying that if something goes south during the engagement, then at least it's not as bad as if you'd already gotten married.<br>  <br>  Why wouldn't you get to see him in college?  You're going away and he's staying here or going away somewhere else?  How long is that going to be?  Honestly, my first thought is that he proposed to you because he doesn't want to lose you while you're gone.  And while that's very sweet, there's still room in both your lives for some fundamental differences to creep in over the next few years.  Especially if you go to college and he doesn't.<br>  <br>  Anyway.  So you're engaged right now, and you're going away to college.  Tell him that you want the wedding as a graduation present.  Long engagements aren't unheard of, especially in a situation like this, and again, if something fundamentally changes and things go south, at least it was during the engagement.|`|8ace3fb8c85866d45df2bffda52d5ca5aa	If I were you I wouldn't have said yes ...especially if it might put your education in danger.
a12fe10f4b0e85d27634981652c8c3c5aa	yes he probably like you very much or else hed stop being like that after finding out about your bf. i think you are falling for him or else you wouldnt doubt yourself. all i can say is that if you are having feelings for this person, maybe its time to reconsider your current relationship with your bf. if you really like or love him, you wouldnt think of the other guy. good luck.|`|7a9b6d8140c9da5fc3123470ec9cbf09aa	No i dont think it is crazy.

AA11069788	First of all maybe find new friends because there is nothing wrong with going to the cemetery and putting flowers on someones grave on their birthday when you loved them.  If they can't understand that they are not your friends.  With the eating disorder and rape see a counselor or therapist because they are trained to help you with that.  With your self confidence you have to learn to love yourself first.   Hope that helps, Good Luck|`|90adc70d307e2ea672c98adbedad7186aa	What you need to do is move and just get away.<br>  If u live there your just gonna be stressed out all your life and worrien what will happen next.|`|195db5b5de8ffe2e4656dcbefda989ebaa	you should move foward because there is nothing you can do about your ex or when you got raped.  get over it.  its all in your head.|`|82ce2cadaa619bb860b4e5870e36d073aa	look for someone who can help you darling|`|8703115ab4762d9e929c1913471d9eddaa	there is nothing wrong with going to your friends grave!! thats payinf respect and if they cant understand that then they need to grow up.  i am sorry about all those terrible things that happened when you were younger.  :hugs:|`|b1da803624aa7c1865b132e1299def15aa	Hey,<br>  Firstly, so sorry for all of the bad happenings in your life, but things will turn around for the better. I know, because it happened to me. <br>  Like you, I was abused sexually by family members too, only from when I was three years old...I also ended up with eating disorders and became ill through it...But I overcame that, and I'm so glad that I did. I also lost my boyfriend through a horrible accident, and although we weren't engaged like you were , I visit his grave every week at least. If your friends cant understand why you do this, then they aren't very good friends to have. It's not a really bad thing youa ren't with your ex at the moment though, because you have enough to deal with already. Please speak to someone, a councellor maybe, who can help you through your bad times, and eventually you'll become much stronger. Remember though, the person you can get the most help from is yourself...Try your best to move on from the bad things. You can't change what's happened in the past, but you can control what happens from here on..<br>  <br>  I hope things get much better for you.|`|115ca79bf66f24c02dea39935505f6e4aa	First of all, you do not need anyone (especially a guy) to help you get through the rough parts of your life.  I understand it helps knowing someone cares enough to listen and offer advice but you also need to consider that the only person you can truely trust and depend on is you and GOD.  Thats it.  <br>  I'm really sorry to hear that so many have taken advantage of you in the past and that it is very tramatic.  I think you should consider getting some counceling so that you can find closure to these horrible things.<br>  As for the A*holes who say you dont deserve anything else because you still hold on to your love your ur X fiance... They are stupid.  They are NO ONE to judge you.  You can take as long as you need to greive and mourn the loss of your X fiance.  Those kinds of things you will never get over.  And those idiots should have absolutely NO afftect on what you think or how you feel! F* them all!!  <br>  You need to start focusing on what makes YOU happy. F* what everyone else says or things.  You have had too much sh*t taken from you... You need to spend sometime to nurture and help your self.  <br>  Good luck with this one *GOD bless*|`|a118712788b949ba8b8b77bd0ee29406aa	I have alot of sympathy for you!my friend has rapped when she was younger as well.i dont really know what to tell you.like are you seeing a doctor?i think that counselors are the best thing for this.if you dont already have one maybe you should try it and see how it all works out. and im so against rape and abuse and everything so my sypathy for you  means alot!i dont know if that really helped though.well i wish you good luck with ur problems and getting them resolved.it will get better it will just take awhile!<br>    good luck!!|`|ac8b9f6fe284c084e7924a93b7445ef8aa	i'm sorry all of that has happened to you, i've been in the same kind of situations myself....... do you go to counselling? sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't, you need to decide whether it will have a positive effect on your life or not. i know it might feel like you need your ex boyfriend, but you don't, believe me. sometimes people who have been raped tend to cling to men in their life, because they need someone to support them. <br>  <br>  i used to be really reliant on my ex boyfriend but i'm much happier on my own and single. putting flowers on your ex's grave isn't a good enough reason for your friends to be little bitches. if they can't understand that you respected your ex a lot, tell them to get the ***** out of your life.<br>  <br>  if you and your ex get back together, make sure it is for the right reasons. show him you're independent without him and capable of standing on your own two feet and it'll show him you are worthy of his respect. making yourself throw up won't show him that you are a strong woman. <br>  <br>  i used to suffer with bulimia, and for me the best way to cope was keeping myself busy. if i felt like binging, i went out with friends, or exercised, because it made me feel like i was controlling my weight without being unhealthy. constantly vomiting will permanently swell your neck, rot your teeth and ruin your insides. i know how much of a struggle it is stopping purging, but you will have to face it at some point.<br>  <br>  don't spend the rest of your life reflecting on what has happened to you. keep to yourself for a while, buy some nice clothes, make up, whatever makes you happy. this is one time in your life where you DESERVE to be selfish. <br>  <br>  i've been raped, had people die, nearly died several times and got through an eating disorder. after 17 years of constant pain, i'm finally happy. just wait it out, you'll get better and stronger. you have to be tough and remember that if you work hard enough, you'll have a beautiful future.
AA10938125	Coming from someone that has had surgery for obesity I can tell you that although you loved her unconditionally there was obviously something wrong with the relationship to be broken off.  Yes maybe she isnt dating the right men but give her time.  Its a big change going from someone fat to skinny.<br>  <br>  If you honestly think that you two can work out then tell her how you feel and if you dont want it too then tell her that you cant hear her stories about dating as it hurts you to hear her getting used.  Being fat does get lonely and I can tell you its nice to get attention when you dont have as much fat to hide behind.<br>  <br>  Maybe she needs to work on her self-esteem before she works it out with anyone.  Coming from someone that is currently in her shoes its empowering to know you are going to change but there are demons that come back to haunt us cause being overweight is not about eating its alot more than that.<br>  <br>  Your question was How do you Let Go of Your Ex?  I say a relationship should not have to worked at it should just happen.  Maybe she doesnt think she is worth loving, HENCE being fat?  I think you need to concentrate on yourself and find someone to move on with instead of investing all your time in her dating business.....<br>  <br>  Good luck to you Buddy|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	it's hard to let go of someone we love, but as long as u refuse to give her up, u will never be able to move on. have u spoken to her, and told her how u feel and that u want her back? it will be hard for her to return to a marriage when she is getting so much attention from others.if she were willing to go to counciling maybe it would work.|`|9dac97711aa73c2c5c60ce495fc4599faa	well...you want to know how to let go.....and then you wanta know how you can work it out?????.....Deciding what you want would be a first good step.|`|AA11172946	good luck.....maybe something better will be coming your way......try going to a book store or coffee house to find someone  again good luck|`|fc5a3f08aaf7d243450e4638caeeb387aa	She was FAT, & now she isn't! What a great feeling that must be, for her. Men probably DO find her attractive, now, & she's making the most of it. What's wrong with a woman in her 30s, with kids, dating? Not a damn thing! What u need to do, is get out more with ur buddies; go bowling, play basdketball, football, go to the games,quit sitting around feeling sorry for urself. If u still have feelings for her, ask her out, treat her like a girlfriend, not an exwife. Above all, DON'T tell her the other guys r out for only 1 thing, she knows it, but she's out having fun. When u tell her that, u're actually putting her down, & she probably resents that, I would. Also, when u tell her things like that, it makes u look bad; u sound vindictive, & jealous.  If she won't go out with u, take the hint, & back off; it's not going to be easy, but u have to let her go. It's the best thing for both of u. Yes, u will meet someone else, but don't jump in with both feet, give it time. Good Luck.

Well first, you should apologize and try to explain your point of view, but don't forget to hear hers too. There is a saying for guys, "bros before ho's." I guess the girl equivalent would be "sisters before misters." They both basically mean one thing. Boyfriends and girlfriends often come and go, but friends will stick by you and it is important to remember that they have feelings too.<br>  <br>  If you are confident that your boy friend won't cheat on you and your best friend wouldn't cheat with him, then you have nothign to worry.|`|3b801b8cc12433f531a0b5a16b641edaaa	First of all your friend has no reason to get mad over your b/f because he's your b/f not hers and if you told her to stop clinging to your b/f and she get pissed???? oh no!! i wouldn't have that, you got to stand up to her and tell that heifer "Why don't you get your own b/f instead of trying to take my on the down low" and just tell your friend you don't appreciate her trying to make moves on your b/f (boy friend). you also need to check your man because he shouldn't even allow that (but hey men will be men), but still he should have enough respect to tell your friend to back off.

So I guess there's no point of retaining him in your mind...

Eventually that person becomes comfortable and begin to expect the person to do for them, because they know that the other person will.  But it becomes a serious problem when the costs outweigh the benefits and you have to ask yourself is it really worth it?  So be careful of how much you do for a person you truly care about, specifically when nothing is being reciprocated!

Don't give up and be depressed at home though. Be persistent and go out and have fun! You only live once.

It's loving them for the whole person that they truly are.  It's knowing you could forgive them no matter what they did (if they were TRULY sorry).  It's loving them so much that you care more about their happiness than your own (and they feel the same way).  It's wanting only the best for them, wanting to help them anytime they're hurt or sad, wanting to protect them and make sure they never get hurt, wanting to share every moment with them because you know that in every moment you share, your joys will be more than doubled and your sorrows will be more than halved.  It's truly understanding them, having this indescribably close and wonderful connection between the two of you in your heart and soul.<br>  <br>  That's not a complete definition of love, but when you find it, you'll know... trust me.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  Maethoriel|`|52d341f2424b7a2621efa35b9aacc785aa	I know I love someone when I'm comfortable with them and when they're comfortable with me.

I'd do some thinking about what you would want from someone who loves you, and ask yourself if that's what you can give this person.  If times were tough, would you be able to give more than you recieve with this person?  In the end, love is about giving.

Basically friendship should not be based on conditions, if it is than it is not a real friendship.<br>  There will always be people to disapprove of who she is with and what she does but if she does not go with her heart and her instincts than she will never be happy.  Tell her to live for herself not for her friends.|`|AA10469633	The only thing that you can do is be yourself. Try just talking to her friends, maybe they don't have positive feeling towards you.

DW about it!!|`|866d39e4210b61963dcae80d20dc511eaa	well a guy isnt very mature at 13. or 15. or 19. they gotta get over 20 before they start to mature properly. really its up to you if you think that way? i mean nothing wrong with dating sum1 thats 13 when your 15. i know a 17 yr old guy dating a 14 yr old and they are having a great relationship. but don't expect him to be very mature. he doesn't think allot about the right thing so if you can stand his 13 yr old attitude its cool.. there are some 11 yr old kids more mature then 20 yr old guys. its just how they grew up. not that I'm very good but i knew allot and tried to be as mature as i could when i was 13. (I'm 16 now.) but i still didn't do too good. its how mature he is not the age.
a972adc2efd29b93b5429f23182dd251aa	No matter what the reason or the consequences telling the truth is always best.  Sometimes it hurts others, but if you continue to tell lies eventually it will catch up with you and 'your friend'. It's like chasing the wind.<br>  You will feel better within yourself for telling the truth and if your friend is angry or cuts you off, then realistically they are not deserving of you.  Honesty is a high honor, and if you allow yourself to compromise then you become THEM, when you could be YOU.  <br>  Make a stand with them and yourself and gain self-respect and honor.|`|AA10189093	lie|`|0617ac03f8d50c24b03684593765ff5baa	that's allways hard to decide, but experience taught me its best to hide the truth if its going to hurt many people. i prefer not to tell a lie, instead i do not give an answer at all.its up to other people to find out what the truth is.|`|30974455ec61cca11ec9d283c98e0381aa	This is a very good question! It is a very hard question to answer as well. Whenever I run across a problem such as this, I always go with whichever route is "The Greater Good".<br>  <br>  For instance, if you are going to tell a lie to save someone who is a good person, of course it would be best to lie for them. This is an example of when telling a lie for someone is an absolute good thing.|`|931cf24831a105755747ad37fa04b9d4aa	i don't think all lies are sinful given the certain circumstances|`|AA12225085	the truth b/c once u tell one lie . u have to tell another, then another then pretty soon all u have is a web of lies.|`|5825b127e855ade7228fb264c9469efcaa	well i cant really answer without a little more information once you post more info i will answer it better and more detail <br>  <br>  Thank you|`|6b3fd03bf2731149d787f9a6723995ceaa	Well, the end justifies the means. So I say, I'll lie just to save someone rather than following the golden rule and end up messing somebody's life. However, one should evaluate the situation first. This is imperative. If your decision gives benifits and can actually outweigh the damage then that's a good call.|`|76cce44718012adca949c6f80b98d94aaa	The best answer that i can give you is not to get involved... because you will never really determine what will happen if you lie or tell the truth.  <br>  I was in the same situation as you... my friend had told a lie to her boyfriend and begged me not to say anything. He confronted me and i told hI'm exactly this " im sorry, but i am not getting involved in this, its between you and her not me"  <br>  If you don't know what to do , then maybe you shouldn't do anything... and let it be.<br>  Depending on the severity of the situation then you should know what to do.|`|f8c46faedac789438dad1164608317e9aa	In most cases, tell the truth in a tactic way is the best.

c184af8bd9403ca9afedc4e0bbf77beeaa	Who is it going to be?<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend is still talking to his ex- GF and it's getting to the best of you. Do you know if he still have feelings for her? Did he ever recover from the nasty break-up? <br>  <br>  Well you have communicated with your BF and told him how his involvement with his ex bothers you. Your feelings are real, and I am sure you feel hurt by him disregarding your request of cutting things off with his ex.  Maybe this is way too much for you to handle and maybe you don't need to stick around to see what he's going to decide. And the reason why I say that is because his ex will always be a threat to you. Even when she is no where around, you will always wonder if he is hiding something from you when it comes to his ex. And what good is a relationship if you can't trust him.<br>  <br>  You can't change your BF but you can change how you decide to react to his decision. So Let's be real, you're jealous, scared, and feel hurt. (nothing is wrong with that, your feelings are real)<br>  <br>  But your situation is very uncomfortable for you and it's unhealthy.<br>  So why let him choose? Why can't you choose what you will and will not tolerate? Don't try and think you will be okay with his decision. <br>  <br>  I think it's time for you to move on before it becomes too painful for you to walk-out on your own.|`|AA12054896	Go ahead and let him choose I'm sure you are a way better person than to settle for being second best!|`|abe4e409bd0aa6f6fec1d42335358af8aa	Well I am friends with my ex's and they got GF's and I wanted to let you know as long as your guy loves you and is with you why would you dump him you also cannot control someone and how they forgive and how they want to be friends with someone that is insecure and selfish on your part if you really love this man you will be happy that he is in love with you he is with you not his ex and if they want to be friends still then let them I dated guys that had ex GF as friends but it never bother me for I knew I was loved by the guy

17796069ac9db13e8face6f2e53ad8e2aa	Maybe he will wise up sooner than later! If his parents passed within 3yrs. that is about the grieving time it takes to get over it. He will learn to see you in another light. Just stay close be his friend, kind, compassion, caring, considerate.  Listen to him find out what some of the things his mother use to do for him and then you do it ( I know that sounds tacky) but it works..I use to think the way to a man's heart was through his stomach!  LOL..and that works on occasion.  some guys just need nurturing. Commitment is a big step for one who hasn't done that and is older..Comfortability is usually paramount in their lives..No hassle, worries, cares other than themselves. These kind of people usually do little things that make others happy in their own little way..Good Luck keep plugging away..he'll come around..|`|AA10099568	you can still be with this guy you really love if that makes you happy.

If you have counseling available to you, take advantage of that as it would be a good starting point.  Otherwise, it may be helpful to read books on self-development that you can find at the library or bookstore.  Confidence usually grows over time.  Take it easy on yourself and figure out what would make you feel better about yourself.  It's got to be all about you though...you can't seek to change in order to hang onto a guy.

Doing something for someone else is the best way because it lets you prove to yourself you're a good, caring and smart person. A few suggestions:<br>  <br>  1) Smile and say thank you to a store clerk. That doesn't happen often and they appreciate it.<br>  2) Give money to a homeless person. It won't fix their problem but you'll never know if your gesture may get them thru to tomorrow and something could change for them.<br>  3) Call a friend just to say hello. Often there's something that's bothering them (even a very little thing)and they're helped just by you thinking of them.<br>  4) If you see a stranger on the street with a pretty dog or a cute baby, comment about it. They'll usually light up and feel good because of it.<br>  5) Give your mom flowers. No reason, just because. It will mean alot.<br>  <br>  Doing stuff like that is a two-fer...the other person is helped and encouraged and so are you. <br>  <br>   ----------------------------------------...<br>  there is always going to be someone who is better than you or prettier than you or who has nicer things than you...no matter how talented or beautiful you are. you cant compare yourself to anyone else! One might be better at soccer but you are probably better than her at a ton of things. keep believing in yourself and be proud of who you are!

You can go to the courts and they can give you advise as in to what to bring to the hearing. the information is actually free and sometimes there are lawyers who do pro bono work (free).

There was a time to dispute paternity, and that time was during the divorce process.  In MOST states, if you don’t dispute paternity during the divorce process, you’re scr*wed, because you're not allowed to go back later and do it.  There are a FEW states (Arkansas, for example) that will allow an ex-husband to dispute paternity and be relieved of future child support payments if a DNA test proves they’re not the biological father, but I’ve never heard that Indiana allows that, which of course, doesn’t mean that they don’t (but I doubt it).  I know you said you can't afford an attorney, but hubby REALLY needs to talk to one.  See if you can find one who will give you a free consultation (many do).|`|33ad6c6769aa595f0d92f06dce4e9106aa	You stated that he has two other children with this woman. What makes you think that he is only paying for the one which you stated may or may not be his. You married a man who came complete with a family. What right do you have to wish poverty on these children??? <br>  She has no right to withhold visitation. You can file in family court for a DNA test, you will most likely pay for it yourself. At the same time ask the judge for the visitation she is withholding.  In a lot of state if you are legally married at the time of birth then your husbands name goes on the birth certificate automatically.<br>  You have a life time of dealing with the issues which arise from your husband previous wife and the children of that union. Please don't take it out on the children,.... what a crude way of describing  a child , since that child may indeed be his. <br>  If she was awarded child support then your husband would have had to appeared in from of the judge already, he had amply time to dispute the third child as his, but apparently didn't.

AA12375526	You can't make a person quite smoking, it is a very addicting and hard habit to break and it is only made more difficult if the person doing the quiting is not ready to quit. I quit while I was pregnant with all three of my children, within the first month after having the first two, I was back smoking again. The last time did it for me. I went cold turkey all three times. I have known people that have had success with the nicotine gum. It is made more difficult by being around people that smoke, occasionally, under the "right" conditions I still want a cigarette, but I don't cave in. I tell myself that I just want the action of smoking, because I know that the chemicals are no longer in my system. If she is ready to quit, you need to support her, tell her to talk to her doctor about helping her to quit. If she needs to avoid people that smoke, then help her to avoid those people and situations, it also may help to find something that she can do instead of smoking. So when she craves a cigarette she has another action (something with her hands is best) to take that place. Also, be prepared for mood changes and crankiness. Remind her that she is doing the right thing and she is making a healthier decision for herself. Best of luck to both of you.|`|4e9535921abca0397ddc20b6e278acdfaa	You either accept her with her smoking or you walk away.

Have you seen "Never Been Kissed"?  If so, there's a scene where Rob (played by David Arquette) comes into the High School that Josie (played by Drew Barrymore) is attending as an undercover reporter who is very uncool, and Rob by rumors and innuendo makes Josie seem very cool and she becomes popular.  Popularity and "coolness" are really just an illusion people create.  You are cool and unique and interesting, especially when you accept yourself as you are and embrace life with enthusiasm!<br>  <br>  Don't hesitate to call people and arrange get-togethers or make plans to hang out!  By being the inviter, you place yourself in a stronger position than by being someone trying to get invited to go along with other people!  Suggest going to the movies, going out to eat, going for a walk, going shopping or window shopping, think of creative things your friends like and maybe work on building up a couple of friendships you really value and you think have potential to grow into closer friendships.  Have a movie-fest at your house, plan a time to try some new recipes together, set up an informal event with friends like a mini talent show or something, go to a concert.  Enjoy time by yourself, too, there's nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  Hope you have a wonderful winter vacation from school and a great spring semester!  Peace and blessing!

Be polite and leave girls the hell alone when they reject you.  Don't annoy them.  You may be friends if you wish, but remember that it won't go anywhere like it does in the movies.

b9dfc42b2145a50487373f61a3cdc90faa	Thats because people really dont understnd the escence of friendship. many'er times we become friends r make friends just because we need to have friends, but as we become closer it so happens that we dont like some character in them, due to which misunderstanding between friends rise n leads to situations that asks questions as u do.Thus to avaoid all such things we should note the point that friendship s all about understanding and sharring feelings. Always when we get have a ill feeling abt our friend, wat we hav to do is that to sit together disciss reagarding that,and thus a calm converstion gives a solution and the problem r the misunderstanding is solved.The one thing people should understnd s that keeping things inside ourselves always creates much prolems instead of solving it.Its like boosting a spark of fire into an explotion.SO B OPEN N FRANK ALWAYS N THATS SECRET OF LIFE WHICH MANY PEOPLE DONT DO.,WHEN U DO THIS FRIENDSHIP BECOMES THE WAY AS U THINK.ENJOY LIFE.BYE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0669614ffef05fb64482cd004c73848aaa	Well, I think I know what you're saying... It wasn't until recently when I had a crisis in life and everyone knew about it that I found my real friends, so to speak.  The ones that said good luck and ran away from me were weeded out and there were some I never even dreamed would be good friends and they were right there for me.  Sometimes it's much more than you hoped for and other times it is a disappointment, once you get to know the person it is not what you dreamed of or hoped for at all and then you can let it go or accept what they give you.  Good luck with all this!

Pero cuando estas con la otra no sientes miedo precisamente. Típico en los hombres: te quiero a ti pero me acuesto con otra. Ja! Es cierto que a veces se busca fuera lo que a uno le falta en casa, pero si te falta porque tu xica no esta segura, asi se lo estas dejando clarito, clarito: no la quieres. Por eso, habla con ella, dejala que haga su vida, y no le quites la oportunidad de encontrar a alguien que en realidad la quiera y la respete, porque tu no has sabido hacerlo. Si no, habrias esperado a que resolviera sus dudas, o crees que a ella no le apetece? Lo que pasa es que si te lo da todo y luego la dejas tirada, o la enga?as como estas haciendo ahora mismo, hace muy bien en no darte nada.

Si tu novia anterior no quiso tener relaciones sexuales contigo no es porque no te quiera sino que como dices no estaba convencida. Nosotras las mujeres necesitamos màs que amor para tener relaciones con un chico. Necesitamos tener la convicciòn y seguridad que el chico nos quiere y desea estar con nosotras y que no busca solo sexo. ?Amas a tu nueva chica? o ?solo estas con ella porque te da sexo? Date un tiempo para ti. Alejate por un tiempito de las dos y tomate tiempo para tomar una desiciòn sabia. Yo te diria que si en tu antigua novia veias a la mujer que buscas y en esta no, lo mejor es que la dejes tampoco se vale que estes con ella solo por sexo. Si tienes ese miedo a que tu antigua novia se entere es porque aùn la quieres. Busca en tu interior y respondete a ti mismo.|`|29af6eab749543d2f2994e15d0884554aa	Tienes bien claro que esa chava con la que andas no es la chava que buscas y solo andas con ella por sexo. Una relación no se basa en el sexo, hay mucho mas y si por una chava que te da "placer" vas a perder a otra que te da lo que en verdad buscas pues piensalo bien. Si en verdad quieres a tu novia y ella te quiere a ti entonces van a tratar de resolver sus problemas. Además tu mismo lo dices esa otra chava es solo una AMIGA nada mas que eso y no dices tener miedo de perderla a ella pero si tienes miedo de perder a tu novia. El sexo no lo es todo y creo que no vale la pena perder a una persona que en verdad te quiere por otra que solo quieres para pasar el rato. La decisión es tuya lo único que te puedo decir es PIENSALO BIEN Y MUCHA SUERTE, ESPERO QUE TOMES LA MEJOR DECISIóN.bye|`|fbca4951b0a478d5b9db3935e9f371c0aa	Mira seamos sinceros a tu novia no la amas, por que el amor todo lo espera, todo lo sufre, cuando amas a alguien, esperas a su tiempo, no al tuyo, lo que andabas buscando era una relación de tipo sexual que veias imposible con tu novia, la que tal vez si te amaba y para quien eras algo más que calentura de unos meses, eso amigo es "deshonestidad", por que no puedes decirte ser honesto si al tener la "oportunidad de cambiar a tu novia por una calentura, preferiste una aventura a la seriedad, imagina pobre chava qué le espera si sigue contigo, que cada que tengan alguna bronca o cada que se te antoje probar, le vas a poner el cuerno, "No hagas lo que no quieras que te Hagan", perdon que sea cruel, pero es la verdad, cuando amas esperas y eso no lo supiste hacer, en ese momento tu tuviste la oportunidad de cambiar lo mas por lo menos y te gustó puesto que llevas meses, vé hasta donde llegó tu ceguera por una calenturita que ya se pasó.!!!!!

Es posible que tu novio, al ver que ella aún se interesa por él (está claro que quiere volver) le de pena decirle que tiene una nueva novia. Ya se que suena tonto, pero es posible que le tenga cari?o y por eso no quiera hacerla sufrir aunque no quiera volver con ella.<br>  <br>  Entiendo que te den celos, yo me subiría por las paredes con una situación así, uf! tienes que hablar claro con él acerca del da?o que te hace a tí esto, al fin y al cabo ahora eres tú ( o deberías) ser más importante para él que su ex, así que si tiene que elegir a quién hacer da?o, debe ser a ella y no a tí.<br>  <br>  Si a ti te tranquilizaría que ella supiera que tiene nueva novia (es decir tú) díselo a él, para convencerle, dile que no es justo tampoco para su ex, puesto que en el fondo, no hace mal queriendo volver, ya que no sabe que está con nadie, es él quien lo está haciendo mal, no es bueno que ella esté con ilusiones de algo imposible (si realmente lo es, que te tienes que asegurar bien).<br>  <br>  En todo caso, evita hablar mal de ella (se que es dificil pero quedarías como una celosa patológica) intenta ser comprensiva, que él crea que sólo miras por el bien de todos (tuyo, suyo y de su ex).<br>  <br>  Bueno, si quieres algún consejo más encantada.<br>  <br>  Suerte.

It may be just a piercing to you but to your mom, you are her little girl(if you have children someday you will know what this means) and Moms don't understand why their perfect little beautiful darlings need to put a hole through their ear. I suggest letting her know you want it, remembering that your mom is kinda growing with you in the experience and she needs to go through her own motions and feelings over it-she knows your growing up.

I know that I thought I was ready for piercings when I was 13- but now know that I wasn't. Alot of piercings will leave a permanent scar- so make sure you have talked through the option with your mum. Don't just ask her straight out- let her know that you want to 'DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF...' whatever piercing, and explain why you want it. Listen to what she has to say too, that part of the adult decision making process.

Is there a reason why you want custody of the other woman' children?  It is unfair of him to expect you to care for them.  It seems like he wants everything his own way and doesn't care who he hurts.  If he goes back to her, will he try to get custody of your children?  I think you should tell him that you don't want 'her' children.  If he doesn't like it you are better off without him.  Take care of yourself and your children.

He should be able to tell you that he loves you.  Any old insecurities should not be in his relationship with you.  The past should be the past.  Maybe he was hurt by someone in his past.  You should not suffer for his past hurts.  Is he ready for a relationship???????????????<br>  He needs to heal from all the past pain.  If you truly love him, help him get counseling.  Do not pressure him into a relationship.  He needs to heal from the past relationships!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|01c7e7ddb974d2cd217d96108adcfbdfaa	he`s hurt, maybe everytime he said that he was hurt, I know the feeling, that should be|`|15c06db12b406eb00cb4028cbc5ef79daa	I would say run, personally.  I have been there where someone would only tell me they love me when they were drunk and it did not end very well.  It seems to me that you (like me) like to express your feelings through words and possibly touch.  He seems to be the complete opposite and this will only cause you a great deal of pain and insecurities.   I know that opposites attract but this seems to be too great of a gap.  Good Luck and I hope things work out for you!

Find out what in your life made you attract the ones who hurt you and change that part of you and you will attract the right person next time.  We attract certain people because of how we are.  For Example:  If you were abused as a child and no one did anything about it, you will attract abusive men in some form or another.  SO what ever it is, it is your personality that attracts these types of guys that hurt you.  Or maybe you anticipate getting hurt and sabotage your own relationship unknowingly.  Or you are afraid of success sub-consciously and sabotage anything you have that is good.  It could be anything.|`|e8851b9f0ff261603f2a648b1ce253ccaa	I've got just the solution for you. Don't throw it all away. There can be someone out there, for you. You can't let him just walk away. Listen to YOUR Heart. It can help you decide what the Truth is. We've taken our Heart, out of Love. And that's where it's suppose to come from. Your Heart knows right-from-wrong. Listen to it thump,thump,thump. Good Luck!

It's not always easy to have one definitive description to let you know that she digs you, but if you get that she does, then it'll get to a point where you will have to explicitly tell her that you like her and you wonder if she feels the same way, then take it from there. Life and love is always about taking the risk....and that's where all the fun lies! Hope it goes well!

They just leave you hanging because to them, dancing is as normal as pool is to guys.<br>  When you finish a game of pool, you dont ask for the guy's digits do you?|`|d52365ab5a6d2e2dc3849bb15bff5807aa	Hmmm, if you are not touching them, invading their privacy, and they danced with you in the first place (means you are not that bad looking), and you THINK you arent a bad dancer, the only other problem i can think of is some body odor

f8d4cae714307a0a3164daf34a9bd1f1aa	It's probably a trap.<br>  You are about to lose her.<br>  If you really love her, think hard about how to repair the damage that has been done.<br>  Never fight with a woman. You will NEVER win!!! Accept what she says and try to think of how to show her your point later. A smart man is a man who knows when to keep his mouth shut and his ears open.|`|28144eb29fc234a2e2c879b5109675a4aa	If your relationship has become boring, don't look outside the relationship for the answer. <br>  Be creative and find things you are both interested in.  <br>  <br>  I strongly feel if you would go ahead with the plans that you would totally ruin this relationship forever. <br>  <br>  It would be a disaster !!|`|08978edb64e3ad1547f9c30ccce0e022aa	DONT DO IT... it sounds like a bad idea to me|`|1ae7486c6f3527855ce2c2499f850ac2aa	goodness.

Is sex the main problem in your relationship to warrant that kind of suggestion? Ask yourself why you're fighting more and deal with that issue, not by having sex with someone else. How is that going to solve anything? Search within your heart and see if you really want to save your relationship. If the answer is no, then end it decently without resorting to doing something silly like this. You'll only end up getting hurt. There's no such thing as "strictly sex" when you love someone.|`|62f921279349557e9d980d226260cc5daa	is this really why she wants to do this?? or has some random caught her eye that she may want to "try out"??? if the relationship is destined to go anywhere it will overgrow the curiosity 4 otha ppl|`|a237671ab72c43821e4f4fa0c057ad10aa	That will be the end of your relationship.

MYiOedxzaa	I think you should slow your roll baby. You will scare her off....she's probably confused if she just got out of another relationship. and be catious you may be her fullfilment now that the other guy is gone. Don't over do it, 3 weeks is a very short time. and ifatuation feels like loving but it's not....|`|9e72911ad171f4c3a4cdd50efee9dff6aa	First, lay off the crack. 2nd, don't worry too much about it, it's most likely infatuation right now. If you keep this up with her she is going to end it cuz your getting annoying. I know where your coming from so you should probably back it down a little before she leaves and you'll be back on here asking why she left you.|`|6ecd031c25bf1e0f8830a51714c13800aa	I don't normally answer things in this category, rarely even look in it, but for some reason I did this morning and I can't seem to help but respond. I'm quite a bit older than you are and I hope that my life experience can speak to your heart. Just hear me out, okay?<br>  <br>  You've been dating this girl for 3 weeks and I know it seems to you that you're "in love." I suggest to you that after only 3 weeks, you are very much "in lust" and feel a wonderful passion for this girl but you hardly have had the time and knowledge of each other to feel true, deep, love for one another.<br>  <br>  Maybe this girl is a little more mature in wanting to take it slower. Get to know each other better. What is the rush? Enjoy the exploration of getting to know each others wants, likes, dislikes, dreams, personalities. It all goes so fast. Savor it. If you rush her, you may scare off the very girl for you just by your intensity. That can often warn a girl off, turn her off, whatever............but she won't be as responsive to you as she would be through calm, gentle, true curiosity about her and what is important to her.<br>  <br>  So you now have the choice. My advice is meant only as that. Advice. Take it or leave it.<br>  <br>  My best wishes to you.................. Casey

21c6d542a24b57f03cabb1677776d51aaa	Well you should probably be chatting with your boyfriend and not your virtual friends.  I can see why he'd be worried about it.  I mean that's how you met him and it's possible that you could meet someone else that you'd be interested in.  If it's not that big of a deal to you and you really want to show him you love him, give it up. :)|`|E0KsLMkOaa	No u arent. Though u should be careful in the chat rooms. And maybe u should spend a little time with him. Talk about movies or about both of u. some boys can can jealous of guys u hang out with. It just shows that he cares about u.|`|KwH9Jqpjaa	Your not being inconsiderate.   It's not wrong to still talk in chatrooms.   I chat in chatrooms and I made some friends.|`|8e15622aa1088300ab294a0ef495a901aa	He's afraid you'll find some one else. I mean, after all, it is how HE met you.<br>  <br>  Give him some attention, spread the love.|`|922d47b2f4cef80931090217f00652d6aa	not wrong but spend time with him too!|`|AA10665652	Yes, because you're committed. But let's cut it down to the real problem/ the core perhaps- The real problem is that, he's concerned that some of the strangers in the chat rooms that you enter, are flirtacius single (or not) men. And he's concerned that you will eventually leave him, for one of those men. And being that you met him in a chat room, it's undersandable that he feels that way. He wants to be the only man, you love.|`|72d9de10a2ab1169978957e193ac7e9eaa	It's perfectly fine to talk ing chat rooms, your boyfriend is just jealous because he's scared to lose you. Just let him know that he's the only one for you at the moment and have him cool it. Why should you give up your life for him? Best of Luck!! :)|`|Ja2Hp1JTaa	no..u juz hev to know ur limitations...|`|af4a79f131a8cb71bd0ed4a909195243aa	if your current time ratio for your bf and your chat room friends is like 1:1...make it into something like 10:1 for your bf i guess...so you spend more time with him so he can't complain =)|`|c03c557555be59fb54d4918f06b22d98aa	Oh wow, I am currently going through this same thing just it's him not me.. I think because of what society has done with our heads and lead us to believe that chat rooms are only about sex and being flirty that almost anyone at one time or another will feel how he feels and myself. But the thing we both have to remember is that if we are happy with ourselves and in our relationships then it shouldn't be a big deal.<br>  Sounds like your bf may have a case of the jealousy blues =( ..<br>  He needs to recover his self worth and realize, it's just talk nothing more.|`|ef08e6e4bd295b8d9d46fe8eddbc0994aa	No, he of all people should understand why you like the chat room.  Maybe he's insecure about ya'lls relationship because he has something to hide himself.  I know I'm always suspicious of my fiance doing something that I could picture myself also doing.  Confront him about it, and if he gets defensive then you know your answer.|`|m3RpoknKaa	tell him to get a life, does he own you now?|`|qzGqRwHcaa	As long as everything you talk about is innocent then you shouldn't feel guilty about it. let him seat with you while you chat to show him your doing nothing wrong. If he acts weird about it maybe he has a guilty mind about something.
N0Tk90Btaa	Turn to your friend and say, "Hey, do you have to get back to work (or whatever would be plausible)?"  They can either say "Oh yeah, you're right, thanks for reminding me.  See ya later, guys!" or "No, I can finish it next week."
4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Go with Ms.  She's one of those bitter feminist types.  Go with ma'am if you don't want to appease her.|`|00e47b0467b089b6749ef01c0fa9bef1aa	my guess would be Ms.  but you should ask her what she prefers.|`|08MvezVdaa	I believe the proper title is "Comrade".  It's usually quite fitting for those with hyphenated names.|`|876fed5d0d7a0e4f3cedf6316868026caa	My daughter kept her maiden name for business reasons.<br>  We use Mrs. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Jill|`|AA10294100	I'm married but chose to keep my family name rather than change it. I use Ms.|`|hpaFh7Exaa	I usually stick with Ms. Miss is for younger ladies, and Mrs. if they have their Husband's last name. Never say ma'am though, that can get you in trouble!|`|O9z08euDaa	use ms. it means married or not|`|ZUxaeb0waa	She's married  so it's   "Mrs."  and her last name.  It doesn't matter what she changes or doesn't change it to. You should still use her last name.
N0Tk90Btaa	Think of something fun to do ahead of time that you think you'd both enjoy, then go up to her and ask if she'd like to go with you to _____.  This is better than saying do you want to go out sometime?  What do you want to do?  I don't know, what do you want to do?  It shows you're someone with something going on, and it makes it less awkward and not as big of a deal...it's just like you were going anyway, why not invite her?  Good luck.|`|AA11446286	It depends on your level of relationship with the girl. Are you close friends or strangers? It would be easier if you were friends. you could ask her to eat out or go malling. If you're strangers start by a conversation on common topics like sports, entertainment and social issues. You could also ask people who know her; ask what she's into and the things she usually does. But don't be like a stalker. Hehehe... Goodluck. Just be yourslef and always smile.

b467bda9f5f95bd1124010af3bd4bac9aa	Para el amor no hay edad, no hay color, no hay fronteras, cuando te llega el amor sin buscarlo, ese es el amor verdadero porque no te importa si es mayor o menor, negro o blanco o de cualquier parte del mundo. Cuando la persona se pone a buscar a su media naranja con muchas cualidades no encuentra el amor verdadero; el amor es un sentimiento puro y limpio, cuando tu amas a ojos serrados y sientes las maripositas en tu panzita ese es el amor del bueno, pero no lo busques,llegara y <br>  dios quiera que esa persona sienta lo mismo  que tu.<br>  No importa quien sea mayor, lo importante es que sientan lo mismo.  Suerte.|`|9HkRr2pMaa	Si es verdadero amor no importa la diferencia de edades.  Yo se de parejas en donde tanto la mujer o el hombre son mayores que sus parejas y son felices, asi tambien se de parejas digamos normales en donde el hombre es uno o dos anos mayor que su pareja y son infelices.   Como digo, todo depende del amor que exista entre ambos, lo demas no importa.|`|5ccd7494f38eb87036fd42d91491c205aa	para el amor no existe la edad, y ademas no hay que juzgar a nadie por su edad..la mejor forma de comprobar que te ama es que te lo demuestre con actos, y no solo con palabras..porque alas palabras se las lleva el viento..recuerda siempre que la edad no es lo que importa..de hecho hay personas grandes que son inmaduras y chicos jovenes que son mas maduros que los grandes! mucha suerte!!|`|0685c0801b13b0807907261fa33a262baa	Te explico por experiencia propia<br>  <br>  Yo he tenido una relacion con una mujer 15 a?os mayor, cuando yo tenia 27 y ella 42, y dejenme decirles que fue la que me ense?ó los secretos del amor.<br>  <br>  Ella domina todo, y es tu maestra en todo. Te ense?a a tener el sexo mas placentero y a que ambos los disfrutemos, que al final es un arte. Ella te estudia y sabe que es lo que te gusta.<br>  <br>  Se dio cuenta que me gustaba y me exitaba que usara tacos altos aguja, se ponia tacos altos hasta para cocinar, regar el jardin, o ver televisión.<br>  <br>  Se dio cuenta que me gustaban sus piernas, se ponia minifalda hasta para salida de ducha.<br>  <br>  Se dio cuenta que me gustaba que hiciese shoeplay, se volvió una mujer que hacia shoeplay en todos lados. Obviamente empezo a no usar tacos aguja con amarras, sino de solo meter el pie.<br>  <br>  En otras palabras, me tenia babeando tarde/ma?ana/noche y en todo momento. Y en verdad, el sexo lo disfruté muchisimo, para que, a todo nivel. Yo pensaba que dominaba la situacion, pero quien la dominaba era ella.<br>  <br>  Por otro lado, para las fiestas principales, no saliamos juntos, cada uno por su lado, por el tema de que ella tenia su grupo de amigos y yo los mios con mucha diferencia de edad, por eso no saliamos juntos. Solo nos veiamos a solas y en su casa, que vivia sola.<br>  <br>  Fueron 4 a?os muy intensos, nos veiamos 1 a 2 dias los dias de semana, y de vez en cuando un dia los fines de semana, de ahi, cada uno salia por su lado.<br>  <br>  Al final terminamos porque ella empezo a tener problemas economicos por todos lados, y como que esperaba quizas alguna persona que la mantenga, condicion economica que yo no la tenia. Empezamos a pelear por eso y se resquebrajo en menos de 2 meses.<br>  <br>  Terminamos, estoy muy agradecido con ella, pero fue una de las relaciones mas bellas que he tenido.|`|3198b7f30f7a0969ac3309397ae858a3aa	da igual si se quieren-|`|462e6d51c98e52db013924ee4ddc013aaa	kreo k en el amor no hay edad pero konforme pase el tiempo se va ver el estrago k se hace en kada uno si en vda hay amor no importa pero si solo fue de momento les deseo suerte|`|7ec9811ef84fb7fe781c524945250859aa	no hay edad solo se necesita amor y sinceridad!!!<br>  <br>  todas las edades tienen su dulzura!!!|`|e6704677a15eaf68e838dcd0dc0e823caa	Creo que es indistinto.

03e126d8c1c8c7d68859a5f8a4c1a7b1aa	Segun dicen el noviazgo es para conocer la otra persona y limar las asperezas, o sea ver las cosas que perjudican la pareja y mejorarlas durante esta etapa, la cual es la mas linda porque todo es romanticismo y amor pasional. Me parece que tendrias que ver cuales son las razones por las cuales pelean tanto. Alguien me dijo una vez que para saber si estas con la persona correcta o casarte es una buena desicion pensaras de esta forma: busca todas las cosas que te molestan de esa persona: actitudes, reacciones, costumbres. Y ahora imagina viviendolo todos los dias de tu vida. Seria una convivencia armoniosa? "Lo que molesta durante el noiazgo, se hace insoportable en el matrimonio". Mucha suerte y espero que las cosas por las cuales pelean tu y tu novio solo sean trivialidades.|`|YX5SZAOkaa	mira tengo una amiga que no hacia mas que pelear con su novio,todo el noviazgo la pasaron así que cortaban y luego volvían, hasta que se casaron , no te voy a decir que los primeros a?os como 3  estuvieron igual de peleoneros, pero ahora los envidio de ver como se aman de eso hace como 8 a?os y tienen ya 2 hijitos. así que tu sabrás si le entras al matrimonio. te deseo que seas muy feliz.|`|d845b80caf57f0f74eb5b17e7e2e11f5aa	mmmmm...<br>  Despues es todo peor!!!!!!!!!Casarse y convivir desgraciadamente arruina todo!!!!|`|540844dae858f4b9c284ffadbbd36a1caa	mira yo tambien estoy de novia y en esos dias d estress uno pelea hasa porque te miro mal o lo q asi parecio....trata de encontrar las razones q aveces son estupidas x las q pelearon...si realmente se aman y se comprometen a mejorara la situacion mejorara. eso depende solo de ti, y si el no puede evitar las peleas ayudalo tu y no le eches mas le?a al fuego...suerte n todo!!|`|7408b010a936874c106d959785c793c7aa	Creo que justamente tienen que aprovechar el noviazgo para mejorar su relación, porque una vez que se casen y la convivencia haga lo suyo,puede ser que todo cambie para peor. O podés hacer como yo: convivan un tiempo para ver cómo se llevan y después deciden. Conviví 5 a?os con mi marido y nos casamos muy convencidos de lo que queríamos.<br>  Beso.|`|cd9cbdafaaa2e27e5a6ad5a597395f3daa	mal, mal, el matrimonio es algo tan bello cuando hay amor y respeto, es de lo mejor llegar a casa o ver que llega tu pareja<br>   y platicar y pasarsela bien,  sin embargo antes de casarte deben solucionar su forma de ser, evitar peleas y si logram llevarse bien sin peleas, puedes pensar en casarte, de lo contrario lamento decirte que lo de ustedes o terminara en divorsio o llevaran un matrimonio imposible, piensalo el matrimonio no cambia el caracter, ni lo hace mejor o peor ser humano.|`|kiasXdX1aa	Lo siento amiga, pero la verdad es que si las cosas cambian va a ser para peor.

Creo que siempre estamos en condiciones de mejorar, para mejorar en las relaciones. Animo, si se aman, hablenlo y busquen juntos la solución... y ríanse de ustedes también, que el humor ayuda mucho.

3e48f429b671dcc535739160b469fac0aa	I would definitely stay away from the floor length gown for a summer wedding. Although that might be what she likes, it just won't go with the theme of your big day. <br>  <br>  As for letting the girls pick their own dresses, that trend is becoming more and more popular with couples. All you have to do is pick the color and desired length (if any) and the girls can pick the dress they look best in ... that way everyone will feel comfortable. Great idea!!!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Sure, you could. I think it looks nice if something about the MOH is different.|`|3vA69tmcaa	I think you ought to let them choose their own length.  <br>  <br>  I do like the idea these days when each bridesmaid gets to choose her own dress in a certain color range like blues/green (for something beachy), pinks/green (for something summery), orange/rust (for something autumny).  Is that what you're doing?|`|0c1347ff04806a3ccddde0dd23d0c973aa	Although I'm not married, I have been involved in weddings in the past, and personally, I wouldn't have one long dress and then others short, mainly because it might look kinda funky in the pictures - like she didn't get the message about what you wanted the dresses to look like or something :) ... <br>  <br>  Maybe, to distinguish her a little bit, make her bouquet slightly different?  Or have her wear a slightly different shade of color?<br>  <br>  All in all, the only really important thing is how you want things to be - your guests won't care one way or the other, and if they do, then too bad, b/c it's your day! :)  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CHrhUkvVaa	It's fine if the dresses are a bit different but I think it would look better if they were all the same length.|`|ccqIYm0eaa	uniformity is nice, but in the end it's your decision.  if you want them all to wear carmen miranda hats, they have to.  :o)  choose whatever you think will make you happiest, and don't worry about what you "should" or "should not" do.  of course, if it's going to be really hot, short would be more practical.|`|1aLIiYaFaa	I think its best to go with the same length for everyone.  For pictures, it will look better if everyone else is the same, so all eyes will be on the beautiful bride.|`|AA10230357	Its your wedding but i would like all one knee-length. Just because your the only one that should stand out on that day & depending on where you live you don't wan't you MOH sweating up a storm I live in Texas.|`|d7eca609d6df21e2f2108880b6276773aa	I let all my girls choose their own dresses, with only two requirements.  I chose the color/designer, and requested floor length gowns.  I think since the dresses will all be somewhat different, it's best for the overall "look" of the wedding party to be in the same length dress. Short dresses convey a bit more of a casual look to some degree, while floor/ankle length are more formal.  I think your pictures will also look nicer if everyone chooses the same hem.  It may look odd if you and 3 of your girls are in gowns and one in a shorter style.  Perhaps the only caveat to this uniformity of length would be if you had all adult ladies, and one junior bridesmaid, as the shorter dress may look more age appropriate.  Congrats!|`|d9ec8f502a2784f3ce2faa2e01e03e5eaa	I think uniformity looks nicer given the two options you mentioned.|`|f5933cd887c28f2d1a8cd77cc85e45b7aa	different lengths will look just fine, and definitely designates a person of status.  however, outdoors and in the summer, ususally means warm and a long dress is difficult to wear.  you could go for tea length (about the ankle/midcalf) which will looks much more like a summertime dress, rather than full length.  you could also set your moh apart by letting her wear a different color or give her a coordinating sash or bow.  for example: put all your maids in blue with a pink sash and your moh in pink with a blue sash. you can do a lot to make her stand out. or if you would prefer to have her look like everyone else, then make them all be the same length, color, etc.  it really won't matter either way. why?  because its your wedding and you can do whatever you want, you ultimately have to be happy. because if you are unhappy, everyone will be unhappy. so go with what you like.<br>  <br>  congrats!|`|vFfYwImWaa	My sister did the same thing for her wedding this past summer, with the only rule being that all the dresses had to be the same color. We ALL found a style that we loved and looked nice in, but still looked like we belonged together and complimented the bride perfectly. I think my sister looked better by having everyone else look good, so no attention was taken off her at all. In the end it is your day, so do whatever feels right for you. Congratulations!!

ddb296eea9cd358d05aa8ac208011a1faa	Family is important and things run so much  more smooth when everyone gets along. Unfortunately if you love him and he is who you want to spend the rest of your life with then he becomes your family.  Go with your heart. Your family will either come around or it will be there loss not being part of your new family.  They dont pay your bills or put a roof over your head. You do what you feel|`|66e1cfca2cc71016c98ff0a315f5c225aa	hi there,I'm a black man,u stated that u love yoUr man time can tell. ur parents will never like your boyfriends, its his job to make your parents want him.you are strong don't give up on him or yourself love can move a lot of things. don't stop talking to Ur parents once everything goes the way u plan they'll welcome him. i hope u have a plan for the relationship.|`|AA11289385	teach him vietnamese. dont mention him to your parents at all. next time you are at home, they will probably ask u themselves. u will see that after sometime, they will get used to the idea.i had the same problem.|`|AA11948690	Tell your parents that they raised you to be a loving person (they did, didn't they?) so why are they surprised that you love someone for who they are, not what they are? Ask them what they think will happen if you marry this guy? Will the world split in two? Will everyone in the world shun you? Most people in the world are so used to interracial relationships that they don't even blink an eye now. Ask them would they have a problem if he was white. Ask them why they don't like him. Ask them if they ever consider how they make your boyfriend feel, do they even care? Ask them if they're nice people, and if they say they are, ask them how can they treat a person that way. Ask them why they don't see your boyfriend as an individual rather than a representative of the entire black race (which he is not). Ask them how they would feel if you were dating a white guy and his family thought that you weren't good enough for him and they were disappointed in him? Ask them if they realize that not everyone in the US thinks Vietnamese are so great. Ask then if they realize that a lot of people put Asians and Blacks and Latinos, etc. in the same category?<br>  <br>  <br>  If you REALLY love this guy and want to marry him, you might have to make a hard decision. You have two choices: make your parents happy or make yourself happy. They raised you to be a good, honest person. If they don't believe you're making a good decision, then they're pretty much admitting that they don't think they did a good job of parenting. But I'm guessing that after a while, if you two last long enough, they will come around.|`|NLRkD63eaa	The best thing to do is to continue discussing to your parents about your relationship with your boyfriend. I know it's hard but if you can convince them to understand that this man is the love of your life, things will be easier. Asian parents usually give in to their children after lengthy discussions so stay your ground.|`|0bGAP0afaa	This happens with a lot of families but it is not as bad as it used to be.You should let them know how much you care for each other, and if they complain ask them how they would feel if they were in a situation where they were disliked because of their race. If your parents got to know your boyfriend and saw how well he treated you and how much you liked him, im sure they will be impressed. If possible try to invite him to dinner or so. Ask exactly why they dont like him.Are you sure its becuase hes black?If is, tell them that if you love each other, shouldnt it not matter what color each other are?Good luck.|`|14A1nm92aa	listen to your heart bump what your parents say, if they really love you they will learn to deal with it|`|2ad181c21364a9bc452bc03d80d57598aa	He's the love of your life? Well, I know you love your family, but if you love him, do what you want. My family didn't like my husband for a really long time. Not because of his race, but they still didn't like him. They do now. But. I understand it sucks to not be able to share your love with your family, you should tell your parents that you love him, that you respect him and you are going to marry him whether they like it or not, I know you don't want to disrespect them. But you may regret it for the rest of your life if you let your parents rule your life.|`|9BIDjSlXaa	keep with him. It's your decision, and I'm really sorry for you that your parents don't understand. Many asian parents, including mine, prefer marriage to their own race. Keep on trying to persuade you parents, and if they still don't agreee, marry him anyway; it's your life. Oh, and perhaps you should talk to your boyfriend about this. Listen to what he has to say.|`|AA11595294	Well that is sad that your family can't except him,  but if you love him like you say you do you will keep him and marry him like you want to.  Your family will love you regardless.  Especially when you both decide to have babies, the grandparents (yours included) will be coming around.|`|EMa4M1uHaa	He obviously loves you. And it seems like you two belong together. Color and race shouldn't matter. But you have to remember your heritage. Your parents sound like they are old fashioned, and would like to see you with someone of your ethnic background. But, if they want really truly want to see you happy, they should accept your boyfriend no matter what. Maybe he should take some lessons, go to school, and learn how to speak your language. That could possibly break a barrier.|`|d09de8b8cb63a9207c5661051a8483fdaa	From the sounds of it, you have deep feelings for this man. I understand that family is important, especially in matters of the heart, but love must take precedence over family in these times. The fact that your boyfriend's family love you shows my that your parents may still share the normal conservative feelings their parents probably had. My best advice is to go with your heart, whether or not that means "disobeying" your parents, Good Luck with your decision, and I wish you the best either way.|`|efaeb5b2fa80f6005c5fbf4063c1b49eaa	This looks like a question for the experts on Black men dating other races of women..you know, black women.  Let me give it a try and see if I can paraphrase their typical response.<br>  <br>  First your family is obviously racist, because in matter of racism, blacks cannot be capable of racism. Your family doesn't like blacks because of negative sterotypes perpetrated by evil white men, and picked up by other races..such as yours.<br>  <br>   Secondly your man has self esteem issues and a self hatred for even dating you.  If he can't see the wisdom in dating or marrying a "strong black woman" then he has problems.  He's obviously marrying you because your weak minded, and won't challenge him, because a black woman "don't put up with no shyt from a black man".   <br>  <br>  I'll end this with.."why don't you marry your own race and leave our black men alone"..<br>  <br>  Now for myself, I think you should marry who you want, however if I was to give him advice, I'd tell him NOT to get married, not for racial reasons, but it doesn't make good business sense for any man to be married.|`|qCb51jnJaa	wow u should try 2 get them to see , race does not matter its whats inside that counts, and if u really love this man, then  i think u should be with him|`|AA11556445	You're dating him not your parents. :)
423bf3f45a232d9163c040d153f7ad49aa	Everyone wants to know.. so here r some signs<br>  <br>  **How to tell if he likes you<br>  (and if he's flirting with you in his special own guy-way).<br>  <br>  A lot depends on the type of guy and his individual personality.<br>  <br>  Shy Guys<br>  These are tough to crack sometimes...<br>  ~ He'll look at you, until you turn around, then boom, he's looking the other way.<br>  You may 'feel' like he's watching you - but he's hard to catch at it<br>  ~ He may do something physical - like grab you in a play way, poke you, play with your hair...<br>  (Remember when you were really young and the guy you liked punched you or tackled you?)<br>  ~He may be working really hard to pay attention to you, but doesn't quite know how...<br>  <br>  ~He may ask a friend of yours about you - he'll say it's just for "friend of mine" that wants to know about you.<br>  ~ He talks to everybody else - but when you're around he turns silent, or chokes up.<br>  You seem to accidentally bump into him a lot of different places.<br>  ~He may not say a word to you, but he shows up in the same line, at the same movie, etc.<br>  ~He'll give you a little smile from across the room, but if you get near, he won't look up.<br>  !! Basically - the BIG clue is that his behavior changes when you're around (compared to when he's around his buds or other girls).<br>  !!DEAD Giveaway - when you talk to him he turns red.<br>  (Bingo - you can pack that puppy up and take him home...) <br>  <br>  **These are some of the more subtle clues - keep your eyes open - you may have more guys flirting with you than you realize!!!<br>  <br>  ~ He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation.<br>  It may take you by surprise. You might have been talking when he was around and two weeks later he'll say, "Well, you like orange fizz..."<br>  <br>  ~ His voice changes when he talks to you in a group. He may say "Hey." to everyone with you, but the "Hey." to you is a little different.<br>  His voice gets softer when the two of you talk. <br>  <br>  ~Sometimes he stares straight into your eyes.<br>  <br>  ~ His eyes get 'soft' when he looks at you. They change slightly or get relaxed around the edges. It's subtle, but you can tell if you watch...<br>  (You may already be aware of it at a subconscious level - that's what made you start wondering if he likes you...)<br>  <br>  ~ When he's near you or talking with you, his eyes travel in a little circle around your face and land back on your eyes. (Like he's looking at your whole face - then back to your eyes.)<br>  <br>  ~ He watches your lips. (Dead give away.)<br>  <br>  ~ His friends start asking you questions - if you haven't met him yet - they may ask what your name is. Or may ask you what you think about 'him.'<br>  <br>  ~ If his friends are paying attention to you after he's been staring at you - it can mean that he's been talking about you.<br>  <br>  ~ He tells you that you smell nice...<br>  (No hidden meaning here - it's a good thing.)<br>  <br>  ~ He might act weird around you or seem very nervous. His behavior may just plain change when you're around.<br>  If he's normally quiet, he may get louder, or vice versa. It's the difference in behavior that's the clue.|`|2a5260866d6082125b158edee76cc4c9aa	touch his leg and see if his levis rise|`|AA11275232	If he asks for a phone number, always looks at you smiling. Laughs and pays attention when your talking to him. Also if he acts shy in front of your friends, if he replies to notes you write him. If he always wants to hang out. That kind of thing. GOOD LUCK!!!!!|`|zLjJ4Hn2aa	if they compliment you alot<br>  if they look at you while you not looking and then when you turn they look away<br>  they try to be around you<br>  they listen to you<br>  he always has eye contact with you when you guys are talking<br>  if hes seems to always be near you <br>  if he hugs you more than normal (if y'all are close) <br>  if he makes an effort to look good around you<br>  he makes cute comments <br>  if he shows up at random places where you are because he saw you there.<br>  if he only recognizes that your around and no one else. <br>  if he is there for you <br>  (however all guys are different these are what i do to show it)

b9cVOwv0aa	well from ur descriptions i think i can roughly guess his char. (I'm guessing!!) he dosen't have MSN and i have a feeling he dosent talk in class as well(a loner?). U say he pay attention to the girls who are talking and laughing, does he still pay attention when they are not? If he dosen't then he just have a great sense of curiosity. As for saying saying 'have a nice weekend kayla' i can deduce that he dosen't think badly of you so there's a chance of a relationship. I also think he's shy.<br>  <br>  Personally if u want to have a relationship with him. u need to make the first move. Nothing too expected. Try find some excuse to be near him and talk to him. Listen carefully to what he says and watch intently to his body language. U might be able to find some clues about his feelings towards you.<br>  <br>  This is my opinion and suggestions. U don't have to follow them|`|152159f23bbdcc066b8d6681aefc4f91aa	it doesn't have to end up in a relationship does it?<br>  whatever happened to just being friends first?<br>  talk to him,it never hurt to do that,or has the cat got your tongue.<br>  might seem hard but its not really.<br>  and stop caring about what people think or say,you came into this world alone and you might just go out that way.<br>  some things you never really know till you try,so go ahead, jump!!!|`|91a79d8f962d97db11caaba0c160723baa	Well, I would suggest you to go and talk to him.

Whats the worse that could happen?

5pYV9go1aa	From what I see, this guy is very confusing. And once a guy is confusing, that is a red flag - especially if, when no one else is around, he's your "talk to me for hours we are so close and going to prom together!" buddy, but in school he says NOTHING? That's a problem. If he doesn't even say hello, then he doesn't want to give people the impression that perhaps he has an interest in you. Why? Because for the simple fact that he doesn't want people to know meaning, he isn't that interested. Guys who like girls break their necks to say hello, walk her to her next class, etc. If he isn't doing that, then you can tell him your feelings but it might be awkward if the feelings are not reciprocated. He is going to prom with you, so there is no doubt an interest, but if you hear he likes another girl maybe he is only doing it to get a reaction from her? Maybe not, but seriously ask him what is up with him not speaking to you in class but behind closed doors is all buddy buddy. Have you seen the movie "A Walk to Remember"? Well that is exactly what happened...Landen (I think that was his name) wanted help from the main girl (Mandy Moore) for the school play and came to her house after school when no one saw them and was all talkative but in person acted like she wasn't there. Obviously you like him really - if you didn't, you wouldn't be on here trying to decipher his mixed signals. But in the question asking if he likes you back, the only answer you can get that is accurate is by him (but as I said - BEWARE...asking before prom could cause disasters if he says he doesn't feel the same). For now, he is playing a little game, so you know that "two can play that game." Don't bother asking him this and that - wait on prom night to profess the feelings. The worse that could happen is you arrive home feeling slightly rejected, but on the plus, you still danced with him the entire night =]|`|9dd1996d5fe2889ddece4c461db89465aa	I'm not sure I would want someone that tells me he likes someone else.  Who cares what he thinks about you when his eyes and/or heart are on someone else?  I believe that would keep me feeling insecure in the relationship.  I'm not even sure I would go to the prom with him if it were me.<br>  <br>  You might keep him as an online friend only...maybe.<br>  <br>  Yes, tell him your feelings.  He needs to know.|`|b899c97841937a827934c51503fafd2aaa	Sounds like he likes you as a friend and not as a girlfriend. Maybe he is more comfortable going to prom with you because he doesn't feel pressured into anything at prom. Maybe he is just too shy to talk to you face to face but finds it easy to talk to you on the net. Strike up a conversation with him at school and she how he acts that should let you know if he is interested OR if he isn't.|`|lY2jWW9xaa	He can answer all the questions better than anyone else can.|`|4277467a47333cb66646c3cf70b9f60daa	he probably likes you just wants to play the field.. if you want to land this fish you are going to dig your hooks in deeper.<br>  <br>  make it clear that you want some one and one.|`|5MSLnmpqaa	um maybe don't brake up because it is ok to like other people just don't brake down|`|78a2359ff90f71877274d643a1c55bd5aa	First off you should ask him what's up and see why he never speaks to you in school.

How you portray yourself, the way you are, what's within, is what makes you beautiful or ugly.  Whatever you are inside transfers to the outside.  Beauty comes from within and it is also in the eye of the beholder.
oRHpVtAiaa	You should get to know him better. Teach him english! That would surely get you guys closer. Guys dont know when girls are flirting with them and hinting that they like them, so try to tell him how you feel, after you get to know him better. Flirting is just a waste of time, although everyone including me does it anyway.|`|AA11831247	search for him online. it will be easier to talk to him that way. considering tons of people have myspace these days--i'd start searching. then talk to him a lot online, and it won't be as hard for you all to in person.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|1c6ff9c3254486b32b1a5fdf2f673698aa	just ask him. its the best that you can do!|`|832e2cd30c316eca3a9b252de4ba505daa	If you had curly hair??

Us curly-haired guys love the ladies, and I know that your friend would dig ya. Just be cool, and everything will be smooooooth....
6621aaded4120644526b187601ba44bdaa	If that is what she is like you are probably best off as just friends. It no doubt hurts, but at least you know now she is capable of doing that to you, but while you should NOT pipe dream, people do change. Some people, not all, have consciences. She may realise how wrong she was to dump you. My advice is to be friendly and nice, but find some other friends to hang out. Give yourself some space from her and show her that you don't need her. The more you hang around with her the longer it will hurt.<br>  <br>  Try finding some new friends or get back in touch with the ones you neglected because of her and remind them you have not forgotten them and still care about them.<br>  <br>  Remember the old adage "There are plenty of other fish in the sea". It may be hard to catch another one, but maybe you are better off without that one as your girl.<br>  <br>  You may see many happy couples around, but don't forget you may also unwittingly look upon and mix with many more people who like you broke up with their girls or worse got married and then divorced which I have heard is really painful.<br>  <br>  I won't say what you are going through is fun or nice, but it is also not the end of the World.<br>  <br>  Give that girl a break and give yourself time to recover and show her that she can't treat you like one of her perfume bottles that she picks up off the shelf, uses and then puts back when she has finished with it.<br>  <br>  You are a person with feelings just like her and you owe it to yourself to have a break to get over it and show her that she should be nice if she expects to have you around.<br>  <br>  Remember "absence makes the heart grow fonder" and you tend to value more what you have to work for.<br>  <br>  Let her work for your company and it might make her wake up to herself and the fact you deserve better treatment.<br>  <br>  You are a person not a perfume bottle. Let her know that!<br>  <br>  Don't be nasty or rude, but assert yourself and your rights and be dignified and don't let her treat you like crap.<br>  <br>  I'm not a shining success even though some have told me I look great and have brains to match, but I know that it really is better to be lonely than with a *****.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I regret dumping women and rejecting women who flirted at me because now I have no one, but when I reflect on my experiences and those of others and what those women I was close to and could have had were like I know I made the right choice even though I too reflect wistfully at times and wish I was blind most of the times I see couples in my line of sight.<br>  <br>  You don't need a girlfriend to be complete.<br>  <br>  Anyway, there will no doubt be others. Just take your time, keep your eyes open and ears pricked. Look and listen and check them out properly because as I have found rushed relationships rarely work out well.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Ian|`|wZZm1rfmaa	your wording speaks that "You still loves her"<br>  I will suggest ,you must talk her at least once or last.<br>  Sure... there after you will not be single anymore.<br>  Best of luck|`|d5be61356dacbd5dca6121235bdec47eaa	The only way you can move on is to move away from your present enviroment and explore another place in college or your neighbourhood. join a club, find a hobby and talk to people around you whom tou seldom converse with. <br>  A new world will open to you and you can find some new prespectives in life.|`|nImWypESaa	If I were you I would keep my distance from her, you have feelings for her still and it most likely hurts you to be near her without being with her.  I bet you that if you went your own way that she would come running back to you with open arms!  No matter what year it is the game is still on.  As far as your friends go, if they are good friends then I would talk to them about how you are feeling, if they don't understand then it is also time to find new ones.  It is so hard at your age, I truly feel for you; we all go through it and although it feels like you are alone, you aren't.  There are plenty of girls out there who would probably be with you, but since you are still hanging with your ex, they will not let you know; I know as a women I wouldn't approach you if I  saw you with her!  Ditch her and start over....  Good luck

Of course I'm going to explain: Someone romantic, chivalrious, sweet, affectionate, comforting... but at the same time, someone who shows himself masculine, strong, powerful, aggressive (of course, including herself).<br>  <br>  This way, she can feel safe in public and loved when together alone... which is what I think they ultimately want.|`|f7d968f201bbe6664670ce4eb45434d1aa	WELL I AM A WOMAN...AND WHAT I LOOK FOR IS SINCERITY, BEING HONEST WITH HOW YOU FEEL. BEING POLITE AND GENTLEMEN LIKE. BE MYSTERIOUS. LET THE GIRL CHASE YOU A LITTLE, DONT ALWAYS BE THE ONE RUNNING BEHIND HER. REMEMBER IMPORTANT DATES. TELL HER HOW SHE LOOKS, GIVE HER ADVISE. BE THE PROTECTOR BUT NOT POSSESSIVE. GIVE HER SPACE TO BREATH. LET HER KNOW THINGS. TELL HER YOUR SECRETS, IF YOU TRUST HER. DONT TALK MARRIAGE UNTIL SHE HAS SPOKEN OF IT FIRST.

Hope u get to knowwhat is making u shy..Is it what ppl will opinionate  ablout u the fact that makes u shy?? Is it ur lack of connection and trust on ppl that made u shy in the first place..All these are ALRIGHT reasons..Itscircumstances that shape us an dmake us who we are..Look for a guys who would cherish u for u not his prototype. If he was in ur place he would know that SHY is not just a word u could undo and become NOT SHY..Its alotof things that go on inside ur head. Hope u get what is good for u...whether it is being ur shy and sensitive self ...or someone who is outgoing and social..<br>  <br>  But take it form me...dont live inside urself coz it gets kindoflonely and dark inside.<br>  <br>  And do so comfortabily.. not as an imposition and u will see..itmight just work!<br>  Best of luk.|`|AA10408696	dont worry about it, if it is ment to be you wil be together|`|26557a15c021250c33a08e733801a9e2aa	he would just have to deal with it now..huh...im the same way .but my hubs dont mind it he likes me for me...not  other reason.|`|AA10567689	OK...I'm a total hypocrite for giving you advice because I'm really shy too, but I'm pretty good at giving advice to other people. I'll name a couple of the things that I do and didn't even notice until like, a week ago.<br>  <br>  1. eye contact- this is my main problem and I notice a lot of other people do it too. Make sure you actually look people in the eye(not creepy-like, but sincere) and not down at your shoes or into space. Avoiding eye contact tends to make people think you are lying to them.<br>  <br>  2. voice- When you are talking, make sure that you are actually loud enough for people to hear you. Face the people you are talking to. You will probably make even more friends when people realize what a great personality you have!<br>  <br>  3.posture- The last hint I want to give you is about posture. I don't know about you, but I am between average and tall in height. I tend to slouch because I really don't like having people look at me. If you do this, try wearing an outfit that you REALLY, REALLY like for a day. I do this occasionally, and I feel so confident  that I stand up straight. People always compliment my looks that day and I feel great! I'm sure you would too!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!!
f06af19abd8cdfe6154599c34cd418eeaa	thats really hard.. because they probably wont change.. they dont like the fact that you are trying to hang out with them and stuff.. this happened to my friend and they started making up rumors about her.|`|AO43wEHXaa	They're probably jealous.  I would either ignore them or confront your b/f about hanging out with the other women.  I'm not one to go flirting or hanging out with other women when I'm in a relationship.  I think it's good to have other sex friends, but not to the point to where they're coming between you and your relationship with the one you care about, especially if it's hurting the other person.|`|d1d9c591381f6009e917718d1f238f6eaa	Ignore them. Not everyone can get along in this world unfortunately.|`|334991c7fe3acbae4e6938ff712565faaa	You don't have to do anything however I will say that you may want to think about whether these women are really his friends. After all, if they are just friends then why would they respond to you like that? I have found that this type of reaction usually occurs when there is some kind of sexual history between them. Also it is your boyfriend's responsibility to check his friends & let them know to respect the relationship he's in currently... if he doesn't and you have told him how you feel (and use concrete examples like as soon as a dirty look is given... guys respond a lot better when they can see what you are talking about rather than thinking it's some mysterious "female thing" which is what they use to avoid actually dealing with the situation) then you have to decide whether the relationship is worth putting up with the behavior.|`|6X598ovyaa	Well...to be honest with you, the reason that his GIRL friends don't like you is because they are probably jealous.  If his guy friends don't like you then they probably think you are an idiot.

AA11305351	Be a man! Sit down and tell your wife the whole story, and be prepared to suffer the consequences. As far as the other woman goes, get prepared to take care of your responsibilities with the child she is carrying.|`|AA10824131	"Problems", what are "problems"? Everybody has problems. What matters most is how you solve/handle them. How mature are you? Are you the sort of person who runs away from problems? Do you look for the easy way out? Are you afraid of bearing up to your responsibilities? How do you know that when challenges come up in this new relationship you won't run off into someone else's arms?<br>  <br>  Honesty is the best policy all the way around. If it wasn't working and you have tried all possible ways then you should have let her know before - I know that that is water under the bridge - so let's move on. Step up to the plate and tell your wife. Be really apologetic (that means take all the blame) then ask for forgiveness. If she asks why tell her the truth. But before you do all of that you need to look in your heart and choose your hearts desire. Who do you want? Then stick to it.|`|eJLjN3quaa	I do not understand the point of cheating, I find it disgusting. If you were not happy with your wife why did'nt you just leave her. It would have hurt her less, now she has to find out that you have not only been sleeping with a woman, she is having your baby. I am sorry but I do not feel one bit sorry for you, you made your bed now you have to lay in it. It is time to step up and be a man, own up to everything, quit trying to hide it.|`|oOwX2WKvaa	People like you give me a headache.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Tell your wife the truth - see how she reacts and take it from there.|`|AA11943241	The first thing you need to do is to tell your wife about this affair and that this woman is pregnant with your child because of it. Your wife will then have to choose to either stay married to you or divorce you for what you have done. You have to face the music and do the right thing now that you have done it with her. I suggest you let this other woman go and when the baby is born be a dad to that child that you need to be and if need be have a paternity test done to confirm things as well. Do not run from the child but you should run to your wife and make your marriage work. Also seek marriage counseling if your wife still wants the marriage and is willing to give it another shot. Basically you chose to have the affair and now you have to pay the consequences. You will need to be involved in the babies life no matter what and your wife should not want you to not be. You will also have to pay child support as well.

'   she might just smile or laugh or maybe nod her head and ignore you, but just keep doing it.      thats what my bf use to do before we were going out, i had no clue he liked me and i just tried to ignore him cuz i thought he was weird.  but after all those small talks in which he insisted of, i got to know him more and didnt seem weird after all. <br>  <br>  so keep making small talk with her with random thing and see what she has to say about them, you'll learn more aboout her and she'll get to know you too.|`|ab6d1aaed7d89229fb58702c8e85ee18aa	you are just too tactful with your conversations... you need to relax and take a deep breath... and don't ask anymore questions because it wouldn't be a conversation anymore, just FAQ session. pick a common topic, be it movies, music or even news.|`|AA11425160	oh oh, talk about stuff that you both are involved in like school or sports or something, it keeps it up so that both of you arent talking all the time.|`|2n2olHFzaa	just comment on something she's doing, or if you know some of her interests ask her about them! this shows that you're interested in her life and hobbies|`|d1d9c591381f6009e917718d1f238f6eaa	Talk about random things.

If you are the same age, where are your parents in this?  Surely they would question their daughers behavior.  How about focusing on school, not defiance.  Good luck!
tFam9Ckcaa	it's probably wise to stay away and set some boundaries if you want to keep your existing relationship. the grass might not be greener on the other side my friend, and i wouldn't want you to loose the person you love over an infatuation. the thing is, after so many years, other people do seem more appealing (i know this from experience) it will be tough staying away as she is one of your close friends, but you have to ask yourself, is it worth it?|`|XYNNECqyaa	dont worry !! its just a crush.. ntn else.|`|f4c231a6e0293d940a2c4bf552f1c3f6aa	WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?  That you have no control!  Before you sleep with the other broad, be honest with your girlfriend.   Tell her, if your done with her and you want to move on, or get control and stay away from the other broad.

YES it will happen again because thats wat happend with us. i dnt think its a crush but more the excitement of something forbiden thats going on or maybe u just need a break from your gf. but seriously think where you want to stand with your gf because chances are you may go further with ur friend than intended and this will seriously crush ur gf if she finds out. if your scared that this will happen again keep ur distance when u are drunk or dont drink at all, that way u will have a clear mind and u will know what ur doing so that way if anything does happen again u'l know that it wasnt just the alcohol.<br>  <br>  good luck
d1d9c591381f6009e917718d1f238f6eaa	Look at his body language. Does he flirt with you? Tease you? Stare at you and then turn away when you catch him? Do you catch him smiling at you?<br>  <br>  As for him liking you more--there's not really a way to make someone fall in love with you. They either do, or don't. Just be yourself and if he does take an attraction to you, then good for you! If not, then I'm sure that you'll find Mr. Right out there who will love you for the person you are.|`|y5FfKGAsaa	just talk to him.<br>  you cant make someone like you.<br>  they have to develop that on their own.<br>  be yourself because you dont want him to fall for the wrong person.<br>  if you want to know if he likes you, talk to his friends or have your friends ask him.

5WzBHKAQaa	well, if this girl is worth it too you, you just gotta toughen up and get brave and take a risk by making the move to talk to her. the more you sit back and wait, the less anything is going to happen. its up to you to MAKE it happen! find something you guys have in common, or find a reason to talk to her and just man up and do it. you gotta give yourself the confidence you deserve.  next time shes alone, think of something you both are familiar with and bring it up in a conversation. you could also try getting her phone number and texting her, or talking to her online to start off with. you can do it just tell yourself you can!! good luck :)|`|3f917274983f820d68fcfe12ea1bae0caa	I'm the same age sooo heres what I have to say:<br>  1) Make friends with her. girl sometimes seem to like guys and not tend to show it.<br>  2) Talk about American Idol or find otu from a girl-friend what shows she likes<br>  3) Tell her straight up you think she's pretty, she'll take it as a compliment.

You need to get to know her. Play it cool, act casual and relaxed. A smile goes a long way, too.  Always acknowledge her presence with a smile or a nod- never just look past her in the hall. Don't come on too strong but don't act too disinterested. Say hi to her after about a week, and then just keep instigating more and more conversation as the days go by. Go with your instinct. If it's right, then you guyz will click.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|REMguHpuaa	Well i think your situation is that u r shy to ask out someone who u like, but isn't your type.......maybe u should invite her to the movies, but tell her she is just a friend.

You do have a reason to belive that your boyfriend is having sex behind you back, then should you really be going out with him to begin with??  And also, i think you are being sort of controlling by saying that your BF can't see this girl anymore.  That probably gives him the empression that you don't trust him.

2eT7T2fKaa	Ok, obviously many people have already said that it isn't sexual. And I agree with the previous answer for the most part. It is an expression that you don't worry much about what is the truth but what matters is what he/she thinks - can be in a good way or bad way. <br>  <br>  Good way: you don't think you're *very* good looking. she says so. So, you can have a conversation with your friend and you can tell him, "i know it sounds crazy but that's what SHE said".<br>  <br>  Bad way: you think your gf is attracted to another man. she says he is just a friend. So, you can have a conversation with your friend, expressing your concern, but you will say "well, looks like she is attracted to him, but if i ask her, that's what she says".<br>  <br>  well, my examples aren't that good, but I hope you get the point. It is about you simply accepting the fact that that's what someone says (may be believes in the same) irrespective of whether you believe/agree with it or not (often you don't agree/believe in what he/she said).|`|77a7f5bfedc6483d38df02440f1748cdaa	I didn't know that was a sexual phrase.|`|t03VDOkjaa	that's not a sexual phrase.. <br>  <br>  that's what he/she said <br>  <br>  is simply what it says.. there are no subliminal messages there.. sorry to disappoint you..|`|BR56bqrdaa	Someone might say, "That was really hard," when they're talking about something that was difficult.

8cd5f72d1b072964d9d14519dd841c44aa	All these answers are right, but if you have someone in your life who is constantly trying to get your love... something someones doing is giving that person the perception that theres something lacking.  Can be a mixture of things.  "they" are insecure for some reason. Could be a bad relationship, could be their parents.. but bottomline that person has a insecure problem.  Maybe you both havent reached a level where you have a deeper bond to not worry.  Especially in women I think its completely normal.  Esp if shes very sensitive of such.  Best way to stop the way you feel is talk.  And try to understand the other person.  Bc from experience this might be the one thing "they" need to get past the insecure part.  So instead of responding like, " i feel your smothering me with your demand to constantly knowing i love you..."  Maybe just saying, "You dont have to worry if i love you, I love you" and compliment them.  such as i love you more than anything and couldnt bare it if you were out of my life, and i prob dont show you enuf how important you are but if you werent here id be crushed... something or the other.. <br>  <br>  just listen and communicate !:)|`|98oqDvCUaa	I don't think a person has to prove their love when they are with the right individual <br>  <br>  -----it's only when you're not with the right person that you have to constantly prove your love for them|`|AA11604319	True love is not proven, it's known.|`|75SR4iDdaa	People who are constantly having to prove their love aren't being loved back in the same way.

Start with coffee and go from there.|`|0FpaEkUXaa	I don't think it will.  i didn't want to ate my best friend that was a guy because i was scared we wouldn't be friends if we broke up but we never did and were not even good friends like i was scared would happen. if you end up not being friends then it was going to happen sooner or later so go for it|`|iyGzYfhHaa	yes because, i dated my guy friend, and we broke up and things werent the same anymore and we slowy drifted apart and it hurts so much loosing that friend since we were good friends in the first place. and dating each other killed everything.|`|d1d9c591381f6009e917718d1f238f6eaa	It would only change your relationship.
QaaaRYZWaa	One has rejected you and now wants to be with you?  But now someone who has really sparked your interest has come along, Great!! Give him a try!!  Out of curiosity, did the first guy have a girlfriend during this time and break up with her and is using you as a fallback? If so, don't be his doormat.<br>  My opinion is out with the old and in with the new!!|`|6546665755ed14d9ee3307f3abeb1c35aa	which guy do you want more?|`|3fb3576ae4de098edc9853c7655b732faa	whichever one feels right to you.|`|72d9de10a2ab1169978957e193ac7e9eaa	Which guy makes you feel better? That is the one who will be better for you.  Never settle for good, go for great. Everyone deserves happiness :)|`|wLIhMNZjaa	Ask yourself, which is more important, being good friends or being bf/gf? Don't let a rejection hurt you. Trust yourself. It's not something we can answer for you. <br>  <br>  Who treats you better? Would dating your friend ruin the friendship?<br>  <br>  Good luck!
