OK.. following the collapse of the twin towers another building known as tower 7 suddenly collapsed. it had minimal damage at the time so when asked on a Foxtel interview about it .. the owner was quaoted as saying : "yeah- we had ot pull it" .. in other words they rigged it with explosives and blew its key supports so it would fall into a tight nice mess.. as it did..       So how on Earth did Silverstein rig a tower with explosives, then detonate it.. during a disaster, while the place was a shamble.. and with only hours to work with ???       can anyone identify what technology allows a building ot be rigged and felled in a matter of hours ??       coz all other demolitions have taken weeks and monhs at the very least.. Silverstein managed to rigg up and pull tower 7 in a matter of hours.       please help.. i think this technology used by silverstein should be exposed so the rest of the planet may use it too..       thanks

20090307113327AAZO6my	News & Events;Current Events	Is the President of Syria Considered as a Good Dictator or a Bad?	This is what I am concluding so far from surveys in my area (Ann Arbor Michigan).      Some people are aware that their government is a dictatorship, Bashar is generally considered to be a good dictator capable of standing up to the West and keeping Islamic extremists in line. Bashar genuinely wishes to better Syria and the Syrian people understand and appreciate that, offering him their support. They don't consider him a deity, but he's far from hated. Generally, he is respected and loved.
20090307121045AAjOuaC	News & Events;Current Events	Why do people assume that countries have to loan the US money?	Here is my opinion on the matter after much research and learning about the situation, please read it before answering the question:      The US is the consumer of the global economy, in other words we are in the back not the driving force of this global economy, and unfortunately, we don't produce and manufacture much anymore. Other countries produce much more then the US, especially in Asia and those products are used to stock our stores in the US.      The US borrows a great deal of money from countries through the sale of Treasury Bonds and with that money consumes products from the same countries that it borrowed money from.      There is no real way to pay back those countries for the loans other then by printing money since that money never went to creating anything to export.      How does it continue to benefit the rest of the world to keep this pattern going?      BTW: I am pleased it is continuing for now because if it stopped it would be disastrous for tens of millions of people in the US and since I live in the US, I wouldn't like the consequences of what would happen, but, I don't believe it is sustainable and eventually this system will come to an end and the problems will be that much worse especially due to the amount of new money being put into the system to solve the problems and the inflation that it will create.

What does North Korea and Iran hope to achieve from creating nukes? Nothing will change except that they'll be able to threaten their enemies without nukes but then their enemies without nukes (Israel, S Korea etc) are allies with the USA so any attempt to destroy them would get themselves destroyed. Only Russia and China have any chance of fighting back against The West if a nuclear war erupts and even then they would lose most.

In some european countries, people get prosecuted for even attempting to study or question it - its a 'crime'      Freedom of speech is the bedrock of democracy.    So why is it against laws to question it or deny it?      JUST TO HIGHLIGHT my view - I BELIEVE THE HOLOCAUST HAPPENED.
