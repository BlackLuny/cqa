As far as the GTR comment goes, my best friend has a 2008 Charger SRT8 with Vortech supercharger running 5psi of boost and has had no problem beating the GTR's in freeway runs. Cost a lot less too seeing as the car was new for $40k and $3k for the supercharger.

They are always looking for a warm dry place to procreate.|`|ZBVMT11maa	Ive had a lizard get into a past car we had. but field mice can come from anywhere, no matter where you live they can travel in anything.     While your car is sitting they could have crawled up into the car engine compartment to be warm, maybe  found a way through the back air passage behind the rear bumper.      Maybe in something that you purchased a bag etc.|`|AA10498232	Buy some moth balls and place on the flat surfaces under the hood and if you park inside put a few on the floor directly under where you park.

sCqdisvnaa	You can do it, but it's expensive: $2,795.    Take a look here:    http://www.bimmernav.com/store/catalog/b...

However, many people will tell you the SAME thing, it wasnt too smart to cheap yourself, and spend a grand more than he was offering. maybe there was something wrong with it, thats not visible, and he didnt tell you about it.  I.E. Even a minor "fender bender" in the past could screw up the frame and cause another issue down the road.

Do not ever bargain for the price of a car without your OWN printouts of KBB and NADA suggested retain prices.    Good chance you got taken.|`|AA11914369	I strongly suspect this is not a legitimate question, but I will answer nonetheless.    If something is priced at a certain amount, that is the maximum you should consider, especially when it comes to automobiles or other things that are negotiable.    To offer and pay more than the asking price is absolutely ridiculous and unheard of.  No, I don't think you did the right thing.  I think you threw away at least $1,000.|`|gzaVGE4Qaa	$9 seems like a reasonable price for a car. You are an honorable man for realizing the dealer's mistake and correcting his gross error.|`|k4DxnbMCaa	Ehh... I don't think that it was necessary. Car salesmen are already pretty cheap, and many (not all) are already overpricing their cars. Being generous is a great thing, and I believe that you did do the right thing to a certain extent. The car salesman may have a family to support, and if you want to help him out, by all means go ahead. However, there are jobless, homeless, and needy people out there that may have put it to better use.    Anyhow, don't fret over it too much. There's not much else you can do now, as you can't go back to the car dealership and demand your $1000 back.|`|ojxfzv7Faa	Trying to understand what you did or what you just said gives me a headache.
TdrgZwnoaa	What do you need that for. Your car already has it. It is called clear coat and it is applied when they paint the car at the factory. The dealer is ripping you $1500.00 or a glorified wax job. Lexus dealers do it for $300-$390 which means you can probably do it yourself for about $ 50.00     And if it is so good, why do you have to reapply it every six months. Any good quality car wax does exactly the same job.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	i don't really think you need it. they just want you to pay more.    plus, mercedes paint usually lasts very long...my friend has a mercedes from the 80's with still perfect paint.
PRx6j6YQaa	and it cost them $100 what a rip off your cars paint has all the protection its ever going to need from the factory|`|5193f1efcd6be58503e419f249203831aa	Auto Armor is good stuff but $1500 is way too much for it.  Paint protection alone should be about 1/3 of that.  Go to a detail shop or dealership that is NOT a Benz dealer.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	This is how dealerships really make money...the aftermarket add-on's such as paint protection, rust proofing, etc.    Check around and you'll find the same service offered much cheaper elsewhere.|`|mCbhjcLuaa	Don't do it, it is a scam as you have suspected.|`|gPhNTjTWaa	Any paint protection purchased at the dealer is designed for just one thing: PROFIT!  Don't buy any of this "protection".  Also, don't believe everyone that says your paint is okay the way it is from the factory- they are wrong too!  The paint MB uses today is poorly designed due to it being water based.  While this is great for our environment, it's not so great for lasting as long as your car will (mechanically speaking).  Several factors can ruin your paint.  Acid rain, bird droppings, tar, salt, etc. all will damage the paint over time.    Try going here:  http://www.griotsgarage.com  and check out their products.  Especially their one step paint sealant.  I use it on my show cars 3 times every year and the stuff works- and WELL!  You'll save $1500 and know that your paint is protected by doing it yourself.  Also, NO paint protection will last YEARS!  This is all BS!  You should seal your paint as conditions determine.  Either once a year (minimum) or up to 10 times if you live next to a coal plant in Jersey.  Makes sense doesn't it?    Hope this has informed you and enjoy your new Benz!
AA11914369	No.  You shouldn't either.  Most cases of someone selling a car from another coountry and using __________ as escrow holder, I deliver, you can return it if you don't like it and get a refund--are scams designed to get your cash.
aFL2DNyWaa	It is legal for the towing company to do this, and by law they can go after the owner of the car for all fees.  If the vehicle was not insured you ARE liable for all the charges.  You should check your states vehicle code law for specifics.  In Illinois you would be liable for the price of the tow and maximum of 30 days of storage, plus any collections costs.  Illinois will even suspend you drivers license, but I've never heard of any company going that far    What state do you live in?|`|bW931jBaaa	If they found it and towed it, you are responsible for the fees as the registered owner. So, yes they can.  Was it insured when it was torched? If so, did your insurance pay for the vehicle? If they did, the insurance company would have had you sign a release of interest to the vehicle which would now make it their problem, not yours.

HOPE THIS HELPS YOU. BUT DO TRY YOUR LOCAL LOCKSMITH THEY ARE LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THE DEALER.|`|NFK3A68oaa	Kmart or Walmart will probably be able to make you one for a couple of dollars.  The dealer or a locksmith can, too, but will cost more.    If they can't they will tell you.    You are smart to keep an extra key.  I keep one around my neck.  The first time I closed the door with the key still in the ignition, I was VERY happy I had mine.      Best regards,  Michael
zEVpA4WCaa	Sounds like the transceiver that picks up the pats code from the key is going bad .Ford uses a p.a.t.s. system on there cars and trucks this is the theft deterrent system and they go bad on fords which will cause the no start problem and the radio not to work.I own a lock and key biz and we do repairs on these all the time .The part will run you about 48.00 and take about 30 min to change.|`|TqPpsGqvaa	Sounds like you have two problems.

Lbulud8raa	Comfort and interior detail and style: Audi is often considered the world benchmark here.  They are reliable but servicing costs are high.  Safety is excellent    The Volvo alternatives are a bit more stylish than the Accord but they are not built like they used to be. Electrical gremlins are common as they get older.  Safety is first class.  Servicing costs are not as high as for an Audi.    The Accord probably the easiest to live with in terms of reliability and depreciation.  Servicing costs will probably be in the same league as the Volvo.  Comfort in the bigger US Accord (as opposed to the international Accord Euro which is a different car), will be a plus too, and it will ride accourding to American tastes: and still handle sort of okay.  The Audi will be firm by US tastes and handle brilliantly.  The Vilvo will have US spec suspension,which is softer than that found elsewhwere- it is not as tidy a handler as the Audi.|`|7b2RJq47aa	Volvo might be a little more reliable, but the A6 in my opinion is way nicer.  A6 is really safe and very comfortable.|`|j3f8m6REaa	No, but any Euro sedan will be much less reliable than the Accord. They may be sexy and beautiful but European cars are hurtling down the unreliable/too expensive to maintain/second mortgage to repair whirlpool at a horrifying rate. Even a lowly Chevy Malibu will go over 150,000 miles with only basic maintenance.
a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	That depends on what one is trying to accomplish.    For powering out of a corner, particularly a slow one there is no substitute for good low-end torque.  For top speed at the end of the straight though you need horsepower.|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	build an engine for more torque and you will be a lot happier.|`|bW931jBaaa	I like bottom end torque! How often are you able to use all the top end horsepower. I built a 420 hp 550 ft lb torque small block chevy for my 55 wagon and I am happy with the low end grunt. I dont plan on taking that car over 120 so why would it need more horsepower.|`|AA11647772	that's about a 50-50 item there   it really depends on what your needs are if you live in a place with lots of hills  or mountains  i would go for torque  or i lived in the city  or open country flat lands i would go for the horse power|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	In a nut shell, torque is the twisting force and horsepower is a measurement of how quickly you can apply the torque over a given distance.  Horse power and torque are directly related,   horsepower = torque * rpm / 5252   Which is better? Well, torque is what we feel in the seat of our pants and the rate of a vehicle's acceleration mimics the engine's torque curve while the total horsepower is dependent on RPM's. So I'd have to say that torque has a slight edge - but only a very slight edge.
AA11823124	Glow plugs, glow plug relay, air leaks, low fuel pressure, plugged fuel filter, leaking injector pump seals, low compression. You need to test and eliminate every one of these factors.  Hoping is not the route to take, because you end up spending money and time replacing unnecessary parts. Test per manufacturer's specs and replace as needed. Buy that manual and get a grip.

Or a city law in your area post on the property?  Do you have anything signed by the property owner to tow the vehicle.  It had a flat tire be ford you hooked up to it. Did property owner see the flat tire?   Call your insurance company. Give them all the Information.  Before the tire is done away with. It can prove how it blowout. It can work for you or against you.  That what you pay the insurance company for. Your going to run into a lot of asses out on the road. II used to drive tow vehicle.

Make your arrangements now as this is awards season, followed almost immediately by prom/grad ceremonies and limos are at a premium. Specify exactly what you want and for how long and get a written quote on company letterhead.    All the best.
dPLkNRNuaa	Call the title loan place. Make sure they have the title on site.    When you sell the car. Have the purchaser meet you at the title loan place. The purchaser pays the title loan people (cash or certified funds). If the sells price of the car is less than you owe - you will need to pay the difference. Since the loan is paid, the title loan people will release their lien on the title and give it to you and the purchaser. You then sign the back of the title and give it to the purchaser. Have the purchaser give you a bill of sale - so you have a record the car was sold.|`|AA11914369	You can't sell what isn't yours.  If you have a title loan, you have given the title to a lender in exchange for some money.  Pay off the loan, get your title back, and then the car is yours to sell.|`|bW931jBaaa	HUH?|`|16vMIGPiaa	You don't "salvage" your title.  If you put your car up for sale, the title loan company must be paid off first because they're holding the title.  The only way the new owner can get the title is if the loan company is paid and they release it.  So that means you have to either sell the car for at least as much as you've borrowed against it, or show up with cash to pay of the difference.
1OmSZUvLaa	It really depends on the city that your renting in and rates can vary from company to company.  I would suggest going to a car rental booking site, like travelocity, to compare multiple car rental company rates for the city and dates you're looking for.  Once you find the cheapest company, you can try going to their website directly to see if they have any deals or e-coupons for monthly specials.  Right now, Budget and National are offering $50 off a one- month rental.  You can also try check monthly rates using a car rental discount code, if you qualify.  There are hundreds of membership programs and professional associations that offer car rental discount codes to their members.  You can find a list of car rental discount codes for 8 major car rental companies, at http://www.best-car-rental-tips.com/disc...    Hope this helps and good luck!|`|8eIFHbogaa	you should use a coupon code before you rent your car. check http://www.rentalcarscode.com/|`|D6kZzXQeaa	Do your research before reserving from a company but I would have to just give you a guess of around 150 a week with tax.

AA11914369	Richardsons Patent Changes Everything  On June 18, 1889, a man named William H. Richardson walked into a Baltimore patent office with an idea that forever changed the baby carriage.    His idea was for a baby carriage that used a special joint to allow a bassinet to be turned to face the operator or face away as in conventional prams of the day. In essence, he created the first reversible baby carriage.    Several changes he made also went into the axles, which allowed for greater turning ability. Up until that time, baby carriages had solid axels that did not allow for independent wheel movement. The front wheels turned together, and the back wheels turned together. Richardsons carriage allowed for the wheels to turn individuallywhich meant that the vehicle could turn 360 degrees in a much smaller turning radius.    Many of Richardsons design modifications are still in use today.    So, there has been little change since the patent went into effect.  See http://www.thehistoryof.net/history-of-s... for more.
p5azo6niaa	its not good for the car. especially the small and weak clutches on air cooled VW's, but here's how you can show off for your friends once a month unless you want to buy a new clutch and tires every year.    with your Ghia stopped(on a level surface), put it in first gear. give it WAY more gas then you would when you accelerate from a stop normally and let the clutch out rather slowly. that should do it. it helps with a ghia or bug if you are on a bit of gravel because the engines were not built for this kind of driving.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	You need a modified 1600 motor with a racing clutch, to do that.|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...you'll ruin the clutch...   just enjoy the ride or find an icy road and skid around a bit.|`|9WvqA5zDaa	what you are thinking of is aline lock for front brakes. that wont even work unless you have a lot  of power from the motor|`|1b3ab1f5bfb9839f6af7c79693195feeaa	LOLOLOLOLOLOL....burn it!|`|pvabglXhaa	oh how cruel you are to treat such a beautiful car this way!

gFHTcIc8aa	I am assuming you have checked power steering housing/seals for leaks and fluid level is ok AND length and cog of replacement belts is dimensionally correct.    If you have changed several belts and there is still squeaking, it is good to isolate exactly which belt(s) are causing you trouble.  If the engine and its aux components (Alternator, Power Steering) have alot of miles, bearing wear could be contributing to problem (check alternator by rotating pulley by hand and see if it rotates rough), but more than likely source of problem could be a bent pulley shaft. This can occur with overtensioning of belts or belts that are too small and forced onto pulley.  Excessive load placed on the pulley will cause shaft bending. This will cause shaft to rotate eccentrically.  So when you place a new OEM belt on a pulley with a bent shaft, the pulley will not rotate in true circle (eccentric).  Belt will become loose at the high point of rotation, producing squealing.    If you have a way of testing a new alternator and/or power steering unit you may want to replace, and test.  This is labor intensive and I would do this as a last resort.    Belt dressing (spray) rarely works and will only make a minor, temporary correction.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	I would use only OE belts.|`|2TEDmxPXaa	Its hard to say what it is when it cant be seen or heard here, but keep in mind that theres more then one belt under the hood and it might not be the same one.    But there are many cases where a belt slightly shorter than OE listed needs to be installed & thats had the squeel gone afterwards. And maybe check further for one stiff pulley that takes a bit to get up to speed...and tensioner should be checked too maybe, that can create an annoying squeal.|`|AA11647772	check for belt tightness.. there should be no more that a half inch play in it ( push down on belt and see how it goes down) possibility  is your friend put on the wrong type of belt      one thing that might help is go to your local auto part store and ask for their advice   and   you can either buy a repair manual for you car for how to do it your self  or they might be able to print you up a copy of instructions  on how to do it also|`|2cbe1bba8389a009e6f7e731cb983e90aa	Usually incorrect tension, some are manually adjusted and some are self tensioners , but even self tensioners fail and do not keep belt tight. rarely Ive seen belts squeak because of incorrect pulley alignment(usually after a altenator, waterpump, powersteering pump was incorrectly installed) or belt contamination( small leak on belt or even some sprays meant to quiet belt can cause noise, never spray belt)|`|NFK3A68oaa	At many auto parts stores you can buy a Haynes do-it-yourself manual for your model car, with step-by-step instructions, and basic explanations at the beginning of each chapter. If it is not in stock, you can order it on line by searching on "auto repair manuals" on Yahoo search. In the front is a section on "Troubleshooting" that guides you step-by-step to find causes of most engine malfunctions based on the car's symptoms. Whether you do the work yourself or not, it helps you make informed decisions and not be taken advantage of, and to not feel so "in the dark."    Squealing belts are always caused by the same thing as far as I know, and that is being too loose.  1/2" of play sounds too loose to me.  The usual test is to find the two pulleys that are the farthest apart (and that you can still reach) and push hard with your thumb in the middle of that stretch of belt.  There should be no more than 1/4" inch of play, or whatever the manual for your car says.  If it says use a belt gauge or just gives you a measurement in pounds, you'll need to take it to a garage, ASK THEM if they have a belt gauge to check the tightness of your belt, and let them do it.    If the belt is too tight, it will wear out the alternator bearings.  If it is too loose, it will not be able to get enough grip on the pulleys to turn them and will slip, squealing.
gPhNTjTWaa	I wouldn't do it through the first aid kit.  Take out the back seat, then the rear parcel shelf (which holds the first aid kit) and you'll notice that the chassis has many holes of which to port a tube.  Choose the appropriate one and cut into the parcel shelf.  You may want to dampen the shelf with acoustic treatment like Dynamat before finishing.  Also, take out the first aid kit and dampen the enclosure.  Otherwise it will rattle and buzz- drives me crazy when people take short cuts on acoustic treatment.  Also, don't listen to the bozo that said why would you do such a thing to a fine auto.  They obviously believe that the junky Becker system with a cassette tape is a GREAT system.  Couldn't be further from the truth.  Those systems are junk and MB should be embarrassed by such trash in their cars.  Hope this info helps.

FgRUdQOBaa	No, train operations have absolutely NO effect on automobiles, none whatsoever.   In fact there are vehicles called "hy rails" that have special wheels that allow them to run on the track or the highway, and they never have problems.     Until they are in a position to be hit by an approaching train, in which case as the car becomes airborne the engine may very well shut off.|`|mKVFIklaaa	What on earth is this question?|`|g7M1DxFCaa	That would be lethal, it'd mean lots of cars would just stop on level crossings.  Why would anybody design a car like that unless they just wanted to kill people?  Colonel Dekker, if a train could generate an electromagnetic pulse strong enough to stop nearby vehicles from working it'd also disrupt it's own control systems, so it wouldn't work either.|`|g3U8788Zaa	Yes its because of the new technology which is built into the barriers.Basically what happens is  there is a magic eye built into the barriers which records the distance you are from the barriers.If you are to close it sends a beam out to your engine which immobilises it.Once the barriers are ready to lift it does the opposite and sends a beam to start your engine.This has been introduced to stop idiots weaving in and out of the barriers trying to beat the trains.Hope this clarifys the situation.LOL.|`|AA10164889	If you wait a long time for a train to pass at a grade crossing, and your car is not properly maintained, it might overheat or start to run very rough.  That might cause it to "shut down."  That's the only connection I can think of that remotely answers your question.    There is no technical connection between the railroad crossing and your car's engine.  Several of the answers above are not true, and are just making fun of you.  Shame on them, I suppose.|`|23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	Sorry, this question doesn't make any sense.    If you are thinking that there is something about electric railways that will affect a car engine's electronics or engine management system, then the answer is NO. There is no "radiation" from an overhead wire or third rail that will do it.    Apart from that I can only assume that if you sit at a level crossing long enough then you'll eventually run of petrol. That will stop it.|`|t4FBtIsTaa	This question makes no sense!|`|SsEOTFLRaa	hi i get your question basically are u asking if the car engines shut off when we are near the railway and the barriers are down i have never heard that i know ppl switch of their engines while wating but never heard of that sorry i think some 1 pulling ur leg|`|rnVdxXotaa	Yes the reason it happens is because as a car goes near a railway station its train alarm system activates in case the car gets too close to a train, it's more of a precaution system that stops the engine so you don't get hit by the train.|`|54ef14aee629dde270e28b8db2534f5daa	absolutely,,,the engine also cuts out(along with the lights and all electricals when a UFO flies overhead)course it helps if u stall it,,  B*LLsh*t|`|IotJ5Y5waa	In theory the Electromagnetic Radiation from the "live " power rail could if it were powerful enough disrupt [the [electrons?] magnetic pulses ] in the ignition [system] coil on your car and stop the spark from igniting the petrol - thus engine shutdown. It would have to be alternating current { AC} like the mains in the house. But I think the power rail is direct current { DC } like the car battery. Confused ?. The Electromagnetic  Radiation would have to be extremely high. The only thing [that i know of] capable of producing this much[concentrated] energy [to stop a engine is: 1) Atomic bomb  2) The Anti - Gravity propulsion system that UFOs use: this is because they use huge amounts of Electromagnetism to produce - Inverse Anti Gravity waves.

AA10906914	Off topic:    Please email me and explain just how under powering a sub causes damage - sparky3489@yahoo.com    ______________________________    First you must know that under powering is just too little power. This in no way can harm a speakers as it's no different than having the volume down.    Having the gain (or level control) maxed out and incorrectly set is the ONLY thing that will cause an under powered sub to be damaged. This would cause clipping which is really OVER POWERING, not under powering.    Clipping is asking the amp to push power beyond it's limits for those that don't know.    As always, see my site for more info http://spkrbox1.spaces.live.com Pay especially close attention to the link in the middle of the page.     Your equipment will thank you.    Some more unknown truths:     I can drive speakers with a 100% clipped square wave signal all day long with no problems as long as the thermal and mechanical limits of the speaker are not exceeded.     I can feed a speaker 100% distortion all day long with no damage as long as the thermal and mechanical limits of the speaker are not exceeded.     I can exceed the thermal and/or mechanical limits of a speaker and watch it fail in short order.    These are electrical and physical truths and anything else is a myth.    I will add these two sites to back up my claim:    http://www.bcae1.com/2ltlpwr.htm    http://www.rockfordfosgate.com/scripts/r...    The later is from Rockford Fosgate and has a lot of good info on the matter - they don't even mention under powering as an issue.

The air trapped inside a subwoofer box helps control the motion of the cone.  As the cone moves in or out, the changing air pressure inside the box resists the motion of the sub.  The further the cone moves from its rest position, the greater the air pressure forcing it back to center.    Subwoofer manufacturers are counting on this air pressure when they apply a power rating to the sub.  If you use a larger box than recommended, the air pressure keeping the sub under control will be lessened.  If you don't use a box at all, then applying too much power to the sub might force it past its mechanical limitations, causing damage to the suspension.    If you're using a ported box, then bass notes below the port frequency will cause the sub to react as if it's not in a box at all.  That's why subs in ported boxes should be used with subsonic filters, to keep the lowest frequencies from reaching the subwoofer.   Sealed boxes don't have this weakness.    Some subs are designed for free air use.  They tend to have a stronger, stiffer suspension, so they don't require the trapped air to damp the cone movement.  However, the stiffer suspension means they don't allow as much excursion and usually won't play as deep bass as a sub in an enclosure.      As for under-powering, it doesn't damage subwoofers in any way.  If your amplifier/subwoofer combination gives you the volume you want, without producing serious distortion, then it doesn't matter if the amp power rating isn't as high as the sub's power rating.|`|L0H4iVHWaa	well    you should only free-air a subwoofer if it is a free-air sub... and NO underpower a subwoofer CAN NOT damage your sub at all what so ever, nothing internal damages at all.. first guy has no idea what hes talking about    and the second guy.. is basically completly right|`|AA10906914	FREE AIR SUB:    Most subs requires a box to provide pressure to keep the sub from going into excursion (exceeding the mechanical limits).    A free air sub is designed to handle this but won't have the same response as a sub in an enclosure.    ___________________________    UNDERPOWERING:    First you must know that under powering is just too little power. This in no way can harm a speakers as it's no different than having the volume down.    Having the gain (or level control) maxed out and incorrectly set is the ONLY thing that will cause an under powered sub to be damaged. This would cause clipping which is really OVER POWERING, not under powering.    Clipping is asking the amp to push power beyond it's limits for those that don't know.    As always, see my site for more info http://spkrbox1.spaces.live.com Pay especially close attention to the link in the middle of the page.     Your equipment will thank you.    Some more unknown truths:     I can drive speakers with a 100% clipped square wave signal all day long with no problems as long as the thermal and mechanical limits of the speaker are not exceeded.     I can feed a speaker 100% distortion all day long with no damage as long as the thermal and mechanical limits of the speaker are not exceeded.     I can exceed the thermal and/or mechanical limits of a speaker and watch it fail in short order.    These are electrical and physical truths and anything else is a myth.    I will add these two sites to back up my claim:    http://www.bcae1.com/2ltlpwr.htm    http://www.rockfordfosgate.com/scripts/r...    The later is from Rockford Fosgate and has a lot of good info on the matter - they don't even mention under powering as an issue.    This is what clipping looks like - http://i81.photobucket.com/albums/j230/s...

If they cannot or if you feel an error has been made then you sue (not sew) the other party in court and a judge will determine liability.|`|w5BjzqH1aa	Find a good law er to go to court and put it off till he can look in to it.

The police do sometimes make decisions on who is at fault on the report, but the insurance company uses this only as a "tool" to   verify info;    ie;  vehicle, drivers, passengers, location of accident, time of day etc.      the insurance company will decide fault based on all info from the driver statements, police report, witnesses etc.      My suggestion is have your mother taken for "professional help" and not let her drive.      Also, i suggest talking to a lawyer for her legal rights or to a legal aide if you cannot afford a lawyer.      I know you want to help, but you only have "her side", which maybe what she believes or wants to believe.    call your insurance company and ask for their help or suggestions.    good luck.|`|wCIHZ8MRaa	school bus is at fault. that's some bullsh** I'm sorry I hope things go well for her|`|rSMXkrBeaa	D:  thats ******* stupid, your mom should win!!    noone can make her go to court....        was anyone in the car there with her? as a witness?|`|43769776f4128a4bec47a0e8a7748039aa	Actually if the school bus slammed into your mom.

As far as the policeman who hit your mom and they are trying to ignore her and say it wa all her blame. The police think they are Above The Law. And think they can get away with any crime they can.. unless there is to many people or cam recorders who prove they are guilty in the crime they did. Just remember.. one thing. The judges and the other police force think they are right because they are police. And they are automatically right.. right or wrong. The police today make me sick.

3cFKfFifaa	Exhaust, headers, pcm, throttle body, cold air intake, intake manifold, heads, cam, boost, nitrous. Generally best in that order.    Easiest to do is the exhaust, intake and a reflashed PCM. For the exhaust, you can bring it to any exhaust shop and have them custom weld up some 2.5" pipe and high flowing muffler. For the intake, you can buy a cold air intake www.mpracing.org. As for the PCM, you can get a reflashed one from mpracing as well. Don't try and use any "chip" you can find on ebay etc, as they don't do anything. Getting your PCM reflashed will allow you to adjust air/fuel ratios, shift points, shift firmness, etc.|`|vHB9zUcCaa	have u ever thought of trying a higher octane gas?? some 1 recommended i try that 2 clean the engine & it worked. i immediately noticed faster take-off & it runs better.|`|5kVyZyGGaa	cold air intake  exhaust  cams  port and polish  and if you have the money turbo/supercharger|`|iI2xDvw4aa	Honestly, trade it in on a GTO|`|y93R1Na1aa	If you have the technical ability, then you should swap in a 3.8L V6, preferably a Gen II supercharged engine (L67 is the RPO). There are websites that will show you pictures, and forums to ask questions on. If you have a manual trans, it can supposedly hold up to the 240HP of the L67. You just have to work on the flywheel, motor mounts, and get an aftermarket ECM because of the OBD2 requirements of the stock ECM.    Otherwise, I wouldn't do much more than your basic bolt ons. The 3400 tends to burn oil, and is not nearly as robust as its 2.8L, 3.1L and 3100 cousins.    Just because I wouldn't do it, doesn't mean that some one else hasn't. If you hunt around you'll see claims of 350HP turbocharged 3400s running around.    Good Luck!|`|vfmLGLd9aa	Short of doing an engine build there are a few things you can do to enhance the performance of your anemic V-6.  First of all you an go to Summit racing and see if they have available a performance chip for the computer..it is a quick and easy mod that enhances ignition timing and fuel delivery to spike it to give the extra snap off the line you want, also some higher revving charcteristics.  Also K&N makes a free breathing air cleaner for it and will also help.  I suggest using a synthetic oil, and do a fuel injection cleaning service...dirty injectors on that or any engine can hinder performance.  There isn't much else short of major mods...you might consider Nitrous for a quick and occasional slam you in the seat blast at the push of a button..but keep in mind,.that may shorten the life span of your engine and can even cause some major damage if used incorrectly.  You can also get higher performing fuel injectors and Mass Air Flow sensor for that model that will give you some more HP.  Check Summit racing on line and also Jegs,..they both carry some performance stuff for all those engines...you may have to call them,..sometimes they don't list not so popular pieces in the catalogue, but have them in stock on if you ask them.
5uFUemnKaa	My sister had this problem with her car and the antifreeze levels were low.  Once she added more the problem was solved.|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	The newer cars are using a very small radiator as far as capacity goes. The heater tubes are set up so that if the fluid level goes low they are not getting the full flow. The radiator gets the majority to protect the engine. So the fluid level is low in the reservoir.  Do not open it hot as even if the fluid is low the steam will still be there. FIll it up right to the very top and then fill the overflow reservoir to the cold level line with more antifreeze if the engine is cold. The radiator actually uses the overflow container as the reservoir now.
HpwyYmoIaa	Turbo is all around better, it will have some turbo lag but the amount of power after the lag more then makes up for it, and with turbos you can up the psi to huge amounts, the highest i saw on a car was 52 and it was on a street legal toyota supra but the engine was the most built thing i have ever seen, its 0-60mph time was just barely over a second. Superchargers are alright but not all that great, the highest psi ive seen from a supercharger was 18 psi i think. now its still fast and no lag and also probably more reliable then a turbo for most people but if you get someone who knows how to install and tune a turbo those are better|`|S9QyF6NQaa	depends on the car and its purpose|`|5kVyZyGGaa	oh man i love this question.  ask muscle car people and they will say superchargers and ask people from other countries they will say turbos. to be honest turbo is way way better.superchargers are just cheap and easy to put on that's why people don't like turbos bc it takes some work and cost money.|`|Tcp3vHMzaa	Turbo if you want more power.  Superchargers dont really work... maybe a 20 hp gain... MAYBE!|`|jsQhnXTiaa	It really depends on the purpose. The guy above me says that muscle car people will say Superchargers and hate turbos. Well thats not true, we love turbos and anything else that makes us go fast. Turbos are more efficient however they have a limit to the power they can make dependent on there size, and when you have a larger Turbo and a lot of boost you make a lot of boost lag. Example, you launch your car and your turbo boost really doesnt kick in until about 6000rpm at like and then all of the sudden you have all this power and it causes major traction issues and you can easily lose control, they also dont last as long, 5 years generally before they need to be rebuilt, less if they are ragged on hard enough. But another thing with Turbos is that they have a lot of tubing especially when there custom built for a car and a lot of piping has to be made and theres always going to be a little loss of pressure and if you dont get a tight seal you will lose efficiency. Now Superchargers are less efficient however in recent years they have become nearly as efficient as Turbos. However they have no lag whats so ever, as soon as you hit the gas all your power is there. They also last a lot longer, 10 years easily if well maintained. And like Turbos you can change the boost on them. Really its a preference on what you want.
gWlmU1KJaa	1997 will have a computer ignition, with a flywheel sensor  its fixed inside the computer    only a technician can diagnose a fault and fix the problem    older cars ( like 80's and older) you could do timing with a timing light and the information to move the distributor, cant do that with a computerized car|`|zOIgzIy4aa	on that car you don,t. the computer times it. if it,s not running right then it,s probably 1 of the sensors but on newer cars the computer does the timing as the chain wears.|`|S9QyF6NQaa	read the owners manual|`|A0v2KpVtaa	are you talking about setting the ignition timing? well if so, on that car ignition timing is controlled by the PCM and is not adjustable|`|NFK3A68oaa	If it has electronic ignition and a computer, then it probably doesn't need timing like the old cars--the Computer reads the engine information and adjusts the timing automatically as you drive.    At many auto parts stores you can buy a Haynes do-it-yourself manual for your model car, with step-by-step instructions, and basic explanations at the beginning of each chapter. If it is not in stock, you can order it on line by searching on "auto repair manuals" on Yahoo search. In the front is a section on "Troubleshooting" that guides you step-by-step to find causes of most engine malfunctions based on the car's symptoms. Whether you do the work yourself or not, it helps you make informed decisions and not be taken advantage of, and to not feel so "in the dark."  They are "the manual" for your car, like the service manual that some people buy with a new car.    Best regards,  Michael|`|gSeoBvi4aa	ziggy, the car has sensors that read both the cam shaft possition and the crank possition that set the timing for the spark. the timing chain setting is something I highly advice getting manual for because it can be touchy to get correct|`|JbeTyQocaa	if it is out of time you need to take it to a mechanic shop to be done right    if not you could get into a very costly situation
ebijsVIAaa	I am an A&P, I live in CA, AND I work on jets so let me tell you what I know. First of all, FIND a school near you - this dictates the price and what you end up with.    College (community or not) - usually 2 year program, including all additional non-aviation related classes you will end up with an associate degree - you still need to take your written, oral and practical exams. Most schools have a DME (designated mechanical examiner) or 2 on staff. It is also one of the more affordable ways of getting your A&P outside joining the military.     Specialty school (Westwood, etc) - 18 month program; non-degree - certificate to take the FAA General, Airframe Powerplant  written and O&P tests.  VERY expensive but the fastest way to your goal.      OR - You can join the military if you have the time; you can get a jet-mech specialty and come out with the knowledge to work on jets BUT you still need an A&P to work on civilian aircraft.  You can get a waiver (the FAA takes into consideration that you actually worked aircraft and accepts military experience in lieu of school) but you still have to do the testing. They have the GI bill when you get discharged after 4 years.  This is the least expensive, most time consuming route to follow.       What I tell prospective A&P's..... if you really, really, really want to be a tech and you want it soon, go to a college based program....you end up with more knowledge for less money.  If you have the time, join the military; you can actually work on jet aircraft in a shorter amount of time, get paid and come out with a military background - employers love that....AND consider other aviation related jobs...like ATC (traffic control) - better pay than AMT or even avionics. Don't forget you still have to find a job after school; if you can find a company that works only on jets, great!!  Sometimes you may have to gain experience and move up to working on jets.    Good luck.|`|AOPuoo16aa	You have three options. One You cab join the military and get your training there but you will still need to go to A&P school to get your certificates after you are out of the military. The biggest benefit of doing it this way is that the GI bill will cover your schooling. The second option is to go strait to A&P school. It is usually a 18 month course and will cost you $15k to $40k depending on what school you go to. The third option is to get a job as a mechanic working under a A&P mechanic for three years and then go and get your certificate.      Look at community colleges and tech schools in your area and see if they offer a A&P program. Some of the programs give you a  degree and at some you will only get the A&P certificate it just depends on the school.|`|litqXb4Naa	You'll need to go to school to get your A & P certificate.  I'm currently studying to get this certificate in an Aviation Maintenance Technology program (AMT).  It will take me 3 years to get both Airframe and Powerplant certificates.  I will also finish with an Associate of Applied Science (this will require you to meet your english and math prerequisites).  You will most likely need to buy your own tools as well.  The school you attend should provide you with a list.  With no tools to speak of to begin with, plan on $3,000 to get your toolbox off to a good start.|`|AA10547404	Chris is right.

If you buy it from another country, it is already "modified to their standards"|`|Q4NFFBizaa	If you bring a car in from another country it will have to pass emissions and safety standards before they state will let you register it. If its a newer car this should not be a problem as most new cars around the world can pass emissions and safety test. The older models you might have to pay a shop to fix the problems and that could be pricey. My suggestion would be find a car that is already here and registered.
mMFJrPbvaa	Military planes have their seats facing backwards, because it was found to be the safest thing for passengers on board.  When the plane slams into the ground the impact will be absorbed by your seat, since you will be pulled into the back of your seat, rather than being flung fwd like a conventional plane.  But do you really think the public can handle flying backwards? They would freak out because it is not the norm, unfortunately the norm is more dangerous.<br>  <br>  Flying is still more safer than driving, thousands of people die in car wrecks everyday, there aren't nearly as many people dying in plane crashes.  The only difference is in a plane crash theres hundreds of bodies in 1 location, car accidents are spread out across the country, more bodies just dispersed.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Are you nuts lol...you cant strap someones head to the backrest.  I`m a tall guy the backrest usually ends at the base of my head top of my neck, i`m not going to put a belt around my neck lol. First off how would you accommodate a child and then a really tall adult? You cant have the belts anchor points slide because then you run the risk of the belt sliding around the neck of an adult or sliding off the top of the head of a child.  Secondly, would you want a heavy metal buckle pressing up against your forehead or even on your head, the forces exerted on it could fracture your skull in an accident, especially a child's. <br>  <br>  If you are already leaning fwd. grabbing your ankles then you eliminate that whiplash effect because your already in that fwd position, no need for a head restraint.  Race car drivers only have a 5 pt belt system, which does not include a head restraint, they usually come out just fine.<br>  <br>  Like someone else posted, how many lives would actually be saved by the seat?  Its usually the fire caused by the fuel that kills the passengers on the plane, if they even survive the initial impact.|`|U24VtSlZaa	This is all pretty much academic, don't ya think?  Of all the fatalities in all the accidents in the history of commercial aviation, how many would have survived had the seat been facing the other way?<br>  <br>  Resources required for the design and implementation of a radically new interior configuration concept would be better spent on projects with better upside potential.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	This would all be very possible. <br>  <br>  However, most people don't want to pay, and can't afford, the price of a ticket on an airline that would work up too your expectation. Seats would have to be modified to not recline, since the upper belts would have to be fastened to the seatbacks. <br>  <br>  The seat mounting would have to be modified. You can't change the load point from the bottom of the seat to the top of the seat without changing the anchor point structure with the change in torque that would occur.<br>  <br>  Trains do have rear facing seats, I rode in many of them in Germany, and I hated it.<br>  <br>  A roll cage could be installed around every row of seats too. That would make the trip more comfy, I'm sure, as if it's already not uncomfortable enough.<br>  <br>  If you feel so unsafe, don't fly. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few...|`|dWLgwb3baa	Some good points there, and they have all been considered to some extent.  While your ideas are good and valid, I think you would be hard pressed to find many passengers to pay for a seat on an airplane that took all of those safety measures.  Just look at how many people feel the need to use the bathroom 3 minutes after takeoff while the seat belt sign is still on.  And that's just disregarding the requirement for a lap belt.<br>  <br>  The "brace" position actually DOES minimize severe injuries by placing your body in a position to minimize motion and trauma in case of a sudden deceleration.  If you weren't in the brace position, just as you mentioned, your body would be slung forward, causing trauma to the back and neck.<br>  <br>  With as hard as it already is to ensure passengers comply with the current rules, do you think the pubic would comply with and appreciate additional safety measures?  To secure the whole body, there would have to be at least a 4 point safety harness, and probably a head strap in addition.  I can just see it now: "In preparation for landing, please put any loose object back in your carry-on, stow your carry-ons under your seat, return your seat to its upright position, raise your headrest, secure your lap belt low around your hips, fasten your shoulder harnesses, keep your head straight, and make sure your head strap is secure around your forehead.  We hope you had a pleasant flight!"<br>  <br>  Backwards facing seats:  Yes, that would be safer, but most people do not like the sensation of sitting backwards.<br>  <br>  Silverware:  There is already a regulation that airline-supplied food, beverages, and associated serviceware may NOT be at any passenger seat during taxi, takeoff, or landing.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that airlines are already so safe that additional safety measures are taken if they make sense.  "Make sense" means that additional measures need to be proven that they will work and people will use them.<br>  <br>  Given the current safety record, I think most people would take their chances flying on a comfortable plane rather than a plane that doesn't allow carry-on bags, meals, or any other loose object in the cabin while you are flying facing backwards in a 5 point safety harness with your head secured in a stationary position and your feet flat on the floor.

I did purchase snow tires for it though.  I haven't had to have any repairs done other than routine maintenance.  One thing to keep in mind is that it is a Toyota vehicle, so you are getting a pretty reliable car.     Some people are put off by the looks of the xD, but since you like it I say go for it.

Convertibles have boxed and rail supports already welded into place from the factory - a coupe or fastback does not.  Realize the extensive work that a project such as this will involve and don't be fooled by the notion that all you have to do is cut the top off and fabricate retainers to reattach it.  And finally, my opinion, why not just purchase a convertible? If you insist on a hard top convertible, it would certainly be a great deal easier if you start with a convertible - and you'll never be caught in the rain with your hard top at home.|`|bW931jBaaa	DO IT!

You can never know who will walk up to your car. There are criminals that walk through parking lots looking in cars for things to steal, if they find you they could harm you.<br>  <br>   If you are in a cold climate you can freeze, and you can't leave the car running or you will die from carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust coming in the still car.<br>  <br>   You will also be asked to leave by the police if they find you. <br>  <br>  If you have to travel across country with little money ( you would have to have SOME money, what about gas money, food money and if the car Breaks down?) staying at a campground is only about 15 dollars a night.

gEw83TRTaa	First off, its not a "new" car and was never sold as such.  It was sold as a 2001 Hyundai.  So the notion that there is an expected level of operability is false.  ANy time you buy a used car - be it 6 months old, or 60 yrs old, you should get it inspected.  Take it to a mechanic beforehand and look for any signs of damage, rebuild, or upcoming mechanical failures.  <br>  <br>  Used cars are AS IS.  Unless there is a written guarantee, or a written statement of condition, then you own a car the minute ink is on paper.<br>  <br>  He never gave her a salvage title?  Odds are its not a salvaged car then.  Once a car is brnaded as salvage, it cannot be un-branded except to show "rebuilt".  cars are in accidents all the time and not converted to salvage.  Just because it was in an accident, that does not mean the car was a total loss.<br>  <br>  The dealer never told her?  Believe it or not, we dealers are not omnipotent.  We don't always know what the history of a car is either.  I cant tell you how many times customers have misrepresented their trade-in to me.  "Oh its in perfect condition" - then you find out that there is a cracked head or spun bearing - it happens daily.  You think dealers are unreliable?  Try dealing with the public for a month.  So, the dealer himself may not have been aware of an accident or rebuild.  Even if he was, he is not required to inform anyone<br>  <br>  ALWAYS inspect a car before you buy.  Otherwise you own a car, its history, and its problems.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Nothing to be lost about.<br>  <br>  She didn't do her homework before signing on the dotted line.  She now has to exercise her right to make all necessary repairs on her own dime as she has no legal leg to stand on.<br>  <br>  Inspect the car by use of a professional inspection service and save this hassle or be in this situation.  It's that simple.<br>  <br>  It gets tiring to keep mentioning this after the fact.  We need to make a sticky about this.|`|RbsRpcIyaa	No, the dealer is under no obligation to tell her. And, 99% of the time, the dealer will not know if a car has been wrecked or not. Sometimes, damages are not reported and a dealer would have no way of knowing that a trade was wrecked. All of this responsibility falls on the buyer. Any used vehicle purchase that is out of the manufacturer's original warranty is "as-is" unless stated on the contract. <br>  <br>  If the car would have had a "salvage" title, though, that changes. However, I seriously doubt if the dealer sold a car with a salvage title. That would have been disclosed. <br>  <br>  Services such as CarFax may or may not show this damage, so always tread lightly when using it. Damages under a certain amount may or may not show up on CarFax reports. Always best to have any used vehicle checked thoroughly by a licensed mechanic.|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	All used cars are sold as is. If the car doesn't have a salvage title, it wasn't TOTALLY rebuilt, and the dealer probably didn't know either. When you "were with her", did you guys take it to a mechanic and have it checked out? I'd take it back to that mechanic and ask some hard questions. Oh, you didn't take it to a mechanic? Shame on you. Live and learn. Good luck in the future.|`|TbiSBXclaa	Nothing illegal about it. No lawsuit.<br>  <br>  When purchasing a used car the mantra is always "Buyer Beware".<br>  <br>  If she didn't run a Carfax report and didn't have the vehicle ispected prior to the purchase then that is all on her.

To figure out which would be faster here's what you do:  find the curb weight of each vehicle.  EG civics (92-95) are light but then again so are tegs.  We'll call them even in this exampe (~2600 lbs).  Then find the horsepower and torqu of each engine.  GSR ~ 170 HP 130 Tq.  RS engine (B18A1) 140 HP 120 Tq. <br>  <br>  Then all you do is power to weight ratio and the civic obviously has more power.  You can give the 93 rs about 10-15 HP with those boltons but that's being generous.
83b60f2fdd03f49375b7489077add40baa	Well, there wasn't really too much else you could've done.  However, I would recommend being more aware of the traffic around you.  There should have been no "if" there was a car beside or behind me.  Be aware of your surroundings by checking mirrors more often because had you hit a car beside you, you could have accidentally killed/injured someone completely innocent.  Your only choice, if someone was beside you would have been to hit the car that cut you off, and in the short distance you had, brake heavily but try not to skid.  Skidding increases stopping distance which equals a higher speed collision which equals more damage and increased chances for injury.  Take care.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	You handled this situation good. There's nothing else you could have done to avoid this. There would have been an accident if there was a car in the left lane and unfortunately you probably would have been found at fault if you hit a car in the left lane if it was in your blind spot. In that situation if I knew moving to the left lane was impossible then I would have just hit the car turning in front of me while slamming on the brakes. I mean what else are you suppose to do if there was no exit to avoid the car without hitting another car.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	Sounds like you handled it pretty well. I would have done about the same thing. Always remember to swerve to the direction the other car is coming from. That and braking is about all you can do. I had a couple deer run out coming from my right a couple months ago at about 12:30 am and did about the same thing you did, but I swerved to the right and braked. I was running about 70 mph though. I missed them.

Then I will reinstall the breather filter and go on my merry way.  At least for the evolution motors, this is normal operating procedure.

u2QhQAxzaa	Okay well if you need a new battery I suggest you go down to the local Pep Boys or Auto Zone and get one.  Make sure to get a name brand like Duralast or Interstate.  Don't get a Centennial, had that brand and died on me in 4 months.    Also I had this problem with the sub draining my battery so make sure you buy a capacitor, which will help out your battery a lot.  They are around $100 to 150 dollars and I recommend a Rockford Fosgate brand.|`|27RtU0Oraa	if you hooked it up right your car shouldnt just die like i have a 1000 watt alpine just like yours running 2 12in mtx's and mine works just fine and iv had it hooked up for months with no aftermarket battery or nothing .. and dont listen to the guy who says buy a cap thats just wasting your money .. if your system cant handle what you got now .. if you add a cap it will only make it worse so just save your money and dont do it|`|TPfFpotWaa	Maybe you left a loose wire connected to your battery?

The G20 motor is simple and any mechanic can work on it. The engine is timing chain driven so you don`t have to worry about replacing it. I have seen 300k on a 93` My guess is that suspension issues will come up but that is normal for the age.

nP92OdBzaa	The oil should be fine, even though you should change it more often as other people since you barely warm up the car on your drive to school.  The main issue that you get the low MPG is because the engine is cold for most of your drive. A cold engine will use much more gas then when it's in the proper operating range. I would advise you to take a longer drive when you go home. Drive it at least 15 min, so the engine really warms up. It's not just the MPG, but over time you will get large amounts of carbon build up if you never drive it long enough for it to burn off. There is a whole list of components that suffer from very short trips, especially in very cold weather.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	if the oil is dirty and low then it can put a drag on moving parts and make the engine work harder. maybe all it needs is a good tune-up. that,s a nice car though, probably has a 3800 engine which is a damn good engine.i have 1 in my oldsmobile.|`|S9QyF6NQaa	oil change will not have an effect on miles per gallon, and the in car gauges never work anyways, compare the miles you go to the amount of gas you use.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	You fuel mileage is dependent on conditions - and a typical winter in Chicago is probably as tough as it gets. Good clean oil will certainly help eliminate friction and drag inside the engine, especially on a bitter cold morning, but I suspect the benefits would favor less wear and tear on the engine more than any significant increase in fuel economy.   As the weather warms up and the roads become a little less restrictive, your mileage will increase.|`|zEVpA4WCaa	The two are in no way related . keep your foot out of it, and your gas mileage will pick up. Try recording the mileage next time you fill up and see how much you use between fill ups,divide the miles driven by the of amount of gas you use between fill ups.|`|GIjuCLKhaa	Oil can have a minor effect on mileage if it's too heavy. Its age is not good as water & other contaminants can accumulate in the oil with extended storage. Change it and the filter.  MPG? The EPA numbers are a joke and were calculated in the lab with no engine accessories (Alternator, etc). As a rule take the highway mileage and divide by 2 to get the typical average experience. Also, cold weather and short runs will give low mileage.|`|65Czd36Waa	when you start your car when its cold, the pcm will add extra fuel until it warms up,so if your only 5 min away, forget about efficency, that mpg   is based on a car that is warmed up, and yes dirty or low oil will  decrease it , think about it , dirty oil, more friction on the mechanical components, the motor has to work that much harder to keep up, thus using more fuel. so keep it clean and changed, and dont forget to change your air filter regularly, that has a huge effect on mileage, ppl sometimes overlook the simple things, good luck|`|aQKTSU8iaa	City driving, especially in the cold, will really affect the mileage. The oil doesn't really need to be changed at 3,000 mile intervals but it's recommended. Also, make sure the oil is synthetic and use a light weight of oil in the winter. You should notice the car driving smoother, quieter and more efficiently. Good luck.|`|bW931jBaaa	The oil will not alter the mileage unless it is very low.  Your foot is the problem. To get ideal mileage, you have to drive SLOW like an old lady.  I have the same problem with all my vehicle. The best mileage I get is in my big diesel truck and that is 14mpg on average (when I drive like a little old lady. If I have fun driving around, I get 7-9mpg)    You should change your oil every 5000 miles. 3000 is too early and a scam designed by the oil companies. As far as every 3 months.....that is pure B.S.. Oil will not go bad sitting in an oil pan. Ifit did, it would have a born on date like beer and an experation date like food.|`|gSeoBvi4aa	a proper service on that car would include an air filter change, I'd buy a K and N to help get a bit better air flow and never needing to replace it, a good set of spark plugs, high end bosch would be great, set air presure to max cold presure (cold meaning tires havent rolled yet by the way. replace the fuel filter because unless the car was maintained by a reputable mechanic they dont replace them enough. run a few bottles of fuel injection system cleaner thru the engine (1 bottle per tank) and if the car tends to crank quit a bit prior to starting consider replacing the fuel pump in the gas tank, GM tends to have problems with them) all of these can benifit you milage a lot. ps 19/27 was number the factory declaired was possible, reality is never that. 13 is possible if you are doing only stop and go driving (city) because highway was the 27 but is likely gonna be 24 mpg. additional point about oil change. recently I had the oportunity to listen to a spokes person for K and N and in his thoughts on oil change I learned a bit. I have long believed in using synthetic oils and believe me you need it! sysnthetics were designed in the beggining for fighter planes because the air was so cold that the oil was freezing and the motors stalling. synthetic stopped this problem. your coolant protection needs to be higher than average as well. the thought I learned about kand N was the flow of oil through an oil filter. oil trapped from flowing inside an oil canister isnt doing any favors to the engine. sure we want clean but your block wants oil! it couldn't care less if its clear as melting ice from a glacier or dark as crued oil as long as it lubricates. contamination of oil affects wear and tear on the engine not too much at all on actual friction. friction can be thought of as how smoothly something can pass through the fluid. the smoother is passes through it the less friction. friction causes heat. rub you hands togather, they got warm right? thats friction heat if you dont rub as hard you dont get as warm. this applies to the bearings and pistons. there are two different heats to your engine. coolant heat and oil heat (of course there is exhaust heat!) but the two heats I meantioned are different. water temp is actually the block temp the oil temp is generated by the friction surfaces and can reach very high temps. the heavier the oil the more it can absorb the heat but the slower it flows and it heats up slower as well. the thick oil also adds friction. the thinner oils reduce friction, improve milage due to the less friction but can increase oil temps not to a dangerous condition though. milage increase can be very slight to just noticable.|`|GiOamMFzaa	Hi Toffa. Strange as it might seem, cars that do relatively low mileage need oil changes & general maintenance more than their harder working relatives.  The reason is that short haul motoring does not allow the engine to come to optimum operating temperature & get rid of internal condensation, get the oil circulating and generally blow out the cobwebs.A good blast down the freeway occasionally is good for a motor, compare it to a guy going out jogging & the man who sits behind a desk all day.  Better still, get the oil changed, have a full service done on the car and go and pick up Grandma from the retirement home & take her for a trip. You will all benefit from the outing! Good Luck & my best regards to Grandma.|`|Bl9zcqxQaa	With the use of oxygen sensors on todays vehicles, yes, old oil can "slightly" effect your fuel  mileage, as an excessive amount of fuel built-up in your crankcase can fool an oxygen sensor into effecting how much fuel is needed during operation of the car running.  But deep down- your issue is simple, the car isnt being driven enough and its being used in cold temps.    I own a 2008 4x4 Chevy Silverado with 8k miles on it, the truck will normally get around 15-17mpg.   Right now, as I work 1 mile from my house, and its also winter time, I am getting approx 7-8 mpg.  Why?  The vehicle is never at engine running temp., a cold engine uses more fuel.   Theres nothing you can do about it, nothings going to fix it unless you drive the car more and its warmer outside.
78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	My first question is why did you put "type F" in a 94 Explorer?  It is designated as Mercon fluid.  Type F will not provide the protection your tranny needs, and actually hasn't been used since the 70's.  Using the wrong fluid has probably caused massive transmission damage, not to mention you have a huge leak.  You might as well just look for a good used transmission, or go for a remanufactured replacement.  Next time use the fluid type that the transmission calls for.  It's printed on the trans dipstick.|`|RTBvQJHbaa	Umm Ouch  Locate your leak first is it on the ground? if not check your Coolant if it's in there that's the best thing you can hope for at this point, but if your having those problems, you might want to sell it/get rid of it.  Trans are not cheap and not easy to put in unless your 400 pounds of nothing but muscle.  Being as old as it is, the parts will be cheaper and it should be cheaper for an install because of the type.  I don't know your money situation but if your driving that around it's not too good I'm thinking.  All likely hood it's a gonna die pretty quick and painfully Don't plan any long road trips, and try to save and look.

276aa285c0c3bcae2ed83a2a0b8cfa53aa	If you have to stop then stop the checks are to make sure you are safe, they don't take long and you will be off again fairly quick anyway.    I am sure your family would prefer you home alive then have to try and identify the body.    When you first learn to ride you have an awful lot to take in and it all comes with practise, practise, practise.    You need to learn two things here from what you have said slow riding and I mean slow and turning to the right.    Deal with them both seperatly.    Do you have a big car park near you that has a quiet area in the evening.  If so use it practise riding as slow as possible first then get slower and slower until you can balance on the bike with very little movement at all (This will also be part of the test and will help with u-turns and getting round mini roundabouts).  Don't worry about looking like a prat and if asked to move on do so.  Unless you bothering someone most people just leave you alone.    Then practise left and right turns doing all your checks.  Use your knees to hug the petrol tank (read it in a RIDE magazine) and it works it stops you from grabbing the handlebars so much and makes the turn smoother.    The Yamaha YBR is a very forgiving bike (Was my first bike) and you will get it.    See if you have any motorcycle clubs in your area and go along to get advice, any decent ones will allow members to join what ever the bike after all we all started on smaller bikes at sometime.|`|S9QyF6NQaa	Practice practice practice. it will come in time, just take your time, you are doing everything right but as you said you are a new rider and like all skills in life it takes time to learn|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Practice makes perfect.  If you are emerging from a secondary feeder road onto a main artery and do not have a stop sign (stop signal?) then as you are approaching the intersection start looking as soon as you can see the entire area ahead of you.  (and to the sides).    Do not wait so long to start looking.      Here in the states, many of us as soon as we start on the merge ramp start looking in that sides rear view mirror as well as an over the shoulder check of the side on which we will be merging into.  How would you do it if you were in a car?|`|AA10582974	This isn't an answer to your question.    Would someone be so kind as to explain this question to me in American English?  UK driving to me is confusing.  Thanks.|`|WxqeMSw7aa	First of all you need to slow down sooner rather than later. Nice and smooth. Can you remember how to control your bike with the clutch ? If you get the wobbles then clutch control will help.   Secondly, find yourself a nice open space ( like an after hours car park ) , and practise using something like traffic cones, you must know someone with a car who can help with this, I don't recommend trying to carry cones on a bike !  Thirdly, its better to stop and check than to be thinking about it later in hospital.    Practise, practise, practise. I passed my test ages ago and I still practise when I get a chance now.    Ride safe|`|dKK2Tjy6aa	Hi    I have been riding bikes since 1986 and my advice is to simply take your time. You appear to have the procedure correct so if you feel happier stopping at a Giveway to ensure the road is clear then do so. Over time your reactions will quicken and the need to stop will get less and less. Remember most people will always stop but it is optional,if the coast is clear, that you can proceed while still rolling.     Turning right onto a main road can be dangerous on a bike as car drivers are never looking out for you so I still stop even after 20 + years of riding !    You are doing fine just take you time and be safe.|`|AA10287397	man just chill out ok, take a deep breath , u need to relax a bit , if u have to stop then just stop at the junc. or do a slow roll through , go to an empty lot and practice going slow less then 5mph and it will help.. and NEVER ride faster than ur skill|`|nY3PAjtRaa	panic is the problem here, most of the time when emerging right from a junction you would probably have to stop as it is unlikely that you would have the same feild of veiw as turning left why are you doing a lifesaver when you are already in middle of road.  if you know you are going to turn right then.  mirror signal/lifesaver manoeuvre . at this point check your position on road/check speed then look right/left/right if clear go if not stop.  if you have already made your move toward the centre of the road to turn right then the final lifesaver you are doing is unnecessary as there shouldn't be any Traffic on your right as you are already up against the white line|`|HXtmCz8Laa	if you feel you havent done enough checking then its probably because you haven't. On a bike your visibility is restricted by the view from your visor, ( and how far you can turn your head)!!  You say you are losing control by going to the junction slower..........practice slow clutch or brake( usually front) control( depending on incline of road),,,,in fact practice trying,,,,,, to stop with feet up!,,,,also try to practise-- R/L, lifesaver/final R--then L as you emerge......so that you are not looking over shoulder at your slowest speed? Think about where vehicles may be earlier ( in your road,behind you)

bW931jBaaa	Check the VIN at the DMV to find out. If it is not in your name, you will have to get a title from the old owner or a request for new title filled out and notarized.

If you have it licensed and drove it (you said 04 but then you said it's been sitting 2 years) look at the registration.  The name there should match the name on the title.    But since you said you never put it in your name, it's not even your car.  You might ask the DMV for advice.|`|FsT54qh1aa	If you never titled the vehicle in your name, it isn't in your name. As said, you should ask the person that sold it to you...to get you a fresh title for it from the DMV and have that person sign the car over to you. If you can't do that for some reason, explain the situation to the DMV and ask them what you need to do next.

Then I broke a mount and did not replace it that day. Later that night I blew up the entire transaxle.  Flex is what causes VW bus transaxles to break. Strap it in as good as you can.

Like one of the previous posts mentioned, you can likely fit a supercharger, but you may have issues with fitment of the supercharger pulley system as well (I haven't poked my head under a scion hood to see how well a small 'charger will fit).

Try putting the key in, tapping the head of the key with light to medium taps, while trying to turn the key (a pair of pliers or vise grips on the key helps). Once the tumbler pops loose you can spray some lock lubricant (graphite) into the lock cylinder, or get a new one installed by a locksmith. There are no recalls but Chrysler does sell a revised lock cylinder. Good luck|`|KstxPYPTaa	You can do what the first guy said.

Your only option will be to be added to your parents policy as an additional driver, and only their company can tell you what the increase will be.|`|0B0ycKw3aa	Hello new driver :)    If you are a young driver attempting to find cheap and affordable car insurance you are probably already aware of the challenge that lies ahead. The statistics about teenage drivers arent good. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), 16-year-olds get into accidents almost six times more often than drivers between the age of 30 and 59. No wonder car insurance premiums are so high for this age group. It has always been difficult if you are aged between of 16 - 25 to insure your car affordably, and although car insurance companies are beginning to recognize the need to supply this ever expanding market, it can still prove to be hard to find a reasonably priced car insurance premium.    For instance, young drivers will often own older or less maintained vehicle compared to other drivers, which means they are more likely to break down and potentially cause an accident. Teenage drivers are also more likely to have accidents which can either injure themselves or the other party.    However, parents should be aware if the fact that there are several ways that can help lower car insurance costs for your teen. In order for teen drivers and car insurance to work well together, parents need to know the factors that will help contribute to paying less for their son or daughters auto insurance in the future.    The first thing that insurance providers look into when giving a car insurance quote is the driving record of the person. Teenagers that have a good driving record may merit consideration. What that means is that you can help keep your teen focused on safe driving by having him or her pay a portion of the auto insurance premium. Also, be sure to let your teen know the consequences of getting traffic tickets.    Before you purchase your car it is also worth researching which insurance group it will fall in, so that you can ensure you will be able to get the cheapest possible insurance.    Finally, by using Insurance4lessdirect.com you can rest assured that we will strive to find you the cheapest car insurance premium that will provide you and your teenager with the best cover.    Did you know: If youre adding your teen driver to your auto insurance policy, be sure to take advantage of the auto insurance discount for good students, available in many states.

S9QyF6NQaa	if its leaking somewhere you should be able to see where water is leaking from the motor, if its leaking from a hose, then replace that hose, if its leaking out of the water pump then its either the pump or the gasket, if its leaking out of a freeze plug you will need a tow so get the freeze plug replaced, if there arent any leaks then you will need it towed to either get new intake manifold gaskets or a new head gasket.  price could range anywhere from under $20 for a hose or up to a couple thousand for a new head gasket.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	don,t start it but fill it up and take each hose and twist it some. if it,s a hose then it will start to leak. water pumps usually leak a lot when it,s running.|`|65Czd36Waa	fill it , start it , watch it, see where its leaking, if you still can see it , see a mechanic, but dont over heat it , you could damage the engine|`|dQrBlk4qaa	Yes - look for the leak!!!!    With the car off, look for stains on the radiator, or puddles of greenish fluid anywhere. If you see puddles, look for the hoses/connections above them. If you see a stain near the water pump mounting on your car, you are likely having a water pump issue (or a hose clamp has worn a hole in one of your hoses mounted to the pump)    If you don't see anything, add water to your car, and look for immediate leaks. You should see something. Check under the car for puddling. Turn off the car and immediately check under the hood - many times your coolant will remain pressurized long enough to continue leaking after its shut off for a little while.|`|c48nm70gaa	We can't actually tell weather it's the water-pump, radiator, heater hoses, radiator hoses, heater core or clamps without a close inspection.    If you're not use to laying on your back under your car held up by jack-stands, hire a private mechanic to do it for you. He will have a simple test instrument to pull off a *cooling system pressure test. A leak source will be apparent in seconds. It's a very inexpensive test also. Get her done before you burn up the motor.

Your bucking and backfiring and poor mileage all sound like they point to the o2 sensor.  Stalling at idle after a short drive (say at a stop light maybe) and difficult startup are also common symptoms.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I can't totally rule out the fuel pump.  The symptoms are very similar as they're both fuel starvation problems.  You can take the car to a shop and get them to measure the fuel pressure to rule that out.  If you can get it started of course.<br>  <br>  I have to disagree with the answer that says 99% of the time it's plugs, wires or distributor.  It certainly isn't in my experience, 99% of the time it's a fuel issue, not spark.<br>  <br>  I'm also going to disagree with the fuel filter idea.  A clogged fuel filter wouldn't cause poor mileage, if anything it'd probably be better mileage as it restricted fuel flow.  Come to think of it, last time my fuel pump went bad I actually got better mileage then too.  Hmmmm, maybe we can rule out that fuel pump.  And air filter?  Is he serious?  OK, go ahead and check it.  If it's black and looks like it's been dunked in mud, that could be it.  Of course I'm kidding, an air filter will never cause a car not to start.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	Even with the o2 failing the car should still start. It sounds like you need the fuel filter changed. If the o2 was failing or the car was misfiring you would get a code. But simple things like the fuel filter, air filter and ect will not cause a code. Try a full tune-up first.|`|nAK8bm91aa	Kelika?<br>  Start with what I call the stupid stuff first like the fuel filter.<br>  Then also add STP water remover, if you have water in your tank it will sputter, stall, not even start, why ? Because an engine does not run on water. If your fuel pump pulls in water and sends it to the engine guess what, no start.|`|DV4xyeChaa	1 o2 sensor will NOT keep it from starting<br>  2  ever been tuned up..99% of time its plugs/wires..cap rotor..not fuel problem<br>  3 what yr..what car...what miles?????|`|NbCBk3mqaa	O2 sensors will not keep your car from running,You need to have it scaned,just because the engine light isnt on does not mean theres no codes.Tune ups do wonders.|`|285b98a01876e1a83f6a503f40258aa6aa	Not sure if Chrysler will do this, But my 84 Corvette would go into a "Limp Mode" when certain sensors failed. It would run rough, suck gas like mad, but at least get you home. The computer is programmed to do this. This may be your problem. In my case the distributor was the culprit, It was a modular distributor with the coil mounted on the cap, I replaced all components in the distributor, there aren't many.<br>  This problem was intermittent, by the way, It would come and go every few hours. There was no use able fault codes to help me with this problem, which is often the case.|`|8823042827de50d202b1ecf3cbf9af80aa	It could. If you're seeing an O2 sensor code I'd definitely start there.

TbiSBXclaa	Make sure this is the car you want first. Take it for a nice long test drive including some highway miles.  Check it over thoroughly.  Compare prices with other similar cars in your area.  Do your online research, run a Carfax report and determine fair market value for the car.  If you know this is the one you should always take the car to a certified mechanic for a complete pre-purchase inspection. <br>  <br>  If they know you will buy the car they will deal.  They aren't going to waste time on casual lookers or "tire kickers".  When it comes down to negotiating a price be firm, fair and honest. Start at 20% off advertised price and go from there.  Let them know you have cash and are ready to buy today if they meet your price. <br>  <br>  $7000 for an RX300 sounds like a reasonable price to me, but there is always room for negotiations.|`|4959b5e3a4c7affc41472f154ad09de2aa	It's always a good idea to search the area for comparible prices.  You will also want to get all the info on the car and look up the Kelly Blue Book price.  If you are planning on trading in a car do not tell the dealership you are buying the car from untill you agree on purchase price.  Most dealerships will also give discounts if you pay in cash so once you get the price where you want it just ask, "If I pay cash what kind of discount can you give me?".|`|5IO1JEY1aa	I just sold that same truck a few weeks ago.....Simply, offer the dealership that's selling the truck.<br>  <br>  $6500.00 Drive out.<br>  <br>  That will include the price of the truck, tax, title and license.<br>  <br>  I'm certain they will do it.|`|GqTSa85daa	I'd check the car with a fine tooth comb, any flaw would be questioned.

mKVFIklaaa	Here's what the practical test comprises of;<br>  <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/LearnerAndNewDrivers/PracticalTest/DG_4022540" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/Lea...</a><br>  <br>  Basically, people learn at different speeds: Some people have an aptitude and/or interest in driving, whilst others just see it as a necessity. If you fall into the latter category (and without being at all sexist, most women do), then you're going to take longer to learn than someone enthusiastic about driving for the sake of it - the same as any subject you try to learn.<br>  <br>  Many people take months or years to learn, but I've been around a long time and I have some observations about learning to drive;<br>  <br>  Firstly, I'm pretty convinced that many (but certainly not all) driving instructors string the job out - a friend's daughter learnt with the AA recently & booked 'blocks' of lessons in ten hour chunks: I know it was a good few years ago, but when I was 17, I can't remember anyone of my age having more then ten or fifteen lessons prior to passing a test, either first or second attempt. Failing twice was virtually unheard of, and most people passed within three or four months of their 17th birthday. That was before power steering, ABS brakes & cars with fuel injection that are very difficult to stall! Clunky gearboxes, small door mirrors, etc., etc.<br>  <br>  Secondly, practice! When I was 17 (again!) I'd try & drive every day in between my one hour a week lessons - taking my mother to the shops or just turning the car around or practicing moving off, hill starts, etc. Again, everyone did the same, and I can't understand how anyone can expect to pass with one weekly lesson & nothing in between: How many years would it take you to pass a GCSE with one lesson a week?<br>  <br>  Thirdly & Finally, you need to have some appreciation of exactly what mechanical processes occur when you turn the wheel, press a pedal or change gear. Why does a car need five or six gears? Why does it stall? Why shouldn't you 'ride' the clutch? You will never, ever meet an excellent driver who has absolutely no mechanical knowledge of what goes on under the bonnet. Unfortunately, the culture now perpetuated by things like 'Top Gear' is to be completely ignorant of how your car works, what it does, maintenance, technical information, etc - entertaining it may be, but other car programmes on TV use drivers & car enthusiasts, not presenters & their lackies.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can give is to be enthusiastic & interested, and either practice, or have more frequent lessons. I know they're expensive, so maybe buying a ￡200 car would pay for itself very quickly as a practice vehicle? Or ask friends or family if you can drive theirs - there are ompanies that will insure cars for one day at a time.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|wlqUMBZbaa	Ditch your school - they are taking you for a ride - you should have done your theory a long lomg time ago!<br>  <br>  At the very least get a second opinion!!!<br>  <br>  One lesson with another driving school will tell you all you need to know|`|CfruVK4Jaa	A good general rule to work out how many driving lessons you will need is your age times 1.5. So if you are 18 years old 18x1.5 which equals 27 hour lessons. Have you had more?<br>  <br>  Get in touch with another school and instructor and book a mock driving test. This will tell you if you are capable of passing the real test.<br>  <br>  Some people have taken longer than 9 months but in my experience these are the very nervous drivers. If you feel comfortable on the road and have an average ability then you should have at least taken the test by now.|`|BugeV1Mdaa	It took me 9 months but that was because I failed my first two tests due to anxiety attacks...<br>  I was ready to take my test after 6.<br>  Everyone learns at a different pace and many people have the advantage of getting their parents to take them out driving so they get far more experience outside lessons - my parents only had a 3l Jag which they would never insure me on. <br>  I would be wary that your instructor isn't dragging things out though; they might be trying to get as much money from you as possible (although when you think about it, that's not really logical as the lesson slots you're taking up would just be used for someone else anyway).<br>  It's really important to get on with your instructor and enjoy your lessons - if you don't, find a new instructor.|`|LCtP3CXEaa	Sorry to hear of your plight, but it may surprise you to know that I hear the same story over and over again.<br>  <br>  Instructors teach in different ways but sadly I am sure you still have a way to go after roundabouts but starting in June and only doing them a Christmas does sound far too long!<br>  <br>  It can only be one of two reasons why it is taking you so long<br>  <br>  1. It is your instructor, so give another a try but make sure you ask their grade before booking- you need a grade 5 or 6, 6 is the highest grade an instructor can get and usually the better the grade the better an instructor!<br>  <br>  2. It is you, so to be so blunt but it may be you are just one of those people that find it hard to learn or it may be that you forget too much between lessons, but there are ways to improve this as detailed below;<br>  <br>  Write it down - as soon as your lesson ends put pen to paper and write some notes to help you remember the key points covered. <br>  <br>  Increase your lessons - try 2 hour lessons (it is amazing how much quicker people learn doing this) or if you forget too much between lessons then go twice a week so you have a shorter gap.<br>  <br>  Book an intensive course - with the right company it is a fantastic way to learn with so much time to practise and no time to forget. check out www.academy.me.uk for residential courses they really know their stuff and are number 1 on Google search for residential intensive driving courses! You can check out their customer feedback on the link below.<br>  <br>  A car of your own may be a good way to go but the insurance may be too high to make it worthwhile. I have put another link in below that may find you cheaper insurance and will cover you just for short periods whilst learning<br>  <br>  Good luck

It doesn't mean that the efficiency of the sub changes.  So if you power it with say 1000w RMS, for example, it will be the same output with the BP option as it would without the BP option.  The BP option would just let the sub handle a little more power then without it.<br>  <br>  If you set the gain properly you will not need to worry about the Qs blowing.

b687b3ff1fb58e7c7e6b81ec02a11177aa	I'm almost positive you cross-wired it.  Backfires mean one of two things, either the mixture is way way off (usually lean if backfiring out the intake, rich if out the exhaust), or a spark plug is firing at the wrong time.  Since the backfiring started when you switched out the wires, it's pretty tell-tale.<br>  <br>  Make sure as you go around the distributor, the wires go to the cylinders in the proper firing order.  I bet two are switched.

Also the amount of liability you're choosing to carry will have a big effect too. Also, is that for just liability or do you also have medical payments, collision, comprehensive, etc? Did you have a car before or just your license, if you didn't have a car to insure then it's not as bad as driving without insurance - that will drive the price up a lot too.<br>  There are a lot of factors when it comes to price! If price is your biggest concern then calling around (sounds like you have) will be the best thing to do.|`|pXIKbbscaa	There is no ONE insurance company that is right for everyone - everyone is rated individually - and all companies have different "likes and dis-likes", different credit tiers, different business models, and many other factors that can vary your rate - and a QUOTE is ONLY a quote until the policy is issued.<br>  <br>  Typically, insurance rates will vary from State to State and can even vary by ZIPCODE! It also will depend on the type of car/truck, coverages, limits of liability, and driving record. Some companies run credit scores and MOST run a motor vehicle report and CLUE (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange) report to see about undisclosed accident involvement.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is call a LOCAL independent agent or broker.

TjIOgvQjaa	I had similar problems last year and was glad I got my repairs covered under my extended warranty. They are if you don't buy them from the manufacturer. <a href="http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-Warranty.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-Wa...</a>|`|mTwn8p79aa	New master cylinder.  That's what makes a car have "power" brakes.  Expect four digits on the repair bill.  If it's failing it would provide sporadic boost, meaning it would require different amounts of pressure on the pedal to get the same stopping force depending on how well it's working that day.<br>  <br>  I agree with your dad, if it ain't broke . . .<br>  <br>  OK, you could cross your fingers that it's air in the system.  They should be able to bleed the system (that just means purge it of air bubbles) for around $75.  Air in the system would make the pedal have excessive travel to get the stopping force you'd expect because the air in the system, unlike brake fluid, will compress in the lines.  The air compressing will make it so the caliper won't grab the rotor with as much force.  <br>  <br>  You could also have a leak, but you should have noticed that your brake fluid was low if was leaking.<br>  <br>  A "brake job" can be as little as new pads (for the front disc brakes) and new shoes (for the drums brakes in back) and could cost as little as $100.  It could also include new rotors (they probably can't turn them again as they're probably too thin) to anything up to new brake calipers.  Expect a bill in the high $800's if you need new calipers (I'm sure you don't, I'm just saying there's a big range depending on what you need.)<br>  <br>  Just FYI, brake pads should last at about 50,000 - 90,000 miles depending on driving style and city/highway miles.|`|nAK8bm91aa	Juanita ?<br>  <br>  When I do a proper brake job ok ?<br>  I remove the wheels of course. Then I remove the brake calipers, then I remove the rotors, have the rotors turned (scraped) and replace the pads with only either one of these brands "wagner" or "Bendix" Why, they last longer then 19.99 pads.<br>  Now what I do is before installing the pads I use Disk brake quiet around the caliper bore to reduce any potential noise that may occur, then install the pads in place. Now I purge the brake fluid in both brake calipers to remove any water or sediment. A hard brake pedal might be a good thing but it should "never" go completely to the floor.<br>  Back brakes......Remove wheel, Remove the brake drum or rotor, replace the shoes or pads, cut either one drums or rotors, always replace the return springs, bleed the rear brakes, put wheel back on, I'm done. If I find that any of the brakes mechanism is not working properly I instantly replace it, Your life is at stake here.|`|285b98a01876e1a83f6a503f40258aa6aa	It sounds similar to a problem I had years ago, at times it felt like I was pushing on a brick, other times normal. It turned out to be the power booster, which is the can looking thing mounted on the firewall under the hood. The intent of this device is to help you push the brakes(power assist) sometimes it does the opposite, air in the brake lines won't do this. This is a dangerous situation, don't let it go too long.<br>  Eventually it will not stop you at all!|`|657e10481636c483b83406f4b297a91faa	3 or 4 YEARS? Get to a shop for inspection!<br>  I suspect you have no shoes left and are using metal backing plates to stop. That will cause hard petal pressure and eat rotors and drums.<br>  Find a trustworthy shop and go.|`|Y33NEqqLaa	first of all replace the brake drum with rotor disk brakes, this is more efficient and easier to service. as for the brake pedal not being consistent replace the brake piston kit and u will be ok.
PvlpJ1IFaa	i don't really know dude. All i know is IF you have to replace it, you need to buy a $80 piece that plugs into the radio. Apperently, GM made their vehicles brain sync with the radio. So if you put in a new radio, within a month, the brain could fry. I know this becuase my buddy was a idiot and cut out a piece and 3 weeks later, his lights didn't turn on, radio didn't turn on, car barely started, gauges worked once in a while. he got the piece and 2 weeks later everything was fine till the lights. He has yet to fix his Dash/Counsil lights. So just given a a heads up. And it's $80 at the place i get it. He's the cheapest around here. A chevy dealer wants $200. I couldn't tell ya why t stopped workin though.  I hope someone else can give ya a answer.  Mine is just incase you gotta replace it. Good Luck.
7BHIyMFmaa	70%, that's what it was in 2005 at least. At any rate the V6's don't offer that much better fuel economy over the V8s (1 MPG difference according to the EPA).|`|HUluAQM3aa	9 out of 10 are V6 equipped.
6cwJi5kxaa	Even though you dont have the title yet you should be able to show them proof of registration your id and possible the paperwork showing that you bought the car. I dont think the finance company will help you. You should just take care of it yourself. If you reported the car stolen and theres a record of it with the police department then they should be able to help you as well.
CBJge2kxaa	It doesn't come form the DMV it comes from the lien holder such as the bank, anywhere from 3-6 weeks.
jieKgKF1aa	somebody else is driving your car.
iqMPvr7Taa	No you should of found a place to park it. You are just going to have to pay the towing and storage fees. That's the only way to get your car back. I don't know how long they had it , but tow yards only keep them for set period of time. ( 30 - 60 days) It varies. Then they will sell the car and sue you for their fees. You better go get it because of the time in the tow yard plus fees are added daily...........md
4TZsKgAUaa	Stop driving it immediately!<br>  <br>  If it isn't changed at the proper intervals, the coolant in the Rover V8 WILL cause head gasket leaks and failures.  Proper service intervals are every 30,000 miles for a flush and refill.  These vehicles are very sensitive to coolant condition, and it is almost a guarantee that this is your issue.<br>  <br>  Head gaskets can be done at home, but you probably aren't up to the task.  It isn't a complex job, but it requires lots of experience to do properly on this engine.<br>  <br>  Do not cheap out on this.  Get the real Rover head gasket kit.  Make sure you get genuine parts.  Go to Atlantic British, the dealer, or Rovers north and order the kits you need.  Speak clearly with the vendor and make sure everyone understands what vehicle you have, and what you are attempting to do.<br>  <br>  You CANNOT re-use the bolts.  You DO need every gasket from the block up.  Now is not only a perfect time to get that valve job and deck the heads, it is REQUIRED time.  Speak with the people at Atlantic British or the dealer and order EVERYTHING they say you will need.  You cannot get away with anything on this job, and you have already pushed things too far as it is.<br>  <br>  At the dealer, this job is several thousand dollars.  It will be cheaper elsewhere, but you don't want to go just anywhere.  You want a mechanic that either works on a lot of Rovers or handles Mercedes vehicles on a regular basis.  You want a mechanic that is used to European cars with aluminum block engines.  There is generally such a mechanic available that deals primarily with European and Japanese imports.  By the powers, check his reputation first, though, and if he tells you you need a new engine, he is more than likely lying.<br>  <br>  If you do not follow my advice to the letter here, you will learn a terrible lesson.  You are probably only a few miles out from destroying your engine.  With Discovery values as low as they are, that can actually eclipse the value of the vehicle, effectively totaling it.<br>  <br>  Get the proper help at the dealer or a GOOD independent mechanic, and do it right.  If you had to ask this question, you cannot do this yourself.  Do it right, and it will be fixed for a long, long time.<br>  <br>  My advice is good, I know Rovers.  You will be tempted to let others lead you to believe that it can be fixed for a few dollars.  This is NOT the case.  If you pay to have it done, you are looking to pay at LEAST 2000 dollars.  Most places will end up being more.  That isn't just Rover price, either.  Head gaskets on a vehicle with a V8 built after 1996 and the new emissions standards are always expensive.<br>  <br>  For the purposes of clarity, that is coolant you are putting in, with anti-freeze mixed in with it.  Anti-freeze is simply an additive designed to prevent coolant from freezing in extreme conditions.
lsme2OPpaa	loveaddict15, For car insurance the fastest way to get a low quote is do a policy comparison. If you choose the same coverage levels, you can get an accurate quote to compare against others.

Sales and reliablity are so bad that GM is trying to sell the Hummer brand to some other company. After months of trying, no other company has come forward, and the brand may disappear. So, if you buy a Hummer now and take good care of it, it'll be a collector's item in about 25 years.|`|9nQQaax2aa	Well there could by something wrong with it that they are hiding<br>  but hummers have awful gas mileage so that could be why they are trying to get rid of it.|`|y5WaOXobaa	i have to agree with them one reason is because of gas also because they might kill hummer and parts might get expencive for them idk just a guess on that one.|`|SUVgk39Haa	maybe it is because they feel sorry for you when you pull that cheap hummer up to the gas pumps to fill it up..|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	Very hard on fuel.

r1D9P4Vyaa	Yes most likely the park shift interlock but I don`t think it`s the solenoid. I could be wrong though. I am sure you looked at the fuses so try looking at the brake switch area. I don`t remember if that model had 2 switch`s or not. One was for the brake lights and the other for the interlock. Check to see if the switch has continuity or not when you push the brake pedal. Also there should be a over ride on it, you will have to look in the owners manual on how to get it out of park until you get this figured out. I wish I could see the car to better help you but it`s been awhile for me on that year Toyota. Good Luck.

3MTYGEbWaa	No, if you know you will buy the truck at lease-end, it's always cheaper to simply buy up front, not lease. It's not that you pay more for the truck (you don't) but you pay a LOT more in finance charges.<br>  <br>  The only reason some people do a lease-then-purchase is that payments are lower and more affordable for the first few years during the lease, but then increase later (after the purchase) when their finances are better -- even though they know they'll be paying more overall in finance charges this way.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	If you're confident that you like the truck, drive more than 15-20K per year, it will fit your needs now AND in the future AND will keep it for many years, recognize you'll be paying for tires, brakes, etc. down the road, BUY.<br>  If you you have the habit of trading every 2-3 years, drive less than 15-20K a year, may face a change in your life style, don't like to be faced with buying tires, brakes, etc., LEASE.  View a lease as a 2-3 year test drive to insure the vehicle is right for you.  In that time, things may change.  You may decide you want a 4X4 rather than 4X2, you might need to pull heavier loads & need a bigger engine/truck or visa versa, you may want a Crew Cab vs a Super Cab, you might need a car in the future rather than a truck,...<br>  Examine the buy vs lease option closely.  Sometimes there may be little difference monetarily should you exercise the purchase option at the end of a lease.|`|hg8ExtsNaa	leasing is a great if you dont intend to put a ton of miles on it and you can get a tax right off..ie ..using for business purposes..<br>  I like the idea though of buyin a vehicle and runnin er to the ground..<br>  seems cheaper to me..now adays most dealers are reluctant to lease<br>  you can get a loan now and carry it over 72 months with low interest that can really drop your payments..buy a domestic..keep the jobs at home..good luck ..safe cruisin..

PkC1Sk8Qaa	I live in Adelaide Australia. Test wasn't hard at all. You should read the book through but really the book is just so you know the actual rules and technicalities whilst you are actually driving, its not the best method for passing the test.<br>  <br>  If you wanna ace the test then you need to go onto the government site and take practice test. You can do this online as many times as you like and these are the exact questions as you will face on the test. It will tell you which ones were right, which ones were wrong and the correct answers in all cases. Basically you can learn and memorize the correct answer to every question and pass easily. <br>  <br>  The test consists of two parts, a 20 question Give Way Test and a 40 question multiple choice test. You have to get 20 out of 20 for give way, so make sure you know those back to front. You can afford to get some wrong on the Multiple Choice however.

Zlzdo2yoaa	A savage title means that the car has been deemed a total loss from an accident, flood or other cause and in most states cannot be titled or driven on public roadways. In other words it is for scrap or parting out only. There are some ways around this though...for instance you take a car from one state with a salvage and repair it in another state and get a "good" or rebuilt title and drive it again. A lot of shady car dealers will do this with flood cars and resell them without disclosing the prior damage to the new owner. Getting a CARFAX doesn't always help because reporting to carfax is voluntary and lot of repair shops don't bother reporting repairs and insurance companys are not required to report either.|`|Au2aI9a2aa	This means that the cars title will have a salvaged placed onto it.

z9ey2Uqkaa	Its not illegal, but the car would still legally belong to you, and you would be liable for anything that happens with it, i.e. if it strikes a pedestrian, if its used in a robbery, if its part of a hit and run, if its found abandoned, if it accrues parking tickets, etc.  Now you will have the bill of sale to say you sold it, but you are going to have to tell that to a judge and explain why you didn't transfer title, and even then you still might be responsible because you never transferred it.<br>  This guy is up to something shady, lose his phone number.|`|EmgiGg17aa	I think he want to put his own price on it(to pay less tax on it).

That's another thing about here in Texas, the last registered owner is responsible for bad things done with a motor vehicle.<br>  <br>  For example, IF the car remains registered to you, and is involved in a bank robbery, the FBI is going to come visit YOU!!!!   Years ago that happened to me.

The trick is not to scare people by looking like some kind of nut.|`|iqMPvr7Taa	No fill it It as it says.

If the person runs illegal tags on it or commits a crime with it and the police confiscate the car they will come looking for you as you are still the last registered owner.

The reason a person don't want the title filled in is for many reasons such as they don't plan on titling the vehicle for awhile ( some states charge a penalty for titling a vehicle over 30 days after purchase), or they plan on reselling the car for more money. If they resell the car they can make all kinds of guarantees or even offer a full warranty for which you the last registered owner will and can be held liable for. Their name is not on any paperwork so they get the money and get to walk away so fill out the title.|`|Tb91H3D9aa	I'm not actually sure of the answer, but here's a potential situation: the buyer filling it out with your name again and going on a hit-and-run spree over the most populated sidewalks of the city.  That's just what I get from it, though.  Maybe it's not quite as easy as it sounds.

Also checking that there getting 12 volts is another place to start.|`|k55p1pKraa	Unplug the wire from the glow plug ,now hook your test light up to the hot side of the battery take the other end of the test light and touch it to the middle of the glow plug, the test light should light up if it's good, your test light wont light up if the glow plug is bad. If all your glow plugs check out to be good , you might wont to check the glow solenoid, it like just like a starter solenoid.

xLZGbS9Yaa	I learned a trick from my engine's instructor, when I went to Lincoln Technical Institute. I mention it in step 3 of my eHow article: <br>  How to Tune-Up a Car Yourself<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4692646_tuneup-car-yourself.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4692646_tuneup-c...</a>|`|5xxuKzXPaa	carbon build up would create nox in the exhaust NOT smoke. if it is blue smoke then replace the pcv valve or look into a set of rings but you said that compression was high so rings should not be the problem. i have done that trick on my car also to an extent, but you should drop the cat to keep from plugging it up with the carbon that you will be removing from the engine. that and use some pvc pipe ( i had some laying around that worked very well.) and a camping stove and a tea kettle. the steam will allow more moisture to get into the troubled spots. i started out at 190 psi and it dropped to 145 which is well within specs for that engine.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	I doubt carbon build up is a concern with your engine. <br>  Generally, excessive carbon build up means hard starting and engine pinging.<br>  However, if you insist, buy some decarbonizing chemical made for this purpose and simply follow the directions on the can.|`|SVY4JXwCaa	I'm not an expert in carbon problems, BUT, if there is a lot of carbon accumulating in the engine you could sell it to a paper company to make carbon copy paper with.<br>   -OR-<br>  In the old days we used to remove the air filter and VERY SLOWLY add a very SMALL amount of water (about 6 ounces) to the carb or throttle body while holding the throttle about 1/4 open (accelerated) to keep the engine from stalling. Allow the engine to continue to run AS NORMAL AT LEAST 10 minutes after. This can be done often if needed. The water expands in the cylinder and helps remove the build up.
lZsbIEo8aa	Recreation vehicles are exempt from CDL regulations, PROVIDED THAT the vehicle is being used for recreation purposes only. No matter what size or configuration the vehicle is.<br>  <br>  If you use the RV and transport product or supplies, say for your side business, (antiques for resale, parts for repair shop, or craft supplies for your basketmaking business), then you are subject to all the CDL regulations - same as a large truck.|`|iosLyJcKaa	This answer depends on your state. Federal Rules give states the option to waive CDL requirements for vehicles used for recreational purposes. Most states do waive CDL requirements for RV'S. However most of these states require a special class of license or special endorsement on your license to drive a recreational vehicle. So even though most states exempt large RV drivers from needing a CDL, most states still require you to take a special driving test to get a special endorsement or  to upgrade to a special class of license to drive them. It is best to check with the motor vehicle department for the state you reside in.|`|ebJ02QZJaa	I don't believe that you do.  You don't have to have one to drive any of the large moving vans.|`|GIFCh6Ccaa	it depends on the size and usage.<br>  <br>  anything used for commercial purposes requires a CDL.  anything that carries paying passengers requires a CDL. any vehicle that carries more than 15 people requires a CDL.  any vehicle with a gross combined weight over 26,001 requires a CDL.  yes, some of the largest RV's require a CDL.

YX4y4vCfaa	It's probably your breaks. They have a piece of steal in them that hits the wheel as they wear down to let you know. For about $40 you can get a pair of pads and their very easy to replace yourself but if mechanical skills are not an attribute you posses just take it to a mechanic. It could be a worn belt but I doubt it. If you do change them yourself remember to PUMP YOUR BREAKS ALLOT BEFORE YOU START DRIVING OR YOU MAY NOT HAVE ANY.<br>  <br>  1. jack up the car and remove the tire.<br>  2. you should be able to see the pads on either side of the router. Pry them out with a bar so you can unclasp them. Note this will/may take allot of strength. There should be a little flat clip or something that comes off quite easily.<br>  3. Replace with new pads.<br>  4. Change the other side.<br>  5. All said and done. Start your car, pump the breaks many times, drive Slow a ways and test them a few times.<br>  6.

wpg6zTMQaa	You can't legally sell them the car without transferring the title. Anyone can get insurance on a car they drive.|`|SuZbBnycaa	No. You can't make your bank approve your family member, and make them part of your loan. <br>  What you could do, is ask the bank (since they hold the title and are the legal owners of your car) ask the bank to add your family members name to the title ( the your names  listed "AND" and not "OR". So it's Me AND jimmybob, not Me OR jimmybob.)<br>  Then tell your insurance company of the change.<br>  Of course this doesn't release you of any liability or responsibility.<br>  The bank and insurance company never question who paid the payment.<br>  Forget the bill of sale. You are not selling your car. Unless you can pay the lien off in full.|`|84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	You can sell it, however, you can't sell the loan.  So, you have to sell it for enough to pay off the loan, and write a bill of sale stating the vehicle is free and clear of liens.  You can only issue this bill of sale when you have received CERTIFIED payment, made out jointly to yourself and the bank holding the lien.  If the person wants to make payment, he has to get his own loan to pay directly the bank holding your lien.|`|dyIyJqauaa	You should not let someone "take over payments".  You would still be the legal owner of the car and would have to carry the insurance.  If anything happened to the car while the other person was driving you would still be fully responsible.  Besides all of that, a car with a lien cannot be sold to anyone  Your family member should simply buy the car from you, get their own loan, title and insure it in their name.|`|GtBOQPKqaa	Essentially, you want your family member to assume the payments. To do this, they would have to apply to the bank to do so.
