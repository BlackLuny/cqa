AA10655250	The Los Angeles River.    The Los Angeles River starts in San Fernando Valley, San Gabriel Mountains, and Santa Susana Mountains and flows through Los Angeles County, California, from Canoga Park in the west end of the San Fernando Valley, 51 miles or 82 kilometers southeast to its mouth in Long Beach. Several tributaries join the once free flowing and frequently flooding river, forming alluvial flood plains along its banks. It now flows through a concrete channel on a fixed course.    For additional information and a list of Southern California rivers, see the links below.

Hexane is nonpolar and immiscible with water - it will float on top. Br2 is nonpolar and thus much more soluble in a nonpolar solvent like hexane than it is in water. The bromine will be transferred to the hexane phase, which will turn reddish-brown from the bromine. The water will become lighter in color.

X0e6p9Ilaa	Bohr was in Manchester, England with E. Rutherford about the same time as Rutherford published the paper on the nuclear atom.    "... (he) went to England in September 1911 to study with Sir J J Thomson at Cambridge. He had intended to spend his entire study period in Cambridge but he did not get on well with Thomson so, after a meeting with Ernest Rutherford in Cambridge in December 1911, Bohr moved to the Victoria University, Manchester (now the University of Manchester) in March 1912. The timing was very fortuitous since shortly before Bohr and Rutherford met, Rutherford had published a major work showing that the bulk of the mass of an atom resided in the nucleus."    "On 24 July 1912, with his paper still unfinished, Bohr left Rutherford's group in Manchester and returned to Copenhagen to continue to develop his new theory of the atom, completing the work in 1913. The same year he published three papers of fundamental importance on the theory of atomic structure. The first paper was on the hydrogen atom, the next two on the structure of atoms heavier than hydrogen."    From:  http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~hist...

Q6uWCUqsaa	Consider a vertical cross section of the cup. For all times t > 0, the water in this cross section forms an isosceles triangle that is similar to the triangle formed by the cup. (This is obvious from a sketch.)    Therefore,    2r/h = 2R/H = 1.1/1.5 = 11/15    Therefore, for all t > 0,     r = 11h/15    At times t > 0 (until the cup empties), the volume V of water in the cup is given by    V = (/3)r2h    You are given the values of dV/dt and are asked to find dh/dt when h=1. So use the relationship derived above between r and h to get V in terms of h only:    V = (/3)(11h/15)2h = (121/675)h3    Now, by the chain rule,    dV/dt = (dV/dh) (dh/dt)    so     dh/dt = (dV/dt) / (dV/dh)    Compute dV/dh, evaluate it at h=1, and use the given dV/dt = -0.3.    dh/dt

Say  it lost it's tilt at the tropic of cancer, that in effect would become the new equator , and the present day equator would be in a permanent spring and the tropic of capicorn would be in a permanent winter.    If it stayed at that latitude, there would be no more alternating seasons. You would get only one season. And it would probably become a more exaggerated season since the ocean currents would also stop flowing the way they are (since the migration of the sun heats the oceans at different rates depending on latitude of the sun.    So I'd say within a year, whereever the sun stopped, at that latitude the temperature would start slowly climbing and at this new equator it would probably get upwards of 200F and all plant life would die, and likewise the areas farthest from the sun, which used to have a normal winter , would get continually colder and drop off to around -200F    The tilting of the axis of the earth is the best distribution of heat and cold there is, without it there is no distribution of heat and cold...and that sounds bad|`|O71xlcG3aa	I think if the earth went off its axis that we might float away into space right?  cause of the gravitational pull and what not?|`|70cf63c745874c449067b760725961e9aa	I suppose what you mean by"if the earth lost its tilt' is that the axis will become perpendicular to the orbital plane of the earth around the sun.In such a case,duration of day time and night time will become equal in all the places (probably except in polar regions) of the earth throughout the year.If so,the sun will be shining vertically over the equator always(the equator will always be near the sun) and the equatorial regions will become more hotter.There will be no seasons as the apparent north-south movement of the sun will no longer be there.The polar regions may become more colder as the sun's rays will reach the poles almost parallel to the surface and thereby not heating the surface at all even though the sunlight will be available there throughout the year at reduced intensity.|`|XzhdKsPlaa	No seasons, but hotter and very bad tropical storms with London disappearing under water, so not such a bad thing after all !!|`|7hAT9iLQaa	I think that there wouldnt be seasons.  the top half would probably be cooler than the lower part of the hemisphere. besides tons of climate change, i dunno what else... dont think we'd float out in space because if i remember correctly, the tilt has more to do with climates and seasons...

Now assume we can only take the train.  There are 4 trains in the morning and 3 at night.

b1a356a171cfdc067007281982717464aa	Let's use the example of 405,000.    To write in scientific notation, first put a decimal point where it belongs...    405,000 becomes 405,000.      Then move the decimal point over to the left until it can't go any farther without making a less-than-one number. Count the number of times you move it...in this case, that would be five. That number of times you moved the decimal point is the exponent for the scientific notation.    4.05 x 10^5      The same thing works when doing scientific notation of numbers that are already less than one.    For example, 0.08206    Move the decimal point over to the RIGHT until it creates a number GREATER than one.  The number of times you move it over will be the exponent - except, because you're moving the point to the RIGHT, the exponent is negative.    0.08206 becomes 8.206 x 10^ -2       Scientific notation is actually really easy.  Just count the number of times you move the decimal point over.  If you're moving it to the left, the exponent that goes with the 10 is positive.  If you're moving it to the right, the exponent that goes with the 10 is negative.|`|hbg16yqdaa	hey there is a hot website and it's algebrahelp.com. i would really recommend for you to go there trust me you learn everything from algebra very fast.|`|jGtR6It4aa	The number that the 10 is raised to is the number of decimal points we need to move and in which direction (+ = right, - = left). For example; 3.21*10^2 means we move the decimal point 2 places to the right to produce 321. Another example, 3.21*10^(-2) means we move the decimal point 2 places to the left to produce 0.0321.|`|qyy3K51Jaa	Example:  10000.  in scientific notation, you'd take the decimal at the end (if there is no decimal, then, make one) OR at the begining (ex: .0001) and you move it over until only 1 number is left on the side you are moving to.  Thus, 10000. would be: 1. (and .0001 would be .1) and then, you count how many spots you moved over, and stick that number with 10, in order to "raise 10 to the power of ___".  So, back to the example, 10000. turned into 1. and we moved over (to the left) 4 spots, so, the answer would be,   1. x 10 ^4 (10 raised to the 4th power)    However, with the example .0001 which was .1, the answer would be,  .1 x 10^-3 (10 raised to -3rd power)  The reason that it is negitive, is because you had to go to the right, or, if you pay attention, you are moving the decimal backwards, where, when we moved the decimal to the left, you are moving it foward (which makes it positive)    I hope I helped, but, I probably just confused you more. Hope that I didn't though!

I don't exaggerate when I say that one of my friends who's mother sent him a hot water bottle found it frozen solid at the bottom of his bed.    There wasn't all that much snow but I can still remember the cold forty six years later.    I also remember the previous coldest winter in 1947 when I was five, and all the school milk left outside froze and cracked the little milk bottles.
Wp6rQVJzaa	Are you going to the University of Maryland?  I did my BS in EE there 10 years ago and had to make the same choice with the same classes and class numbers.      I took 461, 462 and some other linear algebra class.  It all depends on your area in EE.  I work in digital design, firmware and DSP.  I'll occasionally see a linear algebra question come up.      I liked the partial differential class because it was by far the most interesting math class I took.      If the area you specialize in needs one of these, take that one.  Otherwise I thought 462 was the most interesting.|`|zwNaZbKlaa	You go to CP don't you? Ya I'm a sophomore EE major. I took MATH240, which is intro to linear algebra and the advising people at AV Williams said that was good enough to complete my 4xx level.    If you haven't taken linear algebra already I suggest taking MATH461. It is really helpful because a lot of the stuff you learn in there has EE applications.    If you are only going to choose between 462 and 463 I would choose 462 since I find it more fun.     Have you taken ENEE206? I need help on my pre-lab questions!!! Email me please!!

So, just divide all of the people up and see how many groups of 8 there are (1600/8=200), and then just multiply the number of groups by the number of people of each gender in each group. 200*3=600 guys, and 200*5=1000 girls, so there are 400 more girls than guys.

Its the same.    If there are 24 hours in a day. And 60 minutes in an hour....  60*24=1440 hours.|`|oZiv28Iraa	Okay, this is a simple comparison.    You have 3 clocks, let's call them CORRECT, FAST, and SLOW    CORRECT CLOCK  -This clock is always right, it never gains time or loses time. This will be the clock you compare the others against. It will never fluctuate and always read the correct time (it's a static variable).    SLOW CLOCK  -The slow clock is losing a minute each day, therefore the time it reads is "behind schedule" (SLOWER THAN CORRECT CLOCK).    FAST CLOCK  -The fast clock is not patient, it likes to add a minute everyday and therefore is giving a time that is "ahead of schedule" (faster than CORRECT CLOCK).    So let's compare them:    CORRECT CLOCK - Reads 12 Noon ALWAYS    SLOW CLOCK - At the start it reads 12 noon (the target time) but it loses a minute daily.    There are 24 hours in a day, and each hour is 60 minutes.  This means there are 24 * 60 minutes in a day, which = 1440 minutes.    So here's what SLOW CLOCK does at noon each day...  Day 1 - Reads Noon 12:00  Day 2 - Reads 11:59  Day 3 - Reads 11:58  Day 4 - Reads 11:57    FAST CLOCK does just the opposite  Day 1 - Reads 12:00 @ noon  Day 2 - Reads 12:01  Day 3 - Reads 12:02    and so on....    Because this is a 24 hour clock you must treat the problem as an entire day (most clocks just go around on 12 hours unless it's digital and shows AM and PM)    So for these clocks EVER to match each other again, SLOW clock needs to lose 1440 minutes, and FAST clock needs to gain 1440 minutes. Once they each do this, there will be one day in the future where ALL THREE read 12 noon at 12 noon once again.    So your answer is simple, multiply 1440 days (one minute lost or gained each day) by 24 hours (since the answer requested is in hours)    (1440 DAILY CYCLES of LOSS or GAIN) x (1 minute lost or gained PER day) x (24 hours PER 1 day)    = 34,560 HOURS untl they match again (3.94 years)    Good Luck!    I'm pretty sure that's the answer but you may want to consider the final cycle, because 1439 might be an answer the teacher accepts depending how you read the problem, which makes the answer 32,536.  This sounds like an assessment, it's your thought process that counts.
qq5nceCXaa	It differs in the selective pressure.      The unnatural selection of the breeder uses their judgment as to what's best, mainly with a future goal in mind.  In natural selection all that matters is what's best right now in getting offspring.    We already have breeds that sit on the boundaries, such as mud skippers so why do we need to selectively breed?    The other issue is that in both natural selection and selective breeding the variation has to be present for the change to occur.  Unless you start doing gene manipulation you run out of available variation in a selective breeding program long before you get to speciation.  You also risk emphasizing detrimental traits as well as your selection process is blind to them.|`|16vMIGPiaa	Selective breeding is very much like the natural selection process.  In the case of selective breeding, the 'survival' characteristic is determined by the human cultivators.    However, you have mixed two concepts here.  Evolution also depends on spontaneous mutations that when passed on yield increased odds of survival.  These sorts of mutations are not historically controllable.  With the advent of genetic manipulation, however, they can be created.

An element is a substance that cannot be divided or changed into different substances by ordinary chemistry methods.  For instance you cannot further divide an atom of Helium into any other substance.  Matter on the other hand is something that has mass and exists as either a solid, liquid, gas or plasma.  All elements in their natural state exist as one of these forms of matter.  An example is the element, Oxygen, which exists as a gas at room temperature.|`|igvjt2TBaa	Unlike chemical compounds, elements cannot be broken down into simpler substances by ordinary heat, light, electricity, or chemical reactions.

In fact, you can find any multiple.  The reason we used to find the "least" common multiple is because we did not have calculators.

V4fEgYIQaa	DNA replicates during the interphase stage of mitosis.... The prupose of mitosis is to copy cells to pass on to daughter cells. The purpose of meiosis is to produce gametes (eggs and sperm) for reproduction. In meiosis one, pairs of homologous pairs (tetrads) are split into just homologous pairs (a dyad) in meiosis two, they are further split from dyads into monads (chromatids). So DNA doesn't have to replicate in meiosis. It just divides or reuces information it already has to make more gametes. It's in mitosis that there is replication for daughter cells.

AVDTZ63Oaa	You aren't going to like this...    Snow is clear.    The refraction of light bouncing around inside the crystal matrix for thousands of miles makes it come out scattered in to it's component wavelengths.    Snow is NOT white. Snow LOOKS white, because the absorption of light through the crystals is essentially random.|`|AsKWImpQaa	Snow is made up of lots of little tiny particles that scatter light, but don't absorb very much of it. When light enters into snow it gets scattered this way and that, and then finally re-emerges in a direction that is completely unrelated to the direction it went in, but with very little decrease in intensity (because the absorption is small). So snow is like a very good reflector (like a mirror) because most of the light that hits it comes back out, but is unlike a good reflector it doesn't change the direction of the light in a simple way, so it is not "shiny." That is what makes it white: the light that goes in comes back out, but not in the same direction.    You can find a quite technical discussion of it in the paper "Multiple scattering of light and some of its observable consequences" by Craig Bohren in the June 1987 American Journal of Physics, pp. 524-533.|`|i5FP4Vbraa	Snow is mostly made of water which is colourless, thus snow has no colour = white.

All that you have to do to tell if something is a function is get a straight object, hold it vertically and move it over the equation. If at any point the pencil comes in contact with more than one point of the line at the same time, it is not a function.    That method is very useful for visual problems, but with your problem you can just picture it.    For example, in the first points you listed, you have (0,0),(0,1). Just by these two points you can tell that it isn't a function because if you ran a pencil vertically across this line, it would hit both of these points as both of their x-values equal 0.    To sum it all up, if you have any x-values that are the same, it's not a function.

Wagcdklxaa	Let    x = inhabitants with 3 extremities  y = inhabitants with 4 extremities    Equation 1 -- 3x + 4y = 173    Equation 2 -- x + y = 51    From Equation 2, y = (51 - x) and substituting this into Equation 1,    3x + 4(51 - x) = 173    Simplifying the above,    3x + 204 - 4x = 173    4x - 3x = 204 - 173    x = 31    and solving for "y" (Using Equation 2),    y = 51 - 31    y = 20      ANSWER:    Inhabitants with 3 extremities = 31  Inhabitants with 4 extremities = 20      CHECK:     31 *3 + 20 * 4 = 93 + 80 = 173 extremities    Hope this helps.|`|STI2L7ojaa	Okay, so let's call the number of people with 3 extremities x, and the ones with 4 are y.    The total   of extremities is 173, so:    3x + 4y = 173    There are 51 faces, so 51 people total, so:    x + y = 51    Rearrange the second equation to get:    x = 51 - y    and substitute it into the first equation:    3(51-y) + 4y = 173    151 - 3y + 4y = 173    y = 20    Find x with the second equation again:    x + 20 = 51    so x= 31    Answer: 31 people have 3 extremities, and 20 people have 4 extremities.

When talking about Watts with electric motors, we are referring to the INPUT power. When talking about Horsepower, we are talking about shaft power or OUTPUT power. The difference between them is the efficiency of the motor. Without knowing the efficiency it is somewhat hard to convert.

ynjrtIdUaa	A percent is a fraction of 100.  So, in order to have a decimal you would need to divide the number by 100.  So, just move the decimal point 2 places to the right.  So, if 1 meter is .5%, then 1 meter is .005 of the actual length.  So, .005 is to 1 meter as 100% is to the actual length (.005 /1 = 1/x), looking for x (the actual length).  By cross multiplication .005x = 1.  I will let you finish this problem.    Also 20% of $1500 would be 20 out of every 100 or $1500 x .2.  Again you can finish the calculation.

If you are a plant and are depending on animals to pollinate you, what happens if the animals die off or go somewhere else to live? Do you just die out in one generation because there is nothing to polinate you?    Mmmm. Good ol' tubers! Root, hog, or die! Plants that grow edible tubers are at a disadvantage to animals that dig up and eat those tubers.    Both sexes on the the same flower? Can you spell "incest" as in Auntie Mom and Uncle Dad? Not real good for diversity of the species to have both sexes on the same plant.    Still, many plants work that way and most farmers wouldn't have it any other way. Corn, for example, has the male part on the top and the female part in the ears. Makes the corn easy to pollinate with that particular arrangement: all you need is a strong breeze and male pollen comes raining down on the female tassles.|`|AA12272885	Animal pollinators may be unreliable  if there are none in the near vicinity.    A disadvantage of a plant having tubers is that they tend to rot if the soil is moist, and can also become infested with grubs or other larva (roots and tubers are not the same).    If both stamen and pistil are in the same flower it may self-pollinate which does not create a new mixture of traits that may lead to advantageous characteristics.
0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	2012 is the last year in the last Mayan calendar produced.  They either didn't believe things would continue after that, or they simply put aside the task of setting up the next calendar until the time got closer to the end of the current one.  I'm opting for the latter explanation, in which case the world will definitely not end in 2012.  Even if the former explanation were the case, that was only their belief, and beliefs are not necessarily factual.

AA10306863	Being at the top of a food web generally means you are the biggest and the baddest for miles around. This is very rare because no matter how tough you are there is always someone tougher. Take for example, the polar bear. Apex predator is what they call that officially. But when it goes for a swim if a killer whale sees one and is hungry is is all over for the bear.     Mother Nature didn't make that many of the fiercest, most intelligent and highly organized animals over and over. Another term they use is a keystone species, like a wolf. The health of the ecosystem often depends on the health of the top predator. Most animals want to fit in a niche. Exploit resources that no other animal exploits so there is less competition. This drive to survive doesn't always include the animal becoming the biggest and baddest for miles around but the most equipped to survive.
0DwHIBUbaa	Q1 simply needs an application of Newton's first law. You have values for 'F' (nett force, after taking away the resistances from the road, is 270N) and for 'm'(car and caravan 1800kg) so plug these into the equation and solve for 'a'.    For Q2 treat the car and caravan as two points joined by a line representing the tow-bar. Add vectors to the car and to the caravan for the forces. The forward force vector on these is bigger than their resistance because they are accelerating and (F - f) = ma. The car has drag and the van has impulse, from the tow-bar as well as their respective resistances. Then calculate the vector along the tow-bar to balance the van and note that this balances the car too if the answer is correct!.    Now you're on a roll, and should be able to do the rest by yourself! Q3 is like Q2 but the force of the drive has gone and negative acceleration forces are determined only by the resistances. Q4 has an extra acceleration back into the problem so it will be similar to Q2

He2WsvBcaa	True:   b) The metallic elements have similar properties: they conduct electricity well, are ductile and have high densities.  This is very true, although the alkali metals have low densities and can float on water; nevertheless, the alkali metals are a relatively small portion of the elements.    Why?    a) False, because most of the elements are metals.    c) False, because nonmetals come in 3 different phases of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. As with metals, they are all solids with the notable exception of mercury, Hg, which is a liquid.    d)False, because helium is not diatomic. These elements are diatomic in nature: hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, bromine, chlorine, iodine. The chemical symbols are H, N, O, F, Br, Cl, I    e) False, because only 2 elements of the total 117 exist as liquids in nature. They are mercury, Hg (a metal), and bromine, Br (a nonmetal).
5LIBkdpWaa	first off density = mass divided by volume    and the sig digs    Identifying significant digits    The rules for identifying significant digits when writing or interpreting numbers are as follows:        * All non-zero digits are considered significant. Example: 1, 20, and 300 all have one significant figure. Their significant figures are 1, 2, and 3 respectively. 123.45 has five significant figures: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.      * Zeros appearing anywhere between two non-zero digits are significant. Example: 101.12 has five significant figures: 1, 0, 1, 1 and 2.      * Leading zeros are not significant. For example, 0.00012 has two significant figures: 1 and 2.      * Trailing zeros in a number containing a decimal point are significant. For example, 12.2300 has six significant figures: 1, 2, 2, 3, 0 and 0. The number 0.000122300 still has only six significant figures (the zeros before the 1 are not significant). In addition, 120.00 has five significant figures. This convention clarifies the precision of such numbers; for example, if a result accurate to four decimal places is given as 12.23 then it might be understood that only two decimal places of accuracy are available. Stating the result as 12.2300 makes clear that it is accurate to four decimal places.      * The significance of trailing zeros in a number not containing a decimal point can be ambiguous. For example, it may not always be clear if a number like 1300 is accurate to the nearest unit (and just happens coincidentally to be an exact multiple of a hundred) or if it is only shown to the nearest hundred due to rounding or uncertainty. Various conventions exist to address this issue:            * A bar may be placed over the last significant digit; any trailing zeros following this are insignificant. For example, 13\bar{0}0 has three significant figures (and hence indicates that the number is accurate to the nearest ten).            * The last significant figure of a number may be underlined; for example, "20000" has two significant figures.            * A decimal point may be placed after the number; for example "100." indicates specifically that three significant figures are meant.[1]        However, these conventions are not universally used, and it is often necessary to determine from context whether such trailing zeros are intended to be significant. If all else fails, the level of rounding can be specified explicitly. The abbreviation s.f. is sometimes used, for example "20 000 to 2 s.f." or "20 000 (2 sf)". Alternatively, the uncertainty can be stated separately and explicitly, as in 20 000  1%, so that significant-figures rules do not apply.    A number with all zero digits (e.g. 0.000) has no significant digits, because the uncertainty is larger than the actual measurement.          - wikipedia    now compare to lead and done.|`|R7kk39sTaa	3.40 x 10^-4 pm x (1 m / 10^12 pm) x (10^2 cm / 1 m) = 3.4 x 10^-14 cm    V = 4/3 (3.14159) x (1.7 x 10^-14 cm)^3 = 2.06 x 10^-41 cm^3    d = m / V = 4.70 x 10^-24 g / 2.06 x 10^-41 cm^3 = 2.28 x 10^17 g/cm^3!!

LztcTxkBaa	NOW, when solving word problems, if the question says ' the sum of'. Whatever is written after that should be put in brackets.    for example, in number 1, we have 'the sum of THREE TIMES THE NUMBER AND FOUR'. so it will be (3x+4)    just as in number two, we'll have (x+4) and (x+7)    after dealing with the sums and subtractions, we deal with the multiplying factor of the brackets.    for example, in number 2, we have 'three times the sum of'  this will be interpreted as 3(x+7)    after doing these two important things, you can add the other minor details.    for example, in number 2, we have 'decreased by 4'  this will then be added outside the bracket and not within as you have done. once the bracket is closed, leave it closed.  this will be interpreted as 3(x+7) - 4    another way of putting this is: WHY DIDN'T THE QUESTION JUST SAY THREE TIMES THE SUM OF THE NUMBER AND THREE. thinking in this line could also help you!    so, the solution to the questions are  1. X     multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction     4X     4X-3X     X  2. 2(X+4) is less than or equal to 3(X+7) - 4      2X + 8 is less than or equal to 3X + 21 - 4      2X + 8 is less than or equal to 3X + 17      8 - 17 is less than or equal to 3X - 2X      -9 is less than or equal to X  OR X is greater than or equal to -9    HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|vNBYAIZLaa	your right with the equations

You first need to find the volume of the two cubes.  The volume of one of the cubes is 10^3 or 1000 cm^3.  Multiply that by two since you have 2 cubes.  So, both cubes together have a volume of 2000 cm^3.  Now you need to find the volume of the sphere.  The volume of a sphere is (4/3)*pi*r^3.  (r is the radius of the sphere).  Since the radius here is 5, the volume of one sphere is 524 cm^3.  Now, just divide 2000/524 to get 3.8.    You can only make 3 complete spheres from these cubes|`|XscVe0AYaa	Well you need to find volume here.    Two blocks of clay with edges of 10cm...it says that they are cubes so the volume is simply 10x10x10cm (length*width*height) or 1,000 cm^3...then you have two of them so that's 2,000 cm^3 of clay to work with.    ***I used the wrong formula for spheres...I was using surface area, not volume.  Volume is (4/3)*Pi*r^3, so I corrected it below.***    So we're looking to make spheres with a radius of 5 cm...we know that the volume formula for spheres is (4/3)*Pi*r^3...plug in 5 cm for the radius r since that is given, and we have 523.3 cm^3 per sphere.  That's how much clay a sphere with radius 5 cm will take to form.    So since we have 2,000 cubic cm of clay, and each sphere takes 523.3 cubic cm, simply divide the sphere volume into the amount of clay we have and round down.  2000/523.3 = 3.82, so we can make 3 full spheres of radius 5 cm.

JUmfm168aa	Hello Becca,    The expected value is better known as the mean.    It is simply the sum of the elements multiplied by their probabilities.    In this case: E(X) = (1 * 2/6) + (0 * 4/6) = 2/6 = 1/3.    The expected value is exactly as you had calculated.    The variance is slightly more complicated. You have to square each element, and multiply by it's probability of occurrance, then subtract the mean squared.    So: Var(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2 = (1^2 * 2/6) + (0^2 * 4/6) - (1/3)^2.    Thus: Var(X) = 2/6 + 0 - 1/9 = 3/9 - 1/9 = 2/9.
AA10277342	Given:  V = lim x->0  (1+x)^(1/x)    Take the natural log of both sides:  ln(V) = ln(lim x->0   (1+x)^(1/x))    I'm not completely sure of the legitimacy of this  step, but I am claiming that "the log of the limit"  is the same as "the limit of the log":  ln(V) = lim x->0 ln((1+x)^(1/x))    Bring down the exponent of the log:  ln(V) = lim x->0 (1/x) * ln(1+x)    Rewrite as a fraction:  ln(V) = lim x->0 ln(1+x) / x    Since the numerator and denominator both go to zero  as x goes to zero, we can apply L'Hospitals rule.  Note that d/dx of ln(x+1) = 1/(x+1) :  ln(V) = lim x->0 (1/(1+x)) / (1)  ln(V) = lim x->0 (1/(1+x))    Now take the limit:  ln(V) = (1/(1+0))  ln(V) = 1/1  ln(V) = 1    Take the antilog of each side:  V = e    Thus, the value of (1+x)^(1/x) as x goes to 0 is "e".        To make a quick check if this at least makes sense,  evaluate f(x) = (1+x)^(1/x) for values approaching 0.  Note that the value of "e" is roughly 2.718281828    ?????????????????x??????????f(x)   1.000000000000 2.000000000000   0.100000000000 2.593742460100   0.010000000000 2.704813829422   0.001000000000 2.716923932236   0.000100000000 2.718145926825   0.000010000000 2.718268237192   0.000001000000 2.718280469096   0.000000100000 2.718281694132   0.000000010000 2.718281798347   0.000000001000 2.718282052012   0.000000000100 2.718282053235   0.000000000010 2.718282053357   0.000000000001 2.718523496037    -0.000000000001 2.718221696056  -0.000000000010 2.718282053384  -0.000000000100 2.718282053507  -0.000000001000 2.718281752940  -0.000000010000 2.718281855709  -0.000000100000 2.718281962942  -0.000001000000 2.718283187679  -0.000010000000 2.718295419980  -0.000100000000 2.718417755010  -0.001000000000 2.719642216443  -0.010000000000 2.731999026429  -0.100000000000 2.867971990792    It does appear that the expression is tending  toward the value of "e".      .

N0UUmjDlaa	Well, it takes energy to generate power. Mechanical energy, for example, might be generated by passing water downhill through a turbine, which drives the generator of electrical power.  Thermal energy can also be used to power electrical generators by producing steam (various fossil fuels, or by nuclear fission), or by utilisation of fuels of various types in internal combustion engines.   Thus both these forms of energy can be utilised to generate electrical power.

hHVMrnK3aa	You take the sentences and translate them into symbols.  At least with school problems, you usually take  each sentence which has some information and  make it into one equation.    It might help to rewrite everything with one sentence per line,   instead of as a paragraph.  This is even more helpful when  the story is longer than just two sentences.    For example:  David has 83 coins in nickels and dimes. He has a total of $6.95.    Just by making it:  David has 83 coins in nickels and dimes.     He has a total of $6.95.      It's a lot easier to see what's going on.  You can put the equations underneath, or off to the right.      1) your guess is correct.    David has 83 coins in nickels and dimes.   N nickels, D dimes, 83 coins  N + D = 83    He has a total of $6.95.  Each nickel 5 cents, each dime 10 cents   --- This is an example of extra knowledge you bring to the problem.   --- It's not given.  Often it's something you learned earlier in class,   --- or something not quite so obvious as the values of coins.    Here's a tip: it's easier to do these in terms of cents  rather than dollars - you don't have to mess with fractions  and decimals:    5 * N + 10 * D = 695  (converting dollars to cents)  or just take your equation  0.05 N + 0.10 D = 6.95  and multiply everything by 100, but why not just do it up front ?    2.  Two people: T (Tonia) , F (father)  25 years difference in age: T + 25 = F (or F - T = 25)  Sum of ages: F + T = 75    3.

FUVakx3yaa	If you have 1000 babies and 4% are expected to have sickle-cell anemia, then the frequency of sickle-cell anemia is 4% or 0.04.  If we let p be the frequency of the normal allele and q be the frequency of the sickle-cell allele, then the frequency of babies with sickle-cell anemia is the probability that the babies would be homozygous (have two sickle-cell alleles), which would be q x q = q^2.  So, if q^2 is the frequency of babies with sickle-cell in the population and the frequency of babies with sickle-cell anemia is 0.04, then:    q^2 = 0.04, so q = 0.2    Since there are only two alleles, then the sum of the frequencies of the alleles must equal one, so:    p + q = 1  p = 1 - q  p = 1 - 0.2  p = 0.8    Since the frequency of homozygous normal individuals is given by the probability that the babies have two normal alleles, which is the product of the probability for each allele, so that p x p = p^2 and the frequency of heterozygotes is given by the probability that the babies will have one allele of each type which is p x q + q x p = 2pq, then:    p^2 = 0.8 x 0.8 = 0.64 (frequency of homozygous normal)  2pq = 2 x 0.8 x 0.2 = 0.32 (frequency of heterozygotes)    So, you would expect to have this many babies of the three genotypes:    0.64 x 1000 = 640 homozygous normal  0.32 x 1000 = 320 heterozygotes  0.04 x 1000 = 40 homozygous sickle-cell

X0e6p9Ilaa	The salt is used for TWO reasons.  The first is that the dissolving of NaCl or preferably CaCl2 in the thin film of water on snow or ice is exothermic. The dissolving process gives off some heat that causes more of the ice to melt and dissolve more of the CaCl2 which gives off more heat, and you get the idea.     The second reason comes from the freezing point depression of the resulting calcium chloride solution.  Freezing point depression is a colligative property which depends on the number of particles (Ca2+ and Cl-) ions in solution.  Therefore the resulting solution will freeze at a lower temperature and help to melt ice in which comes in contact.    ========= Follow up=========    Kate isn't quite right about the freezing of ocean of water.

Well basically the hydrogen in water bonds with the sodium and the oxygen with the chlorine, and this chemical reaction creates energy causing the ice to melt... but when this happens it doesn't actually sperate the water molecules up, the sodium and chlorine are attracted to the water.    because the water is in solution, the freezing point is lowered (depresses) so the snow/ice melts.|`|q5DTcOuaaa	It dissolves water of course.|`|ad6YgqZlaa	It melts the snow and prevents it from refreezing by lowering the melting or boiling point. The effect is called "Freezing point depression"|`|Pfc3aXBsaa	freezing point depression.  when salt is added, the freezing point of water is lowered.  therefore, if salt is placed on ice, the ice will melt if it is not cold enough outside to freeze the salt water.  the same principle can explain why oceans don't freeze.    ==========    Response to: "Kate isn't quite right about the freezing of ocean of water. Of course ocean water will freeze. Sea ice is common in polar regions. The north pole region should be covered with sea ice. (Provided global warming doesn't cause all of it to melt.) It simply freezes at a temperature below zero C."    I do realize that oceans will freeze at the poles, thanks.  Perhaps I should have worded it differently, but if you look at my answer, I do note that freezing will not occur unless it is cold enough outside to freeze the salt water.  The flipside to that is, of course, that if it is cold enough outside, salt water will freeze.  And, yes, freezing point depression does contribute to the fact that oceans are unable to freeze in areas where fresh water bodies are completely frozen.

70cf63c745874c449067b760725961e9aa	Solar radiation that is absorbed by the earth's surface is transformed into heat.Part of this heat energy is given out as long-wave radiation.Carbon dioxide is a powerful absorber of this terrestial(long-wave)radiation.Hence the air near the surface becomes warmer.Thus carbon dioxide is  responsible(along with other greenhouse gases) for the greenhouse effect and hence is considered as a greenhouse gas.So,carbon dioxide increases the average air temperature near the surface as it traps the heat thereby not allowing it to escape into space.
UAYzLyN4aa	I really doubt that you are "wondering" anything. I think you are trolling. Eventually someone will show up with an answer supporting creationism and you will give it "best answer."    later: My apologies then - there is so much of that in Y!A.     Ok then,... Science really has no view on the biblical story of creation, because it is not a scientific theory and cannot be tested by scientific methods.     Science has also not proven that evolution is correct. (Surprise!)     Science is, in fact, not in the business of proving things correct. (other than mathematical theories, for which we have absolute certainty.)     Proving a theory such as evolution - or any other scientific theory - to be universally correct is mathematically impossible, because you can't ever prove that nothing else ever happened or will ever happen. All science can do is test theories, say "hm, this one looks increasingly good," and throw away those that have been demonstrated to NOT work. Scientific theory is constantly subject to question, experiment, test, and change.     There is so much evidence that confirms the theory of evolution that pretty much all scientists have agreed that that's the way it is. They did so, in fact, over a hundred years ago, and the theory of evolution is now accepted as one of THE cornerstones of biology.     But that could change, given sufficient countering evidence.    The way science works is to test the consequences of a theory, and in particular of the negated version of a theory. For example, if natural selection did not occur, then we would expect a species of moths to *not* gradually change from light colored to dark colored as the trunks of the trees they inhabit darken over the decades due to soot from nearby coal-burning plants.     However the moths did change their spots, as it were. (I'm not making this up; this was an actual occurrence in recent times.) The falsified version of the theory is thereby disproven.     Notice! This does not absolutely prove the original theory (the moths could have changed color for some other reason than natural selection). But it does give support for it.     The fun thing about falsification is that If you find just one case where the falsified theory turns out to be true, then the original theory (in this case, the theory of evolution) would be disproven in the general case. (It might happen in specific cases, but it could no longer be used to explain the origin of all species.)     Unfortunately for the creationists, evolution has passed EVERY test so far.     Again I stress: this doesn't prove evolution is true! (Nor has science absolutely proven that ANY scientific theory is true. Other, again, than purely mathematical theories.) But it does mean that it is VERY well supported by experimental and analytical evidence.     Creationism on the other hand has passed NO tests, for the simple reason that it is not possible to test it. At all.     Here's why: The statement that "God did it" cannot be tested by experiment, only believed in; and any evidence you find that seems to support another theory can always be handwaved away with "well, God created things that way."     For example, many Creationists insist that the Earth was created with the fossil record intact, and with light waves from distant galaxies already "on their way." Well, isn't that convenient. But you can't disprove it. Of course you can't prove it either.     You can't falsify "God did it" either because God, as postulated in the Christian Bible, is omnipotent - if you accept that description of God, God most certainly *could* have done it. And if you don't accept that description of God, then you aren't talking about or testing the biblical story of creation. And this is what makes creationism NOT a scientific theory.     (Note that the belief that God had the ability doesn't prove that that's how it happened, either.)     Creationism could still be true, of course. Just as it can't be tested, it can't be disproven either.     And that's the difference. Evolution, because it is a proper scientific theory, could be disproven... if evidence were found that disproved it.     It just hasn't been disproven, because no such evidence has been found; what has been found is a HUGE amount of evidence in support of evolution.     Claims to the contrary come from people who either don't understand the evidence or simply close their eyes to it.     If you still want to believe in creationism, fine, go ahead - but you're kidding yourself if you think it is on the same footing, in terms of experimental tests and observation, with evolution.    Oh, and by the way: Creationists often point to things like  "gaps in the fossil record." But such gaps in no way disprove evolution. They just mean we haven't found those fossils yet. If you think about it, it's really remarkable that so many fossils are still there for us to find. The fact is that the fossil record is absolutely rife with connections from A to B to ... Z, all consistent with evolutionary theory, and the "objection" that we don't have an example of every last one-gene variation in every development line is simply a red herring thrown up by the creationists. Same goes for most of the rest of their objections. Every example of "irreducible complexity" that they've raised, for example, has been countered by solid examples.|`|ZKikquiOaa	The bible is not about logic, there is very little logic in it actually.  It's meant to be read and understood for its moral teachings.  Not to be taken literally.  This is why theologists at the Vatican spend hours upon hours reading and researching it.  If everything in the bible is taken at face value, everytime your girlfriend has a period she'll have to be quarantined for 7 days. or some such insane thing, as she's unclean.  Another one that has to do with the creation story is of course, Adam and Eve being the first people, created in the garden of Eden, and they eventually have two boys after getting kicked out.  Yet their boys were able to find wives?  There was no mention of god making more humans.    The creation story is just that, a story.  Much like the creation story of the norse, or the aborigins in Australia.      Most creationists will start with the story, knowing where they must be, they will pick and choose the evidence that best fits the story line to back up the argument.    Scientists on the other hand look at the evidence, and with an open mind, not knowing what the end result is, he'll follow all the evidence and draw a conclusion.  Then others will test his conclusion and if it stands, it becomes a theory.  There are many questions still open unanswered by science, and there will always be questions.  But if you really want to learn, open your mind and start reading science books.|`|oA1V1ljraa	Science completely denies creationism. It's nonsense.

The activity series is used to predict whether or not single replacement reactions (or redox reactions) will occur.    Double replacement reactions do not involve oxidation and reduction, so the activity series is not applicable. Some factors that determine whether or not a double replacement reaction occurs are:  1) formation of a precipitate (one or more products is insoluble)  2) formation of a gas  3) neutralization involving formation of water from an acid and base.

First you apply Newton's 2nd law with F=qE.    -Again I will assume the electric field E is pointing vertically upward and imparts a uniform vertical acceleration to the particle of a = F/m = qE/m.    -Then the particles vertical position is given by y=-[.5(qE)/m]x^2    -Since the motion is at constant acceleration the horizontal position is given by x=v(initial)t    -Combining the two equations yields y=-[(qE)/(2mv^2)]x^2    This is the equation for the particles motion in the uniform electric field.     -Next it enters (what I will assume to be) a uniform magnetic field B normal to the particle's motion.  Using F=ma, F=qvB, and a=v^2/r we obtain    r=(mv)/(qB)    Since F is normal to v the magnitude of v doesn't change.  From here we set B=constant and r=constant then this describes the motion of the particle in the uniform magnetic field---> a circle.     -You initially stated that the particle enters the magnetic field at an angle of 40 degrees but it is unclear with which plane it makes a 40 degree angle with.  You need to provide more information or perhaps a simple drawing and I could be of more assistance.    Hope this hepls|`|Gmvldblraa	I think you need to know the size of the charge on the mass.
kTaX5eh7aa	PI is always equal to 3.14, it will never be changed.    Constants are evaluated at the time the app is compiled. Where a static member is evaluated at run time and is not bound to an object. Therefore it can be accessed without creating an instance of the object.|`|A5oe6ZcSaa	I don't know VB, but in C/C++ a static variable has two characteristics that make it different from automatic or global variables.    First, it doesn't go away when the function returns.  So you can have a declaration of static long UseCount=0 and increment it later in the function: UseCount++    When you print UseCount, it will have the number of calls to the function.  This might be nice for keeping track of errors or not reinitializing something which is already initialized, etc.    The second characteristic is that a static variable declared outside of a function is not in scope (not visible) to other files.  This makes it "quasi-global" since it can be accessed from all functions in the one file.  This was great for Object Oriented techniques in C before C++ was created.

SvmZlLdaaa	No, mating dogs do not have to have the coital tie in order for pregnancy to result - an ex of mine had a Border Collie who became pregnant after a single mating, during which the two did not become tied. The tie simply means that the dog mating with the female has more chance of fathering her young - while the two are locked together, no other male can mate with the female, giving his sperm more time to reach her eggs. The tie usually lasts about half an hour, but it can be more or less depending on the individuals involved. If your dogs have mated, regardless of whether they have tied, there is a good chance of the female becoming pregnant.|`|AA10703176	If I understood your question, the gestation period for a gog is about 9 to 10 weeks.

AA10306863	Ants belong to a group of insects known as hymenoptera, or stinging insects, that includes ants, bees, and wasps. Wasps were first, and ants and bees are more specialized. Most of the workers are sterile females. The stinger is an ovipositor, which was an egg-laying device transformed into a weapon to inject small amounts of venom. The drones are the ones that have claspers. That would be homologous to what adult men have that you mentioned. The queen is the only female that can reproduce. They generally sting to death any eggs that will become queens unless she is ready to swarm and break off into two separate colonies.

IUmAflSqaa	How can we represent three consecutive even integers?  The first one must look like 2n for some integer n, simply because it's even.  Then the next one must be 2n+2, and the next must be 2n+4.  So their sum is:    2n+(2n+2)+(2n+4) = 6n+6 = 6(n+1)    Looks like it must be a multiple of 6.  So maybe that's a good guess as to what the set is.    Can any multiple of 6 be written as the sum of 3 consecutive evens?  Well, that means, given a multiple of 6, say 6k, k an integer, can I find an n so that the following is true?    2n+(2n+2)+(2n+4) = 6k

If you construct Pascal's triangle, you will see that row 3 has the numbers 1, 3, 3, 1.  These are the coefficients you will use.    To expand the binomial, first start with the first variable to the highest power, 3.    __x^3    For the second term, decrease the power on the variable by 1 and raise the second part of the binomial to the power 1.    __x^3 + __x^2(4^1) = __x^3 + __4x^2    For the third term, decrease the power on the variable by 1 and increase the power on the number by 1.    __x^3 + __4x^2 + __x(4^2) = __x^3 + __4x^2 + __16x    For the last term, decrease the power on the variable by 1 and increase the power on the number by 1.    __x^3 + __4x^2 + __16x + __4^3 = __x^3 + __4x^2 + __16x + __64    Now, put in the coefficients according to Pascal's triangle and multiply it all out.

It will be 20/100 x 22, which will be 4.40 (you get a discount of $4.40) so 22 - 4.40 = 17.60. you will pay $17.60 for new DVD  step 2:  work out the discount received on previously viewded DVD. 40/100 x 12 = 4.80 (discount of $4.80).  12 - 4.80 = 7.20. You will pay $7.20 for previously used DVD.  step 3: To get the total price you simply add $17.60 and $7.20, which would give you $28.80  step 4: Without a discount you would have paid $34. By paying $28.80 you would have saved $5.20    I hope that made sense, I wasnt really elaborate.

239bf03f74eeaad4c18a8972abf502cdaa	Osmotic pressure of a solution is given by:   = i?c?R?T    where  i  van't Hoff factor  (because proteins do not dissociate in water it is i=1)  c Molarity of solution (= moles solute per volume solution)  R universal gas constant  (use 62.363?67mmHg L /mol K because we have the pressure in mmHg)  T absolute temperature in K    From this formula you can get the molarity of the solution from the given osmotic pressure and temperature:  c =  / (i?R?T)  = 9.8mmHg / ( 1 ? 62.363?67mmHg L /mol K ? 298.15K)  = 5.2710??mol/L    Multiply by the volume and you get the protein number of moles:  n = V ? c = 0.1L ? 5.2710??mol/L = 5.2710??mol/L     So the molar mass of the protein is:  M = m/n = 0.2g / 5.2710??mol/L = 3794.6g/mol

So I promise you, I will put all my efforts in doing better in school.  I PROMISE I won't make you unhappy again.  I promise."  and then give her a big hug and a kiss.  Be sincere when you tell her the above (or make a version of it yourself.)    Your mom really cares about you and your future, which depends highly on how well you do in school.  She does it because she loves you, and wants the best life for you.  She has no other agenda in wanting you to do well in school; she just loves you a lot, and cares about your future.

4A6kUcB3aa	Ground level is different depending on where you live.  At least sea level is pretty standard around the world.  Since atmospheric pressure decreases the higher up you are (eg the farther you are from the center of the earth, since it is essentially the weight of an air column) it makes a difference as to what spot of ground you are standing on.  For instance, air pressure is lower in Denver that in New York, in general, due to altitude, although weather affects air pressure substantially which may hide the altitude effect

SLVocCNVaa	I'm not going to go through and calculate all of these out for you, but I will explain how they're done. For the first four, divide each number by Avogadro's number, which is  6.0221415  1023. That gives you the number of moles of the substance. Multiply that number by the element's molar mass, and you'll have your answer in grams.     The second set of problems is in reverse order. First divide the number of grams by the element's molar mass, then multiply it by Avogadro's number, which gives you your answer in atoms.

SLVocCNVaa	3AgNO3 +FeCl3 -> 3AgCL +Fe(NO3)3  That's your balanced equation.    First, you need to find the limiting reactant. Do this by taking the molar mass of both AgNO3 and FeCl3 then dividing them by the number of grams given. Whichever number is less is the limiting reactant.    Next, start with the limiting reactant's grams. Divide by that by the molar mass of the element you found to be the limiting reactant.     Here's where things get tricky.    If you found the LR to be AgNO3 then divide by 3. If it was FeCl3, then leave the number as is for right now.     After that, multiply by 3, then multiply that number by AgCl's molar mass.

YyXtxeNGaa	The key term is sampling.    A sample should reflect the characteristics of the entire population being studied.  In this case the population is the entire amount of river water.    The water at the river bottom will differ from the top as will as the middle and along the shoreline.  Faster moving water will hold solids in suspension easier than slower moving water.  Depending on the temperature and the time of year there may be more or less dissolved minerals.  Has it just rained or has there been an excessive amount of time from the last rainfall.    All of the above are sources of sampling error.  Choosing any particular sample will induce bias.  Therefore many different random samples should be taken.  Random is the key word here.    When and only when you have determined that you have a large enough sample to minimize or at least quantify the sampling error, you can start to analyze the result.    There is an old adage for computer analysis:  Garbage In = Garbage Out  The same holds true for statistical analysis.  Error is accumulative.  It only gets worse.
3bPRIkbUaa	If a disease hits the population, there will be little chance for the cheetahs to have means of adaptation to the disease. Since the cheetahs will more than likely have a similar genotype to their partner, the offspring have a great probability of also being prone to the disease, instead of evolving a type of adaptation or resistance to it, as would be per norm with a genetically varied population.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	This is called a bottleneck population;  there is little or no variation, so, if there is a change in the environment, there are no cheetahs with variations able to cope with the change.  The entire population will die.|`|8ssiOsDzaa	because if there isn't any variety, it means that all the cheetahs are alike, and so because there are always changes in the environment, the slightest change that would have a negative effect on the population could make it disappear, which is dangerous!  but if you had a variety in the population, in case of a sudden change or catastrophe, a part of the population would be able to survive it!|`|0cAuOUmoaa	If everyone has the same genes, natural selection can essentially wipe out the entire species.  In other words, the way a species survives natural selection is through mutations that make them more adaptive to their environment.  If all members of the environment share the same genes (and don't have any mutations) then no one will be able to survive a selection process.

t0FVaBqIaa	I will not dismiss the possibility of something paranormal going on, but most pictures that produce orbs are nothing more than dust particles.  Digital cameras are infamous for producing orbs in pictures.  The chills could be symptomatic to the fact you believe you are seeing ghosts in your pictures. The mind can have a profound effect on the body.  Orbs are nothing more than energy balls.  Sighting of orbs only means that you have some sort of excess energy that is visible.  Sighting of orbs can be a rare, but natural occurrence. Spirits must have an energy source to manifest, so it is sometimes misconstrued that spirits are orbs.  I hope that helps somewhat.|`|p0dxIZeSaa	most likely your lens or lighting, it happens a lot in facebook pictures. try another camera and you should be satisfied. you get chills because you are creeped out by the possibility of a ghost    GHOSTS ARENT REAL|`|iUE6K5HQaa	it is cold and you have a dusty room.

Now the second part of the question says using some info from what I just typed):      of Brushes = Twice (as many tubes of paint)  y = 2(x)    So now we can plug in    3x + (0.50)(2x) = 16  3x + x = 16  4x = 16  x = 4 or 4 tubes of paint    So now we know Kara purchased 4 tubes of paint.

At its maximum height, the final velocity of the ball is zero; hence,  Vf = 0.  The initial velocity is given to be Vi = 96 ft/sec.  We use the kinematics equation  2gd = Vf^2 - Vi^2 to solve for d, which is the vertical height reached by the ball.  d = (Vf^2 - Vi^2)/(2g)  d = [0^2 - (96 ft/sec)^2]/[(2)(-32 ft/sec^2)]  d = 144 ft.    Then we can use d = Vi(t) + (1/2)(g)(t^2) to solve for time, t.  144 ft = (96 ft/sec)(t) + (1/2)(-32 ft/sec^2)(t^2)  144 ft = (96 ft/sec)t - (16 ft/sec^2)(t^2)  (16 ft/sec)(t^2) - (96 ft/sec)(t) + 144 ft    Using the Quadratic Formula to solve for t:    t = {- (-96) +/- sqrt[(-96)^2 - 4(16)(144)]}/[2(16)]  t = 3 sec, answer    Hope this helps.    teddy boy|`|Lyfg59ETaa	it depends on the amount of force applied to the ball.|`|M9JcanLKaa	Using the standard equation:  s = ut +0.5*g*t^2 where s = distance; u the initial velocity; g acceleration due to gravity, -32 (opposite direction to u); t the time.

Therefore it takes 3 seconds to reaches its maximum height (and 3 seconds to return to the ground).    Using the equation again for t = 3:  s = 96*3 - 0.5*32*3^2  or s = 288 - 16*9      s = 288 - 144 = 144 feet|`|c3988adee76bb2df1e09bf7fdb3893bbaa	s = -16t^2 + 96t  So max occurs when t = 3 seconds|`|eWfBYZA8aa	about 96 seconds

s8KonZc5aa	Lets say you have a function of x :  f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 7    you will have 3 roots, because the highest power of x is 3.    if the function was  f(x) = x^7 + x^4 + 3    you would have 7 roots.      This is because there is a root for every x. So if there is an x^7, it is the same as writing x*x*x*x*x*x*x    That is in the simplest case.  There can be constants that modify x, but that doesnt change anything too much    For example, if you have  x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0    x is to the power of 2. So you know you have 2 roots.  You then try to factor out x's until the highest x is to power 1.  (x+3)(x+2) = 0    Then, either x+3=0, or x+2=0.  If you solve both of those, x can either be -3, or -2.    Therefore, the roots to that equation are x=-3, x=-2.

mL3WTsXfaa	Plugging infinity into the expression gives an indeterminate quantity, so    Let y = (1 + 5/n)^n    ln y = n ln(1 + 5/n) = [ln(1 + 5/n)]/(1/n)    Now if we plug infinity into the expression, we get 0/0 and we can apply L'Hopital's rule.    The derivative of the numerator is    [1/(1 + 5/n)](-5/n2)    The derivative of the denominator is    -1/n2    The ratio of numerator to denominator is    [(-5/n2)/(1 + 5/n)]/(-1/n2) = 5/(1 + 5/n)    Now lim n -->   5/(1 + 5/n) = 5    But 5 is the limit of ln y, so the limit of y is e^5, which is about 148.413.

fmr98EBtaa	Your answer is found in the equation for density. Density = mass divided by volume. In order to increase the density of something you need to either increase the mass while maintaining or increasing the volume, or you need to lower the volume while maintaining or increasing the mass. So, if you want to increase density while at the same time decreasing mass, you would have to decrease volume by a greater proportion than you decreased the mass.

Ice is just more organized and rigid water. Water is looser and doesnt have a perfect shape.|`|AA10348639	Ice and water are basically the same in the fact that they are just different physical changes of the substance water. As you know obviously, water is made up of H2O, both Hydrogen and Oxygen are of course gases at room temperature, only when in the molecule for water are they actually liquid unless adversely frozen individually.  Oxygen's boiling point is -183 oC, Hydrogens boiling point is -252.87 oC. The boiling point refers to when the gas in a liquid form turns to the gas form we all know of. Water's boiling point is 100 oC.   I mention these as an inquisitive mind might ask why water is a liquid at the temperature it's at normally, when the atoms that make it up would normally be a gas. Simply the density and entanglement of the molecules generate water's apparent look and feel, where the gases frozen individually to liquid form is using the inert nature of freezing to increase the atomic density and appear as a liquid.  The above is just how liquid is, however when these forms (either elements or molecular substance) are frozen down further, their density increases further, generating the solid state.  Again due to water being molecular it takes less freezing to produce a solid state (0 oC), where as Oxygen (-218.4 o C) and Hydrogen (-259.14 o C ) take yet further freezing on their own.   Water has three states. Below freezing water is a solid (ice or snowflakes), between freezing and boiling water is a liquid, and above its boiling point water is a gas. There are words scientists use to describe water changing from one state to another. Water changing from solid to liquid is said to be melting. When it changes from liquid to gas it is evaporating. Water changing from gas to liquid is called condensation (An example is the 'dew' that forms on the outside of a glass of cold soda). Frost formation is when water changes from gas directly to solid form. When water changes directly from solid to gas the process is called sublimation.   Most liquids contract (get smaller) when they get colder. Water is different. Water contracts until it reaches 4 C then it expands until it is solid. Solid water is less dense that liquid water because of this. If water worked like other liquids, then there would be no such thing as an ice berg, the ice in your soft drink would sink to the bottom of the glass, and ponds would freeze from the bottom up!  Water is found on Earth in all three forms. This is because Earth is a very special planet with just the right range of temperatures and air pressures. Earth is said to be at the triple point for water.

0cAuOUmoaa	Since polygenic traits are controlled by many different genes, the variation in a population should resemble a normal curve.  In statistics, the occurence of a normal distribution is most commonly do to a population controlled by a large number of small effects.  In this case, the small effects are the different genes (and different alleles for each gene) that control the height phenotype.  When you graph the average heights of your class, you should end up with a graph that looks like a bell curve (or a "big hump").  With such as small sample size, however, it may be hard to distinguish the actual nature of the distribution.

Therefore    (1)   a+b+c+d=360    Let a be the non-convex angle, and let g be the angle whose interior does not intersect the interior of the quadrilateral. Therefore a and g are explementary angles, that is,     (2)   a+g=360.    By comparing (1) and (2) we obtain g=b+c+d, which completes the proof.

R1NHUuyzaa	the "known imaginary numbers" are technically infinite.    any number that can be divided by the square root of negative one to get a real number is an imaginary number. The opposite is also true: any real number times the square root of negative one is an imaginary number. Generally, because imaginary numbers cannot be expressed in writing, we express them as a real number times i, or the square root of negative one.    It is used in the field of electronics.

Let X be the angle between ~a and ~b so that ~a.~b =|~a||~b|cosX    Let  ~u = |~a|~b + |~b|~a and Z be the angle between ~a and ~u    ~a.~u = |~a||~u|cosZ where the magnitude of ~u is found to be                 ~a.~u = 2.|~a|^2.|~b|[(1 + cosX)]cosZ    Also  ~a.~u + ~a.[|~a|~b + |~b|~a] = |~a|^2.|~b|(1 + cosX)    This gives                 2.|~a|^2.|~b|[(1 + cosX)]cosZ = |~a|^2.|~b|(1 + cosX)            or  2.cosZ =(1 + cosX)    Squaring    2cos^2(Z) = 1 + cosX    and from the double angle formula                    2cos^2(X) = 1 + cos2X  we conclude Z = X/2.    You can then perform a similar argument by considering  the inner product of ~b and ~u and showing the angle is again X/2.

The phenotypic ratio for the F1 generation will be 1 (they will all show the "aa" phenotype).      If you are looking for a dominant : recessive ratio, then you are right, it would techinally be 0:4 recessive because there aren't any dominant alleles in the parent generation.

u9LweEI2aa	When adding or subtracting fractions, the first thing you must do is find a common denominator and transform each term of the problem into a fraction that has the same denominator as every other term in the problem.    1. 5/8 - 1/4    The common denominator between 8 and 4 is 8.  This means that the first term, 5/8, will not need to be changed. The second term, 1/4 will need to be changed to a fraction with an 8 on bottom.  Ask yourself, "What must I multiply 4 by to get 8?" The answer is 2 since 2x4=8.  As you know, any number multiplied by one returns a result equal to the same number.  This means that we can multiply to fraction 1/4 by one, in the form of 2/2, and thus arrive at the desired denominator of 8. (1/4 x 2/2 = 2/8)    5/8 - 1/4  5/8 - (1/4 X 2/2)  5/8 - 2/8  (5-2)/8  3/8      2. 5/6 + 1/3    The common denomonator between 6 and 3 is 6.  5/6 can be left alone.  1/3 must be changed into an equivalent fraction with a 6 on the bottom.  "What would you multiply 3 by to get 6?"  The answer is 2.  This means that multiplying 1/3 by 2/2 will produce the fraction 2/6 which can be added to 5/6 by simply adding the numerators and placing the aanswer over the common denominator 6    5/6 + 1/3  5/6 + (1/3 X 2/2)  5/6 + 2/6  (5+2)/6  7/6 or 1 1/6      3. 3/4 - 1/3    Common denominator between 3 and 4 is 12    3/4 x 3/3 = 9/12    1/3 x 4/4 = 4/12    3/4 - 1/3  9/12 - 4/12  (9-4)/12  5/12      4. 5/12 - 1/6    Common denominator between 6 and 12 is 12.    5/12 is fine as it is    1/6 x 2/2 = 2/12    5/12 - 2/12  (5-2)/12  3/12 = 1/4       5. 7/10 - 1/15    The common denominator between 10 and 15 is 30.    7/10 x 3/3 = 21/30    1/15 x 2/2 = 2/30    21/30 - 2/30  (21-2)/30  19/30

Lt1u4hRIaa	Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other, such as 6 and -1/6, or 2/3 and -3/2. The slope of a line perpendicular to a given line is the reciprocal and of the opposite sign (positive or negative) of the slope of the given line.    For this problem:    Rewrite in "y=mx+b" form.  x-6y=2 ---> -6y= -x+2 ---> y = (1/6)x - 1/3  The slope is 1/6, so the slope of the perpendicular line is -6.

D0znfBeXaa	According to fundamental theorem of calculus,  if F(x) = [a, x]  f(t) dt then F (x) = f(x).    So,  F (x) = sin(x2)    Now we can find critical points where F(x) = 0:    sin(x2) = 0  x2 = n*pi, n = 0, 1, 2,   x = n*pi,  x = 0,  pi, 2pi, 3pi, ...  which is equal approximately to  x = 0, 1.8, 2.5, ...    Just x=0 and x= pi  1.8 are within the given interval [-1; 2].  Now lets apply the first derivative test.  You can use graphic calculator to determine a sign   of the first derivative.  Interval_______F (x)________F(x)  (-1; 0)________ + __________increases  (0;  pi) ______ + __________increases  ( pi; 2) ______ - __________decreases    And as we see from the table the function F(x) doesnt have   a local minimum in the interval [-1; 2], just local maximum  at the point x =  pi.|`|BhumxInEaa	The fundamental theorem of calculus says that if  F(x) integral of f(x)  then F'(x) = f(x)    A maximum or minimum of a differentiable function can only occur either at the end points or at points where the derivative is 0.    So to find a local minimum of the integral, first find the zeros of sin(x^2). Some of these will be minima and some will be maxima. You can tell which by looking at how sin(x^2) is behaving. At a minimum, sin(x^2) will be increasing (going from negative to positive).    It is not at all clear why you need a graphing calculator, but feel free to use one if it will help you.

Just plug in -1/2 for each x in the function h(x)    h(-1/2)= (-1/2)^2+1            = 1/4+1            = 5/4  This is the solution for h(-1/2)    You then want to place this number into the function g(x) therefore you want to find    g(5/4)=2(5/4)-1           =10/4 -1           = 3/2    There you go....that is your answer

The sides of a right triangle follow the Pythagorean Theorem.    a2 + b2 = c2    Where:  a = leg (length)  b = leg (width)  c = hypotenuse (diagonal)    Plug in your values for the two legs:  1202 + 1602 = c2  14400 + 25600 = c2  c2 = 40000    Take the square root of both sides:  c = 40000  c = 4 * 100 * 100  c = 2 * 10 * 10  c = 200    Answer:  The diagonal distance is 200 feet    P.S.

A^2 + B^2 = C^2 where A and B are the sides, and C is the hypotenuse.    Find 120^2 and 160^2, add them together, and then take the square root of that number.    Then you will get your answer...|`|WTf0caplaa	Pythagorean theorem    A^2 + B^2 = C^2    Where,   A = 120  B = 160  C = Length of hypotenuse      |\  A| \ C    |  \     B    so C = sqrt(120^2+160^2) = 200ft|`|oRVrmt3xaa	The playground is a rectangle which means it has four right angles.  The diagonal forms two right triangles.  One right triangle has legs of 120 and 160.    You use the pythagorean theorem .   A squared plus B squared = C squared.     120 Squared + 160 Squared = C squared.  14400 + 25600 = C Squared.    Add and you get.  40000 = C squared.  Square root both sides and you get C = 200    So the diagnal is 200 feet

AA10927246	Remember that a fraction is simply a division:  1 divided by -4 is the same as -1 divided by 4.    In other words, just bring the negative sign to the numerator:    (-3/4) - (-1/4)    Change the sign and add:  (-3/4) + (1/4)    You have the same denominator:  (-3 + 1) / 4  -2/4    Reduce:  -1/2    P.S.  The other way to understand the sign switch is to multiply the numerator and denominator by -1.  That makes 1/-4 become -1/4.  That's another way to show they are the same thing:  1 .. -1 .. -1  -- x --- = ---   -4 . -1 ... 4    P.P.S.  You should never *add* something to a denominator like that.  That's an invalid operation.  You can only *multiply* the numerator and denominator by the same value.  If you could add, then you'd have some weird things happening:  1/2 = 2/3 = 3/4 = 4/5 = 5/6, etc.  I'm sure you can see that that isn't valid, is it?|`|BmB5UWUVaa	1/-4 = -(1/4)    +/+ = +  -/+ = -  +/- = -  -/- = +|`|VAsHqPNJaa	The negative shouldn't matter    In math, if you put the negative in either the top or bottom, it just means the entire fraction is negative    just think of it as  -3/4 -- -1/4  so  -3/4 +1/4=-2/4  or -1/2|`|6Fqr2K1xaa	I can see how you came up with your reasoning, but, you can't do that. All you need to do when you see that negative in the denominator is pull it out to the front and then your minus in the problem becomes a plus. So you have (-3/4) + (1/4) = -1/2|`|CFZvuB1Eaa	What is important is to know that  -(1/4) = (-1/4) = (1/-4)    So, (-3/4) - (1/-4) can be rewritten as -(3/4) - -(1/4)    Since subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive value we can once again rewrite it as -(3/4) + (1/4) which finally can be arranged to look like this.    (1/4) - (3/4)    Both of these fractions have the same denominator (called a "common denominator"), thus your answer will have the same denominator. In this case you only have to consider the numerator.  Here it is 1 - 3, which is -2.. So the final answer is..    -2/4  which can be reduced to -1/2

As the positive ion go down the axon, it changes the charge, and opens the gate..  thats what i know, hope that will help

The cell walls of the fungi are made of chitin rather than cellulose.  Plants have true tissues and organs where as fungi lack differentiated tissues.  Fungi can reproduce asexual by fragmentation and formation of spores by mitosis.  Plants reproduce asexually by vegetative means such as runners, rhizomes, or plantlets.  Plants have two distinct generations, sporophyte and gametophyte.  Fungi reproduce sexually by formation of sexual spores.

In prep for the transplant, the patients cells would be harvested first.  They can ONLY use their own cells if they are currently disease free, which is NOT the cause for a majority of patients.  The harvested cells are frozen, then the patient goes through high dose chemo and radiation to kill all of the existing marrow tissue.  Then the cells are infused via IV much the same as any other blood product.  However, because the entire marrow was killed, even being the patient's own cells, there is a chance the new cells will still fight the body because it doesnt recognize it, and then failure to engraft or gvhd.

HGtX5iQgaa	you use the equation y=a b^x where y is the total money, a is the starting value, b is the rate, and x is the time. keep in mind when using b as the rate, if you are increasing you need to add a 1 because it is 100 percent plus more. ex: 5.5% increase is really 1.055    another equation is     a=p(1+r)^n    where a is the amount of money you have, p is the principal, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of years.    these are both exponential functions     hope i helped :)

OWPkhnf5aa	The probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent yes/no experiments, each of which yields success with probability p is called a binomial distribution.    You have yes/no experiments: vehicle needs service, yes or no?  Each with a probability p (p=14%).  They are independent. That is a reasonable assumption. If vehicle 1 needs service, that does not mean anything about vehicle 2 (unless they are all coming from a lemon production line. Oh well).    Then the probability of having k vehicles out of n in need of service is:    P(k,n) = nCk*p^k*(1-p)^(n-k)  where nCk = n!/(k!(n-k)!)    Question 1:  exactly 3 vehicles require service:  P(3,9) = 9C3*0.14^3*0.86^6 = 0.0133 = 1.33%    exactly 3 vehicles don't require service:  P(3,9) = 9C3*0.86^3*0.14^6 = 0.000057 = 0.0057%    Question 2  The expected value of a binomial distribution is E(X)= np where n is the number of trials and p the probability of success in each trial.  E(X) = 9*0.14 = 1.26    An average of 14% of your 9 vehicles will require service.  That is 1.26 vehicles.

The proof will consist of a proof by induction:    Show that the statement is true for x  = 1. Very simple!  Then show it is true for x + 1. Here you'll need to do some algebra and think about what the floor function means. Not so difficult!    If it's true for these two cases then it's true for all x

It's when a spirit "teleports" an object from one place to another.  usually to get your attention or to communicate some how.    You might try asking them to do other things... try recording while you ask questions.  like "What's your name?  Where are you?  When did you die?  How did you die?  Why did you throw the nickle at me?"    It doesn't matter how old your house is.  If a spirit wants to  contact you it will...somehow.  Also, objects can be the connection, not just houses.  have you or your family recently brought in an object... something either old, handed down, bought at a thrift/secondhand store or estate sale?

Even though your house was built in 1997 and you have been the only one to live in it,  what was on that land before?

Chalk up the flying nickel as something strange and ignore it.  Most likely you fell victim to the ninja sister throwing coins and feigning ignorance when confronted.

Your sister could have sneaked in and placed it on your towel when you grabbed the towel or something it appeared to past you.Without being there that is what would speculate to have happened. there are some logical reasons.     I would suggest for you to act as if it did not happen even try to forget about it. However that being said if you notice other things write them down keep track of the things going on. Have you recently lost a loved one? maybe dug on the land (pool)... All these things could lead to the possibility of a haunting.         It is not uncommon for spirits to use coins to get your attention. There are many stories and instances that this happens.

The ghost would collect them off the bedside table one at a time and then give them back in a pile.    We used to experiment and ask it to do it and lock all the windows and shut the only door and wait outside for a few minutes and go back in to find them taken or returned.    I always thought that it was odd that it was only dimes, and once we caught on to them going missing for the first time - slowly - after several that were noticed disappeared, and started trying to interact - the activity only increased and practically happened on command.    It was in a pretty new house built in probably the late 70's maybe 80's.  Don't know if that story is useful or not but I thought I would share.

UhNdzd2oaa	930  is coterminal with 210 .    So we need to find the reference angle of 210 .    since 210 - 180 =  30    30  is the reference angle, but we still need to keep in mind that 210 is in quadrant 3, where x and y are both negative.    The 30-60-90 triangle is one that every one needs to remember. It's sides have lengths 3, 2, 1.    Looking at it from the angle of 30, 3 is adjacent, 2, is the hypotenuse, and 1 is opposite.    However, we are in quadrant 3, where  x and y , are negative, so the adjacent and opposite are negative. This means looking at it from the angle of 210, -3 is adjacent, 2, is the hypotenuse, and -1 is opposite.      Since:  sin x = opp/hyp, then sin 30 = -1/2  cos x = adj/hyp, then cos 30 = -3/2  tan x = sin x/cos x = -1/2/ -3/2 = 1/3    of course, the rest of the functions are just the inverse of these:  csc x = -2/1 = -2  sec x = -2/3  cot x = -3/ -1 = 3
6DiN02mJaa	This is very well-known old problem, the answers are:  (a) cube;  (b) half cube /lateral edge twice shorter than base edge/.    The shortest proof of (a) uses the inequality between arithmetic and geometric means. Let a, b, c are the dimensions of the box, A - its area, V - volume, then  A = 2(ab + bc + ca) = const; V = abc, apply the inequality for ab, bc, ca:  (ab + bc + ca)/3  3((ab)(bc)(ca)) or A/6  3(V2) or V  (A/6)3  The right hand side is a constant, so V will attain the largest possible value if   V = (A/6)3, but according the inequality this requires  ab = bc = ca, the latter quickly leads to  a = b = c /cube/.    Imagine an open box, cover it with another identical one, turned upside down /or, equivalently, consider the open box along with its symmetrical image with respect to the plane of the missing face/. The set union of  both boxes is a closed box and according (a) its volume will be maximal if it is a cube. Hence the required shape for (b) is half cube.
IUmAflSqaa	A^3 is upper-triangular, i.e. all entries below the main diagonal are 0, so it's not a bad idea to assume that A is upper-triangular, too.  If:    A =  [a, b;  0, c]    Then we know that:    A^3 =  [a^3, *;  0, c^3]    where * means I'm too lazy to figure out what goes in that spot.  So we're forced to use a = 2, c = 3.  So:    A =  [2, b;  0, 3]    Now raise this to the third power to get an equation for b, and then solve for b.

You could then multiply the total number of guests by that 8%, 5175 * 0.08 = 414 pop-corns bought.  or  Divide the total number of guests by 25 to get how many groups of 25. 5175 / 25 = 207 groups. Multiply that by how many buy popcorn per 25 guests, 207 * 2 = 414 pop-corns bought.    Both are the same calculation, 5175 * 2 / 25 but it depends on how you want to think about the problem.

ZySFr8btaa	Well I couldn't remember the formula to begin with then I had a look at the units and I realised it isn't all that hard.     You have two values, one with the unit C, and one with the unit N/C. You are trying to calculate N, so we can work out the equation. To work out the intensity, you need to divide a force (N) by a charge (C), which gives you the units N/C.    Therefore if intensity = force / charge  force = intensity x charge  force = 35.0 x 8.2*10^-5  force = 0.00287 Newtons  force = 2.87*10^-3 N    Hope that helps. The idea with the formula is one I picked up in a test sometime when I couldn't remember the formula. You should try and remember it - sometimes it's really handy.     If you want any more help or more explanation, get in touch.
tTg1XU8faa	The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis and y = 0. The point is always (x, 0). Slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. So:    1.) m =1, so the equation so far is y = x + b. The x-intercept is point (4, 0), so substitute the point into the equation for x and y to solve for b:  y = x + b  0 = 4 + b  -4 = b  ANSWER: y = x - 4    2.) The x-intercept is point (2, 0). You already know that the y-intercept is 4, so b = 4 and the equation so far is y = mx + 4. Substitute (2, 0) for x and y to solve for m:  y = mx + 4  0 = 2m + 4  -4 = 2m  -2 = m  ANSWER: y = -2x + 4    3.) There is no slope, so that means the equation is automatically x = ? with no y variable in the equation at all. The x-intercept is 2, so the equation is just:  ANSWER: x = 2|`|RlzoKSB7aa	When you are given an x intercept, that is telling you what x equals when y= 0.  It's the other way around with the y intercept.    1.  m=1 and point (4,0) so use point slope form    y-0 = 1(x-4)    so y= x-4    2. you are given two points (2,0) and (0,4) so you can solve for slope with the difference of y values over the difference in the x values.    m = 4/-2 or -2  Then use point slope form again    y-0 = -2(x-2)   so y = -2x + 4    3.  No slope means the equation is a vertical line, and the x intercept is 2.  That means you have a vertical line a x= 2.    So your answer is x=2, which is the only way you can write the equation.|`|8c1907dde46c7fbd753cec57b372af40aa	The x-intercept is the point where the graph cuts the x-axis, i.e. y=0.

So in this case, its 52+(-40) = 12. One more time and you should get another 60 under the given 60 and it will cancel out to give you 0.

Steel is iron which has a small amount of carbon included so that it has to be done in some manner which permits the iron to mix with the carbon.  Actually it is true for many metals which we commonly use that there are fairly complex manufacturing techniques which will produce specialty metals that have unique characteristics, and those have to be tailored carefully.  So brass and steel are general names for materials which are designed for special applications.
n5u3rkV4aa	well osmosis occurs when water diffuses from a low solute concentration to a high solute concentration. So basically the water goes from a dilute solution to a concentrate.

NFEKbYKjaa	Let's put this in a basic sense.  The Domain of a function is all the numbers that are able to satisfy x.  The Range of a function is all the numbers that are able to satisfy y because of any x.  *Tip* Look for anything that can prevent x from being a number.    So for f(x)=2x , nothing prevents x from being something so x can be any number, hence "all real numbers" and therefore all y's will be satisfied too.    For h(x)= -0.6x ...there is a square root which means the value inside that square root cannot be less than zero and since x is the only value within the square root, it cannot be   That is why the Domain is [0,)  The Range is [0,-)    I am unsure where you got"answer is domain:all real numbers range [0,)"|`|RtVxPF9faa	Well basically, when you get domain and range questions you need to visualize the actual graph if you can. Then ask yourself if it has any limits to the left? To the right? Up? Down? If it does, where does the graph discontinue?     Graphs will only have limits, generally, if there is a value that you can plug in that makes the answer undefined. For example, in your root function, you cannot plug in a negative number which is why there is a range restriction since "x" cannot be greater than 0 or a negative number.    And if you picture the graph, it is true since root functions without transformations don't go through the x-axis, they just increase to the right until positive infinity.|`|3uE9Zk3saa	A) Any real number you sub for x will still give a real number, because it is simply being doubled. Therefore the domain is all real numbers.    If you divide both sides of the equation y = 2x, you get x = y/2. If you plug in any real number for y, you will still get a real number. Therefore the range is all real numbers.  --------------------------------------...  B) You can't sub a negative number into x, but you can sub anything else. Therefore the domain is [0, ).    The square root function always returns a non-negative number. Therefore the range is also [0, ).

BhumxInEaa	The torques must balance.    torque = mass x radius    (a) If we assume the children are point masses (which they clearly aren't) and x is the distance from the pivot to the first child, you have:    M1 x = M2 (L - x)    where L is the total distance between the masses.    (b) For two point masses on each side we have:    M1 R1 + M2 R2 = M3 R3 + M4 R4    You have all four masses and R1, R2, and R4, so you can solve for R3.
BhumxInEaa	1. since ((x^2 - x)/2) must equal an integer, so must x    2. For large enough x, ((x^2 - x)/2) > 1 + ((x^2 + 3)/4) so x has to be fairly small.    3. That means you can just try the first few integers.  x = 0 clearly works, but it isn't the only solution.

9Xur3g9Paa	Caffeine is mildly addicting, although many specialists in addiction medicine would probably say it is habit forming.  There is mild withdrawal from chronic caffeine use including headache, irritability and sometimes gastrointestinal discomfort.  If you want to reduce your caffeine intake, and your primary source of caffeine is from coffee or tea, try drinking less or drinking half-decaf and half regular. There would be no real benefit to try to measure your actual caffeine intake if it is from beverages.  Just drink less.
AWPaPV4Eaa	Bromine is more reactive than iodine, and bromine will displace iodide ion from solution:    Br2 + 2I- ----> 2Br- + I2    The reddish-brown color of the bromine water will be replaced by the yellowish-brown color of iodine.  If enough bromine water is added, you might get dark iodine crystals precipitating out.    Hexane is nonpolar and immiscible with water - it will float on top.  I2 is nonpolar and thus much more soluble in a nonpolar solvent like hexane than it is in water (though I2 reacts with excess iodide to form the triiodide ion, I3-, which is soluble in water).  The iodine will be transferred to the hexane phase, which will turn purple from the iodine.  The water will become lighter in color.

Accordingly, *there is no correct answer to this problem - the definite integral, as opposed to the indefinite integral.    If I evaluate it at x = 6, then I get:    sqrt(6) * [2 * ln(36) - 4]    Since 2 * ln(36) = 2 *  ln(6^2) = 4*ln(6) the evaluation at x = 6 finally simplifies to:    4 * sqrt(6) * [ln(6) - 1]....This is really the best that I or any other professional mathematician can do since ln(0) **is undefined**.  ----------------------------

9vYaJkTuaa	The dots and crosses represent the electrons in the outer shell of the atoms in the compound. So lithium will have 1 cross and sulfur will have 6 dots. Sulfur needs 8 dots to have a full outer shell so two lithium atoms must give their outer electrons to the sulfur. This mean that the ionic compound is Li2S.    You draw this as [Li]+  [S]2-  [Li]+ with 6 dots and 2 crosses around the S to show what electrons it has. The crosses were given to it by the lithium atoms. This diagram shows you where the electrons in the compound have come from.

This makes it harder for the ice to form chrystals (freeze).

The simplest way to measure the efficiency is just to measure the voltage drop across the cell. All hydrogen generators give pretty much the same number of moles per coulomb, the trick is to keep the voltage low yet the currrent density high.    All professional type hydrogen generators use a proton exchange membrane.

oXPDFw4daa	The process of generation is fairly simple - the water wheel or wind turbine rotates a magnet inside a coil of wire, cause a voltage to be generated across that coil.      The thing that is different today is that we tend to have a 'grid' - that is, we have a network of generators and loads all connected in parallel.  In North America, we actually have only five grids - Eastern US, Eastern Canada, Texas, Western US, and Mexico.  The complexity of wind generators today is associated with the things that have to be done to make a bunch of them work together.
820e78fb52fa6459785b110a32d806b6aa	I'll do this 2 ways. The first method is to grind out out the answer.  The second will use more advanced ideas.  Method 1:  We want to show that A^2 + 2*A -11I = 0.  We get  A^2 =  1 2...... 1  2   4 -3  *  4  -3   =  9  -4  -8  17  2A =  2  4  8  -6  A^2 + 2*A =  11 0  0  11  Thus  A^2 + 2A -11*I = 0.  Method 2.  Compute the characteristic equation of A:  1 - x  2  4  -3 - x   = 0.  (This is a determinant. It's so hard to type the right  symbols here!)  Expanding this, we get  x^2 + 2x - 11 = 0.  But the Cayley, Hamilton theorem says that every  matrix is a zero of its characteristic equation, so we must have  A^2 + 2*A - 11*I = 0,  as required.

NAD and FAD are essentially energy carriers. they pick up electrons that are released when glucose is broken down in glycolysis, and they carry it to the ETC where the energy is used to pump H+ which creates a gradient allowing for production of ATP (i'm assuming you know how that works)    2. i'm not sure, but i think it's because fermentation requires the cell to go into aerobic respiration (no air, no oxygen). if there were air, krebs cycle and ETC would proceed... which doesnt help fermentation    3. electron transport chain (ETC). 32 are formed this way.    4. not sure    5. lactic acid. the pyruvic acid at the end of glycolysis gets reduced by NADH, which produces lactic acid and NAD+, the NAD+ goes back to pick up more electrons from glycolysis... pyruvic acid continues to be converted to lactic acid.. etc etc.      i hope this helped  : )|`|3YK2dJxLaa	4.

6uoseXfqaa	EDIT:  Added to answer asker's Additional Details 2/2    You just need to figure out how many half-lives have taken place, and multiply that number by the value you are given for the half-life of that isotope.    For example, if you have 25% parent material, then two half-lives have taken place. Remember that each half-life means that half of the remaining parent material has decayed into the daughter material. So one half-life would mean you have 50% parent, and a second half-life would mean 25% of the parent is left, and so on.    half-lives occurred  x  half-life of isotope  =  radiometric age in years      EDIT:    This is a gem of a question. The basics of radiometric dating I described above, while helpful to explain the concept of radiometric dating, are of little use in calculating an actual exponential decay problem. Without the extra details, I assumed a basic question, and gave a basic answer.    You may want to double-check my work on this, just a forewarning, but here goes:    We have to use two equations for this: the standard exponential decay equation, and the half-life equation. Since we know the half-life, we can plug that into the half-life equation and solve for the rate constant "k," which we can then plug into the exponential decay equation and solve for time elapsed (age of the zircon).      ********************************    1. Exponential Decay Equation:  N=Ni e^kt    ( N is the final amount, Ni is the initial amount, and t is the time)    2. Half-Life Equation:  half-life=-ln(2) / k    ********************************      First, using the half-life equation, we plug our given value in and solve for k.    4500my = -ln(2) / k    -ln(2) / 4500my = k    k = -0.000154    Note that k is a negative number. This is logical because it is a rate constant for something that gets smaller with time.    Second, we take our k value and plug it into the exponential decay equation. This is the point where, admittedly, my memory gets murky. From what I understand, half-life does not depend on the amount of material present, because the half-life stays constant at 4500 million years. So for N and Ni, we can assume a 100g sample, and do something like this:    86.3=100 e^kt    ...which becomes...    .863 = e^kt    So then plugging in our k value and using the property of natural logs (ln e^p = p)...    .863 = e^(-.000154 x t)    ln(.863) = ln (e^-.000154 x t)    ln(.863) = -.000154 x t    **Divide both sides by -.000154**    ln(.863) / -.000154 = t    t = 956.76    Remember that this value for t is in millions of years, so if 86.3% of the parent isotope in the zircon is present, then the original zircon is 956.79 million years old.    This is where my memory begins to fail me. The multiplication factor, I believe, is some sort of locally-derived "fudge factor" to account for some process that has/had the potential to alter the results for your specific zircon. Modern U-Pb dating techniques for zircon minerals can have an accuracy of 2 to 4%, which in our sample would be a +/- of 1.9 to 3.8 million years.    Multiplying our calculated age by 0.125 gives a value of 119.60, which, if used as a +/- would be a significant uncertainty gap, reflecting an accuracy of +/- 12%. This doesn't seem correct to me, being so far off of the accuracy of modern techniques.    Perhaps your zircon sample is not pure, and encountered some partial melting of adjacent, pre-existing zircons during its crystallization. This would certainly add to its calculated age, giving us a value of 1076.36 million years.    But whatever, I guess that's for you to figure out with the information you have been given with the problem. The age of your sample is 956.76 million years, and I hope I explained how to reach that in a way that helps you make sense of it.    You can check it using this graph, and follow the links for a more detailed explanation for using exponential decay equations.    http://www.acad.carleton.edu/curricular/...    http://math.ucsd.edu/~wgarner/math4c/tex...    http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/lit...

(a)  lim [n  ] 1/(6n2 + 1) = 0    Proof:    For all  > 0 there exists a N > 0 such that, for all natural numbers n, if    n > N ? |(1/(6n2 + 1)) - 0|     Lets play around with the second inequality:    |(1/(6n2 + 1)) - 0|   ? |1/(6n2 + 1)|   ? 1/   ? 1/ - 1   ? n > [(1 - )/6]    This looks like the first inequality (i.e. n > N).  Therefore, set N = [(1 - )/6] and I'll leave it to you to verify that such a N does indeed work which is trivial, but logically required.  If you're wondering why I took the positive root then its because N > 0.    (b) and (c) are essentially the same.  They are probably more tedious, but the exact same process (i.e. you have to "solve" for N).    If you have troubles doing the others, email me and I'll help you out.    Hope this helps!

Notice that,    ||b_n| - |b||  |b_n - b|     Therefore, |b_n| certainly converge to |b|.    The converse is false.  Here's a counterexample:    Consider the sequence, {b_n} = {(-1)?}.     {|b_n|} converges, namely to 1.  However, {b_n} doesn't converge as it alternates between the values of 1 and -1.

Gnfc4wRlaa	The Earth's season are caused by its axial tilt.  Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees on its axis.  During the summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun is North of the Equator.  On the summer solstice, it is directly over the Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees north of the Equator.  This makes it warmer in the Northern Hemisphere (summer) and colder in the Southern Hemisphere (winter).

Now draw another line at right angles to the first. This represents the equator.    The ruled lines represent radiation coming from the sun. You will notice that, on one side of the circle, there are more lines meeting the earth above the equator than below it; and on the other side, the opposite is the case.    Each line represents an amount of solar energy reaching the earth, and each side of the circle represents the seasons six months apart. Notice how a lot more energy is received on one side of the equator to the other; and the situation is reversed on the opposite side.    This simple demonstration shows how the tilt of the earth causes seasonal variation.|`|MAruysqiaa	All of these answers are correct.

X0e6p9Ilaa	The magnitude of the heats of vaporization and condensation for a substance are the same.  If it takes 100 J/g to vaporize a substance at the boiling point, then 100 J/g will be released when it condenses to form the liquid at the boiling point.    Therefore, the answer is (2).  Don't be mislead by (4).  The question says, "magnitude", which ignores any sign differences based on whether the energy is absorbed or released.    ========= Follow up ==========    Ha, ha.  See I told you someone would be misled by (4), so apparently it was the item writer.  Apparently, the question writer really doesn't know the meaning of "magnitude".    In physics, which I have also taught for 36 years, we talk about vectors having both "magnitude and direction".  The magnitude is the "numerical" part of the vector.    Delta-H is like a vector in that has a magnitude, the number of kJ/mol, and a direction, either + or -, for endothermic or exothermic.  The magnitude will be the "number part" of the enthalpy if we use consistent notation.    Your question writer apparently is including the sign (read "direction") as part of the "magnitude" which is confusing for for a student who has also taken physics.  The question would have been better by simply removing references to "magnitude".    In that case the direction of the "heat flow" would be opposite and you would use negative sign so that they would both have the same direction and the "=" would be true.    It would be really nice if you question writer would use the "science words" consistently.|`|XZatdDHjaa	Vaporization is transition from liquid to gas, and condensation is transition from gas to liquid. Under isothermal and isobaric conditions (same temperature and pressure), the magnitude of the heats of vaporization and condensation will be the same. However, since they are opposite reactions (or mechanisms), the signs will be opposite as well, but the magnitudes will be the same.    The answer is  2.

nvc6D974aa	Black holes that have no angular momentum (spin) are spherical (they are known as either Schwarzschild black holes, if they also have no charge, or Reissner-Nordstrom black holes, if they are charged). Rotating black holes are more complicated as they additionally possess an "ergosphere"; the global structure of the black hole is no longer spherically symmetric. At least this is what is derived from solving Einstein's equations of general relativity. The actual truth might be radically different.|`|1jToUfoOaa	black holes have no shape because they are merely VOID, when you see the darkness which most people call black holes, that is merely the light near one of the voids that is being absorbed into it. Therefore, no, simply because there is no shape.|`|MAruysqiaa	It is very easy to derive from Einstein's equations that a non-rotating, non-charged black hole will be perfectly spherical.      Now, you could ask how to create a non-rotating black hole.  It's pretty difficult, they are all likely to be rotating.  If they're rotating, then the shape is little hard to describe but it's not spherical.    This nonsense about "not seeing one" or a void in space, is just that nonsense.  You'll never see one, so get over that.  A void in space, very much not true.  They are there, so it's not a void.|`|5al0K3N0aa	All black holes in nature are created as oblate spheroids (squashed spheres) resulting from the spin of the hole. A black hole is created from a star that goes supernova. The star is rotating (like stars do), but when they collapse the rate of spin increases through the conservation of angular momentum.     The inner event horizon of the black hole is spehical, and is surrounded by the ergosphere which is the space between the inner and outer event horizons. See picture...   http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Space/E...    These black hole are Kerr-Newmann solutions to Einstein's field equations that are more accurate to reality than the original Schwartzchild solutions.     Objects in the ergosphere are not fully captured by the black hole and are technically free to escape as they have not crossed the inner event horizon which is the true 'boudary of no return'.     As the black hole is so dense and rotating so quicky, spacetime frame dragging occurs noticably (like the water swirling down a plug-hole). The outer event horizon is the point where spacetime is dragged around the hole at the speed of light. As a result, observers on the outside of the hole (i.e. the rest of the Universe) will never actually observe matter 'falling into' the hole. The ergosphere contains the spacetime being dragged around faster than light speed (which is not forbidden by Special Relativity), but objects can still escape from it because they have not yet enetered the black hole. Energy can be sapped from the hole by matter which reduces the spin of the hole until the ergosphere essentially dissapears. The black hole will then be essentially spherical and the inner and outer event horizons become one.    This is beleived to be one of the mechanisms for the production of large amounts of energy in active galactic nuclei (quasars).    Also to the above, the suppermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy has been observed by using the Very Large Telescope by ESO. Images from a decade or so have been combined to show the star movements around the (invisible) black hole.    http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/Videos/Star...|`|Aty76cgqaa	Yes.    All matter with enough mass will gravitationally contract into a spheroid.     Before black holes were given this poor term, they were called black stars and dark stars.

iTqj9QCkaa	This is a straight forward algebra problem with two equations and two unknowns.  The unknowns are the number of dimes and the number of quarters.    The first equation:  d x 10 + q x 25 = 305   The second equation: d + q = 20  Solve the second equation for q.  q = 20 - d  Substitute that into the first equation.    d x 10 + (20 - d) x 25 = 305  Solve for d.  10d + 500 - 25d = 305  -15d = -195  d=195/15  d=13  Substitute into the solved second equation.  q = 20 - (13)  q = 7  Check by substituting into first equation.  (13) x 10 + (7) x 25 = 305 ?  130 + 175 = 305 ?  305 = 305|`|RZ19loF1aa	Well the first equation given would be  d + q = 20  since you have 20 coins.  The second equation would be 10 * d + 25 * q = 305. 10 cents times the number of dimes plus 25 cents times the number of quarters is 305 cents. You can then solve for q or d in the first equation, q = 20 - d  Then plug it into the second equation for q, 10d + 25(20-d) = 305. Now solve for d, 10d + 500 - 25d = 305 -> -15d = -195 -> d = 13. Now that you know you have 13 dimes, plug the value of d into the first equation to get 13 + q = 20  -> q = 7.  You'll have 13 dimes and 7 quarters.

Gnfc4wRlaa	No, we aren't.  Nothing is going to happen in 2012 any more than any other year.  I have watched the 2012 Doomsday program on the Hysteria Channel.  If you pay attention and listen carefully, you will hear all the "weasel words" like "may be", "could", etc.  The entire program was done that way. Their "experts" didn't actually say that anything was going to happen. They didn't give any actual Bible verses to support their theory, and all the Nostradamus "quotes" weren't what he actually wrote. They were what some people have decided that he meant. Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted. He never mentioned 2012.  Watching this program just confirmed what I already knew, that the whole 2012 hype is a silly scare tactic being promulgated to sell books.  There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years.   It is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice.  The current cycle ends December 21, 2012.  They didnt predict the end of the world, it was only the end of that cycle.  Nibiru (Planet X) doesn't exist. Zecharia Sitchin is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar.   Galactic Alignment  There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012.  It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012.  Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us.  The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.  Asteroid Apophis - the 2001 alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.  Polar Shift - the magnetic poles are moving all the time.  Polar reversals have occurred in the past, but we cant predict when they will occur again.    Passage through a "photon belt" has been added. This is also untrue and wouldn't hurt us if it were. Photons are merely units of light.  Solar flares happen all the time and we have more of them at some times than others. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions.

EgsuMGLPaa	Jellyfish lifespans typically range from a few hours (in the case of some very small hydromedusae) to several months. The life span and maximum size of each species is unique. One unusual species is reported to live as long as 30 years and another species, Turritopsis dohrnii as T. nutricula, is said to be effectively immortal because of its ability to transform between medusa and polyp, thereby escaping death[12]. Most of the large coastal jellyfish live about 2 to 6 months, during which they grow from a millimeter or two to many centimeters in diameter. They feed continuously and grow to adult size fairly rapidly. After reaching adult size (which varies by species), jellyfish spawn daily if there is enough food in the ecosystem. In most jellyfish species, spawning is controlled by light, so the entire population spawns at about the same time of day, often at either dusk or dawn.|`|3blw5udRaa	months.|`|4IuoAw8daa	How long do jellyfish live?    Jellyfish tend to live for about few months (3 to 4), depends on the species). If jellyfish dont live for about one year that is probably because another fish, turtle, or bird eats it. Another way they could die early is if they arent in salt water. Jellyfish have to be in salt water to be able to live.    Most sea animals are decreasing from the amount of pollution in the water. Jellyfish have been increasing for the past 10 years. That means that the pollution hasnt harmed the jellyfish yet. We dont know yet if pollution will affect the jellyfish later on.        Life cycle  The early life cycle of the jellyfish is similar to, though not identical to, coral. Larvae are carried through the water until they find a hard surface onto which to attach, such as a rock or shell. These then develop into polyps, which, at this stage, resemble sea anemones.    Horizontal grooves then begin to form and deepen until the polyp is transformed into a stack of individuals, like a stack of pancakes. These flattened polyps break off the stack, one by one, and swim away, now starting to look more like adult jellyfish.    Jellyfish have a short lifespan, the longest surviving species living only two to six months, usually perishing in rough waters or being eaten by predatorsocean sunfish and leatherback turtles are two of the most prevalent jellyfish predators. (Researchers do not know how turtles and other predators can eat poisonous nematocysts without harming themselves.5,6)    Jellyfish are incredibly fragile, yet also incredibly complex. They breathe through the entire surface of their bodies, which is able to absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide, and, even after death, are able to continue to deliver poison from their stingers if the tentacles remain moist.|`|XEljolthaa	jellyfish tend to live for about a year, unless some animal eats it first....|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	Ask it, it may tell you.

P544Sbmqaa	The article you have is biased unfairly towards adult stem cells.  First it mentions that embryonic stem cells are immunogenic because a person is likely to reject stem cells from an random embryo, but then states that adult stem cells are not immunogenic because there are no rejection issues when using your own stem cells...   That is a Biased statement.  When you use donor adult stem cells, and almost all adult stem cell treatments use donors, they ARE immunogenic and rejection and gvhd ARE a possibility.     It is also a biased article  because it has the dates wrong.  It was actually first thought that the marrow was stem cells in the very early 1900s, like 1908.  The first succesful bone marrow transplant was in the late 50s.  They couldnt do the transplant reliably until the 60s. So that article makes it sound as if they have been able to use adult stem cells reliable since they were discovered, and that is far from the truth.    Also, when it says embryonic stem cells cause tumors..  that is in the earliest embryonic stem cell research done in rats.  Remember that we have yet to start the first human trial using embryonic stem cells.  We havnt had a succesful treatment in humans because no trial has ever been conducted.  Also remember the dates with adult stem cells again.  It was 40 years before the first succesful treatment after the discovery that marrow was stem cells.  Is it fair to call the research over with less than 10 years in embryonic stem cell research??  On top of that, hematopoetic stem cell transplants (medically correct term for a bone marrow transplant), the treatment in a majority of the 70+ diseases that can be treating using adult stem cells, still kill a HUGE amount of people during the transplant.      It says embryonic stem cells and germ cells are morally objectionable because it uses dead embryos and fetuses.  IF you concur with that, you ALSO have to be against abortion altogether, against IVF, and againt hormonal birth control, because ALL of those result in dead embryos and fetuses.    The paragraph that debates religion v biology as the basis for the beginning of life...  The response against the religious arguement is that Biblically life begins when the baby takes a breath of air.  And that is STRAIGHT from Genesis.  Adam was already created, but was not alive until God breathed the air of life in him.  Biologically, embryos have no form, no organs, no heart beat and no cns...  they are not human.      To the myths...    Their stance with  1 is correct.  A huge majority of people think all stem cells come from embryos, and that is precisly because of the media.    They are correct with number two as well.  However, what they leave out is they ONLY support the germ cell category when its a miscarriage, they do not support germ cells when it comes from an abortion.    I have pretty much already discussed what they talked about in 3.  There isnt any succesful embryonic stem cell treatments for humans yet because there havent been any human trials yet.  Lets not forget that it took them 40 years to have ONE succesful bone marrow transplant, and another 10-15 years before they could get succesful transplants reliably, and today, a large number of patients STILL die going through the transplant, and that transplant is the treatment in a majority of the 70+ diseases that can be treated with adult stem cells to date.    What they say about 4 is correct. I dont know about 4 5 or 6.    My rebuttal to 7...  No, hand washing isnt really the same, BUT hormonal birth control IS.  The only people I have met personally who are against both embryonic stem cell research AND hormonal birth control are Catholics.  I have met MANY people against embryonic stem cell research who support and even use hormonal birth control measures.  One of the measures in ALL hormonal birth control is to thin the endometrial lining in order to prevent an embryo from implanting.  That measure is there in case the first couple fail.  And with non hormonal iud's, the ONLY measure is to thin the endometrial lining to prevent the embryo from implanting.  Interesting they left that arguement out of the article completly.

Do you mean differentail calculus? integral calculus?   Differential calculus is about slope, minimum and maximums, optimums.  DO you think that has any bearing on "real life"?  If you're going to screw nuts onto electric cars for a living then you certainly don't need calculus. Flip burgers, cut hair, shine shoes, sell cars - don't need it.  Integral calculus is about summing up of parts to make wholes.

2xdj1KMPaa	I'll try my best to explain.There is no male and female plant...but plants differ my their reproductive parts..In the female reproductive plant,there is a stigma,an ovary and ovules.In the male reproductive part,there are anthers which contain pollen grains.You might think that even though plants have male and female reproductive parts why they arent classified into male or females?The thing is that sometimes plants have noth the male and female part together in 1 flower.Next time you see a flower,notice if it has the anther(the stick with the yellowish pollen grains at its end) or the ovary(stick which is spherical in the bottom and a t shaped thingy(the stigma)on the top.Hope you understood me..|`|WJjfrf0Caa	read this  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_sexua...    scroll down to INDIVIDUAL PLANT SEXUALITY  all of the classifications are there|`|4VrKKOwnaa	the female plants produce the more potent 'bud'|`|dtZiXpqNaa	ask your parents|`|E8go0osDaa	I don't think plants are classified under gender...|`|H0LfFGmlaa	The female ones are more needy and die if you don't get them what they need right away.|`|8vWwX8SXaa	Female = Long tube (style) with sticky stigma on it  Male = Filament with anther on it with pollen on it    You all are SPAMMEEERRRZZZ except one or two|`|ROWNVIUVaa	The gender would be the difference, silly.|`|ujT5teZgaa	there is none|`|xfj1B7YSaa	male plant has a penis and female plant has a vagina! woo!|`|AOBEkqzXaa	the boy plants have penises and the girl plants have vaginas....

There is a difference, a significant difference. I may be a bit wrong but I'll explain it. Last year we did this so don't yell at me. Basically the female plant has an ovary, and something that begins with an a which collects the pollen which is actually plant sperm cells. Which is called pollination. (thats why there is two genders) the male has something I think called the anther, which has the sperm cells in it, (which is basically the whole male sex part) some plants though are asexual which means they can pollinate themselves because they have both the anther and the Pistil which is the female part.

The inability to distinguish the difference is part of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.|`|pInY6rYqaa	The elevator is at rest because the books and the elevator are moving within the same inertial frame of reference.    Whenever the elevator cahnages its velocity, the acceleration (positive or negative) will alter that 80 Newton reading.|`|c9UgoQ3Vaa	This information tells you that the elevator is not accelerating- it could be stationary, but it could also be moving up or down at a constant speed.|`|AA11602341	Yes and no. Constant velocity means no acceleration, and F = ma, so the elevator would not contribute to or counteract gravitation acceleration. But, you would be able to tell when the elevator started moving up or down due to inertia on the book.|`|256fe92c1f48eeee32f2750edc89baafaa	You cannot tell.  The scale measures force.  When the elevator starts to accelerate upward it (the scale) will have to apply a little force to the books to accelerate them.  But once the elevator is moving at a constant velocity only the force of gravity will be acting and the scale will measure the mass of the books times the force of gravity.  When the elevator starts down some of the force of gravity goes into accelerating the books downward but once it reaches a constant velocity all of the force of gravity and only the force of gravity is pushing the books against the scale and it will read 80N times the force of gravity.  Obviously when the elevator is standing still only the force of gravity is acting.  So, if you weren't looking at the scale when the elevator started to move and the elevator is now moving at a constant velocity there is no way to tell if that velocity is up, down, or zero.

Depending on the angle of the slice, this leaves us with only circles and ellipses for plane shapes.    If it is an IRREGULAR 2 faced solid you will end up with some type of CLOSED CURVE. (Circles and ellipses are also closed curves.)    {If you include two infinite cones placed nose-to-nose on the same central line and make a slice (this might not satisfy your definition of a 2 faced solid,) you also have parabolas and hyperbolas.}|`|RZF5KgiEaa	The wording of your question seems to involve a solid with only two faces.

BDKqYOSraa	Erythrocyte sedementation rate (ESR or "sed rate") is the measure of red blood cells that settle in a test tube over a set time period.  It is a very vague measure of systemic inflammation.  (Greater inflammation= faster/higher RBC sedementation=higher ESR)    Mild elevations in ESR can be caused by almost anything.  An infection can cause it.    A very high ESR might reinforce a physician's suspicion that a patient has a very serious autoimmune (eg. Lupus), infectious (eg. osteomyelitis) or malignant (eg. leukemia) condition.    ESR is never specific to one condition.  ESR is like seeing smoke on the horizon: You know there is a fire. Is it a house, a barn, a building or a forest on fire? The smoke doesn't tell you... and neither does the ESR. ESR just urges you to look closer.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	A sed rate of 40 might mean you were sick, though it's a completely non-specific test and won't give a hint about why. 17 means nothing at all.  I like that smoke analogy.|`|vVTmJjJDaa	Moderately elevated ESR occurs with inflammation, but also with anemia, infection, pregnancy, and old age.  Females tend to have higher ESR, and menstruation and pregnancy can cause *temporary* elevations.     A very high ESR usually has an obvious cause, such as a marked increase in globulins that can be due to a severe infection. The doctor will use other follow-up tests, such as cultures, depending on the patients symptoms.     In most cases, the ESR will decrease over time once the underlying inflammation is addressed. If you have a chronic inflammatory disease, the ESR may fluctuate with the degree of activity your condition.

U4J22obgaa	Gases are supossed to contain more energy compared to liquids  When we boil water it requires energy to change its state and the gases have more energy and volume compared to water.  When the spray is sprayed there is a state change, the liquid in side the can is changed to gas. Since gas need more energy is takes in the heat from the environment or our hand,   We feel cold when our body loses heat.    The idea of the change of liquids to gases absorbing more heat is used in fridges, ari conditionars and hyper cooling uints.    This process is known as rapid freezing.  Note: Our hand don't freeze but it feels cooler.           Hyper cooling unit are dangerous and can freeze anything.    (Great Question)|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	Because the propellant is a compressed gas (liquid form). When you depress the nozzle, you reduce the pressure, so the propellant can boil and evaporate. Evaporation requires energy (breaking the liquid bond), so it absorbs heat to do so.|`|AA10841459	PV=nrT   n and r are constant so PV=T    Pressure x Volume  = Temperature.    Since the aerosol is at high pressure in a low volume it is in a liquid state.  Changing from a liquid to a gas requires energy, the energy is taken in from the surroundings, and the sensation of cold is felt.    As the pressure decreases from the can to the air, the volume increases even more greatly from liquid to gas, the difference is a change in temperature that requires ambient energy.

1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	Okay, in elementary calculus texts, any function that has a point with an indefinite slope is termed a "non-differential function".  For example, y = x^(1/3) has an infinite slope at x = 0, so texts call this a "non-differentiable function", even though it has a definite slope everywhere else for finite x.  However, mathematical papers discussing "non-differentiable functions" are usually talking about functions which are continuous everywhere and yet do not have a definite slope anywhere.  Check, for example, the Weirstrass Function (see link).  This is closely related to, but not exactly the same as, a function not having a derivative at every point, because functions not having a derivative at every point may not even be continuous anywhere.     The idea of a function that is "non-dfferentiable" because of one or few pathological points is trivial, and almost never worthy of study in serious mathematical papers on this subject.    Edit: As a matter of fact, even the function x has everywhere a definite derivative, if one includes infinities and complex numbers.  It is a well-behaved function in the complex plane.|`|7b18720ac35ea925d44408ba012ff709aa	Sounds to me kinda like a trick question.

I made a pretty impressive powerpoint for them to complete their labelled diagrams.  We did the upper body one day and the lower the next.      I then gave them an enlarged halloween pattern of a skeleton.  The total skeleton put together was over 3 feet long.  The kids then had to color code each bone and make a color key.  They also had to write the names of bones on the back.  The skeleton was put together using 10 brass fasteners.  This allowed the completed skeleton to be used as a study tool allowing someone to quiz the student.  (ie "What is the blue bone?  "What is the orange bones in the wrist?", etc.)    The kids seemed to enjoy this because they had to carefully look at the skeleton ("is the radius on the thumb side or pinkie side? vs The radius is on the outside/inside.  This depends on which way the hands are facing).    Also, 8th graders don't get many opportunities to do art crafts.  The total activity took 2 50 minute periods.
D0znfBeXaa	The volume of the solid formed by rotating a region about   the x-axis is given by  V = pi*[a;b]  y2 dx.    Lets consider first what represents the graph of the   function  y = 1-x2.    After squaring both sides we obtain  y2 = 1 - x2 or  x2 + y2 = 1.    This is equation of a circle with centre at the origin and   radius R=1. Therefore y = 1-x2 represents upper   semicircle, -1  x  1, y>0.    Now we can calculate volume and as the region bounded by   y=1-x2  and y=0 is symmetrical with respect to y-axis   we can calculate volume as double integral from 0 to 1:    V = pi*[a;b]  y2 dx = pi*[-1;1]  (1-x2 )2 dx =    = 2 pi*[0;1]  (1-x2) dx = 2pi*(x - x3/3) [0;1] =    = 2pi * (1  1/3) = 2pi * 2/3 = 4pi/3.    From other side the solid of revolution in this case is   simply a sphere. Geometrically the volume of the sphere is   V = 4/3*pi*R3 .    In our case R = 1, so V = 4/3*pi and it is the same result   we obtained by integrating.    Good luck!

IUmAflSqaa	We have the cubic curve:    y = x^3-7x+6    We have the line:    y = -4x+8    We want to see where they intersect.  The typical strategy is to set them equal:    x^3-7x+6 = -4x+8    x^3-3x-2 = 0    Okay, now what?  You probably haven't learned a general method of factoring cubics.  But we have some extra info!  We already have one point of intersection, namely (-1,12).  So x+1 has to be a factor of this expression.  (Better yet--(x+1)^2 has to be a factor, since the line is tangent at this point.)  So either:    1. Divide through by x+1 using long division or synthetic division, and then factor the cubic that's left.    2. Divide through by x+1 twice.    3. Divide through by (x+1)^2.    You'll find the other x-coordinate in no time, and then plug it back in to one of the equations to get the y-coordinate of the other point of intersection|`|foHdTbnaaa	Just solve the equations simultaneously.

KfqSAr90aa	"The question is calculate the p(G) given p(E) --> p(G I E)"    p(G|E) is the probability of G given that you know what E is (ie that event E occurred or not), not that you know what the probability of E is.    I don't exactly follow the underlying science you're referring to, but it seems you are using p(G) to represent 2 different events.  One with the 1st base is G and the other is that a nucleotide is CA or CC.    Since p(A) + p(T) + p(C) + p(G) = 1 then they are all mutually exclusive.  This is not the same as independent.    E and G are not independent based on how it is described here.  If E occurs then G can't and P(G|E) = 0    Maybe a bit more explanation?    Edit:    OK I think I understand now.  The only remaining question is whether order counts, ie if CA = AC.  I do't think it's an important issue, though and I gather that order does count.    I don't see why G and E are independent, which would be required for P(G|E) = P(G).  Since event E is C or T and G excludes T then the conditional probabilities should diverge.    Let's look at Bayes Theorem:    P(G|E) = P(E|G)*P(G) / P(E)    I am presuming that P(G) means that event C occurs 1st and event (A or C) occurs 2nd.    Thus P(E|G) = 1 since given that event G occurs then event E must have also occurred.    (by event I mean the particular nucleotide is chosen).    P(G|E) = 1*P(G) / .5    P(G|E) = 2*P(G)    Therefore G and E are not independent.
