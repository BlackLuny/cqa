I learned it from article published at site:  http://www.stargazing.net/kepler/altaz.h...       But then, I begin to wonder is there some elegant way, like previous (above mentioned), to do next:      1) Finding out LONG and LAT (i.e. our position on the globe), if we know RA and Dec of the observed object, we know UT, and we know ALT and AZ of the observed object.      2) Finding out RA and Dec of the observed object, if we know ALT and AZ of the observed object, we know UT, and we know LONG and LAT (i.e. our position on the globe).         Please, tell me, is it possible to express smooth formulas for unknown values at 1) and 2) ?      Thanks

Here it goes:       The rate constant of a reaction is 4.7 x 10^-3 s^-1 at 25 degrees Celsius, and the activation energy is 3.6 kJ/mol. What is K (rate constant) at 75 degrees Celsius?       I have an equation that involves two K values:       Ea= -R[ln(k2/k1)][(1/T2 - 1/T1)]^1            I hope that is not to confusing. I do not know how to solve for k2 (K subscript 2) or k1. If there is another equation, I do not know what it is. I am new to this so I need it to broken down fairly simply if R ll possible haha.       Thank you VERY MUCH in advance for your help with this.       SIncerely,       Justin
20090220042851AABfI3g	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Chemistry Problem - Collision Theory?	Here is yet another problem I can not seem to figure out. I missed a day of class, and it is amazing how far behind you can get after missing only one lecture. Here it goes:      In the reaction AB + CD  --->/<---  EF, (arrow pointing towards products and reactants) 4x10^-5 mol of AB molecules collide with 4x10^-5 mol of CD molecules. Will 4x10^-5 mol of EF form? Explain.      And there you have it. I am not really sure where to start on this one. The text does not do a very good job explaining it in a way that I can understand.       Thank you very much in advance for you help on this.       Sincerely,      Justin

In my high school, we have get to chose advanced courses or general courses. Advanced is the harder level, which most people take, and applied is very easy... usually for people who are going to college (or community college. I'm from canada and we say college :) )       Anyway, I took advanced in everything. But my main problem is math. I'm soooo bad at math. Apparently if you're bad at math, then you should switch down to general. But I don't know if I want to do that. Do you think it's best for a student to just give up and switch down or do you think I should stay in the harder level? I don't know if I can do it... i need a positive mind, a good tutor and good study habits.

20090203123239AApgcZC	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Abstract Algebra:  In an element of a ring R is not a zero divisor, does that imply that it IS a unit?	I know that zero divisors cannot be units, but I'm not sure if a non zero divisor has to be a unit.      Actually, my first thought is no it doesn't have to be a unit.  All you need is a ring without 1 without zero divisors.  However, are examples of this easy and readily available? yes 2Z is a ring where every element is a nonzero divisor and there are NO units.        So let me refine my question.  WHEN, i.e. , in what rings is it true that a non zero divisor will be a unit  (beside the obvious answer in a field).  And lastly, is this a good question do you think?  thanks

From that i get the y-intercept equaling 40 but that isn't the answer - the book says the y-intercept is (0, 3 and 1/3) and also by looking at the graph a y-intercept of 40 looks impossible.      y = 1/12x + c   4 = 1/12(8) + c   48 = 8 + c   c = 40 ???

20090220041131AAaYSPq	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	The effect of concentration on the rate of a reaction?	I have done an experiment to investigate the rate of a reaction for my GCSE Chemistry. I reacted magnesium ribbon with 5 different concetrations of hydrochloric acid (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 molar). I used 10 cubic centimetres of acid each time. The acid was in excess for the 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 molar experiments. The rate of hyrodgen gas produced for the initial part of the reaction is as follows:      - 0.2M =    0.02625 cubic centimetres per second   - 0.4M =    0.07916 cubic centimetres per second   - 0.6M =    0.22666 cubic centimetres per second   - 0.8M =    0.44333 cubic centimetres per second   - 1.0M =    0.66250 cubic centimetres per second      So why was it not directly proportional? I controlled the surface area of the magnesium and temperature. I used the same volume of acid and magnesium each time.

20090220072526AAdYEwJ	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Transformative universe or anomalous universe?	After soliciting a flood of responses yesterday, I am now gloating in my role as provocateur, and since so many responses included so many counter-provocations, my question today is… TRANSFORMATIVE or ANOMALOUS? The assertion that big bang origin is ‘anomalous’ does not square with me. I do not believe any discovery, knowledge or observation suggests anything about the universe is ever anomalous (THIS IS NOT A CREATION ARGUMENT -- do I really have to say this every time? Okay, you’re right, I really do have to say that every time --), and even quantum physics that convincingly demonstrate material routinely emerges from ‘nothing’ do not automatically establish the occurrence as anomalous (especially if “experiments PRODUCE the results”), (and even MORE especially, if it happens more than once!) while conversely, an abundance of evidence suggests everything about the universe is always transformative (a big bang is not automatically contrary to transformation). I do not contend any of this constitutes a convincing argument that the big bang is conclusively a transformative event, but I think my concession ought garner a reciprocal concession that any contention the big bang is anomalous is equally arbitrary speculation.      I am not arguing that the universe is conclusively transformative – I am arguing that the universe is NOT DEMONSTRABLY anomalous, and any insistence that it is anomalous or more likely anomalous is not a ‘theory’ but a BELIEF.      Okay? Now give me a big wind up and hit me with the chin music.      … and just to make things more amenable, I revise my initial question from true / false format to multiple choice…      THE UNIVERSE?      (A) TRANSFORMATIVE   (B) ANOMALOUS   (C) INDETERMINABLE (which means you have to stop calling it ‘anomalous’)       http://www.nokilleye.com/111000.htm

20090220065228AAmUDAc	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Thermodynamics question?	I'm looking at the reaction for the formation of ammonia from its elements at 25 degrees Celsius. The enthalpy change for the reaction is -93 KJ/Mol. The standard free-energy change for the reaction is -33.2KJ/mol.   How can 93 KJ/Mol of heat be released to the surroundings but only 33 KJ be available to do useful work? Does that mean that only 33 Kj of heat is actually released to the surroundings? I understand that some energy gets stuck in the product molecules for this reaction (Vibrations/spinning etc....) so that Delta G is less than Delta H but I don't understand the heat/actual energy relationship.

(b) The thermometer reads 0.63 degrees C higher than it should over the whole temperature range.   (c) the test tube is not dry 9and has water drops inside) before the solutions are made up.      I think the answer for the last one is that the extra water will add mass to the water, thereby changing the molality.

20090220023041AApTRqY	Science & Mathematics;Agriculture	Can human decomposition be beneficial to farming soil?	Sorry if this is a freaky question. It's for a class assignment. I'm offering my own "Modest Proposal" and it has to deal with burying people in farmlands. But anyways, I'm not sure if that mine makes sense because I don't know if the human decomposition process will actually benefit soil and farmland. I was thinking since the decomposition process can help trees and fungi grow in forests, couldn't it also help grow crops? Or would it spoil the food and make it inedible?

20090220061606AAYKhP5	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Probability Question? 10 points, help?	From past experience, a wheat farmer living in Manitoba, Canada finds that his annual profit (in Canadian dollars) is $80,000 if the summer weather is typical, $50,000 if the weather is unusually dry, and $20,000 if there is a severe storm that destroys much of his crop.      Weather bureau records indicate that the probability is 0.70 of typical weather, 0.20 of unusually dry weather, and 0.10 of a severe storm.      Let X be the farmer's profit in the coming year. Construct a probability distribution for the farmer's profit to answer the following questions.      A) What is the probability that the farmer's profit is $50,000 or more?      B) How much profit should the farmer expect to make in the coming year?      C) Suppose the farmer buys insurance for $3000 that pays him $25,000 in the event of a severe storm that destroys much of the crop, and pays nothing otherwise. Adjust the probability distribution to account for this. If the farmer purchases this insurance, how much profit should the farmer expect to make in the coming year?      Hint: If the farmer purchases insurance and there is a severe storm that destroys most of his crop, then the farmer will get $25,000 insurance money, in addition to the $20,000 that he would make if a severe storm destroyed most of his crop.      Hint: If the farmer purchases insurance, the cost of the insurance has to be considered in determining his profit, regardless of what the weather is like that year.

20090220072214AAn1Sqr	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Two capacitors are charged individually.?	two capacitors C1= 6.1 uF, C2= 16 uF are charged individually to V1= 18.3 V, V2= 7.8 V.  the two capacitors are then connected together in parallel with the positive plates together and the negative plates together.      1.   Calculate the final potential difference across the plates of the capacitors once they are connected.      2.   Calculate the amount of charge (absolute value) that flows from one capacitor to the other when the capacitors are connected together.      3.    By how much (absolute value) is the total stored energy reduced when the two capacitors are connected.
20090220072429AAeaLmE	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Details of submarine?	I am doing a project Finite Element Analysis for buckling of thin cylindrical shell subjected to uniform external pressure.I need some application for submitting my project. I have an opinion submarine hulls are example of thin shells . My radius to thickness ratio is 400. I need a proof  for saying submarines are thin shells and the material used for making of submarine hulls. The material i have taken for my analysis is structural steel with a yields limit of 240 N/mm^2. Please help me with some metal with this yield limited and also suitable for submarine hulls or any thin shell application with radius to thickness ratio 400.
