20090202092713AAa3yPr	Sports;Football (American)	Why didn't James Harrison win the Super Bowl MVP?	Santonio Holmes did a fabulous job as well, but Harrison had that game changer right before the half to give Pit that extra boost making the score 17-7. Also by getting that INT, Harrison prevented the Cardinals from scoring on their drive. I think it's because Harrison plays defense and the Super Bowl MVP voters never show the defensive players enough respect. How is a 100 yd game changing INT touchdown along with several tackles, tip balls, etc. not better than only 9 catches for 131 and 1 TD. I think it's also because Holmes had the most crucial TD late in the game, but the MVP should have belonged to Harrison because his play was one of those major impact play that can have on a course of a football game.

20090202090152AA5Wf7X	Sports;Football (American)	Do you think they should've reviewed Warner's fumble?	The Steelers played the better game and they deserve to be the Super Bowl Champs, and Im not a fan of either team nor do I dislike either team, and infact I like both teams so this is an unbaised approach.      The last play should've at least been reviewed so there were no doubts or questions left to ask about it. They may have got the call right even though it feel it was incomplete but why leave any doubts and not verify or make sure your call was correct. The play should've at least been reviewed. If it turns out it was incomplete they ruined which could've been an exciting hail mary ending, not saying that they would've converted it, not to mention the ball wouldve been on about the 36 after that celebration penalty.      Why didnt they review the play? It may've been correct but they should've at least verified it so there werent any doubts. Whyd they not review it?

That pass was not a fumble because his arm was going forward and the ref should have called it Incomplete pass. Do you think that Holmes touch down was incomplete because he went out of bounds while catching the ball in the end zone. I want sports to have no more bad calls because it messes everybody up. I want all calls in sports be right not wrong. My point is this: Kurt Warner arm was going forward   and was incomplete pass. Holmes Catch the ball while out of bounds, that play is incomplete pass. What do you think.

I'm not a Steelers or Cardinals fan but the calls were going one way and that was too the Steelers.       Key Points:   1. James Harrison touchdown should have been brought back because Tim Hightower was blocked in the back during the play. *check it on youtube*   2. Roughing the Passer called on Arizona when a linemen is rushing in full speed and you're asking him not to touch the big QB? The ball was barely out of his hands.   3. Last play not being reviewed? Even if it was a fumble or not, for it not be reviewed or questioned is utterly ridiculous.

How hard would that have been to swallow, but the reffing was horrible to both the cards and the steelers but more to the cards (those of u pitt fans who dont see the bad calls to the cards are obviously super biased) but i just felt like cards had to challenge every single bad call just to keep it a fair game, Sure the cards d failed to step itup when it count in the end but when the cards offense was back on.....to not even give the last play a review,...WOW....not that it would have changed the outcome but at least let the cards get a descent chance, dont let the pitt win be another questionable superbowl win........sry just ranting      But would u rather have the refs in the first denver vs. chargers game during the season??? or the superbowl reffing crew??

They were way too hard on Arizona and Pittsburgh did not deserve the win. I am not being biast, I am a Detroit Lions fan, but I think the last play where Warner supposedly fumbled was a forward pass and at the very least should have been reviewed.  Also, the last Pittsburgh touchdown, I think only one foot was touching the ground. On the replay you could clearly see one foot was on top of the other. I thought it was an exciting superbowl but Arizona got screwed.  Tell me your opinions.

But then I found out that Breast Stroke and 400 to 800 metres running is my natural talent, I mean, I always win these races in most competitions, and my other strokes are all fast, but not CRAZY fast like Breast Stroke. I have great durability and can RUN not jog 800 metres in 2 minutes and 34 seconds in my quickest personal record so far.      Furthermore, idk why, I just like training Breast stroke as it kinda makes me feel free for some reason, due to the speed. Plus it' s less tiring then the other strokes.      The only problem is, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO MY MUSCLES? Will they look as nice as to when I train EVERYTHING? Or will only training the sports that I'm naturally good at make me stronger and look better- (In Body).      I also trains martial arts allot and is planning to take on another competition, though what would be the effect of training Breast stroke and 800 metres only?

I reckon the Arizona Cardinals won't make the super bowl again for another 10 - 20 years and they will prolli vs the titans and hopefully they will win this time around. I think they blew their one and only chance to win the super bowl for a very long time.

20090203004738AAXyg34	Sports;Football (Soccer);Other - Soccer	Was Keane A Victim Of An Anfield Power Struggle?	I really do feel bad for Robbie Keane. On sky sports I was listening to comments by Liverpool fans and they called Keane's move disgusting. I can't believe Rafa treated him like that. I think Rafa was being stubborn he had the mentality "oh he is my player and I will use him when I want". I can say with hand on heart that the nine draws they had this season at least four of them should have been wins if Rafa had decided to use Keane. Look at Berbatov he struggled at united but Ferguson kept playing him and it payed off. I think Rafa wanted Barry instead.
