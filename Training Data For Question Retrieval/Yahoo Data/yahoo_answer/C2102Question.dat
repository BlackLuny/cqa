Really annoying when you ask a question and finding out the answer opens up a link when you access it.

20090305085410AAuPJEd	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	How Can I report a Person?	I have found someone who keeps being racist, in fact they keep calling Yahoo Answers things like 'america this or american that. They basically think that the people that moderate Yahoo answers are just out to get them. When in fact she has been posting racist questions, swearing people that actually try and have another view, she is inciting hatred and racism. And I have noticed that her questions havent even been removed? And the amount of times they call the answerer's with the F word and other things, there's just no respect for other people.    I can only view her questions when im logged out, as she has blocked me.

20090304101955AAhuazk	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Quick answer needed here - is this speech reasonable?	Is a summary speech against the death penalty. I'm having a minor panic attack over it and if I want to change it I have about 2 days. I'm not fishing for compliments any constructive criticism would be fantastic. Don't worry about grammar, I'm more panicky about structure.      Honorable members, our views have clashed many times over the course of this debate. You say that it is right for a person who has taken a life to have his or her life taken in return.      However the fact remains that the death penalty is morally wrong. A life for a life is not a philosophy to encourage, and would only serve to make people think that if someone have done wrong then they deserves to be hurt too. As Gandhi famously said “an eye for an eye and the whole world shall be blind” Why do you think gang violence in this country never seems to end? It is important to send a message to society that striking back at your enemy purely for revenge will always make matters worse.     Secondly, you also say that the death penalty acts a deterrent. It most certainly does not.  In the USA the homicide rate is lower in the states that do not have the death penalty than those which do. When people are executed they become an icon to others and people may if anything start to feel sympathy towards the criminal, who becomes a martyr      In my last chance to convince you of my views I summarize our parties points.   The death penalty is an infringement of our human rights put in place by our democratic society. Every person has a right not to fear the sentence of death, a right to life.  However hard we hard we try we cannot eliminate the risk of wrongful conviction, and innocent people could be put to death before the truth is uncovered. The pain that the execution could cause to both the victims and the criminals family is immense. The victim’s family will have had their revenge but will feel hollow when this revenge does not bring their loved one back. The criminal’s family will never be able to accept the death and will feel bitter and confused for the rest of their lives. There is also no form of execution that is completely humane and before death the criminal will experience of great pain. A better punishment is to give the person a life sentence with parole, and make them live with their crime for the rest of their life.      Our Criminal justice system was put in place to provide fair verdicts, not to murder..   I conclude this speech be asking the house to reject this bill.

20090304185013AAviB5m	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Accounts & Passwords	Account suspended, wtf?	Hi,      On my account that I use regularly, I asked a question about rape and it's definition. Basically, a definition I got for rape (to answer a similar question) was "the insertion of a p*nis, finger, or tongue into an an*s, v*gina, or mouth". According to this definition, if you stuck your finger in someone's mouth against their will, you could be charged with rape. I was asking if this was true. This was apparently "adult" content, yet people posting questions about sex positions don't get their accounts suspended!      Was this right?      Will I get my account back, or has it been permanently terminated?         (sorry a/b the stars, not taking ANY chances!)

20090227052615AAoHQd4	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Spam & Bulk Mail	Match.com scam???????????????	My dad joined match.com a week ago and a woman instant messaged him immediately. They talked for hours on end and after basically a couple days she asked him for $300. I was very suspicious because she claims to make 70 to 100,000 dollars and year and why would she need a loan. She is "in cairo" for a business trip and i thought that if she could afford that she doesnt need any money. Then she started saying i love you to him after 4 days. Her phone number belongs to a guy in new jersy and there are nobody with her name living where she claims she is living. She claims her name is audrey chloe. Now she is asking for an ipod touch and its been 6 days. My dad wont believe my judgement. do i have enough reasons to be worried????

20090305101902AA423d8	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Groups	What is wrong with Search function in Groups?	I am member of various groups. In most members have noticed Search function malfunctioning for some weeks now.       eg. recent posts not showing up up at when searched for whether by title or author.      Now it seems that the search function has stopped working altogether??      This is  not just very annoying it also makes finding posts & info virtually impossible particularly in groups with large number of members & numerous daily posts.      When is Yahoo going to fix this seemingly ongoing & widespread problem?????
