20090225101237AACgpHx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend broke up with me she said she does not want to be with me but i think she does but its hard?	she told me last night she does not want to be with me but i think she does its just hard she says we see each other everyday were always together we talkd for over a year before we seen each other because i was living in another city and i finally moved down here to be with her everything was ok and now it just fell apart she says she sees me to much but her friend is at her house everyday before i am its like she pays more attention to her friend than me so should i wait for her to come back or?
20090225101419AA83VR5	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I feel guilt and embarrassed about this problem?	I feel some sort of guilt because me and my sister had a violent fight yesterday over something stupid and immature. It was really her that started it and it was because she disrespects my things by destroying them and stealing. She starts to attack me and stabbing me with a sharp object, which caused me to go to the hospital. I feel bad because I'm 22 yrs old and she's my sister, but i had to defend myself. Since I'm not a fighter at all, I feel embarrassed about it because it makes me feel weak and more of an easy target (which is why she did what she did). She already has a criminal record and is rebellious, so I called the police on her for assault. Based on what I just said, should I feel bad or did I handle this right?
20090225101422AAq4mwS	Family & Relationships;Friends	I made a photoshopped mag cover with my friends pic and put man of the year, need ideas on what to write there?	So it's for my best friend, got the idea when I saw a picture. I know it would be very ego boosting for him to see man of the year and it's like Time magazine cover. Now what do I write like 1 or 2 sentences why, I really have no idea, something like he beat every record known to mankind, so that's like why he's so awesome... I need more ideas that one just sounds crap!

20090227112707AA7qkhs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want to be more fun for my boyfriend?	We've been together for a year and a half, we used to have so much fun together just doing silly things but now I just feel like he'd be having more fun if he was with his friends. I feel as though he's a bit bored of me, recently I've been becoming more and more quiet and I don't know why, I just want my spark back- whatever it was that used to make me fun to him. I realise that after a year and a half I can't expect everything to be the same and right now it would be wrong to expect him to put any extra effort in as he's going through a lot of stuff at home that must be really hard.   I just get so upset when I can't seem to make him smile the way his friends do anymore.   We're only 17 and can't drive and obviously don't have much money so I need suggestions of realistic things I could do to show him that I'm still fun and that I love him.   I want to make him smile with dimples again.
20090227113032AAra2xs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think I should send him a message?	So me and my crush bumped into each other last night at the coffee house. He likes me and I like him back but I'm a freshman and he's a junior. We hung out and it was really cool. He offered me a ride home. I said no thank you. He ran away quickly before I could explain that my dad was waiting outside for me. So now he probably thinks I don't like him (which I do) and rejected him. Think I should send him a friendly message explaining?             P.S. Haha, it really sucked. It's not every day that you get an offer from your crush who's extremely nice and a junior to ride in his Mustang alone with him.

I'm known to be hard-headed and hard-to-get. And I believe that if you have a boyfriend (at this age) then you're insecure with yourself and you only need someone there to tell you you're pretty all the time. Anyway this guy kept asking me out all this week. I said "I'll hang out with you." he was like "okay". He's liked me for a while now. He seems to have alot of friends and may go tell the world. I want to know does he get I'm not interested or does he think we're acctually going to get somewhere? 'Cuz I don't feel teh way he feels about me. I only want to be friends. Not like in love friends of whatever.

20090225101542AAbLIJC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this any of my mother's business?	My mom found out that I am dating a guy who is in the process of divorce, and no, it's not because of me. He lives with me, and we are quite happy. My mother has informed me that she needs to talk to me and is writing me a letter because she won't even call me about it. She never even asked me about anything, everything she thinks she knows she just assumed from the limited information my sister gave her. She is very religious, I am not, and it has caused many fights in the past. I am not a child, I am 28 and my boyfriend is 32. Does my mother have the right to tell me how I should live my life? I am not going to do anything differently no matter what she says, I am just curious about if I have the right to be angry.

20090225101559AANlDuN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would this make my friend uncomfortable?	(2nd time posting because I want more advice/opinions)      I have had a sh*t life so far. Mother is an alcoholic, and she never talked to us when we grew up. Father died when I was 3. I was an angry kid, but rarely showed it. Family valuees didn't exist really, isolation and lonliness in it's place. I'm now 20.       Shocking thing is that in high school, I was well known and people I didn't know knew me. I showed my personality more when I was a kid than an adolescent. This beautiful girl would always pick me when we played 7up in 5th grade. Thats how I knew she liked me. We talked on the phone alot and dated in 6th grade. We broke up then and were "friends" until I dropped out of high school. I never really go to know her that well because my childhood Fuc*ed me up that bad. I don't have friend now. I'm trying to change but its hard to change everything you learned as a kid.       I still have dreams of this girl. Not sexual, but joyful. Better than any other feeling I feel when I'm awake. I realized she had such an impact on me at 11 years old because of how bad my life was VS how she made me feel, even at that age!    If there is one friend I would ever want, I would want it to be her. I saw her at our High school Thanksgiving day game that most people go to after graduating and she was happy to see me. I still couldn't communicate and it hurt alot especially that she gave me her #.      We havn't talked in over a year and I am still having dreams of her. I know I could be her friend, I jst have to be myself. I'm someone very enjoyable to be around when I am positive and comfortable which almost never happens. I respect her more than anyone i know, any family member etc. I don't know why.       I've lost my father, my childhood, myself to an undetermined extent, a mothers love and I don't want to lose what we could have as friends.       What is the best option for me? I know meeting other friends and working on myself is a 24 hr process that I am on and it's painfully difficult.       I want her in my life more than anything in the universe. Should I tell her how good of a friend she is although we didn't get to know each other that well, but are both still willing even after all these years?   I don't want to make her uncomfortable by telling her this stuff. I know the impact I made on her  wasn't as big as hers on me.      Thanks for reading I need your advice. Thank you.

Why?	back in august of 2008, i slept with someone i had a crush on for a while, someone i have talked to here and there and right after he slept with me he dated someone else for like 7 months, but broke up with her for some reason on new years. then he had a crush on this girl sarah, who rejected him and now he is treating me strange. he know's i like him deep down, but he avoids me. and when we talk we always make small talk, like "your a goof ball" or "your mama" or what ever. small stuff like that. but when he is around some of his friends he gets this ego about him. like i told my friend how i felt about him the other night, and we went to a bar and he coincidently showed up! no, seriously! it felt like it was destiny, but he was with his friends and his ego around his friends hurt me. what do i do? i am scared now.
20090227113726AAEf6kY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are young women so narrow-minded?	This is a serious question because I am 19, in college, and never had a relationship of any kind with a female before. I know I'm not ugly, but by no means am I a "model" type guy. It seems that all women in college have strict cirteria that any man has to meet before they will even look at him or acknowledge that he exists.      Yes, I have had women smile at me, but those are generally the ones that I would ignore anyway. Call me shallow like everyone else, but I believe that i deserve at the least an AVERAGE woman. Why are all other women so narrow minded and ignore me? I know I am not ugly.      Please give me advice on this!

20090227114209AA3HTA9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I give this girl something expensive?	Okay. So there is this girl I've liked for over two years now. We are both seniors in high school. She recently broke up with her boyfriend about three weeks ago. We have been hanging out a lot recently, and she knows how I feel about her.       She's really wanted this jacket for a long time... So I bought it for her, but I haven't given it to her yet because I'm having second thoughts. This is a very expensive jacket ($150).       I really like her, and I want to give her this jacket, but I don't want her to feel obligated to take it, or feel bad if she takes it, and never has the same feelings for me...      Should I give her the jacket, or just take it back?      Btw. Her birthday is soon, so I was going to give it as an early birthday present. I really like her, and chances are, things may work out with us. But is it too soon?

20090227114953AA8bEzS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she really likes me or just wants my attention?	There's this girl in my university and we had eye contact for 2 years and 4 weeks ago we started talking. I really like her and she likes me too.   but after 1 week a guy came and said he loves her and he kind of threatened me. I told her about him and told her what he said to me but she said there's nothing going on between them.So i was happy till one day that i saw her laughing and talking very warm to that guy.I asked her about him and she said it's alright and they're just friends.   this guy and she are in the same class but i am in a different class. It seems to me that she's lying to me and they're having a relationship.3 weeks ago she's kind of started ignoring me.but i had some doubt about that.So one day i offered her some E-books and she refused to get them.Another day i offered her to participate with me in the project that we have for our course. But she said she already chose her teammate.Before i talk to her, i knew that guy and she are friends.But apparently she didn't know that he loves her, and now she knows. I thought everything is over and i started not to talk to her and just said 'hello' to her and i acted very cool for about 2 weeks. But about 3 days ago i realized that she's trying to get my attention and she's trying to have a conversation with me (and she's with that guy too). What shoud i do? Should i stop ignoring her? Is she playing with me? Does she really likes me or just wants my attention? Should i wait a little more or start a relationship with her?
20090227114123AA0fNGj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need some reassurance! I know this is long, but what usually happens? Am I seeing this from too close?	My fiance is trying to see his 3 year old daughter. He has been cut out of her life since she was born for no valid reason. His ex says that he threatened to kidnap his daughter, he physically hurt her when they were together, that he never wanted to be around, and she also has been raising drama about myspace pictures and messaging.   1. He never threatened to kidnap his daughter. It isn't true, but furthermore she has no proof so it shouldn't matter.   2. He never hurt his ex. They got in a fight one day and he grabbed her arm to try to ask her to stay. He is a gentle giant and he meant no harm, but he is bigger than her so he accidentally hurt her. As soon as he realized he had hurt her he let go and apologized immediately. She took it one step further though and punched herself in the arm to make a bruise. Then she went to the school office to tell them that he did it. She says there is a record at their old school of his "abuse" but she has yet to produce one. Either way, he isn't an abuser and she is obviously immature and vengeful.   3. Obviously he wanted to be around because he sent her so many letters and emails that she threatened to get a restraining order for harassment. All the emails or letters contained only pleas to work things out and see his daughter. I read many of them so I know he's telling the truth. She also quit answering his number because he called so many times. He also stopped by the house several times with gifts for his daughter, but was never allowed to see the girl and was told his gifts were thrown away.   4. As for the myspace drama, admittedly we did take pictures of his daughter off of his ex's page and in his excitement to see what she looked like he posted them to show his friends too. Of course she got angry and so he deleted them. Other than that the only pictures that were posted were the pictures that I myself took of his daughter. (He and I broke up for a short while and for some reason his ex wanted to be my friend, so when I was taking pictures his daughter was in some of them. I never posted them until she decided she couldn't be my friend anymore and after that I didn't care about what she thought so I posted them.) The pictures are not hers, they are mine, so legally she has no rights to them. The messages are never threatening, they only have to do with him seeing his daughter and what is happening with the court proceedings and the child support agency, but she claims he is harassing her.   5. The only other thing that she might bring up is a fake profile that someone made on facebook. It had some of her old pictures but the information was all derogatory and she blamed us. Obviously we wouldn't have had access to those old pictures so we couldn't have done it, and wouldn't have anyway. But she still blames us so she might bring that up.   Basically my fiance's defense revolves around the "best interests of the child" as laid out in Ohio Custody laws whereas his ex's defense revolves around bad mouthing the father. We've been told that this case is cut and dry and she can't do anything legally, but I could use more input!
20090227115707AA4U9qa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl im interested in (her friends)?	hello. Ok so to make a story short, I was walking to lunch one day and this girl Ive seen before is coming towards me. I looked at her, she looked at me and smiles (we held eye contact it until we walked past each other).       Now I dont know if it is me but when I see her friends, they notice me and look at me, it seems like they themselves are interested (which I think is not true but maybe). It could be a coincidence or im just telling myself this. We have never met each other before so I dont know her friends would do this. Is this just me or are her friends looking at me because they want to know more about me? Thanks!

20090227115202AAOJ0rY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help! Is he a Paedophile/pervert?	Hi, I'm Jamelia, and I'm 15. I go to my local scout group in south Manchester every wednesday evening and recently my Scout master has been acting soo suspicious. We started talking about sex and relationships as part of our new enterprise and he had an erection, definatley but I thought hey, men get these regularly throuth the day and they can't always help it so I thought nothing of it. The next week however we were having a similar discusion about lesbian relationships and he had it again. So after about 5 minutes when we had a juice break I went into the store cupboard to get a basketball and when I entered he had his hand down his trousers and quickly whipped it out and shouted at me (I mean really shouted) to get out. So I went into the kitchen and about 2minutes later he came through  and apologized and said he just had things on his mind. Then he closed the door and looked me up and down and asked if I wanted to do anything for him or if he could do anything for me I said no quickly and walked out really fast I didn't know what to do, he asked my friend Abby (another girl from the same scout pack) later that evening if she wanted to do anything for him aswel!! He's never acted like this before and I've been going to scouts for over a year! Help!!    xxxxx

20090227115147AAQsLnj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Problems with an Ex Gf..Help Please?	Ok So I dated this girl for abut 11 months, everything was so perfect! like seriosuuly nothing could be more better in a relationship, well as we got farther into the relationship problems and arguing started occuring (typical in a relationship, nothings perfect). Anyways we broke up around Dec last year, and we have talked a few times since then, we even had moments where we would still hook up and say I love you and all that. Well about 2 weeks ago, she called me and said please dont call me or text me or anything and i wont call you or text you, She said I need to get over you, I dont want to love you anymore. She said she wanted to be able to let new people in her life. Well about a week went by and i got a blocked phonecall..it was her, and she apologized and said she didnt mean anything she said. Then just a few days ago she texted me out of nowhere " I want you to know I love you and miss you very much". That whole day we exchanged texts and she started saying stuff how she misses me as a bf, and the she wants things to work out again. So any ways now today just 3 days after she said all that stuff I asked her about this whole getting back together thing and she said well right now wouldnt be the best, and i wouldnt want a relationship till i graduate high school(wich would be this june) by the way she is a senior and I graduated last year. But anyways im just confused about this girl and what goes in her head. About two weeks ago I heard she really liked this guy, so maybe thats why she doesnt want a relationship because maybe shes trying to date someone else. but if thats the case why would you say stuff to your ex bf about how you miss them as a bf and love them and want things to work out. Kind of shady..Do you think shes just immature and still being in the high school scene is making her not know what she wants? Cuz im 100 percent sure there is another guy she likes in the picture, so it doesnt make any sense why she would say such things to me..like i love you and miss you as a bf..or maybe she is just trying to reassure herself that im still close and that i love her just in case it doesnt work out with the other guy, that she could just come back to me...but that would be bullshit! i wouldnt want to be just some saftey net.

20090227120127AA4T9rY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Biggest problem I've ever faced in my life. :(?	I've been dating a amazing boy for 2 1/2 years. A week ago he told me that he loved me to death and he would never ever ever leave me. He also said if he could marry me now, he would. I thought it was sweet and everything and i said that I loved him to death and nothing could seperate us. Well, three days ago, he was driving to school, and got into a major car accident. He's in a coma, and doctors say he might never come out. Im miserable, and almost on the rank of suicidal. What should i do? Should I move on!? I am so confused. There's nothing I can do.
20090227114446AAbVRBb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am only 17 years old.?	I will eighteen next month. I have known my boyfriend for about 2 years now. No matter how much his personal life changed, or mine, our relationship together has never altered. We finally started to make things offical about 3 months ago, im glad we took the steps to take our friendship to the next level. We have talked about our future together and even possibly marriage. He left almost 2 weeks ago for Navy bootcamp and will be gone for about 6 years, with school and things. If we are still together after his schooling, which is in about 2 years. Do you think i am too young to get married and move with him on or around a base? Or am i too young to be making such a "big" decision? What do you think?

My bf wants him out too, but he doesnt want a fight. His father HAS lifted a hand to me when I told him I like Pink Floyd (no reason to hit a person, I don't think) and he treats my daughter like crap. As I said, he has no income and barely lifts a finger and YES, my bf DOES want him out also.

I'm not real skinny, and I'm not too fat. I'm pretty much average. lol. I think one of the main reasons i don't have a boyfriend is that I'm homeschooled, so I don't meet many guys. So, I was wondering, how do you get guys to notice you? I dont have anyone specific in mind, but I would like guys to talk to me. Right now i'm pretty much invisible... I have friends that are constantly surrounded by guys, and so I want to know, guys, what makes you notice a girl? What qualites do you like in a girl?

When i confront him of it, and argue with him about it, he says he was either not thinking, or he was just lying, or he was embarrassed to tell his friends the truth. I also found out, to add on to every thing else, that he is planing to dump me by the end of the year. I argued about it with him. He said the same thing.

20090227114121AApKWD7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I give her another chance?	We first got together at the age of 15. Over the course of 3 years she cheated on me about 5-10 times. The entire relationship was long distance (at least 3 hours away) besides the first 6 months. We'd see each other about twice a month. We DID say we loved each other and I feel we both meant it. Fed up with her cheating at age 18 I broke up with her. Now, 2 years later, at age 20, she has suddenly came back into my life (after a very physically abusive relationship with her ex) and says she is certain I am the one she wants to marry someday and she displayed a convincing apology and reformation, stating that she was young and stupid and that she promises it will never happen again. She says she is mature now and she is 100% sure that i can trust her. I know she loves me and i know i love her and i've never seen her so emotional about this trust issue. I really believe she has changed...it was a long time ago but i need second opinions. Everything else in our relationship is absolutely perfect and it has been from the start, of course besides this cheating issue. What do you guys think?

There is this guy I have been dating for a little over a month,we aren't official yet, but every Thursday he picks me up and I stay with him from til Sunday. When we aren't together he calls or I call him every night; up until this past Wednesday. He hasn't called me and when I called him he hasn't answered. Which is bizarre because he constantly is telling me how much he misses me and how he can't wait to see me again. I don't know if this is just his way of telling me he isn't interested anymore, or maybe something serious happened and he is unable to answer his phone. I need advice!

I feel in love with her at first sight. She was going through traumatic situations of her life when i entered her life. She felt happy and it changed her world. She says that I was like an angel in her life. I love her from the bottom of my heart. She loves me too. She is short-tempered but I understand it and don;t feel bad as I love her so much. We made love as well. But many a times she unintentionally says something related to her past and I am not sure if she comes to know but it hurts me so much. And when we make love, as soon as she has her orgasm she just want to stop it. Many a times I wanna continue but she does not and it leaves me sad and unhappy. I do not understand this behavior at all. Then she says she did not intend to do that and she loves me. We are planning to get married but I am scared..I dunno what shd i do...she shows that she cares but not that much. I never had a relationship and she is the first girl in my life. I have so many dreams about my married-life but I dont know if she has dreams or not or if her dreams are fulfilled in her previous relationship. please advice.

20090227113819AA0Dd41	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Something is very wrong with my fiance. How do I get her to talk?	The other night my fiance had a nightmare that was quite disturbing. She jolted upright and started hyperventilating. I turned on the lamp and noticed she was pale white trembling and sweating. I kept asking her what had happened but she didn't answer at first. Then she started crying, no more like sobbing. I held her to comfort her but it wouldn't stop. She couldn't talk she just cried. It seemed to come in waves and sometimes I could slightly calm her by rubbing her back, but it didn't stop til almost 6 in the morning. I think she finally cried herself to sleep. I stayed with her the rest of the day as I was afraid to leave her alone, and she certainly was not gonna be able to go to work. She slept for 11 hours. When she woke up she tried to act like she was ok but I could tell she was still upset. Something is very wrong, but she won't talk about it to anyone (I took her to the doctor but she is resistant to talking about what happened). What can I do to help her? What would cause her to be so scared?
20090227114027AAXhQab	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my best friend want to be more than just friends?	I met my best friend a couple of years ago because we are on the same course at University.  Ever since day one we have got on like a house on fire, she's beautiful and I'm not a bad looking guy.      To give some background on the situation, we have never kissed or anything like that but there are certain things that make me think she might want to be more than my friend.      We have been on holiday together 3 times.      The first time it was with two of my guy pals and me, I shared a room with her but separate beds.      The second time was again with two of my guy pals, she booked the hotel room and claimed that she had booked a twin room but when we got there it was a double bed. When I offered to sleep on the floor, she insisted I share the bed, but again nothing happened.      The third time it was just me and her and again we shared a bed but nothing happened.      When one of our friends asked her if we were seeing each other, her reply was "if anything was going to happen between us, it would have happened when we were alone on holiday the first time when we shared a room."      Other stuff that confuses me is that for instance on her birthday when guys were wishing her happy birthday she gave them a friendly kiss on the cheek, but when it came to me she got kind of shy and didn't kiss me. (I was the only one that this happened to.)      We text each other and phone each other a lot and when her gran died, I was the only person she phoned.      We go out to dinner and out to the cinema alot to, as well as other stuff like shoping.  I'm starting to feel like I do all the things a boyfriend does, so now I'm starting to think maybe we should go out.      I'm a totaly gentleman to her, I walk her to her bus and wait with her for it to arrive, likewise with taxis etc.      Just wondering what people think if whether she wants more or not?      Thanks for any replies in advance.

20090227114041AAT8rjS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I call the number or ask him about it again?	So last weekend I was just messing around with my boyfriend by acting like going through his phone when I found some text msgs from where he used to live. I asked him who it was and he said it was his cousin. Well I don't believe him I think its his ex of 4 years.he talked to her 1 other time that I know of and he told me that he told her that  was pregnant and he loved me and she started crying saying that she wants to be back with him and that if he wants to move back he's always got a place to stay that was when we started seeing eachother then when he moved in with me I heard she was calling his moms house everyday looking for him trying to get his number. Which is bullshit and y I don't like her. Y should I? Anyways I looked up the number online and its close to where his ex is from.well idk the area to well but good enough to see its not his cousin so should I call the number and find out who it is or ask him about it again?

BUT I'm also starting to get the feeling that I should stay away from him because of what he does with me. (and not to mention, about every other pretty girl he knows)   He treats me kind of bad sometimes and ignores me so the other day I ignored him. I was walking right past him when all of a sudden he grabbed me and like, had me in a headlock and somehow my face ended up on his crotch and his friend started messing with this book I had. So I was like "Let go. I have to get to class!" And he was like "Don't leave." And it was just like playing around but then all of a sudden HE BIT MY ARM. Does anyone else find this weird or does he just really like me? So I finally got out of the headlock and I was like "You bit me!" And he was like "ha yeah. I don't know why I did. But you taste good."  Like WTF?? So  I know I should probably stay away from him I just want to know what people think about it.

20090227124829AAvZ2vd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I ran into an x-girlfriend?	I asked out a girl from the fish counter about 6 months ago. She was always basically giving me the cold shoulder. I'd call her and always get her voice mail. When I texted her she would only talk for a bit and thats it. She always said things like oh my car isn't working. So I tired to see if she wanted to do things at places near her work before or after. Nothing ever happened. So I told her I'm all set. She got upset and started talking. Then it was back to the same old. I left a voice mail and said "since I've gotten to talk to you basically more at your work then I have in the past month I'm all set. I have more options. Nice meeting you, goodbye. "         I was at a grocery store and ran in to get some juice and a lottery ticket. I went to the customer service counter because it was going to be quicker. I didn't have cash to buy the lottery ticket so I just bought the juice. I didn't realize it was her until I got to the car but she was complementing me on my jacket. She said that it was very swave looking jacket. It seemed to feel like she recognized me when I came up. I didn't acknowledge her or anything.       I just want another person's pov on this. Mainly a woman's so guys skip this question. Tank youse.
20090227122335AAzSusW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is he thinking? Help me please decode this lol.?	Okay so there is this guy i like. He is kind of the total opposite of me. Im a small, shy-ish, quiet, geeky girl. He is a loud, tall, gangsta guy. He's also a year older then me. He's in 11th im in 10th.      But last year we were in the same computer class. And we became pretty good friends. We both loved the same sports team. And talked a lot.      But i never really thought of him like that last year. But this year we have no classes. But every time i see him he always looks at me. Never says anything just looks. Not like a admiration glare either or angry. Just looks over casually.       And once it was just me and him and this other kid in the hall. He knew the other kid and the other kid was right next to me and he like fist pumped him and almost whacked me in the face, he said sorry of course. Idk why that was important but yeah LOL.      Is it possible for him to like me? Or what is he thinking?

20090227125813AAPtZ0S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	It doesn't really feel like we're going out....???? Help!?	I've been going out with this guy for about 2 weeks. I really like him and I know he really likes me, but, it's kind of weird. We're in the same class but we NEVER speak to each other in class. It's like we only speak together at lunch. Sometimes I see him in the mornings, but, even then it's only a small "hi". The other day he sat beside me in one of our classes and only said "hi", then he ignored me for the rest of the time. It's as if we're not going out. And, he ALWAYS talks to this girl in class. They're ex's but I know that they're just very good friends, but, still. Shouldn't he atleast talk a BIT to his gilfriend? I mean, let's say he comes arrives late at school and when he comes into the class and passes my desk, he doesn't even acknowledge me.    I'm afraid to tell him anything because I'm really shy and scared that he'll think I'm like pressuring him into talking to me.   We're also from different groups of friends. He's popular, which I'm not.    Any advice??? Thanks!

He listen well when we meet and he ask questions. He laughed at my jokes and flirted by squeezing his eyes.      but I'm doubting coz he seldom calls, we don't have any contacts between dates. he don't look into my eyes when he's talking. he never touches me. he sometimes makes open plans.      I'm sure he likes me but I don't know whether he's shy or there's simply not that much chemistry? thanks.

This question will make more sense if you read this:   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       So, it is a week later, and I went back to the bank to see if this girl got the flowers, and to ask this girl out.  She wasn't there, apparently she was on lunch.  So I just said please tell (this girl) that I said hi, and I left.      Right now I am nervous I came off as creepy or a stalker, since I really don't know the girl very well.  In the past we didn't really talk much--I wanted to send flowers to say hi, and do something sweet... but I'm afraid that I might have creeped out the whole bank, and am considering not going back to there ever because I am so embarrassed.      Is there hope for me?  Should I go back to the bank, or even ask this girl out?  Or did I screw myself by sending flowers, not really getting to know the girl first??

I went out with this girl but she just wanted to be friends since she wasn't ready for any relationship. The friend who introduced me to her tells me that I should call her up again (it's been 3 months). The friend tells me that time changes things and that she might've changed her mind. We really did have a great time on our first date and we really connected but she had no intention of it going anywhere beyond a friendship.

20090227122453AA5a2Au	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do we resolve this and all stay friends?	on tuesday a local pub held a girls only charity night centred round an Ann Summers party and some male strippers. I went with a group from work including the gf of my partners best m8 and we all had a good time and raised money. The evening finished with the strippers and once they had got their kit off they went round the room and for a ￡1 donation to the Breast Cancer charity you got a small blob of baby oil and five seconds to rub it anywhere on their body. This was a good laugh and practically every girl used the opportunity to rub it on their penis. When I got home I told my bf who laughed and said it was a good cause but his mate went mad when his gf told him and said we were all sl*ts etc and this has put all of under a strain as my bf supports me but does not want to fall out with his best m8 etc

20090227125048AA6KVEb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I keep getting annoyed at my boyfriend all the time?	My boyfriend and I have been together for around 6 months now however have been best friends for the best part of 3 years.  At the beginning things were great however after a few months I started to become depressed due to family issues.      Whilst I took a few weeks recovery time off, I heard my boyfriend had been trying to get in my best friend and had become obsessed with her.  He also went on to me about her constantly when he got home from school about all the fun they had had together, whilst I was sitting at home, crying my eyes out.      After that, I never looked at him the same way and things got worse.  When we fell out, he would make hate lists about me and basically make me like rubbish.      I would never in a million years thought of falling out with him or insulting him.  However, it seems as though no matter how large or little he annoys me, I seem to rage at him now.  I can't help it, honestly, I've tried. And it's weird, because I don't feel bad.  Whenver we fall out and he is crying, I am no longer bothered.      Is this because he has hurt me? I am not like this, this isn't me =[ it's so hurtful and I don't know what to do.  Does it show I have gone off him?  Help, please =[

20090227121405AAUhNpx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Quick! How do I do some damage control here!?	My boyfriend dumped me recently and I told one of my good friends about how he did it a week after we had sex for the first time. I told her that I felt pressured into it by him, which I was, and that I regret it a lot. Well, turns out she told one of her friends, who told another and it just spread. He also dumped me on the same day that his ex(and best friend) broke up with her boyfriend. And I did tell several people that I thought that the timing with that was suspicious. It was wrong, it was gossipy, and I regret it. I was just really hurt and wasn't thinking when I told certain people that. It got back to my ex and now he's furious with me. He thinks I'm trying to ruin his reputation.       But here's the worst part: him and I are co-workers. And the rumors spread all the way back to our job. I know for a fact that two of my co-workers know about it and I'm so embarrassed. That's so personal and now everyone knows about it. I tried explaining myself to him and how it is out of my control, but it seems like the damage is done. I don't care that he is angry at me, but I care that everyone at my job knows and that he now hates me. It's made this already painful situation a hell of a lot worse.      We go to the same school also. I seriously want to crawl under a rock right now and never get out.       So.. How do I handle this mess!? Should I quit my job(it's only a part-time job since I'm still in high school)?

About 2 months ago all this started. He said he was going to a party for one of his friends at a bar. I couldn't go because I am only 19 and he is 24. So... I can't go to bars anyway. Well later he came back and was excited to talk to me about it. He told me all about the fun he had and how he was dancing with this one girl, that I don't even know. I was upset but didn't say much. And he insisted they were just dancing. Well then he starts watching porn more, going to the hot chick coffee places where the girls are in there underwear, and he whistles at girls when he's in the car with me right next to him. He's always talking about sexy girls on tv and tells me I don't have to worry because they wouldn't want him anyway. But it still makes me feel like I'm not important.

Well.. theres this guy.. isnt there always.. he does go to my school so i see him constantly.. ages ago we started chatting casually on msn and he started flirting and stuff.. one day he just randomly put his cam on and wanked himself.. id always liked him and after this i thought that maybe he liked me too but before i could ask him anything else he signed off.. months past and i ended up getting quite friendly with one of his friends.. we did get pretty close.. we ended up going out but it was constantly on and off and so eventually i called it quits but i did alot of stupid things that the guy i liked originally got to hear about through rumours.. after this i got chatting to him again on msn and a few days later he did the same thing again.. hes got me really confused.. he helps me with my homework sometimes cause hes the year above and i really like him.. i talked to his friends about it and they said i was to just give up because hes never had a girlfriend and they all say he doesnt want one.. the boy hasnt ever even kissed a girl.. when i told my friend about it she said he did it to her too but i dont know if i believe her if you get me as shes pretty jealous.. hes an amazing guy but hes so shy around me whenever im near him which isnt really that often as hes usually around my ex.. advice would be great...

20090227120727AA1DK52	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it really possible for a guy to change this much?	I'm the real jealous type and I've been asking my fiancee real personal things like did he ever watch porn, what kinds, does he get video games with sexual content in it for that and so on...I'm his first girlfriend and we're real happy together as long as that's not brought up because he says that it was all in the past and that he was depressed and lonely and didn't really care but he says now that he's found me, he's stopped all of that because he holds himself to high standards. I also had a porn addcition but he doesn't dwell on it like I do, even though I'm still recovering [somestimes I still watch even though it's not anywhere near as much as I used to].       I also asked him did he ever look/ stare at other women and he told me he did not, I bugged him further and he admitted that he checks his surroundings and he can notice beauty in the way that he can tell who is ugly and who is not and he may look at a girl twice just to see if that's really what he saw. He's nowhere near gay and he says that he notices beauty in guys too, like who the girls would be attracted to.      I don't know if I should trust him, what if he starts to like them better because they look better or something? But I can kind o fsee where he is comming from, because I can tell who is good looking and not and sometimes I look twice but they never affect me.      Please give me some good advie!!

20090227124731AAykxXY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I go for one of my best guy friends or not?	I have a guy friend who is here on foreign exchange from Germany. We've gotten really close lately and he's constantly introducing me as/telling me I'm his best friend here. He had a girlfriend back home when he came, and I had a boyfriend (who I just recently broke up with) but we'd still flirt, and it was always as a joke.      However, now we're both single, and we're hanging out a lot, doing things together, etc. My feelings for him have definitely changed, and I just realized he's leaving in five months. I don't want him to be overseas without ever really letting him know how I felt. I also don't want to get in a serious relationship with him, which would hurt both of us once he left.      It's frustrating because I can't tell if he likes me or not and one time he said he had a crush on me, but again, I don't know if he was joking or not.      Is it even worth going after, or will I just ruin one of the most unique friendships I've ever had?

There's just one little thing:  She told me that she's still sad about this and that she still kinda loves him.  She did say that she's not gonna go back to him.  So far, I let her know that she can call me anytime to talk about her feelings and to ask for my advice.      Other than that, I need to know what else to do.  I've been madly in love with her since November 2008 (I'm 18, and she's 20, and we're both Mexican).  How should I show her that I can be a potential boyfriend?  How long should I wait till I confess my feelings to her and/or ask her out on a date?  What can I do to make sure that she won't date another dude?  What other advise can you give me?      I love her so much, and it would be the greatest thing in the Universe if she were to become my very first girlfriend!  Yay!      VIVA LA RAZA!

I have a crush on a popular guy....and it's not that I'm not popular....I'm jsut one of those girls who is nice to everybody, shy, large group of friends but, not really noticed outside of my group. He, on the other hand is also quiet, really cute, and popular. He is one year older than me, but he's in one of my classes. The thing is that we have to do skits and everything and I feel uncomfortable getting up in front of him because I know he'll never like me and I'm always nervous because I know he's looking at me (since I'm the only one up there)      I always feel like there's something wrong with me or ugh I look ugly today...which causes me to mess up even more.      Anyways my question is how can I get over this crush, because I know he will never like me anyways, so there's no point feeling awkward in front of him, or day dreaming about him.

20090227131410AA783Tu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS! [and girls too i guess] please help!?	Okay, so there's this guy I like. Tell me if you think he likes me back.      He was in a grade above me, but he was held back. He's the class clown type, but doesn't associate with the "popular" crowd. He's in my science class, but doesn't sit near me there, so we don't talk. In health, he sits next to me (assigned seats) and he always puts his feet near mine and leans like really close to me. We talk in that class. After health, we have technology together. There are long tables with chairs, but we have a big class so we each sit on a rolly office chair at the end of 2 different tables. Fortunately, the tables are only about a foot away from each other. Anyways, he sits like at the table in front of me so he always like rolls me backwards and stuff. My friends think he's flirting with me. He always helps me and he asks me to help him, even when it appears he understands. Today in technology, he was talking to me then he goes "Wow my hands are really soft. Feel them." So I sorta softly felt his hand, and pulled my hand away. He then said "No do it again, you couldn't feel it." Also today, I asked him for gum and he gave some to me. Then some other girl came up and asked and he was like "I don't have anymore, sorry" and he really did. He smiles at me all the time and looks at me when I'm not even saying anything.      What do you think?   Please help!   xoxo      P.S. We're both 14 years old.

20090227150512AAR9rVi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a guy that likes me, suddenly stop talking to me?	This has happened quite a bit before. He'll start talking to me alot, flirting with me, hinting that he "wants a girlfriend," etc. but then he'll suddenly just stop talking to me, texting me, flirting, and even looking at me. When we walk past eachother we're both pretty awkward, yet I catch him looking at me from far away every once in a while. I figure if he wanted nothing to do with me then he wouldn't look at me at all, right? Why would he stop doing this? I know he might be shy, but take my word for it, he is probably the most outgoing and rebellious guy I know, and he talks to practically every other girl in the school. Does he maybe think that I don't like him? I've told him I liked him before, after he told me he liked me like, 10 times, haha.

I'm on a kind of dating hiatus at the moment, just taking some time to find my self and whatnot. I keep getting offers to go out though and each offer seems to be more tempting than the last.

20090227143903AArlRS2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whats your normal reaction when you have a crush on somebody?	Im talking somebody you seriously want to date or wouldn't mind to anyway. You step on the gas, or just go in cruise control? You start playing games, or just put it all out there? You play the shifting game, slow down speed up or are you on full throttle? Lets here how you usually play it when you are having a crush on somebody? I guess if you are married and have a long time boyfriend or girlfriend you might not count. But you can still give advice anyway.
20090227144424AA8YVva	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i cope with a guy who leads me on,but keeps on getting back with his ex?

20090227142631AAVOuLI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, would you like this?	So this guy that goes to school with me is pretty much everything i look for in a guy. He is also on the shy side when it comes to talking to a girl he likes, he asked one of his friends for my number and i was cool with it cause i like him too. My phone cannot recieve text messages from non-verizon customers for some odd reason, so i have no idea if he texted me or not.  It`s pretty hard to approach him in the hallway since his locker at the other end of the hallway. This is a guy that i do not want to lose. Me and my friend were talking about having me write him a note, putting it in an envelope and taping it to his truck window and so when he gets back from his away basketball game tonight, he will go to his truck at the school parking lot and find that envelope. Guys would you like this or not? thanks. :)
20090227145234AAwqb2e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are some people just meant to be alone?	Do you think maybe somehow there's a way I can find happiness all by myself? I've been out with people never anything serious, but every single time got hurt. I've seen what broken relationships can do to people as well. Thing is I'm weird in the way I've had a bad past, but I'm can't honestly see anyone getting past that to see the goodness in me. So if I'm stuck this way, how do I deal with it?

20090227132505AA72Ud5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WHAT DO I DOOO!???!?! please read!?	Ok here's my story:   I met this guy and we've been going out for 4 mo. now and we are really serious about each other. We love each other to DEATH and we always were really close. His mother is psycho, and I donno what to do! I'll explain: There is a lot of people who think she's a ***** and a liar. She won't let him see me or talk to me on the phone because she thinks he's "too emotionally involved" with me, even though he's 14. She barely ever lets him use the computer even for homework; because of 1 time that he looked at boobs on the internet when he was 10. Just a little over 2 weeks ago, he asked her if he could see me more, and they got in a big fight and he smacked her because she was b!tching at him so bad. His dad was home, and he had to hold my bf so he didn't attack his mom, but she freakin called the COPS on him! he's 14 and the dad was RIGHT there! When she ran out of the room while the dad was holding him down, she said "All of this because of that little *****!!" about me. UGH I HATE her! She even talked to my mom on the phone and lied saying she has bruises all over, and that he almost killed her, and that she did NOT call me a *****, but my bf would NEVER lie to me! Everyone my mom has told about his mom says she's freakin insane and an awful mother for calling the cops on her kid. His mom is also a control freak, and he just had his golden birthday and she got him an ipod, but wont give it to him until he "deserves it" HOW MEAN???!!!?!?!?!?!??!?!  Well that will be 3 weeks tomorrow. What do I do about this whole relationship? I feel depressed alot because of his mom and what she has done to us. Should I stay with him even though we wont see or talk this summer or next year because I'll be in 8th and he'll be in 9th? or do I end it? please think carefully!!! THANKS!

" ((I KNOW THIS I GETTING LONG BUT BEAR WITH ME)) later he asked me why i text him and i told him that i dont like to divide my church friends from my school friends and im trying to close that gap. and he said something like oh or got it. then i told him that it helpes that he is kinda cute. and he said "oh, well thank you, as are you darling." and i said thank you dearest" keeping up with the nick name thing.       ***HERES THE IMPORTANT PART***      im going to go hang out with friends tonight and he will be there but i dont know how to act. stupid right? i mean should i act like we didnt agree on an attraction between us. or what.  were going to watch a movie (a funny one) should i sit next to him or what. funny movies are obviosly not hand holding kinda stuff.       i feel like a flippin 13 year old talking  about this. but i dont have much experience with guys.

20090227132819AAHWUDb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Met this female accountant....?	There is this female accountant who works at a bank. I usually go to the bank to deposit/withdraw money.... not to meet her. However, her body language perplexes me. So I am interested in learning more. Upon meeting her the first day, we had a normal conversation. Nothing too interesting. The second time I went back, there was eye contact established, she glanced a few times at me while I was waiting in line. But the third time I went back, all of a sudden, she's happy to see me. She waved hello an smiled a lot. So we talked a bit.... about the day and how things were going.       Afterwards, it was, "Goodbye, see ya later." And she was smiling back. It was like she was so excited on the third day I met her even though I go twice a month to the bank.       Thoughts?

There are a few women I meet at work and outside of work. Almost always, these same women would maintain eye contact, smile, and then….. as I walk pass them, they move their eyes down to my chest and down below.. and then look away while still smiling.       Thoughts?
20090227143920AAjTIlW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I asking for too much?	So I've been going out with this guy for a month before Valentine's day. He was calling me everyday, a couple of times a day, telling his friends and family about me, without even knowing me that well. Anyway, we made plans a couple of days before Valentine's day to go out and do something. The day before he called me and said that he might not be able to see me on Valentine's day. I was upset, but didn't say anything.  So he called me on Valentine's day morning saying happy you know..blah blah.. and said that hes not doing anything on Valentine's day, and hes also not going to see me. I got pissed off and cursed him out. Now he called me a couple of times that day, I didn't pick up. I see it like if you really wanted to see me you would of. So I cursed him out and hung up. I don't pick up on his calls, and all my friends are like you're asking for too much. I really liked this guy, but he played me, so I peaced him lol. Is there something wrong with that?

I'm not that open with guys, in an intimate way, since I've been hurt so much before. I'm not in many relationships because of it and when I am, I treat them right and I really do give them everything that I have. I think this guy sees my tough outer shell and I want him to see the side that likes him I just don't know how to show him. How can I do this? And I have a feeling he likes me a little too.

20090227131614AABqrkw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend confusions... Help!!!! :S?	I've been going out with this guy for about 2 weeks. I really like him and I know he really likes me, but, it's kind of weird. We're in the same class but we NEVER speak to each other in class. It's like we only speak together at lunch. Sometimes I see him in the mornings, but, even then it's only a small "hi". The other day he sat beside me in one of our classes and only said "hi", then he ignored me for the rest of the time. It's as if we're not going out. And, he ALWAYS talks to this girl in class. They're ex's but I know that they're just very good friends, but, still. Shouldn't he atleast talk a BIT to his gilfriend? I mean, let's say he comes arrives late at school and when he comes into the class and passes my desk, he doesn't even acknowledge me.    I'm afraid to tell him anything because I'm really shy and scared that he'll think I'm like pressuring him into talking to me.   We're also from different groups of friends. He's popular, which I'm not.    Any advice??? Thanks!

I've gone through many relationships though, where if they didn't get what they wanted after 3 or 4 months, they're gone. Why do men do this when they claim to be really into you? I've always felt that any guy who liked you enough would be prepared to wait. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned.....

20090227140041AAWQJ7v	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it fair to go out with a guy that your friend likes?	I have had a crush on this guy for a little while, and his best friend told me that he is going to ask me out soon. I told some of my friends and then one of them (named Kelsey) got really mad. Apparently, she also had a crush on him, but she never told anyone. She said it's not fair if I go out with him, and if I do, she won't be my friend anymore. I really like this guy, and Kelsey isn't exactly my best friend. Actually, she's always selfish and never cares about anyone else, so she's not even close to a good friend. Don't I have the right to go out with him because we both like each other? I know it's hard for her because she also liked him, but do you think she should be a little less selfish about it?

20090227145808AAzDN4H	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get over a girl?	I'm a 17 year old guy and i fell in love with this girl 3 years ago. We became best friends and I've been completely in love with her for the last 3 years. I fell in love with her the second I saw her. We've had classes together for the last 3 years and i thought she started to like me. She kept telling me that I was smart and being really flirty. Then she started to hug me all the time and she kept telling her parents about me. I kept having these strong urges to kiss her. I would get weak at the knees when I was around her and get butterflies in my stomach and I would get really nervous around her. I was so in love with her that I wanted to marry her. She was the only thing I could think about. I kept daydreaming about her all day. The thing was I just couldn't ask her out. Every time i would try to ask her, I would freeze up and i tried to ask her out for 3 years. I tried everything and couldn't get the words out. I even bought her a ring for Valentine's Day but I was too scared to give it to her.      She just got a boyfriend and i'm just completely heartbroken. I feel completely devastated and sad. She's the only thing I can think about. I'm trying to get over her but I just can't stop thinking about her. It hurts so much. I know I have to get over her but I just can't. I can't even sleep anymore and its driving me crazy. i can't get over her. Everything I did was for her. I started boxing and going to the gym so I would look better for her. It's so agonizing when she kisses her boyfriend in front of me. She was the only part of my life that truly made me happy. She was so good at comforting me when I was down and I feel like I really need her now b/c i always feel sad. Seeing her was the only thing I actually looked forward to everyday. The only reason i wanted to go to school was so I could see her. It's just so hard to even be around her. I still have that strong urge to kiss her and I really have to restrain myself from doing it and its really hard to do. Whats even worse is that she sits next to me in math class and I have to see her everyday. Every night when I go to bed, I always dream about kissing her or marrying her and then when I wake up I realize that it was just a dream and I feel even worse. I feel terrible all the time. I can't sleep and i haven't been doing as well at boxing. I feel like I can never love another girl the same way. I feel so empty and incomplete inside without her. I don't know what I did to deserve this torture. I just need some help getting over her. Can you help me out here?
20090227142004AAdIEyb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I put myself out there and she threw me off track..?	Me and my girlfriend broke up but are friends, and i want to get back together with her (i didn't even want to break up in the first place it was so stupid) and she's thinking about it. Anyway we was talking on msn today and it was fine, we was joking around and all that.      Then i said 'speak to you later. bye. x' and she said 'bye.'      Now i know it sounds stupid but that's a big sign coming from her, why won't she just be friendly back i don't f*cking get it.      I might've made her uncomfortable when i think about it actually but it wasn't personal uncomfortable it was about me liking it when i spent time with her because i said something the other day and she might've gotten the wrong idea. Not anything bad.      Anyway so i did that feeling, sounds stupid but, vulnerable i guess and she just does that to me. :\      What does it even mean? i think i've got a rough idea though :(   And shall i just drop this?   And she won't start speaking to me it's usually me saying 'hi' whenever we speak, i initiate it all but she still speaks when i start it.   Shall i wait for her to start talking to me next time? but she'll probably have a strop if we don't talk in a bit :\   And shall i just give up on her?      (the thing is there's no other girl im interested in at the moment so i'm kind of hoping on this one :\ i'm not being a lapdog though).

Basically,my friends are I are going to a disco      I work every Friday night until 10 o clock and haven't been out since Christmas, I haven't really felt in the partying mood      I didn't feel like going out whenever my friend's did because I was tired after work and stuff,and my friends are fine with this,apart from one called Lisa who is convinced I'm a recluese and tells me to 'just f*king come out'         So we're going out next Friday      Im not really crazy about going, but I knew Lisa was going to give me a hard time agani so I just decided that I'd go      Lisa said to go to her house to get ready, I'm not finished til 10 o clock as usual but I said I'd go to her house after work, no problem         But now she has said that she's decided that her and my other friends are leaving her house fot the disco and 10:30,even though it doesn't start till 12?!, and said that I'll have to get ready by myself and meet them there         I REALLY don't want to do that,as I've never been to the disco before and I don't want to be seen walking in on my own!      I can't tell Lisa this,as she will sigh loudly and complain about having to rearrange her plans      One of my friends could come to my house at 10 to get ready,but I don't want to do that as I know that they want to go to Lisa's house         I have to go,as Lisa will give me a hard time about it,but I reallllly don't want to go on my own...what should I do?         =(

20090227140744AAYVB5m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do attractive women ever go years without being intimate or being in a relationship?	As a guy I could easily go a couple years without being intimate with no problem. The same for my friends, of course they enjoy sex just as much as the next person, but for a lot of men it is not nearly as common as it is for women. So do attractive women ever go a really long time without being intimate with someone? Or are most good looking women used to being intimate on a constant basis?

20090227141341AArrHws	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies i need some help with a girl. Very confused.?	Ok, this is gunna be in fragments at first. Me and her best friends for three years, couple this past year. Mid summer, her parents found out we fooled around, i then turned 18 and they used that to split us up. Since mid summer, to december we had no speaking. Then beginning of January, we started talking again. Only through AIM      I realized that theres no chance of us bein together, and she had been mean to me so i decided to stop the talking and not do anything till she turns 18 in may. So last week, i asked to talk one more time because i needed to move on with college and my life till she was more independent with her parents. After, she was just angry and hurtful. I wont go into detail, but stuff that would hurt your feelings.      So the last thing i said was, thanks for being an imature baby the last time we talk and have fun ebin fat ugly and alone. I know i know it was stupid, i was angry at her. But she blocked me right after and i really thought that was it. So a week later, i come home tonight from class, and i'm unblocked.      When i asked why she did, she just gave me the answer, " When i unplug my computer you get unblocked for some reason. " That sounded a little weird to me. I then told her that if she doesnt want me around or doesnt see how perfect i am for her then to just block me.       Then i said that your basing your feelings for off of not seeing me in over 8 months and she said nothing after. I was getting frustrated so finally i just said please just block me if you dont care about me and wanna loose a really special one in a million guy. I"m not bragging but for her, i'm the perfect guy. No disrespect. But even after i called her on it and all that she still say nothing nor did she block me.       Whats up?

20090227143659AA7kDOd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Cute birthday gift or not?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 months and we'd been close friends for about a year before that. He is my best friend, and for his birthday I want to give him something unique that I know he'll like.   We're both (enthusiastic!) members of our school's marching band and we play the same instrument, the trumpet, so for one of his gifts I was thinking of using the WalMart photo customization to make him a marching band tee shirt! They're inexpensive (about $10) and I've already designed it (I'm very computer savvy, and so is he.) My question is, do you think he'll think it is a dumb gift or a cute one? Actually, he'll probably like it just because it's from me, but I'm wondering if he'll love it. Also, if anyone knows whether the WalMart photo-printed shirts are good quality, because that would be very helpful also!   Thank you so much for reading, and I hope you can help! (:

I never kissed a  girl and I'm also a virgin. I really want to be intimate with someone so I plan on using an adult sex finder website. Most people lose their virginity to someone they love but no one ever asked me out and any girl that I wanted to get to know wasn't interested. I didn't have high expectations like only looking for the hottest girls. I looked for any attractive girl, and attractive isn't the same as being hot. If I lost my virginity to a random girl and had numerous one night stands, would that hurt my chances at having future relationships for true love?

And just a couple sentences more we talked. But I always find that she is looking my way I sit right next to her but it seems as if she is looking out the door as if she heard something I dont know..       Does she like me? And I find I always have to start the convos on aim, is she shy or what? Im confused         The few things iv said to her in person I felt PERFECT.. Like some other girls i talk to I tend to blush and what not..      And What do I talk about, Hellp! I have no idea what to say! I really like her! I dont want to mess it up!      Today I was in class and she kept looking at me, I could see her looking at me at the corner of my eye and when I go to look at her she turns her head.. She did it all day today in both class's         And Since I sit literally right next to her and the door is all the way on the other side (to the right) I dont know.. and in my other class i sit diagnoally behind her.. She like turns her body my way and looks and then I see her in the corner of my eye and then she turns away         On aim sometimes we really get into it, but most of the time she just gives me shitty answers... Is she doing this on purpose.. Wtf is going on..

Hi, I'm 13, grade 7 and there's this girl I really like, she is pretty, she's not like those girls that are like paris hilton and stuff, she's like the perfect girl for me but I have trouble aproching her cause I don't want to be like a fag or like an *** infront of her so I get shy cause I don't want her to think I'm a wierdo and stuff. I just got to know her the begining of the school year and stuff, I know alot about her so it's hard for me to talk to her or just small talk since I don't know what to say and stuff. And if I become to flirty with her, it'll be kinda awkward if she doesn't like me since she'll prob tell other people and it'll be like a huge rumor and you know grade 7's we're almost all imature about love, well not me but yea. She likes me like a friend I guess but I can't find a way to become more than a friend like best friends or even in a relationship and stuff, when Im with her I get shy and freeze up and don't know waht to say. But like on msn I can talk to her for a long time since I'm not infront of her and stuff and if I say something I can always say jokes or like my friend wrote that ;P .Can someone tell me how to aproach a girl you like without being like shy and stuff. And ideas for small talk or something.   Please help!! A.S.A.P.
20090227132559AAr1m9e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this mean....???? and does he like me and i him? my best guy friend said this?	ok so i've been friends with this guy since 5th grade and lately he has been like asking me weird questions like "do u want to make out" and things like that. i had one dream about us making out and now this. he has a girlfriend who we both meet in 6th grade. he tells when we text for hours, that he does want to make out with me and if he and his gf now ever break up if i want to go out with him. i would try and go out with him. he is not ugly but not really hot. he told him that his gf may break up with him soon. why idk. he asked me if me and he were going out if he can put his hands up my shirt. and if i got a bf and he breakup with his gf would i make it worth the wait for him to say single and wait for me.      does he really like or just kidding?   my other friends think he likes me i think so too. that's ok cause i kind of like him.      by the way i don't know if this helps we're both 15 and in 9th grade

20090227142055AA139e2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Id like my boyfriend to sleep over my house..?	I guess you could say that my parents are fairly strict when it comes to me and my boyfriend, im fifteen and he's just turned sixteen (although they do like him). Anyway, my brother's staying at his dads house for the next two weeks, so we have an empty bed. I really want my boyfriend to sleep over, but I'm afraid to ask my parents since they'll probably say no. I figured i could say that since my brothers gone, he could stay in my brothers room. This tells them that we wont be doing anything, and theres the fact that they'll also be home. Its just like any other sleepover really. Any ideas on how i could approach them about this? Thanks. :)

I've heard many first date stories that are just plain scary; mostly from online dating, though yours don't have to be.  I've heard of stuff like their date being 20-30 lbs heavier than their picture, as well as their dates being men when they were expecting women.  I'm sure not everyone has experienced first dates as bad as these, but let us know anyways.

20090227135313AASOoTP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why people think sex is so important?	Hmmm...I don't - being 23 and yet a virgin I don't think it's so important. After all, it seems that sex by itself is easily achiavable.    Ok...I am NOT going to do that - but you can always rape a girl - and...yeah. Hence it's not something to aim at.    I am much more interested in problems that no one can understand: such as the concept of infinity, randomness, death. I spend about 10 hours day after day reading abotu the mathematical, philosophical, biological and other sides of such problems - and yet...nothing.   Anyway...what do ya think?      Thanks!

20090227140733AAS56DS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If a guy acts like he likes you but says he doesnt like anyone.. but still is asking who i like over and over?	Okay im in highschool. There is this boy whom i just met this year, and from the beginning of the year till now he shows all the signs of liking me. He is so sweet and he wont show it in front of his friends but when we talk and were in class or on the phone he lets me in. But latley all of our friends keep saying that we like eachother and when i told him they think that because i like funny guys, he just texted back wooooahh okay. and i told him that does not mean anything though. But since then things between us are different. Before we used to walk to class together and be really really close, now it just feels different. He used to talk to me all the time, but now he seems more distanced. and i really really like this guy. But he says he is really picky and blah. And im kind of chubby. But he said he doesnt just like a girl just because he's attracted to her she has to have personality. And i dont know what to think anymore. I want to tell him, but i really dont know if he likes me or not.  Yet when i tell him i like somebody he says i never tell him anything, and keeps asking me to tell him. And since i told him i liked somebody he has started to act like i mentioned before.SO can you please tell me your opinion. Thanks sooo muchh.. it really helps...

20090227143043AAIzO73	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I THINK THIS SECURITY GUARD WANTS ME....?	ok. today, i came back to school (after school was finished) for college class at my school. i was talking to my bff and when she opened the swinging doors to go to the staircase, this young hot security guard that likes me was standing in the doorway and just stood there starin at me and my bff and i got silent. with him standing there, it looked as if i was talking to the both of them and he was so close to me, just looking at my eyes. so i looked at him, as if saying, "can u move? im talking to my bff." i felt awkward because we were just staring at each other, so i said bye to my bff and started walking down the hall. he started walking slowly against the wall in the other direction, staring at me. then when my bff came running back to tell me something, i stopped to turn around to her and at the same time, the security guard decided to stop 2 and stared at my eyes again, a big smile(sort of blush) on his face. then he slowly walks away, still staring at me, and smiling. (note:all the security guards were supposed to be outside since the day was done, but he wasnt. he went outside after he got the chance to look at me). he liked me for a real long time now and evrytime i enter the school, his eyes immediately shifts to me and he stares. and hes always standing by my first and last classrms and walking by them. what do u think of this?

I was his first girlfriend, first kiss, first basically everything.  we broke it off for a little bit so he could date other people to see if i was what he wanted... and i waited for him. but after 6 months he had only been on 2 dates that his friend MADE him go on.  he didn't like either of them.  we started seeing eachother again and now he's pulling the same stuff. he says that he wants to know if i am what he wants for sure before settling down.  I asked if he could see himself with me 5 years from now and he says yes. i asked if he wants me right now, he says yes. i asked if his feelings could change for me he says no. so then i asked why he is confused and wanting to date others and he answers "because i'm not POSITIVE that you are the best for me" that he wants to experience the bad dates to make sure i'm actually "good". i'm sick of waiting... what should i do?

There are two girls in my class who like him but I already know he doesn't like them.

20090227133817AAnoUsb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, tell me if you have?	Tell me, have you ever been pissed off at a guy and slapped his face by planting a hand on 1 hip and staring at him, then slapping him with the other hand? I wanna know if this is used by a lot of girls, i had one that used it on me, and it worked, it confused the hell out of me so i couldn't block her hand. Have you done it? Or seen it before?
20090227132122AAhcJVh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When do you know you're over someone?	I have a 4yr old with my ex. We ended badly, and it wasn't my choice. Now because of custody, I have to see him every 3 weeks. Every time i see him, I still get butterflies etc. I have my own life now, and we live 120 miles away from each other.   Is this normal? When will I know i'm over him?   Cheers
20090227135405AAHB6oT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He's giving mixed signals... What to do?	I like a kid in my math class. He's pretty cute, with sparkly blue eyes, tannish skin, and light brown hair. He's a little bit taller than me, with pretty average body mass. He's not super preppy, but not skater or goth or anything. He seems like a pretty good guy, and pretty much fits my description of "the perfect guy."      So, in my math class, we get to choose where we sit. My teacher's pretty easygoing, and she really doesn't care. It's right after lunch. I sit in the same seat every day, with a friend behind me, behind me diagonally, and another girl to my right. Nobody sat at the desk to my left at the beginning of the school year (at least, not that I remember), and then the guy I like sat there a couple times. After a while, he sat there every day. One day at lunch, I had to take a social studies test, and got a pass to math so I wouldn't have to rush. That was fine. When I got to class late, I saw that he was sitting in the back of the class, with his friends. I was a little annoyed, and slightly confused, but I shrugged it off and went to go sit at the front of the class where I usually do. Every time during that class that I passed him, whether I was going to blow my nose or get my assigned calculator, he'd look up at me. That confused me even more. The next day, I made it to class on time again, and he's continued to sit next to me every class since. On the other hand, even though he sits right there, we almost never talk to each other, but when we do, we get really into it. Last time we got in trouble for talking so much. Does he like me as a crush, or does he just want to be friends? Or is he just being friendly??

20090227140439AAvP3E0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I Dont Know What To Do Anymore....?	So i fell in love with my best friend. We went out 2 years ago and for certain reasons, it just didn't work out. We would still talk but she was now with someone else because of that we kinda drifted apart because i still had feelings for her. They ended up breaking up and we started talking again, as friends, and one thing led to another and we got back together again. The second time we went out i was really insecure and my jealousy got the best of me, we would constantly fight and we decided we needed some time away. I tried giving her space, but she keeps pushing me away, idk if it's because she's scared of what she feels for me or because she just doesnt want to talk to me. She always tells me she doesnt wanna hurt me but this is hurting me more. Idk wat to do....
20090227142157AAcYkS6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you look at your gf/bf's parents to determine how he/she will look when they're old?	I hear it in movies all the time, and its usually the guy's friends telling him to check out the girl's mom to see if his girl has "good genes".      Obviously it not always accurate because the girl or guy can have grandma's or grandpa's genes.      Do you check out the family especially the parents of the person you are dating? And to what extend does that matter? Is it a make or break type of deal?      Im curious to hear people's logic.

So what does this mean?
20090227145915AAOfXXE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I look him in the eye?	I like this guy a lot and today, I found out that he really likes me too.   The problem is that although we're both very outgoing people, I get really shy around him because I like him so much.  I find it difficult to look him in the eye or be really comfortable and just like my normal self.  I really, really want to be 'me' but find I get frozen with shyness when he's around.      How can I get past this?
20090227143005AAZRDLn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it normal to feel so bad when I haven't talked to my boyfriend for only almost two days?	I've known my boyfriend for about a month and a half, and since the very first day that I met him, I've talked to him EVERY SINGLE day whether it was through text, online, on the phone, or in person and hes usually the one to contact me, not the other way around.      He usually texts me to say good morning and throughout school hours and calls me after school whether or not we walk home together. (but we go to different schools)      I didn't get any responses to my texts yesterday and he hasn't been online or anything. I still haven't talked to him... he told m he went over his minutes last night and he gets his phone taken away a lot so maybe thats the case.       But this is making me feel really down and whenever my phone vibrates I'm like "this better be him!"    Is it normal to miss him this much?    I'm generally not a "clingy" person what so ever and I'm not nervous or anything I don't think, I just miss him a lot.      I don't know what I can do to keep my mind off of it!
20090227143702AAYh953	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I make my boyfriend appreciate me more?	My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half now. I love him dearly and would do any and everything I can to make sure he is happy. I always find myself going out of my way to do things for him and be there whenever he calls but I don't feel he's willing to do the same for me. There are many time when we argue he fails to see my point and always believes he is right. Since the day I met him he has been a pathalogical flirt who doesn't even know he is flirting sometimes. He's gotten a lot better with his "flirtyness" but still flirts sometimes. I know he loves me, there are things he does that shows that but he doesn't go the extra mile like I always do and that's something I really need to feel as a woman-that he appreciates me beyond mention. He has never been the "mushy", affectionate type of guy but on occasion he will be. I just don't like the feeling that he doesn't appreciate me the way I do him. I need some help, especially from the guys out there on ways to change that. How can I make my boyfriend appreciate me more?
20090227142617AA2GwNp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Creepy guy: stalking or just checking me out?	Last week I was outside cleaning out my vehicle and this guy drove by in his SUV and was staring me down and going really slow.  I thought it was weird, but just shrugged it off and kept cleaning.  Today, I was walking my dog and stopped at the community mail center to pick up my mail and saw his SUV parked there.  Didn't think it was a big deal since I figured he was parked there reading his mail like a lot of people do.  I got my mail out of my box and stood there going through it, and he remained parked there.  When I finally started walking away to continue walking my dog, I heard him back out of his parking space behind me.  Then I heard him slowly following behind me as I walked.  I turned to look at him as his vehicle crept closer behind me and saw he was staring me down again.  He quickly turned the next corner and crept slowly up the street.  I suspect he was watching me cross the intersection behind him in his rear-view mirror.  After I crossed and disappeared behind the next house, I turned around and looked down the street and watched him pull into a driveway.  I got in my vehicle and drove past and got his plate number and vehicle description.        So, do I have to worry about this guy stalking me, or am I just being paranoid?  Should I tell the cop that lives across the street about this guy or just wait and see what happens first?

20090227132755AASvc0h	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's the next step?	Hi. There's a girl I like, but I didn't know how to talk to her and approach her, because I didn't know her at all. I'm also a very shy guy, so I found it difficult to just go near her and initiate a conversation in cold blood. I discovered though that she started being friends with an old female friend of mine at her age (i'm 17, they're both 15), and I re-established connections with my friend, so I can approach her easier.      My closest friends say it was a good "move". One of them, though, said that it would be better if I approached her in person, and I agreed, but first of all, I couldn't find a chance, and secondly she seems shy too, so I'm afraid of freaking her out as I'm older. Of course, I'm not planning of asking my female friend of helping me, because It will make things awkward.       Do you think I should talk to the girl I like while I speak to my friend so we get to know each other or find a seperate chance? (Girl's advice appreciated!)

20090227135356AAc92kQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Y are people so prude?	Ok so check it, basically I think I'm going to have to move to another planet where girls are very forward and there's no longer any fine line between guys being judged as "too forward" or not approaching at all.  Let's face it, everybody wants to get it on and the dating rituals that we think we need to go through to get intimate are hated by nearly everyone (at the end of the day).  I mean seriously does it really matter if a person is X or they have X or they wear X or they drink X, I mean seriously who cares, nudity and death are the great equalizers and they are both natural states of man, so please, what's the deal.  Everybody rocks.  Anybody feel me on this?

20090227143948AAPc7iQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me? I have known her since elementary?	Why I think she likes me:   1. I can see her looking at me in the corner of her eyes   2. We used to talk a lot in elementary, now I am kind of shy and etc. I used to always talk before Middle School ( I moved after elementary)   3. Her friends look at me, when I look at her I can see her friends watch me then   4. Her friends seem to look at me and talk about me   5. She sits near me, she does obvious stretching or movements to get my attention   6. Laughs at everything I say, even if it is not meant to be funny    (in a good way)   7. When I look at her and she catches me looking at her, she either turns away quickly or I do   8. Im smart, good-lucking and nice. But as always, I am shy   9. She packs up really fast and takes a long time to leave, I think she is nervous and wants me to talk to her   10. She teases me      I have never asked a girl out before and I am in High school, I am not ugly but I do not know what to talk about with a girl...... I know how to talk with most guys, but I keep thinking a girl will reject me if I say the wrong thing

I am his first girlfriend and I know he was so inlove when we were together. He would give me everything that will make me happy. He spoiled me as hell. He keep telling me that he would never leave me as long as i would be nice to him...but I made him cry many times.   He was having a problem with his visa and I was stress in school, so I was pist and didnt talk to him for months.   I missed him so i called him. He said he made up his mind. He said he thought I moved on so he decided to move on. I was totally shocked and unconvinced. How could be a loving person turned out so cold?   I was crying like hell and I beg him to forgive me and give our relationship another chance. He said he already promised his parents that he will marry anyone they fix for him. Later on, he told me he wasn't happy with all the fix marriage. I kept texting him and sending him letter how much I love him and I want him back. He just kept saying it's too late and he can't go back. Then he said I should stop txting him love notes because it would be good for other people. I asked him if it irritate him or if he thinks its all BS he said no. I asked him if i still call him .......(we used to call each other meaning love) he said yes i can call him whatever I want. We talk on the phone like we are still together except that he isnt saying i miss you,i love you or such.Since his going home I asked him if his excited. He keep telling me that his not excited and happy at all. He just want to get his visa and he said he will be mad until he gets his visa to come back in Us.He said his gonna call me if he gets his visa. Then I asked him if is he going to call me when he get married? He laugh at me and said "sure, u will be the first to know!" Then he asked me if i'm happy, so I told him straight, not at all. I asked him same question and told me he is not happy and all he care is to get his visa.I am so confused!   I felt like he still love me, but just worried of something.

20090227131758AAgBfZF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i put a family at risk for break up?	i dated my girlfriend more than 10 years ago.  things didnt work out then, so we moved on.  recently, we got back together.  she has a child.  as we got back together, she asked me to live with her and her child.  i hesitated at first not knowing what to expect but went ahead and did so because i thought we were under the understanding that we'd raise this child together and have another one of our own in time.  soon after movng in, i didnt like some of what i saw but kept quiet cuz i didnt think it was my place just yet to say anything.  she got mad at this so i eventually opened up with my feelings and she got mad at what i had to say.  over the last 5 months, we share almost no time together, she initiates no sex with me and when i try, usually i'm turned down.  she spends more time on the computer, working and sleeping than we do talking.  at night, unless i go to get her from her kids room, she wont even come to bed because the child cant seem to sleep by himself.  recently, while standing next to her, i seen an instant message screen pop up from her out of state friend that had a message reading something to the effect of "you have to warn me when he's around".  when i asked her about it, she said it's because if she didnt tell her "friend" i was near, then she could chat online for hours instead of doing something like cuddling with me on the couch or something.  thing is, a typical afternoon over the last few months has been she comes home from work, eats dinner the either: cuddles with her son on couch watching tv, plays video games, works or surfs the internet which is where her "friend" always seems to be.  so what she said made no sense but because i love her, i didnt want to argue.  what i seen didnt sit well with me so i checked her im log and seen conversations between the two that were really intimate in nature--- like him coming here and only the two of them would be in bed, not me-- and so on things like that.  she says she loves me and i think we get along, but knowing this is killing me.  furthermore, this "friend" is married with a baby and lives out of state.  i want to ask her about all this but i am so affraid of losing her.  my brain says just take off, but im in love with her and i have grown really attached to her child.  i have proof of all of this and probably quite easily let her "friends" wifey know about this and run the risk of destroying that family.  i dont want to do that but fear that out of anger, i just might IF i confront my girlfriend about this.  what i did was wrong looking into her computer but feel that what she's been doing is just as if not worse!  like i said, we havnt been intimate, little affection and have no time together ever, yet, she manages to do this?  what should i do?

20090227131928AAd3hAr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get over my insecurity before it ruins my relationship?	I am engaged and going to be married in a few months.  My Fiance is this wonderful man.  Most of my past relationships were horrible and I dated guys that constantly lied and cheated.  My previous boyfriend was the worst!  He was married and I didnt know until I thought things were suspicisou and I did some investigating.  My past has really scarred me.  I have recently found out that my Fiance has been talking to a woman that he met on Match 5 years ago.  He told me this.  They never met because she stood him up etc.  She found him thru IM in August.  She knows he is getting married and he does talk a lot about me.  They havent talked often, until recently.  She is very forward and jokes about them being together.  He doesnt buy into this.  But, I am very worried because I think they are talking more.  She has finally told him that she does have a bf.  But, why didnt she tell him this before?  She lives about 2 hours away, in a city where he used to live.  We are going there next weekend and he said she should come out and meet us.  She said she would come with her bf.  I am very insecure about this and the frequent talking.  I dont understand why he needs to talk to her, its not like they were long lost friends.  They have never even meet!!!  We got into a HUGE fight last night because I dont want him talking to her.  He keeps saying that I am insecure and its driving him crazy.  I have been insecure with other girls in the past but I really think this is legitmate.  Why should they be talking much less meeting us out?  He also says that I am jealous with every woman with a V------A!!!  Please help!

My dad needed surgery, we went for a consultation with a Dr. at first I did not notice him, but by the 2nd visit i saw him staring at me, then the eye contact with neither of us looking away, we smile etc., the surgery comes and goes i send him a plant, he calls to say thanks we speak and laugh and then i say mayb we can go out sometime, he says that would be great BUT we must wait until I have finished treating your dad. I go back for the subsequent visits and we talk and stare and smile.  i know he is attracted to me and treament will end in June, I am wondering if I will have to call him or if he will call me and even if he really will want to still go out. I have his cell number I never call because i undertand he is still treating my dad. There is a age difference of about 18 years, but that should be no problem.  I am a litigator so we are intellectually compatible as well. I really like what I know of this man..
20090227132420AAmhCpa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What will it take to get over my boyfriend?	My long-distance boyfriend and I broke up about 4 days ago after being together on and off for 3 years, and it is all I have been thinking about.  I am being stronger than expected though, which is good.  The main thing I am worried about is that I'll always have that "What could we have been" in the back of my mind.  I don't want to be engaged to another man and still have my ex-boyfriend on my mind.  We had great chemistry, but lately we have had zero patience for one another.  There is a 5 year age difference as well, and he was ready to get more serious, where as I at 19, wanted to enjoy life.  Has anyone ever got over their first love and met someone else that was better for them?

We hung out again the next weekend, and we made out for a while. Since then, we've hooked up a few more times, and i really like her and she likes me.

20090227140259AA1CtbT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does anybody else find this to be weird? my boyfriend and his girl couisn constanly call each other ....?	The weird part is that he calls her more the he calls me during the day and he can talk to her for like 10 minuets to 30 minuets when they call each other. He can’t call me while he is working or doesn’t ever talk to me for more then 2 minuets. He tells me he is so busy at work he can’t talk but why is that when she calls he can talk to her? She can call from the time he wakes up till the evening and he calls her during the day. He never calls her in front of me or he never answers when she calls and when im with him and she calls he hangs up on her or ignores her calls. He never calls he at nite when hes with me but the nites I don’t stay with him he calls her. I don’t no whats the deal with that. What makes me a little upset is on Valentines’ day she text and called him and told him she wanted him to take her out and she wanted to see him as if she though he wasn’t going to spend V-day with me. What I find weird is she send him text messages and leaves him voice mails and she is being weird and really flirty with him she calls him babe,daddy,huny and sweetie and she talks as if he is a guy she has a crush on. I know they talk to each other flirty but Am I crazy for thinking this is weird? My boyfriend has told me he don’t think its wrong to mess around with your cousin before but I don’t know if he was joking or being serious? So that’s why the whole thing with them talking/calling each other so much gross's me out and the way she talks to him . What do you guys think? Am I being dumb or would this bother you a little to?

20090227142201AAlEupI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Typical Question, Complex Scenario: Does this girl like me?	Well, here is the whole whopping story.      It all started when I began to talk to this girl in school. We had a class together a year before, but we never spoke to one another (I was far too shy back then. Surprising how quickly you can change in just a year), but I think I could have occassionally caught her glancing at me (Being a year ago, I can't recall everything as well).      Well, here I am this year (2008, actually. A few months into the beginning of the school year) and I decided to talk to her for a change. So, I marched up to her one day in the halls and started talking to her. Immediatly, she recognized me from that class last year, and we talked for a little.      Problems eventually began, though, when it came down to rarely seeing her and just as rarely talking to her. I decided to call it off for now, because I knew it wouldn't get anywhere with how it was (and the fact that she was also very busy). In a semi-desperate attempt, I did ask her to a dance, but I received the predicted "I don't know you very well" response.      Months went on, and classes changed. She wound up being in one of my new classes, and my interest sparked up again. At first, I waited for her to perhaps say something, but after noticing signs of shyness (Playing around with her hair or adjusting her clothes constantly when she talks) I figured I'd go ahead and speak up (One thing I should note is that I've never seen her do those actions anywhere else or around anyone else or at any other time. She performs in a lot of plays/musicals and sings a lot...it doesn't seem like she would be shy in a small classroom...). I got her talking easily, and I find we have plenty in common...you know the usual good conversational qualities.      The day before Valentine's Day, I surprised her by giving her a red Rose. She was overjoyed (the reaction was phenominal), and carried it with her the whole day (which I wasn't even expecting; I'd thought she would have at least stored it somewhere safe).      The next week, there wasn't any school, but once we returned, she was very talkative with me, and opened up a lot. So I decided to hopefully build on that ground I had and asked her to hang out sometime. She told me she would check if she is available and tell me the next day.      That's when it seems like something went bad. She didn't talk to me immediatly that day. I had to approach her later in the hall (lucky that I was passing by her) and asked her what was happening, which it turned out she was busy (I'm safely assuming she is legit on that, as well). She DID, however, stop talking to her other friend to talk to me and answer me, and payed attention to me up until I left her, though it's not like the conversation lasted very long anyway.      She hadn't spoken to me at all for the rest of this week, and it just feels like she could be ignoring me. One little detail I've noticed is that she looks away from me whenever I pass her in the hall, or she'll immediatly look to whichever friend is closest and talk to them.      As far as looking at me in class goes, she sits in a position with a clear line of sight to eachother, but my vision isn't the best so I can't always tell if she is glancing over at me or not (I especially have almost no vision in my left eye [Aphakia], which happens to be the relative position of her seat, and she has a friend who sits next to her on the right, making an easy excuse to look in that direction).      Maybe I'm just over-reacting and should be patient and try to talk to her next week, but regardless, do you think these are any indication that she has interest in me? Or if she might have lost interest in me?      Some extra details that may not have fit into the story:      Whenever I talk to her, she doesn't concentrate on anything else at all. She seems to ignore or pay less attention to friends that approach her at the time (some of them are guys, too), and on Monday she nearly ran into a blantly-obvious door-divider (pole) in the middle of a rather wide hallway (one of her friends even commented towards her on it) and if I waited for her after class, she would always greet me first and smile. Of course, this was before the whole 'seemingly avoiding me' part.

He says whatever he wants to me, and if I tell him I don't like it he accuses me of picking a fight.  He always wants to be right.  I tell him the things he says to me are mean and hurtful, and he accuses me of trying to control how he talks.  He says its my own fault if my feelings get hurt because he can't control how I react to what he says.  Sometimes I get so angry that I feel sick.  Sometimes I get overwhelmed and yell.  I don't call him names but I do say cuss words and then he accuses me of having double standards.  I'm depressed and sometimes wish I could just die and be done with it all.        Today I told my husband I feel there is no more hope.  He tried to apologize but I didn't want to accept it anymore.  He says he wants to work on it, but I think he just wants me to change and to just believe along with him that he is always right.  He says he tries to change but nothing he does is ever enough and I'm still never happy.

20090227150639AAA9Mjx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need to break it, suggestions? xx?	I just asked this but I don't think people understand my level of stress! I feel like I need to break my hymen before me and my boyfriend have sex, I dint want it to be painful and I can't even get half a finger up without it hitting a solid wall that feels like it'll be there forever - Is this the hymen? Is it possible it wouldn't break on the first time? Is there an easy way of breaking it so the first time will even be pleasurable? I just don't want to be paniced, and I get paniced easily. Thank you x
20090227161839AAu0VSa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I love my husband to death, but one thing that he does really annoys me?	He won't let me cry! And I don't mean that he tries to comfort me to keep me from crying. It's almost like he gets made or fed up or something.      I'm not the type of person that cries a lot. If we argue, it takes a lot to get me to cry. If I've been stressed for a long time, I may start to cry if something is said in the wrong tone. There have been maybe two times since I have known him (about 5 years) that I have started crying for almost no reason.      Is anyone else's spouse like this? I've tried telling him just to leave it alone and let me cry, and that picking at me isn't going to help anything, but he doesn't listen. What can I say to him? It really irritates me that he gets crappy about it, and in turn, I usually end up crying more.      I'm sure this seems humorous to some of you, but I'm really at a loss.
20090227155518AAiebHL	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I being too harsh on my sister?	About three years ago, my sister got married in secret. The only way that any of us (as in her siblings) found out was through Facebook. (To this day, I've never met the guy.) Next thing you know, she was pregnant. Mind you, my sister's still in college and hasn't completed her first degree yet. She ended up having the baby and throughout the course of her relationship with her husband, she's been arrested, doing drugs (smoking weed while pregnant) and prostituting herself on craigslist. She's been evicted from two apartments (the first one was in her husband's name, the second in hers) as well as cursed out my parents (who've been supporting her financially) and my other sister (who's babysat her son numerous times - for free!) and tried to pull that mess on me (I stop her dead in her tracks because I don't take garbage from anyone).      Since her secret marriage, she's ended up getting divorced as it turned out the guy was just using her for citizenship. Well, that's the story that she tells us. Recently, she's shipped her son off to another country (mind you, she's never been there herself - they both went there together for the first time last month) and left her son there with his father's relatives (I think she's met them all of twice). For me, leaving her son in a country that people are trying to get out of themselves was the last straw. I refuse to talk to her or even acknowledge her presence. I thank God that we live in separate states because she honestly gets on my last nerve.      My family has been through a lot in the past three years with her and I'm sick of it. I know that I wasn't a perfect child but I would never have done this garbage to anyone. I've refused to allow her anywhere near my life and my parents are trying to give me grief over it.      Do you think that I'm being too harsh on my sister?

Do you think he was about to talk to me? Why didn't he? What can I do?(please do not say talk to him)
20090227155903AATPAb1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dating / Relationship Question?	So I've been going out with my boyfriend for a month now, and I'm liking how things are going. I'm a young teen, so it's not really anything "super" serious, but please no comments saying I'm too young. :)       I've noticed that my boyfriend really prefers going on group dates instead of only, me and him. However, I prefer going out with just us two. ): We have been on one date where it was just him and me, but the rest of the times, it's been a large group.      We're thinking of doing something soon, again with a group. But the problem is, it's a group of girls and guys who I don't talk with much. The rest of them are best friends, .. it's just me. I know I'll feel uncomfortable and awkward, and I really don't want that. But I do want to spend time with him.       What do you guys think I should do? I have tried telling him before, but he says it's going to be okay and not awkward, and attempts to avoid the question..  How should I act on the upcoming date?       Hahas, sorry, I'm confusing.   But any help is appreciated,   xoxo. (:

The only thing that's keeping me away to introduce myself to him is my shyness and nervousness around him. He doesn't know me at all. If I start a conversation with him, what sort of things should I talk about with him. He only sees me once in a while because I'm in 9th grade and he's in 11th so we don't have any classes together. Do you think that's kind of wrong for him to be 2 grade levels higher than me? Do you think it would be awkward? If you do please tell me. Thanks so much.   = )

20090227161100AAERrYD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you ever feel after college you start settling?	Today my teacher said stop worrying about dating, you probably won't even marry any of your boyfriends/girlfriends you dated in highschool. Then she started talking about how 50% of couples married met in college, however I fired back with 50% of couples married ended up divorced. And it made me think do people settle after college when it comes to marriage? You really mature once you graduate and then you think the next adventure in life is to get married, so you tie the knot with your current girlfriend/boyfriend and some don't even think twice about it. That really annoys me, I'll marry who want and I don't care where I met them, be it college, highschool, clown school-it doesn't matter to me.   Anyone else agree?

20090227161812AAGqJ0w	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why would my friend react this way with me?	Okay so I am married and have been for just 2 years but together for a total of 10 years. I have a very close guy friend that I have been friends with for quite some time. However, something happened recently and I am unsure what to make of it. Me and my husband sometimes have issues because he likes to go out a lot and I allow him because I don’t want to cause fights and I know he does deserve to have fun although last year there was an incident that gives me reason to not trust him because he was caught red handed doing something wrong but I chose to forgive him and move on.    In any event my best guy friend does know about this because I needed someone to talk to and vented to him at the time. Well the other night my guy friend asked how me and my husband were doing I said we are okay you know that my husband still likes to go out a lot but you know things are ok. Well my friend then kind of went of on me he said the following to me in a way of a rant in a bit of a feisty voice:      “You are a dream wife. But you know what in this case especially if someone wants to take advantage of you I think things are your fault to because you don’t yell at your husband and tell him he can’t go out and question what he was doing. You know you aren’t his property that he can think he can just put you up on a shelf to wait around while he goes out and has fun and then take you down from the shelf whenever he needs you for minute. Your not just something on the floor for him to step over or through in the wash machine whenever he feels. You know I see you 30 years down the line in the same situation still married to him meanwhile he has had 3 kids with other women and bunch of diseases and your still going around like “tra la la la la” I know you won’t admit it but you are just to afraid to leave, I know you love him but I know your not happy but you are just to scared to leave him. You never will. And I am telling you this because I don’t want you to ever say to me “well you never said anything” because honestly if your husband isn’t listening when you tell him how you feel well then he is just stupid”      Since then he has been distant and ignorning me when I text him so yesterday I gave him a hard time about ignoring me I was just trying to be silly and he responded and said "What do you mean ignorning you?

Should I have done what I've done?	this morning when i was going to school, i was late to school so i was kinda in a rush. my mom was at work so it was only my dad who was home...(btw i have a lil brother who's a ***** and started everything!)      he in the bedroom changing so i told him to stay out but he woul just say "I HAVE TO GET MY CLOTHES COZ IM LATE!" n i would say "WAIT! your fault u take a long time in the bathroom."      So it was already 8! school stats 8:10. i was finally done changing so then my bitchy brother went in to change after waiting in the living room for 15 mins. suddenly i realized i left my backpack in the bedroom so i bunged in back into the bedroom to get it. my brother wasn't even changing n started throwing a tantrum. he was like.."NO, GET OUT, NOW, COZ U WOULDN'T LET ME COME IN FOR A SEC JUSS TO GET ,TO CLOTHES AND SO WHY SHOULD I LET YOU IN?? out!!"      I told him jus a sec. (LITERALLY!)   THEN, my father came and was like "no you didnt let him in so why now you have to wait!"   (Oh and did i mention that my bro is in the 4th grade n is my fathers fave child!!)   then my brother took a long time on PURPOSE in the bedroom so i would be late so school. he came out 8:30 and i smacked him real hard. That's when my father came and beat me SO MUCH with a broom for my brother (even though it was just a slap!) . i started to cry n ran into the bedroom. i was angry as HELL! my father is so racist against women. he only cares for the guys/boys in the house. (his sons) and not me. he never was concerned about my life. EVER! (DON'T tell me he is, b/c i KNOW he's not)   then my father saw me cry and just cursed me out and told me if i ever touched my brother, he'd kick me out of the house. after hearing that i was SO PISSED that i went into his wallet (he left at home and he wnt to drop my bro to school) and RIPPED 40 dollars!! (20 bills!)      then just cried myself to sleep.      so i missed a whole day of school. who's right? should i have done what i done??      I'm 13 btw and my brother's 10.

20090227155439AAbIIRo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do guys get majorly jealous too?	have many insecurities. I am a female. I was wondering if guys in a relationship ever got insecure and jealous because I've noticed guys can talk for ages about who they think are hot, but if girls do it, the guys seem a little put out as well. So, do guys worry that they are not good enough for their girlfriends? If so, how can you reassure them that you like them and only them?

20090227154641AAld5YF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Wife wants to talk to other woman?	alright, About a year ago I was involved in an affair with a married man (please no mean comments, I know it was wrong and do regret it). It was a sex only relationship nothing more (neither of us wanted anything more than that), we worked together so it was easy to hide as we had to spend alot of time together alone at work. He did recently decide to tell his wife everything, all she really wants to know is why it happened, and he has given her his side, but she wants to talk to me?!?! I don't know if I should, and if I do what i should say! (again, please no lectures.) I know this part sounds selfish, but I am really worried that she will get out around town now, and wonder if talking to her or not talking to her might prevent this! I don't know! help!   Thank you!

20090227162208AAFtuZZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do his signs make him seem interested?	Ok, so there's this guy I like.  His locker is right next to mine, and we're already friends.  He talks to me a lot at our lockers, especially after school.  After we're done getting books at our lockers and stuff in between classes, he'll walk with me to my next class, even if he might be late to his.  He asks a lot, where I'll be headed.  He walked me to my bus before, too.  And I find he likes to joke around with me a lot.  We're always laughing, and he smiles when I talk to him.  One time, he bumped into me "accidentally" in the hallway when I was walking by him, so then we started walking together & chatting.  He's complimented me before, saying I'm nice too. And lastly, after we're done talking, he'll say bye and then my name, or talk to ya later, and then my name.  I'm just not sure his signs make him seem interested because a while back, my one guy friend asked him if he liked me, and he said he thought I was pretty and nice, but only sees me as a friend. Could he have had a change in heart? Feedback would be much appreciated.
20090227155536AAaK0W5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did I marry the wrong man?	Well the guy in question has been best friends with me since highschool. We always had a crush on each other but were too afraid to admit it. Finally a year after we got together but at the time he went into the Army. He was gone for 5 months without ability for communication. I thought I lost him...until after the  months he proposed to me out of the blue. I had to turn it down because at the time I was in college and wanted to move to FL when he was moving to the base in Alaska. Before he left I was with him at a friends and slept with him for the first time of many years.But...I'd also found another guy (ill call him Eagle) the 5 months he wasn't able to talk to me because I was heartwrenched...After that night I wanted to marry the army guy but never said anything...      Three years later I'm married with Eagles child & Army guys engaged. But me and Army guy still have feelings for each other, & despite our current situation, if me & Army guy were left alone sparks would fly.Army guys coming home again in 2 months and he wants to hang out again(i missed him the first time cuz i was out of town)....Me and army guyalways got along and always were the best of friends and have been talking all these years and always seem to find each other(i just moved recently & i found out he's moving close to my new location by surprise!) Eagle guy and I never got along and only been together for 3 years...Did I make the right spouse choice?      BTW- Army guy recently bought me a $600 laptop out of "friendship" and offered me anything I wanted. The only other person he did this too was his fiance and none of his other friends, male or female.

20090227161942AAB8GhP	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	This boy is acting funny around me. Does he just hate me or does he feel ...shy around me?	A while back I tried talking to this boy because he was friends with a couple of girls that I was friends with. I normally don't like talking to boys and this is why; next thing I knew my little sister was telling me that she overheard him telling all of his friend I was "like, in love" with him. 0///0 (my first reaction) THAT MORON! (my second reaction)  So, naturally I tried to ignore him. I'd avoid him, and whenever he talked to my friends I'd walk off with a frown. (idiot) But now I keep catching him looking at me. And apparently he acts really quiet around me and possibly even shy? (according to my friend, who also gave me a funny, sly look when he acted that way) <.<   When I stand in line next to him he scoots up as far as possible. I'm certain he just thinks I'm a weirdo, but I can't shake the feeling it might be something else (because of my friends raised eyebrows "oh!!!!!" reaction). As usual, I'm just as confuzzled as ever.... -///-

20090227151256AAOSupV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A great guy - why do I want to RUN away?	So I always wanted that fairy tale romance, marriage, kids, the whole 9 yards. Usually I ended up with the bad boy type, which made things really hot, but they never worked out. Now I met a great man who is sweet and romantic, and he wants the whole 9 yards too. But we've been dating for only a month and he already said I am "The one", which really freaked me out and now I start thinking of all the things I can find wrong with him, to give myself a reason to run. I keep trying to tell myself what a great guy he is, and that should be what I really want... but I don't seem to feel that romantic spark with him. So I tried to tell him that I needed more time, that things were going to fast and I'm not sure how I feel yet. He freaked out and started acting like I broke up with him, asking if that meant I didn't want him to talk to me anymore, and if there was another guy... then said that I confused him so much he doesn't know how to act around me. So NOW this gives me a whole new urge to bolt because it seems like he's really clingy and insecure, which is a turn off. What should I do? He's just one of those great guys that are hard to find... Is it possible that the 'spark' can still develop, or is it just something that isn't there and I should move on now?
20090227155310AAKVQuK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife was raped... Is that cheating?	My wife and I were walking the streets of NYC. I found a store that was selling chap stick which we needed because of the cold, and my wife wanted to stay outside. When I came out, my wife was missing. I looked everywhere. I yelled her name down alleyways near the store.  I figured she was still mad at me from a quarrel we had while walking. I was exhausted so I went back to our room in the Double Tree Hotel, she wasn't there- so I figured she went to her sisters apartment because she didn't have a room key, so I hit they hay and woke up in the morning- still not knowing. I received a call from the hospital while I was eating my breakfast. They told me my wife had been raped. Her jaw was broken, she also had major muscle spasms in her neck. In utter confusion I rushed to the hospital. She was in the bed wrapped up in casts. 5 days later she was sent home. Over the next month and still now I question if this rape can considered an act of my wife cheating on me. This is serious. I have anxiety attacks and am extremely paranoid. Please tell me, I'm in need of help.

I was with my x finacee for over 4 years now and recently around 1 and a half year ago he started treated me really bd like swearing at me, pruposely saying hurtfull things, leaving me over little things and most of all when ever he was with his mates if i eva called he dint used to answer. I took him bk time after time tinking he will change, i stayed really good to him n he was da only guy ive ever loved. I met him when i was 18 and im now 22. I feel so hurt, he left me because i told him to calm down chilling with his friends and find a job if he wanted a future for us but all he ever wanted to do was go out with his friends.      I put up with this because i taut he is only 21 a few months younger than me but when it started effectin our relationship it really started depressing me as he dint wanna know me n e more. I feel so hurt and i just cant get over him. I really loved him n he broke my heart. I think the hardest thing is i understanding he prob dint love me n e more.       I just dont know wat to do n e more, i miss having someone there. But i cant take him back into my life anymore because he comes back and makes faulse promises saying he will be good and stop turning his phone off n dissing me, but its only a matter of days when he does it again.      I really dont know wat to do anymore, he really broke my heart and i trusted him with it. I hate the fact that i cry over him cuz while im here upset hes out playing pool with his mates and driving round in cars doing god knows wat.      I have turned my fne off but he knows where i live and when it suits him he will come back and beg me to get back with him, and because i love him so much i dont wanna let him go so i get back with him. I know im a idiot for gettin back with him but im sure theres so many women out there who understand y i do it.      Can someone please give me some tips in helping me to get over him. Please cuz i really am at a standstill crying every nite and thinking why he hurt me like this and why my tears were never enough for him to give me the love and respect that i deserve.

20090227155742AAbIkg8	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would it be weird if i texted him?	so i met this guy last week, and he seemed really cool. so I talked to him online a bit and he mentioned that he may have some people get together at his house tonight for a little party. Then he said if i wasn't busy then i could text him and see what was going on then, because he still wasn't sure. However I don't want to seem too desperate texting him and asking him if it's going on, when i don't know him that well. I would really like to go tonight, but would it be weird?
20090227155804AA9rYRt	Family & Relationships;Friends	Concerned...Abusive Situation?	I am very concerned about one of my dear friend's current situation. I am very concerned that she could potentially be in an abusive situation or the beginnings of one with her father. She is always saying how much she hates being at home and is currently not allowed to leave her house almost ever to do anything...even when she's at church her father will call her and get upset because she is "never home". She is always saying that she can't wait to graduate because as soon as she does she's going to move out. I've also noticed that she is constantly getting close to guys that are not the best influences. She recently described her father as very needy and calls him names that i would never in a million years call my dad. She also thinks "that's what she said jokes" are insanely funny.    I could just be over-reacting but I get the feeling that there is something very wrong going on at her house. My friend is one of the most kind people I know and I don't want her to be abused in any way. Should I ask her about it? Should I just wait a little longer to see if it gets worse? What should I do?

20090227162030AAheIEg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you take the Lie Detector or Not?	If you gave your spouse a reason to think you were cheating i.e. had a secretive myspace account where you messaged others inappropriately, showed intent to meet but never seen messages saying you did, and got caught and confessed to it and then your spouse and you agree at this point your going to move forward, leave past in past, and your spouse stated they believed you never met the people nor cheated after you came clean about it all and swaring on your kids, mom, unborn child and then 2 weeks later your spouse states "Hey although we said we would work on it I still have doubts I need you to take that test" would you. I'm at the point where if my spouse is teling the truth and knows all I want is a test to prove it why not shut me up and take it? On their defense they said I forgave them, said I'd move on, and after making them sware on our children its still not good enough that regardless of a test I will never believe them and this is one of those things I am just gonna have to believe because if not it shows they will never be able to rebuild their trust with me. I just dont get it if theres nothing to hide why not? My spouse states its a slap in the face and Will Not take it yet I believe my spouse but then when I start thinking about them declining the test it makes me wonder... Please tell me of you were in my spouses situation would you or would you not and just continue to know that this is something that if I had the test would know

20090227163929AAfpVyM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I just forget it..or not?	I sent someone I hadn't seen in 4 years a friend request last wednesday.I added a personal note about how I knew him from my old church,and I saw him at a game a couple weeks ago and remembered him.And I ended it with the generic but classic question, HOW ARE YOU?    He accepted the friend request within 10 minutes.But...He didn't reply to the note?BUT….Tonight I was messing around on facebook,and looked at the “friends online” tab…and GUESS WHO WAS ONLINE!    So,GUYS...IS IT LIKE COMMONPLACE TO NOT ANSWER A PERSONAL NOTE WITH A FRIEND REQUEST?This guy is 17,and a varsity bball player (till the season ended).If that makes any difference :P I would like to get to know him again,but I don’t even know where to start!Or should I just give up and be greatful he accepted the friend request at all?    Also… what would be the best way (on FB)   -chat (but then you gotta sit around and wait for him to come on for a brief second)   - wall   -msg   -poke   Also…how long to wait before attempting to say hi?Should  I just not bother at all?
20090227164545AAzanJQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would be your reaction if your spouse told you the reason they married you?	was because of your looks?   My husband and I had a talk today for the first time in a long time.  I asked him why he married me and his response was that looks were very important to him.  He said he always thought I was very pretty and still does.  When I told him I wanted to be liked (loved) for the kind of person I was, he was silent.  I told him other people compliment me for my personality as well as looks, and make me feel good about myself.  When I'm around him, I don't.
20090227163616AANK5Df	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A guys definition of 'hot'?	We all know that when a guy says a girl is hot that he just wants to do her. Well my best guy friend is always bringing up girls and saying they're hot, but he always has a reason for not dating them. He never says that I'm hot (to my face at least) and maybe that's a good thing, but I'm also wondering if maybe I don't look good enough for him to date me. So my question is, if a guy says a girl is 'hot', then doesn't that mean that 9 times out of 10 he wouldn't date the girl, and that if the phrase "That girl is pretty hot" is used, then isn't it mostly just a comment? Like how girls would say wow that guy looks good, but probablly wouldn't date the guy?

20090227163530AA8I3Uw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should High Schools be allowed to open brothels?	As you all know high school can be a very hard time for teenagers. Boys often feel very lonely and in need of female affection. Unfortunately many high school boys just don't have enough game to get a girlfriend. With hormones out the roof this is a recipe for major depression which can lead to suicide.      So should High Schools and Universities be aloud to open brothels so that these teenage boys have and outlet to release their sexual frustration?
20090227162532AAFRPnJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Ugh; best friend + boy problemss? help?	Ok so i have this friend and she's going out with a guy. Well my friend is actually a really nice and innocent person; she rarely cusses, she doesn't do drugs, and she's a virgin and all that good stuff. The guy shes going out with is a total player though. he smokes and drinks (ive seen him) and he has sex and goes out with a different girl almost every week. before him and my friend were officially going out, (well he liked her and asked her out but they weren't comfortable yet) he cheated on my friend and made out with another girl. i saw this so i told victoria and she was barely upset! she was a little curious and nervous but apparently the guy said this to her: "i'm sorry. I was wrong, i'll never do it again." and she forgave him; just like that! she trusts him 100% but the whole school knows that he's got a bad reputation. just the other day, he convinced my friend to ditch school for the whole day and walked to a hill; someone called the cops and when they looked in his backpack there were condoms and drugs. I mean, was he seriously thinking he could get something from my friend? then he invited some more of his gangster friends which my friend DID NOT KNOW AT ALL, COMPLETE STRANGERS and agreed to go to one of the kids' house and "eat pizza." each and every one of them had drugs tho! and condoms! my friend is so clueless next she'll show up in school pregnant and with a cigarette in her mouth. i really don't know what to do, she's so blind and i want to help her because i know the guy is a bad person but she doesn't realized that. i just i don't know what to do because she's a really good friend but whatever i tell her, she won't believe me. my other friends tell her too and she won't believe them either. help me? thanks.

20090227170459AAKpeQ7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I stop my friends' relationship?	(man I hate my computer) Anyway,   My friend met this guy in June. Since then it's all she talkes about and it annoys all of us. All she says is she LOVES  him and it's all she went for turning down every guy who attempts to like her.   She said they would never break up and they would be togethe forever but she fell in love with his internet brother. Then everything happened all over again. Just recently he asked her to marry him, she said yes. She's 13 and he's 16. She really thinks she's getting married now but I know it's not what she thinks.   In reality there are two guys that love her more and I'm sure would offer more but she keeps turning them down.    How do I get her out of this relationship?

We got separated after he physical threw me down, shoved me, and grabbed me, and had been verbally abusing me for a couple of yrs...we went through counseling and the loss of my brother, we ended up getting back together. He has since for months now been different and non abusive and considerate MOST of the time. He has been there for me when my brother was killed, and seems to care about me. However, I am still having terrible flashbacks of his abuse, and am terrified sometimes that he will start doing it again....I have not told him this, and we cannot afford further counseling right now. He realizes that he was wrong with what he did, and tries with success to control his temper but still!! I cant forgive him. He never has said he was sorry for what he did...I cant live with these flashbacks but I dont want to leave the father of my 14 month old just yet. I dont know what to do!! Help! I am on anti-depressants already, please dont suggest that....
20090227163457AAwMYJP	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I stuck in the "Friend zone"?	Ok a year ago I went out with this girl. It ended kind of suddenly with lots of rumors and lies. We didn't speak for months and then we suddenly started talking again. We flirt and all that kind of thing but when she said something about boys not likeing her I joked around saying "you could have me". Suddenly she went into this whole stand-offish thing and it was pretty awkward. Then I said "Oh right, I don't really think of you that way to be honest." and she said "ohhh right well I was just..." and then sort of drifted off without finishing. Have I ruined my chances?

20090227163859AA8pUur	Family & Relationships;Friends	I really dont know what to do anymore.?	I have these fabulous 3 friends, Esty, Karen, and Yuval. So I am very good friends with Esty.       But, I get mad at her quite often. I dont do it on purpose, I just can't forget about my madness. But, now I am mad at Esty again, and she did something VERY hurtful.       It might sound very weird now, but when it actually happened, it was worse and made me feel very bad.       We were in art class, and I told her to come sit beside me. She said no, and she always listens to what I say. Obviously, now that she didn't listen to what I said, it must have been a very good reason why she didn't. At the end, she said 'it was because Yuval would be alone.' I said 'Well, you dont care when I'm sitting alone, and you won't come or invite me there, but it matters alot when Yuvals alone?' She said yes, so I got really mad. I was sitting by myself at art, and when we went on a shocol feildtrip, she didn't even say hi or anything, and ignored me the whole time.       When I talked to her, she said it was because she didn't want to leave Yuval alone, but she had no problem with leaving me alone. That was what got me madder.       I have thought about npoot being friends with her anymore EVER again, like I have done MANY times with other friends. I have no problem doing that, because friends are supposed to take away your tears, not produce them.       But, the problem is that Esty is going to be with Yuval the whole time, and I don't want to hang out with her anymore.       So I don't know what to do.       I don't want to not hang out with Yuval.       I have Karen, but she can't be my only friend. I don't want to make new friends, because I am tired of changing friends every 6 months.       I also odn't think I will forgive Esty, she is causing me misery. But, when were not in fights, she is the BEST friend possible.      Tell me what to do!

20090227163121AAK5mye	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why didn't he EVER care?	I USED to be friends with my guy friend for 1 year but that ended last week when he told me that he wanted to hangout soon hopefully but never does. I texted him saying why am I even friends with someone who never responds back or makes an effort. I was going to tell you that I liked you but see theres no point b/c you lie & never have the guts to respond to my texts. No response. Then I said I'm not going to be friends with someone who can't be a friend back. I have taken him back tons of time but not this time. This is the last time you will hear from me. Then he texts the next morning saying :Uh I definitely just got all those texts...If you don't wanna be my friend that's fine. I told you so many times I just wanted to be friends but i guess you didn't really catch that point. I apologize if you feel like I've wrong you & I wish you the best.    P.S. He broke up with his g/f of 2 years last August but she cheated on him with his best friend & said that he would never talk to her. He STILL talks to her & lied. WTF!? Why did he never care about me?

20090227170526AAkwcdD	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom calls me all of the time!?	I am newly married. My mom calls me all of the time. At least 3-4 times a day. I really don't like talking on the phone. I've told her this casually. I call her sometimes just for a short time to try and prevent her from calling as much so that way I can talk the length of time I want and let her go, and that doesn't work. I really wish I wasn't just an only child and there were some other kids at home with her or out on their own that she could call. I live extremely close by and visit about twice a week sometimes more. Alot of the times I will call her and talk for a little while and say well I am fixing to clean the floors and in a few minutes she will call and I will sound annoyed and she'll say well your not wanting to talk are you? And I will say well I told you I was fixing to clean the floors. So I'm doing that right now. She'll call and ask me everything to what time did I wake up to what did I eat for breakfast, lunch and so on. And then when she runs out of things to say/ask she just hangs on the phone to the point I don't even know if she is still there or not and have to ask are you still there? What do I do?!

20070421193749AAJBueN	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How to improve social skills?	I am a 15 year old guy, who just wants to have fun. By fun I mean, have fun being with the "crowd". The "crowd" to me is just a group of people I see, every where, they're having fun and I observe. But that isn't what I want... I want to be in the conversation, be talked to, and be heard. I want to improve my social skills enough so I can be even more friendly.. and be more talkative rather than being a shy and listening kind of guy. So basically what I'm asking is, how can I improve my social skills.Heres an example. I'm talking to a chick and she's doing most of the talking, but then she stops her topic and then I can't think of anything more to say. I need some questions, sure I can express myself in writeing, but I can't express myself in real life. I need some way of "thinking" like.... a question to ask myself over and over again to keep on making a conversation. Or any other way that can help me express myself and keep on going with a conversation. I thank YOU ALL in advanced.

We all hung out like 7gurls now because of my friends attitude towards the way she treats us many stopped talking to her and formed their own click, In which I seen but at the time of them getting distant forming their click me and my friend were very close.

Because my friend still doesn't see why this is happening to her. She been loosing friends here & there becuz of her attitude & today she lost Me!!! I personally think she'll never learn.

20090227163624AAO2Gx9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I HATE my husband's best friend!?	I am so fed up and just don't know what to do. My husbands best friend is such an asshole! He was the best man at our wedding and I used to think he was okay and just occasionally moody. My husband and I even agreed to let him and his wife be the godparents to our baby on the way. But his moodiness has upgraded to asshole and now I just cannot help but hate him. I have tried, God knows I have tried. I give him the benefit of the doubt when my husband sticks up for him but I am just over it. He treats me like I am something horrible and it has only gotten worse over time. He ignores me, shrugs off my comments like they mean nothing, and just makes me feel like my overall presence around him is ruining his day. Like I said, this has gotten worse over time. In the beginning I would just think he was having a bad day. Also, he always gets my husband into trouble. Whenever they meet at a bar my husband gets WASTED with him and he lets my husband drive home drunk! A real best friend wouldn't do that! I wouldn't let a stranger drive home drunk. So after a couple instances of that happening and us getting into fights over it, I decided I really hate this POS... And now he has been coming over to my house while I am at work and when I get home, he ignores me in my own house! Doesn't even say hi! And then gets up and leaves like I just destroyed some awesome party by coming home. Am I over reacting? I am pregnant but I don't think this is just my emotions anymore. It's been happening for so long and my husband just always defends him. He is at my house now and pat of me wants to stay out till I know he is gone, but the other part of me wants to go home and sit right in the living room and destroy his "party". What do I do? Even his wife who used to be a good friend is kinda being a b**ch now and ignoring my calls and I think it's because of him. Frankly I have had it with both of them and would love nothing more than to just write them out of our lives forever, but he's my husband's best friend so I feel like a compromise should at least be attempted to be made...

And truly my husband is a very sweet man and I know I have made mistakes too. But when we met I was only 16 we dated for a long time and got married when I was 25 and have been married for close to 2 years now.       He is 8 years older than me and even though while we dated I did break things off twice because I felt I needed freedom and to sew some oats well sometimes I still feel like I didn't live enough and not just that but in our first year of marriage I got a call from a man who informed me my husband was emailing his wife dirty things and they were going back and forth he apologized and said nothing happened and I chose to forgive him but there was another time I caught him texting a girl.       I confronted him last night about how these things still bother me (close to a year later) he apologized over and over said he would do anything to make this work with me that I am all he has ever wanted and wants to grow old with me can't believe he was so stupid and will do ANYTHING. But I just don't know what I want I feel I need space but when I try he crys and it breaks my heart to hurt him (even though I have a close guy friend I have contimplated being with and I know that would hurt him more)      WHAT DO I DO?? I am so lost and never thought I would be at this point in my life so you.

I understand that I just said i didn't really like him but i thought that was extremely rude for her to expect me to get over it so quickly.      Afterward I was so shocked i said, *u would really do that to me? friends dont usually slow dance with the guy their friend JUST got over with*. She said *fine fine i will say no*.   After a few minutes I realized that I should let her slow dance with him. Because all my friends know I liked him- it would look REALLY bad. So I was like *fine if you really feel like u HAVE to slow dance with him, go ahead, i shouldnt be stopping you*.      The wierd thing is she is SO full of herself that she thinks my excrush will ask her to dance. On top of EVERYTHING she REALLY likes this other guy.      The wierd thing is she doesnt *try* to make me feel bad. She just thinks that im *over* him so of course it would make sense for her to slow dance with him. Am i being too sensitive???      yeah im not acting mad at school or anything. i was just hurt.      true. but we have a goofy relationship. im not THAT bold. but yes good point that would be awesome!!!      HE NEVER ASKED HER!!!!!!!!

20090227164626AACRrdV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you know what makes you happy if you never have been happy?	I have had moments of true happiness. But only moments.   How can I become happy when all I dream of will be considered acts of selfishness. Either a person is a self loathing, self pitying lazy bum or she is a selfish, mean immature *****...?   I feel that I am neither! I have always lived my life for someone else and it has made me bitter and cynical. I suppose bc I never received what i gave. Meaning encouragement and support when I needed it too.   Now I feel like my life is over, I have nothing left to give, I'm very disappointed in people in my life but at the same time I know I was the one that wanted to help them. They are takers and not givers. Should I have to accept that though...   I haven't been happy in so long that i don't even know what makes me happy anymore! Where do I start to find the steps back to me again?      Anyone who feels like this? and pleeease no rude comments.

20090227163116AAkUP5a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I think of it?	Wondering things.      It's in my blood, being faithful, and giving it all to the man I love. I raised myself the old-fashioned way.      Now I'm young, I need to find a job. I see many girls around moving in with their boyfriend, and I thought about doing the same.   I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years. We are only twenty years old. I want him in my life, no one else ever.   He's a very independent person, shy too. I thought I'd speak with him about future plans, but he told me he was living with the present. I am trying to plan the future because I want to make it be the best for us to always go strong (chosing the place for my job right, living where he wants e.g).   We're fine but I feel like he doesn't really put much effort into making me comfortable, confident about the next years. We're really good for each other though. But I'm scared with myself getting angry about the way he is.

20090227163308AAY0DtZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Tell me what you would do???????????	If you gave your spouse a reason to think you were cheating i.e. had a secretive myspace account where you messaged others inappropriately, showed intent to meet but never seen messages saying you did, and got caught and confessed to it and then your spouse and you agree at this point your going to move forward, leave past in past, and your spouse stated they believed you never met the people nor cheated after you came clean about it all and swaring on your kids, mom, unborn child and then 2 weeks later your spouse states "Hey although we said we would work on it I still have doubts I need you to take that test" would you?       I'm at the point where if my spouse is teling the truth and knows all I want is a test to prove it why not shut me up and take it? On their defense they said I forgave them, said I'd move on, and after making them sware on our children its still not good enough that regardless of a test I will never believe them and this is one of those things I am just gonna have to believe because if not it shows they will never be able to rebuild their trust with me.       I just dont get it if theres nothing to hide why not? My spouse states its a slap in the face and Will Not take it yet I believe my spouse but then when I start thinking about them declining the test it makes me wonder... Please tell me of you were in my spouses situation would you or would you not and just continue to know that this is something that if I had the test would know?????????
20090227162801AAXVwO5	Family & Relationships;Friends	Be who you are. Do you agree with me?	Many people in this world are trying to act cool these days. Sometimes these people have been pressured to do something they don't like, bullying other people and being pressured to make out with some one. And to people who are like that, I say, Just be who you are not to make people like you. Don't do it if you don't like it. Especially if your friend is also being pressured the same way but still doing it. Than she or he is just not strong enough, since you notice, change yourself and defend yourselves. Does any body agree with me on this?    Does anybody think that people should just be yourselves?

We don't know each other too well, but we say hi on campus and so on.      So, I asked her to this dance that was tonight, (she doesn't seem like the dancing person), and though it was rather short notice, she said she'd think about it.      She sent me a text saying that she was kinda busy and she couldn't come because it was so short notice, and I asked her if she was free this weekend and maybe we could do something, she told me it was busy too, and that her weekends are usually busy.       I asked her if she'd let me know when she got free time because I'd love to spend time with her. She replied "Sure, No prob." I said thanks. She didn't reply back. About 20 min later, I replied "Sorry if this is kinda awkward" and she replied, "No, Not at all." And I said "Haha, that's good." She didn't text back.      Did I get rejected nicely? Or do I have a chance?      Another teenage dating question...whoo.

20090227164243AA0EhbH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Prospective employer keep forgetting to call back, what is actually going on here?	I'm in a really wierd job situation right now.  I've been working with this one company I really like for almost a month.  I've had interview after interview with them.  After every interview, I seem to get positive feedback.      However, something strange keeps happening.  For the past 2 weeks about, I keep getting in a situation where they say "we'll call you back [whenever]" and they end up not doing it.  So, what happens is I call them back, and then they said they forgot to call, and that they'll call back [whenever].      Recently, I it happened several times where I saw supposed to have a phone interview with a technical interviewer.  They forgot to call several times, but finally they did, and the interview went well it seems.      But now, I've been waiting on my background check, and again, I keep being told I'll get a call back about it, and it never happens.  I call back, and they forget again, etc.      I know, since I was recently told, that the job has come down to me and someone else.        The question is, what is actually going on here?  Are they intentionally "forgetting" to call me back, or are they just extremely forgetful or busy?  And if they are intentionally doing it, why?  Is "forgetting" to call back a sign that you didn't get the job?

20090227171544AAw9ALH	Family & Relationships;Friends	HELP PLEASE!!!! ADVICE!!!! 10pts!!!!?	Hey, OK so I REALLY need some advice.      Little bg about me and my problem:      Last summer my parents and me moved from S. Cali (where I've been ALL my life) to the middle of the country! UGH!      I knew NO ONE at my school, town, or even in this state!      I've always been real good at making new friends, but I've always had alot to begin with so it's not like starting fresh.      The problem is, I've been on medical leave almost this whole year :-( and I BARELY know anyone. :-(      I've talked to a couple of people, but have been out of school since like Nov. :-(      I don't know if the people who I talked to still like me??? :-(      For instance, I talked to this girl and we seemed like we could be able to be friends, but I emailed her on facebook and she never got back to me.   I don't know if it's cus she forgot about me or just got busy.   My email had a question that was time dependent, and mayb she saw it late and  just decided not to get back??      I don't know what to do!!!!      I was only there for a few days, so I don't have anyone's number.   I can't call anyone or anything.      So I guess my questions are:      Should I email her again just saying hey?   Should I just post on her wall?   Should I ask for her number?      I know it's kinda random, but I'd like to have her over at my house, since no one's been to my new place.      I don't want to be stalkerish, but I'd like to get friends at this school.      So PLEASE ANSWER!!!!!      K, thanks.

He's moving to another state and prior to this i was having doubts about doing the long distance thing and i had been questioning him about everything and everyone - i guess i was a little insecure.... Now that i caught him in a lie however, i just can't see how it would work....he's apologized and promised not to do it again....however, i just don't know if i can let it go..i feel like i cant trust him anymore....should i leave him? or is this not such a big deal to throw a 6 month relationship away for...we were talking about getting married etc....now i dont know......this is the first time this has happened...he's w/me 24/7....

20090225102435AA1paWD	Family & Relationships;Family	Are there people you just can't be around because their personality irritates you so much?	And is that person or one of those people a family member?      Here's the thing:  I love my mother.  She's my mom, she raised me, she took care of me when I was young.  But her personality clashes so much with mine that we get along better when we are not around each other.  She's more the the stereo typical "blonde" type personality and I'm more of the straight forward, think it through type personality.  From the time my own personality started emerging when I was a teen, I have never been able to get along well with my mom.  I can only take her in "small doses" if you will.  But I feel so guilty to feel that way because she IS my mom.  It's not like I don't love her or I don't want to be around her, I just literally can't spend more than an hour around her before she starts to really get under my skin.      Does anyone else have this type of issue?  Should I feel badly?  Is it just me and I'm wrong for feeling this way?  Do you believe there are some people that are just better off taking each other in "small doses" in order to remain civil and kind to each other?
20090225102552AAl1gJm	Family & Relationships;Family	Was what I said Wrong or Hurt-full or did it need to be said ?	My big sister died on Monday she was in the hospital for three weeks dying there are 6 brothers and sisters including my sister that just died.She had three children ages 26,20 and 18 just a little history first she's been sick for awhile everyone knew at some point she would die.Now her children were horrible to her they neglected her and said really awful things to her that nobody should say to their dying mother.Myself my mother and all her siblings visited her in the hospital everyday sometimes she was aware that we were there and then eventually she was unconscious.All of us never saw them visit their mother only maybe twice in three weeks and that's being generous it really think it was only once and by that time my sister was unconscious and didn't get to see them.They wouldn't return the hospital and doctors calls or the family neither nobody could get ahold of them while their mother was dying we left messages and they never once called us or the doctors back.So after talking to one of her doctors I called my nephew and left a message telling him doctors and all of us are trying to reach them and how important it is for them to call us I also said I was told they aren't visiting their mom I said how important it is for them to go daily to see her and how much she needs to see her children not one family member ever once saw them in the hospital and the doctors and nurses never even knew what they looked like was it wrong for me to leave that message on there phone.My nephew was hurt by my message and I feel I did nothing wrong.My sister has been dead since Monday and they still haven't called anyone even their grandma to plan the Funeral services so my mom and brother are doing it this is not normal behaviour even if they are mourning they are really hurting us all.

20070630161342AAVSoPL	Family & Relationships;Friends	Se c'è un amico di troppo?	il rapporto con il mio ragazzo si sta logorando, a forza di litigi ed incomprensioni, credo (ne sono sicura al 99%) che la vera ragione sia la sua amicizia con un tale "X" (per ovvi motivi non scrivo nessun riferimento). X è un bravissimo ragazzo, niente da dire, volnteroso, affidabile e un ottimo amico, ma il suo tipo di rapporto con il mio ragazzo, le sue idee che lo influenzano, ci stanno portando all'esasperazione...ho già provato a parlarliene ma nn sembra voler accettare il problema, e il suo amico X non mi rivolge parola...che fare?

20090225103523AAWFN34	Family & Relationships;Family	My 31-year old deadbeat brother who lives with me threw a fit...?	....and stopped talking to me. It's been 5 days now since he stopped talking.      It started with an argument when he grabbed my foot while I was on the couch & twisting it (he was being stupid) and I screamed my head off to "GET OUT, GET OUT NOW & GO GET A JOB"...I think the neighbors may have heard (I was loud) and I embarrassed him.      Anyway, should I talk to him or should I just quietly start looking for another place and when I'm ready to move tell him we're both going to have to vacate the apt immediately?      I kind of want to get back at him for being such an ingrate (I do pay all of the bills & he does nothing/refuses to work). What would you do to get back at him?      BTW, I know I'm being childish asking this but humor me anyway.      Thanks

Sto troppo male... perche anche volendo dimenticarla... non ci riesco. Penso ai momenti passati assieme... le cose dette... le cose fatte... le emozioni... Insomma tutte cose che, anche se provate a farle con altre ragazze... non mi hanno dato la stessa emozione che mi ha dato lei...   Mi sono innamorato... e adesso l'ho persa...

Ho provato a chiamarla e contattarla...   poi ho provato la tecninca del dimenticare cancellandola da msn... e dalla mente... ma adesso sto sempre qui
20070510193545AAV2I0S	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	La amistad?	La amistad de mi punto de vista la veeria como un amor incondicional,inquebrantable hacia alguien en que pueda compartir muchas cosas,charlas,salidas,encuentros,momento...   Seria como un amor libre y sin ataduras,simplemente porque compartimos momentos muy lindos y aveces de comprencion y otras de apoyo,el echo es solo estar,por eso lo considero un amor libre,nadie nos obliga a nada,estamos porque queremos,porque nos agrada compartir con personas que nos hacen sentir muy comodos.   Que lindo seria ver un amor verdadero convertido en una amistad no??   Sera que tambien la amistad se esta perdiendo por intereces personales que hoy en dia solo se escuchan de traiciones y nada mas,que cosa mas linda tiene la vida el de abrazar a alguien solo por el echo de hacerlo y nada mas,mirarnos reinos sin pensar que no hay nada de por medio,hasta a mi me da bronca escribir esto desfigurando la amistad,porque las reuniones de hoy en dia siempre tienen un bien en comun y no por el echo de compartir,que es lo que les pasa a nuestros corazones,tantas murallas tiene que este tiene que estar saltandolas una por una,y siempre llega cansado a destino.   Se?oras y se?ores disfrutemos de nuestros sentimientos que son muchos,volvamos a ser ni?os aunque sea un ratito por dia y disfrutemos el compartir con los demas,no saben que rico se siente.Gracias

20070616051756AA0GSir	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Perche gli uomini giovani si spaventano ad un appuntamento con una donna più matura?	Ho 45 anni,ben portati, sono bella, e ahimè , sicura. Gli anni, l'esperienza acquisita, le cose della vita mi hanno forgiata e corrazzata. Mi è capitato di arrivare al primo appuntamento con uomini più giovani di me, ma  non poppanti, e vedere che  poco prima del fatidico app.to, trovavano scuse e si volatilizzavano. Prima di ciò mi bombardavano di quesiti su quale ristorante scegliere per la cena,o il  posto dove andare, l'abito da indossare, se fare o non fare sesso.......ma quando mai si preventiva il sesso?La normalità fatta di cose semplici, tipo: ti vengo a prendere, andiamo là vedrai sarà carino, fare poi due passi e .....se sesso sarà, sarà!Oppure mi è capitato di incontrare persone che per sentirsi al passo mi zompavano addosso dopo 5 minuti! Con conclusione di una mia ritirata veloce.   Sicuramente gli uomini più maturi sono anche più sgamati e adeguati alle situazioni, ma credetemi non ce ne sono mica poi tanti.Per giunta tra questi molti sono sposati.

20070428124636AAKjUyy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys out there. When you split from a girl do you feel like this.?	ok my girl friend finished with me in dec 06 we where together for 2 years she always threatened me with a split a few times. Before we met I was a single guy confident but not jerk. Had my own business and spoke my mind. Within those two years I lost my business due spending to much time with her. not her fault mine but you cant have the best of both worlds. She stopped me from speaking my mind and when I did she made it sound if it was stupid girls are like that. so finally she threatened me with a split and I said "What you have turned me in to I would rather that" a month went by and we talked about getting back together but never did down to stubbiness. I think back and think at the beginning we where both so different and miss the person we where and not the people we became but the gutting feeling inside is missing her the way she was and we where. but then you think to end of the relationship and think I’m so happy to be out it. Im confident again and have a business again

Ci scusiamo per l’interruzione dei criceprogrammi, ma abbiamo un scoop dell’ultimo pomeriggio. La notizia riguarda una foto hose’ pubblicata da LA PENTEGANA BUONA.  http://newmedia.funnyjunk.com/pictures/a...  che ha suscitato scandalo e indignazione tra numerosi answerini che gridano addirittura all’incesto!   Infatti, nella foto in questione vengono riprodotti padre e figlia che si danno un bacio sul muso! Le lingue non sono ben visibili ma da numerose fonti attendibili ci sono e sono avvinghiate più che mai! Le zampe sono in posizione “da zozzoni”: si noti bene come la zampa del maschio cerchi la c.d. sporgenza dal petto di lei…   Insomma, sapevamo dell’affetto tra i due…ma non fino a questo punto!   La nostra corrispondente, CRICE ANSWA sta cercando di strappare una smentita da parte dei due.

20090225102634AAx56nx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	So there's this girl in my class i've had a crush on for a while, and I think she likes me, but I'm not sure so I thought I could get some advice here.   I sit in front of her in French class, and every class me and her start talking, and we talk so much tot he point that the teacher sometimes changes the seats of one of us. We also tend to hold hands a lot, link arms and she even pretends that I'm her boyfriend, and it's so convincing that some of our teachers and friends thought we really were going out. We're also really close when it comes to the "touch barrier", I mean, I sometimes hold her from her waist against me, I kiss her in the cheek all then time, I hug her a lot also, and she likes to put her head on my shoulder in class. She also likes to give me these little bites, and when I turned 17, which was like 3 days ago she said she would give me a kiss as a present, and that I could pick the place. And I also happen to know that she thinks I'm the 2nd best looking guy in my class, 'cause she said it to a friend of mine. And I don't think she's being a flirt, because I have never seen her do anything even remotely close to the things we do with other guys.   The reason why I'm confused is that she once told in class to some of us that she only dates guys that are like, 18 or 19 years old (she didn't say it out of the blue, she said it because we were talking about stuff like that), and because I also think she is kinda out of my league ( it's not like I'm ugly, I mean I have blonde hair and blue eyes, but she is just absolutely beautiful). So, what do you think, does she like me?      BTW, I'm 17 and she is gonna be 18 in a month.
20090225102536AAXEwcp	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom is asking to borrow money..AGAIN...what should I do?	My mom makes a little more money than my husband and I do put together.  But, she's always borrowing money from us.  I don't know what her deal is (probably spending it all at the casino). All she talks about is money. My daughter and I went out to eat with her this past weekend and the whole conversation was about her bill collectors. She came to visit the other day; still talking about her bill collectors. I've seen her income and her monthly expenses. She makes enough money to cover her bills and have some left over. She has a boyfriend who drags her down to the casino several times a week; getting back at 4am when she has to be at work at 7am. My husband has told me to stop loaning her money due to one time she borrowed money from us and didn't pay it back and got highly upset because we started constantly asking her for it; never got it. Now, if she ask me to borrow money and I say I don't have it; she'll ask my 18 year old son.  I just got a text message that she wants to borrow $20. My mom is single, owns her home. My 24 year old brother lives with her; he's employed and helps her sometime; not how he should, but he helps. Her take home pay in a week nets about $700-$750 (a week). And, she don't have $20...something is definetely wrong. Don't get me wrong, I love my mom dearly and don't mind helping her out in a time of need, but she can change from mom to dr.jekyll and mr.hyde when money is involved...she's a complete different person. You know  the saying which is sometimes stated wrong. Money is the root of all evil....Money is not the root of all evil.  The love of money is the root of all evil, and people show you who they really are when money is involved..ANYWAY..what do you guys think I should do.

20090225102053AAKR9nV	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do? He is my son's father and we are in love.?	My son's father, my boyfriend has been showing violent tendencies. He is ashamed of his actions (he hasn't done anything too crazy yet or anything) and he is trying to control himself. He says it happens when I disrespect him and make him SO angry. I know that's not an excuse though. Anyways I tried to speak to him about this, because I don't want to be with someone I have to fear, and how am I to know what is going to make him THAT mad to know not to do it again? So I wanted to talk to him about it and be reassured that it won't happen, or that he will TELL me ahead of time that I am starting to cross that path. Violent tendencies are both environmental and genetic, so some people NEED to learn to control themselves. He isn't a monster. We love each other and don't want to be apart, so this isn't as easy as just giving up and moving on. Plus we have a baby together. When I tried talking to him about it, we had been having a great night together, were happy and I figured it was ok to bring it up since we could discuss it calmly since we were in such a good mood...I was wrong. It made him so mad that I would "ruin" the night by "rubbing it in his face" how crappy he is. I didn't even say anything bad...just asked what we will do about it. He lost it. He didn't hurt me all night but we did scream and cry a lot. I was SO afraid of him though. He was screaming so violently and so in my face that I thought he was going to just beat the crap out of me even though he was stopping himself. I kept flinching and he kept getting angrier every time because he was telling me he wasn't going to hurt me and took it like I didn't believe him. I was trying to but I was hysterically scared. This was our worst fight ever. We didn't even sleep together most of the night. I hate this. I refuse to give up on him but I don't know what to do...I can't talk to him about it at all apparently, because he takes it so personally like I am bashing him...and he refuses to take any kind of councilling. He has taken anger management before I guess, and he says he knows how to identify his anger...but that he knows he gets angry when I disrespect him and so I should just know better not to and things would be fine. But I feel that no matter what I do he shouldn't do anything to me, even if it isn't that bad. This isn't an often thing, just sometimes but I don't know if I should just look past it or what. How do we work this out? Leaving him is NOT an option, and either is being abused.

20070602131628AA3hS2N	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a girl be ossessed with me then change her mind?	I am in college. A girl asked me to hang out with her. We got along great and she was very forward and obviously was very into me. She said she recently broke up with her bf. We cuddled and talked on the phone every night and hung out almost every day for weeks and she treated me like a bf. I then told her I liked her and she said she liked me but it wasnt the right time for a relationship cause the summer was coming and we live far apart and it might be possible in the future and she would let me know. After that we still talked almost every day but we didnt hang out as much and she would make excuses why she couldnt hang out with me. She would treat me like her bf one day and then ignore me the next. Its the summer now and weve talked a few times but she sometimes waits a week or more to return a call if at all. Why would she change like this if she was the one that asked me to hang out and does she actually intend to let me know and could a relationship be possible or do i move on?

20090225102713AACrlSx	Family & Relationships;Friends	WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?	This girl i have known for like 10 years said something to me that is really odd??    OK - so we were playing a stupid game and she told me that it took her 2 hours to figure out the game - so when she explained it to me i figured it out in about 15 minutes. So when i asked her if i figured it out she said "No" and when i asked "ok so then what is it" she wouldn't tell me! But the TRUTH was that i had figured it out and i guess she was annoyed. So then she started mocking me saying "oooohhh of COURSE you figured it out ! Who's smarter than you! Your the psychic riiiight??" (maybe misplaced anger?) So i got pissed and laughed at her and told her she was irritatng me - she said "Stop treating me like your boyfriend" (ew?) and i said to her "Stop thinking that i acknowledge you in such high regard" - i felt like she was attacking me !! She WOULDNT let up the fight! - and i dunno why really it was WEIRD and it was annoying that she was mentioning my boyfriend in such a mocking tone...   ok- so all i said to her that i didn't appreciate her nonsense and then (can u believe this?) - she volunteers this info....   "Ok well you wanna know what i can't stand about YOU?" (she sounded desperate too) - "I can't stand the fact that I feel like you use big words so that other people will feel stupid!!" "Yes i feel like you do this!!" (????) And then when we kept arguing she started a sentence like this...."I can't understand why you can't CONCEPT the GRASP of what im saying to you!!" .... WTF???      *BTW - this person is 22 years old and so am I....

The wedding is scheduled for May 30, save the dates have been mailed, vendor deposits put down, dresses bought, non-refundable honeymoon planned etc. I feel really awful about all of this, my parents are losing a lot of money on the arrangements, but I just wasn't ready.       What are the next steps to make this better? My parents are making me call all the vendors and get as much back as possible and return all engagement gifts with a note to everyone. I take responsibility for this, is there anything else that should be done? Is it weird if we still decide to take the trip to Europe together as friends? We ended things amicably and are making other living arrangements, but my mom is telling me that its wrong and she does not approve. Any thoughts?

Per quanto mi riguarda, ci credo molto, anche se non mi ritengo un "credulone"! ciao

20090225102337AAUjR7n	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is this relationship starting to get mentally abusive?	We had move night at a friend's house and I accidentally gave him (my boyfriend) the wrong address but the thing is he was still pretty close to the house well he found it and then I went out to his car and he started yelling at me and I wasn't going to sit there and take it so I got out of the car and he yelled to me "get the **** back into my car!" Yeah in the 18 years my parents have been together my father was NEVER said a cuss work to my mom and my uncle and aunt have been together 25 years and he has never cuss at his wife same with my grandma and grandpa who were together for 52 years he never cuss at his wife either. HE continually turns everything on my and how its my fault I do something to much or I don't do something enough and if I don't answer his texts he'll call me about 6 or 7 times tell I answer and then if I don't he'll text me asking me why I won't answer the phone but he's very mad about it and usually I'm in the shower or talking to my patents its not that I porously ignore him. He always has to know whom I am with, why I am with them, and what we're doing. I mean I've had to defend myself with school and sports and what not but I have never had to defend myself in my personal life not with any of my boyfriends. We were going to break up last night but I think in some situations people should get a second chance but I'm giving him a month or so and if I don't feel happy with my boyfriend of 5 months when he calls or texts then it won't work out. I still should be getting butterflies at this time in the relationship.      The fact that I'm even asking sends me a HUGE red flag and the sad thing is my paretns are starting to worry..      Let me know what you think?

20070613053324AApb1U9	Family & Relationships;Friends	Sono sola. senza amici per colpa del mio carattere chiuso?	ho 15 anni e sto passando da non poco tempo le mie giornate da sola chiusa in casa. Il periodo scolastico cerco di concentrarmi al massimo nello studio, ma l' estate diventa un incubo. Non ho amici. sono molto timida e introversa e questo mio carattere spesso mi fa apparire quella che non sono, ovvero una stupida bambinetta e menefreghista del mondo che la circonda. in realtà so essere ben diversa, molto più aperta e vivace con le persone che davvero mi mettono a mio agio. questa situazione mi sta pesando sempre di più: sto pensando di lasciare la danza che pratico da quando avevo 7 anni per il fatto che nemmeno lì ho amici e non riesco a dimostrare quello che valgo. i miei compagni di classe? non li sopporto e loro faticano a ricordarsi della mia presenza in classe. non posso continuare a vivere nei miei sogni o piangere di notte soffocata nel cuscino senza che nessuno mi possa sentire, senza che nessuno mi possa porgere una mano sulla spalla. Ho bisogno di qualcosa di concreto. aiuto

Dopo una relazione fantastica di un anno ammezzo il mio ragazzo mi ha lasciata. Spiegazione mi ama ancora, come dice lui, ma non sono la donna della sua vita. Il problema  sono i nostri 15 anni di differenza e il fatto che io sia all’inizio di una carriera carica di aspettative, viaggi ed emozioni personali e lui “quasi” al traguardo, o meglio in una fase stanziale dove abitudini ed emozioni sembrano placate. Morale lui non se la sente di affrontare un cammino con me perché, dice, sarebbe un peso per entrambi, abbiamo obiettivi diversi, troppo, aspettative diverse ed energie diversamente distribuite e prima o poi la situazione scoppierebbe. Io penso che lui abbia paura di scommettere sul suo futuro, o meglio sul nostro e che 45 anni non siano la tomba delle emozioni e dei sogni ma possono segnare un nuovo inizio anche per lui. Ma più mi scervello più non ci capisco niente.   Cosa dovrei fare? Dimenticarmi di lui o continuare ad insistere e sperare che cambi idea?

20070705002551AAPBEJg	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	About my friend. I'm not sure what to do. Someone. . .?	He's sweet. He's really sweet. Not to mention cute. But it turns out my best friend (I'm talkin' BEST friend. Never backstabbed me, nothin') likes him too. Lately I've been drifting away from this certain guy to make room for her, but it pains me to do it. But I want the best for her! I do. And the right thing to do is to let her. But I'm being selfish about it and I just can't stand it. I don't want to be so stupid and selfish or anything, I don't, but she's my best friend and I want the best for the both of them. . . but still. . . any suggestions are appreciated. Thank you.

C'è una ragazza che mi piace di brutto, da parecchio tempo, siamo usciti diverse volte assieme a bere qualcosa dopo che finisce di lavorare (lei lavora in un bar).

20090225102312AAxoFhy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I was raped and this guy is still running free. what do i do?	I was raped by this guy that i barely knew He was my friends boyfriend and they had just hooked up. I met him at the rodeo. Anyways, my dad had been drinking one night, and me and my sister called this guy up to go hang out because there was problems at home, so he came and got us. I sat in front, and my sister sat in back.   There was another guy there and his name was mike. Jim (the guy who picked us up) asked me if i wanted to leave the room to go watch T.V. so my sister and mike could get to know each other, so i said yes. But i didn't think he'd shove me into the next room. He started kissing me and i told him to stop. He started sticking his hand down my pants, i told him to stop, he did. But then he clamped his hand over my mouth when i tried to get up and leave the room....he got ontop of me to where i couldn't move, he said if i moved he'd cut me. so i layed there as he pulled my sweat pants off and i tried to scream but he put his hand over my mouth. He said if i screamed he'd beat the ever livin sh*t out of me. he slapped me and told me to shut up. I tried not to cry cuz i was scared he'd hurt me. My sister walked into the bedroom where the sexual assault was happening, but she didn't do anything. She walked back out. i felt like the world was fading away, i heard my sister laughing...and I started crying and he slapped me again, and lying there while he was raping me, i felt helpless. I felt terrible and dirty. He took my virginity. After it was over, i got dressed and fixed my hair and put cover up on my red face...then my sister and I left the house, and all i could do was look at her in confusion cuz she didn't say anything. We went and crashed at my best friend's house and went home the next morning. I never felt more alone.    I finally reported it when jim started e-mailing me and then he confessed it in e-mail and told me it was going to happen again. He said that i need to watch out, and he'd send me pictures of girls that he's assaulted, and he was just really perverted with me. When the cops showed up..... My sister sat right there and told the cops infront of me that she didn't know what i was talking about, and when i confront her alone, she admits that she don't want no part of it. Because of that, my parents don't believe me either. I was alone, and i had no one to talk to... I felt suicidal and angry for a while. Because of my sister, he is free. Free to hurt me again. I need help, and the cops won't do anything, and i feel so worthless. I dont know what to do. I feel lost. and I feel so much hate towards my sister. HELP!

20090225102637AAvObzU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls is she really just busy?	Ive known this girl over a year... we've been dating for 2 months and things were going great.  We had a nice V-day weekend together, but ever since then we haven't communicated as much and it just feels like she's distant.  Despite this, around the middle of last week I asked her if she was doing okay with regards to me.  She said she liked the way things are going and she's doing good, and shes just busy but stuff just feels differently.        She texted me monday and said she wants to hang out this week.  We're going to hang out Friday, but I'm afraid she's going to break things off with me or something.  I dont want to ask her or bug her about it because I don't want to seem too needy.  Does it seem like she might want to get together to tell me she's lost interest in me?  How would someone lose interest when nothings happened really since the last time I saw her?  Does it seem like she's lost interest or is she probably just busy?

Ever since we were toddlers, we ahve always been inseperable!   We do everything together and tell each other everything. If i wont tell her a secret it means NO one else will know!   But im 15 and she is 13, and it seems like ever since i hit my teenage years first, her parents have treated me different and it seemed like they are trying to keep her away from me! I soon found out that i was right. My mom told me that her parents caught her with boys and blamed me for it!! She wasnt doing anything but talking to them but now im forbidden from seeing her because supposedly im a "bad influence". i cant let go of our friendship, i am so lost without her and i dont think i can go on long like this. Bottom line...Do i personally confront her parents? Do i prove that im a good girl? Please help me!!! They really misjudged me.

I saw this guy in my canteen at University that came over to me and asked me if I would like to meet him for a drink and some lunch.I agreed because he was quite goog looking but mainly because a good friend had arlier told me that he was a really good guy.   I arrived for the date and he was a perfect gentleman.He kept smiling at me and sat with his hand on my half of the table.He kept asking me if I wanted another drink (non alchoholic!)eventhough he was paying and has hardly any money.Then after we had finished he asked me if I would like to meet him again. He seemed very worried that I would think he was weird or something and he kept on getting embarrased and asking if he was saying the right thing.His texts are very negative.   I just don't know if he likes me as a friend or wants me as a gf.He has mainly female friends.He seems like a really decent guy.I really like him.

20071024224215AAwR9nu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this guy?	I met this really cool guy at a Starbucks. He was really fun to talk to and he really liked my mustang (i made fun of his girly car) and we sorta hit it off really well. He gave me his email and AIM so we started to talk non stop online. When i asked him what he thought of me he said i was really cute and he wanted to go on a real date. So we met up at the beach and hung out for awhile, but it got cut short. Before we parted ways he gave me a really big hug and said to email him. So I did...and again...and again...he never answered. So i im'd him too since he goes invisible a lot on AIM, but no reply. He has been offline for almost 2 weeks since our first date...do you think he is uninterested now or what? I'm so confused and I really liked this guy too, and apparently he really liked me too but I dont know whats going on
20071024235543AArGbV3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Best Friend Is the Only Person I Love?	I met a guy on a game 3 years ago, we talked a lot and he dissappeared. He was gone for a year and i suddenly got a message from him and it sparked up our old conversations. We use to talk for hours to all night long. I told him once that it felt like i loved him, and he was a bit freaked out by it. Then the next day over vent (a microphone service we used to talk) he said "I love you too". It took me like a week to get the courage to actually say it to him then type it. So i went up north to kentucky (he lives in Indiana) and we met for the first time. After that we had each others number and talked even more. But now since college has started for both of us we dont talk much. We know we could never have a real relationship b/c of the distance, but it hurts so bad to think that. I dunno what to do b/c anytime i wanna meet a new guy i just think of him. He is still always on my mind. Im so confused and thinking of how we cant work makes me so depressed all time :(

20071028121319AAXRGW8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My best friend rejected me. How should I react?	I told my best friend that I loved her. She rejected me, gently, but the result is the same. Over time, I realized that we were soul mates, and even on the physical level, she told me many times that she thought I was so handsome (OK, I don't mean to sound vain...that's what she said...). But after her rejection, I came to the conclusion that despite our past relationship, I cannot have contacts with her any longer, especially that I don't ever want to hear about her relationship problems with other guys. Should I just exit out of her life without saying anything else? If I do that, she will be left out on her own with no more real intimate friend and confidante...But honestly, I don't care if she is hurt, because I am hurt too and I just want her to suffer. I know it's not good to think that way, but hey, I am human too! Please serious advice only...unless its really funny and it cheers me up!

20071126195251AAJlL1w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like my bestfriend, but does he like me back? he is very shy NEED ANSWERS PLEASE :)?	He and I have been really good friends since junior year, and now we are freshmans in diff. colleges. He is very shy, and had only had one "gf". They never really went out, but people knew they liked each other. He treats me how treated her but you can tell he liked her, unlike my case. But he couldn't talk to her the way he talked to me. Hhe said he couln't talk to others the way he talks with me. Overall, he is sweet and he always makes sure i'm home safe after a hang out (group/single), opens the door, and is an all around gentleman. (he is not like that with his/our other girl friends) Although, he teases me a lot when we are hanging out in our big group of friends. I feel like he doesn't want people to know how he is sweet to me. He acts different w/ me when we are by ourselves. I know he knows I like him, but he is not yucked by it, and he doesn't push me away. We are still the "good friends" (although now when he comes up, he is a lot sweeter) What is going on in his head?
20071126235435AAYlyqP	Family & Relationships;Family	Bonjour à tous! j'ai besoin de vos précieux avis sur un fait.Voilà,ca fait 8 ans que je sort avec mon fiancé,	qui est plutot du genre gentil, responsable et tous ce dont je crois qu'une femme peut revé.Mais Depuis 8ans je ne sais vraiment pas pourquoi mais une voix de plus en plus forte au fond de moi me convaint de ce que cet homme n'est pas l'homme de ma vie et sans le vouloir j'ai développée une certaine réserve histoire de ne pas trop souffrir le jour ou il partira.On a un fils de 4ans ensemble!j'ai 27ans et je me demande maintenant s'il ne faut pas régler ce problème une fois pour toute en mettant fin à tout,ou en me débarrassant de cette voix.J'avoue que quand je considère que je n'ai pas grande chose à lui reprocher et en plus l'enfant qu'on a,et ma nièce de 1an et demi qu'on a adopté je ne sais plus quoi faire.Mais cette voix est si forte et meme que parfois j'ai l'impression qu'une autre vie m'attends et que je perds mon temps.Ca vous arrivent? comment faites vous,et quels sont vos avis.j'en peux vraiment plus et je sais qu'il le sent et qu'il en souffre.

I have lots of friends, there is girls and boys in my crew, I act natural to them both, girl and boys, I act the same to them.      I am funny to them, but I have noticed, everytime we meet a new person into our group, and begins hanging out with us daily, and i know she likes me, friends even tell me, im not me.      Im not funny anymore, Im kinda like numb or whatever.   I mostly hang out with this girl, she even told me im funny, we make jokes, laugh none stop.      But when this new girl that i heard that likes me, even when she told me, im not funny anymore .. And this isnt the first time I get into this situation.      I can't pretend she is someone else, Ive tried that, didnt help.   Any advice?

20071130175915AArkfFo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	On the subject of "dating" women with children?	I am single, and have been going on many dates with different women. Some I meet online, and some are friends of friends, or people I meet when I am out.      I have dated women with kids.My question is, that when i go out with the single mothers I automatically exclude them from being a possible "candidate" to be "The One". It is just not what i am looking for, and I go in with the intention of being friends, nothing more.      The problem is, single Mom's do seem to want serious relationships more...I am honest, up front with them. Should I quit dating women with kids? I mean I have had great company with them, and it's always good to meet new people. What is your opinion on this, and your opinion on dating with "friend only" intentions.

20071201194051AA9wO36	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex boyfriend messaged me.  What should I say?	Jake was my high school sweetheart.  We dated a total of three years with a break one summer where we wanted to "see other people".        After a few months of not talking to Jake, I started dating another boy.  This lasted a month until Jake sent me an email asking me what I was up to.  I broke up with my new boyfriend.  Within two weeks, Jake and I were dating again.        We ended up breaking up for college.  I knew it was for the best, but I thought about him all the time.  I guess I've always thought we would get back together.  I've been in college for a year and a half and I haven't met anyone I could feel the way I felt about Jake.      Yesterday, he messaged me after nearly a year.  We've had a few conversations, but it's always me initiating them and then giving up.  All he said was that he was wondering what I was up to and that we hadn't talked in a long time.  It was friendly, but because this is so out-of-character for him, I don't know how to take it.      What should I reply to him?

20071202075604AAMpncv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he really like me?	i was meeting up one of my friends.. and he brought his friend.. the minute i saw him.. he seemed like the perfect "target" to pick on. i went for it and made fun of him the whole night. two weeks later.. i saw him again.. i went at it again. i had no intentions of hitting on him or getting him to like me. that nite, we ended up getting pretty drunk and made out. a few nights later.. i found out that he has a gf..it started bothering me. from then on i started crushing on him. we just kept on hanging out and talked on the phone/text. one day i got drunk and asked him to break up with his gf and he said he would but couldnt now because she was sick. that he wants to at least see her get better.. he said they had talked about breakin up before, but then she got sick so they just kinda dropped the subject..he told me he likes me too.. i just want to know whether i should really wait for him.. or if he is just playing games. ive never felt like this before..

Como duele cuando un amor se aleja   Te entregue lo mejor de mi, pero te fuiste con ella   Te di todo mi amor y mi ilusion que no apreciaste   Lograste conquistar mi corazon y despues lo rechazaste      En donde quedo todo lo que te di?   Mis besos y caricias que contigo comparti   En donde quedo lo que yo te ofreci?   El amor que fingias darme, eso tambien perdi      Dime si ella te besa como yo lo hacia   Dime si con ella sientes lo que conmigo sentias   Ella no sabe lo mucho que te ame   Pero tu si sabes que casi te adore      Yo se que le amas, de eso estoy segura   Pero lo que hubo entre tu y yo, tambien se no se ira nunca   Que dolor verte con ella y saber la haces feliz   Saber que a ella le das lo que no obtuve de ti   No mientas, yo se que aun me deseas   Y se que al estar con ella, en mis caricias piensas      Se que ya te fuiste y me duele el corazon   Me duele verte entregarle a ella todo tu amor   Es un dolor, un fuerte sentimiento.....

20071227143202AANSB0D	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think?  Has this ever happened to you?	I'm rather strange.  I'm not hoping for any answers b/c this isn't really a question.  Rather long, just wanted to get it off my chest.      I'm happy w/ my boyfriend of almost 2 yrs, now out of the blue I'm thinking, have I ever liked anyone?  I know I should focus on my 1st yr in Uni, but, I think I liked my brotherly friend before he became more of a brother to me.  Should I tell him now that I think I've liked him before?  It would be rather random, but I am known by just about every1...for my randomness.  I love being w/ my boyfriend, I don't want any regrets, and I'm rather weird b/c...I think my now brotherly friend liked me before as well, but now I've just become too weird for him to deal w/.  I've known him the longest out of all my friends b/c we went to Middle School together.  He's the typical All-American boyscout bible studies military minded kinda guy, I'm just thinking that I might've liked him b/c I wanted to be him or wanted to be like him? I think I just need a slap.
