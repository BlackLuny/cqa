20070425203227AAItsyk	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Should I tell my best friend that I'm gay?	I'm a 24 year-old guy, and just recently admitted to myself that I'm gay. But I'm not sure if I should tell my best friend of 9 years, and if I should, how?      He's very homophobic. Very. We used take summer classes together in the city, and he would always drive down. From campus to the highway, you have to go through the city's gay district. He would always go around the district--a longer route. That's how homophobic he is.      Now, I'm not sexually attracted to him, though I do find him very cute. We've been best friends for a long time, and I would never do anything to ruin that. So I'm not sure if I should tell him or not.      What should I do?

It has been siad that women enjoy hugging and touching more than genital sex, whereas men have little interest in the "preliminaries," preferring to "get down to the real thing."

20070426211521AAI2B1Z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are spiritual/psychic cleansings real?	i recently went to a psychic and he read my cards.  it was alarmingly similar to my life and things that are going on in it right now.      he told me that i needed a cleaning because my auras were multi-colored and if you were one with yourself, your aura would be one color.      everything that he told me sounded legit.  he was really cool and spent quite some time with me answering all of my questions.         but i am just wondering if this is real?  should i really spend some spare change to have my spirit cleansed?  is this real?  how can you tell the difference?      your help is appreciated.   thank you
20070427104216AAx7KWb	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	I need some help with this essay question about poems?	analyse how plath and pugh (writers of each poem) depict 'how it looks from here' in the poems 'Mirror' and 'Sometimes'      i dont know where to start or what type of things to write. im not saying write the essay out for me, i just need some pointers.      if u want a look at the poems, here....      SOMETIMES      Sometimes things don't go, after all,   from bad to worse. Some years, muscadel   faces down frost; green thrives; the crops don't fail.   Sometimes a man aims high, and all goes well.      A people sometimes will step back from war,   elect an honest man, decide they care   enough, that they can't leave some stranger poor.   Some men become what they were born for.      Sometimes our best intentions do not go   amiss; sometimes we do as we meant to.   The sun will sometimes melt a field of sorrow   that seemed hard frozen; may it happen for you.      Mirror   I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.   Whatever I see I swallow immediately   Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.   I am not cruel, only truthful ?   The eye of a little god, four-cornered.   Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.   It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long   I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.   Faces and darkness separate us over and over.      Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,   Searching my reaches for what she really is.   Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.   I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.   She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.   I am important to her. She comes and goes.   Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.   In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman   Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.

20090203131231AA5WTFN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Some questions for true theists?	Humans learn from mistakes and history. I don’t understand why this is so hard. As long as you can find a good reason for why something is wrong, then it makes sense; we can determine through our own point of view why something is wrong.      Do you think it is correct to punish a homosexual by death?   Or do you think it is wrong to punish a homosexual by means of death?      I hear that God is the dictator or standard giver, yet you have many believers that think homosexuals should be killed and it still happens in today’s societies. And the ones that are killing the gays believe they are living by God’s standard or doing what god wants. You keep bringing up Hitler and stuff, but there is a lot of evidence that Hitler did believe in the supernatural, but preferred to go with the DARK side of supernaturalism. There you go.      God is supposedly intelligent. Humans have intelligence. Please explain to me what God has that humans don’t in relation to reasoning or understanding WHY something is wrong.      God dictating morality is no different than a Hitler or a Mother Teresa dictating morality. All three are subjective.      We get our morals through reasoning and what we think we would not like done to us as individuals (Golden Rule).
20090203131224AAJuKH2	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Should i just leave black men alone? All they do is treat me wrong and hurt me?	I have only ever dated or been intimate with black men.      And every single one of them has been a disappointment,    and in my opinion treated me very poorly or disrespectfully   no matter how hard i tried to treat them with consideration   and thoughtfulness. I always give my all in relationships.      They have always either been liars, cheaters, "players",   users, etc.       I have been seeing a man right now for 4 months    and when i called him today to ask if he wanted to see a movie   next week he said "maybe" and when i asked him   if there was a problem he told me that he is   "still single" and that he still sees other women.      It came as a shock to me that he is still seeing   other people because he never mentioned that   to me before and I have not been seeing any other men.   Plus, i thought it was rude and uncalled for that he    would rub that in my face.       I have been hurt and mislead by black men so many   times when i don't even HAVE to date them, many times   men of other backgrounds who are attractive are interested   in me, but i have never dated or been intimate with someone   non-black.      I know it's not race. But, too many black men just don't know    how to be respectful of other people's feelings.      I'm tired of being dogged when i know i'm a good person   and don't deserve this. Most girls i see of other races   have good boyfriends and men in their life.

This is not meant to offend anyone, as I'm pretty small myself, but I often hear men say things like "I wouldn't date a woman who was bigger/taller/larger than me."

In 1925 there was a religious census taken that showed out of a population of sixty-five million, forty million belonged to the Protestant Church.8 No   A Nazi, Hans Kerri, created for himself a Reich church ministry in 1933which carried with it the task of keeping the churches of Germany in line.      Hitler used the goal of unifying the twenty-eight branches of Protestantism to assert his influence over a large proportion of the German people. An official blessing by Protestant pastors across Germany on Easter Sunday, 16 April 1933, ensured the Protestant support of Nazism:   A state that once again rules in God's name can count not only on our applause but also on enthusiastic and active cooperation from the church. With joy and thanks we see how this new state rejects blasphemy, attacks immorality, promotes discipline and order with a firm hand, demands awe before God, works to keep marriage sacred and our youth spiritually instructed, brings honour back to fathers of families, ensures that love of people and fatherland is no longer mocked, but burns in a thousand hearts . . . We can only plead with our fellow worshippers to do all they can to help these new productive forces in our land reach a complete and unimpeded victory.       In Munich, Protestant pastors celebrated Hitler's birthday with the passing of the collection plate and, with swastikas stitched to their robes, they marched in the 1933 May Day Parade for National Labour.

20090203132456AAlP65Y	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	"If you don't have anything in your mind, throw it out."?	What does this koan mean: "If you don't have anything in your mind, throw it out." ?    We've just started learning about Koans and Meditation in my Zen and Emerson class and were assigned different koans to kind of 'decode' what they mean. Mine is: "If you don't have anything in your mind, throw it out."   I need to write about at least 20 different interpretations on what others think this koan means, so please respond and help me out.   Thanks so much!

20070515144945AAVyqRZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians only please.  John 1:9 says Jesus enlighens every man that comes into the world. Do you think . . .	Do you think this means is accomplished through the "great commission" (go out into all the world and preach the gospel)     or   Do you think it's something that occurs supernaturally.  That the Spirit of God illuminates someone's mind through nature, or preaching, or just by special revelation in order to give every man (&woman) a balanced perspective at least once in their life to make a willful decision to either accept or reject the heavenly gift of God?      Here's the verse:      John 1:9   That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.   KJV

Además, ?por qué éstos géneros varían de una lengua a otra?

20090203132644AAqFePY	Society & Culture;Languages	Hello! How would you say THIS in Spanish....! Thankssss!?	He is a darling boy. He is always willing to try. His lack of organization is a hindrance for him. You should be proud of his efforts. It is difficult for him to learn and understand the meaning of new words. His reading comprehension is also very weak. It appears he worries about how other people are behaving more than he should. He did not hand in 3 reading charts which lowered his grade a little. His grades vary a lot. He earned lower grades the first half of the quarter. We are pleased that he is feeling more comfortable in school and hasn't needed to go to the office lately. I am very lucky to have her in my class. She is a strong role model for her peers. Keep it up!

20070513210021AAI26Cj	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Important. Gay Rights? Agree?	I am straight, and I have no problem with gay people. I think they should be able to get married. Why not?? There is really not a good reason. It isn't hurting anyone else. In a country where we are supposed to be free. I don't understand how this is still an issue. It should be their right. It shouldn't be about what everyone else's personal opinion is on the subject. It comes down to human rights. No one should be allowed to tell you who you can love. Everyone should have the right to be able to marry. I think it is horrible that personal opinions dictate if this is right or not. There are no FACTS about anything relevant that should keep them from being married. The same people who have the right to believe in the religion of THEIR choice, and practice it, are the very ones telling other people what they are doing is wrong in the eyes of their religion. We are supposed to be able to be free to have our own beliefs on what is right and wrong. Just like they are allowed to shove their bull sh** down our throats. People need to get over it and find something better to do with their lives then worry about what everyone else is doing with theirs. Just because you are unhappy people doesn't give you the right to make other people unhappy. Let everyone be free to enjoy their lives.

El subastador Ferry Heij contó que esta mortificada mujer le había llamado para decirle que quería vender el horno.      Le explicó que su gato se había empapado después de estar bajo la lluvia y ella pensó que la mejor manera de secarlo era meterlo en el microondas.      Metió el gato, puso el temporizador en “descongelar” y lo encendió.      La anciana le contó al se?or Heij que el pelo del gato se puso inmediatamente de punta y diez segundos después explotó.      El vendedor limpió los pelos del horno y lo vendió por 150 rands      ? Verdad o fábula ?

20070812231913AALbYeT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If you want Creationism or intellegent Design taught in schools. Do you want Science teachers teaching it? or?	Intellegent Design -- How would they teach that Aleins or Gods or a God came down to earth and started the human race when their is no science to back up these ideas. Should this be a philosophy class. Should Science teachers be expected to explain this without even a hypothisis let alone a scientific theory.

20070625223320AA350hS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Chrsitians accept Jesus on faith, yet when you tell them there's no proof of Jesus, they say yes there is?	So which is it Christians? If there is any shred of evidence that Jesus actually lived, then you aren't taking it on faith.      But that is not something you need to worry about, since not a single historian who lived at the time of Christ mentions him. Even the new testament was written after he supposedly lived.

20081122165216AAWAf3G	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Please, I need someone's help. I just confessed my love to the girl I like...?	I went over to her house today and I wasn't able to tell her anything. Her family was all over her...I came out of her house wanting to cry because I love her. I love her and I can't help it. And I was so angry that I sent her this.   "(Insert her name) from what I've seen, you're a pretty open-minded person. So, please, all I ask is that you don't hate me after you read this. If you don't want to talk or "bug" me in the library anymore, I get it. But please don't hate me.    I'm with (boyfriend's name), not because I like him. But because I had to be stupid and try and prove something to myself that wasn't true. I thought I could like him if I tried. I told myself that maybe just maybe I could be normal if I liked a guy. The truth is, I can't. Not because he's a bad guy, but because I can't like guys. I'm gay.    Now, I don't think you'd hate me because of that. I think you might hate me because of what I'm about to say...(Insert her name), I like you. A lot. As more than a friend. I can't help it. I hate myself because not only because I know you can't like me that way, but because you're my friend's younger sister and it's just not appropriate.    Why am I telling you this? Because I'm sick of being a coward. I'm sick of wishing for something I can't have. The day I told you that you deserved someone better than that guy at Homecoming, I meant it. You deserve someone so amazing. That's how special you are. And whoever "Poptart" (The guy you like) is, he's pretty stupid if he doesn't feel the same way about you. Heck, any guy would be stupid not to realize how special you really are.    I just hope we can remain friends. (Insert her name), this was killing me in a way you can't know. It hurts so much to look into someone's eyes that you care about so deeply and know that they can't feel the same way. I'm just grateful that I had the opportunity to have your friendship, whoever brief it might be.   So yeah, I think I've babbled enough. I hope you have a great weekend.

20081010074133AAqZ9Aq	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Can you tell me if Margo was being sarcastic with her response here or not?	I am having a hard time digesting her response to a woman who made a very poor choice in her life.       Thank you:      "DEAR MARGO: Three years ago I started a condoned affair with another man. This affair changed rapidly over five months from a "fling" to an all-out love affair that only ended when he asked me to leave my husband. I had been married less than a year when this happened and was scared by the thought that I actually wanted to do it. I cut my ties with him and told my husband that I had done so. Three weeks later we discovered I was pregnant. I had slept with both men at this time and both men knew about each other. After I told my husband, I called the other guy and swore up and down that the child was not his and I was happy to be pregnant by my husband. We all let it drop at that. However, two years later I have a beautiful baby boy who looks nothing like my husband and has the personality of the other man. In my heart I am convinced he is not my husband's son. The other man is currently serving a tour in Iraq. Do I tell him about his son? I wish there was someway I could get a paternity test, but I think it's best to let sleeping dogs lie, though I worry that the other guy deserves to know. Am I wrong to deny him the chance to be a dad?       --- HOLDING BACK          DEAR HOLD: What is to be gained by revisiting your earlier decision to stay in your marriage and tell the other man the child was your husband's? Your little boy has a dad, and it would turn your life upside down to tell this man he has a son. Nothing good would come of it ... but you might wind up with a custody suit or a divorce. Just hope your husband has not picked up on the child's resemblance to what's-his-name. Should this happen at some time in the future, bone up on recessive genes and suddenly remember your Uncle Charles who looked quite a bit like your son.          --- MARGO, PRUDENTLY "         link:       http://news.yahoo.com/s/dear_margo/20081...

20081022092820AAxQJWz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The Third Eye and its Risks?	I do believe most people may view me as a mentally unstable imbecile, who has lost control of his thoughts. If that's the case, save your criticisms, I have no need for them. I believe I've opened my metaphoric "third eye" at some point throughout my eighteen years. I don't know if it was the several bangs to the head, all the mushrooms,or  all the deep, never-ending thought that I often envelop myself in, but  the problem is that I can't seem the leave this frame of mind. It's gotten to the point where I often cant expose my thoughts around others because they are completely unorganizable. The only way I can explain it is that it's like being in a constant state of meditation. Thinking of nothing and everything at once, being connected to all things around you. Its as if I can't organize my thoughts because there's not enough and too much at the same time. When I really delve into it, its as if I can see the pure, bare energy that our very thoughts are made of. Its as if I can hold the vastness of the universe in the palm  of my hand and understand how it works. But its too much to bare, and its something that could never truly be explained. Its like knowing something so great, but being unable to define it for fear of sounding like a crazy person. I've come to realize that the term "ignorance is bliss" is quite true, as well as "you can't handle the truth". Maybe I didn't take the necessary precautions on the road to opening my psyche. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks to those who don't turn this into a, "let's talk smack about the crazy guy", discussion.

I surrendered to God. I am a 33 year old man who was stubborn and hard headed. I never gave in to anything or anyone. Until now. Soon after my prayers, I litterally felt as if I had just gotten out of a 33 year prison sentence. The first thing I did was grabbed piece of apple pie and sat on the soffa. Then I did something that I hadn't done in several years. I DIDN"T turn on the television!! I had no desire. I then went outside.  I smelled the fresh cold air for the first time. I listened to the birds sign for the first time in years. As I drove to work, I did not even turn on my radio. I just drove and listened to silence. This was not my normal routine. Again I began to cry uncontrollably. So I pulled over, went to a gas station to get a cup of coffee. Suddenly I realized what was happening. The Holy Spirit had entered my heart!! PRAISE GOD!! However, at this point I grew concerned..

20071013115209AAce4wT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	?Cuándo Comenzará el "Tiempo del Fin"?	En el libro de Daniel vemos varias profecías que describen en distinto grado de detalle la cronología del Tiempo del Fin. Sin embargo, el propio profeta no entiende a qué eventos históricos se está refiriendo esta cronología. En su visión Daniel protesta al ángel que se le aparece:       Yo oí, pero no entendí. Dije entonces: 'Soberano mío, ?cuál será el fin de estas cosas?' (Dan 12,8)      El ángel explica a Daniel que el significado de las visiones permanecerá indescifrable hasta el momento en que ocurran los propios eventos del Tiempo del Fin:       él respondió: 'Anda, Daniel, pues estas palabras están cerradas y selladas hasta el tiempo del fin'. (Dan 12,9)       Aunque el a?o exacto del Tiempo del Fin no puede deducirse del Libro de Daniel, no hay nada oculto en la Biblia Hebrea en cuanto a cuando tendrá lugar el Tiempo del Fin. De hecho, la fijación del Tiempo del Fin está expresamente omitido en la Torah. En Dt 28-30 Elohim expone las condiciones de su alianza con Israel: Si Israel guarda la alianza, ellos serán benditos con abundancia y paz pero si violan la alianza serán castigados severamente con una maldición. En Dt 29,25-27 se advierte al pueblo de Israel que si continúa pecando la última maldición será el destierro de la Tierra de Israel. Deut 30,1ff. después describe la redención final:      "Sucederá que cuando hayan venido sobre ti todas estas cosas, la bendición y la maldición que he puesto delante de ti, te arrepientas en medio de todas las naciones adonde te haya arrojado YHWH, tu Elohim, te conviertas a YHWH, tu Elohim, y obedezcas a su voz conforme a todo lo que yo te mando hoy, tú y tus hijos, con todo tu corazón y con toda tu alma, entonces YHWH hará volver a tus cautivos, tendrá misericordia de ti y volverá a recogerte de entre todos los pueblos adonde te haya esparcido YHWH, tu Elohim. Aunque tus desterrados estén en las partes más lejanas que hay debajo del cielo, de allí te recogerá YHWH, tu Elohim, y de allá te tomará. YHWH, tu Elohim, te hará volver a la tierra que heredaron tus padres, y será tuya; te hará bien y te multiplicará más que a tus padres. Y circuncidará YHWH, tu Elohim, tu corazón, y el corazón de tu descendencia, para que ames a YHWH, tu Elohim, con todo tu corazón y con toda tu alma, a fin de que vivas".       Vemos a partir del pasaje anterior de Deuteronomio que después de que Israel se arrepienta YHWH retornará de su destierro a Israel (?una segunda vez!) y pondrá su convenio en los corazones del pueblo. Volviendo a Jeremías 31,32 vemos que el tiempo del fin es descrito como un periodo en que el convenio de YHWH es escrito en los corazones del pueblo:      "Pero esta es la alianza que haré con la casa de Israel después de aquellos días, dice YHWH: Pondré mi ley en su mente y la escribiré en su corazón; yo seré su Elohim y ellos serán mi pueblo".       El Tiempo del Fin de Jeremías y la Redención de Deut 30 es una sola cosa, un mismo evento. En Deut 4,30 se nos dice explícitamente que al Tiempo del Fin se llegará tras el arrepentimiento de Israel:       " ... en los últimos días te volverás a YHWH, tu Elohim, y oirás su voz... no se olvidará de la alianza que juró a tus padres..." (véalo en un contexto más amplio en Deut 4,25-31 a partir del cual resulta claro que esto se refiere a la misma exacta sucesión de eventos de Deut 30,1 y sig.).       Por tanto, no hay nada oculto en cuanto a cuando tendrá lugar el Tiempo del Fin. Como puede ser manifiesto en Deut 4 y 30, en cuanto Israel se arrepienta y vuelva a YHWH, el destierro acabará y comenzará el periodo de la alianza renovada. Con la gran mayoría del Pueblo de Israel todavía en el destierro, y los que están en la Tierra de Israel siguiendo el camino de la iniquidad, este tiempo parece lejano. Sólo podemos orar para que el Pueblo de Israel se arrepienta y cumpla su deber de ser una guía para las naciones. Hasta ese día es el deber de todo ser humano, de Israel y de las Naciones inclusive, guardar los mandamientos de YHWH expresados en su santa Torah para que el tiempo se?alado llegue cuando:      "No ense?ará más ninguno a su prójimo, ni ninguno a su hermano, diciendo: 'Conoce a YHWH', porque todos me conocerán, desde el más peque?o de ellos hasta el más grande, dice YHWH". (JER 31,33 [RVA 31,34])

Su alabanza subsiste para siempre.      -Salmo 11:10 Traducción del Nuevo Mundo      Parecería que en este pasaje hay una discrepancia de número entre “el temor de YHWH”, que es singular, y “los ponen por obra”, que es plural. ?A qué se refiere ese “los” (o “aquéllos”) en plural, si el objeto directo parece ser “el temor de YHWH” en singular? ?Hay en realidad una discrepancia de número?
20071018055324AAO1HTR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	El concepto bíblico del mundo segun los textos hebreos!?	Versículo Central:    "Porque tanto amó YHWH al mundo que dio a su Hijo unigénito, para que todo el que crea en él no se pierda sino que tenga vida eterna. Pues Elohim no envió a su Hijo al mundo para condenar al mundo sino para que el mundo se salve por medio de él."    --Juan 3:16,17 (Versión Israelita)   Introducción   En la mayor parte de los idiomas la palabra "mundo" tiene varios significados distintos. En el hebreo bíblico la palabra que se traduce como "mundo" es olám. Pero olam significa "siglo," "era," "antiguo," "eterno," y también "mundo." En el hebreo moderno se usa además con el sentido de "universo."        En los textos griegos las palabras que más a menudo se traducen como "mundo" son kósmos y aión. Kósmos se refiere mayormente al sistema mundial, mientras que aión se aplica principalmente al concepto de siglo o era.    La palabra "mundo" en las Escrituras tiene diversos significados según el contexto en el que se use. Nos agregas tu opinion?
20070927064337AAc2btU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Roma asoma…el vaticano actual. Comentarios biográficos para tenerSE en cuenta…?	…con el nombre de Benedicto XVI asumió el 19 de abril del 2005 el cardenal alemán de 78 a?os Josef Ratzinger, quien había estado por décadas a la cabeza de la Congregación de la Doctrina de la Fe - sucesora de la Inquisición -. Ratzinger, que había sido mano derecha de Juan Pablo II, había declarado que la doctrina de la Iglesia Católica debía ser considerada "definitiva". Un día antes de ser elegido, en la tradicional misa "Pro eligendo Romano Pontifice", el entonces cardenal había declarado que "la barca de la fe de muchos cristianos ha sido agitada (...), llevada de un extremo al otro, del marxismo al liberalismo, hasta el libertinaje, del colectivismo al individualismo radical, del ateísmo a un vago misticismo religioso, del agnosticismo al sincretismo" lo que generaba " una dictadura del relativismo, que no reconoce nada que sea definitivo y que deja como última medida sólo al propio yo y a sus deseos". Se estimaba que Benedicto XVI habría de defender la inmutabilidad doctrinaria del catolicismo en materia de teología, organización eclesiástica, derechos de las mujeres, sexualidad y salud reproductiva. Uno de los principales colaboradores de Ratzinger, el cardenal Camillo Ruini, había se?alado poco antes que la cultura europea actual "es la contradicción más radical del cristianismo y de las tradiciones religiosas y morales de toda la humanidad". La figura y acción de Ratzinger, quien había perseguido y silenciado disidentes -sobre todo la prédica de religiosos y teólogos calificadas como "progresistas"- era considerado "rígido" y muy impopular entre vastos sectores de la Iglesia. ?Qué me ladras Pascual?

II Reyes 2:23-24    23 De allí subió a Betel. Iba subiendo por el camino, cuando unos ni?os peque?os salieron de la ciudad y se burlaban de él diciendo: ??Sube, calvo; sube, calvo!?   24 El se volvió, los vio y los maldijo en nombre de Yahveh. Salieron dos osos del bosque y destrozaron a 42 de ellos.      Deuteronomio 25:11-12   11 Si un hombre está peleándose con su hermano, y la mujer de uno de ellos se acerca y, para librar a su marido de los golpes del otro, alarga la mano y agarra a éste por sus partes,   12 tú le cortarás a ella la mano sin piedad.

20071025060459AAbL6TL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	?haz dejado tus huellas en el camino de la vida?	Tú huella       "Lentamente cae un atardecer en la playa, caminas a paso lento, puedes percibir como cae la tarde, de repente se te ocurre voltear y bajar tu mirada. Y con ello te detienes a observar como vas dejando huella en tu caminar"   Con la anterior ilustración quisiera mostrarte querido lector que tu estas llamado a transformar el mundo, con tu propia manera de caminar por ese sendero que llaman destino.   Nunca caigas en la simplicidad de la vida, en andar por trayectos ya descubiertos, atrévete a romper tus propios prejuicios y paradigmas, y comienza a asimilar cada acto de la vida como una única oportunidad para trascender y ser feliz.   No seas otro más que solo existe. Que no tiene propósitos y que quiere vivir recostado a los demás creyéndose lo mejor del mundo, llegará un día donde la vida misma se encargará de hacerle ver a estas personas lo equivocado que estaban con respecto ala vida. Por lo general esto suele suceder al final del camino cuando ya todo esta consumado.   El problema hoy en día, es que las personas creemos que nos queda mucho tiempo; para enmendar un error, para emprender un propósito, para dar un abrazo y decir te amo.   Estamos equivocados al creer que el tiempo nos pertenece y no es así. No olvides que; "lo único que te pertenece es este instante y ya es pasado". Por eso tu debes de comenzar desde ya a trabajar en lo que anhelas en lo que sue?as. Aprende a ser constante por lo que una de las causas mas frecuentes de nuestros fracasos es la inconstancia.   Por eso te recomiendo que seas perseverante en lo que te emprendas y siempre cree en ti "ya que no hay nada imposible sino hombres incapaces".   Me quisiera despedir diciéndote que tu y solo tu estás llamado a dejar la huella que alimente el amor en este mundo. No dejes que tu vida quede en el anonimato ve y atrévete a dejar tu nombre grabado en la historia de la humanidad, eso solo lo podrás lograr si trabajas con amor en los dones que Dios te obsequió, día a día ve puliéndolos y perfeccionándolos ponlos al servicio de los demás, solo así podrás dejar tu propia huella... y recuerda siempre que no importa cuantos pasos distes hacia atrás. Lo que importa ahora es cuantos vas a dar hacia adelante.       !

People get all pissed off and protest the world over because of our yearly seal hunt that saves cod stocks,and fishermen's jobs, In both the US and Canada,as well as brings needed money to Eskimos living in a land where there is no other means of profit.Killing of Baby seals is banned and has been since the early 80s ,However no one protests at Spain's yearly slaughter in an extremely inhumane way of countless Bulls in the ring, who are picked with darts and long blades and  tormented,until they finally bleed out in the ring. This is the most barbaric form of cruelty I have ever seen a human Do to an Animal.Why is the world not boycotting Spain products to end their cruelty? At least the seal hunt has a purpose other then entertainment.What purpose do the bull fights have.The seal hunt has been around just as long so don't give me any tradition BS ,The seal could get away, and usually dies very quickly.The bull always dies a slow tormented death. A world of Hippocrates? For sure.

Im in love with someone who says she loves me but just cant continue our "relationship".	You see, she says she loves me & still gets intimate with me. She has no other person in her life. She texts me constantly & worries if I dont text her back.  We see each other almost 3-4 times a week.  But my problem is, she says she in NOT in love with me the way she used to but maintain a more noble love... I understand her point but i cant seem to move on.  How should I eact everytimes she says she loves me & I know it isn't the same kind of love that I feel for her.  I know I am still in love with her but I respect her decision because she is NOT comfortable with our relationship anymore ( same sex relationship ) isn't accepted here, you know.  How should I handle this?  I am willing to move on & be just a friend but I still feel territorial and we still share intimacies.I want us to be real friends & family too but as long as I am still in love with her I can't avoid but to get hurt knowing we dont feel exactly the same. She wants us to be "the same" minus the "relationship. HELP

20080507093009AAfhuVs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	?Qué universidad da titulo universitario de licenciado en ateismo?	En las universidades se estudia para ser teólogo o filósofo con sus respectivos títulos.   Pero no existe universidad que de titulo de licenciado en ateismo y es simple: como postura no llega ni siquiera a una disciplina como si lo es la teología, además el ateismo es una negación del teísmo puesto que la niega y critica, el ateismo es por lo tanto  dependiente del teísmo dado que si el teísmo como postura no existiese no habría que negar.       No me vengan con la etimología de ateismo ya que la conozco, ni tampoco con que solo es la falta de creencia u otras menos creativa como para ser ateo no se requiere de titulo o con salidas relamidas como tu pregunta no tiene sentido.Gracias.

20080508154510AATjuA6	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Alguna vez les ha pasado que cuando le gusta mucho una persona y logran tener algo no es lo que esperaban???	Pues les dire que desde hace par de meses, me gustaba o mas bien pensaba que me gustaba una amiga, pero resulta que hace 2 dias tuve la oportunidad de besarla (ella no es bi ni les), fue pura experimentacion, y como somos mejores amigas pues no le vimos nada malo, que equivocada estaba, el amor se me fue de jalon!, fue como besar a un pinguino, vale la pena decir que no tiene mucha experiencia en el area...   No habia emocion, creo que mi mano besa mejor que ella, me senti muy mal por ella pobre del novio que le toque, el caso es que me dijo que le ense?ara, pero no se como reaccionar ante esto, se me hace un poco incomodo pues me gusta mucho besar y lo hago muy bien pero ella es horrible...
