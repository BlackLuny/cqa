20090310025523AAf45WC	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My Land Rover V8i (1995) is leaking coolant from the head gasket. Is there an easy fix or is it going to cost?	My Land Rover V8i (1995) had an inspection a few months ago and the Land Rover workshop suggested the head gasket was leaking coolant and should be fixed (AU$1000 approx)      I then took the car to get a second opinion and was told it wouldn't need to be fixed. But now I'm on a 10,000km road trip and the coolant seems to be leaking - when I park after a few hours driving there's a puddle (approx 50-100ml) of green fluid under the drivers side near the radiator right at the front of the car. Looking under the car it's dripping from various parts of the engine.      Sorry for rambling, my question is: would a daily top-up of water/coolant be sufficient for the trip or does this kind of problem need an immediate fix?      Thanks in advance!   Matt

20090310035810AA9cVDt	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	Are you impatient and aggressive when you drive?	If so, then please hurry up and have an accident and die.      This may sound a bit harsh, but it is sometimes hard for the driver in front to concentrate fully on their driving when you are putting pressure on them. And if you caused them to have an accident you yourself would not stop and see if they are okay. You would just swerve around them and speed off, because that's the kind of asshole you are.       I believe myself (and other drivers) should have the right to drive down the road (on the speed limit) without being subject to your compulsive aggression.      So can you please just jump off a bridge, shoot yourself, jump in front of a train. Anything to remove yourself from the gene pool. This is preferrable to someone else being seriously injured or killed by your selfishness.

20090309132920AABoVVv	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Car started acting weird?	its 95 acura integra ls. yesterday i was driving back from work at night. it was raining very hard with puddles all over. and i have a long cold air intake(the one that goes to the bottom) on the way i filled my gas up all the way full. about 3 mins of driving after filling the tank i pulled from a traffic light and pushed the car a bit hard at about 4000- 4500 rpm and it did something I have never seen before, it was as if the gas pedal stopped responding I was in second gear and one second I was accelerating away and the next my car was slowing down and the battery light and some other lights in the cluster came on. it also started revving at very low about rpm about 200 it was as if its just about to stall. I pulled off and turned to car off I started it back up in about 2-3 mins and it drove fine. And after driving for about another 15 mins I tried to push it hard again and this time same thing happened when I reached around 4000 rpm. This morning when I started it and drove it was fine and I pushed it to 4000 no prob. But the engine feels kinda heavier. Any know what happened.

Assuming low usage, so only adding about 40-60,000 miles to it, and keeping it in good shape...      I was just thinking, that if I am going to lose 2,000 of its value on a 2004 model, and will lose 2,000 of the value of a 2008 in the same time frame... I might as well just get the 2008.      The extra money would sit in the bank if not, so let me know what you think from a purely investment standpoint.

20090309161031AATVOpV	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Dodge	Where do I find a switched hot wire on a 2008 Dodge Ram?	I've got a 2008 Dodge Ram 4x4 pickup, and I'd like to hard wire an after-market GPS system, so that the GPS comes on with the ignition, and it shuts off when I shut off the engine, the same as the radio or windshield wipers for example.        I have two cigarette lighter plugs, the left one does exactly what I need (the right one is always hot) but I can't figure out how to get at the wire and I can't find any other wires that are switched with the ignition.      Does anybody know how to find a wire under the instrument panel that is hot only when the key is turned on, or alternatively how to remove the instrument panel so that I can splice into the left cigarette lighter plug?

20090309164849AAIYFd2	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Low level coolant light on in car.  Is the sensor just bad?	A  new radiator was installed on a car just before I purchased it. After a couple of days I noticed that it was leaking coolant. The leak was coming from where the sensor plugs into the radiator. Now it appears that the leaking has stopped. While this was going on I topped off the reservoir tank every couple of days. I only drive about 14 miles a day and that is to work and back home. The reservoir tank is still full and the temperature gage stays at the ok level with no fluctuation, but that coolant light will just keep coming on. Is it safe to say the problem is with the sensor and not the radiator? I really wouldn't want to be on the road and see steam jetting out from underneath the hood as this would definetly be a very costly repair.

20090309121222AAu7piu	Cars & Transportation;Aircraft	Pilots: Is a gyrocopter a cheaper way to get a helicopter private license?	I remember that the aircraft used to train for the private pilot license is the category of aircraft you can fly. So, if you learn in a blimp, you can only fly airships. If you learn in a Piper, you can fly fixed wings.      I saw an an ad long ago, that by getting the PPL in a gyrocopter, you would save money over using a helicopter. You would then need just a little more instruction in a helicopter for a checkride (?) because they are the same category.      Is this true now? If so, would it be true if a person used a jet for the PPL (and money were no object)?

20090309125935AA9I3xP	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Will i lose my driving license?	I was caught (by a policeman) on 23/12/08 allowing my sister to drive my car. We were in a public car park, just practicing my sisters clutch control. I am insured and have no other driving (or other) offenses, but I only passed my test 12 months ago. My sister however only has a provisional license and was not insured to drive my car. We are in court on 9th April and I am terrified that I will lose my license. I have never been in trouble before, we just made a silly decision and a stupid mistake. We hadn't been drinking.   Has anyone been in a similar situation, or do you have any advice?    I work as a community carer, so I need my car for work. I would loose my job if I had no transport. Any sensible advice would be well received. Please no nasty comments as I feel bad enough as it is.    Thanks in advance.

20090309130149AAxiHnT	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	About how much money would a highly trained, extremely experienced auto mechanic make?	I'm looking for the salary of someone who's at the top of their field, perhaps only works on expensive cars, or whatever the case may be.  It doesn't matter if MOST people in the field don't make that much, just those few best.  Or if someone owns an auto mechanic/auto repair shop, how much would that person make?  Thanks!

20090309130547AAIlU7s	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why is my rear end making a squeaking noise?	I have a 2005 Buick Rendezvous with front wheel drive. When driving over bumps or uneven road I hear squeaking noises from both sides of the rear end. It seams to not matter what speed I'm driving, right turn, left turn, or reverse. I've even gotten out of the car and shook the vehicle from left to right and could hear the sounds. The break pads are in good condition. The tires are brand new. I hope this is enough information. Can any one help?
20090309130751AAj3JwP	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Sticking breaks?         (and some people like short & sweet questions)?	This is a 97 mercury sable.  The rear passanger-side breaks are grinding, and the noise continues even when pressure is not applied to the breaks.  The dashboard "break" light is on, indicating either that the parking break is applied (although it's in the released position), or that the break fluid level is low.  Can low break fluid cause the calipers to remain in the closed position, or not?  If this is a parking break issue, is there anything I can do/check to manually release it?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

20090309131349AA7Kxvq	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Will insurance pay to have a regular vehicle modified for a handi-capped driver?	I'm 17 years old. I have a medical condition called Osteogenesis Imperfecta which is Brittle Bones disease.      I use a wheelchair to get around. I also have dwarfism.      My mom doesn't want me getting my license till I graduate but even then I'll have to get a job before I can get a vehicle.      I know its really expensive to get a vehicle modified so I'd be able to drive it.      My question is would insurance pay for that and if not will a grant be able to?
