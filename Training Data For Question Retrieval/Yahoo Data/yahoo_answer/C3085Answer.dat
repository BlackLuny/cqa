6916093126abd5472b1d4fe798f4583caa	Firstly, I would just like to say that I have never once seen a bum or hooker in my neighborhood, nor in any of the neighborhoods where my friends live. Yes, there are places in the city where you'll find plentiful amounts of both, but there are still lots of stable areas in Detroit.<br>  <br>  That being said, Detroit is very inconsistent. There are beautiful, meticulously maintained mansions within blocks of boarded up shacks. There are thriving businesses right alongside failing ones. There are citizens who care about their city and citizens who don't. But you certainly can't characterize the whole thing as bad.<br>  <br>  There are also lots of things do here, especially Downtown and in the Midtown area. Museums are always hosting things, there are lots of music venues, and festival-type things are pretty common. <br>  <br>  To sum it all up, living in Detroit is not always easy and it's definitely not for everyone. But if you're looking for something different, than you should give us a try. We're secretly really nice and you'll be welcomed with open arms.<br>  <br>  (This got really long. And it sounds like a brochure. Oy vey.)|`|RYNqJ7zWaa	Detroit is pretty bad wherever you go.  Buildings broken into, bums on the street, hookers at the corners, it may be pretty at some parts but mostly it is bad.|`|PXMqXwflaa	Having grown up in Flint, I can understand why you would think Detroit would be more interesting. But it isn't. It is bigger, dirtier and even less friendly than Saginaw Street on Friday night, and is about as attractive as the Burton side of Dort Highway. <br>  <br>  Ann Arbor or Lansing are college towns with history and cultural offerings if you want to stay in Michigan. For bigger cities, go to the east or west coast. I live outside Washington, DC, and only return to Flint when its time to plant another relative. Otherwise, I'd never go back. What a depressing place!

cK28Kl0Uaa	give them back the laptop, it's theirs and you wouldn't want to create a bad reference for future employment over it.<br>  <br>  you are also probably not entitled to be reimbursed for the tires.<br>  Do they reimburse you mileage on the car?  If so & they are using the irs approved rates, the reimbursement takes into consideration maintenance and wear & tear on the car.<br>  <br>  if they aren't reimbursing you mileage, you should be able to get a tax deduction for that since you are using the car for business.  it would be a non-reimburseable business expense .  Again, maintenance and wear & tear would be included in the tax deduction amount.|`|xMqgB2GDaa	Yes and no. Legally, it's their property and if they choose not to reimburse you, you could sue them in small claims for it; but legally, it's their property. They are not legally obligated to pay for the tires, but again, you could sue them for it in small claims court.

dCIi9qf5aa	I was going to suggest that you go on line and find the headquarters. It sounds like it may be privately owned. Its not a chain I have ever heard of. Look in your telephone book under government, you might find the number for Board of health or food complaints. In the meantime write a letter to Chickadee's(write Attn: Manager) manager, describe exactly what you described to us and address it to the mall address.Make copies. You know shes going to get fired right? Have someone you know who needs a job apply before you send the letter and leave their resume. Go back a few days  later and observe. If you see her still there and no manager hovering around, and observe her doing the same thing, print up some flyers and leave them in the bathrooms, on counters,on the floor(accidentally) and on the ground in front of the mall (accidentally)stating your complaint. Then observe some days later. Also I would write a letter specifically to her and tell her how disgusting she was, the health hazards she caused and ask her why in this economy she just doesn't want a job? Give it to her and tell her someone paid you five dollars to give it to her.( say something like secret admirer eh?) Before you leave the house have your sister or mom hand you five dollars that you have given them and say "please take this five dollars and give this letter to that waitress" this is so you won't be a liar. Good luck.

1Mc6BOvKaa	How long ago were they sent, and using which level of service (first or second class / standard, recorded or special)?<br>  <br>  If they were sent first class, they may take up to three days, and second class may take up to a week.<br>  <br>  If the item was too heavy, it would be sent to your local postal depot. Your postman would then deliver a note saying there was an item waiting for you and there was an outstanding fee for you to pay. You would have to go down to the depot listed on the card, pay the fee and collect the item. If you haven't received a card like this, your mail is still en route.<br>  <br>  This system can't be perfect, some things will get delayed. Royal Mail in the UK handles 84 million items each day, so some are going to wander. Don't worry, they'll usually turn up, even if they are late.

aAGcYAsNaa	At age 13 you will need working papers if you're going for traditional employment.... it's hard to get a cash job at 13. If you can go without the pay (hah!) try volunteering - very often those jobs turn into paying jobs (places like museums, libraries, community centers). Babysitting could be rough - unless you have someone you know you can call in if things get out of control. Sometimes being a "mother's helper" (and dads need help too -) can be a lot of fun - families with several kids need an extra set of hands for trips, say to the beach, or wherever.|`|1I4TuZc7aa	babysitting
sYDFS8E0aa	Blues<br>  <br>  The legislation that covers the disclosure of criminal offences is the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (ROA) and in this case the terminology you should be interested in is 'spent.'<br>  <br>  Under the ROA, after a certain period of time, all convictions (except those involving prison sentences of over 30 months) are deemed to have been "spent". The length of time that must elapse before the conviction is deemed "spent" depends upon the nature of the sentence imposed and can be extended by subsequent convictions. Once convictions are "spent" the person is considered "rehabilitated". <br>  <br>  There are certain positions that don't have to abide by these regs and caring is one of them; the following link from CAB may be useful to you;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thevillage.org.uk/spentconvictions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thevillage.org.uk/spentconvic...</a><br>  <br>  Curtis|`|ouzrDPaSaa	It's down to the judgement of your employer.  I've worked in care for several years so have been through the CRB process a few times.  I think the general rule is that if the offence was a long time ago, and it didnt involve hurting someone or taking advantage of a vunerable person then it's okay.
