8nigkuTTaa	3. . . . <br>  <br>  They don't ::stink:: persay, but they are "musky."  It's not a bad smell, and it doesn't linger on your stuff, although they love to rub all over everything.  <br>  <br>  Their poo doesn't smell too bad, but there are drops you can put in their water to minimize that.  My ferret's poo doesn't small AT ALL.<br>  <br>  You will want to wipe out his/ her cage often.  Every week or so, really, just to make sure it doesn't get rank.  Mine is a free roaming ferret, even though he does have a cage (his litter box and his things are kept there) and we live in a tiny studio, and it doesn't smell like Ferretty.<br>  <br>  Also, you won't want to bathe your pet too much, because it dries out their skin and makes them produce MORE of those 'musky' smelling oils.  It comes from right behind their necks.  Sometimes, if I have a date coming over or something, I'll spray him with a little dog-grooming spray.  Just to be on the safe side about him stinking up my apartment.  Ha ha.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  I hope your dad lets you have one!  They're such great companions!  I sometimes wake up in the morning and he's sleeping on my pillow next to me!|`|eG7VKXz9aa	I have two and on a scale of one to ten.. I'd say about a 3-4 but its not really a "smell" as much as just musk. <br>  <br>  I use newspaper for mine and I empty out the paper daily, sometimes two to three times a day and give their cage a good scrubbing about once a week. I also wash their bedding once a week so for a couple days, they'll smell like laundry detergent. :]<br>  <br>  I say as long as you keep their bedding, cage and litter/paper clean, it won't be too bad. But, bathing can make the smell strong than usual. Their bodies will work in overdrive to replenish the oils that were stripped, so I'd recommend bathing only a couple times a year.|`|kjLHIJNRaa	I have 3 ferrets in my room, mine dont smell at all (granted I clean the litter everyday and I use newspaper and just throw it away when soiled b/c it doesnt smell as much as litter) and Im kinda a clean freak too. Mine arent in a cage, they are free roaming and I dont have an issue with smells, but if you do keep them caged then cleaning the cage at least once a week should be fine.<br>  <br>  Bathing a ferret often actually makes them smell more....it strips away their natural body oils and makes their glands produce more which in turn also makes more of a ferret musk smell. If you ever need to bath them use the Aveeno oatmeal bath packets (soap, shampoo's,ect... arent good for ferrets skin) oatmeal naturally cleans and also gives them a great neutral smell.<br>  <br>  Ferrets dont really smell, yes they each have their individual musk (but I kinda like it) and some have it more than others, plus you can only smell it when your holding them. <br>  <br>  Just make sure to clean the poop as much as possible (that the only thing that really smells).<br>  <br>  Also my ferrets are on a raw natural diet now and makes them and their poop smell less as well! <br>  <br>  Let me know if you have any other questions, I love to help when it comes to ferrets!|`|99rlaRchaa	get them castrated as well the smell is reduced by up to 90%, if you get Jill's the smell is reduced by 98%.

And don't even bath him that often.  Twice a year is usually plenty.  Changing bedding at least every couple days is a must.  Proper diet will also help with any odors.  They don't smell any worse than any other pets I've had.  In fact, have smelled people with more offensive odor.  Try going to the pet store with dad and actually holding one .. you can get a good idea of their scent and go from there.  Also check site below that has good info on ferrets .. care, handling, feed and healthcare.  They are great pets!|`|AA11887983	4 or 5,  depending on the ferret.  Remember, that the more often that you bathe it, the more it will smell.  The skin oils are produced more heavily after a bath,and they are what smells.|`|JgC9a8m2aa	Well, I have 7 ferrets that share my bedroom and I'd say the smell is  about a 2. It's really not bad at all - the litter box gets scooped twice daily; I do daily spot cleaning in the cage; the cage, litter box, and all bedding gets washed thoroughly twice a week (but even when I only did it once a week, the smell still wasn't too bad); I also clean the floor on a weekly basis (I have vinyl; if you have carpet, sprinkle some baking soda over it before vacuuming to help absorb any odors). That's about it. Oh, and when it comes to baths, I actually give oatmeal soaks (using colloidal oatmeal). During the winter, they get that twice a month (to help relieve their dry, itchy winter skin), and as needed throughout the rest of the year (usually not that often). Now, the oatmeal soaks can be done more often because they don't strip the skin like regular soaps and shampoos do. If you're using a regular shampoo, then I wouldn't bathe him/her more than four times a year.<br>  <br>  And, just a little note - descenting really doesn't have much affect on their on their overall scent, that just prevents them from being able to expel a poof of odor when frightened or overly excited. They have scent glands all over their body. The biggest thing to keeping the smell down is to keep everything clean. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OrvTG44laa	Only bathe them twice a year maximum.  Doing it once a month will dry out their skin, causing them to produce oils, which is what smells so bad.  Ferrets don't smell that bad.  It's not powerful, but you will smell it in the ferret's room.  It isn't an offensive smell- some people even like it.|`|AA10234242	4<br>  <br>  <br>  -w-|`|knFrwCxcaa	4-6
hdQvbs0naa	Well, my dog Dykstra was very healthy throughout his life. He was a chow chow/labrador mix. He lived to be 14 years old. His movement, eyesight, and bladder control began to go around the time he turned 14, and we had to have him put down. That was the only time we had to spend more than just checkups and shots. <br>  <br>  My cat Salem was only 7 when he passed away, and he had to be put down as well. He was breathing strangely one day and we brought him to the vet and did several tests. The vet said there was something wrong with his heart and he had to be put down. :[ That was costly as well. <br>  <br>  (Unsure of exact costs on these because they were my parents' responsibility and they paid the bills then)<br>  <br>  And (although he's not a dog or cat) my rat had a respiratory infection and had to go to the vet as well.

I took it to a great vet nearby, because I thought he had ingested some soapy cleaning water.  The vet didn't think it was that, thought it was some kind of virus.

The most common registration for racehorses is the US Jockey Club so if he was a racehorse, you would be able to track down his history because it is all recorded in a database based on his number. Things like his sire, dam, owners, and earnings from race wins is some of the information that you will be able to find.

BJGudd52aa	It all comes down to your willingness to MAKE it work. The thing with a saltwater tank is that the smaller you go, the amount of maintenance and time it needs increase exponentially. So if you're not willing to dedicate a decent amount of time (maybe 15 minutes a day) to the upkeep of it I'd probably consider otherwise.<br>  <br>  Though, I know for fact it can be done, and indeed, has been done many times by beginners over at <a href="http://nano-reef.com" rel="nofollow">http://nano-reef.com</a> :) The prime example of it would be el fabuloso's "sexy pico", a mature 3g reef which was awarded the Tank Of The Month a few months back - <a href="http://www.nano-reef.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=136990" rel="nofollow">http://www.nano-reef.com/forums/index.ph...</a> is the link. He also went to the trouble of preparing a guide to pico tanks, something which I feel is well written and passed down from a guy who started that tank as a beginner - <a href="http://www.nano-reef.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=180570." rel="nofollow">http://www.nano-reef.com/forums/index.ph...</a> If you choose to go the saltwater route, I strongly suggest browsing the Picotope forum on nano-reef, as these are probably the easiest to follow, and indeed, most well informed collective of picoreefers around.<br>  <br>  Whatever way you go, make sure you do your research.

fgxajTiBaa	Depends on whether it's Demodectic mange or Sarcoptic. My dog had Demodectic mange when I got him, and the vet prescribed Ivermectin. She told me if it didn't clear up within a week to bring him in for a chemical dip. It didn't clear up until week three and I'm glad I didn't follow her advice. It cleared up just fine and it hasn't popped up since.<br>  <br>  The only home remedies I've heard would be more for Sarcoptic. You could try using anti-bacterial soap, like that orange Dial and scrub it on the affected spots with a toothbrush. But Democtic is more of an immune issue, so it usually clears up when the dog is healthier.<br>  <br>  Mange is basically little mites that make your dog itch and lose hair. Sarco is contagious between dogs and even sometimes humans. Demo is not. All dogs have some amount of the mites on their skin, but only dogs with a compromised immune system will show the symptoms.

Out of sight, out of mind. Many pets kept outside are neglected. They may not be fed or given water because people forget. They may not get played with, groomed or get the proper vet care because people don't notice when the pet is sick.<br>  3. Pets are meant to be with people. This means being inside. If the family spends lots of time outside, then the dog can be out with them, but the dog should mainly be inside. <br>  <br>  Working dog are generally kept outside, but they are trained and worked with on a daily basis. These dogs are usually vital to the persons work (like a farm or livestock) and the farmer would not want to compromise their animals by neglecting their dogs.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Depends on the animal and its size, for many dogs being kept outside full time is better for them as long as they have plenty of room to exercise and a warm sheltered area to sleep. For the shelter to be warm as long as its windproof with a reasonable sized door and blankets or hay to keep them off the ground. In a built up area, ie in town if the dog tends to bark all night that may be a problem as well. Now if you are talking about a small lap dog then that dog was never intended to live outdoors.

How is the dog getting proper socialization with its owners and other people/animals if its constantly kept in the backyard?<br>  <br>  Reason 2.  Dogs kept in the backyard most likely aren't being supervised.  What happens if the dog eats something dangerous and/or chokes?  What if he steps on something or is somehow injured while out there alone?  The owner wouldn't even know there was a problem and the dog could potentially die.<br>  <br>  Reason 3.  There are lots of people in this world with bad intentions.  They could throw something over the fence to purposefully injure your dog.  They could steal your dog.  They could shoot the dog....<br>  <br>  Reason 4.  How is the dog being consistently and properly trained if it spends most of its time outside?  Chances are, its not.  A dog needs to work on its training every single day.  Just leaving it in the back yard means he's fending for himself and making his own rules.  That doesn't result in a well trained dog.<br>  <br>  Reason 5.  There is ALWAYS a chance that an unsupervised dog could escape from the yard.  Leaving the yard could prove fatal.  A larger animal could attack, they could be hit by a car, they could injure themselves and not be able to return home.  Not to mention they could be picked up by the pound.  If you didn't realize they were gone or didn't check the pound to find them, they'd likely be euthanized.

It takes a little time for them to get the idea, but most will eventually get it.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	I found a whole bunch of sites full of information about raising new born pups.

When my Basset Hound had puppies they also, I believe, lost a little weight. Not to worry, as newborn puppies tend to be slightly more active after their born then before when their in their mothers womb. Dont worry to much, because this is completely normal. Unless they lose a substantial amount of weight, just make sure their eating!!!<br>  <br>  =0|`|rXQgWJwcaa	Well i suggest trying the supplement allot. When my Pug had puppies they refused the supplement but i forced them to drink eat and soon they drink it without a fuss. And 9 puppies !!! WOW. Lucky you. Also make sure the mom is producing enough milk to feed all 9 puppies. <br>  <br>        Good luck with your puppies!!|`|QV2WQsd8aa	let them have momma as much as they want.  don't supplement if it's not absolutely necessary.  that being said, it's my understanding they should continually be gaining weight.  make sure they are all eating enough and sleeping well.  good luck with those little ones.
CqquoBy4aa	You will have a of fries because they only get pregnant (you need 6 females).  That would be really good if you have a lot of fries!|`|WBopwqTGaa	usually you want 2 to 4 fems for every male.<br>  when you have more males the more brightly tailed will be attacked causing fin rot,gill damage and even death, the females will also be harassed by 2 males at a time causing huge amounts of stress or also death.<br>  if you buy one more female  than what you have males than you'll be fine until they all become prego. so what i suggest is to buy 4 or 5 fems for your males and once you have enough money buy 3 more.<br>  also you'll need a bigger tank once the fry come around since you'll have over 100 fry within a month and a half to 2 months.<br>  anywhere between 25 to 40 gals can hold up to 100 fry or 50 to 60 guppy if you take extreme care of your water and ammonia levels.|`|DvXlfiI6aa	you have to have 2 females for every male which means you need 6 females... they don't fight they just get pregnant... you may have up to 100 "fry" in 1.5 months............|`|gD2vXJDeaa	Yes, the will. if you have 3 males then u will need at least 4 females, because they fight to the death.

She has to get up really early to let them out and feed them and let them out  before she goes to work, not to mention ensuring they have enough room to run free through the day, ensuring no way of escaping through the fences etc and trying to keep them safe from foxes, she then has to feed and water them when she gets home,, then chase them around in the dark to get them all in at bedtime, plus cleaning them out, and when ever she wants to go away for a holiday or break she has to factor in the cost of paying someone to care for them while she is away, and she hardly ever goes for nights out etc as she has her hands full with her night time routine for her pets!  but for all the work they are she really loves them, I guess you if you are a real chicken lover then its a good idea but otherwise jsut stick to free range eggs from the supermarket and visiting a farm to see the chickens!

Remember one thing though, chickens are not egg laying machines that go on for ever. Young chickens..(poults)  sometimes sold as 'point of lay' chickens, start off with really quite small eggs and increase in size as the weeks go by. Their egg laying will peak and then drop off for a while, before picking up again during their life span...which can vary considerably. Production will depend on breed....generally, the older the breed the fewer the eggs. A good , middle of the road chicken, is perhaps a Roade Island Red to start with. <br>  <br>  Lots of people start off with a few and end up with loads of different breeds and make almost a hobby out of them!<br>  <br>  They can be smelly...but only if you allow them to be..ie, keep them clean!<br>  <br>  The noise factor...generally a horny cockerel!!!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|zhrGiQsKaa	you should at least no how to take care of them before you get them. it would be easier to just buy eggs for 1.50 rather than feeding,cleaning and caring for chickens.
kceGobAXaa	have you been drinking?|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	are we talking a puppy|`|9kTejB0uaa	How old is this dog?  Dogs react to the moment - they don't bear grudges.  They may start to react to continually being abused and this can show itself in the form of aggression (fear biting) but amazingly they do forget and forgive if you have been rough with him, just once.  If he's a puppy 'going for legs, fingers, ankles etc' is perfectly normal.  But obviously has to be stopped as it can't go on into adulthood.  Turn away when he does this.  Say No Bite!<br>  <br>  As for the growling when he looks at you - this would need to be seen to be able to advise you because there is growling, and growling!! <br>  <br>  I think you need to take him to training classes, or find a personal trainer so they can see what's going on here, and advise you.|`|ZlFZtTlmaa	Say no in a stern voice if he growls, he is just being dominate, and he thinks he is the house leader and you are the follower, when you go somewhere he follows whatever you do together you do it first then the dog, he thinks hes the leader, and only give him treats when he lets you near him or you go first etc. if you give him treats to get him to you he will think growling is a good idea, thats the way they think, hope that helped.|`|34e847e50d5bd71ddfad58734e02d186aa	You are clueless about being a responsible dog owner.  There MUST BE someone in charge in your pack.  If it's not you, then the dog will elect himself.  It has NOTHING to do with how "nice" you've been to him.  It's all about the pack:  The pack needs a strong leader.  <br>  <br>  It will go much better for you to learn how to be a leader.  Do NOT hit the dog.  Read books.

Then if you want maximum milk for yourself, then you take the calf away, and feed it milk replacer.  The cow will continue to make milk for several months, depending on her nutrition and age.  This is what dairies do.  And you do it right away.

It may take a little while to find your "Diamond in the rough" but most quality saddles are older saddles anyways--good luck on your hunt! I would not suggest going with e-bay as it is hard to tell exactly what you're getting, if it will in fact fit your horse and if its a good quality piece of tack--good luck! Look for NBHA Saddlesmith, Blue Ribbon, Martha Josey pr Frontier Saddlery saddles----they are in my opinion the best barrel saddle brands/makers out there.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for tips, practice the elements of your run (ie pivots, leg pressure, Whoa, weight shift, lead changes etc.) separately instead of continually running the pattern to perfect it--running the pattern over and over will just psych out your horse and frustrate you--you need to break everything down and maintain a firm understanding of the concepts and then bring it all back together for your full barrel run<br>  <br>  Also TRAIL RIDE TRAIL RIDE TRAIL RIDE!! It will keep your horse sane and ride-able---keeping the horse away from the arena (which will mean "run" and "speed" to him/her) will keep him/her from getting ring sour and fried on speed--(psycho)--<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  BB

Dkb2ZR3Daa	If you are planning on docking for cosmetic purposes only, which I couldn't come up with another reason you would dock them-Don't do it.<br>  You yourself even said they are not show dogs. Plus you aren't going to hunt them, they aren't going to be used as herding dogs, etc. <br>  Therefor there is absolutely no point in docking their tails!!<br>  <br>  The only argument you could possible make as why to do it would be it helps with stool "cling ons" well so dose regular grooming. And poodles should be going into homes where they would be regular groomed.|`|o93EwErKaa	I breed Yorkies so docking is also called for in their breed standard.  My vet does it as 3 or 4 days old.  He pulls the skin back, quick snip and then uses stitches.  He says this method prevents a bald tip.  He also removes any dew claws at this time and simply places a "glue", rather than stitches.  I have never had a Yorkie pup display any pain afterwards or an infection set in.  <br>  <br>  I have one Yorkie with a non-docked tail and it is very unattractive.  It makes her look long in body and the hair is rather stringy looking and unkempt.  I can't say their are any health benefits, but I do believe you will have buyers not wanting to purchase your puppies and may even amputate the tail at a later date which is a lot more painful.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	I wouldn't I love seeing dogs with long tails and never have seen poodles with them.

I know it sounds horrible but the vet does them a couple days after birth so the nerves are not completely finished developing in the tail. For a Poodle, there is not real health benefit for them, it's all in a "look".<br>  <br>  If you are just planning on these puppies being sold as "pet quality", I would not bother doing the tails.

TSc8OE4vaa	If neither parent has the same fault as her, it is likely that she will grow out of it.  Many yearlings go through an "awkward" phase, during which they look like ugly aliens!  But most of them will grow out of it.  <br>  <br>  If the leg was bothering her though, I'd say it's a serious problem and not something she'll grow out of.  How old is she, and does it often give her pain?  Are you sure it was her flaw that gave her pain, and not an abscess or another lameness?  <br>  <br>  Buying her might be a good option, as if she is in A LOT of pain then you could give her a humane end via euthanasia... but only do that if it is too painful for her to live a normal life.  You could probably get her for very cheap... the horse market is terrible right now and they don't seem too attached to her.<br>  <br>  So, if I were you I'd buy her either way just to get her out of there.  Then have a vet check her out (maybe do the vet check first...) and have the vet see if it's a serious problem or something she'll grow out of.<br>  <br>  What's she being fed?  Does she have good or bad nutrition?  This problem could also be caused by poor food.  Maybe since they hate her so much they're feeding her junky feed and giving the other horses better more expensive stuff?|`|xLNzdxsOaa	Although I don't really have much experience with that sort of thing, I would say the best thing to do is to get her out of there. She will probably be very cheap, and if it is a problem that can be corrected they certainly don't sound like they're doing anything to fix it.<br>  If she isn't getting proper nutrition then she won't grow up healthy and strong, and if they're lunging her and she's hurting then its probably going to get worse. If they really hate her that much then they might even send her to slaughter. If buying her is an option, do it. If it's not, find someone who will or tell the humane society.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	If she's not too expensive, i would go ahead and buy her for the horse's sake.

If she is limping on her leg that could mean that she could be sound on and off throughout the rest of her life.

It really all comes down to what you can do for her and I am sure you could give her the best life possible if you experienced!|`|KJqaQyJ7aa	YES it is wrong to treat her that way they should be turned in. no as for her legs it would help to know how old she is it most likely will not get better but that should not be the part that you should worry about the horse is not asking you should you help but will you help do not let her down HELP HER:|`|cbORKjiGaa	report those monsters to the humane Society then adopt her through them. no animal should have to endure that kind of treatment i don't care how much of an inconvenience they think she is. even if she has to be put down 1 day of happiness is worth 1 year of hell. and if these people are not reported they could do it again

Instead of getting scammed, you can adopt a mix (possibly even the type you were looking for!) for far cheaper... and save a life doing so.<br>  <br>  Read:<br>  <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~NoPuppyMillsVA/Poo-dogs___Designer_Mutts/poo-dogs___designer_mutts.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.comcast.net/~NoPuppyMillsVA/...</a> (Poo-dogs & Designer Mutts)<br>  <a href="http://www.showdog-magazine.com/Articles/DesignerMutts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.showdog-magazine.com/Articles...</a> (Designer Mutts)<br>  <br>  Adopt a mutt: <br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com</a><br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|pc7ZjexJaa	well<br>  <br>  labradoodle is a lab poodle<br>  golden is a golden retriever poodle<br>  <br>  similarities?<br>  mutts<br>  waste of money<br>  <br>  <br>  solution?<br>  find a mix at a shelter if you want a mutt<br>  you won't be throwing away money then|`|ktC40jtXaa	Labradoodle is a labrador retriever and poodle mix<br>  Goldendoodle is a golden retriever and a poodle mix<br>  <br>  Just fancy names for mutts.|`|qEOJzbJraa	Well either way, they're both mutts.|`|0pVXLyGhaa	Everyone here seems so against the breeding of these mutts, but there is a point to it.  Dogs are bred to poodles to help with shedding problems.  They are trying to IMPROVE the golden retriever or labrador by making a low shedding companion dog with the temperament of a golden or a lab.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I just have a regular toy poodle, but I can fully understand why people want to create poodle mixed breeds.  <br>  <br>  Of course, not all dogs that are labradoodles or golden doodles take after the poodle coat, there is an unpredictability with the mixed dogs because the standards haven't been established for generations, but there definitely is a purpose behind these mixed dogs.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Uh oh.  You're gonna get yelled at for calling a "mutt" a name like Labradoodle and Golden Doodle.  Be prepared!  "Its a mutt or a mongrel.  NOT a breed!"  lol<br>  <br>  A Labradoodle is a mix between a Labrador and a Poddle.  A Godlendoodle is a mix between a Golden Retriever and a Poodle.  They are just mixed breed dogs and the term is a way of saying which two breeds they were conceived from.  Its obviously not a legit breed though.|`|nHp8zzkjaa	One is a poodle and lab<br>  One is a golden retriever and Poodle<br>  <br>  Both breeds are very smart and are considered large dogs.

2CbfO4jWaa	well since you havent listed any real details about your husbandry id say its not that important to ya. and the little bit you did provide sounds like they are being kept horribly. soooooooooooooo since you dont put too much of an emphasis on your captive husbandry(you dont think that its important) id say they are stressed out do to improper care and that your husbandry the cause of the feeding / health issues.<br>  you started off with a very inappropriate species and they will not last long when kept in sub standard conditions. e-mail me with details of your husbandry and maybe we can turn this around. good luck.<br>  <br>  p.s. baccari should never be housed together unless they are fully hydrated acclimated and compatible. you should think about separating them till such time.|`|oRXdDPBvaa	they are geting yustu to the new habitat.

cY8DgJv5aa	Check your local animal shelter.  Sometimes they'll have a special going on where they'll neuter any animal for one flat rate.  You can also call around and see what local vet offices are charging.  They also sometimes run specials.  One Saturday a month they'll do spay and neuters for $35 per animal or whatever.|`|RnYG4fiRaa	you can get a voucher from your city hall,, the voucher will pay the cost completly depending on your dogs weight..|`|bchci2Dkaa	Check with your local ASPCA.<br>  They probably know where you can get it for free.<br>  Mine did.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	Call your local shelter- they should be able to help you. ;-]<br>  <br>  Good luck & thanks for being smart & neutering! :D
AA10401377	As far as shedding-I don 't believe there is a shampoo for this the best thing is to brush your dog daily! I use a furminator every 2 days and regular brush in between. Also in the winter months when the air is dry I use Selsen Blue shampoo for dry skin(people shampoo)leave it in for 5 minutes then rinse WELLLLLLLLLL and apply conditioner and leave it in for 5 minutes then rinse-you may even leave alittle in. In the warmer months when the furnance isn't running and the airs not so dry I use oatmeal shampoo(dog shampoo-its faster and easier to work with) I have German Shepards and they have corse thick coats and in the winter months I'd rather take more time to make them more comfortable but in the summer months dog shampoos faster. Both run about $7-8 a bottle. Most importanly brush brush brush! Human shampoo is safe to use as long as your dog shows no allergy to it (look for shampoos without  heavy perfumes) JUST ALWAYS RINSE GOOD! Dog shampoos are easier to rinse out but I don't beleive them to be as moisturizing- the moisturering dog shampoos tend to have oil or gel silicon in them which causes the animals coats to attract dirt and they get dirtier faster MY OPINION!|`|XCG6ejG5aa	I use head and shoulders shampoo for my Jack Russel  and she has very bad skin and she is sooo soft after that! You can get it at like any store really it's maybe $5-$10 maybe?|`|8aOTvtEUaa	only wash your dog with dog shampoo!! oatmeal shampoo is the best for them it helps stop itching and won't dry out there skin. As for the shedding i've heard the Furminator works great and you can get it just about anywhere it's not a shampoo but it reduces shedding alot.
p0Jbbkopaa	If you've never had a dog or have only had something like a maltese, I would not suggest it.<br>  <br>  They are absolutely wonderful and smart, but require someone who knows how to train them and can give them the exercise they need. A good friend has one and it's the best trained dog I know. <br>  <br>  They are extremely smart and think for themselves unlike many other breeds. You need to get them to respect you..a pushover doesn't stand a chance.|`|cETQuE9waa	Yes they do shed quite a bit.<br>  They do have a lot of energy and are high strung.  They can be quite a challenge to train if you are inexperienced. <br>  They are good at agility. <br>  Personally, I am not a fan of the breed.|`|s23w0I3Baa	of course they shed. personally way to hyper and high strung for me.|`|bchci2Dkaa	I have seen a wirehaired variety of Jack Russel's that do not shed (or at least not as much as the smooth haired variety)<br>  Jack Russel's tend to be extremely hyperactive, and jump on everyone. They can probably be trained not to jump as much but they need a LOT of activity.<br>  Also, they're very vocal. They'll bark at anything and everything that comes too close.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	They do shed, but mine is the best dog. I wouldn't describe her as hyper, but in my world, she gets lots of exercise. She's extremely smart and athletic, but very set in her ways. She kind of came in and took over the house. She runs the show. She has more personality than most humans and is a blast.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	If you met my neighbors JRT, you'd never want one lol.<br>  <br>  They are much to hyper and independent for my liking.  These are dogs that were developed to hunt down and kill vermin.  They're tenacious, they're incredibly sneaky, they dig, they'll climb, they'll bounce off walls ... <br>  <br>  My neighbors JRT leaned how to climb over the fence, taught the lab to do it too ... then they both ran off to kill a little poodle.  True story.  Oh, and the darn things barks all day long.|`|fa94015ff5f0c6080fd3861b1e008e8caa	yes they shed. but less if you groom them about once or twice a week.<br>  they are very friendly little dogs. there smart and active.<br>  some of them may be aggressive and protective.<br>  <br>  they were originally bred for getting the rats out of the sewers so there tough little guys who mean business :P :) I like them
fqi5ttoiaa	that could definitely be the problem. i would just get a new bulb. for the fish its the same thing as you staying in a  room with a strobe light, its not good. my fish get stressed even if i turn it off and on a few times. <br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  also your name is adrienne just like my sisters. i have seen maybe three other people spelled the same way:)|`|b78fab33e75cbaffbfb8681182c1293caa	Fish need a good day/night cycle. Flickering lights disrupt this cycle, causing stress. Your fixture may need changing if a new light bulb doesn't work.|`|sNsdERusaa	Make sure your light is screwed in properly/tight enough
IlRcxaDtaa	These are not harsh spurs. They are less harsh than Prince of Wales spurs because they roll off of the horse's side, whereas the Prince of Wales do not. These look like regular ball-spurs, and the longer neck would allow for it to be used more easily on the side of the horse. If you are looking for a more unobtrusive spur, get the smaller neck.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	On this spur, the "neck" is the straight part which connects the part on your boot to the little wheel at the end.  What it's asking is if you want short or long spurs.<br>  <br>  These spurs look kind of harsh.  Are you sure you need that sharp of a poker?  Most english horses who need spurs do just fine with the standard "Prince of Wales" spurs, which are pretty much all "neck" with nothing on the end that pokes the horse.|`|b462bb31b1e46d7eee25b635f2a8ee28aa	Driver,  the rowel is plastic...
WBopwqTGaa	make a community tank!! they're great<br>  get some guppy,molly,sword fish,endlers,and platy<br>  small quantities of each because they breed fast.<br>  your aquarium will look colorful alive and very very cool.<br>  get fake or real bright colored or natural colored plants with maybe some decor like a wrecked ship or a Mermaid statue.<br>  and for the benefit of the fish get a water tester<br>  for ammonia,hardness,pH,nitrate and nitrite and research before you buy any fish so you and your pet can have a good experience!<br>  hope this helps!|`|dCWxpfjcaa	I like small cichlids myself.  They usually have the color of salt water fish but are fresh water fish.  They tend to have a little more personality than goldfish as well.  3-4 red zebras or bumblebee cichlids could do well in a 29 gal.  check out the shops for cichlids. some have a different variety but just as colorful.|`|3GjotXPXaa	this is a group of freindly tropical fish that i have in my 29 gal:<br>  6 neon tetras<br>  4 harelquin rasboras<br>  1 male betta<br>  3 mollies<br>  2 platy's<br>  2 siamese algae eaters(SAE's)<br>  2 dwarf gourami's<br>  (all very easy to take care of and they sell food that all of these fish eat)|`|1orBemFyaa	south american dwarf cichlids.  but only if you have enough experience, their kinda hard to take care of them.  search them on websites, their amazingg fish, and very colorful.  but i also suggest to get a school of non cichlids, it makes them relax.  best of luckk!|`|f8RBtCVAaa	1 male betta, 12 neon tetras, 1 blue groumie,1pink groumie, 6 corry cats, and 3 angle fish.|`|K4Q3eirFaa	if you go to the pet store they usually have many many fish there.<br>  my favorite ones are the ones that look like fat goldfish except they have bulging eyes and cheeks (:|`|VSdhrf2Saa	get 2 green spotted puffer they are reallllllly cute :D
pQbYaNf2aa	There are a lot of hypoallergenic dogs, the kinds that don't shed too much like shih tzu, yorkie, schauzer and maltese. My hubby is extremely allergenic to pet dander yet he is fine with our shih tzu.<br>  <br>  Your dad has  a point of not letting you own one. It is not easy being a dog owner. You should have the heart and money for it. Hypoallergenic dogs cost an average of $40 a month to groom. You have to add the cost of vet and food. How much time you can devote to walk your dog? Smaller breeds need regular exercise too. <br>  <br>  If you think you can be responsible to own one, go ahead and prove to your dad that you can. It is really rewarding and wonderful.<br>  <br>  Should your Dad lets you, please consider adopting from local shelters. There are tons of furbabies waiting for their second chance.<br>  <br>  Show your dad a photo of a dog that you are looking into adopting, that should melt his heart. Tell him that this pooch needs a loving home soon and you will take good care of him/her. "Pull from the heartstring".|`|8TLCxEJzaa	Well there is definitely a breed that doesn't affect your allergies, but I don't know it. Obama has (or was planning to get) a dog and the dog breed doesn't affect dog allergies.<br>  <br>  About convincing your dad. Show him that you are responsible enough for a dog. Don't know how to do that but good luck!|`|n7gz1sQHaa	You may be in luck.<br>  <br>  I also have dog and cat allergies however I have a small dog who doesn't bother me at all.<br>  <br>  I did a fair bit of research before I got my dog, she's a Silky Terrier. They kind of look like Yorkies only a little bigger and abit scruffier.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Silky_Terrier" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_...</a><br>  <br>  Yorkies are considered hypo allergenic too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Terrier" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_T...</a><br>  <br>  Silkies don't have the same kind of fur as normal dogs do, and you'll notice that when you pat one. Because their fur is different alot of allergy sufferers find that Silky fur doesn't bother them.<br>  <br>  They also don't shed like most dogs do so you won't have huge amounts of fur etc around the house. They only have one layer of silky fur compared to most dogs which have three separate layers.<br>  <br>  They also don't get that doggy smell that most dogs get, which is definitely one of their perks (I live in a rental so the place can't smell or be covered in fur).<br>  <br>  Silkies are great companion dogs, they'll pick a person and be 100% loyal to them. <br>  <br>  I would find it very strange if you were allergic to a silky (although some people wash them in weird stuff).<br>  <br>  As far as your dad goes, he's probably concerned about the mess/smell and things (which is why I mentioned a silky). Maybe your mum and yourself could take him to see a few different dogs and try and warm him to the idea that way.<br>  <br>  He may not like dogs based on the things I previously mentioned, so if you find one that isn't those things, you may have better luck.<br>  <br>  Because Silkies are companion dogs, your dog will be wanting to spend as much time as it can with you. My dog doesn't demand attention all the time she just wants to be curled up/lying next to me whenever she can.
3TM4TLdfaa	heres what you do: you just let him get used to you; feed him treats when he acts just the least bit good and it may take some time but your work will pay off and i think it was nice of you to save him from an abusive owner. just be sweet with 'em and don't scare him or make any loud noises when around him.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	If your cockatiel is an adult and has been abused and was not handfed or socialized properly, I hate to say it, but you most likely will never earn its trust. Thats why I don't rescue birds unless they are still friendly. I feel bad for them, but I'd rather have a nice pet. I would just say to let him be. If you can hold him on your finger, thats great. Keep doing that. You may never be able to pet and cuddle him.|`|X76BnjUlaa	watch him 2 find out what his favourite seed is and take it out of his seed bowl.

Dkb2ZR3Daa	She needs to be seen by a vet immediately, where bloodwork and a urinalysis can be conducted. <br>  **A toxic dose of Ivermectin is 10-20X the recommended dose<br>  <br>  1/10 of a cc per 10 lbs-is how Ivermectin is dosed. So you need to let the vet know how much you think she ingested from the paste/how much you used.
grklGFwBaa	Might as well get both. If you don't like snake bites, let one hole close up. Sometimes lip rings can be big and with snakebites, people usually do studs.

Why not get a real snake and pay him|`|PIQM6ln3aa	lip; go4it|`|t2wdH9qLaa	to begin with this question should not be in the title "Reptiles" it is clearly a fashion question. Snake bites are the new rage and seem easier to kiss with, they also have a better chance to go wrong. lip piercings have less factors to get infected but must be cleaned and sting when you try to eat with them on when you first get it done. but remember when choosing when your 30 would you rather have 1 or 2 holes in your face???|`|XUnsJ2xjaa	i agree. it will be hard to get a job. When a lot of people look at you will a lip piercing or snake bites, most people will be eew, and take you differently. but be yourself and pick whichever one you feel more comfortable with!!!|`|BXvkZwqAaa	both completely overdone. i say, think of something more original. <br>  <br>  fyi, i'm not talking smack when i say this - i'm dead serious. everyone has one of the other.|`|6odDiOdTaa	none im afraid of infections and dying from them but i would go for only one on the lower lip so its only one pain|`|ii1AtjJ9aa	it will be hard to get jobs with those piercings.

F32uPjAraa	Careful, she's about to pounce. Joking. How cold was the carrying cage? This sounds like a natural reaction to the low temperature. Keep an eye on her, it should stop in a while. If not contact your vet.|`|hqWz038paa	She's most likely just cold. <br>  <br>  it sounds like what mine does when he's cold.<br>  give her a rag or something to cuddle up in and keep warm. <br>  I live in michigan and in an old drafty attic, so it gets really cold in the winter. He just sleeps in his little wooden cave thing in the summer, but in the winter I have a lamp on at all times and I made him a winter house ( a kleenex box with an old winter hat sewed into it) which he curls up in to keep warm.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	What did you use to clean out the tank? Is it possible that there is still some soap or whatever you used left inside? This could be causing her seizure like movements. Also, this could be a climate misshap side effect i.e. incorrect temperatures.

zWFJBlJZaa	Not all dogs would allow this, but if she has no trouble with the vacuum cleaner you can use the small, soft bristle brush and gently vacuum her face (she might actually enjoy this as it will be like a massage).  Put flea powder in your vacuum cleaner bag and it will effectively kill off the little buggers that get sucked up!!!|`|yXUS7jz5aa	You can use flea powder on her face if you are careful. another way of getting rid of fleas is to feed your dog raw garlic every day,it takes about a month to take affect but it Works.|`|4WvhEwkVaa	First, give her a good bath in some anti-flea/tick shampoo. Then, try a flea collar. They only cost a few bucks and will probably keep the fleas away from her face. This is such a sad situation. If things don't get better, please take her to the vet and see what they suggest. Good luck!
CNSGz12zaa	You can train him..mine was 2 years old when I got him...He bit at first but after a lot of handling he got used to me...I let him go on my shoulder and he liked that then I gradually worked him to go to my hand. He now is 12 and comes to me when I call him--he flys to me, I never keep cage closed and he sits on top usually but I DO NOT recommend this as your bird can get killed if he flys into things..it took a while for me to get him to do this,|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	First of all, having grey eyes means nothing about the ages. You tell a parakeet's age by it's head. If your parakeets has bars on its forehead then it is young (about 4 months). Even an old can be tamed, but they need time to tame like all pet birds. You parakeet is just nervous give it some time to adjust to it's new environment. Talk to your parakeet in a calm voice so it knows you aren't a threat. When you change the food and water do it slowly so you can get your parakeet used to your hand. Try giving your parakeet treats like spray millet by hand at first they might be afraid, but they will soon like it. Your bird can talk. Parakeets know how to talk especially the males you can tell a parakeet's gender by it's cere (nose) if it is blue or a little purple cere than it is male, if it is female it would have a tanish or white cere. I hope this helps. If you want more information on parakeets try finding this book at your local library or bookstore. The book is called, "Your Happy Healthy Parakeet 2nd edition".|`|rmSdDT5Faa	they will do that, keep your hand in there and still for it to warm up to you and so it will come to you as opposed to you going to it, its trainable but it will take time for it to get used to you. all animals are trainable with in reason.<br>  <br>  work with it, if you have the patience it will too

cGRyDCpQaa	Don't worry about height... as long as you can control the horse. I'm shorter than you and my QH is 16.3hh, and I've been on taller horses. I've never had a problem with cues.<br>  <br>  I say go for it! I'm trying to purchase a belgian colt myself.<br>  I love drafts! I don't think it's silly at all to look. They're not only for tall men...|`|meoRbjgCaa	A draft cross may be better (too keep under the 16 hh ideal)  Gypsy Vanners are drafts but usually smaller (like 14.3-15).  Another really cool horse are the Norwegian Fjords.  They are larger than ponies but smaller than horses and are built like little tanks.<br>  Just a few facts to keep in mind when you go DRAFT:  <br>  Just remember when you go for a draft everything is waay more expensive.  Shoeing those feet usually costs 200-250$ each time they are shod.  Saddles and tack are sometimes scarce and much more expensive (as they don't fit normal tack), and they eat (and crap) much more. Oh, and if they step on your foot, you will lose or break it.  <br>  my husband wanted a draft as his first horse because they look really cool, but as I fit the horsey bill for the both of us, that wasn't going to happen! thank god, because he has gotten stepped on a few times :-)<br>  On the upside though, they do look really cool and their known to be very docile! so go for it. may want to invest in some steps though.|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	yeah there are tons of riders who ride draft breeds. "clydies" are great, as are percherons or, though you may struggle getting one, friesians are awesome. (sorry i might have spelled that wrong). and i've known a few shires to be good riding horses. just be aware that your legs need to be long enough to reach the "buttons," my trainer calls them, so the horse understands your cues. good luck! have fun!|`|BbdWpp1Caa	I went from a welshie at 10hh to a wb at 17hh. I had no control whatsoever at the faster paces...Lucky he was on trial. I eventually found another at 14.3hh. <br>  <br>  (but my sister began riding a 16.1hh horse) so go for it!|`|aWgdX0pZaa	do it.<br>  <br>  You are dying for our opinions? would mine kill you? LOL|`|ecf159d9c2d48432e189d0cac81882e2aa	I say go for it!<br>  At least look into it!<br>  <br>  I think it would be really fun to own a Clyd!! <br>  I exercise my instructor's Belgian cross mare and I love riding her!<br>  <br>  It will definitely be a step up from your Welsh! But since you have lots of experience I'm sure you'll adjust quickly.<br>  <br>  I love big horses - mine are both 17 hands. :) <br>  But I'm 5'8''... so I kind of need it. ;) <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|t4yBwlr6aa	If you're looking for a draft breed, try something like a Belgian, although i will tell you... Drafts are definitely more for experienced horse owners, so make sure you research each breed that you're interested it.... Drafts are known for their gentleness.... Other than that.... I'd say go for it, and good luck hun !!|`|6jg5vMakaa	I have a Belgian cross and I would say  go for it  just remember when things go wrong its a LONG WAY DOWN|`|wu47J6WPaa	do it|`|B94Poxv4aa	Draft horses are wondefull and you should explore. There is many wonderfull crosses out there, half of draft and let's say half of QH. They are steady and easy to handle and am sure there is a lot out there waiting to be adopted instead of purchased. Look into that. <br>  Height wise i ams ure you will adjust fast, look into temperament and training of the animal, more than the height - I would suggest.<br>  I went from a welsh pony to a Percheron (just to ride, I would never sell my Welsh) and it was awesome, like riding a comphy couch, lol!<br>  I am also intrested more in the horse itself, than breeds and shows, have fun!

UIM8X38Oaa	I have dealt with colic, she sound like she will be fine but I would suggest you go out and check on her a couple times tonight. If she is fine I wouldn't stay up all night.  Sounds like she got over it.  And then just keep an I on her.  Follow what the vet said to do.  You did good:)<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|k0ChtBoIaa	yes,<br>  that happened to my moms horse.<br>  he got colic because of sudden change of weather.|`|G4achLMPaa	If you're worried about feeding her, start her back on grain slowly, like 1/2 qt mash and 1/4 flake hay several times a day for the first day. Increase to 1qt mash and 1/2 flake the next day and so on as long as she's ok. She should be fine though, it sounds like gas colic.|`|jr5EgB2Taa	I think she will be okay.  As long as things gastrointestinal are moving and she isn't miserable, she should be fine.  If she was still really bloated, making weird sounds, or had behavioral changes, I would recall the vet.  However, since you said the bloating has gone down, you can breathe a little easier.  Definitely check the vets exact instructions.<br>  You are doing a good job.  Calling the vet when there is a problem is the best way to create a time line should the situation not improve or worsen overnight.  <br>  My mom used to camp in the barn when there were problems with her horse, probably would be a good idea, just to keep an eye on her.<br>  Also check with your vet about possible food allergies (sounds weird to do for horse, but check anyway).  She may have gotten in to something when you weren't looking (like mushrooms which thrive in Spring and Fall).|`|t4yBwlr6aa	As long as the horse is up moving around and defecating, she should be FINE... although, you may want to watch her.... I would also walk her for a bit, just to make sure..... When a horse colics, you always want to make sure they stay on their feet and walk them... also make sure they're using the bathroom.... Hope this helps ans GOOD LUCK !!|`|B6zl0AJDaa	It sounds like you didn't wet down the beet pulp.  How long have you been feeding it?  It's best to soak it for at least 2 hours before feeding.<br>  <br>  Do you feed bran at all?  I normally bran my horses twice a week with a 1/2 of a 3 LB coffee can of red flakey wheat bran and add boiling water so that it can steep and to that add 1/2 C of Corn Oil and 1/2 C of Apple Cider Vinegar. <br>  <br>  Call your vet and ask if you can give her a bran mash.

Some vets want to wait out of season, but since she is cycling sooner, you will have to find a vet to spay her now.<br>  <br>  Do NOT let her outside or around any unneutered male.  She could have been spayed at 3-4 months old.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Spaying/neutering not only prevents unwanted animals from being euthanized, but it helps your pet avoid future behavioral and health problems.

AA11901352	your goodoo more than likely is just suffering from excess stress  How long have you had him?Unfortunately you will have to determine if it is from the stress or if he has a bacterial infection going on.<br>  <br>  Ich is another possiable problem.  That can quickly be ruled out especially after a few days and there is no visable signs.  You will want to keep the stress levels as low as possiable right now and the water quality high.  If you see he still has the cloudy eye after a week then I would think about treating with an anti bacterial.

So if you had a snake you'd get the benefit of having lots of mice.. although they'd be frozen.<br>  No animal is suited to being bought on a whim, which is what it sounds like when you're asking about two COMPLETELY different types of animal.. but snakes even more so. They need very specific husbandry/care in order to stay healthy.. and when they do get ill, the vet bills can be very pricey. I'd definitely consider the mouse if you were adamant on getting a pet, though if you're still dead set on a snake, do your research and join a reptile forum and ask LOTS of questions first.|`|rmSdDT5Faa	the question is, would you want to feed your snake mice.... if you cant bare to see that which is pretty sad seeing the pinkies being eaten id say go with the mice, they are cute and entertaining pets as opposed to snakes. my personal opinion|`|jX2GErqWaa	<a href="http://thisinall.makes.it" rel="nofollow">http://thisinall.makes.it</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|70iWkzUKaa	mice are great pets but snakes bite so stick wit duh mice|`|HN5dIrlYaa	eww none
7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	We have a very small cat (a manx) and she got pregnant at 7 months old. We were very worried about her giving birth and being pregnant when she looked like she was just a kitten. She ended up giving birth to 5 kittens, 2 died at birth and one was quite large and looked healthy, but our vet told us that it probably was stillborn and that's normal for a small cat, to have babies that look as though they were healthy, but do not make it. The mother is very nervous having kittens, so try to leave them alone as much as you can (that was the hardest thing for me because baby kitties are so cute), and I would keep the male away from them because male cats will try to eat the babies no matter how long they have been with the mother. They do that because they are only out to breed. Cats don't get pregnant because they are in love, they get pregnant because they are in heat. Males will eat the babies to get them "out of the way" so the mother will breed again. Our male cat wasn't very nice to the babies until they were about 5 weeks old. Leaving the care of the kittens up to the mother is best because otherwise she will start to feel threatened and will move them to a place that you won't be able to get to and maybe not even find. I had a cat once who was so afraid of the neighbor kids messing with her babies that she moved them so much that one got its neck broken. It was so sad, but if they had been left in a place that was comfortable, quiet and rarely used then she would have left them there. Food and water should be kept where she can get to it without having to leave her babies for very long. Also, a litter box is helpful as they don't like to leave their babies for long. It will make them so nervous they will just go to the bathroom wherever they are if there is no designated area. Our cat started using the floor wherever she was at the time until we put a litter box. Awww.... if she purrs everytime you pet her even with her babies she must trust you very much. That would mean you're doing a good job of caring for your cat.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Hey Mechanical Man, when did she say that she didn't want the kittens? Or that she won't get them all spayed or neutered? And if you're not the one going to adopt them, it's not your problem now is it?|`|oIY2Dgafaa	yes, obviously you should bring her food and water.<br>  to "make sure she cares for them" ? you don't need to do that<br>  she knows what to do and how to treat her kittens.<br>  after all, sometimes animals value their babies more than humans.|`|iLEAWAwuaa	<a href="http://www.petplace.com/cats/care-of-the-new-mother-cat/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/cats/care-of-the...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+2138&aid=906" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a><br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/pregnancybirth/a/pregnancybirth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/pregnancybirth/...</a>|`|HT7261Mwaa	my cat also had her babies today :)<br>  she had 4 also well i out her food and litterbox neear her <br>  and she's rdoin fine thank god hope everything goes well|`|q7GBzr6yaa	Give her trat, watr an food!!|`|jJO7Y2Keaa	do everything you can to make her feel comfortable that is her spot for now but as the babies get older she will move them to where she feels she can be a mother and care for them. but always keep checking on her to make sure she is taking care of them and she is doing okay and as for the father cuz i think you said you had a male.. i would keep him a way for a little bit becuase mothers become very pertective..|`|BAVPrCAeaa	yes, bring her some water and food. But dont expect her to touch it for a while because she will be busy caring for her babies. In a couple of hours maybe a couple of days she will be realy hungry and wanting that. I would try to keep your distance and not touch the kittens and let the mom take care of them. Cats are very protective of their newborns and if you bother her to much she will go into hiding with her kittens. Also another thing that could help is getting a blow mixing some milk and egg and heating it in the microwave for about a minute and putting it right next to her. I used to do this when my cats where giving birth it gives them back their engery and vitamns that they lost when giving birth. Good luck!|`|i0y3CYoHaa	I'd make a nice, comfortable 'nest' for her close to a heat source (your heaters / a vent / artificial fireplace)... It'll free up your couch and keep it safe from the mess the kittens will make for their first few weeks.<br>  <br>  Put the food and water nearby, and I'd recommend getting some good canned food (kitten brand is best, she'll need the rich nutrients for her milk). You'll want to have the litter nearby too.<br>  <br>  But it won't take long for her to be up and about again. It's where the old expression "she gave birth as easy as a cat" comes from.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zv8QaMe1aa	Yes, put some food and water near her.... you may even offer her a bit of plain yogurt.. many cats love that and it's very good for their immune systems.  You can pick up bene-bac at the pet store for the kittens to boost their immune systems... follow the directions on the package.  Make sure she has a box to nest in with the kittens so that when they start trying to wander they don't end up underfoot and in danger.  I see you got the male neutered and plan on getting the Mamma spayed... that's good.... please do the same with the kittens as soon as they're big enough.... with millions of cats and kittens being killed every year in shelters and animal control units, you don't need to be adding to that.<br>  <br>  The last set of Momma and kittens I rescued I supplied the following....a cat pen, and in it...  a cat bed for Momma and the babies, kitten food and water nearby (the extra calories in kitten food are helpful to a nursing momma), a litterbox (with a divider next to it to make sure it was away from the food and water, bene-bac for the kittens, yogurt for Momma.... when the kittens got old enough to start tryng to eat solid food I gave them Royal Canin baby cat along with some wet kitten foods..... a scratcher on the inside of the pen, and plenty of toys as they grew enough to want to play.  Everybody is healthy and well and having a happy life in their new homes..... so it worked out fine.|`|AA11457471	Give her some really yummy canned food.<br>  Yes, you should leave her food & water close by.<br>  I'd also put a temporary litterbox in the room where she's at- at the other end.<br>  <br>  And, of course, have her spayed ASAP!
iJtuhLMTaa	Breeds are cropped for different reasons.  My breed, the Doberman, is a companion protector.   They were bred to have no loose skin or any type of excess for a would be human attacker to grab on to.   Cropping the ears and docking the tails removed the ears and tails as hand holds for a would be attacker also.   The erect ears is also better able to pinpoint sound which is an important characteristic in a protection breed.  <br>  <br>  Breeds like Great Danes, APBT, Dogo Argentino etc are breed to hunt wild boar or ask as catch dogs for wild for or bulls.  Floppy ears would be very prone to being torn by tusks or horns so they are cropped to prevent those injuries.   APBT and Dogo are both still commonly used as catch dogs by those that hunt wild boar with dogs.  <br>  <br>  Breeds like Beauceron and Bouvier des Flanders are continental herding breeds, meaning they not only heard the flock but protect them from predators.   The erect ear allows them to be better able to pinpoint sound.  <br>  <br>  As far as the flap of the ear protection the ear drum that is not the case.   The ear drum is well inside the ear and protected by the other structures of the ear just like yours is.   Almost all wild animals have erect ears, or open ear canals.  (including humans)   Floppy ears are due to human intervention.   The floppy ear traps debris and moisture in the ear making the dog more prone to infections.|`|Bw18seFqaa	in some breeds, it was done to prevent ear injuries while the dog was working, having an erect ear, as opposed to a floppy ear may also help with the dog's sence of hearing.<br>  <br>  In some breeds, it was also done to prevent the ear from being torn off during a fight.. if you notice when some breeds like pit bulls are cropped they leave very little of the ear flap.<br>  <br>  Most dogs today tho, its done for appearance only..  or for the historical aspect - the breed was originally cropped for work purpose, so the cropping is continued because its expected for the breed to look that way.<br>  <br>  <br>  the ear flaps do not protect the ear drums.. the ear drums are deep inside the ear canal and are protected because of where they are at.  Floppy eared dogs are actually more prone to ear infections, which can harm the ear drums!  The ear flaps hold in moisture and dont allow for air flow to keep the canal dry.|`|uD7giDNjaa	Its so that the ears don't get infected.<br>  <br>  It's not cruel, some dogs are really prone to ear infections and it's just better to have them cropped rather than put the Dog through the pain of ear infections.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's the same deal with why sheeps get thier tails cut off, so they Don't get infected!|`|p7oi3P06aa	i think that cropped ears on some dogs look cool. even though it may hurt (i don't know the process), it is only temporary. i don't think the dog remembers it because after they are cropped they are still as playful as before. <br>  <br>  i don't fight dogs (that's the worst crime in the world!) but i don't think that its for preventing the ears to get ripped off. i think since people bet on the fights, its for the look aspect. <br>  <br>  not every dog that has cropped ears fight, not by a long shot.|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	some people crop ears because that is the look they prefer on their dog. There are many actual and legitimate reasons to have it done, just like there are many actual and legitimate reasons to not have it done.|`|tTLg4u9laa	Same reason people get cosmetic surgery on themselves...all they care about is LOOKS.<br>  Ear cropping adjusts the dogs appearance, does nothing else, and people like this so they think they should be able to mutilate their dogs as they please.|`|146MzXiTaa	originally, yes.  dogs had their ears and tails cropped because they were the first things to get shredded in a fight<br>  <br>  today it's done mainly to make the dog look tough (i have an american staffordshire terrier...he weighs a little over 100 lbs and is all muscle, but he can look ridiculous sometimes with his floppy, uncropped ears) or simply because the owner prefers cropped ears.  <br>  <br>  another reason it's done is to prevent infection.  some breeds are prone to ear infection, and cropped ears reduce the chances.|`|06qcmahXaa	For people using dogs such as doberman, rottweiler, etc. for tracking or some similar activity, they crop the ears so that the dogs can have a keener sense of hearing. The regular dog owners crop their dog's ears because it makes the dog look intimidating for better guarding and personal interest.|`|17b8d68d2416136c4c415502cc901eeaaa	for some breeds, it's the breed standard to have cropped ears. i think it prevents flappy ears from getting caught on things while the dog is trying to do what it was bred to do...but the biggest reason people do it is just for looks/breed standard.|`|AA11044762	One word ..........IGNORANCE!!!
u65h6DN6aa	There are a couple of reasons why he could be refusing:<br>  <br>  1. Have you been cantering to the jump or just trotting? He may be refusing if he is not going fast enough.<br>  <br>  2. He got away with it once, and he knows he doesn't have to do it if you don't make him. Also this reflects your confidence in that he refused once, so you automatically assume he will keep refusing and he senses that in your hands and seat. Just keep thinking that you are going to jump it on the first attempt.<br>  <br>  3. He could be sore, get his back checked by a chiropractor<br>  <br>  4. Have you recently had a fall where you lost confidence? Because your fear from that fall could be pulsing through to him and he feels you hesitating when approaching a jump. To solve this, take lots of deep breaths and ride to the jump with your head up shoulders back and relax your hands<br>  <br>  If it is none of these things, try riding at the jump faster than you would normally do so, or as my trainer puts it "ride to a jump aggressively" which basically means that you are getting over that jump together, no matter what. Have that attitude on your mind, and keep him moving fast at it, you'll be suprised at what a difference it makes to your jumping. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|gbd4PMwfaa	I would make sure that he doesn't get jump sour. Try taking a break from jumping for a week or two and then see if he will do it. He could just want to do something else for a change. Try lowering your jumps or working over poles. I would make sure to always end on a good note though. If he won't go over one go over another, then stop and tell him good boy, because he did eventually do what you wanted. Good Luck.|`|RloOJ43haa	1. How do you know he is not in any pain?<br>  2. How do you know he is not bored of jumping?<br>  <br>  If a normally willing horse suddenly starts refusing, something has changed for him. My guess is that he is in pain and jumping hurts him. The jumping clearly hurts more than your crop/spurs because he is still refusing jumps despite your use of them.|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	sometimes horses refuse because they don't really understand what you're asking, and because they've been taught otherwise without the trainer or the rider knowing it. for example, maybe you accidentally pulled on the reins to slow him down and he thought he was supposed to stop? or because you keep whipping him and spurring him, he associates the jump with pain and is afraid to go near it? my advice to you is to work him, work him really hard, don't use spurs or a crop, and then ask him to go over the jump nice and easy. it will probably take a few tries to get him over, but if he refuses, then keep working him on the flat. make him think and sweat. then try the jump again. keep trying, until he goes over it, but don't use a whip or spurs. maybe let him see it close up beforehand too. then, when he finally goes over it, stop working him, praise him, and let him know what a good boy he is. you can try this multiple times, until he learns that he prefers going over the jump to working really hard. if you avoid whips and spurs while jumping, he may be happier.|`|76dfb34e84a5375f6ceb56a8f30f239faa	Well try taking off the spurs for a start! Or he will start associating the jump with pain and aggression!<br>  <br>  Maybe try jumping him on lunge or while freeschooling. Put up a small jump and jump over it with him to show him it is okay. if he jumps then it probably means there is something wrong with YOUR jumping NOT his! If he does still refuse then you might want to get him checked out to see that he is not in pain. <br>  Or maybe try giving him a break from jumping, work him hard on the flat, and then when you bring him back into jumping he will enjoy it more.<br>  Also you could try taking him out Xcountry, it is supposed to help horses as the jumps are low and wide to get them to open out a bit and have fun!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|b608c67e75221c1e151eb7fa81d3410caa	There are several schools of thought...He may be truly bored and worn out from repeated jumping. Put him through a series of poles on the ground, trotting poles, cantering poles. And let that be the extent of him jumping for several days. Take him on trail rides, horses get bored and show it in their actions.  The other thing I would be concerned about is pain that he might be in. If he is hurting, or has been hurt he is going to refuse. It might be as simple as a hot nail, (ask your farrier), or an abcess that hasn't fully developed yet. Give the guy a break. Be absolutely sure when you do jump to sit deep approaching the jump. If you jump ahead, that is a sure signal that he has the opportunity to stop.|`|dBRxfRGqaa	DEFINETLY stop using force. if you really want to have a great relationship, start taking charge and try to understand why. maybe he's refusing for a reason, like maybe somehow your position is causing him to brace, or maybe just once you did something wrong and he remembers it. I can't tell you exactly what to do because i can't see you, but i can tell you that whips and spurs are not the answer.|`|t4yBwlr6aa	It sounds like there MAY be a problem with your horse. Have a vet check him out as soon as possible. It could be a health issue or the horse may just be tired of jumping.

oUTb1zNkaa	Housing them together shouldnt be a problem. However I have kept many many species of snakes over the years, and without a doubt, House Snakes are one of the most aggressive feeding snakes I have ever seen. Separate them during feedings just to be safe.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	Some people like to stay far away from housing snakes together, others have no problem with it. I say if you're going to do it, be wise. Take into consideration the woman you get them from is a breeder. If you're going to do this, be sure you're getting two females. <br>  <br>  Quick math.<br>  <br>  Male + Male = This can be a bad plan, as they can often be quite territorial. You don't want one killing the other, or worse have them both end up dying<br>  <br>  Male + Female = babies! And you aren't quite ready for that!<br>  <br>  Make sure the tank you're housing them in is large enough for them both too. When it comes down to feeding, make sure it's done so seperatly! Good luck.
t78DA6Dpaa	Have tried both and found that Angel Eyes works the best. Took about one month to see results. But I've noticed if you quit using it abruptly the stain will come back but thankfully not as bad as before.

Maltese have a hereditary issue with their tear ducts so if not bred carefully they have tear stains usually.  Angel Eyes is the only eye product I have seen work well & Eye Envy is not the same product - it is a herbal based product if I remember correctly & doesn't contain the antibiotic to kill the bacterial.  If the eye start again, you can use the product once in a while to keep it for coming back You need to read their site for more info.
Zxg7SfN2aa	you actually could be doing more harm by NOT having him shaved<br>  who knows whats under them<br>  <br>  matts can pull the skin, and harbor all sorts of nasty things, especially if they get wet. <br>  they do not repel the water, they absorb it like a sponge, and keep it close to the skin. they also tighten when they dry <br>  <br>  get him shaved, then put a sweater on him and only let him out of the house to go potty|`|Bw18seFqaa	if he's kept indoors most of the time, it will be fine to shave him.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	You need to take this dog to a groomer.  He should not be in this condition with his coat felting into a matted mess. <br>  <br>  Matts on a dog pull the hair painfully and they itch constantly.  If the coat is in too much of a matted mess the dog may have to be sedated to shave him as it's traumatic for the dog.  We have had rescue dogs come in whose coats are far too matted to shave them without sedation. These poor dogs scream in pain without sedation and we find nests of fleas and other horrible things under all those matts.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing this little dog lives outside?   If so he needs a warm coat and please brush and comb him each day after the groomer fixes him up.

UeOtjPP5aa	Honestly, if spaying is not an option, the safest thing to do is to keep them separated. Rabbits, especially unspayed does, are extremely territorial and hormonal, and any attempts to bond two unspayed does should be avoided. The only time I have ever heard of two unaltered does living happily together were those that had been raised together from a young age; even those pairs tend to turn on each other once they reach puberty.<br>  <br>  Enjoy and love your bunnies, but for their safety, keep them separated.
AjX1cpAXaa	Follow your dream.  Get as much experience as you can now (I am assuming you are still at school) and learn all you can from people in your horsey world.  People do make a living (sometimes a good one) from training horses and riders or both.  But absolutely make sure you do your very best academically because sometimes you may need to do something else to bring in money and if you end up a successful horse trainer you will need a good business head as well.<br>  <br>  Go for it ... but get a good all around education as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	you have to be really skilled and understand horses a lot to be a trainer. that's not the only horse job though, heck no! if you can afford it later, you can buy yourself a barn (it doesn't have to be big) and have a boarding facility, and continue expanding as you get more horses. you can also be a horse breeder, but you'd have to learn a lot about breeding and such. you could be a riding instructor, you'd have to be certified but it's an option, or a stable hand. you don't have to manage your own barn but you can be an assistant for a trainer or something. there's TONS of things you can do related to horses. <br>  <br>  other ideas could be working in a tack shop. this sounds lame but theres a HUGE tack store near where i live and they're really big, and they also help you fit tack and equipment. Literally, you back the trailer up to the one back door and unload your horse to the fitting area, and staff members help you chose the right saddle or blanket or whatever. you could do something like that, if you're desperate ;)<br>  <br>  good luck! i hope this helps! and NEVER give up your dream just because of what someone else says.|`|t4yBwlr6aa	To be a trustworthy, and good trainer requires GREAT skill in ALL breeds of horses and all styles of riding, if it's something that you're willing to learn everything about.... i don't see why you couldn't do it.

If you're worried about getting hurt and won't have alot of time to devote to each horse, i would consider looking into another profession. There are TONS of other jobs that involve horses.

They blame their trainers for everything and yet they interfere with your training.

ivH8tRtsaa	You are not being paranoid. Find an emergency animal clinic and get there. Parvo is survivable if you act quickly. Your vet is irresponsible for not squeezing you into the schedule, a little heartless too. Sometimes the person answering the phone is qualified to do just that. I had a german shepperd that got parvo. He survived. He had to stay at the vet for two nights. They have to hydrate and supply antibiotics intravenously. No time to waste. Please hurry. The younger the puppy, the more susceptible they are to dying from parvo. If you love it and want to keep it, get help. If I am wrong, so be it, but let a vet be the judge.|`|AA12300560	I would say there is definitely something wrong, maybe try calling some other vets in the area and see if you can an appointment. It could be something other than parvo though, my puppy had similar symptoms and it turned out just to be a stomach virus and he was giving a couple pills and a gel type medicine and has been fine since. Good luck, hope hes ok. -Jess|`|yXUS7jz5aa	Try another vet your pup is very sick.|`|AA11887983	This is definitely a reason to see an emergency vet.  Your vet may not have had any appointments, but your pet needs to be seen.  I don't think you are being paranoid.  He is sick.  He needs to be checked out, and get treatment for whatever is causing the diarrhea. <br>  <br>  As an aside, I have never understood vet clinics that won't see sick pets that belong to good clients, even if they are booked for the day.  I mean, isn't that what we are supposed to treat?  Or are we supposed to cater to giving vaccines and doing routine surgeries only?  I think that if my doctor couldn't see me when I was sick, I would probably find a new doctor.  The same should go for your pet, as far as I am concerned.|`|Bw18seFqaa	the puppy should be seen ASAP.. if your vet can schedule him in, then call another vet!|`|dZtToTIbaa	You're vet should have brought your puppy in immediately regardless of appointment availability.  That is a very serious condition.  If your puppy isn't better by tomorrow then get it to a vet ASAP.  These are signs of parvo, some of which you have already explained your puppy having...<br>  <br>  Lethargic. If your dog normally likes to play and has high energy, this is the clearest sign that something is wrong. You could say they act depressed. <br>  Lack of Appetite. The more common strains attack the digestive system. <br>  Vomiting with no change in diet. It usually looks clear and foamy. <br>  Bloody Diarrhea. <br>  Stronger Feces Odor. Itâs unmistakable and you will never forget it. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!|`|339NqJ84aa	You should take your pup in tomarrow, paranoid...I figure its better to be safe then sorry.

h6m94ydgaa	Try getting some toys thats harder to destroy, like maybe the kong hard rubber toys. You can buy a spray also to spray on things he is prone to chewing on. It comes in several different name brands. It dont really have a odor so you cant smell it but has a horrible taste. Keep lots of toys in the room with him if he is confined to one room for a long period of time. Good luck.|`|Mw49Vjs6aa	First, go back to crate training her.  She can't be trusted when given free run of your place.  The smaller area of a crate makes it more like a natural cave or den than the larger space of a bathroom, and therefore feels safer and more secure to the dog.  <br>  <br>  Next, make sure she is receiving adequate exercise and mental stimulation.  Chewing, tail chasing, pacing, barking and many other obsessive behaviors start because the dog is bored, become intrinsically rewarding because they do relieve the boredom, and then become ingrained into the dogs behavioral repertoire.<br>  <br>  Finally, have your dog's teeth checked by your vet to see if she is chewing to relieve dental pain or discomfort.  If her teeth are fine, consider having her evaluated by a certified canine behaviorist or behavioral veterinarian for canine obsessive compulsive disorder.  If so, removing all corn (maize) from her diet, frequently changing her environment, and lots of exercise can all go a long way toward managing the disorder.|`|596ba0725523b654ae88f9a7d31dae51aa	They sell a sour apple spray that is supposed to keep dogs from chewing. Also I have heard that cayenne pepper works well. I used a mix of the two on my electrical cords.|`|DnnHqgwGaa	I had a dog like that and I tried so many ways to make him stop (eventually he did). I will only mention five. First, I crate trained him. He was doing well but when he stopped, he went back to his old self. Next, I checked his teeth because maybe he's chewing of pain. Nothing was wrong. If there was something wrong, I would've let the vet treat it. Then, I bought him a really hard toy that can't be destroyed. He liked it, and then abandoned it soon. After that, I got a sour apple spray. I sprayed it on him when he chewed something. He stopped for a while. Finally, I got so annoyed with him that I just treated him so badly until he got the message and stopped. Just do any of the ways and keep on trying until you're done with all. Good luck! :)

HJa7cVFMaa	There is no set, or predetermined length as to what they should be. But the rule is that if you offer the hamster a treat, or some food, then he should be able to take it from you comfortably gripping it with his teeth. If he is able to do that, then the teeth are fine. The front incisor teeth are continuously growing through out the life of the hamster.<br>  The hamster manages quite well in keeping the teeth in trim. They naturally receive continuous wear as the upper and lower contact each other, this prevents overgrowth. <br>  Some people do say place a piece of wood (chew stick) in the cage for them to gnaw on. I find many hamsters donât use them; they seem to prefer the cage bars, or plastic to gnaw on. <br>  The only problem that may arise is one of malocclusion, meaning the teeth are not rubbing together naturally when feeding.<br>  However, if a problem is essentially one of malocclusion, then regular teeth clipping may be required. There are no blood vessels or nerves in hamstersâ teeth, clipping is a very quick and painless process.<br>  <br>  Hamster Breeder|`|PdYlfeeaaa	Try the various kinds of chew sticks at the pet store to find out which one he'll like.

xGmbEzOZaa	First, thank you for taking your bird to the veterinarian. Many people tend to ignore giving budgies (parakeets) medical care when the birds need it. Yes, birds should not appear fluffed up all the time. It is a sign of illness. The only time that should happen is if the weather has become suddenly cold and the bird needs to trap air within its feathers to keep its body warm.<br>  <br>  I'm surprised that your veterinarian only recommended to provide food and water. Your bird appears to be quite ill from the symptoms you describe. The shaky movements and "pulled in" appearance is definitely not normal. He may be suffering from a respiratory illness or bacterial infection. Those are quite common illnesses for budgies. I would recommend that you contact your veterinarian, describe your bird's symptoms, and request an antibiotic.<br>  <br>  For now, supply a heat lamp near your budgie's cage (90 degrees Fahrenheit is good). Heat usually helps put a sick bird on the road to recovery.|`|1gDTiPVyaa	It really sounds like your bird is too hot or extremely upset about something.  I've never had this particular problem, so the only ideas I've got you may take with a grain of salt.  You might go to birds-online.de and see if you see anything that gives you a better idea of what's going on. There's a "droppings as indicator of illness" page that's fairly useful and some good descriptions of other symptoms of various illnesses.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you took your bird to the vet. I hope you don't have to look for another one further away, but you might want to be prepared for that.  Best of luck to you.|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	My birds pull in their feathers and raise their wings away from the body when they are hot. That is only time they do that and should do that.<br>  Anyway your bird is feeling warmer than usual? <br>  <br>  Also, for a parakeet to be healthy it requires flying. Just because your scared the bird might run into trouble does not mean that you should prevent the bird from doing what it needs. Please get a playpen/stand and let the bird come out and WATCH him the hour or so you let your bird out. That way your happy and the bird is too.<br>  <br>  For now though....give the bird the AB just in case. But, your bird just sounds upset at something. Can you think of any changes to it's surroundings? And again see if the bird is hot.<br>  <br>  That is all you can do. And hopefully by letting the bird out and spending time with it might help the bird strech like it should and this might help the bird.|`|9NrjExV9aa	Sorry, but I don't think the vet was an avian certified vet... If he just told you to feed her food and give her water. If you're not going to take her to the closest avian vet, at least call them and ask for their opinion...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aav.org/vet-lookup/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aav.org/vet-lookup/</a>|`|DvjbTNXvaa	I'm completely shocked that ur vet only told u to give him lots of food and water!!!!<br>  i think u better take him to another vet.<br>  try taking him out and leaving him out in a closed small room at least for some time.maybe he is in pain, so gently stretch out his wingsand see if there is any injury . if he starts to make noise, his wings might be hurting.
4SQx8smEaa	The egg..|`|OrvTG44laa	The chicken, obviously.  Chickens are needed to produce eggs.  In the theory of evolution, some animal slowly evolved into what is now a chicken.  That chicken laid an egg, and it kept happening.  Even from a religious view, people believe God put chickens on earth.  So either way, chickens had to come first.<br>  Also, chickens need to lay on the eggs for them to hatch.  If the egg came first, there would be no chicken to lay on the eggs, obviously.  So the chicken had to come first.|`|nHp8zzkjaa	The egg and here is my reasoning.<br>  The chicken was the mutation of another animal. That animal laid an egg that had a mutated baby in it. These mutated babies had more mutated babies and Tada the chicken was created over years of mutation that started with an egg that hatched from another animal.|`|ws4c4GDgaa	Chicken because if the egg came first who produced it, did it fall out of the sky and who would help it hatch?

ELbs3Dpwaa	Could be sensitive to the bedding.<br>  Avoid using pine and cedar as they cause problems for them.<br>  <br>  Use CareFresh.|`|44kEtDvIaa	It's possible.  They can also be senstitive to perfumes, room deodorizers and after shave, among other things.  Depending on how long you've have your pet, it could be stress induced.  Rats don't take well to change.  New rats in your home could sneeze for week or more until they get used to the surroundings.  If you've moved their cage or changed homes, this could also be stress for them.  As long as is eating and acting normal, sneezes should stop in couple of days, but you can try a change in bedding.<br>  <br>  Site below has more info on rats, plus other rodent sites you may want to check out for care, handling, feeding and health issues.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Yes they can! Try shredded newspaper|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	I would definitely change your bedding.<br>  <br>  Sawdust and woodshavings are very dusty, and the dust can irritate rodents noses. <br>  Sofwoods (pine and cedar) are also dangerous anyway, because they contain high levels of phenols which can cause respiratory and liver disease.<br>  <br>  I would suggest switching to something like Carefresh or Megazorb.<br>  <br>  If a little while after you switch beddingsyour rat still sneezes a lot I would suggest taking him to a vet.|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i don't know if it's specifically allergic to saw dust, but the saw dust has such small fragments in it and gets sent through the air<br>  it might just be getting in its nose and causing a sneeze<br>  <br>  i'm not allergic to baby powder but if i got a bunch of it up my nose i bet i would sneeze<br>  <br>  remember the rat is a lot smaller than us big folks, so a small bit of any kind of dust will potentially make the rat sneeze|`|dwhClJ1Haa	aaaw. I'm sorry, but I really doubt it. Many pets sneeze for no reason. If you like, you could try changing the bedding into carefresh. It's amazing and absorbent.|`|yn37MLwnaa	Probably. Rats, as well as other rodents, do not always do all that well on wood shavings. It is very dusty and can cause allergies. It may also be mycoplasma, which is sort of like a cold. Most rats have it, its a bacteria that lives in their respiratory system. Allergens, such as dust, can cause myco to flare up, which causes them to sneeze, and in some cases they will get red "porphyrin" (snot) staining around their eyes and nose. This can turn into full out wheezing, and eventually death, in extreme cases (which isn't uncommon). I would take him off of the sawdust and put him on something like carefresh ultra, which has very little dust. If he still sneezes, and it seems to bother him, bring him to a vet that has seen many rats before.<br>  <br>  If he is super active and eats a lot, he'll probably be fine, as long as you keep that sneezing to a minimum.<br>  <br>  Hope he stops sneezing soon :) have fun with your wonderful little animal.|`|UlOKMInqaa	Saw dust is an awful option for rat bedding. It really irritates their respiratory system and is not good for them. A better option is a product called "Eco Bedding". It's recycled shredded paper. It's very absorbant and dries quickly. Another good product is "Carefresh".|`|OrvTG44laa	Wood dust is bad for rats and can give them respiratory problems.

KfxLWlfjaa	Face your fears and play with a neighbor dog,or even a shelter dog. Hope it helped!|`|ydshiNrKaa	You need to seek some counseling for this anxiety you are feeling.|`|q7GBzr6yaa	A 1992 study of cynophobia among children and adults [1] reported that actually experiencing dog attacks does contribute to cynophobia. On the other hand, early harmless exposure to dogs seems to hamper conditioning that can lead to fear of dogs. Small children are more susceptible to acquiring this fear. Pediatrical psychologists explain that gradual exposure to dogs may help to prevent the development of cynophobia.<br>  <br>  Treatment for cynophobia is similar to treatment for other specific phobias.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Natural fear<br>  Traditionally dogs are hunters, guardians and warriors, rather than pets, therefore a certain amount of healthy fear is reasonable, and dogs, especially unfamiliar ones, must be approached with precaution.[2]<br>  <br>  It is not advised to come close to unfamiliar dogs, even if they are small and tied. A large tied dog may reach farther than you may expect, while a small one may feel threatened and cornered (being tied, it cannot escape) and hence can bite in defense. Small kids must be absolutely forbidden to approach to unfamiliar dogs (even small ones) without most immediate supervision. Small children may rush to a dog and try to grab it (especially having and experience with a home pet), and thus trigger a defensive reaction from a dog.<br>  <br>  One must be aware of kinds of behavior a dog may perceive as threatening: direct eye contact, touching it over is head, approaching it too quickly, taking from a dog something valuable to it, e.g., a bone or a dog's toy, standing over a dog. Signs of dog's agitation include growling, raised hackles, shown teeth, erect or slightly vibrating (as opposed to wagging side to side) tail.<br>  <br>  One must not run away from a dog accidentally run into: this will trigger the predatory response and most probably the chase follows. It is advised to stand still, not making eye contact, and turn slowly away.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Unnatural Fear<br>  Cynophobia is the unnatural fear of dogs.It can range from a paralysing terror at the upper end down to an easily managed discomfort in the presence of a dog.<br>  <br>  It is more widespread than is generally believed, being mostly undiagnosed and unacknowledged. It is thought to be a contributing factor to the many complaints about normal canine behaviour, especially normal barking.<br>  <br>  The symptoms may include an elevated heartrate; sweating of the palms; and feelings of anxiety. If a sufferer is exposed over an extended period of time to irregular barking from a dog in their close vicinity the anxiety may build into on-going anger towards the dog and its owners and/or towards dogs and dog-owners in general.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, in common with most phobias, cynophobia responds well to professional treatment|`|FJ3U0jIPaa	try to first go to a place where they have kind dogs that r undercontrolled so u wont get hurt and play with them thinking that they r nothing but ur friends and then go and face ur fears|`|zFsBCsiCaa	consult a psychologist, they can get you where you want to be

If not that could be the reason. chihuahuas tend to be very vocal also. In terms of aggression, I would start training him now. I know chihuahuas are small and easily portable- easy to just pick up or ignore when it bites at you, but think about what it would be like if it was a larger breed puppy? If you didn't train it when it was young, it would probably become/continue to be aggressive as a large adult dog, and that is definitely not good. Its easy to not train small dogs correctly; many people don't. See if yo can find a training class or hire a private trainer. There are also trainers that specialize in aggression.|`|d17q3XdCaa	Well first of all, 8 wks is too young to be away from mom & other siblings. Puppies at this stage are still learning a whole heck of alot from mom about being a good boy/girl.<br>  Usually, most pups stay with mom until 10-12 wks.<br>  So, when the puppy tries to bite or gets a little rough, ignore it and walk away EVERY time it does it. This is what mom & siblings do. They learn that biting and being too rough is not a good thing.<br>  Play gently with it while it's this young. Love on it and it will calm down.<br>  <br>  Blessings!|`|FJ3U0jIPaa	yes you shuold bring ur puppy to a vet and let her have shots such as rabies cuz u sed he growls so he mite bite animals too and he can get a temper shot i had a dog , same thing happend and it worked!!|`|I9QTRDfhaa	no it is instinct now answer mine<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjFlL8DPOp88HvKkEUk9mRsjzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306220357AAFR7nT">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|OJIMRRN4aa	To caress it and not to beat to him in the osico so that one becomes but brave
13xTQ5lsaa	Sneezing and a stuffy nose are not common symptoms of allergies in dogs - allergy symptoms are itching, chewing/ licking on the paws,stomach and hindquarters, and sometimes hives or rashes.  It sounds more like your dogs are sick.  Dogs rarely have "nasal" allergies like people (sneezing can happen sometimes - but the stuffy/snotty nose thing points more to an illness.)  You will need to take them to a vet to find out what is wrong or confirm if it is indeed allergies.  <br>  <br>  On another note, Benadryl is safe for dogs - the dosage is up to 1mg per pound of dog every 8 hours - but not to exceed 2mg per pound in 24 hours (so only given twice a day.).  However, Benadryl can make dogs incredibly drowsy, so you are better off getting something specifically for dogs from your vet (and definitely get confirmation of what is going on first!)  Claritin is not approved for dogs - it is too new to have been tested thoroughly on dogs and Claritin D contains a drug (pseudoephedrine) known to be toxic to dogs.|`|AA11457471	NOOO!<br>  Don't assume your dogs are suffering from the same thing you are- especially since both are effected!<br>  PLEASE take them to the vet to be checked out.<br>  <br>  Half a Benadryl? Where did you hear that? They are always dosed at ?mg. per pound!<br>  Careful...having only half the necessary info can be DEADLY!|`|VX4aaUS6aa	No do not give your puppy claritin! Do the benedrly by pounds...and take your dog to the vet...there they can give your puppy something for its allergies...i have a dog with allergies and i give it a kenelog shot every six weeks or so and relieves him of all his symptoms.|`|sgxw5GDzaa	My dog had alot of allergies and we did give her benedryl but the best we found was from the vet.  It was pretazone inexpensive and it was a wonder drug for my westie.
tPGxPDvBaa	yes but not easily.  They are deep chested dogs & it is hard for them to keep their head above water. & float & swim well.  Most would not be happy to get in deep water but maybe play in shallow end.|`|SohrsIBoaa	no, there too heavy.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Yes Danes can swim and many are very good swimmers. Some don't like the water so won't swim and other don't like deep water but will play in shallow water.<br>  <br>  One of my past Danes was raised with our Lab pups (who at the time we were training to retreive in water for hunting & field work) and not only swam but retreived in water as well. She had no idea she wasn't a Lab.|`|p7oi3P06aa	i think all dogs can swim. but obviously some swim better than others. basset hounds shouldn't be around deep water, and in the water for long. they have such a big body and small legs. but great danes i don't see why not!<br>  <br>  i could be wrong, but i'm pretty sure they can!|`|ydshiNrKaa	Most dogs can swim but some of them have to be taught how to swim.|`|UETAqR8Taa	absolutely! as a hunting dog, they swim for the catch|`|339NqJ84aa	I don't see why not.<br>  <br>  The only dogs who are really bad swimmers are dogs like the bulldogs/frenchies because their heads and chests are way heavier then their backside and its hard to for them to keep their head above water.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Its ok..gimme all the thumbs down you want.

cmNQJjEbaa	Yupp that does sound like neurological problems.  <br>  <br>  He might have a lliver shunt. My first maltese puppy did and the vet said blindness is a symptom and the sight can come back and just leave again(if that makes any sense!) Walking weird is also a symptom.<br>  Unfortunately as a result of the high demand of yorkshire terriers in America, Yorkies are 36 times more prone to getting liver shunts than ANY other breed of dog, due to the multiple poorly bred yorkies over many generations(puppymills are full of them!)  <br>  <br>  I would go to the vet and get a bile acids test ASAP! Don't worry it's not expensive.|`|AA11457471	I assume if you are administering meds he was seen by a vet.<br>  Was his blood pressure checked? Sounds like he may have had a stroke.<br>  What did the vet diagnose?<br>  <br>  Healthy dogs DO NOT just go blind!!!|`|AA11887983	Have your vet check him out, and if he was already seen earlier, get him checked again.  There are quite a few things that can be going on, but on here, we are really just providing ideas. <br>  <br>  I would think that it could be neurologic in origin, because it does sound as if he may have had a seizure earlier today.  At his age, if he did have a seizure, unfortunately the most common cause would be a brain tumor.  Strokes do happen, but the dog is not usually back to normal so soon. <br>  <br>  There are a few other conditions where a dog may go blind relatively fast, like SARD, which is retinal degeneration.  The best thing to do is help keep your dog calm, and check with your vet.  Then you can have a better idea of why your dog cannot see.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	A  dog does not go  blind overnight it is a physical,medical impossibility.You have most likely not noticed that he may have been coming down with cataracts or he may have a type of glaucoma which is rare in dogs..This is NO reflection on you as cataracts creep up on animals and most pet owners do not even realize that their dog has them unless you are  looking for it specifically.Remember your dog is not young although in general Yorke's can live to 17 years of age but in some lines they do have hereditary eye problems which are hereditary so depending where you bought this dog will indicate if it already had a predisposition for blindness..<br>  Sometimes when a dog has a type of mini stroke which is exactly what you are describing they do this type of behaviour but the stroke itself would not blind the dog permanently so l would take him to a vet to have the dog checked thoroughly and then you will know where you stand and what has to ve done.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Ok, so when he was doing all this staggering, acting confused, and vomiting, you didn't think it might be a good idea to take him to the vet.|`|YNj7oGBUaa	Vet now he may have had a stroke in his sleep.|`|Bw18seFqaa	take him to a vet..  sounds like a neurological problem.|`|rmSdDT5Faa	the only answer to give you would be to take it to a vet, they are the only one that can truly help you with the problem you have noone on here can give you a definite answer..............|`|t4yBwlr6aa	Take him to the vet as soon as possible, it could be MANY things....

IuYekkPVaa	Cats squat to urinate, but when they spray, they back-up to a vertical surface, raise their tail, whilst standing on tip-toe to raise their rump and ensure the urine is released as high as possible.  Spraying is almost always done to mark territory because it's done at cat nose level and is designed to be noticed by other cats.<br>  <br>  Neutered cats of both sexes are capable of spraying when they feel anxious.  It's often because they feel worried that their territory is under threat, or there are changes going on around them which they are having difficulty coping with.  If you are absolutely sure that no cats other than your own are able to access that area, then you need to think of reasons why they might feel stressed.  Are there any stray cats or wildlife hanging around which might make yours feel intimidated?  Are there any roadworks or building work taking place locally, as loud noises can sometimes trigger marking behaviour. To stop spraying, you need to identify the source of the stress and either reduce or alleviate it.   <br>  <br>  If you're unsure which of your two cats is the culprit, there is a fluorescent marker dye from the vet which can be put in food and which comes out in urine.  This can help detect which cat is doing it. <br>  <br>  This web site has a really good article on spraying and how to treat the behaviour.  It also has a useful check list of 18 reasons why a cat might feel stressed or unhappy enough to begin marking territory.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20problems/cats/frameset.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...</a><br>  <br>  Don't use bleach for cleaning.  It smells like urine to a cat and will just prompt your cat to cover the "other cat" scent by marking it with his/her own.  You can use biological (enzymatic) washing detergent mixed with warm water for cleaning up, and the web site above has advice on how to do this.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Many cat owners are puzzled when their cats start to pee all over the house. It can be quite a nightmare trying to remove the smell of cat pee! But more importantly, you may be very worried that your cat is having some ill health or disease.<br>  <br>  Before you get sick with worry (or overly frustrated), do take a minute to see if your cat is having a medical peeing problem or if your cat is in fact spraying to mark its territory.<br>  <br>  You can tell the difference between a cat's normal peeing and spraying by this:<br>  <br>  If your cat is peeing normally, it would squat to do it and this usually lasts for a few seconds. However, if it is spraying, it would give out a short quick spurt of urine at different parts of the house (and this is usually done standing).<br>  <br>  There is always some trigger that causes a cat to spray. Usually, it has to do with a feeling of insecurity and anxiety that your cat is having. Some common triggers are:<br>  <br>  1) A new cat or another pet has been introduced into the family<br>  2) A new baby has arrived in the family<br>  3) A visitor is staying over at the home<br>  4) A new partner/spouse to the cat owner<br>  5) New stray cats in the neighborhood<br>  6) Stray cats entering the house<br>  7) If you have always had a cuddly relationship with your cat but now you don't have the time to spend quality time with it because you are busy or your cat is left at home alone more often than in the past.<br>  <br>  If you identify any of these triggers as possible causes of your cat peeing, then focus on removing the triggers or taking more time to shower love on your cat so that it feels secure and less anxious. If removing the triggers still does not work, you may need to consult a cat behaviorist for help.<br>  <br>  Here are some signs to help you determine if your cat has a medical cat pee problem:<br>  <br>  1) Smelly urine accompanied by blood. Cat may be peeing much more frequently than normal or it has trouble holding in urine. It may also be licking the vulva or penis.<br>  <br>  2) Large quantities of urine. Cat is experiencing excessive thirst, mouth ulcers, weight loss, bad breath, anaemia or vomiting<br>  <br>  3) If it's a male cat and it's straining to pee, accompanied by vomiting and mournful howling<br>  <br>  4) If it's a young animal and it's pee is very pale. It is also having difficulty growing and strengthening itself.<br>  <br>  One or more of these signs could signal kidney and bladder stones and infections. If your cat is showing any of these signs, it is urgent that you bring your cat to a vet immediately.|`|AA11887983	Are you sure that no other cats are getting in?  It may be that there is a new cat in the area,  and one of your cats feels like marking the territory as his/hers.  <br>  <br>  It may be brought in the house, but it may not. Check with your vet for the best advice based on your cats and their environment.|`|vEBfp8yHaa	Only male cats mark like that and usually when they aren't neutered.  My cat used to do that and as soon as we got him fixed, he stopped.  take your cat to the doctor - mybe the procedure wasn;t done properly.|`|vLkS8Cwzaa	Well, in my part of the world, it's getting warm, and that means the tomcats are "booty calling." They spray to mark their territory and to warn off other males. Chances are it's a neighborhood tom who has chosen your shed as his turf. If it's your indoor male (not likely, but possible), then he's getting a whiff of other cats and feels the need to mark his turf for himself.<br>  <br>  There is some pheromone neutralizer on the market, don't know how well it works.
u3Hdoeiqaa	Aspen is fine :-)<br>  <br>  Softwoods (cedar and pine) contain high levels of phenols, which are known to cause respiratory and liver disease and may also cause allergic skin reactions. Cedar is the worst. Some people believe kiln-dried pine is okay, although there is no evidence it is any better and personally I wouldn't risk it.<br>  <br>  Safe beddings include hardwoods (eg aspen), paper based beddings (eg Carefresh and Megazorb) or hemp (eg Aubiose).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|OrvTG44laa	No, wood bedding can't be used.  Pine, cedar and aspen bedding are all bad.  Use carefresh bedding or just use an old shirt or a towel.|`|JxmJg37Iaa	just shred some newspaper its cheaper, make sure its soybased though|`|3sB49YNnaa	Aspen is fine and so is pine as long as it is not dusty.  If pine is not ok, somebody forgot to tell the dozens of generations of pigs we've raised on pine over better than 40 years.  You want pine with a nice curl and little or no dust.  Sawdust made from any wood in not ok. Avoid the really big chips because they don't absorb well.   You are correct to avoid ceder.<br>  <br>  The other alternatives like care fresh, yesterday's news and pellet wood or paper also work well but are hugely more expensive than wood shavings bought in bulk.|`|AA11887983	I actually like Carefresh pet bedding. It doesn't stick to the animal, and it does pretty well at absorbing odor.
FC34jxiaaa	It's not actually hereditary, but it can be contracted from an infected mother in utero, through milk, or through saliva. If the brother contracted the virus from his mother (or even if he didn't), then it's likely that his sister is also infected. I'm sorry.|`|AA11457471	If your cats go in & out he could possibly have gotten it elsewhere but if they've been strictly indoors she most likely has it, too.<br>  It's a virus that's passed from cat to cat including a mother to her kittens.<br>  Best wishes & good luck!|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Feline Virus Infection <br>   feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is one of the most common and destructive of all cat viruses. It is highly contagious and is spread primarily by saliva during cat fights, grooming or mating. The virus is also spread by blood, urine and feces. Kittens may become infected while still in the womb, during birth or during nursing. <br>  <br>  Not all cats exposed to FeLV become infected. About 40 percent of exposed cats have immune systems that destroy the invading virus. The remainder of exposed cats become persistently infected (30 percent) or develop a latent infection (30 percent). <br>  <br>  The latter group has inactive virus in the bone marrow, and these virus particles may later become active when the cat becomes ill from another disease, stress or certain drugs. <br>  <br>  Of the cats persistently infected, about 25 percent will die within one year and 75 percent will die within three years. Some may live a normal life but tend to have various chronic illnesses. <br>  <br>  There are no signs specific for FeLV infection. The main effect of the virus is to disrupt the cat's immune system. While anemia is the most common disorder caused by the virus, cancer and various other diseases are common. <br>  <br>  Disorders commonly associated with FeLV infection include chronic respiratory disease; chronic infection of the mouth, gums and tongue; chronic eye disease; frequent or chronic skin disease; disease (abortion, stillbirths and kitten deaths); frequent or chronic urinary tract infections; chronic digestive tract disease; and other systemic diseases (infectious peritonitis, hemobartonellosis, toxoplasmosis, polyarthritis).|`|4aAhEK9daa	Yes - most likely as they've probably had it since birth.  If the mother cat has it it's passed on to their kittens because it's a blood disease.  And if the cat that died contracted it from another cat because you allowed him to free roam, it's very likely he's infected the other cat through his saliva when they shared the same bowls.  <br>  <br>  Take the other cat to the vet and get it tested.  It's a very inexpensive test that gives immediate results whether the cat is positive or not.|`|6eqJSffkaa	You have lots of great answers here so just to add:<br>  <br>  I found a support forum for feline leukemia which I shall be using myself.  I very much hope your cat is not infected but should you find that she is tested positive for the disease, you will find lots of help there.<br>  <br>  I've also given a link to veterinary information and advice in herbal and homeopathic remedies, to help heal and keep your cat healthy, whether or not she has the disease.
0tKNkAMuaa	yes i agree with you. the poor puppy's who are being adopted then put back into the SPCA or pound. its very sad.|`|AA11457471	Are you asking or telling?|`|44kEtDvIaa	Shows a lack of responsibility.  Guess it's same reasons they buy the pet and then get rid of them 6 months later when they find out he's bigger than they thought, or too hyper, or whatever they weren't expecting.<br>  <br>  Funny, isn't it ... people do a lot of research on almost everything they buy except pets.|`|h7F4wA7eaa	Yeah some people see a cute puppy and make an impulse purchase and have issues with the dog later on!<br>  <br>  When I was a kid of friends of mine wanted a puppy so badly he wen tto a place called Just puppies and he and his mom bought the puppy that was the lowest price.<br>  She was a Border collie, he named her Jazzi we were all living in a suburban neighborhood.<br>  Jazzi was the most active collie I have ever seen and I saw that if Border Collies energy isn't channeled right it can result in bad behavior.<br>  Jazzi didn't get all the outside time she needed to burn enough energy, so one day a little boy was playing with a football and he started running Jazzi bolted out of my friends yard and attacked the little boy leaving little chunks of skin and tissue from the back of his legs hanging out, sadly my friends was in his house and I was the only one outside I screamed to little boy stop running and screaming.<br>  I was running after him and when I caught up to him and I had to push him to the ground and I jumped on top of him because I knew Jazzi wasn't going to bite me she loves me more than my friend(her owner).<br>  The boy (6years old) had to go to the hospital and Jazzi had to be quarantined in my friends house for 19 days after that Jazzi is still with my friend as of today but that little boy has forever been terrified of dogs!<br>  But since my friend just made an impulse buy on Jazzi he didn't research about BC's and he didn't know they are herding dogs and need to be living a farm life where they can herd animals Jazzi treated that little boy like a sheep and when he kept running away she did what any other herding dog would when a sheep didn't go the way the dog wanted it to nip at the legs!<br>  So because my friends poor judgment it caused a little boy to forever be scared physically and emotionally by a dog.<br>  Dont get me wrong Jazzi is a wonderful dog but she didn't get the farm life her breed needs!|`|qgeI6Chxaa	I think people expect every dog to be exactly the same, just in different sizes and colors.

Many people are just to full of themselves to have any sense of right or wrong or commitment or responsibility.<br>  <br>  You are entirely correct, the most important thing is that a dog is well matched to our own real energy level, not the energy level we might falsely attribute to ourselves.  The dog will not change most people, and a Border Collie with a couch potato owner will be nothing but an unhappy dog. <br>  <br>  Different breeds present different challenges, not all are good starter dogs.  No inexperienced handler should ever be looking at prey dogs, or even herd dogs for that matter.  These breeds take more knowledge and more commitment.<br>  <br>  Those who want a dog for decor and status should look into something in porcelain or fine china, or crystal, those who want dogs for the bed should get a stuffed animal.|`|t4yBwlr6aa	B/c they see a cute puppy and have to take it home with them before researching the breed.

vLkS8Cwzaa	Not true, not always. If she's comfortable with you then she might be okay with you handling her babies. But, you take a risk disturbing her, especially in the first few hours. I'd leave the comforter where it is for now and let her do her thing. Sometimes the best thing to do in this situation is just check on her and let her take care of herself for a while. As long as she has food, water, and a litter box close by, she's okay.|`|t4yBwlr6aa	No that's not true... you just want to make SURE that the cat knows what you're doing and that you're not trying to hurt her or her young. Good Luck and hope i've helped !|`|ybaeu04Baa	I would just make sure she can see you with her babies.  Do not take them out of the room or anything!  So, basically if you want to cuddle with them sit next to her and move slowly.|`|KIGhVitOaa	be gentle and make sure she knows that ur helping instead of harming.<br>  she has to know u well before u can touch her kittens|`|AA11457471	No, but handle them as little as possible.<br>  I'm sure she'd appreciate clean bedding.|`|hwHJ1vzCaa	No, that's not true.

fOLO4TNhaa	Nope its fine. Innova EVO is a GREAT dog food! I don't see a problem in it. Somethings came up and you cant afford Raw anymore. Things happen unfortunately but in your case your getting high quality food so there is nothing bad about it.|`|VX4aaUS6aa	No, honestly it is probably better to feed them regular dog food...the eat food diet sounds good but isn't always best for your animals...they should be fine eating the Innova...don't worry you didn't do the wrong thing...6 animals is a lot to feed...and it is great that some of them are rescues!|`|PM23RDycaa	Not at all. You are doing what's best for your situation and your wallet. Nothing to feel guilty about.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	No you did the right thing. If you can't afford to keep up with it, whats the point. This is stressful times for everyone economically wise. My only problem with EVO has been expressed before. Its not good for every dog, just cause its no grain doesnt make it the best. Lots of dogs can't handle that high of protein, i mean 50% almost is ridiculous. It causes lots of dogs to get sick. EVO really is made for high energy dogs that get the exercise to burn it off. Most won't agree with me on that, but it is actually the truth, that much amount of protein a day can start to shut down the kidneys and liver because they have to work double time to burn it off. Just because some stupid rating site gives it a good rating based off of nothing scientific or no personal experience doesnt actually mean its good for every dog.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Of course not. While a raw diet is a great choice, it's just not feasible sometimes. Expense and convenience does have to be taken into account. Now, if you switched from raw to Eukanuba, you'd have done the wrong thing. ;-)|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	You have no shame this are harsh times for nearly everyone but the 5% who are wealthy.   To an animal what is far more important then what you feed them or what brand of dog food you give them. Is simple that you love them and provide them a forever home.|`|eDySIDPQaa	No, your not wrong  by any means<br>  <br>  You are doing what is best for your dogs, you chose a good dog food,, you cared enough to get them good food,and not junk...<br>  <br>  Money is tight for a lot of people....and everyone does what they can.<br>  <br>  At least you care...|`|UETAqR8Taa	Nope your not bad. Just Smart
2RzEaod9aa	I eat supplements that are out-of-date, and that includes packaged foods as well. As long as it doesn't have a strange odor or mold, it's fine.|`|eDySIDPQaa	No, it is not safe at all..return it and get a refund<br>  <br>  It's just like you, you would not eat out of date food,cause it can make you really sick from old out dated food.....<br>  <br>  Please do not feed it to the dogs, that is why it's 2 for 1..<br>  <br>  they need to be reported to the health department, it's just like Pet-co, stores in our area, were fined for selling outdated dog food...and some of the bags even had bugs in them.<br>  <br>  so please do not feed it to the dogs.|`|71i6IjdZaa	Yes, it is only just out of date. The date is just what they have to sell it by, not when you have to eat it:)<br>  xx|`|eVyGiF7Xaa	Uhh DOg diarea But i suggest dont feeding|`|JySB8dOZaa	Yeah, if it is just slightly out of date. Over 6 months out of date, probably not so safe. I eat out of date food all the time, it is cheaper and i never have any problems. Also the manufacturers have to be really cautious with the use by dates and the food is usually fine to eat for some time after the date given, as long as it is properly stored.|`|fBGIUSfaaa	depends if its canned or fresh meat.. fresh meat is a bit questionable as a couple of months prob not a good idea, but canned food i think should be ok.. dogs in the wild would scavenge so i would say a pet dog eats quite well regardless... they also eat many other things that we dont see and seem to be ok.. however its your pet, i think you should decide|`|2S0BkT7oaa	The same thing happened to me.. <br>  <br>  Merrick food was discounted like 5 bucks off, and all the food was old. <br>  A couple of days is find, it's a sell by date.

This spoiled fat may contaminate fresh food added to the container, causing vomiting or diarrhea when fed to your pet..so i would say no..just think of your pet as your child...you would never feed urself or your fam exp food..so it could harm your pet as well..i would return it back to the store because they are suppose to remove all out dated food.|`|MUEMs2ataa	Well..<br>  <br>  If the shop is seeling off food, dog foo, you need to call someone relevant and report it.. If dogs eat off dog food, depending on what it is...They can get sick, just like us<br>  <br>  Would you eat something that was off date? .. Then why feed it to your dog!<br>  <br>  Off food for dogs are bad.. !! So call someone bout it please.. You dnt want other dogs getting sick from it|`|ybaeu04Baa	No!  Would you eat expired food?  No.  There is an expiration date for a reason.  It is not good and if you find food out of date you should let the business managers know about it.  They could be banned from selling pet food for that!  Trust me I know because I used to be a Pet Nutrition Specialist!|`|AluLGCS8aa	If you  want to kill your pet then it is safe or else are you nuts?|`|KQOqzxqyaa	what do you think? of course not! Try eating food that's expired and see what happens!|`|1ef30263233db716f0b5e6c40b22bc1aaa	pretty sure there's a reason for those dates, but hey! why not give it a shot and see what happens?|`|6L3TdI2Uaa	you want to try it<br>  <br>  best not to give it to your dog<br>  <br>  or are you asking us to try it?|`|vUiUoamVaa	Yes, it is safe - it it just that it has a 'shelf life' because the longer it sits on a shelf, the more the nutrients start to break down.  There is no guarantee that they break down sooner or later -- this is an estimate based on samples of the food over time by various agencies.  <br>  <br>  Basically, the vitamins and minerals start to break down over time.  It is still good and nutrious food...just don't buy it REALLY out of date.  A few months will not be that bad, but six months is getting iffy.|`|oGVWdnHraa	If it says "best before", then it should be fine so long as it is not smelling, or has anything growing on it, but if it says "used by", then I wouldnt risk it :)
eDySIDPQaa	It has nothing to do with your breed of dog at all.,,it depends on what your dog likes and if  it's digestive system will take or not take....<br>  <br>  No, it's not a gimmick..<br>  <br>  <br>  It depends if you dog takes well to poops after eating them..<br>  <br>  some wheat free treats do cause dia in most dogs......because they replace the wheat with some other ingredient to make up for the wheat or grain not being in there, they have to hold the binding of the treat together..or it they would just be crumbles in the box..<br>  <br>  they are suppose to have one of the best dog foods on the market, but that makes no difference, it is what is in the treat, not the brand name of the treat.....<br>  <br>  I feed for Treats, Welnees crunchy oven baked biscuits, wheat free. no dia, and my dogs love them|`|5vRGQPVfaa	i believe it all depends on the breed and your dog..some pple says its great and amazing..and some say it cause severe diahrea and watery stool or constipation..i guess just play it by ear and see how your dog handles it|`|fTMQOmhsaa	I just started feeding my dog EVO food.  It is supposed to be one of the best.

16XpYCBmaa	If you go to the vets they can maybe be able to feel if she is pregnant, the best thing to do is get a ultra sound done and that will determine if she is pregnant or not. But i think 3 weeks maybe be a little to early to tell. Good Luck.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	He/she will able to tell DURING the spay!<br>  GET IT DONE *NOW*!!!<br>  <br>  3 wks.is too early to determine pregnancy any other way-no palpation,no "signs".<br>  SPAY TODAY! HURRY! RIGHT NOW!|`|Bw18seFqaa	the vet can tell if she is pregnant.. he can palpitate, or do an xray or ultrasound.<br>  <br>  Yes, a spay can still be done.|`|AA11887983	It is too early to really tell.  Even ultrasound, which is the most useful, has to wait until 28-32 days.  And yes, they can spay her even if she is pregnant.  But you need to get it done fast.  After about 2 weeks, they will start to resemble pups, and some vets will not spay them then.  And it is certainly going to a be a bit more of a surgery than a typical spay, if she is pregnant. There will be greater blood supply to the uterus.  <br>  <br>  Check with your vet, let them know your concerns, and see what they say.|`|9kTejB0uaa	In the early stages a vet, or experienced breeder, can palpate and feel the early stages of pregnancy (it's like feeling little pearls in the uterus).   Also, later on, scanning can confirm pregnancy.  Take her to your vet and be advised by him as to her best options.  She can be spayed while pregnant, but this is up to the vet, and the overall condition of your b itch etc because this would not be a simple spay surgery.
bx7qmKbGaa	I have seen this kind of thing before. I think she may think it is her pup! That is why she is guarding it and whining when she is away from it.<br>  <br>  Some dogs just start acting motherly to toys. I saw a dog once that had several phones that she considered puppies. My friends cat started caring for a stuffed kitten.|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	It's okay it's pretty normal. I think every dog I've ever had(4 all together) has done this and it's usually the kind of toy that when they bite down it doesn't squeak... but when they let go of it, the air being released makes a whining almost cry of a noise. I just think they think it's their baby(even though all of my dogs have been spayed or neutered) and they are just caring for it and protecting it.|`|5d8cda11147363f74448679f58829463aa	We had this happen with a chihuahua of ours once. It was with a stuffed black cat halloween toy. She even went as far as to try and nurse it after a while. The vet told us she was going through a "pseudo-pregnancy" with the toy. Her hormones told her this toy was her baby and she took care of it just like it was one with the bond she made with it. Might not be the same in your situation but at least similar. It took our chihuahua about 2 months to get over her toy and then she moved on like she did before and always has since.|`|lyOpiCvcaa	well my dog does that but she gets false pregnancies.where she thinks the toy is her pup nad hse runs aroun the house whinning and hides it in the closet and stuff like that. my dog has false pregnancies im not saying yours does (she lactates and everything just doenst go into labor or have any pups) umm you can always take the toy away and see how she reacts.
meMF69tXaa	Poor little thing! My rabbits are very fearful of the vac. when we use it on the carpets. I have to put them in another section of the house and shut the door prior to using it.<br>  <br>  Have you tried giving your rabbit a treat to lure him out? Do you have any apples handy? If you have never fed him an apple, don't give it to him but just use the scent to bring him out. Or you could try using a towel to catch him. You just get him in a position to grab him and be careful not to put the towel over his face. This will give you more support when trying to handle him. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OvFEyvU5aa	WALK AWAY hes scared as long as you stand their he won't come out Btw rabbits are very sentivive and if you don't let it calm down. He could very easly die of a heartattack. Once you get him out put him in his cage and leave him in there for several days. each day when you feed him move your hand toward him if he dosn't come toward your and except it leave him alone when he starts comming up to you again you can pet.|`|Xx7WwVXRaa	rabbits are allergic to mold...you should probably move the couch and clean it. take his favorite food and try to entice him with it. then block the way to get behind the couch. i've read that they can die if they ingest mold. i don't know how true it is, but better safe than sorry.|`|uiJTMSw2aa	I used to hav a rabbit and we lived near the airport....every time a plane took off of came down, he would go crazy.

EHF8yYwCaa	He's awake, and bored.<br>  <br>  And he's learned that when he barks, someone wakes up and lets him out.  So whenever he wants out, he barks.  <br>  <br>  He's an adult....is he destructive in the house if you leave him loose at night?  Most dogs understand that night time is "quiet time".  Especially if he gets enough exercise and attention during the day, he'll be happy to sleep at night.  Why not try letting him sleep in the house with the rest of the family.  Try putting a dog bed in one of the bedrooms; shut the door if you're worried about him waking up & getting into trouble.  Generally, dogs are happier when with their "people" and this would be a headache-free solution.  <br>  <br>  Other option would be to recondition him- ignore the barking & let him out only when he's quiet.  But that depends on whether or not the whole family wants to lie in bed & ignore a barking dog for several hours, on a daily basis, until he begins to make the connection between silence = freedom.|`|ecae24e8b747b50b66e0c80c0c3c5f91aa	Maybe you have to spend more time with your dog taking him out 3 to 4 times a day. That way, he'd feel so exercised that he'd calm down the whole day by just laying down. When he's used to the exercise,  he'd calm down and stop barking. He's probably also having separation anxiety.<br>  <br>  Also, he might feel claustrophobic. How does your laundryroom look like? Is it too small for your dog to roam around? You know, have some headroom or legroom? <br>  <br>  After walking him, send him to the laundryroom and give him treats before you leave him there, so that he'll associate being the laundryroom as "pleasurable."<br>  <br>  Divert his attention sometimes. Like, if you see him getting agitated as you walk him to the laundryroom, read a book for 3 minutes with him there, just stay with him, then leave. He'll follow you, of course. But keep on doing that till he feels not anxious anymore. He'll forget that going to the laundryroom means being away from you. Reinforce it w/ treats, too.|`|nzf7Cujbaa	There is a possibility that he is scared of something outside or even inside. (Just make sure your not being stalked!!) What i do to make my dog stop barking, is to either hold him jaws together (make sure that he can breathe through his nose),<br>  or make him si (and if he wont, then push his butt down until he does)<br>  and say "No! Bad dog! Be quiet!"....and if that doesnt work, than try putting a treat in front of his face and make him focus on it.<br>  That usually shuts up my dog.|`|f3eec23d333564a9c4a310a06466ff3caa	He is letting you know he is awake and wants you to let him out and play for a couple of minutes. You don't gate him until 9:30pm, do you? He just wants some attention. My dog will wake me up by jumping on the bed and licking me a few times to let me know he wants me to get up and play with him for a little while. :)|`|p8K6Lmg6aa	Wow,had it for nearly 2 years & never trained it? <br>  Crate-trained or taught it shuddup?<br>  tsk tsk-shame on you!|`|xSSUcCDFaa	he is probably bored and in need of company, can you take him in your room with you until everyone is up.|`|ixutx59Daa	He wants to be with his family.

aeonmRR2aa	If you want them to live, return them to the store now.  <br>  <br>  Then decide whether to buy a 10 or 20-gallon tank with a filter, gravel, heater, and siphon for water changes and substrate cleaning, a bottle of tapwater dechlorinater, and some food (flakes are probably fine)...  and ideally, a light and hood.  There are various kinds of catfish, so it depends - little cories are OK though a group of 3 would be better than a pair, but big catfish might need more than a 20-gallon tank.  And perhaps they're plecos...   which may grow a foot long and eat all kinds of random things depending on the specific pleco variety.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you need to ID the species and see if they can live with guppies (both water conditions and temperament).  Livebearers are best kept with other livebearers in (IIRC) hard, alkaline, slightly saline water.<br>  <br>  Still, you need to return the fish to the store immediately because if you cram them all into an uncycled tank, they will die within a couple days of ammonia and nitrite poisoning.  In the 1-gallon bowl, I expect them to all die in under 12 hours, from suffocation.|`|AA11708471	return them and teach your girlfriend that she needs to do research before she buys any animal<br>  <br>  for 6 guppies and 3 corydora catfish a 15 gallon filtered and heated would be minimum<br>  <br>  If you have plecostomus catfish you will need a massive tank for most common types|`|o0yUd22Laa	You should not put them in a bowl, they should be in a tank with a filter.  I would recommend at least 5 gallons.  Also, they will probably die soon because they tank did not get the bacteria going yet.  You should get some really strong fish to put in the tank for a few months and then get the fish you like.  You should change part of the water every week, just like 25% of it and make sure that you never change all of the water at a time, even if the fish die.  You should also only change part of the filter at a time and change one part this time and then another part next time instead of just changing complete filter cartridges.  Also you should get some test strips to make sure that the water quality is right in the tank.  You should get a heater and a thermometer.  If you do all of these things, they will live a really long time, those kinds of fish are more on the easy side to take care of.|`|jBceLdeNaa	maybe u can get some kind of fish tank separator - u can go to your local pet store/ their website and see if there is anything good there
3sB49YNnaa	There isn't really much if any difference among breeds as far as size goes.  I have seen pigs in several of the breeds that were over 4 pounds but they were generally too fat.  The biggest pig we have now is an old sow who weighs 3 1/4 lbs give or take an ounce depending on the day.  She is a large bodied sow and big boned so she isn't really much overweight.<br>  <br>  3-5 years is a reasonable age for a guinea pig.  It is not uncommon to see 6 year olds.  Seven is getting old and it is rare to see a nine year old|`|aY3e2RLPaa	Guinea pig males can reach about 4 pounds and live 8 years or more.|`|aiIS83Onaa	The only difference between guinea pig breeds is the coat length/type/pattern. the body shape/size are not involved. However, in Peru, where they eat guinea pigs, they tend to be larger in size.

AA10327148	It is normal for a puppy to have a rapid heartbeat.<br>  A puppy up to 1 year of age has an average heart rate of 120 to 160 beats per minute.<br>  <br>  It is natural for a puppy to eat poop. He learned this from his mom, as it was her way of keeping the nest clean when he was with his litter. He was likely a little mamma's helper, and helped her clean the nest. The only way to stop him is to clean it up as soon as he poops, so he knows he can trust you to keep the 'nest' clean. <br>  <br>  Most puppies will bite..Don't allow him to bite you..Here is some counsel about puppy biting:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogpatch.org/training/biting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogpatch.org/training/biting....</a>|`|VX4aaUS6aa	German Shepherds can be like that...there are things that you can buy from a pet store or your local vet that goes on the dogs food and makes their poop less appetizing...good luck|`|M2M14eCjaa	Please visit the vet as soon as you can , i can also recommend the article below ,i got great tips and alot of help with my poodle from it, so read it and see what you learn about your pet<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1506410/how_to_house_train_your_dog_and_achieve.html?cat=53" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>

Life span: 15-25+ yearâs plus. Males have the longer front nails and are used in mating. <br>  **And  are considered mature at about 5 yrs old.<br>  ***** You canât start sexing till about 3â across.<br>  <br>  They will bite VERY   hard.  Under 4" they carry a disease called 'salmonella'. So you should wash after every handling ANY size turtle or reptile anyway.<br>   ***And my pictures don't lie. All ages and all sizes get along as long as their is allot for SWIM ROOM and PLENTY TO EAT! <br>  They can become cannibalistic if you have 2 or more turtles and a small environment. They will kill off the smallest and then fight for the tank for themselves.<br>  <br>  *** Ten gallons per inch of each turtle!!  Sliders, westerns, easternâs,  cooterâs , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied ,are all are basically the same and require the same basic care.<br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days!<br>    Did you know that they need to bask under a reptile light UVA/UVB for up to 8 hrs a day for the vitamin D that they need to grow. <br>  TOSS in a bird cuttle bone in the water for calcium that will promote better shell growth, it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it thatâs fine!!<br>  **Remember, you need a heater...set at 83 / 85 degrees. If water is cold they will stop eating!<br>  <br>  Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..<br>  <br>  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them in the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles, ghost shrimp , dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples cut up..|`|hrdRMOFAaa	turtles mate around this time.they start in aprile ontill the start of summer.they mate when they are aound 3 years old.if your turtles are small they wont mate for another 2 years.they will have to be around 5'' long|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Most turtles mate during the springtime. Slider precede mating with the male stroking the "cheeks" of the female with his long front claws. This behavior does not necessarily mean that mating is immanent, though. Sliders also use it as an expression of dominance. If the one doing the stroking does not have front claws quite a bit longer than its rear ones, you are not going to have mating.|`|8cikAYp3aa	depends on what kind of turtle you have, and how old/large they are.<br>  <br>  most aquatics will mate in the spring and clutch eggs in june or july.  Land turtles can mate when ever its warm enough for them to be mobil.  My box turtles were mating in January in my kitchen, and laid eggs.  Some turtles can mate now and not lay eggs for up to 3 years.  <br>  as for behavior,  box turtle males do a "dance" for the female.  Sulcatta's herd the female around in circles till she stands still.  painted males, shake/vibrate their claws at the females head.. So to find out exactly what your turtles will do and when Its best to google their species and read about them.
FC34jxiaaa	No, not scoopable clay litter. Clumping clay litter can be extremely harmful if it enters an orifice, particularly with such a small animal. I personally wouldn't use that garbage with any animal. It definitely isn't safe to use with rodents.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	NO! If the hamster were to ingest any of it,it would clump into a ball in the hamsters stomach,cause an obstruction and kill the hamster.Hamsters don't have to have sand to bathe in.You can bathe them with warm water and shampoo made for pocket pets if they are very dirty,but they keep themselves pretty clean.|`|f6a177061a935df6ab959c2ecb265589aa	Not even close. They need finer sand, not stuff that clumps when it gets damp. And I don't know what might happen if the hamster tries to eat the litter.|`|ybaeu04Baa	I grew up with hamsters and I have never heard of this!  Plus, Chinchilla sand is extremely different from cat litter! <br>  <br>  Hamsters groom themselves like cats, so they shouldn't need a bath.  If your hamster has mites and fleas, which is very rare, I would look for products specifically for those issues.|`|t4yBwlr6aa	I'm not too sure on this, i wouldn't use anything like that for my hamster, they tend to clean theirselves just fine with clean bedding, but that's up to you. You should research some more on the following sites:<br>  <br>  www.google.com<br>  www.ask.com<br>  <br>  Hope i've helped and good luck !
45N6tmWraa	Your dog should not be biting ANYBODY.  If you cannot control him, or gradually introduce him to your friends so that he is trustworthy, then you need to confine him.  Our dog will bark ferociously at family members if they come in with a new hat on:  she doesn't recognize them.  She gets corrected sharply for that.  It's not allowed to escalate to biting.  However, she has never shown a problem with our friends that she knows, no matter the color.
Ky5ZTWE6aa	You dont stop him, hes doing the right thing.|`|78UCobhkaa	Give him R.E lessons! lol<br>  dogs, like people can have strange fears. Get you friend to feed the dog treats when it comes near him. He'll soon realize black people are ok.|`|WcgKT98haa	Have them walk up to your dog slowly and introduce themselves with a treat and a scratch in his favorite spot if they're comfortable with him.<br>  <br>  If they're scared of him he'll know it, so you need to tell them not to be scared.
YPc76Ni2aa	flush that beyotch|`|YnCUyvK7aa	How many danios do you have in the tank?  This is a schooling fish that has a social structure where certain members are dominant over others.  It's better to keep them in a group of at least 5-6 so any bullying is spread out more.<br>  <br>  And your bully is probably a *she* rather than a *he*.  The females will grow larger and seem to know they can bully the smaller males [no smart comments please!!].<br>  <br>  You can tell the genders apart because the males will have a yellow line between the light and black stripes.<br>  <br>  It also helps to make sure your tank is large enough for the group you have, even though they're small fish, they're active, so a 20 gallon is recommended.<br>  <br>  They're often chosen to help start a cycle because they are hardy fish, but the space and number requirements are too often overlooked.  Then when other fish are added, they become part of the *school* as far as the danios seem to be concerned if there aren't enough other danios in the tank, and they get their share of bullying from that.<br>  <br>  If you don't intend to keep the danios, maybe check with the store where you got them and see if they'll take them in trade for fish you want to keep.  But many stores are reluctant to take back live fish because they have no way of knowing the age, or what disease or parasite problems they may bring back to the store once they've been in another tank.  Some other options would be to put them up for adoption through craigslist, freecycle, or local want ads.|`|AqeG4rw2aa	Use him as a feeder fish and if you don't have fish that need feeder fish find someone who does. oh and Effie â is funny too|`|LQcsiZlFaa	Return this to the fish store from where you bought the fish
x0WZE0i4aa	Assuming you are going to find homes for them yourself: First of all you should, at an absolute minimum, keep the kittens until they are 8 weeks.  Ideally you should keep them until 13 weeks or so, when they have had all their shots.  Kittens that are taken from their mums too early can have behavior problems.  Keeping them till they've had shots means you are sure the person taking them is paying for that too!  You could also get them micro-chipped.<br>  <br>  I'm against charging for kittens.  But there's also no such thing as a free kitten.... you should pass on the cost of shots and chips to the buyer, and it's reasonable to add up the extra price of food (your cat should be getting extra right now...), any trips to the vet for mum/kittens etc, and work out the cost of the kittens from that.  If it seems a bit low, you could also include a donation to a local charity.  Let the buyers know what is included in the price: good buyers will be glad all that's been done, bad buyers won't care and will be put off by the price.<br>  <br>  Ideally you should check the home they are going to.  By that I do mean actually visit!  Ideally you should have an arrangement that you can visit again later to check on them.  It's also better to home them in pairs, or singly to someone who's looking for a companion for a kitten they've already got.  This way the kittens have another to play with.  Ask your buyers if they have money for neutering, and health insurance.  Maybe arrange visits once the kittens are active at a few weeks old, but make people wait to collect them: tell them you have other people looking, and are going to chose the best homes.  This way there's no impulse buys and you can reject anyone who doesn't seem like a good home.  You could deliver yourself: and if they don't have food, bowls, a cat basket, litter tray, a place for the cat to sleep, a scratching place (these don't have to be cat beds and commercial posts, just something suitable), then don't leave the kitten/s.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't give them to a pet shop.  Yes, many pet shop owners do actually like animals... but not all.  And the price they charge isn't going to put off people who have money and want a kitten for something bad.  There are people out there who think nothing of paying hundreds of dollars for something they want.  And pet shops are not going to do home checks. <br>  <br>  If your mum doesn't want to keep them till the kittens are at least 8 weeks, then you should hand the mum cat and the kittens over to a no-kill shelter.  Hopefully it won't come to that!  If your mum won't go to the bother of helping you properly with home checks, and hopefully shots and chips, then taking them to a no-kill shelter may be the best.  Talk to them about how they decide who to re-home to.  You can decide from that whether they or you can do a better job of finding the best homes for the kittens.<br>  <br>  Edit: Micro-chipping is done so that if a cat gets lost or is stolen it's owner can be found/proved by the chip.  Don't know about NZ, but it's pretty standard in the UK now. I also suggested it as another thing that might put off someone who just wants a 'cheap' cat, maybe not for good reasons, but which would be liked by a potential responsible owner.<br>  <br>  As for spaying... for the cat population to stay stable, you only need a female cat to produce 2 kittens: one to replace her in the next generation, and one to replace her mate.  If you say the average litter is 4 kittens, then that means if every female cat had just one litter, each generation of cats there would be twice as many cats.  Where do you think all those cats would go?  Especially as without spaying a female cat is not going to stop at one litter...  In the wild most kittens would die, killed by predators or disease.  With pet cats the options are to euthanise the extra kittens or neuter cats before they have  kittens.  An operation isn't nice, but it's better than having to kill kittens.  I don't think you are evil for having one litter, but you should not let every female you have breed.<br>  <br>  Any benifit your girl has had from her kittens will be wiped out when you take them away and she's left mourning for them. (I'd have suggested you kept a kitten for her, but I guess your mum would be against it).  She is also at more risk of catching a disease, straying and getting lost, or developing cancer later in life.  So it's good you are getting her spayed now.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Well first off, since you're the one that irresponsibly allowed your cat to breed once the litter is eight weeks old take them to a vet and have all of them spayed and neutered.  Then surrender them to a no-kill shelter so appropriate homes can be found for them.  Can't afford to spay and neuter six kittens?  Well you should have thought about that before allowing your cat to breed.  At least donate something to the shelter to cover this. Why should they bear the expense for your mistake?<br>  <br>  DO NOT sell them to a pet shop or sell them.  Let the shelter find them appropriate homes.  Why would anyone even want one of your kittens for free?  A person can go to a shelter and adopt a kitten and for about $100 get one that's already spayed or neutered, up to date on shots, deflead, dewormed, tested for disease and microchipped.  If they take one of your "free" kittens they'll have to pay another $300-$400 to get all those things done as I know you won't bother doing any of these things.<br>  <br>  Thank you for adding to the pet overpopulation problem.  These six kittens mean six shelter cats will be put to death BECAUSE OF YOU since they'll take homes away from them - good job!|`|iuYtcX6Xaa	put an ad in the paper, do not give them to a pet shop...they will just contract some terrible disease there! plenty of people look for free kittens so just post ads and you will get responses!just make sure people dont want them for snake food because there are sickos out there that adopt free kittens and feed them to their snakes!|`|CEKZsoFRaa	Give them to your local SPCA or shelter for adoption. People love kittens, I'm sure if posted an ad on craigslist you'd get answers|`|oT71QN8Raa	I personally would go straight to a shelter, because despite the unnecessary rudeness from certain people...they are right.  The shelter will make sure each baby is healthy and goes to a good home.  And its safer.  And really, the shelters I have always seen have AMAZING living quarters for cats.  Like...better than my cats.  Each time I would go to adopt a cat, none of them wanted anything to do with me because they had all the scratching posts and cat beds and food they could ask for.  It's crazy how well cats are treated, when dogs are thrown into a cement cage with nothing to do.  sad...but true :)  So...check the local shelters out.  I dont know if ALL shelters are like the ones around me, but you might find one that is and leave the babies there knowing they will have a good halfway home :)<br>  <br>  As for a pet shop...I am not sure how NZ works, but I know pet shops around where I am and grew up wouldn't take animals from people.  They didn't know what diseases they may have (something I found pretty amusing) and refuse.  So...maybe it depends on where you live?  I'm not sure.  I just know that none of the pet stores I've ever dealt with would take anything from me (I tried to give them mice after one I rescued from a horrible boy had babies).<br>  <br>  And...just because I am THAT person - I do apologize for none of the rude people taking the "mum" factor into consideration and realizing that you probably have nothing to do with the veterinary care of your animals since you are obviously a child.  Parents do what they want and typically don't take orders from kids.  So, I can completely understand that its not YOUR fault this cat wasn't spayed. If mom doesn't want her spayed, she remains unspayed.|`|dfgFiAUNaa	ok well you can post them in your local paper but please do NOT put "free" becasue goups that still test on animals will come to get them and you don't know who they are and weird people who like to hurt animals will to. so what I do is list them in the paper with a price not to high and when people come if I have a good feeling about them I will give them the kittens and not charge them if I don't feel right i won't let them have one at all|`|ybaeu04Baa	You are on the right track!  More than likely a pet shop will not take them because they get them through breeders.  If I were in your situation, I would try to give them to a no-kill shelter because adopting is extremely popular right now and kittens will get adopted in no time!  They also do research on the homes the animals are going into, so you know that they will be placed into good homes!|`|p5uXXi54aa	We put a "Free Kittens" sign in our yard and an ad in the paper, and our kittens were gone in a few days. We actually had to turn people away! We talked to the people and made sure they were decent folks and had no trouble finding good homes for them.|`|AA11440402	spray it with water?<br>  i hope you spay it instead. <br>  Put an ad on craigslist for free kittens, have the people come over and meet them and make sure they are OK.|`|kkQHX0qdaa	ok,<br>  <br>  1. WHY WOULD YOU SPRAY YOUR CAT AFTER THE KITTENS LEFT?<br>  <br>  2. go onto ksl.com and post an add saying your getting rid of them|`|mwW4zIwIaa	If you want your kittens to have a good home, I think the pet shop would be a better option.<br>  <br>  You mean spay?|`|KIGhVitOaa	give them away|`|VEjWOmJdaa	Well first of all let me tell you it's not easy to give away cats but maybe you'll have more luck because they are kittens. I posted on craigslist when i gave away 4 cats and i put the terms like at the time they'll picked them up they have to bring a cage, or no little kids and no dogs,etc.Depends on you, and the other way you can start looking for no-kill shelters that way you are sure they will be adopted, the only thing is you gotta pay for the vaccines (each), and is gonna cost you a lot,otherwise they'll never received them. Good Luck !|`|zWGtc1qpaa	Bring them to a No Kill Shelter, because they are still kittens you can also bring them to the SPCA, the kittens are always gone first. Or you can ask your friends/family if they want so maybe you can still see them sometimes<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!<br>  this is the website for the SPCA <br>  www.aspca.org|`|7Ley3Uboaa	i suggest you give them to a pet shop because if you really need them gone and if you were to give them away free you cant depend on the people taking them. but if they are in a pet shop its likely that people wont spend money on a cat if they dont actually want it that much.|`|x3epnrnZaa	Just take out an ad in your local buyers guide or newspaper, we do this (in a small town) and most the cats are given away within 1-2 days.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Mixed breed cats do NOT need to have litters.  They have no "desire" to have babies - its strictly a hormone thing at the time.  But as far as the kittens?  Do NOT give them to a pet shop; that's the worse place to hand over kittens.<br>  <br>  I would put signs up in your neighbor hood (vet, grocery store, etc.) with a picture of the kittens.  Put down a nominal fee (to spay mom) for each kitten.  If a person is willing to take 2, give them a little discount.<br>  <br>  I would find out how much it will be to spay mom and then divide that price by 6 (for each kitten) - then you will know how much to charge.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Let's not call names here.  Are we somehow mind readers and KNOW you don't live in the US?  <br>  <br>  Spaying is not mean - cats BREED they do not sit down and happily plan a family like humans do (or should do).  Nature made cats to be both prey and predator, so they breed to supply a food source to those predators, and carry on the species.  They will not sadly mourn their fate if they cannot "have children"  In fact, altered animals are happier and healthier than unaltered ones!  Each heat cycle your cat comes into increases her risk of mammary cancer and a deadly uterine infection called pyometra. <br>  <br>  But to answer your question - here in the US pet shops are the worst place to give your kittens to.  They sell to anyone who's got the money, good home/bad home or otherwise.   It will be easier to adopt them out if you get them spayed/neutered first, and their first vaccines.  Advertise them in places where pet people go - pet stores, feed stores, the grocery store, vets offices.  Print up a fl yer with their pictures, and your contact information.  When people do call, ask for references and CHECK them.   Be sure to charge at least a token adoption fee, as I'm sure that even in NZ you have people looking for free food for large snakes (and free kittens are cheaper than rats).

oMmBhWK4aa	Juwel tanks use internal power filters where the filter pump head is submerged and hence absolutely silent. But the trade-off is the filter is rather bulky and hence some people prefer to remove the Juwel filter and use an external canister filter. Of course that will likely void any warranty. As the filter is stuck in place with silicone sealant, you need a tough utility knife to carefully cut it away. But if you do get the tank, suggest to run with the Juwel filter first as the performance is not bad, unless your tank has too much debris to clog up the filter faster. The construction quality of Juwel tanks is excellent and should last for many years. But depending on your budget and space constraint, you may want to consider buying a bigger tank as the Rio 125 is only 2.5 feet long, not that much space to play with for planted tanks and bigger fish.|`|dbZvPW3Haa	I have one of these if you have the cupboard for it my advice is to put something like carpet or under felt under the tank no noise then, however my filter broke i got a new one even quieter.|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	i take you mean the filtration side?if so i find all jewel tanks with their interior filter systems as good as any on the market.i have one and had no problems at all|`|44AkhdRnaa	I have one and it's very quiet.
AA11887983	Regardless of the age of the dog, if this is not normal behavior for this dog, then you need to get her checked out by your vet. Find out if she is overweight, and if there are any problems. <br>  <br>  As for dog years, there is no such thing.  That is a way for people to feel better that dogs don't live as long as humans.  It also is commonly used to explain how they mature so fast, compared to humans.|`|p7oi3P06aa	10 years is pretty old for a dog. 70 years.<br>  <br>  dogs are 7 years "older" than people. as you probably know dogs die (unfortunately) much much younger than humans. <br>  <br>  take her to a vet! 5 years old is only about 35 years old (6 is 42) which they shouldn't be in bad health. <br>  <br>  hope she gets better!|`|220b497f9a511b5df0fff475b46096ffaa	Since dogs live a shorter time than humans, it is commonly accepted that each year a dog lives is equal to 7 years for a human.

qEOJzbJraa	If you are renting you best be prepared from alot of crap from the management and landlord, because most landlords have restricted anything over 40lbs nowadays.Most apartment complexes do NOT like big dogs because they figure the bigger the dog, the bigger the messes. This may not necessarily be true, but that's how they think. I used to live in an apartment that "used" to allow big dogs. But due to one bad incident with a Great Dane and a busy owner, there was a thousand dollar worth of damage done to the apartment. Now, they have a 40lb weight limit.<br>  <br>  You also must be aware of breed restrictions. Yes, I meant breed restrictions. German Shepherds are on the majority of breed restricted lists at apartment complexes. <br>  <br>  You also must be aware of the fact that most also have a limit of two dogs. <br>  <br>  Me, personally, if I were going to have 3 large dogs, I would just save up and buy a house. Its one thing to 1 or 2 big dogs in an apartment, but 3 would be too much for me.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	If you are renting, you'd better know the rules regarding the size and number of pets.  Most apartments don't like big dogs and to have 3 large size dogs in an apartment may not be allowed.<br>  <br>  If there is a size restriction (under 30/40 lbs) none of those breeds would be allowed.  So you might have to look into getting a medium size dog.<br>  <br>  Or save up to get your own house with a yard where you can have large dogs.|`|tFKQYT6Naa	well i think its fine as long as your owner is ok with it...also you need to make sure that you will have the expensis for all these dogs... for example vet visits,grooming,food,licensing ect.. but you also have to train them becuz they are big dogs and sometimes they can get very out of hand if you dont train them...<br>  well hope i helped and good luck with your new puppies!|`|MP9QEZJraa	can you afford to feed,the vets,the licenses?also dogs this large need lots of room to run and play.i would reconsider to make sure all their needs will be meet.

Rw7gi86Naa	Remember, a catâs sense of smell is fourteen times stronger than that of a human. This is why it is so important for you to thoroughly clean the urine spots. Even if you canât smell it, your cat probably still smells the urine in the carpet, and this can make them want to âre-markâ that spot over and over.<br>  <br>  To remove the smell of urine from just about anything, first clean it with some sort of soap or kitchen cleaner. Then clean it with lemon juice. If you donât like the smell of lemon juice follow it up with a little bit of vanilla extract. One of the most effective formulas Iâve found for removing ANY odor was from Popular Science Magazine. Mix 1 quart of Hydrogen Peroxide, with 1/4 cup of Baking Soda, and one tablespoon of liquid dishwashing soap. Saturate the affected area, rinse thoroughly with clean water, and the smell is gone. This is non-toxic and safe for your animals and children, and those with allergies. This is especially helpful for removing skunk odor from your outdoor animals. As always, test a small portion of fabric for color fastness, before treating a large area. <br>  <br>  What Wonât Workâ¦ There are many home remedies for treating pet stains and odors, and let me stress that most of them are not too bad as far as removing odors for humansâ noses. Vinegar, ammonia, baking soda, laundry detergents, lemon juice, fabric softeners, and commercial strength pet stain removers are all great for removing the odors that humans can smell. However; you will need more to remove the odor for your catâs nose. An enzymatic cleaner is the best answer, but it is slow and may take more than one application, (Natureâs Miracle is one of them). The Hydrogen Peroxide/Baking Soda combo is fast, but can alter the colors of some fabrics. In the end, you must decide which application is best for your situation. <br>  <br>  Even if you clean a pet stain with soap and water certain micro-organisms remain behind and your pet can smell them. Enzymatic Cleaners are designed to completely eliminate the source of the odor by using enzymes to eat away the micro-organisms that cause the odor. The one drawback to these cleaners is that they are slow; it could take several weeks for them to completely eliminate an odor. Enzymantic Cleaners are available at most pet stores, organic/natural/health food stores, and even some hardware stores. You can also ask your vet for suppliers.<br>  <br>  **Never steam clean a stain. That will only make the stain worse!**<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pR1rp3huaa	1001 is the best for stains it actually cleans, get's rid of odour.

t6Ya3c3baa	Not one Garter snake that I have had has ever eaten any crickets.<br>  <br>  Once in a while, I can get my current Garter snake to eat fish scented mouse pinkies, but not very often.<br>  <br>  Garter snakes usually eat fish, and / or earthworms. My current Garter won't eat earthworms, but Garters that I have had in the past would.<br>  <br>  Goldfish and minnows (including rosy reds) contain thiaminease, an enzyme that destroys vitamin B1, so they are not safe fish to feed Garter snakes. Guppies are safer fish to feed.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, as supplemental food, my current Garter snake will take small bits of beef, beef-heart, chicken, tuna, or bluegill fish from the tip of a bamboo skewer.|`|kRbkiPvnaa	That was 3 questions,<br>  yes/yes/no|`|2MjcjKgkaa	Garter snakes in the wild normally eat amphibians, tadpoles, slugs, earthworms etc however they will eat mice in captivity.<br>  Start off with fuzzies - baby mice though and as the snake grows gradually increase the size of mouse. Can be readily bought in the frozen food section of pet shops.<br>  An ideal starter snake as they do not grow too big, can be handled and usually even tempered however I would not advise leaving children solely to their care and handling; the snakes health will need to be monitored, their vivarium regularly checked and the children taught how to handle a snake properly; Garters are escape artists and extremely quick! <br>  A wonderful family experience in my opinion and very addictive!|`|xSdnsSojaa	Garter snakes normally will not eat insects, but they will accept just about anything else. They prefer cold-blooded prey and in the wild usually eat frogs, toads, salamanders, earthworms, etc., and for ribbon snakes, small fish (ribbon snakes usually won't eat earthworms). In captivity, they'll do better if you feed them their normal prey, but if that isn't practical, they can sometimes be induced to take mice or even strips of beef, chicken or fish.<br>  <br>  Personally, I've never fed garter snakes anything but earthworms. I've never had one that wouldn't accept them, or that didn't do very well on them. You can catch them yourself or buy them at a bait shop.<br>  <br>  Garter snakes require very little in the way of care, and a gal with 8 kids should be able to handle it. <G>
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	What kind of tank are you keeping them in? Ich is primarily caused by bad water quality causing the fish stress leading to a lower immune system allowing the parasite to multiply.<br>  <br>  Make sure the tank they're in has excellent water quality, it warm enough and is well filtered - sponge filters are best for fry tanks until they are larger - and of course it needs to have completed the nitrogen cycle before fish are added.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	Treat the tank for ich.  Use aquarium salt and not ich meds.  Put a little less salt in the tank that what it calls for and your fry should be ok.  Also make sure you are feeding them fry food.|`|6KsGSDh5aa	Never heard of fry having ick.  Are you actually seeing it or guessing simple because the fish are ill?<br>  <br>  You need to do water changes in fry tanks daily.  If you actually do see ick, you'll have to treat it wil a medication.  I'd go with half doses.  They may not be able to live thru it but they won't live with ick, either.  At least you'd get giving them a chance, tho.<br>  <br>  Fry need to be feed several times a day.
qPdAJqKJaa	The most dangerous illness is parvo, but that isnt just spread through other dogs meeting, but by dog faeces on your shoes etc. If the dog is healthy, i wouldnt be too concerned.<br>  With the second question, when you clean do not use anything that contains ammonia, because that actually makes the urine smell stronger too dogs (luckily not too us) The best thing to clean with is with a cleaner that contains enzymes, as it will acually break down the smell, Also try to take them outside as much as possible for toilet breaks. Its great you are socialising your pup early, its so important for their development!<br>  PS what breed of puppy is it you have?|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	It's your house - tell them they are welcome, but "the vet" (a little white lie won't hurt anyone in this circumstance, right?) said no contact with other dogs for another month or so, so their dogs will have to stay home.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Probably be okay, if they are vaccinated, and otherwise fit and healthy.  But there is always the risk that they could bring an infection into your house, even if they are fit themselves.  Frankly I'd ask them to wait for a bit longer.  I don't understand how their 7 week puppy can have had her third set of shots?<br>  <br>  Sounds like a whole lot of potential problems to hit your young puppy with all at once.  Far better would be to meet up with all these dogs off your property - once your puppy is closer to 13/14 weeks by which time at least her shots should have taken properly!!
AA11887983	No, there really isn't an effective treatment for parvo at home.  Imodium AD is not a good idea, as the diarrhea needs to come out.  If it sits in there, it will just worsen the problem, causing bacterial overload.  Pedialyte is a good idea, if the dog is not vomiting.  I would not offer any food for 12 hours, due to the diarrhea.  <br>  <br>  But your dog really needs to see a vet.  There may be outpatient therapy for him, but since you don't know for sure what is wrong, no treatment can really be recommended here.  <br>  <br>  If the diarrhea stops in the next few hours, then you can introduce a very bland diet, such as boiled chicken and rice, in 12-24 hours.  But not if he is vomiting. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and please try to get him to a vet!|`|34uWa9kHaa	The dog needs a vet since that is not an option,  keep an eye on him overnight and get him to the vet in the morning (hopefully that is an option)   He is still drinking water.

Throwing up?<br>  <br>  Did you just get the puppy?   Or have you had it a few weeks.<br>  If you just got the puppy and it is now eating different food, diarrhea is gonna happen.   <br>  Did you change foods?  Could he have got into something?<br>  <br>  You can give him some plain pumpkin for the diarrhea, boil some rice and chicken this could be a of  this coming from a change in his diet or eatting something he should not have.|`|XPO11i9Yaa	OMG take the dog to a vet NOW if not treated soon the puppy WILL die!!<br>  <br>  Why would you even get a dog if you live somewhere that you can not take them to the vet? And where on gods green earth are you living that makes it so you can not take the dog to a vet? The country? pretty sure there's gotta be a town somewhere!!|`|VX4aaUS6aa	NO...the puppy needs to go to the vet immediately, parvo is fatal, and can only be cured by something that your vet gives you...a little pedelight however can help, but its not a cure...DO NOT inject pepto in to his stomach, you are not a vet and you could end up harming the puppy|`|5vRGQPVfaa	I dont believe its parvo. Parvo symptoms are much more severe then just diarrhea..its blood begins to be in the stool and hes throwing up then i would suggest you go see a vet because like the others below stated..it is very fatal. My grandfather raises hunt dogs which are known carriers of parvo have lost plenty of dogs to it. but diarrhea can be caused by viruses and parasites. A stool sample to the vet is a good idea to check for Coccidia (Coccidiosis), Giardia, Trichomonas or other infections.

Go the to vet or you won't have your pup long.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Parvo is Bad, need EMERGANCY veterianry treatment. Pepto used to be safe, but the formular has change & has ingredients now that are known toxic to dogs<br>  <br>  Animal poisoning by drugs is by far the most common type of small animal poison exposure, accounting for 75% of 1990 toxin exposures as reported by the AAPCC and 82 of 425 fatalities. Dogs and, less frequently, cats, can be poisoned by human or veterinary drugs as a result of accidental ingestion or overdose just like children can; it is worth emphasizing that all medications should be placed out of reach of inquisitive noses which are too often attached to undiscriminating mouths! <br>  This section focuses on those medications which are too frequently given by well-intentioned owners for the purpose of relieving discomfort experienced by the animal and which instead can cause a much more serious problem for the pet. Human over-the-counter pain relievers are occasionally used in veterinary medicine for pain relief but they should only be given upon specific advice and direction of a veterinarian. Pain relievers, or analgesics, are not designed for use by cats and dogs and a minimal human dose can poison a pet. Cats and dogs do not utilize and tolerate drugs in the same way people do and human drugs should NEVER be assumed to be safe for animals.<br>  <br>  Acetaminophen (Tylenoltm) -XXX   Top<br>  <br>  XXX - Emergency! XX - Highly Dangerous X - Dangerous <br>  <br>  Tylenol is, of course, a human over-the-counter analgesic medicine used to relieve pain. In people, after the pills are taken, the ingredients are broken down in the body by enzymes in the liver. In people, Tylenol is generally a safe and useful painkiller. Cats, however, have less of the enzyme required to detoxify the drug following ingestion. As a result, there are many dangerous metabolites, or break-down products of acetaminophen that bind to red blood cells and other tissue cells, resulting in the destruction of these cells. There may also be direct damage to tissue cells from the painkiller. As little as one regular strength tablet (325 mg) can poison a cat to the degree that it can develop noticeable clinical signs of illness. Two extra-strength tablets are likely to kill a cat. Dogs (particularly small dogs) are also susceptible to significant tissue damage from as little as two regular strength Tylenol and repeated doses increase the risk significantly. Signs develop quickly and can include salivation, vomiting, weakness and abdominal pain. <br>  <br>  Due to the significant toxicity to pets in relatively minimal dosages, the recommendation is clear - Tylenol should not be given to dogs or cats. Other, safer, drugs are available for pain relief; talk to your veterinarian about your own pet's specific needs<br>  <br>  NSAIDs: Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Phenylbutazone, Naproxen - X   Top<br>  <br>  XXX - Emergency! XX - Highly Dangerous X - Dangerous <br>  <br>  The pain relievers discussed here are known as NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and are widely prescribed with caution by veterinarians to relieve pain from arthritis and other conditions. Animal dosages, however, are much lower than human dosages. Use of NSAIDs can significantly increase the risk for development of stomach or intestinal ulcers, particularly in a sick patient, or one receiving other medications. These pain relievers cause signs of poisoning by decreasing the mucous production in the stomach. Mucous serves to protect the stomach from the acids it secretes and reduction in mucous production decreases the protection the stomach has from acid secretion and increases the likelihood of ulcer formation. In addition these drugs indirectly decrease the blood flow to vital organs, particularly the kidney, and can result in significant kidney damage. Two regular strength aspirin in a small dog can cause clinical signs of poisoning. As with Tylenol, cats are more sensitive to these drugs and should never be given these medications unless under the specific direction of a veterinarian. <br>  <br>  Again, these drugs can be safely used and, in fact, are employed in veterinary practice every day in appropriate doses and after careful medical evaluation of the patient. The important point is to recognize that dogs and cats do not respond in the same way to human medications that people do. Any medications need to be discussed with and prescribed by a veterinarian prior to giving them to your pet to avoid an inadvertent and tragic poisoning<br>  <br>  Pepto Bismol contains bismuth salicylate, which is somewhat similar to aspirin. While this medication has been prescribed by veterinarians at appropriate doses, large enough quantities of bismuth salicylate could cause effects similar to aspirin poisoning, depending on the circumstances of exposure<br>  <br>  Because many human medications can be very harmful or even deadly to pets, the ASPCA advises pet owners to never give animals any medication or supplement that is not specifically prescribed by a veterinarian. If you suspect that your dog may not be feeling well,  call your vet so that your pet can be properly evaluated and given appropriate treatment.

Maybe that would help.<br>  <br>  Last ditch effort, call a local vet, explain your situation and ask for a free consult, or ask the vet to recommend a reliable and appropriate new home for him-one with other birds like him...I know its not the best option, but think about it if you can.

He may need to get some antibiotics so you should contact your vet as well.|`|io0QtYYtaa	sounds like the cats anal glands need to be expressed, or they may be an infection in there. it needs to be cleaned thoroughly or the infections will come right back. take you cat to the vet and have them show you the proper way to express the glands, you can do it yourself and save the trip and money. good look|`|VX4aaUS6aa	You need to go to your local vet, it sounds like it may be an issue with his anal glands, a vet would be able to tell you more and give you something to put on his bottom..|`|qeR967J7aa	They do make cat butt cream-- go to a large pet store.|`|AqeG4rw2aa	lol your cat takes it up the poop shoot
aeonmRR2aa	If the temperatures are within a degree or two and tanks are near each other, just move the fish in the net.  However, it's best to transport in a hard container with water as fish like to flop in nets and may get their fins caught.  So just catch it, put it in a tupperware container of water, carry it over, and release.<br>  <br>  If the temperatures are very different:<br>  <br>  A 1-quart ziploc bag with half air, half water should work fine.  Don't use "breath" to fill the air - it has too much CO2.<br>  <br>  I prefer to float an open-top freezer tupperware container in the water, half-full of water.  After the temperatures have matched, if you are worried about differing water chemistry, you can slowly add water from the new tank to the container.  The open top also avoids suffocation risk.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.  A comment on David K's drip method:  Sounds pretty good for chemistry changes, but if you do something like that, it is essential to use a low-powered heater in the bucket (set to target temperature) or a well-insulated, partly-covered container (styrofoam icebox with a hole in the top, for example).  Otherwise the temperature in the bucket will gradually drop below ambient due to evaporation.  You can restrict flow through an airline siphon with an airstone on the upstream end (this also prevents things like fish fry from being sucked in).  I don't like putting heaters in tiny buckets, though.|`|hiAKx50Taa	Agreed with cherry also adding small amounts of the tank water into the bag will stabilise the ph along with the temperature.|`|UmtOV8mRaa	pail method<br>  basin method<br>  jar method|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	You can drip acclimate her, this is how:<br>  <br>  Larger fish may be acclimated to the aquarium using the "drip-line" method. Here, the fish is placed in a bucket set below the tank which has been filled with several inches of aquarium water. The fish in the "store water" is poured into the bucket. A six foot section of aquarium airline is used to start a siphon from the aquarium into the bucket. A loose "knot" is then tied in the airline so that the water entering the bucket does so at the rate of one drop per second. After a couple of hours, the fish may be netted and added to the tank.<br>  <br>  Just fill a 4 gallon bucket halfway and begin acclimating, it can take a few hours depending on how you tie the knot.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!

Plain, $40,  Bells and whistles, $60-ish.|`|CuP846Ezaa	Take al look at this site...heaps of info about building your own incubator and how to raise the chicks.

Once they've hatched (about 21 days but it can be more or less) leave the chicks in th incubator for egs for a while, until it's compleatly hatched (this is amazing to watch!) then put them in a box with straw, feed and a SHALLOW bowl of water with a heat lamp ver them.<br>  You will probably have to buy the incubator and heat lamp, but this does work
1bRRODd2aa	I'd go with the advice to wait until the child is 3 to 4 years old.<br>  <br>  Getting a new dog now is about the worst thing you could do. Once the baby is born the dog will be ignored, won't be trained and thus become the most dangerous thing you could have around a child - an un-trained dog.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a "family orientated" dog by breed or nature. A "family orientated" dog is a trained dog raised with a family.  There are breeds that are more likely to accept small children, but without training even they are unpredictable.<br>  <br>  The breeds you list, are definitely NOT the types of dog that you should be considering with a small child.<br>  <br>  Once the child is a toddler, take the whole family down to your local rescue center, take their advice, try out the dogs they have until you find the one that displays the right attitude to the whole family - take that one home.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Siberian Husky suck as security dogs! There too friendly! <br>  iF it your 1st dog, Avoid husky, geman shepherd-there too much dog for 1st time owners. ALL these breed have 4km-5km daily walks & at least 2 walks a day & loads of mental stimulation, with a tiny baby, i don't think it be possible to provide that much exercise!<br>  <br>  For protection . . . I know some may disagree but, it is my opinion, that the only time is it a good idea to get a dog for the purpose of protection is in professional or agricultural situations and only when the owner/trainer is humane and knowledgeable of dog behavior and dominant dog training/handling.  In all other situations - probably 99.9% - an alarm system, security fence, or other measures are much more appropriate and effective.<br>  <br>  Wait unitl the kids 6 or 7years old. Puppies require time and attention & no 8week old puppy is going to be interested in guarding the house, they are too busy learning.<br>   If a puppy does not teeth on your possesions, it will teeth on you and your children. Rescuers often get calls from panicked parents sure their dog is about to seriously injure their children.  It usually turns out the puppy is just doing what puppies do, i.e., mouth or nip. Parents, too emotional to see the difference, just want to get rid of the dog.  A growing puppy is going to put anything and everything in their mouth. It must be taught bite inhibition. As the puppy grows, the puppy's jaws become stronger and its teeth are replaced by its adult teeth.  The mouthing and nipping it did as a puppy now can have serious consequences.

Babies require LOTS of attention, and so do dogs. Trust me, you will be having a hard time keeping up with both a baby and a dog.|`|8eSbCrQraa	The best thing is to google "what dogs is right for us" and a lot of mini tests come up or go to the akc website.<br>  <br>  I must say, I have owned all of those dogs at one point.  I can honestly say they take so much socialization, potty training, crate training, attention, and exercise (the husky and shepherd) that you will be going nuts.  Dogs wont be content to play with toys because they get bored and want you.  They'll bark at you, chew stuff, and whine to get attention.  Getting a dog now, would be like bringing home twins. If you just get the baby down to bed, plan on going outside to walk to the dog, or that the dog could bark and wake up the baby.  If you're alone ever, you will have to some how get the dog walked and let it while also worrying about the feeding and sleeping schedule of your child.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend waiting.  When you do decide you're ready, this is my input on each breed:<br>  <br>  Shepherds: Need a lot of exercise and socialization but great dogs.  they blow their coat twice a year which is hard with hair everywhere, but love them<br>  <br>  Husky:  I loved our husky but would never own one again.  It needed about 7 miles of running a day and it was not content with the 6 acres we lived on.  It would still take off if given the opportunity.  It had a very high prey drive and killed the neighbors chickens.  I am not saying they're bad dogs, they are awesome, but their prey drive is strong.  If you can devote running at least 3 miles per day to this breed then its for you, otherwise it is going to be tough to own this dog.  Also, we owned invisible fencing, real fencing, chain link fencing, etc.  No matter what we did this dog (aka Houdini) could get out of it and take off.  Again, awesome dog, but needs a lot of care.<br>  <br>  Mastiff:<br>  We own two currently and I think they are the best family dog if given the proper socialization and attention.  First, they are really needy and think they are lap dogs.  They will follow you everhwere which may be annoying with the baby at first.  They need obedience from the start.  They grow so fast in the beginning that if you dont, you'll have a 100 lb puppy pulling you down the road.  On that note, if you dont stop nipping early, a 70 lb pup can do lots of damage....<br>  I dont think I'd ever own another breed besides this one but when she was a puppy I was very glad we didnt have children yet as she took so much time!  She was really shy so we had to take her on a lot of walks, puppy playgroups, and many other outings for socialization.  Its constant work.  And yes, they are lazy, but puppies are puppies.  They nip, chew, whine, bark, you name it.  <br>  <br>  Just be prepared if you have a puppy while bringing home a newborn you may have a rough time.  Good luck on your decision!|`|fTMQOmhsaa	Is this your first baby?  You may want to wait on the dog.  A dog is a big responsibility and takes a lot of attention.  You are about to have a new addition to your house hold that is going to take a TON of attention.  When you are ready to get a dog please consider looking at your local pound or animal shelter.  You are sure to find just the right dog for your family and it wont cost a lot of money.  good luck!|`|Z6vMRZqyaa	I don't know where to get those breeds of dogs, but I would recomend a boxer, they may grow to be big, but they are easy to care for and great with children! they have alot for sale on the sun website at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.local.thesun.co.uk/sale/pet/dog/-/pet_breed_boxer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.local.thesun.co.uk/sale/pet/d...</a> <br>  <br>  hope this is sort of useful<br>  <br>  Repunzel Anderson- Strange but that is my real name!!!|`|GZHS33n5aa	to be honest i think you should wait till you had your baby to be fair on both your baby and the dog, theres plenty of good dogs in the rescue centres, and you will get support from these places they will find the right dog for you.|`|URusy62Iaa	Try this website =). <a href="http://www.dogsindanger.com/searchReturn.jsp?BREED=&t=60&startId=5&zip=60607&radius=250.0&state=" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogsindanger.com/searchReturn...</a>

CJMhtM7maa	Your pup is just being a pup,he is to young to even think about marking.Just start his house breaking and in a few weeks he will learn.Remember his attention span is very short,so it will take time and patience.Good Luck.|`|24CFl7sjaa	My dogs do tend to wee in one spot and poop in another, as pups we used lots of paper and then reduced down to a smaller size as they got older and more able to hold it and had more of a clue where they were meant to be heading.. ie the door. However now they go outside, they will still wee in one area and have a different area for pooping. Scent marking is also possible especially if there have been dogs in the property before, an enzyme cleaner should help there and break down the scent that they can smell but you cant. I have an older dog who repeatedly scent marked a  new broom... I have put it outside now, goodness knows what he finds attractive about it!|`|Z6vMRZqyaa	He probably is but its only natural. I don't think it's quite that though. Because you only bought him 'yesterday' he might be peeing to remember where he's been and what's his. Also when he is pooing in the right place and not peeing in the right place hes probably nervous, because believe it or not that's what animals do when they are nervous.<br>  That is what I have seen and I work in the holidays at a vets looking after dogs.<br>  Hope this was useful to you.<br>                                         Repunzel Anderson- weird name I know!!!|`|HUlK3soAaa	Marking could be part of it.  Some could honestly be accidents.  Hard to tell with puppies.<br>  <br>  If it is marking, one thing that might make him more driven to do it is if another dog has wee'd in your living space in the past.  Doesn't matter if it's been years ago, that stuff hangs in there!<br>  <br>  Shortly after we got her, our dog (an Alpha female) wee'd all over our house (she was 6 months old and fully house-broken).  After pulling up the carpet in one room, turns out she was going where the previous homeowner's dog had gone years before.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Border Collies do not come ready trained :-) <br>  They need training just as any other breed, and this puppy is too young to have yet been house trained. At 8 weeks he cannot hold himself all night, and should not be expected to. <br>  He is also too young to be "marking his territory".<br>  <br>  While you are training him, crate him at night, but make sure in the day you take him outside often, as soon as he wakes up, every time he has been fed, and at least every 2 hyours in-between. Watch him for signs he wants to pee and as soon as you see them., take him outside.<br>  <br>  Stay with outside, with a chosen word, like "hurry up" and when he has performed in the right place, lots of praise and play before you bring him back inside. <br>  <br>  If you can, and it's warm enough, and you have a safe, secure yard, leave a door open when you are in so he can learn to go outside when he needs to. <br>  <br>  If you follow this routine consistently, he will be housetrained very soon.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  It is better to take him outside rather than put him on paper, otherwise you will then have to retrain him to go outside instead of using paper. Paper down is ok for accidents and during the night, but try to teach him to go out.
TORBP6QIaa	Its generally very easy to tell the difference...most (probably 99%) of fighting fish sold in stores will be males...they are the ones with the long flowing pretty fins...the girls are plain and boring in comparison and have short fins.  you can get males with short fins but they are not so common and regular aquarium shops dont stock them... You will likely have to ask your shop to get some females in if you wish to try breed them.

5QG9Zrjaaa	When I lunge, I work on longitudinal balance.  I always use sidereins, and usually a sliding inside rein, where the lunge line goes through the snaffle bit ring and up to the top of the surcingle.  This lets me take and give on the inside rein, and affect the balance to the steady outside siderein.  <br>  <br>  I use different sized circles, keeping in mind that small circles are much harder both from a point of view of bend and strength.<br>  <br>  To work on the longitudinal balance, after a good 2-5 min walk for warmup, I trot the horse for a circle and half, then walk a quarter of a circle, then back up to trot.  When the horse can do these transitions just off voice and body commands without extra steps, they are balanced.  Then I move to canter; the horse canters for a circle and a half, trots a quarter circle, then canters again.  When the transitions occur without extra steps or obvious inversion of the frame, I know he is balanced, and ready for me to get on and ride!<br>  <br>  It's also fun (at least my horses think it is) to do canter/walk and walk/canter transitions.<br>  <br>  Transitions are what build strength for the horse, so more transitions, the more strengthening for the horse with the fewest steps.  My horses all lunge well and happily; they don't just grind around in circles without change of what is happening.  They seem to like to have to listen to my frequent verbal commands.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	over hay bales, tarps, poles, <br>  <br>  Jenny|`|hGGf68GQaa	What about trying to lunge him through different objects like barrels, or even just the wall and yourself.  A lot of horses don't like being sent between the wall and a person cause they feel trapped.  So, you could always try that, or you could also try lunging your horse over barrels or small jumps.  If your horse is scared of water or just doesn't like it that much, you could get him used to walking through it by letting the water run out of a hose or something at a nice steady stream and lunge him through the slow stream of water.  You could also do the C-pattern when you're lunging him.|`|otojKoEkaa	over some barrels will boost their confidence and desensitize them. Working them on different sized circles makes it interesting. You could do some natural horsemanship exercises. They will help you and your horse bond.<br>  I like to do alot of stretching exercises in conjunction with lunging. It helps my mare alot.<br>  Good luck and have fun
AA12136244	(Double posted so double posted mine)<br>  <br>  Well obvious things would include a whelping box, heating pad, a separate box with a heating pad to put the newborn puppies in while mom is whelping, plenty of towels to dry off the pups, forceps to clamp the umbilical cords and if mom doesn't bite it herself some scissors to cut them with. Have all this in your bedroom or make a place to sleep so you can spend as much time as possible making sure mom doesn't lie on or even eat her puppies. Have your vet alerted that you may need them for a c-section and or have an emergency number for a vet who you know and trust. If you don't know them yet call them and talk to them so you don't get any nasty surprises plus you will be getting to know them well in the coming weeks. I can't think of anything else ATM but I will edit this if I do. Best of luck and congrats to mommy! :)|`|AA10938379	Find a quiet out of the way place and fix a pallet for the mother.

GOOD LUCK|`|AA11852609	All of the other answers are very good. When she is real close to being ready to have them, you will notice that she will be looking for a bed, and close to time, she will start panting and probably start shaking. Also will digg around in the bed to make it just right for her puppies. Let her have some space when she has them and dont handle puppies too much for the first couple of weeks.|`|AA12154986	Pretty much all of the above. Basically don't be afraid to get dirty. If the mom is having trouble, you may have to get in there and pull the sacs off of the pups. Or you may have to cut the umbilical cord (between 3 and 5 inches from their body then pinch the end of it to keep it from squirting blood). The normal time in between each pup being born is 30 minutes. This gives the mother time to expel the placenta and to clean her newest and make sure they are eating. If they are coming faster, definetly have the vet notified that you may have to bring them all in. As was said earlier, do NOT give calcium supplements as once you do this, the entire time she is nursing she will have to be on them or she may get milk fever or a number of other things.

AA10894618	Actually ferrets are not boring at all. Just the opposite. They are curious furry little animals that require at least 2-3 hours a day outside of their pens/cages. They love to play!<br>  <br>  Some people bring home animals because they look so cute and lovable, but the problem is that new feeling wears off. When you buy or adopt a pet make sure that you realize that this is a 10-15 year commitment. In some cases it could be longer.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to google "ferrets" on the internet. Read as much as you can about them. Their habits, what they like to eat, what to put in their cage, how often to clean their pen... etc, etc...<br>  <br>  The more you know the better equiped you are when you have one for a pet.<br>  <br>  Better yet, go to your local Animal Rescue League or Humane Society and hold one and interact with one. If it works out you might adopt one. It's cheaper and you'd be rescuing that ferret.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11334957	Ferrets are GREAT pets, just not for everyone. It's like everything else. One person thinks stamp collecting is the neatest thing in the world another would be bored to tears by it. Different strokes, you see?<br>  Ferrets are many things, boring is not one of them. Trust me, I have four of them.<br>  -Ferrets are expensive to get and to keep. They need special cages, foods and equipment. They also need regular vet care for shots, diseases and emergencies, so you better save your money now. Ferrets are prone to several diseases as they age, most are treatable to an extend, but at a price.<br>  - Ferrets are sneaky. They can and will get into and/or out of anything and everything. This can get them into trouble at times. I've heard of one that got under a bathroom cabinet and into the walls of the house. It took the demolition of a whole wall to get it out.<br>  - Ferrets have an odor. Most ferrets bought in stores today come from large scale breeders and are already spayed/neutered and descented. Still, a ferret will always smell like a ferret. You can minimize the odor by taking good care of them, keeping their litter boxes clean(scoop twice daily, wash box out once a week), washing their cage down once a week, changing their bedding weekly and by only bathing them once every 1 - 2 months. Bathing more often makes them even smellier sooner.<br>  - As you noticed, ferrets are a bit labor intensive and time consuming. They need their nails clipped, ears and teeth cleaned. You also should let them out of their cage about 4 hours a day in which time you should interact with them as much as you can. That's even more important if you are keeping a single ferret.<br>  - Ferrets live 6 - 10 yrs, most averaging about 8 yrs. Make sure you are willing to invest that much time into a pet. <br>  - Ferrets are trainable. You can train them to use the litter box and they will learn tricks, but it takes time and patience to get that done.<br>  - Some ferrets bite. Again, you can train them not to, but it takes a lot of love, time and patience to get them to quit. That's especially true in adopted biters. Note, not all adoptees are biters, most are not.<br>  There are so many ferrets out there looking for forever homes because people weren't aware of what they were getting into.<br>  So, please, do your homework, get informed, read up, talk to ferret owners and think twice about it. Once you did that, think again and then decide. <br>  Maybe a ferret isn't for you..........and that's cool too.<br>  PS: I love Shane's idea of volunteering and fostering for a ferret rescue near you. By fostering you get to spend time with one or more for a while and you get to see if they are for you without the permanent commitment. Good idea, Shane!<br>  <br>  PPS: Hi Jayne!! :)|`|5822db857feb9a9ced7c5512cf320a64aa	Ferrets are exciting pets as long as you can take care of them.  They don't stink as long as you bathe them and brush them.  They are like mixture of a dog and a cat.  Dogs stink if you dont bathe them, just make sure you get one with the glands removed.  You can walk them on a leash and they are frisky and lovable like a cat.  <br>  <br>  I have 3 and they are the greatest companions.|`|0a220753cded817d829cf8d0b781cd68aa	DON'T GET A FERRET - you obviously want a pet to amuse you but..........guess what.......ferrets aren't on your pay roll, they are living creatures which need A LOT of care and attention. As for them being boring after a few weeks - the poop scoop, cage cleaning, money it takes to keep them and bedding wash is very boring, but also very necessary. I have 1 ferret who I adore, I don't mind doing what it takes to look after him properly but I didn't get him just because I thought they were "cool" I did a lot of research before I got him and my ferret is anything but boring. I don't think you're ready for any pet yet and DEFINITELY NOT a ferret!|`|7bbdf6870d2e60533400e9c12f79ba40aa	Volunteer with a ferret rescue and foster one for a while.  You'll help save a life and learn whether this is something you want for the long term.|`|d768942d7979ad2f5bdf31564d97b27baa	who ever told you they get boring after a few weeks must of been on something really good or bad  because.... the more Ferrets  get to know you and bond with you....the more they will entertain and incorporate you in their play time. My Ferrets just get closer and closer to me every day. actually, I have one that after two years, he  just started holding my hand with his little paws and licking me while I give them more food or water or for no special reason other than to be close and to show affection. Does that sound boring? hope this helps and remember that ferrets have gottin a bum rap mostly because most people are uneducated with them. Yes, some do bite for no reason but that's few and far in between, even decented, they have an oder and they're little fangs that poke out of their mouths just a bit scares people but it's all how you treat them. If you give them 1 pound of love, they'll give10 pounds back and if they start to learn a bad habbit, if you get on it fast...the problem is usually over and NEVER tap or hit them on the nose because they don't have any bone in there and you can sereiously hurt or injure them. Scruff them behind the head on the neck just like their mother would do and with a stern voice, tell them NO! and they will pick up on that ALMOST every time. Also they will disown you if you get to hitting or even tapping them in the face. (I'm not sure why but I heard that by many people). If you give your ferret a chance you will enjoy him.HINT:: if you can't spend at least an hour every day, I would get two. they will keep each other from learning bad habits and have company. they are not loners. :)|`|11bd14c0860294ab23940dd98c4daa94aa	Having a Ferret you would think is cool if you ever went shopping at "PetsMart" they have EVERYTHING you could ever think of for the little fellows!

Those cute little furry critters had broke their necks!  Then one of them bit my little girl!  Well that was the last straw, she got rid of them (gave them away)  Sorry to be so BLUNT, but I really have heard horror stories about the little fellows and would hate to have someone LIE to you!

I could never figure out how to train him to use his litterbox outside his cage, people says its like training a cat, but I have never had to train a cat before.  I would do as musch research on them as possible before getting one. They bite too and get into everything. Goodluck!!|`|507716aef521674ff01cd43c0f5cb772aa	ummm, NOPE<br>  <br>  if your asking if ferrets can get boring, yeah, if your that type of personality that gets sick of cleaning litter boxes daily, taking it out for 2 hours at least a day, trying to find missing socks, keys, and anything shiny, having to look under the couch cusions and blankets before sitting down, nibbles on your toes...  they are 2 year olds for life, and REALLY little ones to bat.<br>  <br>  but because of that, they are NOT the pet for everyone!!!|`|786564f06561077fce45b3ef1f11eefbaa	No dont get a ferret they are horrible little things honestly dont mean to be nasty but the smell really really bad.

They stole shiney stuff too.

At 4 months, he'll be much easier to house train because he already has some bladder control.  Also, everything else will be just a bit easier.

pYF9KnNeaa	You can but no, not whole wheat.  You can give him small squares of toasted WHOLE GRAIN.  But he needs much more than that.  I imagine you are feeding seeds so make sure it is a mix with no sunflower seeds in it.  Find one that is safflower seed based.  Pet Smart carries a good one.  They call their Nutriphase.  But if you have a Pet Supermarket near, they have one equally as good and cheaper.  But, the seeds should only be about 20% of his entire diet.  He needs some good pellets mixed with his seeds and, every day, he also should have veggies, fruits, cooked pastas, cooked brown rice, scrambled eggs and leafy greens, just to mention a few items.  Of course he doesn't need each one everyday.  mix it around and give him a variety to keep him interested.  Having him on a good diet can save you tons of vet bills.  The leafy greens he can have are kale, mustard, collard and turnip greens and romaine lettuce.  No ice berg lettuce and no spinach.  I hope that helps.|`|QB0CnrmJaa	Yes make sure there is no bleached flour in it.

I have 5 females and they are better off in groups or pairs... females stink less too|`|hC4Z8HIbaa	An experienced rat person could easily sex a baby rat as young as a few days old. It isn't quite as easy for an inexperienced rat person. Rats tend to start developing around 4 weeks of age, but some rats can be up to 6 weeks before testicles become prominent. I have included a website for determining the gender on rats at this age. Hopefully you will be able to determine the rats' gender. And good for your cousin for wanting to get the rat a friend!<br>  <br>  Before your cousin brings in a second rat, he should look up some information in the second website below about quarantining. It is a process that should last at least three weeks, in which the new rat lives in a ratless environment (preferably in another house, but can be in a completely seperate area of the house from the original rat). This gives the new rat time to present any diseases that could be harmful to the first rat. It could be something as easy as mites, or something as bad as a rats-only deadly virus called SDA. Afterwords, you should do a proper introduction, which you can also find information on in the second website below. It's not as simple as putting the second rat in with the first rat. Certain steps should be taken to prevent fighting, as rats are very territorial. Other than following these two steps, and making sure you have the same sex as the rat you already have, there aren't very many "pointers" I can offer" Just pick a rat that bonds with you. Don't just go in and pick the prettiest one. Let the rat pick you. <br>  <br>  The second website is a rat owner's forum that I am a member of that I suggest having your cousing check it out. It is a great source of information for all rat owners. I highly recommend it.
qw9ZjAlDaa	DMSO acts as a carrier for other compounds due to its ability to penetrate the skin and other membranes so well.  Although it can be used by itself, it is very often used in conjunction with something else because of these properties...which it sounds like you already know.  Therefore, whatever you mix it with will be carried through the skin and into the membranes so I would hold off on the color shampoo while the DMSO is active.  Most of that stuff probably won't hurt her, but why draw that stuff into her system when you can avoid it?  Once you stop using the DMSO, it should wear off pretty quickly and I would think the shampoo would be safe to use within a day or two.  I think the amounts of anything found in the shampoo would be small enough that they probably wouldn't harm your horse, but again, it's not worth risking either if it can be avoided, in my opinion.|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	I would ask your vet about it. If you can't, then I would wait at least 2-3 days before using it just to be on the safe side.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	I wouldn't use it with that shampoo.  Use the color shampoo when you are not using DMSO anymore. <br>  <br>  Jenny|`|IMPvzBk1aa	No you should not use this product until you are sure the carrier effect of the DMSO is no longer active on your horse's skin.  Since the DMSO penetrates the deeper layers of tissue, you should contact your vet to determine how soon it would be safe to start using this product, after you have stopped using the DMSO.|`|AA10776535	I would wait a few days after you stop applying the DMSO.
zv8QaMe1aa	I have done rescue without being home all day.  Momma and kittens go into a 2 story cat pen so that they are safe and out of mischief range.  In that pen there is a cat bed, a litterbox, food, water, toys and the food and water are on a level above and as far from the litterbox on the lower level as possible.   Give fresh water and food 2 or 3 times a day and clean the litterbox whenever it's been used...... if Momma is in there with the kittens nursing them, they'll be fine whether you're home or not.   I have pictures of a Momma and her 4 kittens that I brought in a couple of years ago, the kittens have gone to live with friends and I still have the Momma..... here's a link to photos:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://s156.photobucket.com/albums/t27/placidair/Sophie/" rel="nofollow">http://s156.photobucket.com/albums/t27/p...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see, as the kittens got bigger, I added more shelves in the pen, and ramps and toys, and a feeder with Royal Canin Baby Cat kitten food, since they were needing more space to roam and stretch and play.  When it came time to start socializing them, they were big enough that with the shelves all in place they could climb up to the top door for me to bring them out and hold, pet and play with them....which did not please their entirely feral mother (she's calmed down a lot since), but we got so if I opened the top door and said "who wants rubbins?" the kittens would all come running up to the top to get their turn.... so they went out to their new homes quite well socialized.<br>  <br>  And it's both VERY rewarding.... and heartbreaking.... I cried when those kitten went to their new homes.... if I do another group this year, I'll cry when they go too.... I get very attached.... but they HAVE gone to good homes, and I occassionally get photos e-mailed to me and have even been able to visit the boys at their new home in January and they are doing GREAT... and if they'd been left out there for animal control chance are they'd be dead..... so heartbreak.... yup.... but rewarding wins by a longshot.<br>  <br>  Will your shelter want to set rules about you beng home?  If you can show you have a safe and secure setup for them while you're out of the house at work, I doubt it.<br>  <br>  If you're going to do the foster Mom thing, I think a cat pen is an essential piece of equipment, I've used it with every cat I've brought into my home until they've adapted (including the 2 formerly feral cats who live in my home) and it helps them acclimate to being indoors, around people and to using the litterbox.... so while it will cost you a bit of money, it's well worth it.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|dWed21jUaa	I rescue on my own, no organization behind me.<br>   <br>  Fostering is very rewarding.

Have you any experience with a stallion?  I am guessing not as most wouldn't want one unless they are for breeding. plus over half of the stallions in the world have no business breeding into the over populated horse world in today's market, nor do they actually have traits desirable to the gene pool. There are enough fugly horses out there that are needing rescue with out people creating more.<br>  <br>  Did you know that a lot of rescue meat horses are selling for MORE then some healthy sound and BROKE horses out there? This is more proof of the bad market. <br>  <br>  I would sudgest looking for a welsh pony. They are small and have better temperments then shetlands. Fjords are nice too or if your just driving and using it for a companion there are tons of mixed breed ponies that would suit just fine. I won't relist all the sites people have mentioned, most of them are good. <br>  <br>  Don't just go buy the first thing you see and it would be wise to take a horse savvy person with you when looking, expessially if they arn't from breeders. Make sure they are sound and healthy (via soundness exam from vet if possible) up todate on all shots and vaccines so that they don't infect your other horses and make sure they are dewormed. If you are looking at a mare make sre that they can varify if she could or is pregnant. ALOT of people end up with unexpected foals because previous owners lie or with hold information.  A lot of money can be wasted if you arn't careful and buy on impulse.

hetZz4c1aa	Actually torties do have a reputation for being a bit temperamental.  It's called  Tortietude: That bit of spunk and attitude that makes tortoiseshell cats so unique and endearing. While very charming and lovable when calm, torties also tend to be high-strung, easily riled up, and prone to overreact.<br>  <br>  Now this is not a scientific fact, but more a general opinion of many who love their torties.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|UMrTczvSaa	Every vet I've taken my 19 year old tortie to says the same thing.  She has cattitude! It is a stereotype, but of course there are exceptions. She will hiss up a storm at the vet.  They laugh at her there. They love her feisty old lady attitude.  At home she is very friendly with humans. She isn't a lap cat, but she comes and rubs against us and expects pets and affection.   She tolerates the other animals, but she is alpha. My two dogs and two other cats obey her orders.  They would probably say she is mean, but she doesn't do anything to them.  She just doesn't put up with any of their nonsense.  She is the grand dame.  I figure that at 19, she deserves to be in charge.|`|krgtMHx7aa	Torties and Calis tend to have attitudes.  I have a tortie who rules the roost.

But being pregnant i guess she's just beeing lazy or too tired. I'm not sure what you could do. <br>  <br>  She probably is scared because she's in a new home. I'd try to see if her and the kittens get along because then she wouldnt be as scared cause she woudn't feel alone with a bunch of human strangers that are bigger than her. if they get along then i'd let them be with her. but if it went wrong i'd just drop that idea.|`|zv8QaMe1aa	I used a cat pen for Momma and kittens when I rescued a feral family.  <a href="http://s156.photobucket.com/albums/t27/placidair/Sophie/" rel="nofollow">http://s156.photobucket.com/albums/t27/p...</a> is a link to photos of the set-up and how it changed over time as the kittens started to get bigger.... when they were about 6 or 7 weeks old they were using their little litterbox and Momma was using hers and they'd been tested disease free so they were let out and about in my home at that point to finish growing enough to be adopted out.<br>  <br>  The cat pen works well, gives Momma a safe and secure place to be in.  You can put in a cat bed, small litterbox, food and water and toys....  and you won't have to worry about Momma stashing her kittens where you can't find or reach them and having any of them die and be under furniture where you can't find them.... which can happen if they're loose.<br>  <br>  If you can't get a cat pen, put a box with a piece of blanket or a towel in a room you can secure and that doesn't have hazards in it... such as a bathroom (keep the lid on the toilet down when the kittens are becoming mobile) that you can close the door on.<br>  <br>  If the Momma will let you, you may be able to wipe her down with a damp washcloth with a bit of baking soda in the water you soaked it in on it... that could help "destink" her.  Good luck.
G4achLMPaa	Yes, you can but it at Wal-mart, it's cheaper there anyway. Get the Wal-mart brand too, it's just as effective. When I first got my one horse, she came with rain rot. I bathed the spots with straight betadine. Rinse it off good when your done, it dries the skin out.  I only had to bathe her twice and it went away. I left a space of three days between baths though. If your horse is wearing a blanket, I'd wash that too along with any tack or brushes you use that have come in contact with the area.|`|Ih0B30Pvaa	Well, you can't buy it at the regular wal-mart.  Some times walmart has a horse section.  Betadine is like iodine and does the same thing.  You can buy both betadine and iodine at any feed shop.  Also, if your horse has rainrot I would shampoo that takes care of rainrot.  Which is found at the feed shop as well
LazxXqXjaa	There's always risk involved with anesthesia, but if the bloodwork indicates that her internal organs are functioning properly and her blood cell counts are normal, the risk is greatly reduced.  Make sure she has an IV catheter during the procedure - that will help keep her blood pressure up, help her kidneys flush out the anesthesia, and will provide access if emergency drugs need to be given in the event that something does go wrong.  <br>  <br>  The benefits of getting those bad teeth out are definitely greater than the small risk of the procedure, so you're doing the right thing for her.  Good luck!|`|AA11457471	Sure you should be but your vet has done the right thing doing the bloodwork first.<br>  If the teeth are bad, they've gotta come out if possible, for her overall health.|`|u7vrul2Faa	If your cat is fit and healthy apart from the teeth problems she should be fine. Naturally there is a slight increase of problems occuring while under anaesthetic in older cats but your vet would have told you and warned you about this I am sure? <br>   <br>  It is well worth it though because bad teeth can have a bad effect on the cats health and quality of life, your cat will gain a new lease of life again once those bad teeth are removed, you will be glad you went ahead with the op. Goodluck and she will most likely be fine. If your cat had a high risk of problems occuring your vet would not have advised you to have this op done on your cat.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	The vet is the one who's done the blood tests and examined her; I would take his word over anyone's on here! There is no reason a 20 year old cat wouldn't be OK under anaesthetic if she's been vet checked as OK. The vet wouldn't be doing it if the risks outweighed the benefits.<br>  <br>  Have you expressed your concerns to the vet?<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|qI12jcVpaa	No you should not. The vets will make it so that she can't move. Even in the rare case she does wake up, she may be severely frightened but cannot feel any pain and can't move. <br>  <br>  Also, the professionals know what they are doing. Have you ever got a tooth pulled or had surgery? Nothing has happened. Your cat will be fine.<br>  <br>  She may be a bit sore after wards, but some pain killers should do the trick. This is almost exactly like getting neutered/spayed or getting declawed. <br>  <br>  <br>  Believe me, there is no need to worry.<br>  Hope I helped! xD|`|M1Rrir5Faa	she's in her golden years; let's make them more comfortable for her. sedation is the best thing to do in this scenario, because simply numbing would likely cause her some distress. trust your vet, but if you're still unsure, you should ask for a second opinion. best of luck, and i hope everything turns out fine.|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Wow if she's lived till 20 I wouldn't worry about her. That is old for a cat. She seems pretty tough. I think a tooth pulled is the least of her problems.
O60IrDMCaa	omg i think eagles r the cutest bird everr!!!!! but u cant have any other pets though... cauz u noe.. n they also attack kids... soo ya...|`|1gDTiPVyaa	Parakeets and cockatiels are both relatively easy for beginners. My first bird was a parakeet and he lived for 9 1/2 years. I now have an 8 year old female cockatiel--she was young when I got her.<br>  <br>  Males of either species tend to be more likely to talk, but there are males of all species that just don't and females who will. Some never do and aren't interested in learning. <br>  <br>  An annual check-up is essential as are prompt trips to the vet anytime you notice signs of illness. Birds do not have teeth. As far as nail trimming, most of the time, if you have the right kinds of perches (NOT sandpaper) the bird will take care of that himself.<br>  <br>  Cockatiels come in a slightly lesser range of colors and may easily live to 20 years. Cockatiels also need larger cages and larger (more expensive, usually) toys. On the other hand, a really people-oriented cockatiel will be happy with a human playmate and won't really be much interested in toys. Mine thinks she's a person and won't play with bird toys--not when she can chew up the edges of all my books. I think cockatiels are also a little more emotionally dependent on the human they bond with--much like their larger cousins, cockatoos.  The rarer color mutations can be fairly expensive--mine was $130--but there's nothing wrong with the standard gray and yellow. I didn't intend to get a rare one--she climbed onto my shoulder, started screeching and wouldn't get off. She picked me--I had nothing to do with it--just my luck she was a whitefaced pearl. She is the most spoiled thing in the world, though.<br>  <br>  Parakeets are more like tiny parrots.  They seem more interested in toys. They don't seem to get as upset if you're gone to work or school most of the day. They're not quite as destructive as a cockatiel can be. They are less expensive usually and I've seen some pretty spectacular color variations although there's nothing wrong with getting a hardy little green and yellow buddy.<br>  <br>  I can give you guesses as to how much to spend for cages and toys. Remember to get the largest cage you can reasonably afford. Parakeet cage ($30-$60 or more), cockatiel cage ($100-$250). Make sure there's enough room for at least two perches, food and water dishes, a swing and a couple of toys. Parakeet toys can cost a little less than 'tiel toys--they're smaller--get two or three to start with and expect to spend $30-$50 for either type of bird. Make sure you have washable food and water dishes--some cages come with them and some don't. Be sure to get a cuttlebone for calcium, too. There are different sizes for different size birds. High quality food is important, but you will probably have to start with whatever the bird's been eating at the petstore. (Many general pet stores feed seed because it's cheap and easy to get.)  Pelleted diets are $7-$10 per bag or more depending on where you live. This is something you could also probably get at the vet's office or online. Set back $100 or so for the first visit to the vet for a well-bird exam. Plan to do it fairly soon after bringing your bird home. Look for a certified avian vet or a vets office that sees a lot of birds. Ideally, the avian vet will also be a bird owner and you'll be able to develop a good relationship. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EZzHjm8Vaa	i would get a parakeet or a cockatiel. parakeets are cheaper and live for less time, so you can see if you like birds first. <br>  <br>  males are much more hyper, and females are quieter, but with a female you have to worry about extra health problems like becoming egg bound, plus the angry weeks right after they lay an egg.<br>  <br>  clipped wings is cutting the last 6 (it might be 12) wing feathers. It stops them from flying, but it must be done every 6 months because they grow back<br>  <br>  birds are less expensive then dogs. <br>  BIRDS DONT HAVE TEETH!<br>  nails should be clipped when they get long or sharp.
f77638df19b856e06b377813782f45faaa	I got my cat spayed because my friends cat kept on having kittens all the time and it took a lot of work to find them all homes . Though i was kinda scared because of the anesthesia  and that they were going to cut up such a little cat ,though now i'm happy i got lori spayed because she doesn't have to go thru heat and having kittens all the time . I also convinced my friend to spay her cat , because she was nervous that her cat would not make it through that procedure and she is glad she got her cat spayed too .  Yeah i think it's heartbreaking that so many little kittens have to be put down because of careless people or who don't think it through .|`|AA11906603	You are so right!  It's so sad.<br>  <br>  We only have 2 cats now, but they have very strong personalities and I just don't think we could take any more in. We also have a bird.  Both cats are fixed, so I am ready.<br>  <br>  I volunteer at a wildlife rehab place and I'm getting ready for the huge influx of animals and birds that will come very soon. So far I have only been able to work with birds and baby squirrels, but I started getting the preventative rabies series so I can help with raccoons too. We had 40 of them rehabbing at one point last year.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	Kitten season breaks my heart. I have two cats and I really wish I could adopt more but I simply can't. Both of my cats are fixed as much as I love kittens I don't want them popping out every few months, and a cat in heat is SOOO annoying. <br>  <br>  Personally ( gets ready for the thumbs down) I think if you can't keep the kittens you should have the cat brought to a vet and fixed as soon as she is of age. Or if she does get pregnant get her fixed ASAP. If you feel bad about aborting a litter of kittens just think of the thousands that are put to sleep or die from neglect or exposure every day. <br>  <br>  I think if a cat owner can't put the kittens in a shelter or rehome them or keep them they should have to euthanize them. I'm not talking about drowning kittens I'm talking about bringing them to the humane services or a vet and having them humanely put to sleep.  I think having to see a healthy beautiful kitten being put to sleep would get someones rear end in gear so they would get their cat fixed. <br>  <br>  As for no kill shelters, they are not the magical solution to everything. The one here stirred up a lot of controversy  because if their animals become " unadoptable" they get sent back to the city shelter which isn't no kill.  They may have changed their policys now but that upset a lot of people. Many No kill shelters will refuse animals for many reasons. The big one being they're too full and can't take any more. <br>  <br>  I think there needs to be spay and neuter clinics that easy to access and easy to afford. I know some people that have paid close to $300 to get their female cats spayed. If clinics had days where you could get your tom cat done for $30 and your queen cat for $50 I think you would get more people getting their animals done.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Our shelter has...around 90 cats currently. Some of which are available and some that are not (yet). Our Humane Society put out a plea in some of our local newspapers about our high relinquishments have been, and that even if you weren't 'looking' for another cat, if you could possibly afford another one it would make a huge difference. And WOW did that make a difference in cat adoptions! In the last two weeks we've had close to 40 adoptions! We had in one day, 7 cats go home! When you only have a population around 100, 40 cats makes an enormous difference. Just a month and a half ago, we had about 170 animals, most were cats, with maybe 15 dogs, and a few smallies (hamsters, guineas pigs).<br>  <br>  I will honestly never understand why people don't spay/neuter their pets. Both of mine came pre-sneutered because they were both adopted, but I will always do it no matter where I find my animal. It is incredibly sad, but our shelter is lucky that we have the luxury to only have to euthanize animals with severe behavioral or medical issues and never purely based on resources.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	You are so right. Cats can have 5 to 6 kittens per litter and 4 litters per year and if a female lives to be 5 or 6 years old that # of cats becomes astronomical.  And those are just some, there is the feral community to think of as well. Thanks for bringing up this point.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	There are few noises as grating on the soul as a female cat in heat.  I mean, that and all the other reasons, cost of pregnancy, health ramifications, pet overpopulation, etc. etc.|`|tnTxHVO5aa	During kitten season, I am always ready.  Last year I took in 9 abandoned kittens.  I found them all beside rarely traveled roads.

Yep she would just toss it a slice of pizza.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	I didn't want to deal with kittens, females in heat or males spraying. All 6 of mine are spayed or neutered.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	No,I am not ready.I hate to see it come.Last summer,I ended up with 4 kittens.My brother took one,but I kept the other three as all of the shelters were full and they would only take them to euthanize. So now I have 15 cats! I don't need any more,nor can I afford them,so I hope that no one dumps any kittens on my porch this year. I was just watching Animal Cops:South Africa,and there,they will spay or neuter animals for free.I think that this country needs to do the same thing,as more people would take advantage of the chance to get their animals fixed.<br>  <br>  I had my cats and dogs spayed or neutered because it is better for their health and I don't want them having kittens or puppies. It's a shame how many animals are killed because people are so irresponsible.If they cannot afford to get their animals spayed,then they shouldn't get them in the first place or they should keep them indoors and save the money to get them fixed.|`|AQsiugSpaa	Hi there Pretty Kitty!<br>  <br>  I am afraid you are correct that we will be beseiged with questions about pregnant cats.. all kinds of them. It is sad that folks just let their unspayed cats roam, mainly because they can't stand their behavior anymore, their noisy calling, and how they can become so demanding of attention. <br>  <br>  The problem as I see it is lack of education from the start, and those folks who either want to watch the "miracle of birth" themselves or have their children witness the birth .These people should have to watch the not so miracle of euthanasia of the unwanted kittens and cats to truly understand the huge implication of this selfish act. With webcams all over the internet today, watching live births of reputable registered breeders is available, and films are available for this purpose.<br>  <br>  <br>  Many of them will claim they have homes for them, but don't have enough knowledge to ask people to spay them, or spay them themselves prior to giving them away. And yes, with today's economy that is a hard pill to swallow. And so many of them eventually end up in shelters anyway.. it is a vicious cycle... and so many don't realize that spaying and neutering is so much healthier for these kitties.<br>  <br>  I always neuter and spay my cats, and I do it for health reasons as I never let a cat outdoors. I spay and neuter early. always spaying the female before they go into estrus to prevent serious health issues.  Neutered and spayed cats also make better pets.<br>  <br>  So at least Yahoo Answers does give us the opportunity to continue educating folks about the need for neutering/spaying and how important and humane it is. Thank goodness we do have a platform where we can reach so many people, and not just those who ask the questions, but those that are reading the responses.<br>  <br>  Thank goodness that there are folks who give their time, energy and financial contribution to the rescue of so many unwanted cats ( and dogs). They are the angels here.<br>  <br>  Thanks for posting this really important question and gearing us up for our own "kitten season" here at YA.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association|`|UNFxjNHkaa	If I went to that shelter that you are talking about and seen all of those kittens in boxes in the hallway waiting to be put to sleep, I probably would have wanted to take them all home with me.  And its really a shame that we cant do anything - all we can do is try to help people understand why spaying/neutering is important!  No animal should have to die because of irresponsible owners.<br>  <br>  And that's why I spay/neuter my cats.  There are too many cats being put down everyday due to kitty overpopulation, really, if you think about it, is so so so sad.  <br>  <br>  If we all spay/neuter our pets..this problem wouldnt be as big of an issue as it is now.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	I have seven cats, all adopted & neutered/spayed.<br>  <br>  Me and my mom also foster cats for a short period time. We recently fostered a pregnant cat that was too far along to abort the kittens, she had five kittens. We are keeping one, and thankfully we have lots of connections to many cat lovers and have found homes for the remaining kittens. and I know they all will get their kitten fixed.<br>  <br>  I just try to keep a positive attitude and tell everyone I know to get their cats fixed.|`|V4ljwCE8aa	i have adopted or caught all of my cats off of the street. I always get them neutered shortly after i get them. If people want to get their cats neutered, or any other animal at that, they could take it to the local animal shelter and it would be cheaper than the veterinarians office. <br>  <br>  People should always get their pets neutered or spayed unless they are breeders and know what to do.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	It's tough on my mom and dad.  They live in the country, and cats are always being dropped off on their road.  They have at least five now, none of which were wanted.  They don't want to shoot them and they can't afford to spay/neuter them all.  They really aren't even interested in buying cat food for all of them, and the cats have destroyed their garage.  They're very destructive.  I'm really hoping that the local vet will cut them a deal on spaying and neutering them all.|`|dWed21jUaa	I have supplies and my mom said she'd be willing to take some of my "overflow" if I get them fixed first.<br>  <br>  I live in a mobile home and right now I have 8 cats and abunch of people begging me to take more.

I agree that the Humane League right now is in tough times, and I really didn't want to turn over this cat to them, for fear of you know what happening to it. We have been feeding it, and sheltering it, and it's looking like she might soon being taking a trip to the vet, via me and becoming our second baby. As long as our first baby doesn't cause too much of an issue. What else are we to do? Our kids are becoming too attached....|`|Ka3fbxszaa	I do hope that the question you asked will at least bring this problem to the attention of a few people that are not totally aware of the impact one unaltered cat can have. <br>  <br>  I also rescue mostly barn (dumped) cats, as well as, help care for a feral cat colony of 50 plus cats...(TNR). <br>  <br>  I find myself struggling with economy issues that make it more difficult for me to continue rescuing all this kitties, then finding it hard to place the ones I do have. (brand new litter of 4 born last night from stray mama!)<br>  <br>  We have all found ourselves affected by the economy BUT don't let it be an excuse to not alter your pets.

I normal foster a lot of pregnant ones, and babies that dont fit at the shelter, but I myself am due with my 2nd child any day now, so I can not take on the added burden and I feel TERRIBLE! I just wish people would stop dumping kittens. It makes me cry too much lately.|`|gjrbp1Aoaa	I don't think I could ever feel prepared.<br>  I cannot stand to set foot in a shelter.  I haven't been in one for almost 15 years to get a puppy.  It's just too much for me to handle.  <br>  When I was 8 we got a kitten for my brother.  They had a room full of kittens. It was an amazing experience for me as a kid being surrounded by kittens. They were so cute.  About a week after that some disease got passed around in the shelter and every kitten was killed. That's something I will never forget. <br>  Even without going to shelters, there's still plenty of heart ache outside my door. I try to do what I can for the stray and feral kitties in my area.  I get coupons from friends that I use to help pay for the food they get each night. But they still face too many dangers and don't live long out there. So I have to prepare myself to catch any girls that show up and get them spayed. I did let the girl who found us last year have her kittens since she was already quite pregnant and very happy to be inside, but I won't do that again.  I love her and we had homes for the babies lined up before they were born but there are too many kitties out there and I can't keep any more inside so it has to be spay and release.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why did I decide to spay/neuter?<br>  I didn't.  I've never even considered not getting it done. I always had pets growing up and they were always fixed. To me, it's just part of having a pet. <br>  Where I live now it's illegal not to have your pet fixed - not that anyone checks though.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Excellent point Pretty Kitty. I hope all those people who've been asking questions about their pregnant cats read this and get the idea (but they probably won't because of course, people always have excuses as to why THEY are not part of the problem; even though they are)<br>  <br>  We're having a nice quiet period at work at the mo. We do a lot of work with The Cat's Protection (main cat charity in England) so we always have strays boarding with us, sometimes for quite a while; we're not really equipped, we only have cat cages, no runs; but the Cat's Protection never euthanase healthy animals so sometimes there's just nowhere else for them to go.<br>  <br>  Soon we'll start being loaded up with kittens. The Cat's Protection can only fit so many in their shelters and foster homes; many that come in (even the ones that don't require medical attention) have to board with us until there's room for them. We have some kittens for up to a month-6 weeks; that's a large portion of their kittenhood spent in a cage!! <br>  <br>  This is the story I tell people who think it's OK not to neuter their cat (male OR female) before 6 months of age. There is no excuse, yet people never stop trying to give them.<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	it is so sad that animals have to suffer because of human irresponsibility.  it isn't that hard to get your animals spayed/neutered before they are 6 months old.  it really doesn't cost all that much either there are plenty of programs that will do it for reduced cost or even free.<br>  <br>  I volunteer at a a no kill shelter and we do our best not to turn any animal away so it gets very hectic and crowded in that small shelter. by early summer we usually have 150-200 cats alone.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	We don't have ''kitten season'' in our sleepy little village. All of our cats are neutered because the rules specifically state that all outdoor cats must be spayed or neutered. We have feral cats that are also rounded up every year for spaying and neutering and shots.<br>   There hasn't been a litter of kittens around here in over three years. We get our replacement cats from local farmers.<br>   And all of this is accomplished without the benefit of an animal control officer or a local animal shelter. And our only vet is 40 miles away. All this is done with local volunteers and donations.
IMPvzBk1aa	The best time varies with seasons.  Sometimes night grasses are way higher in fructans and it is better to keep the horse off of the grasses.  Other times night grasses lower in these sugars, and daytime turnout is best, especially in early morning.  I'm posting a good article on the fructans in grasses that should help you with this................<br>  <br>  <a href="http://equisearch.com/horses_care/feeding/feed/fructandanger_032205/" rel="nofollow">http://equisearch.com/horses_care/feedin...</a><br>  <br>  You might also consider the use of a grazing muzzle to deal with this.  I use one on my easy keeper mare, and it is very effective.  I use the Best Friends Deluxe grazing muzzle, and it is the best one available.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	You want your horse to have less grass? You could put a grazing muzzle on on him instead of stalling him... that way he can still run around and get exercise.|`|qNuynJNLaa	Put it this way, your horse will not loose weight unless you exercise him and feed him on a healthy diet, I've owned horses in the past and I have never heard that feeding or a night/day makes any difference. If you can't exercise your horse put him/her out on part loan/lease for a few days a week and have someone exercise him for you! Thats what I had to do when I went through family problems, sadly I had to sell my horse, but he went to his sharer so I still see and ride him quite often, but you still need to exercise your horse to keep him fit & healthy or he will keep putting on his wieght wether you have him in or out.<br>  <br>  If he lives out or is out more than he's in and you bring him into the stable more he may become difficult to handle and even ride as he's used to being free in the fields, so keep this in mind.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	If the horse has never been on grass you need to introduce them gradually or they run the risk of colic or founder. During the summer when the flies are bad our horses go out at night and are in during the day. During the winter they go out during the day and are in at night. It depends on your climate and your personal preference.|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	My friends horse went down with laminutus and couldn't get up. It took 4 of them to push her up.<br>  Put the horse on a small pasture, and as she looses weight, or the grass has practically all gone, extent it a bit or move it along. Or, loan her out on shortterm loan to keep her in fitness.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	Make sure your horse still gets the proper nutrition!!!!!!!!!!! Not sure about what time of day. I never heard its different. Just be careful about the spring grass!|`|oQmL4IdWaa	If you horse is overweight, the best thing to do would be to take him off grass all together because being overweight, and out on grass is putting him at risk for founder.<br>  <br>  That being said, the "safest" time to allow grazing is the early morning hours when the night time low temperature did not drop below 40 degrees and overcast days.<br>  <br>  Turn him out for an hour in the AM and keep him in the rest of the time.<br>  <br>  check out this website for more info<br>  <br>  www.safergrass.org|`|GKAmSUiUaa	Be careful about just putting the horse on a field. Bear in mind the risk of laminitis or/and colic. Especially if the field is full of rich grass!<br>  <br>  If your horse is quite greedy, I'd give it hay but in a haynet with quite small holes just to slow down eating. <br>  <br>  Don't you have anyone who is able to exercise your horse for you and make it fit? That would solve most problems. Have you considered loaning or sharing?
f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Ask for vet references and take the kittens to the home rather than letting the person pick them up.  Ask if they would object to a follow up visit sometime in the future.  If they are legit, they shouldn't mind. Make sure the contract clearly states the cats can't be used for research. This website has some great tips for safely rehoming pets.<br>  <a href="http://www.pet-abuse.com/pages/animal_adoption/free_pets.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.pet-abuse.com/pages/animal_ad...</a><br>  <br>  One slick trick is to state in the contract that the cats must be returned to you if the owner ever, for any reason, can't or doesn't want to keep them.  This way, if they were to do something, you would have legal recourse to sue them and to regain custody of the cats.  And I agree if the adoption seems too shady, just back out.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	That's why animals need 'adoption fees' added to them.  Once someone else has them you don't know what's going to happen.<br>  <br>  In our city if you give a free cat, kitten or puppy away there's a chance they can get a good home. There's also a chance someone's taking them as free training fodder for pit bull fighting training, as laboratory sales animals, as free snake food for their large python or boa (yes, often enough that the reptile store doesn't allow any advertising of puppies and kittens on their bulletin board), and in the case of dogs--being eaten.  We have a large Hmong population in the city and the animal shelter had to hike the price of dogs up over $130 to stop them from being adopted and eaten by Asian immigrants.<br>  <br>  Go with your gut. If you don't think they're the right people, then don't give the animal to them. Just say you're sorry but the cat has medical problems or was adopted by a family member and isn't available anymore.  They don't need to know the real reason.|`|hetZz4c1aa	If the cats go to a lab, then the contract will have done them no good.  Believe me these folks will not hesitate to break a contract.  If you think the adoption is questionable, then don't do it.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Never give pets away free. Always charge an adoption fee. Has your friend contacted the local shelter to see if they can rehome the cats for her.|`|nQdGGBN4aa	Apparently this sort of thing happens quite often. <br>  <br>  People take free cats or kittens and sell them to labs or dog fighters (to allow the dogs to kill the cat/kitten). I've also read of problems with people taking free kittens and using them for food for extremely large pet snakes.<br>  <br>  I have read comments about adopting out cats (or dogs) which recommend you charge something for the cats. The suggested amounts I've seen are around $25.00<br>  <br>  The reasoning is:<br>  <br>  1) If the person cannot afford $25.00 for the cat, how will they be able to afford the necessary, routine medical care and ordinary expenses - food, litter, etc.<br>  <br>  2) If the person is going to sell the cats to a lab (or dog fighters or some other ghastly thing), the $25.00 will probably wipe out most, if not all, of their possible profit.<br>  <br>  As to your friend having bad feelings - tell her to go with her feelings if they are telling her something is wrong.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the contract could require that she inspect the person's home prior to the adoption and again after the adoption, say a couple of months afterwords.<br>  <br>  I'm not really sure that inspections would help but it might scare off anyone wanting to get the cats to sell them.<br>  <br>  I also don't know that the contract would do any good unless your friend is prepared to take them to court if they violate the terms of the contract.<br>  <br>  One thought - if your friend has someone sign a contract, have her check their identification to be sure they aren't using a made up name when they sign the contract.<br>  <br>  Question - where did your friend get these cats that she is trying to "rehome"?<br>  <br>  To everyone - please, please have your cats neutered or spayed.<br>  <br>  If you think you can't afford it, search for organizations which do neutering and spaying at reduced cost.<br>  <br>  Try a Google search on: low cost spay neuter city state<br>  <br>  Replace city and state with your city and state.<br>  <br>  You will likely find several places where you can have a cat/kitten spayed or neutered at a reduced cost.<br>  <br>  Also check the Humane Society.|`|AA11457471	A contract means nothing to someone that slimy!<br>  <br>  If she's not comfortable with these people she has every right to say "no" (or "Sorry, I already found them another home".).<br>  Keep looking for a home you're comfortable with!!!<br>  <br>  Also, don't advertise them for free. Ask a nominal fee. That will help sort out the ones selling to labs & looking for snake food.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd rather send mine to kitty heaven than a questionable home but then, I've seen more cruelty than most people can even imagine!|`|0mb78CiWaa	You can visit the persons house and see if it is suitable for a cats. You can also have often check-ups on the cats after they take them.<br>  <br>  If you still are not happy with this person taking the cats. You could always give them to a no-kill shelter.<br>  <br>  You can also see if someone you can trust like family, friends,etc wants any cats.

hjCEZQB2aa	Guinea pigs are not scary! They are incredibly cute! They have the wood shaving smell because of the shavings you use, but they are not smelly. They do though, take up space and require lots of attention. I think you should wait to get a guinea pig, that way you only have one rodent to take care of. Save all of your love for one pet first because it's easy to transfer your affection to the other. But, if you show that you are willing to pay for it and take care of both, do chores to earn money, beg (lol), do more research, and show that you really want one and are willing to work for one maybe your parents will rethink it. :)|`|FGZR9RwDaa	omg trust me you do not want one.<br>  i wanted one so bad, and i got it and now i don't want it.<br>  they smell really bad, and they take up alot of space.<br>  don't get one, save your life!|`|7aisLVeiaa	Do some research on guinea pigs, and how to care for them. Then go to your parents and let them know you did your homework, and know all about guinea pigs, what they need, and how to care for them. Make them confident that you are serious about this, and that you intend to take care of your guinea pig - without it interfering with them, or your responsibilities. And show them that you are responsible enough to look after it.|`|C0KU33Hoaa	Ok, well, tell your parents what your telling me!  Say that if you can take care of a hamster, you can take care of a guinea pig!  Show extra responsibility for the next couple of week by like, helping around the house!  I know how it feels to want another pet (trust me!)  Tell your parents you'll bathe him if they think he's dirty, and say "I want to give an animal who need one a home!"  (Don't beg or annoy, just remind your parents every day for a while, like at dinner or after school!)|`|Pq5896Pxaa	When I was 11, I got my guinea pigs. (I'm 13) I did lots of research, put it all in a packet, I wrote and elaborate essay, And I got money for their cage. That was enough to convince my parents.
zv8QaMe1aa	I'm guessing your mother is going to find out when you start doing lots of laundry to clean up your bed..... if you don't do it right and really get the smell out the cat will think your bed is his litterbox.  So step 1 is going to be to thoroughly and completely clean your bed and bedding .... it's not easy, you'll need to clean as much of the dirt off of your bedding and bed as you can and discard it, then treat the bedding with a product such as urine gone or nature's miracle, then you'll likely need to run it all through the washer multiple times with detergent (probably 3 or 4) to get the smell out completely......  I suspect your mother is going to figure out something is up.... in fact, depending on how old you are, you may need her help with this... especially going to the store and getting the urine gone or nature's miracle if you don't already have them in the house.   Then you will need to make sure none of the urine soaked through the bedding and into your mattress.... cat noses are much more sensitive than our's are... and even if YOU can't smell it, it won't mean the cat can't.   Hydrogen peroxide can be sprayed on the mattress to help get rid of any scent if it hasn't been soaked, if it's very stinky (which means you can smell it at all once the bedding is out of the room and you sniff the mattress) you'll need the stronger stuff for that too.   I recommend getting one of the waterproof but breathable mite blocking mattress covers....that way if he does it again, at least your mattress is protected.  The pillow covers are a good idea too.... have your pillows been soiled?   If so, you'll likely need to replace them, it's almost impossible to get that smell out of pillows.<br>  <br>  As far as getting him to stop doing it.... you didn't really give us enough information.   How old is the kitten?  How long has he been in your room?  Is his mother in the room with him?  Has he been checked out by a vet for health issues (UTIs can make cats go in places other than their litterbox)?  Is the litterbox being cleaned often enough to suit him?  Is he old enough to want to be marking turf?  If you answer all of the above and those reasons are ruled out, you're going to have to not only do some serious cleaning to destink the room you may need to cage him in a pen with a litter box for him to use for a while until he gets used to using the litter box.<br>  <br>  Once an animal "uses" a place other than the litterbox, they will keep going back to that place until it is properly treated and cleaned to not smell like a good place to go.  Consider putting a tarp or sheet of plastic over your bed when you're not in the room and once cleaning the smell out of the other areas he's already soiled try putting aluminum foil over those areas so that he won't want to go there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PIVKGi2Eaa	just gotta have newspaper on the ground lots. when he gets a tad older its like instinct hell use the litter box or outside cant for get just a baby still

Eo07UMsRaa	All-purpose turnout blanket. If you blanket a horse for daytime turnout and then leave for most of the day, you need an all-purpose blanket because one never knows what Mother Nature will throw your way while you are gone. Your blanket must accommodate a warm Indian summer day as well as a snowstorm. This is a tall order.<br>  <br>  And even if you have the luxury of being at home with your horses while they're out, you probably won't want to chase them around the pasture to change their clothes if rain threatens. So a good, versatile turnout covering is the single most important blanket you will buy.<br>  <br>  The two most important requirements in a turnout blanket is that it is "waterproof " and "breathable." So whether your horse opts for a roll in the snow or you have one of those unseasonably warm days, it won't matter.<br>  <br>  If, after a good romp around the paddock, your horse is hot and sweating under his blanket, it's an invitation to illness. That's why a blanket that "breathes" is so important. Moisture is allowed to evaporate while keeping him warm, so he doesn't get chilled. And, if it rains or snows, a waterproof blanket will keep him dry.<br>  <br>  Stable blanket. <br>  <br>  Although many horses spend most of their time in a turnout rug, most people prefer changing to a stable blanket for nights in the barn. Barns usually are warmer and the stable blankets are less bulky, allowing horses more flexibility to lie down.<br>  <br>  Coolers. <br>  <br>  Whether your horse is clipped or not, you will need a cooler after riding. Irish sweatsheets are extremely versatile and can be used year-round in conjunction with heavier coolers for winter weather. Polarfleece coolers are a good choice (I use these!) because they wick away moisture, allow the horse to dry quickly and are washable.|`|SzW9GmRsaa	I've competed right to the top in the UK and I've never clipped a summer coat...<br>  <br>  If you clip now you'll ruin the summer coat.  The best thing to do is get at him with the rubber curry; his coat will be changing by now.  And besides, I doubt he needs a hunter clip as he obviously hasn't been worked over the winter or you'd have clipped him back in October like the rest of us!<br>  <br>  Honestly, I've got some of the hairiest breeds there are, and I can guarantee you'll wreck the new coat if you clip now.|`|LUAzrVqVaa	Where do you live? Unless it's New Zealand and your winter is just starting its way way too late in the season to clip your horse, you will ruin his summer coat.|`|Oiabe82gaa	Where is the horse, does he live in or out?<br>  EDIT:<br>  Well depending on where you are and the daytime temps I would go with a light weight turnout to a mid weight turnout rug!!!<br>  Good luck!|`|ztMeGHY0aa	Don't clip start scrubbing. You will get the winter coat off eventually by the time the shows start. I just love that clean smooth summer coat when it comes through it gleams oh I can't wait!|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	I would leave face and legs on, they get very cold otherwise, just clip up to cheek bone on each side of the face, and have the legs clipped at the tops only.<br>  <br>  As for rugs, why have you not thought about this before?  You will need a good Turn-out rug, with neck cover or hood, and a similar rug for the stable.
3sB49YNnaa	That is a pretty standard water bottle and should be fine.  The ball helps to keep it from leaking.  The easiest way to check is to fill it, attach it to the cage and touch the tip of the tube while watching the bottle near where the cap attaches.  As you tap on the end of the tube, your finger will get damp and a bubble will appear in the bottle as air goes in to let the water out.  It is important to look for the bubble since sometimes you will get a damp finger even when water is not flowing well!  If you watch while your pig drinks, you will also see bubbles as it gets water from the bottle.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't make a bubble, or if it looks like the water level is not dropping when your pig is in its cage and should be drinking, it is possible that a ball is stuck.  Unscrew the top and look at the inside.  You should not see the ball.  If you do, it is stuck and blocking water flow.  Some bottles have 2 balls so you need to check even if there is a ball at the end of the tube.|`|urIm4YaBaa	Hold the bottle with one hand and start spinning the ball with one of your fingers. If your finger gets wet, then the bottle is working.<br>  <br>  Water is resting on top of the ball. When it gets spun, the wet side is facing out, while the dry side is spun against the water, making it wet. When the guinea pigs will lick the ball, it spins, thus keeping it constantly wet. In the process, they getting the water they need.<br>  <br>  It might seem like a slow way to get a drink, but it works just fine for them.|`|lNfv18Bsaa	My Guinea-Pigs have the same water bottle as yours and it works fine.

I think the balls are designed to stop the water flowing out of the bottle too quickly and the guinea pig choking on the water.I've kept guinea pigs for years and know a lot of people that have got them and i've never heard of a guinea pig choking on the ball inside. The drink bottles are obviously safe because if they were a danger to guinea pig's that would not be on the market. You can tell how much their drinking by monitoring how much water has gone since you last filled the bottle up and you should get a good idea. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|CACiIkS6aa	The ball will not fall out. When the guinea pigs tap on the ball with their tongue the water comes out. Make sure it is distilled water like we drink and room temperature. Change the water daily.

3sB49YNnaa	There is absolutely no difference among the breeds, colors or sexes on friendliness.  It depends mostly on the individual and on how well you socialize it.  Abyssinians tend to be a bit more high strung and could be a bit nippier, but even they make great pets if properly socialized.<br>  <br>  There is also no difference among the colors, breeds or sexes on smell.  None will smell if you keep the cage clean.<br>  <br>  The bottom line in choosing a guinea pig as a pet is to find animals whose appearance and personality appeal to you|`|VH98AKVgaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig</a> and <a href="http://www.cavyspirit.com/sociallife.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cavyspirit.com/sociallife.htm</a>   might help you|`|O7XDV06Iaa	Female<br>  Short and long haired are not really different, most piggies are friendly, but longhairs are harder to take care of because of their fur<br>  No, i have a brown, two all blacks, and tow blacks w white spots on their heds and all are pretty much the same niceness. also i live near the pet store and when i visit they let me pet the piggies which are all different colors and all nice<br>  females and males both need a friend. just make sure it is one from the same cage or they will fight. if you get a male and female, neuter the male or you will have 1-10 babies every few months (10 is rare). spaying the female would work too but spaying is much harder on a piggy than neutering. <br>  i have both male and female and the females have always smelled less.<br>  piggies don't bite. they may chew on your finger but this is gently and not fast so you can pul your hand away. if they do this it is because of salt on your hand. i don't think piggies actually know biting hurts u, and none of the piggies at the pet stoer or at home have ever bit me except the chewing kind that doesn't really hurt.<br>  edit<br>  btw, the only way a piggy can be unfreindly is by running from your hand so get to know one of the ones at the store befor bying it|`|OrvTG44laa	Colors and hair length won't affect the guinea pig's personality.  Both genders are friendly if properly socialized.  If you want to get both a male and a female, I suggest neutering the male.  You don't have to spay the female, obviously.  Guinea pigs will not bite if you handle them from a young age.|`|Rfj2ULibaa	The guinea pigs which are the most friendly are the ones who are handled frequently - the rest is immaterial.<br>  <br>  If you get both a male and female you need to have the male neutered so that you don't end up with lots of baby piggies running all over the place.|`|aiIS83Onaa	most males are slightly calmer but definately smell more. the females are cleanly and have attitude!<br>  usually they don't bite or if they do it is small grooming nibbles.
GIBbKJQ1aa	With leads, if you try to get a right canter lead you need to flex the horses neck slightly to the right by squeezing that rein, move your outside leg back and keep the inside leg on the girth.  If you go on the wrong lead with these aids bring the horse back to trot or they will get into bad habits.  It is often helpful to ask for canter in a corner as the horse is naturally turning and flexing their head in the right direction which helps with the canter lead.<br>  <br>  With the jumping, I used to ride a horse that got very excited.  I did the same as you- moving in a circle, staying calm and relaxed so that they don't get any more excited.  I used to turn the horse I was riding into the fence so that it was harder for him to move around:)|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	i don't jump yet, but i ride english at the canter all the time. first of all, ask your instructor. he/she might know how to help you, because they will know the horse better than we all can. <br>  <br>  every horse has a stronger and weaker side, just like how people are right handed and left handed. i would say you should just keep working her to her more difficult side, to try and strengthen it. don't forget about her strong direction, but build up her skill on her weaker side. hopefully this will help.<br>  <br>  as for your second question, i'm sorry that i don't know :(|`|Oiabe82gaa	I would do lots of work on the Lunge line. This will help her learn correct leads.<br>  Once you have a nice controlled steady trot ask for canter. If she strikes off on the correct leg let her canter for a loop and a half, if she is on the wrong lead take her straight back down to the trot, and ask her again, repeat this until she is on the correct lead.<br>  Horses learn by repetitive training, she will soon realize that when she is in the correct lead she is allowed to canter, and if she's on the wrong one she is not.<br>  Whilst in the saddle I would ask for canter in a corner. Again, maintain a nice steady trot, come into the corner, place more weight on the inside stirrup, half halt (to gain your horse's attention) and ask for canter with your outside leg.<br>  If you ask for canter with your left leg, she should strike off with her right leg and vise versa!!!<br>  As far as the jumping goes, if she is jumping well once you get into the ring I would simply take her to a quiet area when you are on deck. This way you are away from other horses and won't bump into anyone else. <br>  Your horse should be able to stand still, but this is often hard when they are excited, and often trying to deal with this will have an adverse affect inside the ring!!!<br>  Good luck!|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	What do you mean by lead? What leg shes on?<br>  And if she gets over excited, stay calm and relaxed, and talk to her to calm her down. <br>  x
xJMhQAhfaa	Training birds can be a long process and requires consistency on your part.<br>  <br>  You may want to start by spending time next to your budgie's cage, for a few weeks just talking to it and interacting with it, (think that's a her from the pic) then open the cage door for a few weeks, while interacting and let her choose to come out or not, do not bring her out.  Put her favorite treat on top of the cage if you wish. After that begin working on stepping her up, maybe with a perch rather than your hand. Also, if you hand feed her, you might want to reconsider, sometimes birds will associate your hand with food and bite because of this. You can always work on hand feeding later.<br>  I would also recommending finding a book on budgies with a section on training and reading it. Amazon is a good place to look for the book you want and read some reviews to decide if it right for you.<br>  During your training sessions, do it in a closed room, without small kids or dogs/cats around until she's well trained, it'll make catching her easier.<br>  Gently using a small hand towel can be a good way to catch a loose bird. I can't stress gently enough.<br>  <br>  I would really urge you to reconsider wing clipping.  You are not cutting the bird's wings just clipping back the primary flight feathers.<br>  Have a vet or someone from a reputable bird store teach you if you do not know how to clip wings.<br>  Remember, birds wings are built to fly in wide open spaces, like the outdoors. A fully flighted bird in a confined space can be a recipe for disaster. Smaller, lighter birds can get going quickly. I would rather my bird try to fly and make its way to the ground, than have full wings and fly headlong into a window or get hit by a ceiling fan.  I consider wing clipping in the bird's best interest, not cruel.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Birds use their beaks for anything we use our hands for. Its checking out the strength of the place it wants to sit, that takes a nip to do so, pet it where it doesnt like, it takes a nip to say stop that too. So some nips are necessarry until total trust comes along. Some animals are friendlier than others too. It just takes time, by lil boy didnt like hanging out, he would talk, he loved sitting on top of his cage, loved his mirror dearly. The one day, that he came to me and hung out and was all sweet to me finally.................was the day before he died in his cage:(<br>  I guess it takes longer when they are grown like this to get use to someone. Maybe hes just too old for that now. Try leaving his cage open and let him go check stuff out and when he comes to you, then thats the time to hang out, keep those gloves on, make yourself more rigid when holding him so he feels more secure too.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	Just be very patient with the bird, if you keep the doors and windows closed the bird will not fly away.  Do not touch it on the stomach as this is apparently a sensitive area. The bird will go back into its cage when it gets hungry or thirsty. just leave the door open. Normally these birds must be hand tamed when they are very young and this one may be a bit too old to do much with now. It is probably biting you because it is nervous and not used to being handled but if you are very patient it may become more accustomed to you.|`|F5vsY4rOaa	go to pet store and get a pole net they are fairly cheap this is the easiest way to catch any flyer that won't mind I am not sure really about how to make a parakeey stop biting I know with my tiels I just put my finger in their mouth and don't let them close it for a minute or two they quickly get the idea that I am too big to argue with If his beak is that sharp you should make sure it is chewing on it's mineral block and cuttle bone these help to file off the point a bit so they don't actually pierce the skin you have made a big mistake with your bird and it will take a while for him to trust you again but there are pros to help at <br>     Budgies.Parrotsecrets.com <br>  They have answers to questions I had never thought of and I am a long time breeder of small birds sorry I could not be of more help but I have never had a keet that was a biter I mean I have had a fright bite a few times but nothing steady and with their beaks I would be worried about hurting them so try the behaviorists at that site  and good luck|`|VdeV0jUqaa	Um, you might need to change the settings on your photo album because its set to private and we cant see the image!<br>  Female budgies are known to be more bitey than the males, and it can be really difficult to hand tame them, especially older birds.<br>  See if you can find some books on budgies, and parrot behaviour and traning either at the pet store, on the internet, or at the local library, and start to do some research into what you should do.<br>  I really dont think your bird would fly at you and bite you if you let it out of its cage- its more likely that she will fly around the bedroom- this can be dangerous, though because it would be easy for her to get scared and fly into a window and hurt herself.<br>  I know it sounds cruel to be clipping her wing but alot of the time its for the best. You can talk to your vet about wing clipping- there is a clip that you can do that still enables the bird to fly- it just slows them down a bit- it involves clipping most of the feathers right back, but leaving the flight feathers long- this is usually called a 'show clip' and its good for keeping a bird you like to see fly safe.<br>  Have you considered getting your bird a friend? Budgies are incredibly social birds and they do tend to get depressed when they dont have another budgie they can groom and cuddle up to.<br>  Good luck! It sounds like youre off to a good start- keep up the good work and I hope you have a much happier, healthier pet soon!

zdcK4FRXaa	well maybe grooming it will help. where are you located?|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	the point behind join up is helping your horse to be with you, and happy to be so. a round pen is the best place to do it. stand in the middle and swing your lunge line at the horses hindquarters. at this step your giving the horse a choice, be with you in the middle- or continue to run around the pen. now somtimes a horse will try to switch directions. so you have to make sure you are taking steps neer the horse and giving strong firm voice comands such at "Canter!" or "Get up!"strong cues. Then when you are ready u may ask the horse to change direction by stpening towards its head and saying "Switch!"in a strong voice. <br>  Now you should be looking for signals your horse will show of submission. First look at his inside ear. it should turn in towards you. then look at the his mouth. once the horse has done a licking chewing motion then turn your back on him and let down your agressive possion. Wait for your horse to join you in a middle. if your horse continues to walk around with out coming towards you, or just stops and does not walk in towards you for a long period of time, then turn and swing at the horse again. once your horse has joined u in the middle then give him a pat inbetween the eyes. and walk off, your horse show walk with you:-] that is how its done. I sugest tha you also look up some videos of people doing join up on youtube. seeing might be easier.|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	join up? whats that?
g6sNQ7p1aa	... It is possible (people have bred Nandays and Sun conures together for experiments) but I don't recommend it. Green cheeks are much further away from Nandays genetically than sun conures are and therefore any genetic mutations (and not the pretty ones) would be more likely to show and/or kill the offspring. And, more than likely, the offspring would be sterile. <br>  <br>  I used to work at Petsmart and we had a TON of people asking us if they could cross-breed certain animals of the same family (mostly fish and birds). I learned that it is possible, but very unlikely. Typically for a couple of birds to produce offspring successfully, the genus of their scientific name must be the same (for example, the sun conure is Aratinga solstitialis and the Nanday is Nandayus nenday). If the genus of the names are different (green cheek is Pyrrhura molinae) or if the general physiology of the species is different, chances are the mating will not produce anything, fetus will die, the babies will not live very long, or they will live and be sterile. <br>  <br>  Ha ha. Hope that answers your question! lol And no these two breeds have never cross bred before, at least not professionally. Also, birds will do things that a mated pair does, but it does not mean they're romantically interested in one another. They can be best buddies helping eachother out. Or, they can think they're "life partners."|`|wF52XMxAaa	The green cheek is a Pyrrhura conure and the nanday is either a Aratinga conure, or its own genus Nandayus (depending who you ask).  You might not think they could hybridize, but they can.<br>  <br>  see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mfids/3002740623/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/mfids/30027...</a> for a picture of such a hybrid.  So it is possible.  I wouldn't encourage them, though.|`|0lYFHqJLaa	Yup its possible <br>  But it probably isnt if they are two different types of birds such as  parakeets and conures<br>  But if  they're both conures they will be fine :}|`|HhXrcEARaa	Yes, they are both conures so they can, but if you do not add a nest box they wont breed.|`|as3EF0BSaa	Yes it is possible.<br>  Around here, escaped Nandays are as prolific as rats.

EBAY IT! haha|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	I'll give it you in ï¿¡'s, cos thats all I know.<br>  Bridle = ï¿¡40<br>  Bit for Bridle = ï¿¡10 +<br>  Saddle = ï¿¡140 + (depends on what kind of saddle you want; whether its tailor made, or full leather or extra comfort etc etc. I'd reccomend getting a 2nd hand saddle.)<br>  Girth = ï¿¡10 - ï¿¡40 (depends on what girth tbf; I'd buy that second hand too)<br>  Halter = (I call it a head collar ;D And they're normally about ï¿¡8 for a head collar and lead rope)<br>  Feed = ï¿¡18 for a bag of pasture mix, ï¿¡10 for a bag of chaff (if thats what you feed.<br>  Shoes = ï¿¡45 each time?

If you want a new saddle, you will probably have to spend at least 800 dollars for a decent one, but they can go up to 3-4000 and beyond.  I would say on average for new and good quality, about 1500-2000.  Absolutely do not buy those 200 dollar package deals because they are junk.<br>  <br>  You may get lucky and find someone selling a used saddle with all the fittings, but if not, saddle pads range from 15 dollars to over 100 depending on what your particular horse needs, I would guess about 30 dollars for a nice pad, 40-100 dollars for a girth, and around 50 for leathers and 30 for irons, so probably 150-200 dollars for fittings unless you find some good deal or used stuff.  Do not skimp and buy a low quality girth or leathers..buy nice ones and take good care of them and they will last a long, long time.<br>  <br>  As for a bridle, 50 dollars and up to several hundred, or less if you can find a good used one.  Don't buy the cheapest, but you definitely do not have to spend 300 dollars on a brand name bridle.<br>  <br>  You will also need a bit.  If you horse goes in a basic snaffle, you can probably get a nice one for around 25 dollars, but if he needs something more fancy it could be closer to 100.<br>  <br>  You can get a nylon halter and lead for around 20-30 bucks, or leather for 40-50.<br>  <br>  You will also need a grooming kit.  Don't buy used here.  Your bare bones basics are going to be a hoof pick, a stiff brush, a curry comb, a mane and tail brush or comb and a soft brush.. usually brushes are 5 to 10 dollars, and they often sell kits for 30-70 dollars.<br>  <br>  My guess is anywhere from 600 dollars to thousands depending on how lucky you are and how nice of stuff you want.  I would try to have at least a 1000 dollar budget, preferable 1500 dollars for outfitting your new horse if I were you.<br>  <br>  One word of advice...do not buy a saddle until you buy a horse or you may end up with a saddle that does not fit the horse.  I am assuming that you take lessons if you are just buying your first horse?  What I would do is ask your instructor to help you with outfitting him. He/she will know of people that might have equipment for sale and will be able to help you pick out stuff that will fit both you and the horse and is of the type and quality that you need for what you want to do.<br>  <br>  Spring is also the time of tack swaps so check your local horse calenders.|`|qNuynJNLaa	Well when i got my first horse a couple of years back, it cost me around ï¿¡2000, your best bet on finding the out the prices would be getting a pen, a peice of paper & a calculator, goto the website of the store you'll be buying your equipment from (e.g robinsons)  & picking out a saddle, bridle & everything else you would like then adding the prices together then either order it or go and collect it, but from the top of my head a good saddle will cost you atleast ï¿¡300 or so maybe more, a bridle somewhere in the region of ï¿¡80 - ï¿¡150, again maybe more, then halter you can get for around ï¿¡6 - ï¿¡80 depending on the make, material and so, then you have rugs, they start from around ï¿¡40 & go up into the hundreds, grooming kit's, you can pick up a decent enough one with what you need for around ï¿¡20 - ï¿¡30 it all depends where your buying, what make your buying and so, but it's not going to be cheap!|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	depending on the brand of saddle and bridle and such, and the material, and the quality, the price can vary. also, if you want to show seriously, your will need different saddles and stuff than you would just riding around for fun. some good websites for horse equipment are:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.statelinetack.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.statelinetack.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.victorycanter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.victorycanter.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.doversaddlery.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.doversaddlery.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.horse.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.horse.com</a><br>  <br>  it all really depends on how much you are willing to spend, what quality of stuff you are looking for, etc. looking at customer reviews is always helpful because on the websites they're going to tell you that the product is great, so be careful!<br>  <br>  good luck, and have fun with your first horse!|`|x787hJbBaa	I'd say between 5 and 10 thousand.

EJpiaCMQaa	Your cat will kill the finch long before loneliness will ever kill it.  I don't recommend having both birds and cats as pets.  You should either have one or the other.  I wouldn't get another finch until you get rid of the cat or keep the cat outside so it can't get to the birds.  Once you have that problem solved, then you can get another finch.  The sooner you get the finch, the better.  You don't want the one finch you already have to have much time to himself or he'll get territorial and may fight with the new finch.  Keep your cat away from the finches or get rid of it.
TdrgZwnoaa	I have two cats and a dog. They are the best of friends and sleep together at the bottom of the stairs every night. Because they are all working animals we value them as family members.<br>  <br>   The cats keep mice out of the house and the dog is our security system. The dog also keeps the cats in line when they are in the house and keeps them out of our sleeping area at night.<br>  <br>   And they are all foundlings. The dog came from an Indian reservation; one cat was the only survivor of a coyote/feral cat war; and little Thomas was found freezing to death in the engine compartment of a bus.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	it depends on the person.

Cats tend to be more laid back, calmer<br>  and independent. Dogs are sometimes a little more cuddly, too.<br>  If you want a pet that you can run with then you should<br>  get a dog. If you want a pet that will lay quietly on your<br>  lap then you should probably get a cat. Some dogs can be<br>  laid back and independent, like a cat and some cats are <br>  frisky and full of energy like a dog.

Dogs are more ready to please than cats are.  That's the reason dogs are considerably easier to train than cats. Dogs require more care and social time than cats do. If you want a more independent pet, a cat is best. To sum it up, dogs have owners, cats have servants.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	I dont think one or the other is a "better" pet.<br>  <br>  Dogs and cats are very different. <br>  <br>  I think cats are easier though.|`|qZ0310yVaa	cat for sure less work|`|oK5kVlrnaa	It all depends on the owner.

Make sure you're in the correct place to send him forward, or you're just confusing him by using the whip. Lunge him on a lunge until he learns what you want from him. Then try without.<br>  Crops shouldn't be used on the horse's butt if he's not moving. They should be used behind your leg. No wonder he kicks! I would go so far as to say NEVER hit a horse on the butt with a crop just to get him to go forward.<br>  If he kicks when you kick, it's possible, again, that you're confusing him. Do you kick him without giving him the opportunity to respond to your leg? Are you not giving him enough leg before you decide to kick him? Is he sore on his sides (meaning kicking hurts in a way that doesn't motivate him, but makes him want to get you off)? Are you pulling back with the reins accidentally without noticing when you kick? <br>  There are a number of things that could cause his kicking. Rule out his physical pain first, then look at your own actions on him. Get a trainer if necessary to evaluate how you are interacting and pick up on any subconscious clues you may be giving that are confusing him.|`|UvsyeiV3aa	Hey, So I don't know if you have a professional riding instructor but it sounds like you need the help of one. I've been riding for 12 years always under professional training and it sounds like it a behavioral issue with your horse. The first thing you should do is consult your trainer for advice and have your horse checked by a vet. Being that your 11 and I don't know your riding background you may not be able to spot that your horse is lame even the slightest bit of lameness can cause a horse to act like that. Second off some one needs to teach you the way to correctly lunge your horse it is basics that you NEVER walk up to a horse on a lunge line you make them walk and wind them in especially if you horse it going against what your asking him to do that is him challenging you and no matter how much you think you may know you horse he is still an animal. Also, horses are very sensitive judging by you calling your mother mum I going to guess you don't live in the states I don't know what the climate is like where you live but weather changes have a huge affect on horses so that can change his mood and general attitude towards things. My horse acts like some one put a firecracker up his butt when the weather changes. hope this helps I know its kind of a babble but good luck w. him hope it works out don't give up!
O60IrDMCaa	make sure on the bottom u put dishwasher liquid because it will keep the food from falling out. and it will smell better to attract the bird easier, it is also less of an eye sore.<br>  does real wonders!!!

He is sometimes sweated up before I have even mounted. <br>  I can take him out for 30 minutes or 2 hours and he is the same.<br>  We do eventing, and we often go into the Dressage ring and he looks like we have worked for an hour when it was a gentle 15 minute warm up, sometimes my wife has to meet me at the gate into the Dressage ring to wipe the sweat out of his face.<br>  We humans are the same, I used to work construction with a guy that would sweat from 7am to 4pm even when it was like 2 degrees!!!<br>  Good luck!|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Sweating is a horse's most effective means to dissipate body heat.  If the air is dry, it will evaporate and cool the body.  But if it is humid, the horse will sweat and it will not evaporate, so it remains wet there on the horse. If exercise continues, body heat increases and sweating will continue.  If the horse goes into heat exhaustion, sweating will shut down, and emergency cooling will be required.<br>  If a horse is conditioned, a workout will not produce an inordinate amount of heat production.  But a horse that is out of condition will overheat more rapidly, and sweat profusely as the body attempts to cool down.  And, again, if it is humid, the horse will overheat more rapidly.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your horse needs a gradual conditoning program, but other factors may also need to be considered. Certain metabolic conditions can lead to excessive sweating, called hyperhidrosis. Some drugs may overstimulate the sweat glands, and some toxins as well.  Diet can also play a role in the amount of heat produced during exercise, and in the amount a horse sweats.  I would consider all of the factors, including her conditioning, the air quality, diet, and potential metabolic issues that may be involved.  Your vet can help you to figure out what the problem may be.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	She could just be out of shape.<br>  <br>  If she's in great shape and shouldn't be sweating that much, you might want to get her tested for Cushing's disease.|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	i don't think its anything to worry about, its just the way your horse is. just like people, some can walk on a tredmil for an hour and not break a sweat then there are people who get on for 5 minutes and are dieing. my friend used to have a horse that would sweat like crazy, and i used to have on who i could gallop a few minutes take a break do it again, jump and go on a trail ride and wouldn't break a sweat. nothing to worry about.|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	It could be she is very unfit, or it could be she is not clipped out?

qdtU1Q1Laa	You're supposed to get boots 1 1/2 - 2" too tall as they will drop. <br>  <br>  Breaking in boots does suck, and they will hurt, but just wear them a little bit everyday and they will soon drop. <br>  <br>  I'd go with the talls (I'm pretty short, 5'6", and use talls), as if the regulars are the perfect height now, they will drop and become too short (which is worse than them being a little too tall!).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|iiNAJfGCaa	If you're going to be showing you always want to go with taller. Boots that are too short will stick out like a sore thumb. It SHOULD hurt when you first starting riding your boots and you should barely be able to bend your knee. In time they WILL drop down. Breaking in boots is awful - you'll get blisters on your heels, at the back of your knees... but eventually they'll break in to your leg and almost feel like customs. If it was me I would go back and get the tall and then just wear them around the house a little bit each day. Walk up and down stairs, keep them really conditioned, and they should break in faster.|`|GKAmSUiUaa	Go for longer ones! <br>  <br>  It will hurt to start with. Try to wear your boots a bit every day so they'll start to get the shape.|`|RoPLmd2daa	A little short is okay, as long as they're no more than an inch from where your knee bends at the back.

He is available again and I just know that it was God that worked in this situation.  I think this horse was meant for me, and Now my family plans on adopting him.<br>  <br>  I felt the same EXACT way you do right now with horses.  If you wait...you will find the most perfect horse.  If this horse was really meant for you, you will find a way to have him, but if he is gone, that horse was not meant for you to have and you will find your dream horse later in life.  (later could be from a day or two-years)<br>  Good luck!|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	What?
gJE0ujbzaa	I have not found them to be useful. The few horses I've found who went better in them than in other bits, were horses that needed some dentistry work done.  And once it was done, they were fine in other "normal" bits as well.<br>  <br>  They get chewed through quickly, and many horses learn to lean and be very heavy on them.<br>  <br>  Many people buy rubber and plastic bits, and don't realize that they are WAY to thick for the horse's mouth. The horse ends up doing some head bobbing and a lot of chewing, and they just go through the bit, and it doesn't solve the problem. If the horse can't close his mouth properly, you will continue to have problems.<br>  <br>   Many people think their horse's have "sensitive mouths", but what the real problem is, they need floating, or they have a low palette to where the bend in a snaffle pokes them in the roof of the mouth when the bit is pulled on.  Using a bit with a french link solves that problem. Many horses get pinched by O ring snaffles, which unfortunately is the most common bit to be found. Put them in a d ring, or an 0 ring that has a wide part for the ring to slide through so it doesn't pinch, often solves that problem.<br>  <br>  I've had good luck with the Myler comfort snaffles, the ones with the small barrels in the middle. There are many other types of mouthpieces offered by myler, but I have found the small barrels with the d ring sides to work best for the majority of sensitive horses.|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	They're great for horses (as long as it suits their mouth type) who have a very soft mouth and do not play with the bit. I tried a Happy Mouth bit with my TB (who plays with his bit a lot) and it was destroyed in less than a week! <br>  <br>  So, it really depends on the horse, but yes, Happy Mouth bits can be nice.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	I love happy mouth bits! I have 3 of my 4 horses in one. I find them very useful for babies and also horses that have had sever bits in the past.  <br>  My eldest sons pony came with a really thin long shanked Pelham and we now have her in a happy mouth 3 ringed gag (reins attached to the mouth piece not the rings...buying her happy mouth hanging cheek soon   <a href="http://www.frogpool.com/product-5542.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.frogpool.com/product-5542.htm</a> )<br>  HOWEVER...My cob just leans on them....he needs a metal mouth piece or he is a pig :P <br>  I would never dismiss ANY bit ...Mouth confirmation is so varied that to stick with one type is just wrong. If possible I always try a happy mouth first though :)|`|G2LtSuhgaa	My equine dentist told me never to use a "happy mouth", they do not move over the lips as smoothly as metal, and can actually cause friction burns. Therefore, I stopped using it that day. At the end of the day, a snaffle is a snaffle whether it be metal or plastic. You can buy sweet iron bits which do encourage the horse to mouth also.|`|eji2mBAlaa	My horse began avading the bit so i changed his bit from a snaffle to a french link happy mouth.  I found that he was happier working with this but again it became rough and worn very quickly.<br>  <br>  I changed the bit soon after back to a metal bit.  Its a hanging snaffle for a bit more control and helping him to understand my actions as he is young.<br>  <br>  I think that if you are going to stay on happy mouth bits, they have to be changed quite often.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.<br>  x|`|LYTftfI0aa	For young horses, Great!<br>  <br>  For older, more experienced horses, I wouldn't personally recommend them. <br>  <br>  Yes, they do go rough after a while, but my horse when he doesn't get his own way chews down on the bit, that made mine rough. Maybe it's the same situation as you?<br>  <br>  Hope i helped|`|AJovcwDCaa	I think they're ok for young horses who are in training. They might accept the bit better if it's flavored. But I would never use them for anything else. They don't come in a lot of different types of bits either. There's the loose ring snaffle and some others, but there isn't much of a choice. Plus, I wouldn't ever show in one, so I just don't take them as serious performance bits.|`|LUAzrVqVaa	My horse won't accept any sort of contact in any other bit. He has had a mullen mouth happy mouth for a couple months now and has never been better. Depends on the horse.|`|68e8f73113759339d7eb8f2b1b99cf50aa	Im all for them. There seem to be many with the oppinion that they should only be reserved for younger animals, but I ride my 15 year old, flighty TB x Connemara in one, and hes happy as larry! <br>  <br>  The lady who I bought him off had bought him wearing a run of the mill eggbutt, but swapped him into a loose-ring jointed snaffle with happy mouth, and found he reacted much better, as he has a relitivly soft mouth. I rode him in that for a while, but I compete him a fair amount at show jumping, and was finding his steering a bit off, so changed him into a jointed full-cheek, which had a startlingly good effect. <br>  <br>  There was a point where he started to get a little strong though, but instead of putting a metal mouthpiece back in, I decided just to opt for a hanging cheek. Just that little bit of poll action really helped him, and hes never been better now :]<br>  <br>  What I also love about happymouths on an asthetic level is the variety of colours you can get them in! My boys in a lilac one at the minute, which is so pretty!<br>  <br>  In my oppinion, happy mouth bits are much kinder than metal varieties. If youre safe riding in one, I dont see why you shouldnt. And regarding durability, I had to exchane a bit once due to wear and tear, but that was after a year or so of use, so Ive never really had an issue as far as thats concerned.<br>  <br>  xXx

If its new, did something in the house change?  Did you buy new furniture recently or really change anything at all?  Sometimes cats react badly to change and start getting back at people by peeing everywhere.  Did the vet check for a UTI or crystal things hanging out in the bladder?  If he has a UTI, he is not meaning to pee elsewhere, but he just cannot make it to the box in time and its painful to hold.  Get him checked out (if you already have, I apologize and you can ignore that sentence)  Have you tried changing (or recently changed) the litter?  Sometimes cats are picky about the litter (I had one that was).  If you changed the litter recently, he could acting out against the change...a sort of litter box strike if you will.  If not, try changing the litter.  He may have decided for whatever reason that he doesn't LIKE that litter anymore and would like something new.  Cats can be weird...I won't lie.  <br>  <br>  Really, the course of action would depend on whether this has been an ongoing problem his whole life, or if it just started.  If you can give a little more info I can update and give more info too :)<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I have a cat who started doing this a few months ago.  She's almost a year old - will be next month.  We never really figured out what made her start, but...to make her stop, we first scrubbed her most beloved pee-spots really well to get the smell out as best we could, then we used an odor-remover made for pets (dont know how well it works...but it seemed okay) and sprayed the crap out of those spots.  THEN, I sprinkled some cayenne pepper down.  Usually the cat will sniff around before deciding where to pee...and once he catches a sniff of that pepper, he'll run away.  I promise, it doesn't HURT him.  I would never intentionally hurt my baby.  The pepper obviously bothers them, but as long as you have LOTS of fresh cold water on hand, he WILL be okay, I swear.  It worked for my cat.<br>  <br>  Something else you can try if the pepper seems to mean :) is buy some citrus spray (most cats cannot stand the smell) and basically spray it all over the carpets and spots where he likes to pee, being careful to keep away from his litter box and food.  Your house will smell pretty and he won't want to get real close to the carpet (it won't make him stay away from you, it'll just keep him from putting his face right down on the carpet to sniff around for a suitable spot to pee).  After you do that, sprinkle some catnip around and in his litter box - so not only will he be repelled by the smell of the citrus, but he'll be attracted to the smell of the catnip.  <br>  <br>  I obviously cannot promise those will work.  But...its worth a shot :)|`|V4ljwCE8aa	if he isn't neutered, then that means she's marking his territory, and you need to get him neutered so that he will stop doing that.|`|Qw7ymfakaa	Have you got a litter tray ?<br>  <br>  It  might be an idea to have 2...one in a differnet room.|`|Z5ooMDSBaa	My cat Roxy did the SAME thing. If your cat goes in the same spots it could be because he smells his urine on it. Make sure you treat the area with urine gone or even the dollar tree brand works fine too. Once I treated all the areas she typically peed on and kept the litter box clean with a sufficient amount of litter over time she stopped peeing outside the box:). It's probably just a phase......|`|fERs7TzVaa	What worked with my cats was watching when they were doing the peeing, stopping them in time (you usually get a good idea of what they're thinking when they get that look, raise their tails... you know what I mean I'm sure.), picking them up and putting them in the litterbox. When they've done what they had to do, giving them a second to think about it, then giving positive reinforcement: stroking, praising. After a couple of weeks (yes, it takes time), they get it right most of the time. <br>  When they reach a 9-times-out-of-ten accuracy, you don't have to go through the whole routine when they are about to misbehave. Startle them, let them know you know what they're up to, and they'll most likely take their business where it belongs.

DtkLsetkaa	I think you did the right thing.  He would have been suffering from that injury and prone to so many others because of it.  It was the kind and humane thing to do.  You are now the one suffering unfortunately, but you really did make a sacrifice and not too many other people would have done that.  Please take comfort in knowing that you are a good person who made a hard choice, and you should be proud of yourself for taking as good of care of him as you did.  Good luck to you.|`|iCdnucujaa	Yes, you did the right thing.  You put him out of his pain and suffering.  You made the years he did have happier.  You are a good person!|`|hetZz4c1aa	Yes, sadly you did do the right thing.  But do remember how much you helped him and gave him a better life............your kindness will be rewarded!<br>  <br>  good luck and happy thoughts!|`|dWed21jUaa	Yes. It's hard to tame ferals. Since he  couldn't safely live outdoors, that's the best option. I"m sorry.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	It's your call............  The vet was thinking that if you released him to the wild again that he would probably die (and he would have), but if he was able to adapt to indoor living that would have given him a chance.<br>  <br>  8 years ago I was taking the garbage out at 11pm and heard a meow. It was a local stray I'd seen around for about 3 years, who had never approached me before. I brought him a can of food, which he slowly walked to and wolfed down. Then 1/2 cup dry food which he put down too.  He followed me back to the side door and I gave him some raw hamburger, not thinking his stomach was big enough but it was.  He was there the next night, and the next, always moving slowly.  When I decided a week and a half of this was enough I got him into a carrier to get checked at the vets.<br>  <br>  He had muscles in his shoulders but his hind end was incredibly weak, his jaws were puffed not from tom cat cheeks, but from pus, all four of his canines were broken off at the roots and his chest showed rips from a cat fight. Best the vet could guess from the X-rays and his condition---he'd been hit by a car and rolled, breaking his teeth, cracking his jaw, shattering his pelvis on the left side and ripping the muscle down the center of his back.  He had it happen at least a month ago, due to the fur growth coming back in. In that time he had no use of his back legs much, was pulling himself around with the front legs and could not get away from a tom cat who ripped his neck and chest up.  Yet he FED himself in this condition, enough to keep himself going till he found us.  With broken teeth he ate prey (he could not give a killing bite with the broken & infected canines, he smothered the mice and birds in his chest till they stopped moving and then cnewed what he could with his side teeth--we found this out when I was playing with a feather toy with him).  <br>  <br>  His rear leg bone had moved forward an inch and was forming a new socket, too far along for her to do anything for him on that, so she recommended food and rest. He spent 3 weeks in our basement laying on an old quilt, with food & water and a litter box. We'd go down regularly to talk to him and help him move around. By the time he was climbing the stairs he was well enough to introduce to the upstairs cats. It was exceedingly anticlimatic--he ignored them and they stood back 8' and swore at him in cat language then they all ignored each other.  <br>  <br>  He's been with us for 8 years now. It took 2 years before his back allowed him to reach that far around to clean, and before he could lift his tail higher than the level of his back. He does have arthritis in his hips, and can't run very far before it hurts, and the two different length hind legs (pelvis ball and joint) make it hard for him to jump higher than a chair seat or the couch, but he's a heck of a cat, well known over by the vets, and very very sweet.  He can endure anything, having already gone through hell with his injuries.  <br>  <br>  We gave him the chance only because he didn't stop eating, didn't give up.  Taking him to a shelter would have meant they'd put him down, so he was ours even though we already had 4 cats here.  He's indoors only, I consider him handicapped for life.  The initial vet bill for sterilizing him, taking out the broken teeth, slicing the jaw to get the infection drained, antibiotics, pain pills, X-rays etc was around $1,000.  He's one of the most 'expensive' cats we have, but I had the money and we worked with the vet and the cat.<br>  <br>  With ours it was a choice to keep him.  You make your own call on the cats, depending on your circumstances, your vet's input and what you feel could be done.  It's a hard decision to do, but it's you who make it.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	Yes.  We can't take in every unfortunate animal that crosses our path, which can be heartbreaking at times.  Your only other option was to release him back in the wild where he likely would have starved, been eaten, or killed.  I think that the care you showed him during those couple years probably enriched his life.|`|H6EhJM2Saa	To tell you the truth I had a wild cat and brought him in because of his wounds he got along well with my 2 dogs and 5 cats it took alittle while but he did. But it is ok he should be in a good place But you have learned|`|kSZstQ6Paa	Yes you did the right thing if he dies he will know that<br>  there is a human caring for him and we die happily <br>  that is if you help him not to die! call your Friends or<br>  a pet Doctor so that he can be in the right hands<br>  if you can
oNHtVHzsaa	this is fine if he gets enough action every day. guinea pigs like have a little action to keep them from being bored, but if this is the case there is nothing much you can do. i hve kept my guinea pig in the basement and she was fine, you just have to go down there often and pick him up and give him extra attention. try to figure out if ur mom is really allergic cause if she's not then it would be great to bring him back up. good luck and hope this helps.|`|3YXAZFKzaa	Guinea pigs require A LOT of attention. Putting (him? her?) in the basement could result in depression.<br>  <br>  if your mom doesnt mind maybe you should get a secong pig, thats what the people at the vet and the pet store say. i suggest buying 2 of the same gender.|`|l5jF3oxgaa	it might be best for both the guinea pig and your mom to get rid of him/her . i know that sounds crazy to you. but if you truly are worried about it than thats the best decision. or you coukld get rid of your mom. haha lol jk]|`|fi4RKcjnaa	Well you could buy a cage, then put him outside, or if you have the right type of backyard where he wont escape and no cats, dogs or carnivores birds can kill him. then you can just stick him outside. You can just tell your mother to stay away from him.|`|CACiIkS6aa	First of all, make sure you have a large enough cage. If the cage is not big enough, take it outside in the backyard daily for some running around. Your local pet store should probably have harnesses which you can attach to your pig, like leashes for dogs. Those will make outdoor activity safe. That will make him happy and won't harm your mom<br>  <br>  Your cage should have a small hutch or hiding place for your pigs. Try also to get cardboard chubes for it to run around. Some bird or rabbit toys work for piggies too. MAKE SURE that you don't give it an exercise ball or wheel like hamsters, because guinea pig's spines arent as flexable, and these wheels will hurt them. THose should keep him occupied when you're not here.<br>  <br>  You should also consider getting him a playmate. Getting another guinea pig of the same gender will make him a lot happier, because guinea pigs are herd animals and lilke to be with each other.|`|zoPxgUsRaa	you should think about getting a second guinea pig, they are very social animals and i think it would help|`|3sB49YNnaa	As long as the temperature and light conditions are OK, the basement will be OK for the cage.  Because your pig is not where you usually go, you will need to make the extra effort to pay attention to him.  We had ours in the basement for about 3 years when we lived in a house without a garage.|`|hdQvbs0naa	"He does not get as much interaction but I play with him a lot"<br>  <br>  This statement is a contradiction, and I can't really answer you because of that. I don't really understand what you're trying to get across. Do you play with him a lot, or does he not get interaction.. ? <br>  <br>  As long as you're feeding, watering and playing with him often enough he should be OK down there, although I heartily recommend getting him a friend. guinea pigs are very social, and if you aren't spending enough time with him you owe it to him to get him some company.
M1Rrir5Faa	hi, jess.<br>  my family owns miniature horses, which are just a few inches shorter than modern shetlands.<br>  they're really cheap to feed- we feed our minis 2 cups of alfalfa/bermuda pellets and about a quarter of a flake of regular hay twice a day. a shetland will probably be well fed if you give it 2 cups of pellets and half a flake of hay per meal.<br>  the cost should be about $20- $30 per month to feed one shetland. unless you're using them as a professional cart horse, they don't require shoeing. <br>  hoof trim costs can be very cheap or up to $50, depending on the farrier. the average trim, which should be done every 8 weeks, usually runs about $30-40 for me.<br>  they're usually cheap to maintain, and require little space to live in.|`|SzW9GmRsaa	Obviously the best place to start would be the breed society: <a href="http://www.shetlandponystudbooksociety.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shetlandponystudbooksociety.c...</a><br>  <br>  What a Shetland eats depends on a lot of factors.  As you ought to know if you are considering buying one, Shelties are prone to laminitis so the balance between energy input and expenditure is crucial.  You've got to give them enough that they can function in their role and do their job, while keeping their hind gut full (as you would with any horse) yet avoiding any feed that could push them over the edge.  Feeding a Shetland can be more difficult than feeding a fussy thoroughbred - don't for a moment think that just because it's small it's easy to feed!|`|iiNAJfGCaa	You don't decide what a horse eats based entirely on its breed, pony's especially.

Shetlands are smart, tough, and willful.  Because they are small/cute, people tend not to take their bad behaviors seriously, and even to encourage them to behave in ways that nobody in their right mind would allow a full-sized horse to behave.  Because they're so small, it's hard for an adult trainer to school them, so they're frequently poorly trained under saddle.  <br>  <br>  I've known a fair number of Shetlands and the only ones that were decent to work around were the ones broke to drive and used by adult horsemen who wouldn't tolerate the usually bratty behavior they show.  If they're made to behave decently, they can be decent driving animals, but so many of them are spoiled and have bad habits.
CuP846Ezaa	Stress will be the big killer now. Put her in a quiet  place on her own and keep her warm, with food and water.

I would clean it with hydrogen peroxide and then it up the best you can using an ordinary needle and  a fine thread. keep the stitches close together so that any movement will not tear the skin..|`|6KxBqnstaa	I would say clean the area well and call avian vet to have seen or to get some antibiotic for the chicken. You can also use skin glue to close the wound but bacteria from a cat or dog mouth is toxic most of the time if not treated with meds. Also will need pain meds. Good luck.

Like Pretty Kitty said, they are used to people who simply want the animal fixed, but don't much care to know what's wrong.  You actually want to know about the condition of your baby, and to get that info, you will need to get harsh and more or less harass the vet until he gives you a clear answer :)<br>  <br>  It could also be Mr. Vet's way of copping out.  He knows something is wrong with the cat, but cannot figure out what, so he's going to give the animal some generic antibiotics and hope the problems go away.  Do not let this happen!  It's a waste of money and not necessarily the greatest route to go.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	This snooty little intern at my vet's office tried that with me.  I had to ask several times before she kind of mumbled the name and then I asked her to write it down for me so I could research it and learn more.  Don't be afraid to ask.  You're paying the vet and you deserve answers.  Vets sometimes get conditioned to dealing with people who don't really care what's going on as long as they fix their pet. Your vet should be proud you're concerned and interested to know what's going on.|`|U2KdP1y7aa	When a doctor tells you have a virus it usually means you have a cold.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Was the vet referring to an upper respiratory? The're usually rhino viruses, and have to work their own way out UNLESS the nose is infected--then antibiotics can help.  If the nasal discharge is clear then nothing is usually done.

k0a1eWslaa	I don't know what you are feeding him but you should drop size appropriate crickets in the tank and leave it to eat.  This should be done at night.  He is hissing because he is scared to death.  Do as much research as possible on geckos.  Make sure his heat is correct and he has clean water and leave him alone.  What type of substrate are you using?  Sand is a very bad choice by the way.  It causes impaction and your leo can die.. There is a ton of information on geckos and how to gut load their crickets and dust them with powder.  All this information is very important to the health of your leo.  Another thing you can try if he still refuses to eat is wax worms.  These have no nutritional value but are more like a treat.  If he refuses the wax worm I would return him to where you got him or take him to the vet asap and tell him he is still not eating.  I hope this helps you.|`|Ogj9V47aaa	What are you feeding it?

Maybe he feels threatened or confused in a new enviroment!  Make his box as much like his natural habitat as possible, with a little pool, and sand, and stuff like that!  Maybe you should let him out a little, kinda like in a hamster ball!  He is still just getting used to his new home and once he is comphertable, he will be fine.  As of the hissing, he's probly trying to act tough and dominant!
8OjOmZWAaa	for me, seperating them is the best way. because you said the other one is smaller. in that case if you tried to put them together the smaller one will be bullied especially when feeding time. and it will stress out the smaller one. and may not eat. <br>  also seperating them has advantages:<br>  - to avoid bully ( like what i have said )<br>  - to avoid passing through diseases or sickness ( in case one of them has it )<br>  - to monitor them easily ( in what or how many they eat, how often they dink water, etc. )<br>  <br>  and dont put males together ( as you have said ) =)<br>  <br>  you can measure their weight in weighing scale ( digital weighing scale, to know the exact weight )|`|C0KU33Hoaa	First, take any scale and try to keep them on it long enough to get their weight.  Next, put them together and watch them for a while.  If after about a week and they don't fight, i'd let them be and just check in occasionally.  Now, as i said to another guy, make them feel at home and give them a big cage.  If they start to get territorial and fight, then separate them and try again.  If fighting continues, separate them for longer periods, or try to let them resolve it!|`|Bpc1kPqpaa	DO NOT put them together; they are like beta fish and will fight. there is a way to tell gender difference, but it is fairly hard. hope i could help|`|01nMRPHVaa	I highly suggest against this.

Then instead of talking to her then right a note & leave it somewhere you know she'll be able to see it and will read it, make sure she's in one of her really good moods before you leave the note, then go out with your friends or to they yard or something, In the note explain why you want a new horse & that just because you've got another horse you want look after cocoa any less than you already do, explain to her that it's becoming painful for your horse to be ridden and it could cause an accident, which it could to you or cocoa, if you had another horse then cocoa could retire, even if it ment selling her to someone who would give her a good home for the rest of her days, just really right how you feel about it & maybe, just maybe it could work =]|`|0uw97eiHaa	tell her that you still love cocoa, and will continue to care for ehr, but you  dont want her to be in pain evrytime you ride her. Not to mention, if one day cocoa stumbles and you get thrown off, you can get hurt. Good Luck.|`|oQmL4IdWaa	Absolutely do not sell the 30 year old horse. You owe her a retirement, and the way the horse market is right now, it is highly unlikely you will find her a good home.<br>  <br>  As for convincing your mom, I don't know what to tell you.  The economy is very bad right now, and most people are very reluctant to take on more financial responsibility.  People are losing jobs left and right.<br>  <br>  My advice would be don't promise her you will do better in school, help around the house, help your dad more, etc.. just start doing it.  <br>  <br>  As for a horse to ride, you board your current horse?  Have you asked around the barn if anyone has an extra horse they need exercised?  What about leasing another horse?|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I'm not trying to be mean, but... 30 years old is pretty old for a horse. Your mare probably isn't going to live for much longer. So you could either tell your mom that she won't have to pay for two horses for very long, or you could just hold out on the TB for a little while and enjoy the last months or years of your mare.|`|Oiabe82gaa	I guess it all depends on why your Mum isn't wanting you to get another horse.<br>  If it is because you already have a horse that's one thing but if it is because she is just fed up with horses in general that's another!<br>  If it's the first option, you will really have alot of trouble trying to get rid of an ageing horse with the onset of Cushings...especially right now during a recession!<br>  If she is just fed up of horses or has her own reasons your best plan of attack is ask your Dad to approach your Mum on the subject. At least he can find out the reasoning behind your Mum's thoughts so you can at least develop a plan of attack yourself!!!<br>  EDIT:<br>  Well, simply going on what you've told us, I'd say if money isn't the problem, and you have already offered to get rid of Cocoa, then it sounds like your Mum may think you don't deserve another horse, what other reason is there?<br>  Good luck!|`|N7I1NT6Maa	Umm, around here there are a lot of people looking for older horses to just like... have on their lawn as companions, I really don't think you need two horses, board is kind of brutal and stuff.  I think maybe if you told her you'd be willing to part with Cocoa she'd be more likely to listen... Like to a good home and everything...  30 years old, likes, she's a trooper...  Good luck.|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	Sell the 30yr Old then get a new one? That way you only have one horse?|`|M1Rrir5Faa	30 years is a ripe old age- your mom realizes that. Maybe you can look for a nice family to give her away to- but you should ask your mom first. If your QH goes to a nice home, it'll probably convince your mom to get another horse. Your mom is probably getting upset because she's attached to your current horse, and she wants to make sure that everyone can take care of each other. Just look for someone willing to take her, and make sure your mom knows that they are responsible before you drop the idea of giving your horse away.|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	How old is the TB? They can be hard to handle if you aren't very experienced. Try getting your dad to sit down with you and talk to her. Say,"Mom, let us finish before you comment, and please just keep an open mind." When I try to tell my mom stuff she is always interrupting me, but when I tell her to let me  finish before she says anything, it allows me to get the whole point across.<br>  <br>  Edit: You wouldn't be able to sell a 30 yr old horse anyways. Especially not one with cushings.
nQdGGBN4aa	I am assuming you have purchased a ticket for the cat ($50 the last time I did it in 09/2001) and will be taking her into the cabin with you in a soft sided carrier which will fit under the seat in front of you.<br>  <br>  If not, you'll have to send her as cargo - something I do not recommend.<br>  <br>  If you have purchased a ticket for her to take her into the cabin with you, do this:<br>  <br>  Your carrier will have to fit under the seat in front of you. A soft-sided carrier is a must. Others simply won't fit under the seat.<br>  <br>  Get a harness for her. The ones made for cats are not much good and can choke a cat - look at the ones for small dogs. Also get a leash.<br>  <br>  At security you want to take her out of their carrier and carry her through the metal detector. You want the leash attached to the harness so there is no chance that she will be able to get away from you. An airport is not the place to be chasing a cat and I doubt security will be very pleased with you.<br>  <br>  You could put her through the x-ray machine in her carrier but I don't want the cat to be exposed to the x-rays but the choice is yours.<br>  <br>  You can leave her in the carrier and put it through the x-ray machine but I prefer to carry the cat through the metal detector.<br>  <br>  If the metal on the cat's harness and leash set off the metal detector, have them "wand' you and the cat. If necessary, they may let you put her back into her carrier and then you can go back through the metal detector.<br>  <br>  I flew out of Boston with a cat a week and a half after September 11, 2001 and did as I've described above with no problems. One of the September 11 planes was from Boston and when I was there security was unbelievable - before anywhere else, Boston had National Guard with fully loaded automatic weapons.<br>  <br>  Not that there was actually in increase in real security, but police, state troupers, National Guard, and other security forces were everywhere.<br>  <br>  Just be ready when you get to security. Have the leash attached to the harness and be ready to put your bag, the carrier, your shoes, etc. on the conveyor belt. Get her out of the carrier and go through the metal detector.<br>  <br>  I recommend you get some incontinence pads or puppy training pads and put two or three of them on the bottom of the carrier. Have a couple of trash bags with you, perhaps in the carrier, ready for use if she urinates or defecates. With the pads, you can easily roll up the soiled pad and put it in a trash bag.<br>  <br>  Some paper towels will be handy. I rolled them up and put them in an outside pocket of the carrier - our soft-sided carriers have outside pockets which are quite handy for things like this.<br>  <br>  The cat I was transporting - it was a diabetic cat named Angel which was headed for a new home in Dallas - defecated right as we took off.<br>  <br>  As soon as the seat belt sign went off, I got the soiled pad out and into a trash bag. I went to the back of the plane and asked one of the flight attendants if they had a special place for the disposal of soiled diapers. She asked if I was the one with the baby - there was a woman on board with a baby -and I said "No, I'm the one with the diabetic cat."<br>  <br>  She told me to put the trash bag in the trash container in the lavatory.<br>  <br>  She also said that she had a diabetic cat. Consider the odds!<br>  <br>  You'll have to keep the carrier under the seat during the flight. Don't consider taking her out of the carrier. They won't like it and if she gets loose it might be quite an operation to get her back in the carrier.<br>  <br>  Unless you are making connections to another flight, it probably is not necessary to take food and bowls for the food and water with your. As a matter of fact, you might want to limit her intake of water and food before the flight to cut down on urination and deification.<br>  <br>  If you are making a connection and have more than, say, 45 minutes between flights, you could let her out of the carrier if you can find a fairly uncrowded area. Put out a pad and hang on to the leash. If it looks like she's looking for her litter box, try and get her to use the pad and then dispose of it in a trash bag.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.<br>  <br>  Update your question if you have other questions. I'll check back later to see if you have updated it.<br>  <br>  Our Diabetic Cat site is at <a href="http://www.sugarcatsimon.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sugarcatsimon.com</a><br>  <br>  You can email me via Answers if you have any questions.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes, she will need to be taken out of the carrier and the carrier scanned thru x-ray - then she is returned.<br>  <br>  I showed cats and did attend some shows that I had to fly.  My cats were used to noisy places and I just held them tight to me when walking thru and then put them in the carrier on the other side.  If your cat is not familiar with loud noises and strange places, then a harness/leash is a good idea to have on him in the carrier for safety.|`|YBcB0732aa	Take her out of the carrier after you take off you shoes and stuff to get your stuff x-rayed.<br>  <br>  You go through the metal detectors holding you cat. After  the carrier is  scanned put you kitty back in the carrier.<br>  <br>  Have id tag on your cat on a harness and have a leash too.|`|hB1SkPqRaa	You need to contact the airline you are flying on. They have guidelines for exactly what kind of carrier you will need to fly her in the passenger cabin. They have very specific measurements. Also asked about getting a health certificate  from your vet and how many days prior to the flight you'll need to do that. She must be up to date on vaccines. No they will not let her out of the crate. You may also want to check into getting her a microchip just in case, God forbid someone does for some reason open the carrier or worse yet drop it and it pops open.<br>  ** I see other posts where people are telling you to take her out of the crate. DO NOT DO IT!! She will be frightened enough. The last thing you need while travel ing is a scared cat clawing to get away from you and a bunch of strangers chasing her through the airport!!!|`|oT71QN8Raa	She doesn't - she goes with the suitcase before checkpoints.  Bring her in a carrier so the airport people can clearly see she isn't "luggage."  When you get to the counter where they weigh your bags that will be going into the cargo section of the plan, they'll take kitty.  You won't be able to take her onto the plan with her.<br>  <br>  ETA:  The airplane plane company is allowing her onto the plane?  ...strange considering people could be allergic to cats and THAT's a lawsuit waiting to happen.  You may need to double check that.  There's a special place on planes for animals.  You may HAVE to part with her and you need to consider that option...
vBIwaQ0qaa	If there are any shelters near bye find out if they can take them off your hands. They might even be able to hook you up with a wild life rescue place too.<br>  <br>  I'm so glad you rescued them too.|`|GWINq3Owaa	i kept little baby bunnies once when my dog killed the mother. Sadly they all died even when i tried to feed them and everything. I'd say, call a shelter that takes in those kind of animals. :) good luck!|`|e55cjnbJaa	You are very kind. Please give them to a nature place, NOT a regular animal shelter. When you give them to a nature place, the people will free the rabbits as adults and won't put them to sleep. Please PLEASE give them to a caring shelter so they can be freed someday.|`|R4IWxA0Xaa	Are their eyes open. If so, they don't need their mother. If not take them to a wildlife rehab. clinic. If their eyes are open you could take them to a quiet field or park and release them.|`|rS6E7Mfkaa	i would say to take them to the closest veternarian and see if he would take them or if he could give you some help with taking care of them|`|1f90bdc9c249078664dd86668855ce29aa	with a white wine sauce.
IuYekkPVaa	Celia Hammond always need good homes for cats and kittens as do Cats Protection.  Don't know what part of London you're in, but here's the contact details for all cat rescues in the UK, just click the map for east or west London.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catchat.org/adoption/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catchat.org/adoption/index.ht...</a>|`|m01ijLFUaa	Why not visit a rehoming center, like battersea : <a href="http://www.battersea.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.battersea.org.uk/</a><br>  <br>  They have pets that would be very suited.<br>  <br>  :D|`|5KcUyLFRaa	Why not adopt one from battersea or an animal home. There are so many little kittens that would love a loving home there.|`|BY0cV4kRaa	Go to the do the dog & cat home in London & buy one.|`|43fbfcc084aaf5d39dcae786aa43b791aa	I can understand the difficulties you're having finding a kitten, as it isn't quite "kitten season" yet. April is when it all really kicks off, particularly after a cold winter like we've just had. I'm currently trying to find a kitten close to London too, so can tell you what I've been told - phone all the rescue centres you find on CatChat (someone else has given you the link already) and then be prepared to phone every week or so. Be aware that you may have to have a home check for some of the charities - you could get that out of the way while you're waiting. You could also check the local paper and bulletin boards in supermarkets and newsagents for kittens.<br>  As an alternative, why not get your nan looking through the adult or juvenile cats?  There are photos of them on the rescue sites linked from catchat. She might just fall in love with one of them, and you'd be giving a good home to a cat that desperately needs one.<br>  Best of luck!|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Part of your problem is cats are seasonal breeders, and we are only just coming into kitten season.  There will be more around in a few weeks...<br>  <br>  The rescues others have posted are great ideas.  However most will ask more than ï¿¡50 I think.  It's value for money as it will usually include vaccinations, chips and a voucher for neutering, so you will save money in the end.<br>  <br>  You don't say how old you are, but if you are not an adult most rescues will not let you adopt.  They may also have a problem with someone adopting as a gift: they will probably want your nan to choose a cat herself.  How about you see if any of your relatives would like to get a cat/kitten as a joint present for your nan so you have a bit more money to play with?  Then rather than get it yourself, draw her a nice 'gift certificate'.  Then you can all go to a rescue together later and your nan can choose the cat or kitten she'd like.|`|RWELyHy6aa	sry not me
f0dXmrJiaa	yes they lay everyday exept for when its cold or any major changes happen|`|rQlzfHqraa	Yes. In warm weather they lay eggs every day. Egg farms add extra light to extend the day and chickens lay more eggs thinking it to be a long summer day. Egg production is also increased by maintaining a warmer chicken house when weather is colder. Incidental, an Australorp hen laid 364 eggs in one year.|`|BHDXE76oaa	they dont lay it everyday only when they like have it|`|EZzHjm8Vaa	generally they would lay eggs like a normal bird a few times a year, but since they take the eggs away it is natural for a bird to keep laying eggs because it wants a chick. Chickens that lay eggs are only used from between 6 months and a year because it puts a large strain on their bodies.|`|YhH0PNupaa	A hens cycle can be from 18-36 hrs long. So she may lay daily or she may lay every other day. If they are overly disturbed, they will quit laying, it is gets cold, they may quit laying. For some reason mine don't lay very well if it is windy out.|`|AA10356572	depends on the breed of chicken and the time of year.. <br>  here is a great link on chickens as pets..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Unusual-Pets-Chickens.76299" rel="nofollow">http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Unusual-Pet...</a>|`|R4IWxA0Xaa	In the warm weather, yes, usually every day. But in the winter some chickens lay eggs and some don't. Ours are a little spoiled and have heat lamps, a heater, and a day light in their cage. That could help. You also must make sure they have enough food and water.
OrvTG44laa	The first two can not be used.  Do you see those cups on the side of the cage?  Gerbils can push those out and escape from the cage.  It's happened to me many times with my old hamster.  The third one also looks a little small.  I honestly don't suggest using any of them.  <br>  Get a cage that is at least 1 foot by 2 1/2 feet.  That should be good for two gerbils.  Then put some tubes in there.|`|uC2OAc4Kaa	I think you should not got any of thoes. Thoese are for hamsters. So I would decide for a 20 gallon aquarium. Or get a storage bin and cut miny slips so it has ventalation. So you can have a massive house for them!|`|74887b1a75edcde7cf7361c41613e27daa	I think the best environment for a gerbil is a 20 gallon aquarium filled partly with cedar chips.   Put an empty kleenex box in it add some paper towel rolls, toilet paper rolls and watch them create a unique environment.   Keep giving them paper rolls to chew as well as empty paper boxes.   When the tank is full empty it and start again.  You will need a lid for the tank.   It will be cleaner than a cage and they will be stimulated by chewing the cardboard.  I had gerbils years ago and many of them lived 5 or 6 years.|`|AA11902187	Just to let you know, the first one and the last one are way to small for two gerbils. Those cages would be okay for one gerbil, but probably not two.<br>  <br>  The second one would be the best, but it's still a bit too small for two. The smaller the cage is, the more gerbils want to fight because they don't have enough space. If you do end up getting this cage (which I do not suggest) make sure you put another place for one gerbil to sleep so that if they get in a fight they can sleep seperately. I know it already has one sleeping place at the top, but add another at the bottom.<br>  <br>  The BEST cages, in my opinion are:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3057122" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  It's wire and provides proper ventilation. It also is large and has plenty of room to run around in! Easy to clean too. Price: $44 (you would also need a wheel, and other cage accesories. They're not included.)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2754666" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  It has a bunch of levels for your gerbils to explore and tubes to run through too! Price: $52<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2751774" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  ****THIS ONE IS THE BEST***<br>  This is called an aquarium topper. You connect it to a 10 gallon aquarium. Now the gerbils can run in the tank, and can climb up a ladder into a wire cage! There is SO much room to explore and easy to clean too. Price: $30 for topper; $15 for aquarium.<br>  <br>  If you cannot get that cage ^ up there, then I would go for the one that is second on *your* list.<br>  <br>  *kiwi*|`|GMvzUYbSaa	They're all too small. I would get a 20 gallon tank, or make a bin cage. Those cages are for dwarf hamsters!|`|3e0rDOWTaa	they are all too small in my opinion, but out of those the 2nd one is best.|`|bMnBDVQBaa	Let me tell you, none of those cages are suitable.  Anything that is plastic is unsafe for rodents, especially gerbils.  Gerbils need to dig and burrow...none of those cages can provide their natural needs.  They WILL chew through those Critter Trail cages.  Those cages may look "cool" but they are not practical and they are not large enough for two female gerbils.<br>  <br>  I would purchase yourself a nice 20 gallon long or tall aquarium and fill it 3/4 of the way with bedding.  Mix some timothy hay in with the bedding and give them plenty of cardboard.  They will be digging tunnels and it is very fun to watch and rewarding knowing that you are giving them what they want.<br>  <br>  Do not give them any plastic houses, just wooden houses or some reptile logs.  Also, do not purchase any Snak Shaks for them...the ingredients are horrid and a lot of the ingredients are actually harmful!<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.
zguucR8yaa	Irresponsible.<br>  I'm sure you realize you've contributed to the surplus population of cats.<br>  It's people like you there are thousands of cats and kittens put to death in shelters every year. Why don't you take a little trip to the local shelter and look at all the dead cats and kittens that were healthy, but not enough homes available because of people like yourself.<br>  Ever thought about spaying her?|`|uwCcIY8Aaa	When the cat's breasts and stomach become bigger. The cat will eat and sleep alot more than usual. You could always take  it to the vet. The amount of kittens can be determined then but they usually have 3-7.|`|srjPOxW7aa	The belly should be hard or firm, and yes it is common for them to cry Meow) a lot. Yeah we have way too many cats (and dogs) being put down every day. Please spay your cat, if it's a financial issue there are resources (organizations,etc.) that will pay full or a partial price to have it done.|`|zv8QaMe1aa	So you've been down this route before, and you STILL haven't had her spayed?  And you were letting an unspayed cat outside?<br>  <br>  Sorry, but your vet can likely tell you how many kittens are in there, but without being able to feel her belly nobody on the internet is going to know how many there may be.<br>  <br>  Take her to the vet to be checked out.  They can tell you if she's pregnant, how far along and how many kittens.... and if she's not pregnant, or barely pregnant, they can spay her.|`|6BBVOgmqaa	I preseume your cat is indoor/outdoor cat.<br>  First try to determine when she is in heat.  She will cry a lot.<br>  If not keep an eye on her belly and then watch the nipples get bigger.<br>  She will want to eat more near the end and may or may not cry out.
Eo07UMsRaa	You need to get her to a vet ASAP yellow gums indicate liver problems, she could die from liver failure.|`|AA11457471	Yellow gums are a definite indication that her liver is not functioning properly! That's a serious problem.<br>  <br>  You really do need to take her to the vet & keep her indoors till she's much better.|`|qI12jcVpaa	GET HER TO A VET FOR HER HELP! Please do this!!!!!!!|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Some things are vet emergencies and some are not. This most definately is. Your cat is jaundiced if she's got yellow gums, which is very bad.<br>  <br>  Contact your animal shelter, they know of low cost options.  Doing nothing will not help your cat. Vitamins don't fix something this severe.  Your cat has infection and a full body jaundice problem that needs to be addressed soon before you lose her.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi there are a few things to consider once a cat is bitten they can develop really bad infections, also feline leukemia if your cat is not vaccinated for this.  Cats tend  to get abscesses really easy from bites.  If she has yellow gums it almost makes me think of liver problems also.  If she is not eating and has lost a lot of weight she needs to be seen by a vet.  Vets will take payments you just need to set down and talk with them.  I'm afraid in this instance vitamins are not going to help.  You could also contact you're local humane society and see if there is any way they could help you.  It's worth a try.  Good Luck!|`|keIqjnijaa	Take her to a Vet Centre immediately. Or your cat WILL die.<br>  <br>  Yellow gums indicate liver disfunctioning.<br>  <br>  Don't make this poor cat suffer before it's too late. ;(<br>  <br>  Get the money. SOMEHOW. Save your cat.

hvrw02Egaa	I used to have the same problem when I had a pool. My mom would take a jar, fill it with water, scoop the eggs into it, and relocate them. You can put them either in a terrarium or in a nice, clean pond! Good luck :)|`|g4EZib5Vaa	Just put them in a fish tank and put them up on Craigslist when they are hatched. Plenty people would like a healthy baby frog or more. You can find a good tank to put the eggs in real cheap on craigslist as well. I hope you can save them and give them homes.<br>  <br>  Even if there are 100 left it is still bad. It is like saying" Oh, if I die or my family dies it doesn't matter because there are so many people left anyway." So try not to damage them.|`|R4IWxA0Xaa	Don't try to keep that many if you keep any. Most of them die quickly. Scoop them into an aquarium or tub and relocate them to a local pond or body of water.|`|cZbRmV5raa	i used to have the same problem but yeah we still have it but i havent seen any frogs yet this yr i used to just leave them and like i made my dad not put cemicals into the pool so that when they htched i got all of them out and took them and put the in like a pond or something or we put them in this huge fish tank that had like 2 or 3 in of water and them a place that was dry so they could breath when they got were the wernt td poles anymore|`|01nMRPHVaa	With a strainer, simply scoop them out. You can keep them or let them go in another pond. <br>  <br>  It really depends on what you want to do.  You could keep them untill they are big (when they have legs etc) or keep some for life. :-)<br>  <br>  Frogs can be a fun for people that want a fairly easy pet.<br>  <br>  Edit: There's soo many eggs. I mean if you damage one, theres still what 100 left? Also you should remember not all would live in the wild.
QbJ04Zqiaa	Are you sure it was the whole claw? My cats lose the outer part of theirs sometimes. It looks like a whole claw, but it's not and they do grow back.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	It may.  If the nail bed is still there, it could grow back.  But there's also a chance that the nail may grow back deformed.  So keep a close eye on things.  Maybe take him to the vet to be checked out.|`|S4soZUFCaa	If he lost the whole claw, he's been declawed and it's in cat heaven.|`|zv8QaMe1aa	I've never heard of a cat losing an entire claw without some kind of serious trauma, or surgery, involved......  chances are it was just a sheath and the claw itself is intact and will continue to grow.|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Not sure, he has 4 more. ;)|`|OjXAcwJPaa	no|`|AJH7TiAmaa	no that happened to me. didn't grow back.<br>  <br>  sorry charlie.
UNFxjNHkaa	Is he fixed?  He may be running away to mate.<br>  <br>  Also, you should have him treated for fleas.<br>  <br>  Putting him up for adoption would be the wrong thing to do.  Trying to at least fix the problem would be the right thing to do. <br>  <br>  Please tell your mother that pets are not disposable.  When your family got the cat it was a serious commitment.  Do you know how many shelter cats are put to sleep everyday because there aren't any homes for them? THOUSANDS.<br>  <br>  Please try to change your mothers mind.|`|9RuBwanoaa	your mom gives up on your cat so easily?<br>  <br>  if you think it has fleas buy it flea medication.<br>  <br>  is it neutered? maybe its out finding a girlfriend.<br>  <br>  this is what happens when uneducated people get pets. its quite upseting.<br>  <br>  buy him toys and keep him entertained inside. and make sure hes not around when u open the door. it wont kill you. and get him neutered if he isint|`|U7SnmcxYaa	Stop letting him out, give him a bath, and then get some really good flea medicine.|`|quPY9x7qaa	have him fixed..... he's on the prowl and probably fighting other male cats.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi your kitty is doing what they call "tom-catting" around evidently there is some female cats in the neighborhood that he is checking out.  Losing the fur could be many things, cat fights with another dominant male, mange from another cat, ringworm if it's coming out in a circle, cats do shed but not in mass amounts at a time, thyroid problems.  If he has fleas he will be scratching a lot and that is a simple fix they have the tubes of liquid that you can buy and put right between their shoulder blades for such things.  The one way to help with him running away is to have him neutered.  The hormones will totally decrease and he won't be wanted to chase after females.  If the hair continues to be lost check with a vet.  Good Luck!|`|zv8QaMe1aa	I'd try to escape if you kept me locked in a garage too.<br>  <br>  Has he been neutered?   If not, that explains it all.... it's mating season and he's out looking for females in heat and fighting the other males..... bad, bad idea..... he could pick up not only fleas, but mites that can make his hair fall out and infect his ears, but deadly diseases such as feline leukemia and feline AIDs.... as well as adding to the stray cat population and the number of animals that will be killed in shelters this year and in future years as well.<br>  <br>  He needs to go to the vet, be tested for fe-leuk and fe-AIDs, have his vaccines updated and be spayed.... then he'll settle down and won't be running out carrousing any more and you can stop locking him in the garage and let him back in the house.|`|AA11457471	Have him neutered ASAP, make sure he's current on his vaccines & pick up some Frontline or Advantage from your vet's office to make sure he stays flea free.|`|AA10628838	He probably does have fleas, but the fact of the matter is he would be better off with someone who isn't going to keep him locked up in the garage. No socializing with him will cause him to become feral. Besides that , it doesn't sound as if he is neutered which would help the problem of him running off. I totally agree with the others about him needing a bath and putting on flea medication.
FQyeGsIyaa	I have bad allergies.  No cat is good for me. I haven't heard that the American Curl is "better" than others.  The ones that are more commonly referred to as being 'less" problematic are Rexes and Siberians.  However, I still react to these cats too.  I'm taking 3 drugs a day to live with my cat.  Think for awhile before you ask anyone to possibly do that.  It would be better to wait until you're out of the house.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Not that I know of.  I've never heard of them being low shedding.|`|0mb78CiWaa	American curls are like anyother cat, they are going to shed. If you frequently brush and groom the cat it should be fine.

paaozogGaa	this was my very first horse show with my instructors horse Hy-Ho<br>  She was way to fast, not collected,head was way to high, she was in heat, but at least my outfit looked good.

zRzKhgJkaa	By owning my own hamster, I noticed that my hamster likes to constantly groom himself. His grooming looks a lot like he is scratching his head and his back. To be safe, have a vet check at the wound, and make sure he isn't scratching the wound. If he is scratching the opposite side of his wound, than it is probably just grooming. Then again the little hammy might have a skin diease, and I highly advise you to check with the vet first to make sure its nothing serious.|`|GMvzUYbSaa	The would may be itchy. Whenever I get scabs they always itch :P If it continues when the wound is healed, call a vet. And double check to make sure he's not just cleaning himself.
xYTagSIyaa	Pregnant cats rarely want to play.  They like to be reassured.  I like to give treats like boiled chicken pieces all bones removed and tiny bits of tuna and the water the tuna comes in.  These are nutritious treats that help her and will help her get used to you and accept you as a friend.  I don't think there is anything wrong with a small amount of catnip, if there are no sticks that can get caught in the throat.  I would try brushing her gently and petting her often.  I would put a television with an animal show on for her to get used to having people about and the sounds of the human voice.  She will need more rest than normal as she will be busy enough later.<br>  Good luck!|`|1eYQW0XEaa	i wouldn't give her cat nip cause it might be like when a person does that.
zv8QaMe1aa	Sounds like a normal cat to me!<br>  <br>  She missed you... and she was miffed that you left for a bit... she'll get over it and be back to normal soon.<br>  <br>  Cat's are very good at letting us know when they're unhappy with something we've done.... they snub us good for a while... then they get over it and are full of love again.|`|OEATSehSaa	she probably missed you and now she is holding a grude against you|`|r8KjAxH5aa	Your cat most likely just missed you terribly. Most cats could care less, unless you have a strong bond with it.|`|d92NcQBKaa	When I go away to summer camp every year my cat freaks out...all week every night she meows and yowls.  But as soon as I come home she acts like I never left and wants to be left alone.  Your Cat sounds normal to me...|`|4lB9aEH5aa	Sounds pretty cat normal to me.|`|GpeVy3gCaa	maybe your cat is pregnant. it happened to a friend of mine!
NNxLypgaaa	It's fine. There should be no problems leaving out for that brief a period of time.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I don't like wet food sitting out for more then 30 mins.  But if they are doing ok with your feeding plan, then I guess its ok.<br>  <br>  Personally I feed mine 2 meals a day - only kittens younger then about 5 months would need a 3rd meal.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Canned foods can be left out all day/night. Even when it hardens it isn't bad to eat. Your other cats should thank the one that got sick and you are lucky and should thank you vet. There is NEVER a reason to feed dry food as it just isn't good for cats.<br>   Stay away from gravy flavors.<br>    Wellness which is top of the line sells canned that are 12 1/2 oz for around 2.00 making it cheaper then fancy feast if bought that way|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	I feed my cat twice a day - he will leave some if I give him too much.  Real chicken a couple of times a week. Wet food when I sense he is not so hungry.<br>  I work on the premise that if he cleans his dish up each time - he is getting enough (and the food is never standing).      Even we humans should not gorge until we are bloated.|`|Ema8Rxi5aa	Leaving the food out is not a good idea because canned food will spoil if it is left out for more than 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  Note that adult cats probably should only be fed once or twice a day (I feed mine twice ... they're too cute when they beg to only feed them once!). You should be able to break the habit of them waking you up every morning if you just ignore them until their regular feeding time though.<br>  <br>  Also, there's a possibility that you're giving your cat too much food if they're not eating it all. There is a really good formula to determine how many calories a cat should get at www.catinfo.org. It's on the obesity page - but isn't necessarily for obese cats. Good luck and congrats on switching to wet food!
k9gC23apaa	The UVB light is generally a long bulb, there is supplied through pet stores.  The UVB will give the bearded dragon UV rays (which the same as the sun produces). Which is crucial for healthy growth and bone structure.  The UVB light should be the same length as your tank. Next, a heat lamp ! DO NOT USE A NORMAL 60 WATT LIGHT BULB !  These bulbs can be purchased at a pet store, generally they come in a red color, white color, or even ceramic.  The wattage depends on the size of your tank.  Bearded dragons live in desert areas, it is very important to make sure their tank stays in the 90's low 100's.  Your tank should consist of a hot side and a cool side.  So here's how you set it up.  Your UVB light stays across the top, this should stay on 8-12 hours a day.  Heat Lamp, (if a red bulb or ceramic you can keep this on 24 hours) The ceramic is nice, because no light is produced. Now whichever side the heat lamp is on, you should also have a under the tank heater, these are also found at pet stores.  The heat pad sticks to the bottom on the tank.  This heated side of the tank, is where your dragon will bask.   You should place a branch (also purchased at pet store, do not use a branch from outside, they harvest mites). And possble cave/hiding spot.  These should be located at the hot side of tank.  On the opposite, you should need a dish for water.  If you are getting a baby bearded dragon, then make sure you have a shallow dish, so he/she can climb in and out of it.  Bearded dragons will do good in pairs, I would recommend two if you are getting babies.  So they keep each other company.  Oh yea, bedding if you are getting babies use a small rabbit pellet for bedding.  Do not use calci sand , calci sand can cause a blockage on these little bearded dragons.  Once they are larger in size, you can switch to calci sand.  Diet- Greens such as collard greens,mustard greens, kale, spinach, turnip greens. Fruits- banana, apple (if giving fruit, give maybe every 3-4 weeks)  Greens- you can feed daily.  Also make sure to feed crickets daily.  You can also feed mealworms.  Waxworms (feed sparinly) wax worms are very fatty. Use as a treat. Hope I was helpful.|`|NVgXA4hzaa	60cm uvb stick and about a 80 to 90 watt basking bulb.<br>  and if you want to have a heater/basking light for night get an infrared light bulb hope it helped.|`|01AdxToLaa	HE WILL NEED A LIGHT SOURCE THAT GIVES HIM BOTH UVA AND UVB RAYS IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THEIR BONE GROWTH AND HEALTH I BOUGHT MINE AT A PET STORE THEY RUN ABOUT 8-10 BUCKS|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	You want the UVB bulb to run the length of the tank. The basking bulbs can be simple household bulbs, you just have to experiment to get the right temps. A digital probe thermometer works really good as you can put it right where you want to get a reading. On one of my 4ft tanks I am running a 100 watt for the heat for the basking area but in another part of the house it is taking 2 -75 watt bulbs. See what I mean about experiment with them.
l42UDjFGaa	You should just be honest and tell people you're asking about yourself (specifically looking for what you do well) instead of pretending and concocting this story. You already posted these videos of your horse and wanted to know how we thought you were doing with him.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Atixgj2gAkZ5Iut.y8BW_uOQ.Rd.;_ylv=3?qid=20090307070619AAG0gcH">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Pan's Mom ~ I'm with you. I didn't even comment on the riding ability because this question is an obvious attempt to fish for compliments. It may work for some to say, yeah, this rider is good because some trainer supposedly says she is. I see a lot of issues with this rider that PM nailed on the head.|`|6GehblM3aa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmoQ5X0k1yOU9K.ITDtNjQzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307081243AAN5nUg&show=7#profile-info-FxrV0QS4aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  It's hard to really observe her from the video, but she looks pretty nice position wise of what I can tell.|`|YtBzRAxMaa	Whoever posted this video has sped it up. <br>   If you pause it over the second jump the riders lower leg is WAY back - which would be "ok" if the jump was of any height - these are tiny jumps. I would get her toe turned more forward and not out to the sides.<br>   The canter needs to have hands following the horses head - unless you are holding him back?<br>   Her knees are good but if that horse swerved she would come off - she is not centered nor balanced - just gripping.<br>   Get a new trainer if yours is telling you how great this rider is - this kid is doing just fine , but is not at a level to be copied yet.|`|G0KKfXMUaa	Haha this video has been used a few times. Oh well.<br>  <br>  And yes, overall, the video isn't very good. But you can still see what she's doing correctly.<br>  <br>  Well, her leg is VERY good. It's still, strong, and is correctly positioned. This is because she has good contact with her leg and the horse. (a lot of no stirrup work helps develop this)<br>  <br>  Her hands are still. She doesn't allow them to bounce up and down with the horse, and her reins are a good length.<br>  <br>  When she jumps, she does not get left behind, or get in position too early. And she also does not lean on the horses neck over the jump (which everyone now a days seems to think is correct, its not). And over the jump, her leg stays still.<br>  <br>  And for jumping, she is not leaning too far back, she's sitting up tall, but slightly foward for the jumps.<br>  <br>  Have fun riding with her =)|`|CgEjK7NGaa	To be honest, these videos are terrible.  I know how you feel, I'm far better with visual aids myself...but these are not good examples for learning.<br>  <br>  There should be more clear, side-view shots of her.  That's the only way to correctly see her position. <br>  <br>  Request some better vids, or look up some better ones online. :):)|`|AsBbERL2aa	She has a very good position, her legs are kept still, and she releases really well over the jumps.<br>  <br>  She doesn't move her hands with the horses' neck as he canters, but she should.|`|raH57MUjaa	The videos make it very hard to study her positioning that well, but if you notice she is very still (in her hands, legs, torso, etc) yet she still moves with her horse. What it really comes down to is keeping your body in position, while still moving in rhythm with your horse! If you are able to, practice riding bareback! It really helps you gain an independent seat quickly! Good Luck!

6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	NO NO NO please don't pull it. You will cause damage to the scales underneath. Do as the other say and buy some of the spray shedding aid and it does help. I have some but rarely have to use it as the warm soaks do the trip. Sometimes it takes forever for the skin to fall off but you are the one that has to be patient as not to harm your dragon.|`|NVgXA4hzaa	DO NOT HELP IT SHED because if you help it shed it will next time not properly know how to shed and will die.<br>  recommend you to buy shedding aid it is spray to help them shed.|`|e55cjnbJaa	Whatever you do, do not and i repeat DO NOT help it shed, you might peel off healthy scales.

BEARDED DRAGONS RULE!!!!!|`|01AdxToLaa	NEVER NEVER PULL THE SKIN AWAY!!!!!!! IT CAN CAUSE A HORRIBLE SKIN INFECTION TO THE LIZARD. LET IT FALL OFF ON ITS OWN
SzW9GmRsaa	A simple "good morning" should suffice.  "Hello" is far too informal for the showring!<br>  <br>  You should always try to correct a wrong strike off - coming back to trot and trying again points out to the judge that you know you're wrong and are attempting to fix it, rather than choosing to career round on the wrong leg pretending nothing is wrong!|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I don't know about dressage, but in saddleseat you're supposed to stop and pick up the correct lead. You mess up both ways, but if you fix it at least the judge knows you know you made a mistake.|`|gbd4PMwfaa	I have never heard of anyone talking to a judge before. You should always salute, whether it's a jumping class or dressage. Just stop facing the judge, drop your left hand and nod your head. Good Luck.|`|6GehblM3aa	During a dressage show, you should smile and say hello to the judge before you  start the test.  Sometimes at rated shows, you might have to tell the judge your number, but always say hello (or good morning or good afternoon would be acceptable).  After the test, remember to smile and thank the judge.  If you end up on the wrong lead, you should bring them down to trot and try again.  This happened to me during a test once and I didn't do anything about it and kept on going.  After the test, the judge told me when that happens, I should bring him back down to trot and pick up the correct lead, rather than having him go round on the wrong one.|`|xsNaCNBaaa	Before a dressage test while you are going around the outside of the ring it is polite to smile and say "good morning" or whatever is appropriate to the judge before you start if she looks at you as you go by.  if she isn't paying attention don't worry about it.  once you go in the ring and start your test - no talking.  when you are finished and after you have halted at X, you can walk forward all the way to C and say "thank you" to the judge before exiting.  that is considered polite.  <br>  <br>  If you pick up the wrong lead you will have to fix it.  if you don't fix it you will be counted as doing that movement wrong and the judge will ring the bell and give you a penalty and make you try again.  Keep trying until you get the correct lead.  Your score will drop if you do pick up the wrong lead, but that is better than having a penalty score added if you don't fix it.|`|LplwlGzMaa	You don't say anything to a judge in dressage or show jumping. In dressage, you follow the test. If it says to halt at  X and salute then thats what you do. In show jumping I have been taught to give a salute or a nod of some sort at the judge (depending on what level/type of show it is). I WOULD NOT talk to the judge unless they talk to you first. They are there to work, not start up a conversation.<br>  <br>  Again, I have been taught to fix an incorrect lead if you have to space/time but do not get so wrapped up in fixing it that you blow the nexgt manuver too. Fixing it shows that you understand that something is wrong and are not just wandering around a ring on a horse without knowing what is going on.
xJMhQAhfaa	Once a year in the spring.<br>  It is not unusual for a female to retain sperm from the male and do what's called double clutch. She'll lay a clutch of eggs, then after a couple of sheds, lay another clutch. Keep her well fed and get a book on corn snakes, like "Cornsnakes in Captivity" for example for more details.
10z4YDd7aa	In theory, you can keep virtually anything in captivity as long as you see to it's needs and I dont see why not a toad.<br>  <br>  However, why would you want to? <br>  There is a moral issue of taking something out of the wild (if that is what you were intending), and the other issue of it actually being illegal.<br>  <br>  If you want an amphibian to care for, try searching for a reptile refuge in your local area and giving a homeless one a good home, or alternatively, there are plenty of shops now stock exotics and you could buy a frog or toad.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and please make the right desicion, not an illegal and morally unsound one! <br>  Good luck!|`|GI27dKIkaa	NO YOU CAN'T !<br>  <br>  ALL British reptiles are now PROTECTED SPECIES !<br>  <br>  There are SERIOUS penalties (fines and/or imprisonment) if/when you get caught !|`|9886899d6f135552d9c3c4f7e401043daa	Are we talking tied up, gagged in the shed type captive? <br>  Or are we talking as a pet keep it in a tank with mud and humidity and cabbage type thing.|`|NtFWoBHsaa	Let the thing go be a toad.
u65h6DN6aa	Have you sat down and had a nice long chat about it? They might think that you aren't ready for a commitment like this, so show them how responsible you can be by doing lots of little things without being asked eg cleaning the house, offering to babysit your siblings so they can go out together etc|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	i was like "would rather me ride for free and basically own a horse for free? or would you rather pay for lessons one a week?"<br>  or have a nice talk to them about it. or have your cousins fill your parents in on how its a great opportunity<br>  <br>  good luck!
m1nbmzataa	ur horse needsa huge atitude adjustment!!!!!!!!!!!! do urself a favor and introduce ur horse with a whip!! idk where to start... umm... ok 1st of all when u r rideing him and u kick and he shouldnt even think about kicking or bucking or rearing and if u wanna use a crop, u r boss! if he dont like it then to bad for him! and voice commands he should listen to. sometimes when ur lungeing him and he bucks and kicks, that may mean that he just has a lot of energy in him. but if he trys to kick at u when lungeing, or just kicks and bucks in a violent way theres a problem. and he should not turn around to where his butt is faceing u and try to kick u. not even if he has one leg raised to kick at u thats also a no no. there is no reason what so ever that u haft to sit down in the middle of the arena and wait for him to stop acting like a butt! thats just letting him get away with it! he shouldnt even have a temper tantrum! there is nuthing wrong with his health or tack, but there is something wrong with his atitude and the way he treats u! even if he is moody/cranky there isnt a reason for the way he acts! REMEBER U R THE BOSS!!!!!!!!!|`|S8Tzx44paa	Don't kick your horse too hard. Horses are like humans in that way. Think about it: if someone kicked you, wouldn't you kick them back out of pure reaction?|`|9a7178737d913282593305c060610232aa	I don't blame you for not wanting to sell him. I love your method of ignoring him XD ! My horse did the same thing and i used join-up. heres a link for step-by-step instructions on how to do it. P.S. Don't listen to the people criticizing you & your horse.I hate that,also. <br>  <br>  Go here to see how to use join-up.<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Join-Up-With-a-Horse" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Join-Up-With-a-Ho...</a> .<br>  <br>   It worked wonders for me & my horse. You can use it tomorrow on him if you want! Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  <br>  You can use Cayuse's advice,first,then try this if it doesn't work,or try this first,and if this isn't the solution to the horse,then use Cayuse's idea,because,to me,that's also a good idea. I'm 1/2 & 1/2 with using whips and stuff. I think maybe force is what's causing it & he's tired of it & trying to defend himself. But then the pressure & force get to be too much,asnd he gives in. Which is why I put the link for the join-up method,because it uses no force and we've used it for our problem horses & beginner horses at our training facility & horse farm. If you choose to use Cayuse's idea,please use join-up before & after using Cayuse's method to show your horse that you're not ALL force.However a horse DOES need to know that the rider is boss. But try listening to your horse & looking at his body language to figure out if there's a problem. Just know that  these methids will not cure your horse overnight,they will take practice,patience,and love. And as a final word:<br>  Love your horse for who he is!|`|vidhmLHjaa	Relax. It's a very normal thing for a horse to do when he's become sour to pressure. You've over-used pressure and he simply resents it. The way that he's telling you this is by kicking. <br>  Some horses will rear up, others will charge at the person, others will go into bucking fits and so on....<br>  <br>  Go back to some basics to get your position back as a leader.<br>  <br>  Start on the ground work because your issue has to do with his lack of going forward. When a horse refuses to go forward, he will kick, buck, rear up, etc.... <br>  <br>  Why does he refuse to go forward? Because you've "yelled" at him with too much pressure too quickly, and he's sick of it. <br>  <br>  1) think LIGHT. Start with some ground work like this:<br>  -on the lunge line, take the end of the line and point it to your left. <br>  -look at his left shoulder and ask it to move to your left to get him to where he's walking around you in a circle to your left<br>  -"kiss" or cluck at the shoulder and raise your whip and tap the air (1...2...3...4...) then tap his shoulder (1...2...3...4...) each number represents a tap of the whip....1 is light tap, 2 is a harder tap, 3 is a harder tap still, and 4 is a much louder tap...keep tapping him louder and louder (bouncing the whip off of the shoulder. use big arm movement, so it's not just a stinging whack)<br>  -the moment that he moves that shoulder to your left...stop all pressure (tapping and kiss/cluck is pressure)<br>  -repeat until he stays facing your left<br>  -then look at his left hip and tell it to move forward in the same way:<br>  -kiss/cluck, tap the air, tap the hip (high on the hip)....1..2..3...4... until he is walking around you without stopping<br>  -once he starts to walk, your feet will stay only in one small circle. your belly button will face his left shoulder as he walks around you. this is important. if he kicks out at you, you'll be safe facing his shoulder<br>  <br>  then ask him to stop by taking out the slack in the lead line (you are holding the lead in your left hand, use your right hand to pull the lead through your left, so you can take out the slack and make his left hip move away from you (his back feet will cross and he will end up stopped and facing you)<br>  <br>  look at his left shoulder and repeat it all over again...every single step<br>  <br>  What you are doing is resetting his Go Forward Cue. You've burning it out by using too much pressure (kicking a horse to go is not what you want to do, you should roll your hips forward and back then squeezing your calves against his sides then kiss/cluck then raise the crop then tap his hip 1..2..3..4.. do not whack!)<br>  <br>  back to the ground work: <br>  once you can point and kiss/cluck and he moves around you in a lunging circle to the left without you needing to raise the whip at all, then repeat the whole process for a trot, and last for a lope. <br>  <br>  Don't bother riding him until you can do all gaits on the ground! YOU need to train yourself to use pressure properly, so til you get the idea of rhythm not whacking him with a crop or kicking with your feet, stay on the ground....1...2....3....4.... use pressure like a volume knob always starting with LIGHT first. <br>  <br>  Give your horse the chance to think about what you're asking. He's as intelligent as a 5 year old human kid. So, imagine if you were to scream at a kid every time you wanted something, that kid wouldn't like to be around you much anymore, and that's what's happened with your horse. But you can change this. It's not hard. You can change it as long as you give your horse the chance to respond to LIGHT pressure first (kiss/cluck sound then the steps)<br>  <br>  If at any time your horse turns his butt toward you on the ground, IMMEDIATELY pull on the lead line to get his head to face you...this moves his hips and his feet away from you. Do this every single time. <br>  <br>  Then go back to the lesson. <br>  <br>  Your horse isn't being mean, he's just frustrated. So, if you go back to basics and let him relearn how to respect pressure, he'll do that and he'll decide to change his mood.<br>  <br>  ***ALSO if you are scared of him then find a trainer to help you out. It's not a big deal. The trainer can help your horse learn that pressure is not something to resent anymore and can give you lessons on how to keep this from happening again. ***|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Have you tried just squeezing him with your legs? I had a horse that would buck if you kicked him, but respond perfectly when you gave him a light squeeze.<br>  <br>  As for the lunging... that's SERIOUS disrespect. If he does that, crack the whip and keep him moving for a while.|`|KDyEWM9gaa	This is not cool...ur horse is bein ignorant and rude....he's probably testing ur patience my horse tests me nearly all the time...dont let him get away with it!.....try the whip...|`|BREi7qw7aa	your horse has NO respect for you, thats why. If your horse threatens to kick you while your lunging, then get him with the whip!! you need to show him that you are in charge!!|`|6iCOMx8laa	I agree 100% w/Cayuse. That is by far the best advice here|`|dBRxfRGqaa	please don't listen to the people saying that it is your horse's fault, cuz it's not. he's just being himself, which is probably unmotivated and bored of being taken out of the pasture/stall, brushed, saddled, lunged, riden, unsaddled, brushed, and put out again every time you get him out. this is what everybody does with horses, and some horses enjoy it, but others, like your horse, need something to motivate them. you need to become leader, but not in a forceful way. spend time with him. take him out and let him graze. PLAY with him, don't "work on him." be creative, unpredictable, do fun stuff. develop a relationship. most of all, don't ask for much from him. ask less and he'll give you more. find out what motivates your horse, and have fun with it. it's not about work. sometimes i think people want their horses to be perfect, because we take it personally when they arent. we just need to think about what our horses are thinking.|`|qw9ZjAlDaa	He's spoiled.  It's his way of saying "no, I don't wanna" when you tell him to do something.  And when you just sit in the middle of the arena and wait for him, he gets away with it.  You have to push him through it and make him do what you want to or else he win and becomes the dominant one in the relationship.  If you aren't comfortable pushing through this kind of behaviour, you need to find someone who is to help you, either a trainer, or just someone more experienced who is willing to lend a hand.  A kicking horse is dangerous and if you aren't comfortable dealing with it, find someone who is!
rQlzfHqraa	Day-old chicks should not have whole grains. Chicks will do best on a chick starter feed, water and grits. Ask at the feed store for their recommendation. Follow the instructions that the chicks come with. When they are older, about half feathered you can add many grains and seeds. My favorites are chicken scratch feed and wild bird seed mix to give them a variety and I give them free access to layer pellets as I always want the eggs. I f confined chickens need grits and for quality eggs shells give oyster shell.|`|R4IWxA0Xaa	they should be fed a food such as layena crumbles w/ medication
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Your female needs to be about 15 months and needs to be at a proper gram weight before doing so. Try to remember the stress you are going to put her under and hopefully you have more tanks and light setups all ready as well as an incubator and homes to feed all these new babies.

Unless you got your cat from a breeder odds are your cat ISN'T really Siamese it's just a cat with pointed markings.  And you're not going to find a "Siamese look alike possible full bred almost wild male cat"  Do you really think breeders just like pedigreed cats out the door unaltered to go knock up mutt cats?<br>  <br>  Since neither of these cats are pedigreed there's no way to know what these kittens will end up looking out.  Pointed markings do tend to darken as a cat gets older but a cat with tortie/calico markings that you're describing would have them from birth - they don't just show up weeks later.<br>  <br>  Get your damn cat spayed and stop adding to the pet overpopulation problem.  These kittens mean that many more kittens or cats will be PUT TO DEATH at your local shelters since they'll take homes away from the shelter cats.  Please DO NOT give these kittens away unaltered of you could end up being responsible for THOUSANDS more unwanted kittens as they go on to breed and their kittens and so on and so on.  If you "can't afford" or "don't want" to pay for the expense of altering them then surrender the litter to a no-kill shelter and they'll do it and find them appropriate homes.  Give them a donation as well to cover some of the expenses.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Pointed (Siamese) coloring is genetically recessive.  If both parents display pointed coloring you can't have non-pointed kittens.  It is possible more than one male cat sired your cats kittens.  If a non-pointed cat sired some of the kittens those kittens could be full color but they would display that coloring from birth it wouldn't develop over time like the pointed coloring does.|`|vyXvOaUvaa	Yes I have an unusual siamese-burmese hybrid that is called a tonkinese.  Her highlights are a faint champagne color. We got her when she was about 10 weeks old and all white. Then later the coloring became evident. It is still faint and she is about four years old now.|`|AJxl0IvHaa	yes.<br>  its possible.<br>  Did you know kittens in the mommys tummy can have two diffrent daddys?
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	80% crickets and super worms to 20% veggies and greens. After a year it goes the exact opposite. No meal worms for bearded dragons either due to the hard exoskeleton. It has been known to cause problems. Wax worms and butter worms only as a treat and never any insects from the yard.|`|NVgXA4hzaa	about 25% of its diet should be greens and 75% should be crickets,meal worms,grasshoppers and locusts.<br>  and a whole range of worms.
UlOKMInqaa	I own female rats but all of the things I've read say that male rats do tend to have a stronger odor due . I wouldn't be worried since this seems to be a natural thing. The only thing you can do is clean their cage more often if it bothers you that much. Also, you may think you should be bathing your rats to get rid of the smell, but doing that too often can really dry out their skin and strip their fur of its oil which isn't good.|`|IFGSOd16aa	Mine dont smell unless i stick my head in the cage. <br>  then its a little strong. lol <br>  <br>  so if your do the best advice i can give you is clean more.|`|b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	Male rats sometimes have a slight odor. The best thing to do to reduce the smell as much as you can is clean the cage out more often and clean the rats themselves. I personally have all females but when i rescued a pregnant one and she gave birth i noticed as the males matured they sort of did devolpe a smell. I think it's just how they are.|`|Zgtv1mDzaa	Yeah, the males smell a little stronger than the females do. if you cleaned out the sawdust more and even if you bought scented sawdust it works wonders =]
zRzKhgJkaa	In a book I read, it advised that you keep different hamster breeds apart. As the other girl before me said, she had a mouse and a robo living fone together. This doesn't mean that dwarfs and robos will get along though. Most hamster owners I've seen usually keep the same hamster breeds in the samge cage. But I'm not completely sure that they will fight though. I suggest that if you really want the robo hamster, try putting it together with the dwarf, and buy an extra cage just incase they don't get along, but if you do buy another cage buy another robo because robos seem to like to live in groups than alone, unlike the synarian.|`|6Rt9aM8daa	Different species of hamsters will never get along. Putting a dwarf with a robo will equal in fighting and even killing. Two chinese dwarf hamsters will equal the same thing. If you have your heart set on it, get a seperate cage. <br>  <br>  PS. <br>  If you do manage to get the Dwarf, and you still want both of your hamsters to be alive, then don't put them together.|`|J5FSz7fgaa	No. Mabey if they are from the same litter and the same kind,but no if they are not.|`|Hsmhwu2taa	You can try to put them in different cages or enclosures so they can sniff each other without having them so close they have the chance to fight for dominance. Try not to just put the dwarf right into the cage of your roborovski, or they might go into a life or death battle. Have them adjust, and they might get along. There are no guarantees they'll enjoy each others presence. Dwarfs are known to be much more sociable than syrians.|`|GMvzUYbSaa	Well, if they're the same sex, you could try. You never know until you experiment. I had a mouse and a robo live together and they would cuddle every night! Let them play together and if they fight, it's a no go. Otherwise, they'll be fine.|`|Rfj2ULibaa	I don't recommend it.  There is a very good chance they would fight, possibly to the death.
9fisqG1oaa	I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST TRY OUT A GERBILE AND USUALLY PEOPLE ONLY COMMENT ON THE WEB ABOUT STUFF IF  THERE IS A PROBLEM... THEY DONT FEEL THAT THERE IS A NEED TO SAY" THEY R WONDERFUL, U SHOULD TOTALLY GET ONE" ....|`|GMvzUYbSaa	Go for it! Just take good care of it. If it dies, it's not the end of the world and you learn from your mistakes. If you can, get two because they're social. But if you can only get one, make sure to play with it a lot! :D|`|BGuMKW3jaa	I'd say go for it if you've seen one you really want and you are all set to look after it ok :) It's a bit of a gamble with rodents. I have pet mice and I've had ones that have lived for 2 years and ones that have died after a few weeks...pets at home are a reputable place to buy from though. My friend got a hamster from there a few months ago and he's happy as Larry! :D xx
zRzKhgJkaa	I don't think your male hamster is aging though. I have a male synarian hamster and he is quite young. He is about 2 months old, and on closer inspection, I see small gray/silver hair strands in various places. This isn't because he is aging, though. I've read in a book called th Hamster Handbook that a couple of synarian's coat can have strands of gray/silver like my hamster. If yours is a different breed, I'm not sure the same rules of the coat pattern I just explained apply. I assure you though that your male hamster is not aging faster than his sister. Hamsters pretty much reach sexual maturity about 2 weeks old I think, and they live generally about 2 years. I personally never heard of male hamster dying earlier the females, because my friend has a male hamster and it lived for 3 years.|`|GMvzUYbSaa	Grey? They shouldn't be graying. Their hair gets a little lighter.. but that's it. But otherwise, it should be nothing.
8cikAYp3aa	look in your phone book, and find your local welding company.  They can fabricate a butt bar for you.  as for the rubber matting,  Its available from most feed stores, Farm stores or on line from Jeffers or KV,  another option is to see if you have a stone quarry anywhere near by.  they will often give away old conveyor belts.  Which make excellent trailer matts.<br>  <br>  For paneling,  I've always used 1 inch marine ply wood.  Its stands up to alot of abuse and works well for paneling'|`|AA11755182	LOL  I had the same problem!  My boy destroyed trailer door (3/4" wood with sheet metal on the outside) and a solid steel butt bar.  Even my trainer couldn't believe my boy could do that!  LOL<br>  <br>  We had to weld the butt bar back together.  You might find a local welding shop to either fix whats left of the old one or fabricate a new one.  Not sure about the rubber paneling, but you could have a spray on coating put on it.  It would be permanent then, so no worries about destruction from horsey teeth or hooves.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  It sounds like ou have some retraining work to do too!|`|PiI3RwYmaa	I don't really know but I thought I'd add that one of our mares busted through the door to the storage area in our 2 horse trailer AND managed to jump through the window in our 4 horse trailer..... im sure tsc or a shop like that would have some of  what you're looking for

fgxajTiBaa	Her body may have absorbed the litter. Which would explain why there is no milk production.<br>  <br>  Consider this good luck and get her in for a spay appointment. A month ago our shelter had 170 cats in our care (kittens too). Cats are the last thing this country needs more of.<br>  <br>  Add: Animals will absorb their litters when their body tells them they are not ready to have them, an environment is not suitable or the litter is unhealthy. If her teats had already shrunk I would say this is what happened. I'm glad that you volunteer at a shelter, maybe you can ask them about any low cost spay/neuter places in your area. What state are you located in? I could check to see if I could find one.<br>  You should strongly encourage your parents to spay her, maybe bring them into your shelter to show them how many homeless animals there are.|`|AJxl0IvHaa	Has she been outside?<br>  -Do you think she had them outside????<br>  <br>  - Look in hidden quiet places!!!|`|87756LlTaa	She has given birth.  However, they may have been stillborn, killed, or she abandoned them.  Sorry for the news.
Czh1fbQgaa	Mice are great little pets! I have owned 2. I currently have one. My mice cost $7 each at petsmart. Including the mice, cage, bedding, all that, I spent a little under $50. You could get it cheaper. <br>  Pine shavings are super cheap and are fine for your mice.<br>  I reccomend lab blocks for food<br>  Do NOT house them in glass aquariums.<br>  I have a superpet primary and its great<br>  The only problem with mice is that they do STINK! You have to clean the cage lots to keep it from being unbearable. My mouse really loves to ride around on my shoulder or on my lap. And loves to run around in his ball.<br>  I didn't spend any money on toys, I just give him toilet paper rolls and crinkled balls of white paper.<br>  <br>  Here are all the supplies you will need:<br>  -cage with wire sides<br>  -wheel<br>  -hiding house<br>  -chews<br>  -bedding (carefresh sucks, no cedar)<br>  -food dish<br>  -water bottle<br>  -run around ball|`|OrvTG44laa	Feeder mice make great pets, and are just as good as fancy mice.  They are only a few dollars.  Two mice will happily live in a 20 gallon long aquarium, which is about 40 dollars.  You can get a bigger cage with bars however for less money.  I suggest getting a barred cage.|`|8NvdgbDmaa	These are the prices in hawaii<br>  <br>  -Bedding:3.88<br>  -Food:5.00 for a 5LB(I have 2 mice 1 bag last 2 months)<br>  -Cage:25.00 and includes house,waterbottle,wheel that connects to cage)<br>  -Food dish:2.44 <br>  <br>  Mice are delightful little pets,undemanding,inexpensive,easy to care for.They can be kept in there cage full time as long as they have  room and toys.They are relaxing and can remain unattended over the weekend as long as they have extra food|`|enG4U5vAaa	They are quite cheap and easy to look after.

LplwlGzMaa	In my experience, sport horses, warmbloods and thoroughbreds are set up with square front feet and one back foot set back slightly.|`|A67q5Tapaa	so long as she is not  resting her foot  you are fine  let her keep that leg off set  she is not a QH..  and that should b fine<br>  good luck|`|Czh1fbQgaa	Horses naturally stand with one leg trailing. There is no training for that. You must teach your horse to stand with all 4 feet square.
4lB9aEH5aa	Leave her there.  Put some water  and food nearby.  Talk to her and tell her what you are doing.  Welcome her home. Tell her you are her person now. Tell her stories of how you plan to care for her. Use a calm upbeat voice. Stay calm whenever you approach the area.  Go about your business. Play music, make sounds.  She needs to get used to the new sounds and smells.  I wouldn't do laundry for a few days.  Scaring her will make the transition time longer. Be gentle and kind.  She will come out.  I once had a new-to-me cat stay under a dresser for 4 days.  Now we are best friends. Witnessing how animals overcome fear is a powerful learning experience.|`|6BBVOgmqaa	Put the litter, food and water near the washer not in the same place.<br>  <br>  If you can get her behind the neck like a mother carries a kitten she will just let you carry her.<br>  <br>  I would probably leave her there unless I could get her easily out of there.<br>  She is protecting herself and feeling safer.<br>  <br>  If she takes TOO many days get help and get her into the room.|`|TA0C2Mhuaa	I would recommend, putting food and water near the back of the washer, so she can see it, and if she doesn't come out for a while, or seems stuck; get her out. But if your washer gets hot behind there when you run it, you probably shouldn't run the washer until she leaves the area.|`|qGDnMZsdaa	Is there a way you could seal her in the room with the washer? I.e are there doors etc and nothign that will be a danger to wee kitten ? I would possibly move her water and food and litter into that room and then leave her for a while to come out at her own accord, which she should do if not stuck. <br>  <br>  When I got my kitten last yet, all her things were in the kitchen, and she spent the entire night we got her behind the washing machine, she came out eventually, Just ensure you are very quiet and gentle with her xx|`|VIlrDP45aa	try to lure her out with wet cat food or anything she likes and comfort her and give her a lot of attention to try to used to the new house!|`|1dQ48I7haa	bring her to the orginal room only because of the fact her food and water isnt near her|`|AJxl0IvHaa	If you have doors in the room with the washer shut them and just make that th room for her to stay in just for  a few days, or maybe just the night.<br>  She will come out when shes ready.<br>  I have almost the same problem with my foster preg. cat.<br>  She jumped out of my arms... and is under my bed .....<br>  Which is okay, she was going ot stay in my room anyway...<br>  - remember... cats are more stressed than dogs are.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	After a day, I would get her out of there and put her in the other room.  She should have come out by now from hunger and thirst.  At this point she is likely stuck.  A few days and she will be severely dehydrated and never mind the mess.
enG4U5vAaa	Hello. I am a vet and yes you can use cat shampoo for ferrets because of the ingredient (domitone). It is not poisness for any animal. Hope this helps.|`|Yr1nToGzaa	you can buy special ferret and rat shampoo. it's perfectly safe to use cat shampoo though! but its not necessary to wash ferrets anyway. i wash mine once every 1 or 2 months :) gentle baby shampoo or baby bath bubbles will work!|`|VIlrDP45aa	Any shampoo will work but to be safe use baby shampoo!|`|P27E6cwfaa	i love ferrets ;)|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	The best type of shampoo is soap-free with added omega acids in it.  But, cat shampoo is fine. <br>  <br>  Generally, if there's any kind of medicated substances being used (flea and tick killer, medicated shampoos, etc) always stay with 'cat' ones, too, as anything made for dogs can kill a ferret (just a tip for the future *g*).|`|AA10805458	If you can find a shampoo that is safe for young kittens it will be safe for ferrets.
qw9ZjAlDaa	Once leather starts to chaff there isn't much you can do to fix it but if you oil it, it will slow down the process.

It can be purchased at any tack store or farm and ranch stores like tractor supply and murdoch's|`|z3Z7AQWPaa	Oil darkens leather and waterproofs it some, so I wouldn't suggest that. <br>  <br>  Try some saddle soap and conditioner.

enG4U5vAaa	Hedgehogs are fascinating pets. Hedgehogs are illegal in some areas so check their status where you live before deciding on one as a pet. They are not the most active of pets but have a lot of character and are interesting little pets and quite easy to care for. <br>  <br>  They can live up to around 8 years which is great for a long term pet.<br>  They are pretty spiky but they can be held once they are tame. If they are not used to being handled they put their spines up and roll into a ball, and can be really prickly. However, when they are relaxed they lay their spines down pretty flat and then as long as you are careful, you can hold them quite easily. However, I donât know if I would call them cuddly, exactly, and mine always preferred running around and exploring to being held.<br>  <br>  They feed on insects, snails, frogs and toads, snakes, bird eggs, carrion, mushrooms, grass roots, berries, melons, and they especially love watermelons. <br>  Good luck x<br>  <br>  They dogs and cat should be fine by the way just be extra caredul though :-)|`|Yr1nToGzaa	you have to make sure they can't run away and have a hutch and a run for them unless they're living naturally. they are good pets and have really soft tummies! :) they do get a lot of flea problems though so be careful there. they can eat dog and cat food or you can buy special hedgehog food! :) as for the price ask around like at your local rescue centre. you shouldn't get bored with them they're amazing creatures to watch their antics the way they curl up into a ball and bounce around etc. :D it should get aong with a quiet dog and even if it doesn't hedgehogs curl up for protection so all the cats and dog will get is a very pricked face :P seeing as they live wild anyway getting them wet so be ok just don't drown them in water at any time! they are fairy clean and don't smell. for anything else get a book from a library or google it :)
