78b3d834e72deac7083fdd58233b5cbfaa	Well, the main difference is the age of the rocks.  Stable areas are known as cratons, and most craton rocks are over 2 billion years old.  They were active in early earth's history, but now they are solid and stable.  It is no coincidence that young areas that have been active recently are weaker, and thus, tend to be active again (like the Western US).  These places are typically on the margins of the cratons.  When the east coast of the US becomes active again, it will happen along the areas that started the Atlantic rifting, like Central Connecticut.|`|OgTvqmJ9aa	one is stable and one is active.

Expanding binomial square and subtracting like terms, we get,<br>  <br>  (-2hx + h + h^2)/h = -2x + 1 + h; the other one is done similarly.<br>  <br>  Just do each step and check often as you go along.  The common denominator when two expressions are relatively prime is, as with numbers, their product...for example, 1/3 + 1/8 = (SOMETHING)/24 because even though 8 is not prime, 3 and 8 are prime to each other.

17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	The best solar filters are the ones made by Kendrick using Baader AstroSolar film. This film is actually _less_ flimsy than glass, and has better optical qualities. They have the highest resolution and the most natural colour, and are well made of powder-coated aluminum with nylon thumb screws to hold them safely in place. I have three of Kendick's filters myself. You will need to measure the outer diameter of your telescope's tube to order the correct size.<br>  <br>  I own a PST myself, and since I got it four years ago, I've used my white-light filters exactly once! The Sun is just so much more interesting in H-alpha, especially when there's so little sunspot activity. Even if there are no sunspots, in H-alpha every day you can see prominences and flares.|`|MMUGLjsPaa	Use the link I provided below for selecting your solar filter.  Chances are no filter manufacturer  will state specifically that their filters fit a Celestron C10-NGT (you might find some who do) but they will give you the tube diameter that the filter fits. <br>  <br>  The PST costs a bit more than $250.  However if you have the money I'd get one and mount it to your SCT.  That way you use the tracking advantage of your SCT and demonstrate the difference between white light and H-alpha to passers-by.  <br>  <br>  One word of Caution though.  When viewing the sun.  The damage done to an eye by a missing or damage filter in instantaneous and permanent. Please observe the following safty precautions before viewing the sun.<br>  <br>  1) Check your filters before putting them on the scope.  You can do this with a white light filter by holding it at arm's length out to the sun and looking for holes<br>  2) MAKE SURE your spotter scope is not attached to your scope, or that it is covered with a working filter.<br>  3) Place your hand briefly over your eyepiece before putting your eye to your eyepiece.  It wont save you from UV damage but if the filter has failed or gotten knocked off byt the wind or a curious kid you'll know it!<br>  4) Another safety suggestion is to place a film canister over the eyepiece when not observing.  If it's damaged on your return it will be obvious.<br>  5) Never use an in-line solar filter unless it is front-ended by another filtering system.<br>  6) Never aim your scope at the sun with first having a safely working filtering system in place first.<br>  <br>  I know this sounds harsh but if you observe these rules you will have many happy hours safe solar observing a head of you.<br>  <br>  Good luck observing the sun.<br>  <br>  PS I know you don't want to make your own solar filter.  So I wont push you that way, however, I have made my own solar filters using the Badder Solar filtering mylar sheets and they work beautifully and lasted many years.

There is a huge genetic difference between them though. The Norway rat for instance, have 22 chromosomes, while the house mice have 20. This means they are different species that can not interbreed. There are many way scientists classify animals though: biological, morphological, ecological, and such. So its kind of a combination of all of that. (Like, if it looks even slightly different, lives in different areas, and is genetically different, then it has to be a different species from each other).<br>  <br>  Think of it like this:<br>  A horse and a donkey look similar.

CuMYdQV6aa	Depending on the species in question a number of adaptations are evident. Most alpines are ground hugging plants, their low stature giving them protection from bitter winds and allowing a blanket of snow to completely cover them. Most alpine plants have larger flowers than their lowland relatives (making them very popular with gardeners); these large flowers seem to be designed to attract bees in an environment where insect numbers can be low. Alpines often develop deeply penetrating root systems, partly to anchor themselves in situations where winds may be fierce and also to reach deep water reserves beneath screes or in other stony situations.
FUVakx3yaa	Yes, mitosis and meiosis I occur after S phase (DNA synthesis).  Note that between meiosis I and meiosis II there is no S phase and thus no DNA synthesis.<br>  <br>  Yes, at metaphase of mitosis and meiosis I and II, the chromosomes will all have two chromatids.  During mitosis and meiosis II is when the sister chromatids separate.<br>  <br>  The maternal and paternal alleles can have the same form of the gene (both be dominant or both be recessive) or code for different forms (one be dominant, the other recessive).  Note that the alleles will most likely not be identical because it is unlikely that the DNA sequences for each allele will be identical, but even though there are slight differences in DNA sequences, the alleles could still both be dominant or recessive.<br>  <br>  Yes, when the chromosome replicates and a sister chromatid is formed, then that sister chromatid is pretty close to identical to the original sister chromatid (there may be a few DNA sequence changes due to errors in DNA replication).<br>  <br>  Yes, your drawing is correct.

Most of these scientists will start a career in (marine) biology; others might become marine scientists starting as chemists or geologists.<br>  <br>  There is such a big range in salaries and amount of travel from person to person that it is hard to answer the other questions. Most marine scientists will work in academia, where salaries are OK, but usually not the main attraction. True scientists do the work they love, they usually do not choose their career for the money. A post doc will earn in the $ 30,000 to 40,000 range, a professor will be in the 100,000 range.

It focuses on how evolution has shaped the tree of life, and how whole groups of organisms are related (phylogenetic chart).<br>  <br>  The difference between the two are similar to the difference between a millimeter and a kilometer.  One measures great changes (Macroevolution), the other measures small changes (Microevolution).  If you add up a lot of small changes, you get a big change.|`|z7BiMSWmaa	Microevolution is an uncontroversial, well-documented, naturally-occurring, biological phenomenon. It happens every day. It is the process whereby preexisting genetic information is rearranged, corrupted, and/or lost through sexual reproduction and/or genetic mutation producing relatively small-scale (“micro”) changes within a population. Two long-haired dogs producing a short-haired puppy would be an example of microevolution.<br>  <br>  Macroevolution is the somewhat more controversial theoretical extrapolation of microevolution that requires the introduction of new genetic information. It is believed to produce large-scale (“macro”) changes. An amphibian evolving into a reptile or a reptile evolving into a bird would be examples of macroevolution|`|CCeRdaoLaa	Microevolution and macroevolution are the same thing - just plain old evolution.  The only difference is the scales that they operate on.<br>  <br>  Evolution is the change in the genes of a population over time.  This can be caused by existing genes being shuffled around (like the peppered moth example below), or by the introduction of new genes through mutations (like the E. coli example below).<br>  <br>  Take the peppered moth, for example.  They were usually a light gray color, but during the industrial revolution, the soot from nearby factories stained all the trees black.  As a result, the lighter moths were easier to see, and got eaten by birds.  The darker moths had a slightly higher chance of survival (and thereby passing on their darker genes).  After many generations, the moths had become nearly black, and could camouflage with the trees.<br>  <br>  That's a really simple version of evolution in a minor trait over a short period, so I suppose you could classify it as microevolution.  There are other documented examples, like a type of lizard that evolved to have longer legs once fire ants were introduced to its habitat (the longer legs allowed it to shake the ants off before being stung).<br>  <br>  Sometimes a new trait can be introduced through mutation.  Recently, bacteria (E. coli) in the lab was observed to evolve the ability to break down citrate.  It seems minor, but it's a huge deal to evolve an entirely new biochemical pathway.  Such a fundamental change in a relatively simple organism would probably fall under macroevolution.<br>  <br>  Macroevolution also happens when those minor changes pile up and lead to a larger change in a species.  Take the jump from dinosaurs to birds, for example.  First, scales adapted a new shape to provide better insulation.  Those proto-feathers allowed some smaller species to glide briefly, or at least survive a fall.  The feathers evolved to be larger over many generations, increasing gliding ability.  Limbs and bone structures evolved to maximize gliding potential.  Finally, the muscles and limbs developed to the point where active flight was possible.  Each one of these changes was small on its own, but put together, they were able to add up to a huge change.<br>  <br>  Like I said before, though, macroevolution and microevolution are the same thing, and there really isn't any distinction made between the two in science.|`|XRq9hBJlaa	macroevolution -  the evolution of a species into a new species, eg homo erectus into homo sapiens.... doesn't happen over night, but is the result of generations and generations of microevolution which are the small changes which give  the creature a survival/reproductive advantage over its peers

This means any change in water level can lead to a transgression or regression of mud over the bryozoan community.<br>  <br>  Ooids form in the wave zone, and changes in water level there are more likely to transgress or regress a coarser type of sediment (i.e. shoreface sands)

cNl17VNgaa	Your question is interesting. Do we need to rely on any government to give us "proof?"  Personally, I find most government "proof" suspect.  Maybe I'm just jaded.  However, looking at the vastness of the universe we just cannot assume we are the only intelligent, and I use that term loosely, beings in same universe.  <br>  <br>  Why couldn't there be more planets similar to earth, or that support life of some sort?  And why couldn't they have found a means to transport themselves the many light years to our planet?  My mind cannot comprehend what it would take to travel those distances but I'm sure there are minds out there that can.  <br>  <br>  Back to your question.  What would I do?   I would not trust the government to give me anything factual.  However, should I come across an alien in my day to day business I would do my best to communicate with them,  then  learn as much as possible about them, their planet, especially, how they got here.   <br>  <br>  Thought provoking question.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

So all of the dinosaurs lived and died millions of years before there were any humans.<br>  <br>  So it does not matter weather you believe the Noah flood story or not.  The dinosaurs could not have perished in the flood because they were already extinct millions of years before humans existed.

AGzuITcsaa	By substitution:<br>  <br>  -Set one equation to x or y (in this case x, its easier) to get x=-18+3y.  <br>  - We know that in both equations x is the same number, so substituting what we have x equal to will not alter it and gives us a solvable equation.  Go ahead and  substitute your x into the equation.<br>  - You now have 4(-18+3y)-2y=8<br>  - This comes out to a number that I really don't feel like solving now which is then plugged into one of your original 2 equations (remember that your answer is your y) to get the x and there you have it.  Plug them in to check<br>  <br>  Elimination:  <br>  <br>  - This method requires both variables be on one side of the equation, so you end up with 0=5q-3p and 2p-3q=1.<br>  - Remember that in all equations you can do whatever you want as long as you do the same to both sides.  By multiplying something with both sides of the equation you will get two terms that are opposites of each other.  In this case you would multiply one equation by 3 and the other by two and they are negatives of each other.<br>  - To understand how this works, remember that an equation states that both sides are of equal value.

1SJUXoraaa	becouse if there wernt it would fall|`|Qxx0svOVaa	If you are talking about weight, it is because there is a maximum amount that an elevator can hold.|`|Jk8iaoF0aa	An elevator works like this: Behind the shaft or somewhere in it, there is a big weight. When the lift is not moving, the weights are stabilized (brakes are engaged). But when you press the button, the built-in computer, depending on the floor you chose, "knows" how many seconds it has to move to reach that floor, so the brakes are released for this time. The weights have a certain mass (lets call it M), that is pulled by gravity (let's say that the gravity acceleration g=10 m/s^2) so <br>  doing B=m.g gives you the weights weight in Newtons (NOT mass, weight and mass are two different things, try not to confuse them). When the lift moves, let's say upwards, that's because the weights fall down, pulling the booth of the elevator up thanks to a pulley on the top. <br>  <br>  And now the true answer. If the mass inside the lift is less than the weights' mass, the lift will go up. If the masses are equal, it will become balanced. But if the mass inside the lift is bigger, then the elevator will go down, killing the unfortunate users! So, the weight limit you see is some Kgs less than the weights' mass.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

Yes animals may become cannibals but this is a short term solution and doesn't apply to all species.<br>  <br>  Other resources such as suitable places to nest or shelter may also be in short supply.

So each term of the problem series is lower-bounded by 1/n. If we can show that the harmonic series sum(1/n) diverges, then the comparison test shows that the problem series must also diverge. But it is well-known that the harmonic series diverges (at least I assume that has been taught to you in class), so we are done.

Nf60Q6UFaa	Over 300 exo-planets have been discovered so far, none as small as the Earth, yet.

The problem is one of distance and comparative brightness.  All the stars are something like our sun, so are naturally very bright.  Planets only reflect the light from their parent star.  Imagine a car headlight a half mile away, and next to it, a small piece of card.  Even with good binoculars, it would be very difficult to see that piece of card.  We are gradually finding more and more exo-planets, as we call them, but so far, they are all much larger than the Earth.  One day, we hope to have the technology to find smaller, truly Earth-like planets.|`|qXvFsnOcaa	Statistically, most stars will have planets and there will be a great many with Earth sized planets based on pure maths alone, but our technology isn't yet good enough to see things that small.|`|uxExLJUMaa	well how good can you see something that billions and trillions of miles away,even with the most advanced telescopes we have.|`|ZutXKkxPaa	yes most do we can't see them because they are very very very very very very very very very far away we can only see the stars because they are way bigger then our star if say the biggest star is the size of earth our star would be the size of a b.b. or maybe a marble.

G3LpGWXbaa	I disagree with whoever told you that.<br>  <br>  The voltage is directly proportional to the winding ratio. If the windings are 10:1 then the secondary will always be 1/10th of the primary. Each phase is independent in this respect. There is no reason divide the voltage by 1.73. The total power output however, would not be independent since we are using all three phases. With three phase, we can produce 1.73 times more power for the same amperage.<br>  <br>  If we have a single phase transformer with an output rating of 2W at 24KV:<br>  2W/24KV=83.3uA<br>   <br>  If we have a three phase transformer with an output rating of 2W at 24KV:<br>  2W/(24KV*1.73)=48.2uA
IjUqYbIxaa	I would have to say salt water is a mixture. You are essentially mixing salt with water. However, I do not believe all samples of salt water would taste EXACTLY the same. This has to do with the concentrations of the salt water samples. Salt can be dissolved in water at a certain volume of water. If the volume of water is not large enough, the sample is said to be saturated with salt because the ratio of salt to water is high. So in a sense, I feel a sample with very little salt and a lot of water would not taste as bitter as a sample that had a lot of salt and a small amount of water. In other words, larger concentrations of salt will taste very bitter and salty.|`|Ne9fbdLdaa	Mixture?<br>  I think cause the salt & Water are mixed(:|`|CDEpgqPkaa	mixture. not a compound because it is not chemically bound 2gether

AA11824362	As the rocks heat up they become less dense, and this causes them to rise. Colder rocks near the surface then sink. This is called convection. As the mantle convects the thin lithospheric (tectonic) plates, which are composed of the crust and the uppermost mantle, ride along with it.|`|0J2Tihe7aa	heat creates pressure and the pressure moves the plates
7HGPaUwIaa	Ridge Push is the force applied to plates at spreading centers. As plates separate, new, hotter material is extruded into the gap between plates. The elevated temperatures lower the density of the recently deposited material, causing it to float higher in the mantle; hence the formation of ridges. Gravity then takes over, drawing the ridge material down and away from the spreading center, thereby widening the gap for more hot mantle material to upwell. <br>  <br>  Slab Pull is considered by many to be the dominant, or even the only, driving mechanism for plate tectonics. Subduction zones typically occur a long distance away from spreading centers, where the plates have had plenty of time to cool off. Lower temperature makes the plate more dense than the material beneath it, causing it to subduct into the mantle. As the plate edge is drawn under, it pulls the remainder of the plate behind it. <br>  <br>  Plate Drag is supported in several different models of plate tectonics. In one model, the upper mantle is separated from the lower mantle, with little or no transfer of material between them. Small, local convection cells in the upper mantle can occur beneath the interiors of plates and can contribute frictional drag forces to reinforce plate movement. In another model, the upper and lower mantle are more tightly coupled, with material from plumes originating deep within the lower mantle and contributing significantly to upper mantle convection, and hence to plate movement.|`|dcd11iUwaa	Plates at our planet’s surface move because of the intense heat in the Earth’s core that causes molten rock in the mantle layer to move. It moves in a pattern called a convection cell that forms when warm material rises, cools, and eventually sink down. As the cooled material sinks down, it is warmed and rises again.<br>  <br>  Scientists once thought that Earth’s plates just surfed on top of the mantle’s giant convection cells, but now scientists believe that plates help themselves move instead of just surfing along. Just like convection cells, plates have warmer, thinner parts that are more likely to rise, and colder, denser parts that are more likely to sink.<br>  <br>  New parts of a plate rise because they are warm and the plate is thin. As hot magma rises to the surface at spreading ridges and forms new crust, the new crust pushes the rest of a plate out of its way. This is called ridge push.<br>  <br>  Old parts of a plate are likely to sink down into the mantle at subduction zones because they are colder and thicker than the warm mantle material underneath them. This is called slab pull.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	in general, it all works out for the better.|`|YX4y4vCfaa	Slab pull is an area of subduciton. The weight of an oceanic plate pulls it down under another oceanic or continental plate at an angle that gets steeper and steeper. I still think divergent boundaries and convection cells play a huge part in plate movement but you have to look at many factors.<br>  <br>  I have not heard the term ridge push but I'm guessing its a continent-continent convergent plate boundary. If so this is the "scrunching of continents creating mountian belts. The himalayans for example.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  OK, so ridge push is just another way of saying rift. A divergent boundary.|`|aLGe7JZEaa	The tectonic plates do not randomly drift or wander about the Earth's surface; they are driven by definite yet unseen forces. Although scientists can neither precisely describe nor fully understand the forces, most believe that the relatively shallow forces driving the lithospheric plates are coupled with forces originating much deeper in the Earth.<br>  <br>  What drives the plates?<br>  <br>  From seismic and other geophysical evidence and laboratory experiments, scientists generally agree with Harry Hess' theory that the plate-driving force is the slow movement of hot, softened mantle that lies below the rigid plates. This idea was first considered in the 1930s by Arthur Holmes, the English geologist who later influenced Harry Hess' thinking about seafloor spreading. Holmes speculated that the circular motion of the mantle carried the continents along in much the same way as a conveyor belt. However, at the time that Wegener proposed his theory of continental drift, most scientists still believed the Earth was a solid, motionless body. We now know better. As J. Tuzo Wilson eloquently stated in 1968, "The earth, instead of appearing as an inert statue, is a living, mobile thing." Both the Earth's surface and its interior are in motion. Below the lithospheric plates, at some depth the mantle is partially molten and can flow, albeit slowly, in response to steady forces applied for long periods of time. Just as a solid metal like steel, when exposed to heat and pressure, can be softened and take different shapes, so too can solid rock in the mantle when subjected to heat and pressure in the Earth's interior over millions of years. <br>  <br>  The mobile rock beneath the rigid plates is believed to be moving in a circular manner somewhat like a pot of thick soup when heated to boiling. The heated soup rises to the surface, spreads and begins to cool, and then sinks back to the bottom of the pot where it is reheated and rises again. This cycle is repeated over and over to generate what scientists call a convection cell or convective flow. While convective flow can be observed easily in a pot of boiling soup, the idea of such a process stirring up the Earth's interior is much more difficult to grasp. While we know that convective motion in the Earth is much, much slower than that of boiling soup, many unanswered questions remain: How many convection cells exist? Where and how do they originate? What is their structure?<br>  <br>  Convection cannot take place without a source of heat. Heat within the Earth comes from two main sources: radioactive decay and residual heat. Radioactive decay, a spontaneous process that is the basis of "isotopic clocks" used to date rocks, involves the loss of particles from the nucleus of an isotope (the parent) to form an isotope of a new element (the daughter). The radioactive decay of naturally occurring chemical elements -- most notably uranium, thorium, and potassium -- releases energy in the form of heat, which slowly migrates toward the Earth's surface. Residual heat is gravitational energy left over from the formation of the Earth -- 4.6 billion years ago -- by the "falling together" and compression of cosmic debris. How and why the escape of interior heat becomes concentrated in certain regions to form convection cells remains a mystery.<br>  <br>  Until the 1990s, prevailing explanations about what drives plate tectonics have emphasized mantle convection, and most earth scientists believed that seafloor spreading was the primary mechanism. Cold, denser material convects downward and hotter, lighter material rises because of gravity; this movement of material is an essential part of convection. In addition to the convective forces, some geologists argue that the intrusion of magma into the spreading ridge provides an additional force (called "ridge push") to propel and maintain plate movement. Thus, subduction processes are considered to be secondary, a logical but largely passive consequence of seafloor spreading. In recent years however, the tide has turned. Most scientists now favor the notion that forces associated with subduction are more important than seafloor spreading. Professor Seiya Uyeda (Tokai University, Japan), a world-renowned expert in plate tectonics, concluded in his keynote address at a major scientific conference on subduction processes in June 1994 that "subduction . . . plays a more fundamental role than seafloor spreading in shaping the earth's surface features" and "running the plate tectonic machinery." The gravity-controlled sinking of a cold, denser oceanic slab into the subduction zone (called "slab pull") -- dragging the rest of the plate along with it -- is now considered to be the driving force of plate tectonics.<br>  <br>  We know that forces at work deep within the Earth's interior drive plate motion, but we may never fully understand the details. At present, none of the proposed mechanisms can explain all the facets of plate movement; because these forces are buried so deeply, no mech|`|AA11002791	Go To:<br>  <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/unanswered.html" rel="nofollow">http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/unanswe...</a>|`|Xtyu4wphaa	what?|`|LNBClZOcaa	Just check on google

AA10335036	C. It's called magnetic or eddy-current damping, and the force is proportional to the speed of plate movement, the conductivity of the copper, the square of the magnetic field strength and the volume of copper in the field. Basically you can think of the copper plate as a series of short-circuited coils which generate circulating currents which in turn generate magnetic fields opposing the motion, not unlike a shorted generator. Since the current increases as the conductivity of the plate does, it's especially noticeable with thick plates of copper and aluminum. (You don't want magnetic materials like iron because the magnetic force will interfere with isolating and feeling the damping force.) When damping force is proportional to velocity it's often called viscous damping, which is just how it feels, like the plate is immersed in honey.

qaW3FQYoaa	It depends on exactly how the force is applied. The body will have some center of mass about which it will spin. If your applied impulse is exactly perpendicular to the vector from the COM to where you applied the impulse then all your energy is in the form of a torque and you only spin it. If the vectors are parallel then the torque is zero and only lateral motion results If the vectors are not perpendicular nor parallel then you will set up a spin and lateral motion.<br>  <br>  When you actually try and do this by dropping a rod as you suggest, what happens is that you probably aren't really applying the impulse perpendicular to the rod. The real world impulse takes some non-zero amount of time to act (I=Ft).<br>  As the rod begins to spin under the torque it moves away from the vertical axis and the force applied is no longer perpendicular (since your hammer is still traveling horizontally), so a lateral acceleration takes place.<br>  <br>  To keep the force perpendicular you would probably have to affix some sort of rocket-like device to the side of the rod. But then you also have to make sure that the consumed fuel doesn't change the COM.|`|4c2daec05f4f88483fd1490ee194945aaa	You could calculate its motion, but you would need to consider both linear and angular momentum.

Endosymbiosis is the idea that prokaryotes live inside and form a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationship with eukaryotes. Over time they became the organelles of eukaryote cells, mitochondria for example. Evidence for this theory is in the similarities between certain organelles and prokaryotes. The fact that many prokaryotes still have a life cycle which involves getting inside a eukaryotic cell.

What you mean to say is:<br>  <br>  Suppose lim f(x) = L, where L does not equal zero.<br>  and Suppose lim g(x) = 0.<br>  <br>  (To keep this readable I'm omitting all of the x-->c subscripts beneath the lim symbol, but you can put them back in when you write this out.)<br>  <br>  Prove that lim [f(x)/g(x)] does not exist.<br>  <br>  One way of proving this is to remember the theorem:<br>  If u(x) and v(x) are any two functions, and lim u(x) and lim v(x) both exist, then lim u(x)v(x) exists, and is equal to lim u(x) * lim v(x).<br>  <br>  Apply that here, in the case where u = g(x) and v = f(x)/g(x).  Note that uv = f(x).<br>  <br>  Suppose that lim f(x)/g(x) exists.  Then by the theorem above,<br>  L = lim f(x) = lim f(x)/g(x)  * lim g(x) = lim f(x)/g(x) * 0 = 0<br>  <br>  But L is not zero, by hypothesis.  So this is impossible.

Although there is no official distance related to that like lightyears, the distance from Earth to the sun, AUs, could be used to see how long it takes for light to reach other planets.<br>  <br>  However, as stated, the sun isnt exactly something you can just go through.  Think of it like an overcrowded school hallway.  You try to wring your way though, but you can not because people are in the way.  Eventually, you may need to take other paths to navigate around.  Imagine that hallway now took up 99% of the mass (and could fit about 10 jupiturs across it).  Think you could get through?  In reality, the light we see is from ages ago, perhaps when Homo Sapians and Homo Neanderthals were around.  <br>  <br>  If this is a school question though, as everyone else stated, the answer the teacher is looking for is probably 8 minutes.|`|AA12193600	The earth is 93,000,000 miles from earth (roughly) and the speed of light is 186,000 miles per second (roughly)--divide the first by the speed of light to give you the seconds it takes to reach earth.

oVz6sPsIaa	Bohr was the first person to realize that the sharp lines in the emission and absorption spectrum of hydrogen could be explained by assuming the electrons could only have angular momentum equal to an integral number of the value of Planck's constant.  It was the first application of the ideas of the quantum nature of the universe to atoms.  The Bohr model was replaced in the mid-1920s by the quantum theories of Schroedinger and Heisenberg.  However Niels Bohr was for many years the mentor of the new quantum mechanics.  Even the interpretation of quantum mechanics was referred to as the Copenhagen interpretation, named after the place where Bohr lived.  For years scientists trekked to Copenhagen to consult with Bohr about the newly developing ideas of the nature of the universe.

b1ceb7c8481526a9137bbf36ef3f74aaaa	The answer is 75.  A number's opposite is that number multiplied by -1.  So we're looking for x, where x = -x + 150, which described a number, x, being 150 greater than its opposite, -x.  This equation is solved as x = 75.
239bf03f74eeaad4c18a8972abf502cdaa	This is a separable differential equation. That means you separate all terms containing x on the one side and all y-terms on the other.

Suppose one circle A is larger than the other B so that B is contained in A. Now draw a circle C exactly middle-way between A and B so that the radius of C is the arithmetic mean of the radii of A and B. Clearly the ring formed by removing A from C has smaller area than that of the ring formed by removing C from B. So if we enlarge A to C and diminish B to C then clearly there is a net area decrease, while maintaining the radii sum. This shows that the sum of areas is never minimal as long as the radii of A and B differ. So the sum of areas is minimized by half the radii sum constant.

bqOvdGXxaa	Responder dmb06851 gave a valid answer but his answer would apply to low Voltage half wave rectifiers as well as high Voltage rectifiers.<br>  <br>   I think the disadvantages of using a half wave rectifier for generating DC high Voltage may be more noticeable and more costly to overcome, but the same disadvantages exist for a half wave DC low Voltage power supply as it does for a half wave DC high Voltage power Supply.<br>  <br>  The following disadvantage is a lot more bothersome and expensive to alleviate in a high Voltage half wave rectifier power supply than in a low Voltage half wave power supply. For a given effective DC output a half wave rectifier requires about twice the peak ac input Voltage as does the full wave rectifier. This means a greater number of winding in the secondary of the rectifier`s input transformer. This would also require higher voltage insulation in the secondary winding of the transformer. Of course this adds to the over all cost of the power supply. This increase in cost would probably be insignificant in a low Voltage half wave DC power supply compared to the increase in cost of a high Voltage half wave DC power supply.<br>  <br>  The effects of loading is a lot worse for a half wave power supply than for a full wave power supply. Of course this applies to low Voltage power supply as well as a high Voltage power supply.|`|AA11061397	The resultant ripple is at the supply frequency.<br>  <br>  If a full wave rectifier is used, the ripple is at twice the supply frequency and any given filtering will be twice as effective.
e59397a77e16f705abb35b86dee2e44eaa	Karl Frederich Gauss (d.1855) of Germany is noted as being highly acclaimed among the great scientists and mathematicians including Newton, Euler, Archimedes, Bernoulli. He is best known for his foundational theories on magnetism and electromagnetism. A unit of magnetic intensity bears his name. Gauss made notable contributions to planetary theory and general astronomy as well as to optics, and to the theories of numbers. He published on the theory of forces attracting according to the inverse square of the distance which is incorporated in both magnetism and gravitational theory.

Also, the first few planets we discover with native life forms on them will probably have life equivalent to our Precambrian type of life, very primitive and simple by our own standards. Furthermore, I suspect that life in the Universe may actually be more common on gas giant moons, or even in the atmospheres of gas giants themselves, than on rocky planets like the Earth, although the latter do seem more conducive to the development of advanced life forms and intelligence.|`|AA10880755	There is a slight possibility that we might find evidence of life, either current or past, within our solar system, but the probability is slim.<br>  <br>  As for life outside of our solar system, it is very unlikely that we will be able to find direct evidence of life due to the physical limitation imposed by the distance to even the nearest stars and planets.  However, we might find indirect evidence of life.<br>  <br>  What we know for fact today (through observational evidence) is:<br>  - There are many other planets in the Universe (outside of our Solar System) - "exoplanets"<br>  - Some of these planets are "rocky" like Earth<br>  - Some of these planets are at the right distance from the host stars to have the temperature range required to support life.<br>  - We have found evidence of water and organic compounds in exoplanets' atmospheres<br>  - We know that organic molecules that are building blocks of all living things are relatively common in the Universe (PAHs)<br>  - We know that if simple organic compounds are placed under right conditions of temperature, pressure, and energy input, they produce amino acids (building blocks of proteins) - Miller-Urey experiment<br>  - We have some plausible theories that explain how life could emerge from inanimate matter (RNA world hypothesis, abiogenesis, PAH world)<br>  <br>  These facts, plus the fact that there are billions of stars and planets in the Universe, tells us that statistically there is a substantial probability that life should have developed somewhere else beyond Earth.<br>  <br>  The next step toward confirming that life exists elsewhere in the Universe is to find evidence of molecular oxygen in the atmosphere of an exoplanet.  Molecular oxygen is relativaly rare in the Universe, and its abundance in Earth's atmosphere is due to the presence of photosynthetic organisms.  Without life that continuously replenishes oxygen in the atmosphere, oxygen would soon be consumed to form mineral oxides.  Hence, if we detect molecular oxygen in substantial amounts in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, the most plausible explenation is that it is produced by living organisms throught the process of photosynthesis.  Of course, there could also be other forms of life that do not use photosynthesis.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	Life? Yes.  <br>  <br>  Little Green Men?

K6QlFoo0aa	The important relationships are these:<br>  <br>  To change from a percent to decimal, divide the percent by 100 and drop the % sign.<br>  <br>  (Example 1)  So 68% = 68/100 = .68 or 0.68 if you like the leading 0.<br>  <br>  (Example 1a)  Also notice that on the way I converted the percentage to a fraction 68/100.  This is not in simplified form so divide numerator and denominator by 2, getting 34/50.  The numerator and denominator are still even so divide them by 2 again, getting 17/25.  That's as far as you can simplify it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Going back from decimal to percent simply multiply the decimal by 100 (this is the reverse of dividing by 100) and add the percentage sign back on.<br>  <br>  (Example 2)  2.37 is the decimal.  2.37 * 100 = 237%<br>  <br>  So now you can go from percent to fraction (Example 1a)).  <br>  <br>  You can also go from percent to decimal (example 1)<br>  <br>  You can also go from decimal to percent (example 2)<br>  <br>  Now for the most difficult one - decimal to fraction.  It's not that difficult.<br>  <br>  Multiply the decimal times 100 and turn it into a fraction by dividing by 100.<br>  <br>  (Example 3)  2.3 =  ((2.3 * 100) / 100) = 230 / 100.  <br>  <br>  Divide numerator and denominator by 10 to simplify.  You get 23/100<br>  <br>  Sometimes though it looks nasty.<br>  <br>  (Example 4)  What about this decimal: 2345.6.  You still multiply and divide by 100, getting:<br>  <br>  234560/100........Divide numerator and denominator by 10, getting<br>  <br>  23456 / 10<br>  <br>  They are both even so simplify by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2.<br>  <br>  11728/5  That's called a compound fraction (and you better believe that I used my calculator :D ).  Your teacher may not like that, so take out your calculator or long divide 11728 by 5, getting 2345.6.  Oops, another decimal.<br>  <br>  That's okay 2345.6 = 2345 + 0.6.  What to do about the .6  I would divide it by 10 and multiply it by 10, but I don't want you to get confused so do what I told you to do before.  Multiply and divide it by 100, then simplify.<br>  <br>  (.6 * 100) / 100 = 60 /100.  Divide numerator and denominator by 10, getting 6/10.  They are both even so divide numerator and denominator by 2, getting 3/5.<br>  <br>  So looking back up to where we had 2345.6 we now have 2345 3/5.<br>  <br>  Now for the real ugly 0.0000234<br>  <br>  Multiply and divide it by 100 (after a while you'll know to do it in one step with 10,000,000) but baby steps first.<br>  <br>  0.00234 / 100.  Do it again.<br>  <br>  0.234 / (100*100) = 0.234 / 10,000.  Again 23.4 / 1,000,000 Not enough.  Again 2340 / 100,000,000 Oops too far.  Divide numerator and denominator by 10, getting:<br>  <br>   234/10,000,000.  They are both even so divide numerator and denominator by 2.<br>  <br>  117 / 5,000,000  Done at last.<br>  <br>  I hope you understood all of this.  It should be done over a week of class with you doing problems and giving me feedback verbally but this is Yahoo Answers.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!

oqUCqiFeaa	Onions produce the chemical irritant known as syn-propanethial-S-oxide. It stimulates the eyes' lachrymal glands so they release tears. Scientists used to blame the enzyme allinase for the instability of substances in a cut onion. Recent studies from Japan, however, proved that lachrymatory-factor synthase, (a previously undiscovered enzyme) is the culprit (Imani et al, 2002).<br>  <br>  The process goes as follows:<br>  <br>     1. Lachrymatory-factor synthase is released into the air when we cut an onion.<br>     2. The synthase enzyme converts the sulfoxides (amino acids) of the onion into sulfenic acid.<br>     3. The unstable sulfenic acid rearranges itself into syn-ropanethial-S-oxide.<br>     4. Syn-propanethial-S-oxide gets into the air and comes in contact with our eyes. The lachrymal glands become irritated and produces the tears!|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	When you slice through an onion, you break open a number of onion cells. Some of these cells have enzymes inside of them, and when they are sliced open, the enzymes escape. The enzymes then decompose some of the other substances that have escaped from sliced cells. Some of these substances, amino acid sulfoxides, form sulfenic acids, which then quickly rearrange themselves into a volatile gas. <br>  The gas reaches your eyes and reacts with the water that keeps them moist. This changes the chemical's form again, producing, among other things, a mild sulfuric acid, which irritates the eyes. The nerve endings in your eyes are very sensitive and so they pick up on this irritation (this is why our eyes sting when we slice onions). The brain reacts by telling your tear ducts to produce more water, to dilute the irritating acid so the eyes are protected. Your other reaction is probably to rub your eyes, but this will actually make the irritation a lot worse, of course, if you have onion juices all over your hands. <br>  Oddly enough, this volatile compound is also responsible for a lot of the great taste in onions, as well as the pleasant aroma when you cook the vegetable. You'll also get sulfenic acids by cutting up garlic, chives and leeks, among other vegetables, but they don't form the same irritating gas, just a strong smell. <br>  There are all kinds of remedies for dealing with this irritating phenomenon, some more effective than others. As a general rule, move your head as far away from the onion as you can, so the gas will mostly disperse before it reaches your eyes. If you really can't stand the tears, the simplest solution might be to wear goggles. This measure is very effective, but it may seem a bit extreme to those around you, and if your kitchen is steamy, you might not be able to see what you're doing (never a good idea when you're using a knife). <br>  Peeling the onion and then chilling it in the refrigerator before you slice it will minimize the release of gas somewhat, because the change in temperature alters the compounds in the onion. Cooking an onion before you slice it will work also, for the same reason. Another easy solution is to cut the onion under water or run the tap over it as you slice. <br>  Some people say if you hold a lemon, piece of bread or a sugar cube in your mouth, the food will absorb the gas before it reaches your eyes. Breathing with your mouth, instead of your nose, might also help because as you inhale, you suck the gas in and as you exhale, you blow it away. This keeps a lot of the gas from ever reaching your eyes.|`|tk4PLUvnaa	It's not a chemical. it's the combination of all the chemicals which make the onion smell so bitter that you cry.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	Amino acid sulfoxides form sulfenic acids.

You have to do this constantly (e.g. by pumping in air which goes through some base like lime). <br>  Let plants grow in one setup where you bubble incoming air through water (doesn't remove Co2) and one where you bubble through base.<br>  Make sure illumination and temp are the same.<br>  Measure wet weight, dry weight and amount of carbon after a minimum of 3d. Use something like bean seedling, so they grow fast. Put maybe 6 seedlings into your chamber, so you see if all individual plants are the same and you have some replicates.|`|5rP0zBudaa	You would need to remove the carbon dioxide from the plant and see if it still grows. <br>  <br>  I would put the plant in a large plastic bag and push all of the air out of it. Then blow air through a tube that passes through a beaker or bottle of lime water (calcium hydroxide) which will absorb the carbon dioxide and then go through another tube to fill up the bag.  (i hope you get it i would draw a picture if i could)<br>  <br>  Then see if the plant grows better than an identical plant which is left in a bag which is filled with normal air.

Donating blood today has two personal benefits for men.  It eliminates excess iron (which the body recycles) which can lead to heart problems.  Menstruating women lose excess iron.  The red blood cells that are donated are quickly replaced.  Because a red blood cell has a life of about 120 days before it becomes hard and carries less oxygen it is eliminated.  Donating blood reduces the average age of the red blood cells.  These effects may have benefited patients in older times although doctors likely had no idea of the cause and effect.  Also bleeding could be easily overdone.  I heard stories (on TV?) that George Washington might have survived his final illness if doctors had bled him less.  Bleeding may have been associated with the four humors (worth checking).

Sah5tjD8aa	There are a number of alternative treatments that work for migraine that do not involve medication.  Talk to your OB about the options.  While occassional use of medications is not high risk, the less medication you take during pregnancy, the better.  I have had a number of migraine patients who have controlled their migraines by taking supplemental oxygen, and this will not have any negative effect on your baby.

5H7Wgaknaa	The next lunar eclipse visible from New York will be the total eclipse on 21st December 2010. There are between 2 and 5 lunar eclipses in a year and all it takes to see one is that the Moon should be above the horizon at the time when it's nearly exactly opposite to the Sun (this doesn't always happen at a typical full moon). So there should be more than a 50-50 chance of seeing any lunar eclipse from a given place. New York is slightly out of luck because there are four lunar eclipses before December 2010 and they are either not visible in New York or they are small penumbral eclipses, when the Moon skirts the outer edge of the Earth's shadow and little or no shading is visible.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	Lunar eclipses happen about every 7 months on average, but you have to be on the correct side of the earth during the few hours it happens.  To see totality, there has to be fairly close alignment.  It lasts only a couple hours.<br>  It would happen every month, but the moon's orbit is tilted about 9 degrees from the plane of the ecliptic (projection of earth's orbit onto the sky).  That is enough to make an eclipse come not very often.  Sometimes lunar and solar eclipses come in pairs about two weeks apart.|`|nKCMRLysaa	This is a good website: <a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html" rel="nofollow">http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.htm...</a><br>  <br>  If you ever get a chance to see a total solar eclipse, don't miss it. It's an amazing experience. Watching a video doesn't give you any idea what it's actually like when you see it "for real".<br>  <br>  A lunar eclipse lasts much longer than a solar eclipse, and the moon never actually disappears, but it goes a dark red or copper color because of the light diffusing through the earth's atmosphere.

In order to be a star, an object must be massive enough to sustain fusion in its core. Jupiter would need to be about 80 times more massive than it is in order for it to fuse hydrogen in its core.<br>  <br>  That said, the energy of such a collision would be so enormous that the two merging planets may outshine the Sun in the sky. That much more light reaching the Earth could bake us all in our own atmosphere. Furthermore, even if it didn't, the collision would no doubt send chunks of material flying throughout the Solar System, and the Earth would undergo at least several million years of relatively intense impacting, which itself might be sufficient to destroy human civilization.|`|Nnm17zqxaa	It would make a collisoal exploasion, so big that our neighboring galaxy would see it.

If t tends to negative infinity, then the function approaches 0. Intuitively, we say that the limit of a function at a point is L (that is as x-->c, f(x)-->L) if the function "settles down" to L the closer x becomes to c. That is, if you are very close to c on the x axis, then the function should be very close to L on the y axis.

As far as we know, photons do not have mass, but they do have momentum as well as energy and are a wavicle like everything else.<br>  <br>  As far as the above goes, electrons do not have a finite size as far as we can tell, so they are "size-less particles," but electrons certainly have mass.  If you really want to think about these things, Wheeler's delayed choice experiment, quantum erasure, and for that matter, the classic Stern-Gerlach experiment should keep you occupied for a while.<br>  <br>  In response to below, we very much mean that photons are massless particles, it is not an approximation.|`|O7rMKLEMaa	I assume you are referring to neutrinos, which were thought to be totally massless. Now, it is believe that they do have a mass, but not enough to measure. Also, photons have a dual personality; they behave like both particles and waves. <br>  <br>  Yes; a massless particle is pure energy. <br>  <br>  In my Fractal Foam Model of Universes, massive particles consist of ethereal sheer waves orbiting one another. A sheer wave is pure energy, but when a pair of sheer waves orbit one another, some or all of that energy becomes mass. In orbit, the sheer waves move around their common center at the speed of light, so the common center must move slower than light. In the case of neutrinos, the orbital speed relative to the common center is less than the speed of light, so the common center moves very close to the speed of light. Therefore, only a fraction of the energy of the sheer waves in a neutrino is mass.|`|RXvZvnJHaa	Of course, it can't.<br>  They just say "massless" to mean "mass is very small -- ignore it".<br>  This is usually done to make a physics problem solvable by simple means.|`|XxBQ1x7zaa	Mass-less means that it takes up so little space that you can just say that it takes up none.

m2zXOREJaa	The theory of relativity is one big bang.|`|a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	It's actually two theories.  One of them is 'Special Relativity' and the other is called 'General Relativity'.<br>  <br>  SR is a theory used to explain anomalies when making measurements in different inertial reference frames.  It was first developed by A. Einstein based upon the work of Michelson and Morley who attempted to measure the speed of what was called the 'ether'.  The 'ether' was, supposedly, the 'fluid' thru which electromagnetic waves moved (much as an ocean wave moves thru water).  Their discovery that the speed of light was a constant, no matter in which direction they, themselves, were moving, led Einstein to theorize that the speed of light would be a constant in 'any' inertial reference.  Working from that one premise he then showed how 'space' and 'time' were really just two different forms of the same thing and predicted the space and time dilations that so many people find impossible to accept.  He also showed how the same could be said of 'mass' and 'energy' and that they were also just different forms of the same thing.  The real proof of the mass-energy equivalence was the detonation of the first Atomic Bomb at White Sands, New Mexico.<br>  <br>  General relativity involves the interaction of 'mass' (or gravity) with the actual 'geometry' of space and time.  It is a geometric description of gravity and, among other things, it predicts the existence of 'Black Holes'.<br>  <br>  Getting much deeper than that would take all day.  But there are any number of good websites that will introduce you to the basics.<br>  <br>  Doug|`|74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	There are two...the general TOR specifies that gravity curves space and the special TOR specifies that time, mass, and length are relative to rest time, mass, and length.  Both were offered by Al Einstein in the early 1900s.  Both have been experimentally validated.<br>  <br>  E = mc^2 is one of the most commonly known outcomes of relativity.  E is energy, m is mass, and c is light speed in a vacuum.  This is the source of energy for atomic bombs and nuclear power plants.<br>  <br>  Some of the other interesting outcomes is that c, light speed, is the same no matter where and when the observer measures it.  So even if you were watching a car at near light speed come at you with its headlights on, the light from those lights would still strike you at c, the speed of light.<br>  <br>  Another one is that time slows down on board a vessel traveling near light speed and relative to some observer on Earth.  In which case, occupants of the vessel could go out for a year according to their own clock and land back on Earth to find it was hundreds or thousands of years into their future.|`|Jn7bt3JTaa	E=mc2<br>  <br>  See link for the rest of the Article<br>  <br>  In November of 1919, at the age of 40, Albert Einstein became an overnight celebrity, thanks to a solar eclipse. An experiment had confirmed that light rays from distant stars were deflected by the gravity of the sun in just the amount he had predicted in his theory of gravity, general relativity. General relativity was the first major new theory of gravity since Isaac Newton's more than 250 years earlier.<br>  <br>  Einstein became a hero, and the myth-building began. Headlines appeared in newspapers all over the world. On November 8, 1919, for example, the London Times had an article headlined: "The Revolution In Science/Einstein Versus Newton." Two days later, The New York Times' headlines read: "Lights All Askew In The Heavens/Men Of Science More Or Less Agog Over Results Of Eclipse Observations/Einstein Theory Triumphs." The planet was exhausted from World War I, eager for some sign of humankind's nobility, and suddenly here was a modest scientific genius, seemingly interested only in pure intellectual pursuits.

Many people used these places as homes knowing how large they were they knew they could reside there and go virtually undetected. Teens would use these places as a party, rave or truancy center. They would go there and party. Same with vandals they think it is awesome to go into these places and tag or even set fires just for the thrill. They would often build fires for warmth and for fun considering many of the older asylums often closed fully stocked with beds and such,Most even closed leaving the medical records in the file cabinets.

The Javan, Bali and Caspian tigers are extinct subspecies.<br>  <br>  The name 'sabre-toothed tiger' is something of a misnomer - these animals were only distantly related to tigers, being in a different subfamily to any living cats. Sabre-toothed cats is a more accurate name - the best-known are those of the genus Smilodon.<br>  <br>  The Tasmanian tiger is one of the common names for Thylacinus cynocephalus - others include the thylacine and Tasmanian wolf. This animal was a marsupial - its closest living relative is the Tasmanian devil, and it is unrelated to either tigers or wolves, both of which are placental mammals.

NbdTgyLPaa	This problem really needs you to either visualize it properly or to make a drawing.  I have made a drawing for you that I uploaded (it's in my sources below).<br>  <br>  If the problem is worded like you have written and given to you without any drawing, then you need to make two assumptions.  One assumption is in what direction the tree is from the east gate, and the other assumption is what direction the man travels in after leaving the south gate.<br>  <br>  The most logical assumption for the placement of the tree, is that it is 15 paces from the east gate, on an imaginary line that runs directly from the center of the city to the east gate.  You could experiment with other positions, and you could solve for them as well, but unless you're in some advanced math class and they want you to write an equation that solves for all possible positions of the tree, this doesn't seem like what the problem is asking about.<br>  <br>  Similarly, the most logical assumption for the path the man to travel in is in a straight line that is a continuation of an imaginary line that runs through the center of the city and the south gate.  One of the reasons for this assumption is in your statement about "similar triangles."  If the man walks in that direction, we will have three similar triangles, and the problem becomes simple ratios.<br>  <br>  My drawing makes these assumptions, and in it you will notice I have labeled a few points.  C is the center of the city, T is the location of the tree, and W is where the man has walked to.<br>  <br>  Of the three triangles in the picture, the one we have the most information about is the triangle with vertices at the east gate, the tree, and the southeast corner of the city.  In particular, we can see that the ratio of the wall and the distance to the city is 100 paces to 15 paces, or 100/15.  (Note that 100 paces is half the length of the full wall, and the wall is 200 paces long.)<br>  <br>  Now the similar triangle that has the piece of information we want to find is the one with vertices at the south gate, the southeast corner of the wall, and the point that the man walked to.  If X is that unknown distance traveled, then that distance to the wall from the south gate to the southeast corner of the city is the same as the ratio in our first triangle.  Or X/100 = 100/15.<br>  <br>  Now multiply both sides by 100, gives you X = 10000/15 = 2000/3.  Or a little under 667 paces (666.6666... with the 6 repeating).<br>  <br>  Edit:  After I posted my solution, I noticed the first solution, and realized that perhaps what I thought was the most logical direction to travel in was not the only reasonable possibility based on the somewhat vague way the problem was worded.  The other solution is based on assuming that the man travels in whatever direction produces the shortest distance he has to travel in order to see the tree.  Since that also seems reasonable to me, and since the first solution didn't show how to solve for this, I decided to include that as well.<br>  <br>  For this, please see the second image I made, listed in my sources.  In it I labeled some additional points as well.  E is a point representing the east gate, S is a point that represents the south gate, M is a point at which the man has traveled the minimum distance to see the tree, and Z is a point representing the southeast corner of the city wall.<br>  <br>  Notice that TZM is on a straight line.  This means that the angles TZE + EZS + SZM = 180 degrees.  But we know EZS is 90 degrees, so angles TZE + SZM = 90 degrees, meaning they are complementary.  As the triangle TEZ is a right triangle, this means that the angles TZE and ZTE are also complementary.  Putting those two facts together means that angle TZE = ZSM.  And since both triangles TEZ and ZMS are right triangles, we now know that the triangles are similar.<br>  <br>  Next we calculate the length of TZ by the Pythagorean Theorem.  TZ * TZ = 15*15 + 100*100 = 10225.  So TZ = sqrt(10225).<br>  <br>  Using the fact the triangles are similar, our unknown distance is SM, and SM is to SZ as EZ is to TZ.  Or<br>  SM/SZ = EZ/TZ<br>  SM/100 = 100/sqrt(10225)<br>  SM = 10000/sqrt<br>  Or the man would walk approximately 98.89 paces to see the tree.|`|PYaRd9kwaa	I drew a picture of the situation.  I'm assuming that the tree is 15 paces to the east of the east gate.  If you are saying that the person has to take the shortest walk outside the south gate, then the distance that they would have to travel is 98.89 paces.<br>  <br>  This is because the triangles formed outside of each gate are similar.  I checked the answer using inverse sine and cosine and it works.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Hint: look for supplementary angles.

79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	>How dose a Black Hole Work?<br>  <br>  What do you mean, 'how does it work'? What specific aspect of its function are you asking about?<br>  <br>  >How dose it form<br>  <br>  A black hole forms after a sufficiently massive star dies. Stars keep themselves puffed out by balancing the gravity that pulls them inwards and the internal pressure (generated from hydrogen fusion) that pushes them outwards. However, after a while a star runs out of hydrogen to fuse, and so its gravity pulls it inwards and causes it to become smaller and more dense. Once a massive star gets dense enough, helium begins to fuse in the center, causing a chain reaction and an enormous explosion known as a supernova, one of the most high-energy events in the Universe. Most of the star is blown away into space in a cloud of gas, but the dense core remains behind. If that core is sufficiently massive, then the gravitational force pulling it inwards can overcome even the force that pushes neutrons out, and after that there is nothing to stop the star's core becoming more and more dense and gaining higher and higher gravity. The gravity is soon so high that within a certain region around the object, the escape velocity is higher than the speed of light, and so nothing that falls in past that region (known as the 'event horizon') can get back out.<br>  <br>  >how dose the gravity get so strong<br>  <br>  The gravity is very strong in a black hole because the black hole itself is very massive (generally somewhat more massive than the Sun) and very dense. The more massive and the more dense an object is, the higher gravity it has.<br>  <br>  >is it a ball or a suction tube<br>  <br>  More like a ball. However, the actual material that makes up a black hole is hidden deep inside the event horizon, so we wouldn't really see it like a ball. Some black holes are in areas with a lot of gas and dust, and as that gas and dust falls into the black hole, it is heated by the pressure and emits a lot of radiation before passing the event horizon, so black holes of this sort would appear extremely bright to a nearby observer. That said, a black hole which is NOT in a region of dense gas would look like a circular area of distortion in the background image (due to light curving as it passes around the black hole) around a central black circle. You can see a reasonably accurate computer-generated rendition of a black hole here:<br>  <a href="http://www.thespacewriter.com/Black_Hole_Milkyway.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacewriter.com/Black_Hole...</a><br>  <br>  >what is it<br>  <br>  As mentioned above, black holes are areas of space that contain enough matter packed into a small enough volume that their escape velocity is higher than the speed of light.<br>  <br>  >have scientists ever gotton a pic of it?<br>  <br>  There are no black holes close enough for us to easily see the distortion of light as it appears in the above rendition. If there were, it would be bad news for us as we would probably die soon afterwards! That said, telescopes have taken pictures of radiation coming from what are probably black holes as they compress and consume gas. Gamma ray bursts, arguably the most powerful localized events in the Universe, may be caused by black holes merging with either neutron stars or other black holes, and a fair number of gamma ray bursts have been recorded by instruments.|`|FhWOpW4waa	A black hole occurs when a massive star, much much larger than our sun, burns out its supply of fusible fuel.  Once fusion begisn to stop, the there is nothing left to conuteract the gravity of the star.  It thus collapses, untill it reaches a singularity, an infinitely small point with all the mass of the original star.<br>  <br>  At this point, the gravitational pull near the event horizon of the singularity is so great nothing can escape.  Picture it like a whirlpool in a sink or tub.<br>  <br>  We cannot directly observe a black hole, as no radiation escapes its pull for us to see.  However, many, if not all, blackholes spin, and such blackholes can emit x and gamma rays from their poles.<br>  <br>  Try here for better info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole</a>|`|qwvijKexaa	large star is destroyed, it turns into the black thing, and sucks up all the matter around it|`|VS0PuI5paa	If a massive object, such as a star, is squeezed into a small enough volume, its escape velocity will exceed the speed of light.

AA11146651	Ok, it's all pretty much like the "$50 coat is on sale for $35".  <br>  <br>  If the regular price of the coat is $50 and now it is on sale for $35, then it will cost you $15 less, like this:<br>  $50 - $35 = $15  <br>  <br>  You could also say the coat was discounted by $15, or the coat was reduced by $15, or you'll save $15 if you buy that coat ($50 - $15 = 35).<br>  <br>  You could also put it in terms of percentages.  If the discount is $15, you can figure that $15 is what percent of the regular price, like this:<br>  $15 = X% of $50<br>  $15 = X% x $50 (divide both sides by 50 to isolate X)<br>  15/50 = X%<br>  .30 = X% (multiply by 100 to convert to a non-decimal)<br>  30% = X<br>  <br>  So, you can say all of the following and they all mean the same thing:<br>  1.  the $50 coat is on sale for $35<br>  2.  the $50 coat is discounted by $15<br>  3.  the $50 coat is reduced by $15<br>  4.  you'll save $15 if you buy this coat<br>  5.  the $50 coat is on sale for 30% off<br>  6.  the $50 coat is discounted by 30%<br>  7.  you'll save 30% if you buy this coat<br>  8.  30% savings!<br>  9.  Save 30%!<br>  <br>  So, how does that apply to the $18,000 a year?  Ok, if Shelby earns $18,000 this year and then earns $19,500 next year, then she gets an additional $1,500 ($19,500 - $18,000 = $1,500).  In the coat problem, everything was discounted, on sale, going down.  In this problem, everything is going up, increasing.<br>  <br>  You know the dollar increase is $1,500.  To figure the percent increase, you need to figure out that $1,500 is what % of $18,000.  Remember, it's not the $19,500 that was increased; it was an increase on the $18,000:<br>  $1,500 = X% of $18,000<br>  1,500/18,000 = X%<br>  .083333 = X%<br>  8.3333% = X<br>  <br>  One more:  If Shelby get a 10% increase in her salary at the end of one year, that's the same as saying that Shelby gets her salary plus she gets 10% more, like this:<br>  <br>  $18,000 + (10% of $18,000) =<br>  $18,000 +  $1,800 =<br>  $19,800 end of first year<br>  <br>  For the second year, her salary begins at $19,800 and increases 10%, like this:<br>  $19,800 + (10% x $19,800) =<br>  $19,800 + $1,980 =<br>  $21,780 end of second year<br>  <br>  You can do it from here.
PsCCd63yaa	Ordinary induction problems have two parts to them:<br>  <br>  A "base case".  Usually it's n = 1, but in this case it's n = 3.  You're proving that the statement is true for n = 1.<br>  <br>  An "inductive step".  You show that if the statement is true for a n=k, then it's also true for n = k+1.<br>  <br>  Think of it as a bunch of dominos.  How do can you prove that every domino in a chain falls?  Well you need to prove two things:<br>  <br>  The first domino falls.<br>  If domino number n falls, then domino n+1 falls.<br>  <br>  <br>  Expand this second statement using specific values of n.  If domino 1 falls, then domino 2 falls.  Well, domino 1 falls from our 'base case', so we know domino 2 falls.  Now go to n = 2.  If domino 2 falls, then domino 3 falls.  So you'll see that it works for ALL integers n>1.  <br>  <br>  Notice that induction is STRICTLY for integers.  You can't prove a continuous statement using induction - it says nothing about n = 1.4 or n = pi.  <br>  <br>  Also, you can use induction to prove statements for other sets of integers, as long as they're in an arithmetic sequence.  If you want to prove a statement for the set of non-negative integers {0,1,2,3,4,5...}, use base case of 0 and inductive step of k proving k+1.  If you want to prove it for even positive integers {2,4,6,8...}, use base case of 2 and inductive step of k proving k+2.<br>  <br>  So, now to your problem.  For n = 3, 2^n is 9, and 2*3+ 1 is 7.  So you can prove that the statement is true for n = 3.<br>  <br>  Now, assume that it's true for n = k, and show that it's true for n = k+1 .<br>  <br>  2^k > 2k + 1 is given, and we want to show 2^(k+1) > 2(k+1) + 1.<br>  <br>  Start with what we're given:<br>  2^k > 2k + 1<br>  <br>  Multiply by 2 to make the left side look like what we want:<br>  2^k * 2 > 2(2k + 1)<br>  <br>  2^ (k+1) > 4k + 2<br>  <br>  We have 4k + 2 on the right.  We want 2k + 3.  Note that if k>3, 4k > 12, and 4k + 2 > 14.  And if k>3, 2k + 3 > 9.  It's pretty easy to see then that 4k + 2 > 2k + 3 for all k > 3.  So....<br>  <br>  2^(k+1) > 4k + 2 > 2k + 3 (or 2(k+1) + 1)<br>  <br>  Remember - you actually haven't proven this statement for n >=3.  You've proven it for INTEGERS n >=3.|`|NOAeDaALaa	the answer is n is (3, infinity) n can be any number from 3 to infinity because 2 to the 3rd power is 8 and 2(3)+1= 7... if you try any number greater than 3, you will find the same thing happening... <br>  <br>  For example:<br>  2 to the 4th power is 16. 2(4)+1= 9<br>  2 to the 5th power is 32. 2(5)+1=11<br>  <br>  This is because squaring, cubing, (taking a number to any power) multiplies it by so much.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped

To write this in numbers do it like this.               12 / 1  =    120 / ?<br>  <br>  to solve this cross multiply  (120 *1 = 120)  then divide by 12 = 10 feet|`|J8uhpecYaa	12 inches equals one foot.

To get an intuitive idea as to why this is the case, think of how exponents are defined when they are positive integers.  If y is a positive integer and x is some real number, then x^y (x to the power of y) is defined to be:<br>  <br>  x*x*x*...*x, where x appears in that product exactly y times.<br>  <br>  If y is equal to 1, then by that definition, raising x to the power of y would only give you one appearance of x with no other x's to multiply it to.  So, x^1 = x.<br>  <br>  Also, after you've extended the definition of exponents from integers to all real numbers, it's actually impossible to raise a nonzero number x to any finite power y and get zero as an answer.|`|gxlhJzZAaa	1 to the first is one 2 to the first is 2, any number to the first power stays the same.

Everything else is bull.<br>  <br>  Nostradamus didn't predict anything for 2012.<br>  <br>  Some people think the Mayans did, but they are wrong. The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar. It does NOT predict the end of the world. It just so happens that the Mayan version of "December 31, 1999" falls on what we would call "December 21, 2012." The Mayan calendar contains events that happen AFTER 2012, even after 4000 AD, so clearly the world will not "end" at this point.<br>  <br>  (You'll remember that a lot of fools also thought the world was going to end in 12-31-1999, but it didn't. Same deal.)<br>  <br>  The hoaxters mainly choose 12212012 because of numerology (which is also garbage) and the repeating and reversal of "12", and also because December 21 being the winter solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern hemisphere, it was considered the "End" of the year by MANY ancient civilizations. And that's ALL.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

8QjEISWeaa	Lucy, the problem is that you are confusing the theory of biological evolution with the one of abiogenesis. The organic life coming from inorganic materials is abiogenesis not evolution. Evolution is descent with modification, that all living beings had evolve from a common ancestor and that is a fact. The evidence is simply incredible. Why would you share 98% of your genetic material with chimps? Come on, explain me. Genes do not lie my darling. You have 3 options, to ignore the evidence, to accept it, or to try to disprove it. If you are going to ignore the evidence and keep saying the evolution is not a fact, sorry my dear, but that's mental illness, if you do not accept evolution, go and disprove all the evidence that real scientist had gather in the last 150 years.

QPWjtDzcaa	They probably want you to do the math, and calculate the velocity given the distance of the moon and the time it took to get there, and apply that velocity to the distance of Pluto.  This is an exercise in futility, because space travel doesn't work that way.  We would not send a craft in a straight line to Pluto, but more likely a transfer orbit, most likely a Hohmann transfer orbit.  And the velocity of the craft (if planned properly) would change by using gravity assists of some of the gas giants on the way.  <br>  <br>  Read up on the New Horizons probe, it will get to Pluto at a pace much greater than one that covers an earth-moon distance in 2 and a half days.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the answer your book, or teacher, or whoever, wants you to come up with is...<br>  <br>  velocity =  roughly 6,667kph<br>  about 102.6 years<br>  37,474 days|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	Using your distances and assuming the same travel speed, it would take 37,500 days or 102.7 years.|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	This is not simple division e.g 1.5 X10^4.

AA11824362	Petroleum (crude oil) is a mixture of alkanes, parafins, olefins, aromatics, and other organic chemicals. Depending on various factors there can be a substantial amounts of thiols (sulfur-bearing molecules). There is no one % of the various fractions in a barrel of crude, as this changes from location to location, and can even change within a given producing field. There are general terms used to describe some basic compositions of a barrel of crude. The terms "light" and "heavy" denote the relative amounts of smaller to larger hydrocarbon chains. If total sulfur content is low the term "sweet" is applied, as opposed to "sour" when it is high. Intermediate is used for crude falling in between sweet and sour.

Also the Sun is in fact a variable star, and is actual 25% hotter now than what it was when the earth first formed; the sun is getting hotter.

It is telling you that this CN tower is 233.33 M TALLER than the Eiffel Tower -  So if the CN tower is Taller than the Eiffel Tower than you would use subtraction - the amt it is taller - more - than the ET.

k5Ece8BTaa	A black hole is a place where so much matter exists that gravity has caused Space to fold in on itself creating a barrier surrounding it called an event horizon. Once something has passed to the inside of the event horizon it cannot escape. Not even light can escape the gravitational pull thus it is called a black hole. Everything that enters a black hole falls to its center where massive amounts of matter (many times that of our sun) are compressed into an infinitely small, infinitely dense core called the singularity. It is hard to explain beyond this what go's on inside of a black hole because physics does not yet have a complete enough theory which can describe the state of affairs in this radically different environment.<br>  <br>  The only black holes that we know for certain to exist are those formed by the collapse of very massive stars at the end of their life. These black holes are massive themselves, several times the mass of the Sun.<br>  <br>  However, mini black holes might be formed as well in the collision of high energy particles. These are known to happen in the upper atmosphere where cosmic rays from space collide with the atoms in air.<br>  <br>  This mini black holes are short lived. After a millionth of a second they evaporate into photons.<br>  <br>  The black hole in the center of our universe it Sagittarius A and we aren't get pulled into it because we are too far away.

NcroVJO6aa	The amplitude of the function is 8.5. This means that the the blade will go up 8.5 meters from the center when sin is 1. The odd thing here though is that when the blade angle is 90 degrees, you would expect the end of the blade will be at the highest, but sin(90+180) = -1. This indicates that the point is on some bottom section of the blade. <br>  30 is an upward shift of the graph, so the point is never below 30-8.5, or 21.5 meters, and it never goes above 30+8.5, or 38.5 meters.<br>  <br>  When θ =0, the point is at 30 meters. Then the point will go in a circle which means that it will rhythmically go up and then down just like the sine function.

2lQ8DJAcaa	There are two general types of trees, angiosperms and gymnosperms. Angiosperms are flowering plants in which the ovule, or seed, is encased in a protective ovary. With about 235,000 species, the angiosperm division is the largest and most diverse plant group. It is divided into dicots, plants with two cotyledons (seed leaf structures), that include the familiar broadleaf trees such as maple and oak; and the monocots, plants with one cotyledon that include the palms and lily trees.|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	dicot|`|y6hhAKDNaa	Pine trees are gymnosperms and have varying numbers of cotyledons that can range anywhere from 2-24 depending on species, so they are classified as multicotyledonous. <br>  <br>  maybe this is the same as oak tree.|`|9q70kt7vaa	oak

Just keep in mind that the intent of the problem is to avoid using π.<br>  <br>  This is teaching the concept that if you double the radius of the cylinder then the volume will be four times as big exactly.

oaeD5B1taa	Because in trigonometry, the hypotenuse is thought of as a radius or radial vector----it can point in any direction; but in setting up the six fundamental ratios (sine, cosine, tangent, etc) we use the right triangle, and while the hypotenuse can aim in any direction throughout the  full 360, the other two shorter sides can only point in one of two directions----this means the vertical or ordinate can either point up or down (plus or minus) while the horizontal leg (abscissa) can only go left or right (again, plus or minus).....when you begin studying complex numbers this will become very clear and you will fully understand why they adopted his convention and way of doing it.|`|UF48eJkhaa	The reason we denote the coordinates of triangles as having negative or positive positions is in relation to the four quadrants that compose a cartesian plane.<br>  <br>  Length can never be a negative number in reality. Often negative lengths are used as means of denoting a direction, as in use with the unit circle lengths are expressed negatively as to regard what part of the circle it is refering to.<br>  <br>  In any triangle by itself there will be no negatives, as said previously, length can never be negative.|`|1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	Actually, you can make sense out of geometry with lengths that are negative or even have complex values.  Everything that is true in conventional Euclidean geometry would also be true in a geometry where lengths, areas, and volumes can have those values, even though it can lead to some pretty bizarre results.  But you would never reach a numerical contradiction, since what's true algebraically for reals is also true algebraically for complex quantities as well, such as the Pythagorean relation a2 + b2 = c2.  It's not true that hypotenuses "have to be" positive--that only defines Euclidean geometry, but other kinds of valid, self-consistent geometries are possible.

X8LNbaKQaa	Constants are numerical values.  For instance the constant that relates the circumference of any circle to its diameter is pi which has a value of approximately 3.14159.  You multiply any circles diameter by that constant to find the circumference.<br>  <br>  A variable is a name that represents a numerical value that can change in different situations.  For instance, you might use the variable name, C to represent the circumference of any particular circle.  You could also use the name, D to represent the diameter if any particular circle.  Using these two variables and the constant, pi, you can put their relationship in a general circle formula:<br>  <br>  pi * D = C<br>  <br>  Pick any value for D that you like (the diameter of any particular circle) and the formula shows how to find the other variable, C (the circumference of that same circle), using the constant, pi as a multiplier.<br>  <br>  Of course, that same formula can be rearranged, so you can start with a value for the variable, C and solve for the corresponding value of the variable, D.<br>  <br>  C / pi = D<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish|`|LlXH8yGcaa	Constants are factors which will (or at least assumed to) stay constant, unchanging.  Variables are factors which may change.  <br>  For example:<br>  That the Irish sneak into our houses to steal babies is a constant, it has always happened, and always will, and they all do it.  How many babies they will steal on any night, how they will go about doing it, and how much whiskey they will then feed to said babies are all variables.|`|3X7hF6ssaa	depends on what for. like science, the constant could be temperature and the variables could be pressure and volume.

Before we can substitute du, we need to multiply the coefficient 2 inside the integral to satisfy the equation du = 2 * dx. In order to account for this insertion, we need to nullify it by putting (1/2) outside the integral. This way 2 * (1/2) = 1:<br>  (1/2) | sec(2x) * tan(2x) * 2 * dx<br>  <br>  3. Which after substituting leads to:<br>  (1/2) | sec(u) * tan(u) * du<br>  <br>  [You can ignore 3.5 if you understand 3]<br>  <br>  3.5 Another way to think of this would be to isolate dx and substituting that into the integral. When dx is isolated, we get the equation:<br>  dx = du / 2<br>  <br>  Now substituting in this case gives:<br>   | sec(u) * tan(u) * du / 2<br>  <br>  We can pull out (1/2) inside this new integral which gives:<br>  (1/2) | sec(u) * tan(u) * du [the same integral in step 3]<br>  <br>  4. Since we have u with du and no x's, we're now ready to take the anti-derivative:<br>  (1/2) sec(u) + C , C = Constant<br>  <br>  5. Since u = 2x, we can substitute u for 2x:<br>  (1/2) sec(2x) + C<br>  <br>  6. Simplifying gives:<br>  sec(2x) / 2 + C

The natural explanation for what you are seeing comes from an understanding of how the light receptor cells in your eye work. There are two general kinds, "rods" and "cones".  Rods are concentrated in your peripheral vision (i.e., the corner of your eye) and are great for detecting changes in light level or motion, but very bad for detecting color or sensing shapes. Meanwhile, cones are concentrated in your forward vision which are great for detecting color and shape, but which are less sensitive than the rods (for example, if you are stargazing and can barely see a certain star, focus your vision slightly away from the star and it will seem brighter). So your peripheral sensing can get triggered by the slightest transient change in your environment, giving the impression that there is some dark blob lurking in your peripheral vision. But when you turn to look there is nothing to see. The act of turning the head can also give rise to the illusion that the dark blob is moving quickly. <br>  <br>  So, no, there does not seem to be any paranormal stuff going on.

How many grams of NaCl are needed to form 2 liters of 0.1M solution?<br>  Answer: <a href="http://chemistry.boisestate.edu/people/richardbanks/inorganic/stoichiometry/stoichiometry.htm" rel="nofollow">http://chemistry.boisestate.edu/people/r...</a><br>  <br>  Q2.Describe a colloid and state the difference between it and suspension. Give one example of a colloid.<br>  Answer: Solutions are homogeneous mixtures with particle sizes at the molecule or ion level. The particles have dimensions between 0.1 to 2 nanometers. Typically solutions are transparent. Light can usually pass through the solution. If the solute is able to absorb visible light then the solution will have a color. A blue liquid transmits blue light and absorbs the other colors of the spectrum.<br>  <br>  Example of solutions<br>  <br>  gas in gas<br>  air ( N2, O2 , Ar, CO2 , other gases)<br>  gas in liquid<br>  soda pop (CO2 in water)<br>  liquid in liquid<br>  gasoline (a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds)<br>  solid in liquid<br>  sea water ( NaCl and other salts in water)<br>  gas in solid<br>  H2 in platinum or palladium<br>  liquid in solid<br>  dental amalgams ( mercury in silver)<br>  solid in solid<br>  alloys ( brass, (Cu/Zn), solder (Sn/Pb)<br>  <br>  Suspensions are homogeneous mixtures with particles that have diameters greater than 1000 nm, 0.000001 meter. The size of the particles is great enough so they are visible to the naked eye. Suspensions are "murky" or "opaque". They do not transmit light. Suspensions separate on standing. The mixture of particles can be separated by filtration. Blood and aerosol sprays are examples of suspensions.<br>  <br>  example of a colloid.<br>  Many household products are colloids inclueding butter, bread and milk.<br>  <br>  <br>  Q3.Describe how a reverse osmosis unit works in purifying water.<br>  Answer: Reverse osmosis water purification system having a permeate diaphragm pump.<br>  <br>  A permeate pump located between a reverse osmosis water filter and an accumulator of a reverse osmosis water purification system. The permeate pump increases the pressure of the permeate water delivered to the accumulator. The permeate pump is driven by the pressure of the concentrate water that is introduced into the reverse osmosis filter. <br>  <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/rowpu.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/s...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Q4. What is the function of a semi-permeable membrane in osmosis?<br>  Answer: Osmosis is the natural process in which water moves across a semi-permeable membrane from an area of higher water concentration (low solute concentration) to an area of lower water concentration (high solute concentration).<br>  <br>  Therefore, osmosis usually occurs within living creatures and the membrane involved is made from their natural tissues.<br>  <br>  Reverse osmosis, however, is a man-made process which is essentially the reverse of osmosis - using a semi-permeable membrane, but applying pressure in the area of lower water concentration so as the natural osmotic pressure is overcome and flow is towards the area of higher water concentration.<br>  <br>  These membranes are synthetically produced and are not exactly the same as natural membranes, even though they function similarly.<br>  <br>  Secondly, these synthetic membranes SHOULD be reusable.  Their lifespan and durability is probably best found out from the vendor.<br>  <br>  Also, just for your further information in case you didn't already know:  Reverse osmosis is only one step in the desalination process that makes water potable.  Other steps are necessary for pre-treatment, disinfection, and pH "stabilization."<br>  <br>  <br>  Q5.

Between the closed end and the mark for 34cm, draw a complete wavelength, with a node at the closed end, a node halfway at 17cm, and a node at 34cm.  Continue the wave to the open end of the pipe, where the amplitude is a maximum.  There you have it, 3 nodes!

mH1Tnv5Naa	Monsoons are simply seasonal shifts in the prevailing winds which can result in either enhanced precipitation or reduced precipitation, amongst other things. They occur as seasonal air pressure between two areas shift.<br>  <br>  Thunderstorms and hurricanes form due to nature transferring excessive heat energy from the surface into the atmosphere in an attempt to restore energy balance.  Thunderstorms do this on a relatively local scale while hurricanes do this on a much larger scale.  Tornadoes are usually a result of strong wind shear (winds changing in speed and direction as altitude increases) which can cause the lower atmosphere to develop areas of horizontal rolling (vorticity) which if a storm passes over, can tilt this rolling vertically and in some cases cause a shrinking of this rotation which increases its speed.

This allows for the ones who benefit to be the ones who will more than likely be the ones who survive and produce the next generation.<br>  With asexual reproduction their is no genetic diversity, offspring are essentially clones of their parents.

This means that the species has a greater variation of features, one of which may be needed for adaptation in the future. If the species is a sexually reproducing one, there is a greater chance of this gene or feature being spread to other offspring, where as asexual individuals can only give their offspring their genes, not another parents' as well. Therefore the sexually reproducing species has a greater chance of adaptation, and because of that, survival.    :)|`|IEb4gtdpaa	there's more variation in animals that reproduce sexually. when they reproduce, the more dominant traits (ones that help them survive) are usually given to the child. in sexual reproduction, more "mutations" occur, and most of the time, these "mutations" help animals survive|`|fWI8QxB7aa	offspring not nearly as dependent on the enviroment as asexually reproducing organisms.|`|S8AKs5s6aa	offspring faster? o.0|`|rMCxx2NXaa	idk|`|4y4BXElwaa	I do not know the exact answer but if the species produce asexually the offspring are only getting one parents DNA and if they produce sexually the offspring get two different types of DNA given to them by the parent so they have more genetics, and they probably would be able to fight off disease easier....but im unsure....been awhile since I went to school|`|a010b3fdc9589a66c7d2baaf49c3a540aa	...offspring quicker.|`|TpJDtpDsaa	BABY BOOMS!!!!

lNyZ4ZN2aa	The solar atmospheric magnetic field is generated below the solar surface between the convection zone and the radiative zone.  When the twisted magnetic flux tubes rise towards the solar surface, a significant amount of magnetic energy is transferred from the interior to the atmosphere.  That magnetic energy is the main source for the energy in active regions, where much of solar activity is associated.  It intensifies greatly when the emerging flux interacts with pre-existing magnetic system.

They are intensely social animals. They live in family groups called packs, which usually have less than 10 members, though up to 30 have been recorded. The pack is led by a dominant pair called the alpha male and female - they mate for life and are the pack's only breeding pair. The rest of the pack is made up of their siblings and/or offspring. Below the alpha pair is a second-in-command called a beta wolf. Then come mid-ranked individuals, and at the bottom of the heap is the omega wolf, the lowest-ranked pack member. All members of the pack help to hunt, defend the territory and raise the alpha pair's young. The strict heirarchy of the pack is maintained through displays of dominance and submission, which eliminate the need for physical violence. A dominant wolf will stand tall with its head up, ears pricked and tail raised. A submissive wolf will crouch low, with head down, ears flattened and tail tucked between the hind legs. It may even roll over on its back as a gesture of complete submission. Members of the pack are very affectionate towards each other, often licking and nuzzling, and play together every day. They are extremely loyal to one another, and will feed, protect and take care of sick or injured pack members. Maintaining the bonds between them is essential for their survival, and they have been observed to mourn when a member of the pack dies - they cease play for around 6 weeks, and howl often as though calling to the missing member. There are even cases known in which, when one of a mated pair dies, the other will stop eating until it too dies.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	Kangaroo or opossum....<br>  those marsupials that carry their babies everywhere are supermoms!|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Penguins|`|MNuS31nsaa	dog or car|`|PJZRGsc3aa	dog

KAPKfyugaa	If you draw your triangle, you will have A at the top, with B lower and to the right and the flare (which I'll call C) at the bottom.  From the information given, we can tell that:<br>  (1) the line from A to C is at an angle of 5° to the vertical<br>  (2) the line from B to C is at an angle of 13° to the vertical, and<br>  (3) the line from B to A is at an angle of 45° to the vertical<br>  <br>  Using this, you need to find the missing angles of the triangle.<br>  <br>  First, notice that angle B is supplementary to two angles (13° and 45°), so B = 180° - 13° - 45° = 122°<br>  <br>  Next look at A. If you draw a horizontal line from A and connect it with a vertical one from B, you have a right triangle. Since the angle between B and the vertical line is 45°, then the other angle must also be 45°. So, A is complementary to angles of 45° and 5° and thus A = 90° - 45° - 5° = 40°<br>  <br>  To find angle C, use the sum of the angles in a triangle property to get that C = 180° - 40° - 122° = 18°<br>  <br>  Now you have one side and all of the angles in the triangle. You can use the sine law to solve for the other two sides.<br>  <br>  AC/sin122° = 50/sin18°<br>  AC = 50sin122°/sin18°<br>  AC ~ 137.2 km<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  BC/sin40° = 50/sin18°<br>  BC = 50sin40°/sin18°<br>  BC ~ 104 km<br>  <br>  So, Albacore is 137.2 km away from the flare and Bonito is 104 km away from the flare|`|pUZGKZ4Xaa	i think the albacore is 137.2 km away and the bonito is 104 km away

nZg5khNaaa	The inheritance is sex-linked recessive. All the sons have it and none of the daughters do, so that's a dead give away that it's sex-linked and recessive. Both of the woman's X chromosomes have the colorblindness trait. The husband has normal vision, so you know for sure the X chromosome is normal. When they have babies, every single male is going to be colorblind because the X always comes from the woman for baby boys. Every single female will not be colorblind, but will be a carrier, because they will receive the father's dominant trait and the mother's recessive trait for colorblindness.

A Forensic Scientist will then receive the evidence. If there are DNA or Bullets they will probably be sent of to another Forensic Scientist that specialized in that field. So, a Forensic Serologist would look at bodily fluids and a someone with relevant training in Ballistics would look at the bullets. So, although you could specialize in each field (and when I say specialize I mea a PhD in Forensic Science with Toxicology or Serology etc) you couldn't work as a SOCO and a Forensic Scientist all at once.

AA12139405	No.We are flying at the height of about 30,000 feet only.The atmosphere is also rotating with earth.|`|y6hhAKDNaa	Answer <br>  All air travel takes the earth's rotation into account. Flights from east to west take less time in an absolute terms, having nothing to do with time zones. The reverse is true with west to east flights, and even north-south flights must calculate the amount of rotational deviance while the aircraft is in flight. Long range naval cannons have been computing the earth's rotation under the projectile in aiming calculations for more than a century. Satellites in synchronous orbit that appear stationary are actually traveling at the earth's rate of rotation. <br>  <br>  <br>  Opinion <br>  Earth and its gravitational force is 25,000 Km radius. So not only earth is rotating but also the atmosphere of the earth is also rotating with the earth at the same speed. So there is no difference in travel time from east to west or west to east or in any direction of the earth as we are all inside the earth region including me, you and even our aircraft.
PV0pH7Pwaa	Intensive workouts result in microtrauma of the muscle fibers and the connective tissue resulting in inflammation leading to muscle soreness.  The microtrauma that results is due to microtears in the tissue.  <br>  Many people think that the soreness you feel the next day is due to lactic acid buildup.  I have even heard it lectured recently in a PhD level class, but this is incorrect and out of date data.  Lactic acid buildup occurs during the workout which will cause the burning sensation you feel in the muscle during the workout and shortly thereafter.  When your done exercising, and lactic acid is no longer being produced, it is flushed from your muscles in an hour or less.  The next day you wake up feeling sore due to the inflammation induced by the microtrauma of the muscle fibers and connective tissue (not due to lactic acid as it has already been cleared).<br>  <br>  Treatment for delayed onset muscle soreness usually involves a warm bath, massage, or gentle stretching or exercise.  This will increase blood flow to the sore muscles which promotes healing of the fibers.  This has nothing to do with flushing out lactic acid as it is already gone.|`|DN7DT7NFaa	lactic acid buildup causes muscle soreness|`|VVH1KWaaaa	The soreness is lactic acid in your muscles.

The 3 gallon bucket already had 1 gallon in it from the last step and could only hold 2 more gallons. So 7-2=5. Now the 3 gallon bucket is full with 3 gallons.<br>  <br>  9. Pour all 3 gallons from the 3 gallon bucket into the 10 gallon bucket which already has 2 gallons. This makes 5 gallons in the 10 gallon bucket. Now there is nothing in the 3 gallon bucket. And the 7 gallon bucket still has 5 gallons from the previous step.<br>  <br>  So there are 5 gallons in the 10 gallon bucket and 5 gallons in the 7 gallon bucket.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! It might be easier to draw pictures of each step to see it better.<br>  <br>  Does anybody else remember this type of riddle from the movie Die Hard With a Vengeance? :P

The ball is headed at 120 ft/sec at an angle and this number should be broke into a y-vector and an x-vector.<br>  <br>  Vertically, the ball is going 60 ft/s up initially.<br>  The acceleration is gravity, which is -32.17 ft/s^2.<br>  <br>  Horizontally, the ball is going 60*sqrt(3) ft/s.<br>  The distance = velocity times time, so to travel 350 ft it will take about 3.37 seconds.<br>  <br>  Using that time we can now look at the vertical distance of the ball at 350 ft horizontally away. <br>  S = So + Vo * t + 1/2 * g * t^2<br>  S = 4 + 60*3.37 + 1/2 * (-32.17) * (3.37)^2 = 23.5 ft<br>  <br>  This height won't clear the fence, but I do not believe anyone can jump that high either.

o91grX4zaa	Roughly speaking, if you see a "kink" in a function, it will not be differentiable there. For example draw out the function |x|, this should look like a "V" sitting at x = 0. Why is it not differentiable at x = 0? Because if you move slightly to the right of 0 you get slope 1 but if you move slightly to the left you get slope -1 i.e. kink at 0. Use the same reasoning for x^2-9x+20, draw out |x^2-9x+20| and see whether the absolute-value function produces similar kinks in |x^2-9x+20|.<br>  <br>  Hint: Pay attention to the real roots, if any, of x^2-9x+20.|`|AA10969890	x^2-9x+20 = (x-5)(x-4) = 0<br>  <br>  x=5 , x= 4<br>  <br>  at (4,5) f(x) = 9x - x^2 - 20<br>  <br>  for x < 4  or  x > 5 f(x) is the same<br>  <br>  if u find the derivative from right and left the values 4 and 5, they will be different. so f'(x) DNE at x = 4 and x = 5|`|0P6mAOk7aa	Use the definition of absolute value:  |x^2 - 9x + 20| =<br>  x^2 - 9x + 20, when x^2 - 9x + 20 >= 0,<br>  -(x^2 - 9x + 20), when x^2 - 9x + 20 < 0.  We notice that <br>  x^2 - 9x + 20 = (x - 4)(x - 5) is >= 0 when x <= 4 or x >= 5, and is < 0 when 4 < x < 5.  So the graph looks like the parabola x^2 - 9x + 20 with the portion that was below the x-axis flipped up as reflected in the x-axis.

KMQnebmTaa	I'm pretty sure your teacher has made a mistake, or you have miscopied the question, because that hint is useless for this problem.<br>  <br>  Go to the definition.  The derivative of F(x) at x = 0, if it exists, would be<br>  <br>  lim (h-->0)  [F(h) - F(0) ] /  h<br>  <br>  Now unpack the function: we get<br>  lim (h-->0) (  (sin h)/h   - 1 ) / h<br>  <br>  This simplifies to lim (h-->0)  (sin h - h) / (h^2).   (I'll let you work out that piece of algebra.)  Now, does this limit exist, and what is it?<br>  <br>  If you just plug in h=0 you get 0/0, an indeterminate form.  So instead use L'hospital's rule and take the derivative of both the numerator and denominator:  You get (cos h - 1) / (2h).   Oh, no -- it's STILL indeterminate for h = 0!  Okay, use L'hospital again:  now we've got<br>   - sin h / 2, which -- good news -- works out JUST FINE for h = 0.  The conclusion is that the derivative of the function exists (and is zero) at x=0.  So the function is differentiable there.<br>  <br>  Now I *think* that your teacher actually has a different question in mind, namely: is the derivative CONTINUOUS at x=0?  For that, the hint could be useful.  Alternatively you could take the derivative for all values of x other than zero (the quotient rule works well, here):  it's<br>  <br>  (sin x - x cosx) / (x^2)<br>  <br>  Then the question could be approached by saying:  What is the limit of this function as x-->0, and is it the same as the value of the derivative at x=0 (which, remember, we already worked out to be 0).  But here again I think you need to use L'hospital.

PsCCd63yaa	The important part of the problem is the very first part - given f(x)=x.  So, try substituting that into your two composition functions:<br>  f(g(x)) = g(x) because f of ANYTHING is just what's on the inside.<br>  <br>  g(f(x)) = g(x) because you can simply replace f(x) with x.<br>  <br>  Thus, they're equal!<br>  <br>  Let's think about what this means in terms of function "machines".  Let's say you have two machines, and one machine just spits out whatever number you give to it.  Let's say you have another random machine.  If you hook the machines up with the first machine going first, and handing its output to the second machine, you get this:<br>  <br>  x --f(x) operates to give---> x -------g(x) operates to give ----> g(x)<br>  <br>  Now if you change the order of the machines, you get this:<br>  <br>  x ------g(x) operates to give----> g(x) ------f(x) operates to give ----> g(x)<br>  <br>  This is a special case - it is NOT generally true that f(g(x))=g(f(x)).  It's special because f(x) = x.|`|Nk3eQbM7aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  You can freely substitute 'blah' for f('blah') because of what you were given.<br>  <br>  So, f(g(x)) = g(x) and g(f(x)) = g(x). Both expressions = g(x), so they're equal to each other.

PsCCd63yaa	The most important part of the problem is that each box is labelled INCORRECTLY!  Therefore, if a box says BB on it, both balls can't be black.<br>  <br>  Let's use this fact.  Open up the box that says BW and grab one ball.  Let's say it's white.  Then the other ball is white too!  If the other ball were black, the box would be labelled correctly.  So, the BW box really is WW.<br>  <br>  Now, we have two boxes labelled WW and BB.  We also have balls in the combo BW and BB, since we already took two white balls out.  The box with BB on the label can't have the BB balls, so the BB box has two white balls.  That leaves the WW box containing BW balls.<br>  <br>  Just flip/flop the blacks and whites if you pick out a black ball from your BW box.  The key is to ALWAYS pick a ball from the BW box.  Since the BW box can't contain one ball of each color, it must contain both balls of the same color, and once you grab a ball, you know which color that is!|`|QCTdN4HBaa	Peek at the box BW.  You know it's labeled incorrectly, so it's either a WW or a BB in reality.  If you get a B when you peek, then label this box BB.  There are two remaining boxes, labeled BW and WW.  These are labeled incorrectly too, so switch the labels and everything is right.<br>  If you get a W when you peek, then label the box WW and then switch the labels on the remaining two boxes, and everything is right again.|`|sfUUml0Daa	so what exactally is the question?

As that happens, two things are happening simultaneously:  h is shrinking down to zero, and the secant line is starting to look more and more like the tangent line.

ETeGMlRWaa	breakeven in units is fixed costs divided by the contribution margin<br>  <br>  So you have to find contribution margin first.  To find that, you need sales minus all variable costs.  So, that's 80-40.  The contribution margin is 40.  <br>  <br>  Take your fixed costs of 680,000 and divide that by 40.  That gives you 17,000 rooms to be rented per year to breakeven.<br>  <br>  If the hotel rents every room every day, that is 113,150 rooms.  You only need 17,000 rented.  So 17,000 is 15% of 113,150.  That number is rounded btw.  It's more like 15.02%  That's your answer.<br>  <br>  For breakeven in sales dollars:  it's fixed costs divided by cmr.<br>  Contribution margin ratio (cmr) is the contribution margin divided by sales.  <br>  <br>  40 divided by 80 is 50%  Take 680,000 divided by 50% and they need $1,360,000 to breakeven.  Which is the same as 17,000 rooms times $80 per day.
GASTNilgaa	So far so good, the radius is indeed 3.  <br>  <br>  But where's the center?  The normal vector points at it!  <br>  <br>  So you can get there by starting at r(3) and traveling 3 units in the direction specified by the unit normal to get it.  So the center is<br>  <br>  r(3) + 3N = <1,-3,2> + <0, -3, 0> = <1, -6, 2>.<br>  <br>  The osculating plane goes through r(3) and has normal given by <br>  <br>  T x N = <2/5, 0, 1/5><br>  <br>  which I could always scale if I like to <2, 0, 1>.<br>  <br>  The plane through r(3) = <1,-3,2> with normal <2,0,1> has equation<br>  <br>  <2,0,1> dot <x,y,z> = <2,0,1> dot <1,-3,2> or<br>  <br>  2x + z  = 4<br>  <br>  (Note that our center <1,-6,2> is indeed in this plane because 2(2)+2=4, and you can check directly that r(3) is also on the plane for the same reason.)<br>  <br>  To parametrize the circle, here's a general fact.  The circle with radius r, center C, and lying in the plane through C that contains orthogonal unit directions e1 and e2 can be parametrized by<br>  <br>  C + e_1 (r cos t) + e_2(r sin t), <br>  where t runs over [0, 2pi] (or all of R, if you don't mind traveling over the circle more than once)<br>  <br>  You might think about why this formula works.  See if you can convince yourself, for example, that it does lie on the plane through C that contains the directions e1 and e2, and that every point on this curve is a distance r from C.  You should also convince yourself that if e1 and e2 are not unit vectors, the formula will still parametrize a curve in the plane through C containing the directions e1 and e2, but that it will be an ellipse instead of a circle.  If you take e1 and e2 to be the standard basis vectors in R^2, you might also recognize this parametrization as one you've used before in two dimensions.  With C = (0,0) you get the f(t) = (cos t, sin t) parametrization of the unit circle, for example.<br>  <br>  Here, C = <1, -6, 2>, r = 3, and we can take e_1 = T(3)/||T(3)|| and e_2 = N(3).  We need to normalize T(3) because the recipe requires unit vectors.  I get e_1 = <-1/sqrt(5), 0, 2/sqrt(5)>, so<br>  <br>  f(t) = <1, -6, 2> + <-1/sqrt(5),0,2/sqrt(5)> 3 cos t + <0, -1, 0> 3 sin t<br>  = <1 - (3 cos t)/sqrt(5), -6 - 3 sin t, 2 + (6 cos t)/sqrt(5)><br>  is the circle.<br>  <br>  You can check that r(3) is on it, it corresponds to the point t = 3pi/2.  Then sin t = -1 and cos t = 0 so that<br>  <br>  f(3pi/2) = <-1, -6 + 3, 2> = <-1, -3, 2> = r(3).<br>  <br>  You could also doublecheck that f(t) lies in the plane whose equation we gave earlier, because if we take x = 1 - (3 cos t)/sqrt(5) and z = 2 + (6 cos t)/sqrt(5) then 2x + z is indeed 4 because the cosine terms cancel.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!
SWJWOxSWaa	I'll start by assuming that y=a*e^(2t) for some real number a, and then plug my guess in for y and see if I can figure out what a must be. Often times guess and check is the fastest way to do a problem like this. So, assuming y=a*e^(2t) we find:<br>  y'= 2a*e^(2t)<br>  y''=4a*e^(2t).<br>  Now, I plug y, y', and y'' into y'' - 2y' - 3y, and I get:<br>  y'' - 2y' - 3y=4a*e^(2t)-2*(2a*e^(2t))-3*(a*e^(2t))=...<br>  Since we already know y'' - 2y' - 3y = 3e^(2t), we now have <br>  -3a*e^(2t) = 3e^(2t).<br>  So, a=-1, and y=-e^(2t).|`|0wPkOJEhaa	No I can't

So, to get to know the amount of apples in one pile (y) you should subtract the other pile (x) from the total pile. (Or the other way around) <br>  Right ?<br>  we get pile y = total pile (5) minus pile x<br>  y=5 - x or x=5 - y<br>  Ok ?<br>  <br>  Another way of saying it is that you can do anything with an equation like this, just as long as you do the same thing on both sides of the "=".<br>  So you can get rid of the "x" on the left by subtracting it, but you have to do the same thing on the right hand side too.<br>  So, we have an "x" on the left and we take it away, but as we have to do the same on the right we get "5 - x" there.<br>  Only a "y" left on one side and 5 and a minus "x" on the other.<br>  Ok?<br>  <br>  2. Now we can use the last method as negative apple piles are a bit hard to imagine (and I′m a bit too sleepy..)<br>  <br>  We have - 3x+y= - 2<br>  Ok, how do we get rid of the "x"es on the left? we just take them out!<br>  But.. we have to do the same on the other side to keep the balance right !<br>  The problem is, the "x"es are already gone (negative), so we have to do the opposite to get rid of them, put them in !<br>  So we get -3x+3x+y=-2+3x<br>  Ok?<br>  -3x+3x is nothing, like filling a hole with the dirt you just dug out, there won′t be a hole and neither a pile.<br>  So we get y=-2+3x and to make it look a bit better you write<br>  y=3x-2<br>  <br>  I hope you got it and that you can do the rest yourself !<br>  Good luck and think of apples..|`|LUpq3GONaa	man a equation having two unknowns cannot be solved perfectly.It can be, when another equation of same kind is there or any conditions with problem.

By using the information given, you can construct two different equations, and then solve for each of the variables.<br>  <br>  Start with the first sentence.  By using the fact that x and y added together will equal 900, the first equation is:<br>  <br>  x + y = 900<br>  <br>  Now, the second statement.  Percentages are often expressed as decimals when working with them in equations, and that is what we'll do here.  1 is the same as 100%, so 4% is .04 and 7% is .07.  Now we can form the equation:<br>  <br>  .04x + .07y = 48 <br>  <br>  We now have two equations for which we can find x and y.  They are:<br>  <br>  x + y = 900<br>  .04x + .07y = 48<br>  <br>  We can solve this equation by manipulating the first equation then adding it to the second.  Multiply each side of the first equation by -.04 to make it so when both equations are added, that x cancels out:<br>  <br>  -.04x - .04y = -36<br>  <br>  Now we'll add this to the second equation to eliminate x altogether:<br>  <br>       -.04x - .04y = -36<br>  +    .04x + .07y = 48<br>  -----------------------------<br>         0x   + .03y  = 12<br>  <br>  Now, all we have to do is divide 12 by .03 to get the value of y:<br>  <br>  12/.03 = 1200/3 = 400 = y<br>  <br>  Therefore, y = 400.  Now all we have to do is plug y back into one of the equations and then get the value of x.  The first equation is much easier to work with, so we'll put y back into that one.  That gives:<br>  <br>  400 + x = 900, giving x = 500  <br>  <br>  We know that this works for the first equation, but we'll test it in the second equation just to make sure:<br>  <br>  (.04*500) + (.07*400) = 20 + 28 = 48<br>  <br>  This checks out correctly.  Therefor, the answer to this problem is:<br>  <br>  x = 500, y = 400<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!
