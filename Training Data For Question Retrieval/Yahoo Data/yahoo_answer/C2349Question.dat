20090306110818AA0UJoW	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	World History AP Test Study Group........Where to begin?	Okay, so our teacher recommended that for the AP World History test coming up in May, we should organize ourselves into study groups to prepare outside of school.  Well, I've done that, and our group is made up of seven people.  The thing is...   there's a lot of world history, believe it or not.  In class, we're only on chapter 23 out of like 38.        My question is, where do we start studying?  Should we just ask random questions out of the books?  Focus on vocabulary?  Or start learning what we have yet to cover in class?      Advice/answers/comments are greatly appreciated.      Thanks C:

I want to get my master's in public administration and I know which school I wantto go to. The staff is great, they offer really good classes, and the program seems like a really good fit for me. AND they offered me a full scholarship. The only problem is that because this school's MPA program is still relatively new (10 yrs. Old), the program has not been accredited yet (the school IS accredited, however). The program is offered "in conjunction" with another school's MPA program (which is accredited) and I don't know what that means. Will my degree be from the non-accredited program (the one offering me a scholarship), or from the accredited program? Is it a waste of time to get your MPA from a non-accredited program, or does it even matter that much? Please help!!!      Thank you :)

I first heard it in a song ("A Pitcher Of Summer" by Kayo Dot), and have since tried to find reference to it elsewhere. Unfortunately, searches on the Internet usually direct me to the word "etheric" instead, or I find vague mentions relating to superstition, astral projection or reincarnation that don't quite clue me in to its meaning. In the song, it sounds as though it is pronounced like "cleric", using the use of "th" sounded as a soft "l" (as in the most proper pronunciation of "Cthulhu"). If anyone knows anything about this strange word, please let me know!

20090306211435AAIkuno	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What do I do? Seeking advise to get into a good university (mainly about clearing) PLEASE HELP!?	SORRY ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THIS! ID BE VERY GRATEFUL IF IT WAS READ :)      I've applied to uni already for sep 2009 to do single Geography and received 5 conditional offers from Keele, Hull, Gloucestershire, Canterbury Christ Church and Kingston. I didn't do well at AS level and my predicted grades were CCD (for me this is very bad and i was in tears on results day. The average in my school is around AAB) and i felt like my future was ruined. It was my aim to get at least BBB, but things went completely wrong for many reasons.      The problem is that i had my heart set on going to a far better uni than the ones i've applied for (e.g. a London uni such as Kings, SOAS, Royal Holloway, Queen Mary....Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester,  Southampton, Liverpool...you get the idea. Now looking at this list you must think its a joke that I can hope to get into them, but i really am determined to do it by working hard (im not as slack as i was before)and getting good a-level results...if im lucky maybe BBB's or more! Then applying for clearing to get into a better place once i recieve my results. - IS THIS POSSIBLE??? IF IT ISNT PLEASE TELL ME! -      However, i have done my research and i know some things:   - If i wish to go through clearing after seeing a good place in the listings, i will have to ask to be relieved from my firm and insurance offers first   - It takes a few days maybe a couple weeks for this to be processed   - Is this risky as the good places will have been taken by then? < i am very worried about this! Then i will be in serious trouble and maybe not even go to uni.   - I am trying to get hold of last years clearing list to see my chances. Do i have a good chance at all?      Some things about me that may be useful:      - I CANNOT take a gap year...my parents insist that i go to uni next year or if i do badly then repeat year 13 (i dont even know if thats possible...to repeat just one year- the syllabus has changed too)   - My GCSE's : 1 A*, 6 A's, 3 B's and 1 C      Please advise me what to do especially in terms of clearing!!! I am so worried and need some answers to relax my mind.      Thank you so much

I have never hated a teacher in my life and right now I hate my math teacher so badly that I really couldn't care less if she would get really sick or get fired. Everyone in the grade hates her. She is so boring and is really bad at teaching. She's always passes out assignments and doesn't tell us how to do it, she just says "If you get it wrong, you should try going over it." I don't usually have hard time in her class because I practice at home a grade ahead, but lots of my friends fail her class. I often help and tutor my friends during class, and I think she is annoyed by the fact that they aren't asking her. She is always blaming me for "chatting" with other people (She mentioned that to my parents during conference). She accused me of cheating (even though she didn't have any proof) because I got straight 100s on her tests. She emailed my parents and every single teacher in the school about it. One time I finished the assignments early and I was working on homework from the other class, and she said "That is not related to math" and ripped my homework in half. When I'm absent she gives me zeros on assignments I've missed. She always picks on me during class though I'm able to answer her questions correctly. I think she simply hates me. I don't even know why. I don't have problem with other classes but it's hard to concentrate in math when she is always blaming me for everything. I currently have an A-(borderline B) because she gave me zeros on my absent days(I was sick for about a week). If I get a B at the end of trimester which is next Wednesday then I wont be able to skip geometry. I'm trying my best but my grade keeps falling. I just hate her so much. Help.

This being the case, it might be considered important that there be a clear definition of dishonesty. Sadly, there is no such definition in the Theft Act and the cases which have considered this concept have failed to achieve precision in defining the concept. Rather than provide a definition, section 2, of the Theft Act 1968 specifies three situations in which someone’s appropriation is not to be    regarded as dishonest(1) and one situation in which it may be regarded as dishonest(2).

I'm a third-year at a top 10 university hoping to attend a top 3 law school.  I was selected for a Department of State Critical Language Scholarship to study Arabic in the Middle East.      The problem is, I already have two highly competitive internships lined up back-to-back this summer.  Are they worth giving up for the Critical Language Scholarship?      How well-known is CLS?  How competitive is it?  Crudely put, how much will it impress admission committee at top law schools (Yale, Harvard, et al.)?

I'm just trying to have all the facts before I make any final commitments.

20090307112017AAaQCWH	Education & Reference;Home Schooling	Are there any online qualifications a schoolgirl can do at home - even though she is full time in school?	My daughter is just coming up to being 14yrs old ( going on 20 if you get my drift- very mature mentally) and has a very active mind and seeks stimulation that will be productive to her ambitions.    She has already opted for triple science as this will put her in good stead for her A levels.    My daughter enjoys anything to do with Forensic medicine etc and has a very strong yearn in this direction- Are there any online courses she can do from home that will enhance her chances of completing her A levels with ease OR simply because she likes anthropology and forensic science?    If it's just something for leisure but proves to be productive then surely her efforts will be noted.       I heard there was an O'level equivalent in Forensic Science called a 'Level 2' and was hoping she could do this online as it will almost certainly help her with her schooling and also put her in good stead for her future whilst at the same time satisfy her appetite for knowledge and give her more of a stepping stone- I personally don't believe she would be doing herself any harm as this would not be a chore- more like an interesting pastime with winnings- she loves the subject material that she has already aquired and shows a little more than just a fascination - but a passion for it.       WHAT DO YOU KNOW- Please help with any info?????

The 5yo is working on 1-3rd  grade material, the 4yo has just begun K, and the 3yo is at preschool ability. I really like K12 for English , History ,SCience and I like because my son can work at his own level (which is 3rd grade in reading and 1st in Math).    Also I like because it is free . With 4 children it is hard to provide money for a private curriculum.      Is it reasonable to think that I might be able to keep up with all four little ones with the level of teacher involvement required with K12 materials?

20090307121318AASvhdH	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	A challenging question about mitosis/meiosis. Can you please help?	The result of mitosis is that the daughter cells end up with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This is achieved by chromosome duplication followed by cell division. Consider an alternative, hypothetical process, in which cells undergo cell division first and then chromosomes get duplicated in each daughter cell.      a.) How would the results of mitosis differ between the two processes of cell division? Be specific!      b.) Given the differences you have given in (a), do you think the hypothetical process would be equally effective at maintaining chromosome number in daughter cells? Why or why not? Draw the actual and hypothetical alternative scenarios and compare/contrast. (4)   (HINT: What is the purpose of mitosis? Does this new process effectively satisfy that purpose?    c.) Now imagine that this hypothetical process occurs in meiosis. How would the end products differ between the actual and hypothetical meiotic processes? Draw the actual and hypothetical processes and compare/contrast.

20090307120517AA1leAW	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How exactly does "Med School" in the U.S work?	Hey guys! I'm a bit confused about the concept of "Med School". I want to study medicine, and in the country I live (Spain), I can begin studying medicine the very first year of college. All I do is apply for a medicine degree, and if my GPA is high enough, I get enrolled in that college.       By first year of college I'm referring to the year right after finishing High School. I'm 17 and I'm in my senior year, so I'll get into college when I'm 18. Apparently, in the united states is different, since you have to study something else at college before getting into medicine o.o? Also there's no "med schools" in Spain, it's just a degree at a college, there is a special building for med classes though, duh.      Anyways, thanks for the answers!      p.s Admission to college in Spain is solely based on the GPA you obtain. There's a set number of slots at a university for any given degree, and they start filling those slots up with the applicants with the highest GPA.

I graduated from undergrad in 2007 with a BA in psychology. I am considering going to a graduate program in clinical psychology or drama therapy (there are only two drama therapy programs in the U.S.  I already didn't get into one, but I did at least get an interview).         I have a friend earning her masters in marriage and family therapy, at Pepperdine, and she always tells me how bad she wants me to come to that school, and I'm willing, but there's one problem:  I have a little field experience ( which is good), and I am able to write an excellent personal statement, but my cumulative GPA was waay below exceptional (like, a 2.8 or 9) = /   my psychology GPA is probably a 3.5 (I'm not exactly sure, but it's about like that).  I am sure that if I were accepted into a program, I would perform much better, but with the competitiveness of most graduate programs, I wonder about the likleyhood of my even getting the chance to attend a respectable program!

20090307140819AALJiAL	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Should I take the Spring Quarter of College off to help bail myself out of debt?	I’m a 21 year old college student. Unlike some students I use my credit cards to help buy my books and help pay for fees. I do have Hope but it doesn’t pay for everything. Plus the school I go to isn’t eligible for a lot of financial aid, trust me I’ve tried, which is why I’m going to transfer to a better school later. So Over the past 3 years I’ve accumulated over $4,000 worth of debt and its starting to get harder to pay my bills. I lost my job a few months ago and every since then just to survive I’ve been living off my credit cards, (which is dumb I know but its buying me time to find another job) Its only a matter of time before I default, but there is a way out to prevent that. I have a few jobs offers right now and I have the opportunity to work full time. Bottom line is that my debt is starting to get overwhelming and dealing with that stress along with school is starting to get to me.  Winter Quarter ends in a few weeks, so is it a good idea to skip the Spring Quarter to help get myself out of debt?  Plus I don't want to have worry about keeping good grades while having my overwhelming debt in the back of my head.  I can return in the Summer Quarter or if I need longer I’ll go back in the fall. My parents think it’s a good idea but I’m not sure.

20090307144724AAUseJg	Education & Reference;Teaching	Can someone explain the education system to me in the US?	I'm in Ireland, and its fairly easy to understand the classes etc. from 2 and a half to about 4 you go to playschool if you want, not compulsory, then at 4/5 you start Primary school in Junior Infants, then Senior infants for 5/6 year olds, then first class, second class (where children make their communion, usually 7 or 8), then 3rd (8/9 yo), 4th(9/10 y/o),5th(10/11) and 6th(11/12) class (where they make their confirmation). then you start Secondary school in 1st year, 2nd year and in 3rd year you do you first state exam the Junior Cert (ten or eleven subjects examined), then you can optionally do 4th year (called transition year where the focus is on extra curricular experiences) or go straight onto 5th year, then 6th year where you do your second state exam, the Leavin Cert (examined in 6/7 subjects). and then you can choose college or to get a trade or whatever.   but in the US it seems real complicated, with Juniors and seniors and all that? anyone enlighten me?

20090307145549AAK6mwf	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Getting into college (NYU, BU, USC.....)?	Hey you guys! I’m currently a Junior at a Texas high school, and I wanted to ask a few questions…      First, I’ll give you a little of my information:      GPA: 3.37   Current IB Diploma Student   I took a lot of regulars classes last year (I had a hard summer between my freshman/soph year, so my high school counselor “suggested” that I take easier classes…)   This year I am in ALL pre-ap/AP/IB classes.      My schedule this year, and grades:   Pre AP Pre Cal (1st six weeks: 73; 2nd six weeks: 67; 3rd six weeks: 70; sem 1 avg: 71; 4th six weeks: 81)   IB English III (1st six weeks: 81; 2nd six weeks: 84; 3rd six weeks: 90; sem 1 avg: 84; 4th six weeks: 86)   AP Latin III (1st six weeks: 90; 2nd six weeks: 92; 3rd six weeks: 89; sem 1 avg: 92; 4th six weeks: 84-she lost one of my tests….)   Pre AP Physics I (1st six weeks: 85; 2nd six weeks: 85; 3rd six weeks: 85; sem 1 avg: 82; 4th six weeks: 90)   Honors Aquatic Science (1st six weeks: 89; 2nd six weeks: 86; 3rd six weeks: 84; sem 1 avg: 89; 4th six weeks: 95)   IB Psychology (1st six weeks: 87; 2nd six weeks: 91; 3rd six weeks: 84; sem 1 avg: 88; 4th six weeks: 84)   IB History (1st six weeks: 90; 2nd six weeks: 86; 3rd six weeks: 92; sem 1 avg: 91; 4th six weeks: 84)      So far I have 22 credits, and I know you only need 24 to graduate. By the end of this year, I will have 25.5 and by the end of next year I will have 36 credits…      This is my schedule for next year (or rather the classes I’m taking):   AP Calculus AB (1 credit)   IB English IV (1 credit)   AP/IB Latin IV (1 credit)   IB Biology II (1 credit)   IB Biology II Labs (before school- 0.5 credit)   AP Independent Study and Analysis of Film (1 credit)   AP Literary Genre (1 credit)   IB Theory of Knowledge (1 credit)   IB History of the Americas (1 credit)   After school Speech and Debate (first time joining-on a 5.0 scale-so its honors-and I’ll get 1 credit from it)      I took the SAT in january, but i only got an 1800 (im in classes to improve my score, and i KNOW i can do better-i was really sick the week before and the day of-i was continually blacking out and throwing up and getting dizzy) so i've scheduled to take it again, under better circumstances. Plus, since having taken that SAT, ive also been put on medicine for ADD and its helping wonders as well.         I do a lot of community service. So far I have 122 hours. I’m also in Green Club, River Watch, Little Theater Company, Brightoners (we go to Brighton Gardens-old folks home-twice a month during lunch), Cheese Club and Film Club.       I worked for my dad (on payroll) for 2 years (all of 8th grade through 9th), I interned at a Fabric Store this summer for a few weeks, and I babysit.      I recently took a Digital Filmmaking class outside of school, Ive taken a photography class and this summer I'm spending three weeks at an intensive acting camp in Los Angeles (Young Actors Camp). I also am spending 13 days at UC Berkeley for NSLC (National Student Leadership Conference), under the program Journalism and Mass Communication, this summer.          I have a college counselor who is helping me organize everything and apply and all that.      I take the SAT again next Saturday, the ACT in April, and the SAT II subject tests in may.       I also spend a TON of time at my church-volunteering and helping out. Sundays and tuesdays I lead groups for middle schoolers and high schoolers (girls) and wednesday nights I attend the high school services.       I've missed quite a bit of school because I get ill frequently and its always really severe, never something simple, but i always get everything made up and get caught up on time, and it rarely hurts my grades.      I’m also hoping to volunteer at the Blanton (art museum) this summer when I get home.          Colleges I’m really interested in:      NYU (applying early decision, probably)   Boston University   USC   UCLA   Pepperdine   UC Berkeley   UC Santa Barbara   UC San Diego   Brown (I might apply early decision here-NYU isn’t early decision restrictive)   U Cal Irvine   U Cal Davis   American University   Penn State University Park   University of Washington (in Seattle)   Georgetown (in DC) (I might apply early decision here instead)   Vanderbilt (though I don’t know for sure about this. And if I did apply here, I might apply early decision, but again, I really don’t know.)   Carnegie Mellon (My cousin went for college, and they begged her to come back for grad school and paid her entire way. She told me that that raises my chances of getting in there, but I’m not sure haha)   Northwestern   Stanford      So, what are my chances at these schools? Which are a pretty good possibility, which are a possibility, which are a reach, and which are out of the question? Please tell me what you think! And no rude comments please…I know my GPA is low, and I know I didn’t do well in Pre Cal this year, but I’m trying.       Also if you know of any other good schools in Cali or New York that I should look into, that I could have a shot at getting in, let me know! Thanks
