They found my resume on monster and emailed me about a job opening that they had. The email says that they are called Comstars International Group. The contract that they sent me says it pays $30,000 per year and the information for the job says:       You will be responsible for receiving, controlling the quality of the packages and shipping them out  to our clients with your local postal service (working with pre-paid shipping labels).          1. Packages will go directly to your home address.       2. Before each package arrives we will notify you by phone or by email.       3. Basic salary is 1000$ per 20 received, checked and sent out packages (guaranteed monthly).       4. Payouts are made after you have served 10 packages, by your preferred payment method (PayPal, Western Union or Check)   I just want to make sure this isn't a scam before I sign anything. I looked their website up but it really didn't say alot. They haven't asked me for money or anything like that but I figured someone out there might know something about them.

20090227104048AA9Wzlp	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	70k in debt. Should I declare bankruptcy?	My 2nd husband and I both had wretched divorces and ended up with enormous consumer debt because of it. We sold our tiny house, moved for a job and now are in a tiny apartment. We can pay our bills every morning, have not missed payments, but are unable to make any headway because of high interest payments. We'd like to buy a house, but can't save. My husband may be losing his job this summer and then we won't be able to make all of our payments (I work as well). Any suggestions? I believe I created this debt, and feel that I should pay it off, but I'm getting into a corner i don't know I can get out of. Suggestions?

The lease states no cohabitation. It does not say i can not have over night guests nor does it say i can't have sex. (it will make sense in a minute) It also doesn't state i have to turn my heat off during the day. it does state my utilities are included. My boyfriend stayed the night two nights because he works 2nd shift and by the time he gets here its late. he's been around my kids since before my daughter was a yr old. she's 6 now. on sat morning my landlord informs me it isn't going to 'work out' and wants me to move. she then stated she would give me half my deposit back. i told her she was asking me to move and expected to only give me half of back and i would expect it all back. she then said fine. she then proceeded to ask me if my boyfriend and i have sex etc and  i told her it was none of her business and she began to preach to me i shut the door in her face. she then called me not too long after and began to preach again. she called again on sunday and preached to me again and i told her to leave me alone and stop basing everything on assumptions since i wouldn't answer her questions. basically she's evicting me based on her personal beliefs and what she thinks we're doing together. she all but called me a prostitute and kept telling me how horrible of a person i am. she now gave me 30 days notice to leave and threatened to call the cops if he stayed the night. i know she can't have him removed and she also has to go to court to evict. but i'm leaving anyway as soon as i find some where else to live because i'm not dealing with harassment. she also came into my apt and turned my heat off the first day and told me i wasn't to leave it on all day while i wasn't here and there are no heating units in the back half of the apt. she then came down sat when it was 75 degrees out and turned it on then in the conversation on sunday accused me of leaving it on and it made her have to turn on her a/c and she would deduct the excess amount for her electric bill from my deposit. i want to report her for discrimination and unlawful eviction, but have no idea where in va i would do that. any help would be good. i am contacting a lawyer in case she tries to keep or skimp on my deposit.

I am pretty sure that we both have good credit, and I have past renting experience (though it was for student housing). We can definitely pay the monthly rent, and have enough money saved up.      Would being jobless factor in so much that our application would be denied?   Could we show them bank statements to show that we do have enough funds?   I have a potential person who can become our guarantor, but I would rather not go that route.       Thanks for your time everyone! And we appreciate it.

20090309205329AAWweLj	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Terrible landlords....?	We are currently renting a basement apartment from a family in DC and we have been continuously mistreated, the most recent of events being their huge dog being in our apartment when we were gone and leavin a huge pile of poop on our floor.  I consider this a hazard to my 13 month old, who could have easily discovered it before we did.  We were gone and they thought it'd be ok if their stupid dog secretly ran around our apartment doing who knows what while they did laundry.  They also come downstairs without warning to do laundry, which was not part of our original agreement.  And the noise level is beyond ridiculous.  Just 20 mins ago, at 11:25pm, their dog was running around like crazy and also their 4 year old girl who I would guess isn't playing with a full deck, as evidenced by her constant screaming.   Short of moving, what can we do?  Is there anything illegal about their dog pooping in our house when we were gone?  I am so pissed.  We are moving ASAP.   :L

20090309233523AA55zyN	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	My roof is leaking AGAIN. How can I break this lease?	Every single time it has rained heavily since we moved into this apartment the roof has leaked. We have taken photos, made videos of it, etc. My cell phone bill shows every single time I have called the landlord and I never call him just to chat, it is for repairs.      Sure, he is going about coming over within 24 hours to "fix" the leak, but the same spots keep leaking and leaking no matter what cheap patch he puts on. He assures me he will get the roof redone, but hes trying to find a cheaper estimate.      The bottom line is I have a 1 year old child who gets stuck playing in the kitchen some days because the living room, bedroom, and entry way leak on and off whenever we have heavy rain.      Since he does make a small effort to fix the roof after every complaint do I have any right to break my lease? This is getting stupid. I can't keep furniture in parts of the house because I need the area below the leaky spots to be clear so nothing gets wet.      I live in Illinois if that helps.

I am trying to decide whether I should go or not because the new job starts next Tuesday which is one of my 2 class days so tomorrow is my last chance to go to that class and make arrangements, plus I need to talk to some people. I don't really want to go because it is such a hassle but I don't want to burn any bridges in the television field. I'm almost positive I won't take that job.      Should I go anyways?      Also, the internship I got said they want me to stay 3 months. But that is after school is done and I made plans to road trip it back the 24 hours home with my parents and save money.   So I can either work there the 3 months and get some monetary compensation and in the off chance it leads to a job (not sure if I want to work there) or stay there until the end of the school year and then peace out graciously. That's ideal, but I don't want to burn bridges. But if I plan to stay for 3 months I would have to start making living arrangements and commitments now since residence will be up by then.       What do you think about that part?      Thanks so much. I am so stressed out!

20090309212234AAi6ryw	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	How can I get my life back on track?	Sorry if this may be a bit dramatic...      I feel like my life is over already, and I'm only 24.  I am a complete loser, and my hopelessness has occasionally even made me feel suicidal lately.  I used to be so motivated in my life to succeed, and in undergrad I achieved a really high GPA and was able to land some pretty good jobs after college.  I feel like the turning point was about a year and a half ago, when I broke up with my long term bf... I hadn't ever had a chance to really be single as an adult, and I just went wild.  Since then I spent almost every night partying and all I cared about was booze, drugs, and random sex.  It led to me dropping out of grad school (I was able to somehow get a medical withdrawal, but still, it looks pathetic) and I moved back in with my mom because I was in so much debt.  But this still didn't stop me from dumbly continuing to make having fun my #1 priority, up until about last month.      So now I am about a week away from losing my current temporary job contract (which is already several notches below the jobs I used to have), and have been rejected from the postbaccalaureate program I just applied to (a program with an embarrassingly high acceptance rate).  I feel like I have completely dropped the ball in my life and I don't know how to get my **** together again, because no schools will accept me anymore and I am a weak job candidate in such a bad economy.  And I can't be unemployed or just doing nothing, because I absolutely have to have health insurance due to a chronic serious disease.  Until I'm 25, I can still qualify under my dad's insurance as long as I'm a student, so I have been taking classes at the local junior college lately.  It was the worst feeling in the world when some 19 year old in one of my classes asked "What are you doing here?" after I mentioned I had a bachelor's degree.  I didn't even know what to say.  It doesn't help that literally ALL my friends are in good-paying successful jobs or grad school.      Now that I know I'm losing my job in a few days, I've been totally freaking out.  In the last month I've completely stopped partying and have been taking steps to be responsible again.  But I feel like I did so much damage to my life by making all these idiotic choices that it's impossible to come back to what my potential used to be.  Has anyone else ever experienced this kind of downturn into loserville, and somehow got out of it?  I am so scared that I'm going to be a loser forever, and I don't even know where to start with fixing my life.  I know that this is all my fault and I probably deserve this, so I really don't need anyone telling me "Yeah, you're a failure, what were you thinking".  I already know that and kick myself every day for this.  But I just want to hear if anyone else has any experience/insight on getting your life back on track.

I just found out about these so I'm looking to see if any of you can clarify if one could use a Bank CD the same way they use an HYIP site?

A couple of years ago, when the housing market was strong, my friend purchased some real estate and offered me the tax claim on a house in San Diego as long as I lent my name (I had great credit) as "buyer" to help him get the loan. The deal was I put my name on it, he makes all the payments and the property gets rented out.  I never imaged he would miss three payments in a row and not tell me, but that is exactly what happened and now my credit score sank, my credit card APRs rose to 30%, and I can't refinance my home which I despereately need to do because if things are going the way they're going, my adjustable rate mortgage is going to knock me on my butt within 1-2 years.  I know it was a stupid move to do business with him NOW but I really need advice on what kind of options I have.  What can I do to UNDO the damage done to my credit?

I'm working with a Community Redevelopment Corp (503c), and we're looking to raise substantial capital ($22M) to acquire numerous lots in the community (though the city, tax liens, foreclosures, & landlords - community is in blight). This is part of a considerable effort for us to rebuild the community - we're redeveloping the entire neighborhood and are partnered up with the city (Philly) and building relationships with local investors and businesses to help make this happen. This money will be used to obtain our planned commercial districts. We're offering a 20% return for this investment - but more importantly, we're looking for people that are in this with a positive spirit - helping us rebuild homes (vs. driving out residents through gentrification) is better than any profit.

I get positive reviews from coworkers, customers, etc..However I called in sick once in January and I no called no show today (I didn't feel good and I accidently overslept. It was an accident.)      Also I requested a day off 7 weeks ago for this Saturday (March 14) and they rejected my offer. I talked to the person that does the schedules (shes one of my managers) and she said she would fix it. That was a week ago and she hasn't done anything. I'm a stocker and a lot of stockers are going out of town that week since it's Spring Break but I really need to have that day off. I've tried seeing if I could switch with someone, but to no avail.       So I had a no call no show today and I plan calling in on Saturday and I also requested for 2 days off (also 7 weeks ago) in April. So does this have any ground for Wal-Mart to fire me? Should I call in for the day I requested time off for? (I'm going out of town for the day)

We already signed a lease for an apartment that smells kind of smoky. We assumed that the smoke was from the previous occupant and the landlord said that he would take care of it before we moved in. However, today we got the keys and it totally smells like an ashtray. We just realized the smoke is coming in through the air vents from the downstairs neighbors (who smoke!)      We already signed the lease and paid the deposit before realizing that the smoke is coming from downstairs. The landlord said he will change the filter but I am skeptical.      I have a one year old son, and asthma which is triggered by my severe allergies. I am worried about exposing my son to the cigarette smoke. I have an air purifier which is wonderful, but I am scared that it won't be enough if the neighbors are continually smoking like that.       The lease is with an individual landlord, and there are no other units available.       We are in Ohio, I am not sure what the laws are here. Oh, and the landlord is a lawyer.

20090227114421AAtnFgA	Business & Finance;Investing	Does Wall Street rely on asymmetric information?	I think it relies on deluding idiots into thinking they can out scam someone else.       Financial wizards, fully cognizant that they could never beat an average accounting for costs, try to convince investors that THEY know how other people behave, when this behavior is in effect (and by definition) variable.        Investing should be simple, owning American business forever asset-allocating along the way.      No question that patterns exist in short-term data, but the industry makes its money off looking for exceptions to these patterns, and using investors to be the idiots.      The great accomplices: CNBC, a 24/7 media, the internet, etc. that all encourage us to use our emotions to react to short-term information.

I pay less a week than they want me to, but I still pay it off.. It stands at about 2.8k      So I was deliberating if I should accept their offer or a reduced discounted rate to pay back If I pay it on lump sum.      I wanted to weigh up my options to see if it was worth it (I was suspicious I may have 1 other default on my rating) so I requested a copy of my rating from Veda.      So I got it in the email today... and there is nothing on it?   There is just 0's on it except for '2 credit applications'       Im confused - Shouldnt I have at least one default? or unpaid debt or something??      The application for the said credit card isnt even on there (though that was over 3 or 4 years ago)      So The real question I want to know is can a debt go to a collection agency without it affecting your credit rating?  Do they just black list your name if you dont payment plan or something with them?      Im just not if I have bad credit or not, and if I pay out the debt right now is my record clean??

Considering the rest of my debt, this is simply undoable.      Anyway, I believe the case has now been filed in court and I am waiting nervously to see when I'll be subpoenaed. A friend of mine suggested not answering the door so that I will have more time because supposedly I'll have 30 days to respond AFTER the subpoena is handed to me. Now I'm not answering the door but it is difficult because we get so many solicitors in this neighborhood and there's always people coming to the door.      Anyone have any suggestions or experience with this kind of issue? PLEASE, don't send me negative, discouraging remarks about my predicament. I'm feeling very distressed as it is and need people who will be non-judgmental.      Thanks so much.

20090227114832AAkN950	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	We didn't get our full tax refund?	We filed our taxes online through TaxAct. We've used Tax Act the past few years and have enjoyed the convenience of it very much, never had any problems. This year when we filed we were given our total to expect to be directly deposited into our account and the date..which was today. So today we checked our balance and saw that we did get our refund, only about $3000 short. We've tried looking everywhere on TaxAct for an explanation but can't find anything. We think it's possible my school loan was taken out as it was a past due payment and I never made payment arrangements with them. But we don't know for sure. Does anyone know where I can find this information. Where can I go or who can I call to find out where the missing funds went to? Thanks for your help!

20090507115906AAVDf6r	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Electric Company allowed someone else to change my billing address!!?	We are positively furious. We have both been Florida Power and Light customers since 2006 when we moved here. Since then, we've lived at two addresses. We stayed at the first address for one year, then moved into a new place where we have both been for over a year now without change. Every month, my fiance receives our bills and pays them online. He did not notice this until yesterday, but we stopped receiving our power bill from FPL 2 months ago. He received a phone call stating that we were two months past due and our power would be shut off this morning. My fiance frantically searched the house, thinking he might have misplaced the bills, but of course did not find them. The customer service rep was inconceivably rude and claimed that they had NOT ceased to send us our bills, but rather, they were now going to our "new address." We haven't moved in over a year. We explained that there must be some mistake, but she argued with him and said that someone had called and changed our billing address. Long story short, we spoke to several representatives including a Billing Supervisor who refused to give us any information about who called, when they called, and what address it was changed it. I was furious and demanded to know how they would allow anyone to call who is not authorized on the account and simply change our billing address. It seems like someone is lying here. The customer service reps said, "My system isn't showing me any information about the change. I can just tell you that someone called and changed your billing address so we started to forward your bills to the new address." Also, FPL no longer takes VISA - they only take mastercard and they REFUSED to allow us an extension so we could mail them a check and pay the bill. We finally spoke to a VERY, VERY rude woman who said that we had been paying on a "closed account" - I'm not sure what this has to do with anything, but FPL has always accepted our payments since we moved. There is so much in this situation that I'm confused about. What might have really happened here? NO ONE would have called and changed our billing address. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. We don't really even know anyone here and we have a locked mailbox. I'm FURIOUS that they refuse to give us, authorized account holders, any information about this mysterious "change of billing address" and refuse to explain how this could have happened. We can't switch power companies; they are the only service provider - which explains their AWFUL customer service and lack of regard. What can I do here? I have never been so outraged in my life. We spent 3 hours on the phone with them last night trying to get this figured out and everyone we spoke to, including a supervisor, was rude and refused to give us any information.

My question mainly can you add a fee to the late fee? I was told by two people in real estate that once I paid the rent the late fee stops. Most of the time if not paid with rent, or half of it, it goes toward your next months rent. Like I said I paid in the rent on the 6th, so should the late fee have a late fee as well? Btw my lease is four years old, it still states 15 dollars after the 5th and 2 dollars each day after til the "rent" is paid. I've paid late a few times two years ago and once I did the rent I just paid the 19 dollars i owed with the next months rent. So can a landlord do this?
