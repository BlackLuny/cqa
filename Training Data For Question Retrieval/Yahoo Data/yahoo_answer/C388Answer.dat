VfTTPijJaa	I find the sites below informative. Read on and decide what you can do. <br>  <br>  If I would you, I would keep my hands away from harsh chemicals like wear dishes rubber gloves while cleaning house or car. Keep nails short for a while you're taking care of it. <br>  <br>  I haven't try this but it can't hurt to soak nails into warm olive oil nightly. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you.

That's OK,just don't do the opposite, thats where it gets hazardous.    15amp = 14ga, 20amp = 12ga, 30amp = 10ga, 40amp = 8ga, 50amp = 6ga, 60amp = 4ga....The wire size has to get larger if you intend to go long distances because of voltage drop,but in normal wiring in a house there is no need.|`|2uZXCyeBaa	It's safe, but wire's cheap now so you might as well keep the wiring uniform throughout the circuit.  Is the #12 wire copper?  A 15A circuit run with aluminum wire would need to be #12 and if your conductors are aluminum, you've got bigger concerns than wire size when it comes time to make connections.

ce415442d6934a8dae96b77ac250825faa	Mustard plants are used as a cover crop in vineyards to reduce erosion, add nitrogen and improve soil tilth and water penetration. Cover crops helps to increases organic matter, reduces compaction, reduces excessively vigorous vines, dust and mite problems, & provides a habitat for beneficials.  By providing firm footing during wet weather, the plants allow for winter/early spring access in the vineyard.  <br>  <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3488/is_4_85/ai_n6057253" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3...</a><br>  <br>  Mustard is one of several "cover crops" growing between<br>  rows of grapevines in the Napa Valley, California because:<br>  "Mustard helps to control something called 'nematodes,' which are small worms in the soil that will try to eat the plants." <br>  <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-09/2008-09-10-voa38.cfm?CFID=122473165&CFTOKEN=43570400&jsessionid=de30376a0e8ff0a03caa0323850457941456" rel="nofollow">http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2...</a><br>  <br>  "Studies show that several different Brassicas including Indian mustard (B. juncea) have been tested as green manures for controlling root-knot nematode in vineyards.

8ScFozGuaa	Lots of times when it goes on but on only one level, the control has gone bad.<br>  Black wire form controller to hot side of the plug.( Plug wire will be smooth or have printing on it )<br>  Yellow is the ground to the lamp.<br>  Red from the controller is connected to the neutrals, both from the cord and the line to your sockets.<br>  White from the controller goes to the hot side that runs to your lamp sockets.<br>  The part I'm not sure of is the red and silver that goes to the sockets. They are usually black and white. Not knowing which is the hot or neutral makes for a little more work. I would check to socket itself to see which is which before hooking up the controller, for if not connected properly the controller will fry. I would wire the cord directly to the socket wires to find out. If the lines are reversed you will pop the circuit breaker for the outlet and not fry the controller. My guess is red is hot and silver is neutral.Check which one is now currently connected to the controller device.  I'm still leaning towards the controller needing replacement to regain the low, med, high function.  Good luck.
PRx6j6YQaa	yes and no the shaft has to be the same size and it may or may not fit in the mower itself i put a 12hp BS into a 8 BS and it worked shaft was same size|`|AA10051049	If the 18 hp is for a lawn tractor it will work just fine and should make a good trade.  Just measure the shaft.  The mounting pattern should be the same.  Engines that are made for generators as an example have a tapered shaft.  Not much good for lawn mowers.|`|227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	Yeah go for it!

eZDoQPg8aa	You don't have to "clean" it with the vinegar every time you use it; that would be a total pain.  About once a month is a good rule, but not less than every two months.<br>  <br>  As far as using it, start with cold water in the tank, put a coffee filter in the basket.  Then if you like your coffee fairly robust, put a good heaping 3 tablespoons of finely ground coffee in the paper filter.  Hit the start/brew button and you should be good.  Now it does depend on your coffee and how strong you like it but you might have to adjust the amount of coffee you put in but we use the 3 heaping (and I do mean heaping!) tablespoons.<br>  <br>  Daily maintenance should include a quick wipe of the unit after it's turned off and cooled.  And every so often, give the actual pot and basket a soak in some hot soapy dishwater and a scrub.  Just rinse well and dry or let air dry.  Be sure to wipe down the area where the hot water comes out and goes over the coffee basket.  The water kind of splashes some of the coffee up there and it will get dirty and nasty if you don't keep after it.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	white vinegar. i would use it till the top. they say use one cup per entire coffee filled up but i use the entire thing with vinegar cuase it gets clean better. after it runs with that use one clear water cold and that is all you hve to do you will see depoisits of lime in the water. see it|`|AA10246871	Most coffee machines can simply be cleaned by running a cycle with a mixture of vinegar and water. <br>  <br>  Put a cup of vinegar in the coffee pot, top it off with water, and then run the cycle as if you were making coffee. The vinegar will get rid of built up gunk, including mineral deposits. After you are done doing that, fill the coffee pot with hot water, and run it again. That will get rid of any vinegar taste so your coffee doesn't taste bad the next time you brew a pot.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	The others are right, for sure ... white vinegar.<br>  <br>  No, you don't have to do that every time you use it.

DxbaEPbUaa	unfortunately they will move with you unless you erradicate them all even the eggs! the best thing to do is to get some roach bombs and set them off when you are going out for a while. get some roach gel and put it on small pieces of paper and place the paper throughout the house (behind the stove, under the sinks, in your closets,anywhere where it's dark. get some roach spray and spray outside your entrance doors and in your trash cans. when you get ready to move make sure that you shake all of your belongings out very thoroughly! as you finish packing a box take it out of the apartment asap and move it to the new apartment. this will help to ensure that no roaches travel with you.|`|JR7nf1N7aa	Roaches like the glue from paper bags.

When I moved I threw away A LOT of things.  They love paper based things- boxes, files, etc.  Definitely throw them out.  Small appliances like the blender and coffee maker- take a plastic shopping bag, cover the appliance, tie it up, and place it in your freezer over night.  They love the heat from the electrical wires.  I threw out some rattan type furniture too.  When I got to the new apartment, I unpacked immediately and threw my boxes out, just in case anyone hitched a ride.  Orkin pest control told me that roaches treat corrugated cardboard like a condo.  Additionally, I did go to Lowes and buy some of the gel and placed it in the cracks of furniture, tv, computer, etc.  I lived in the new apartment 2 years and never had any problems.  Best of luck, I remember how disgusted I felt at the time.  You will probably sleep better at the new place.|`|nXzvE0P8aa	Yes, they will move with you. All it takes is for 1 to crawl in you box and it will produce more... You can also call the health department about the problem in the apartment. <br>   I went to visit a family and saw the roaches crawling everywhere and some way 1 or another came home with us and when I least expected I had seen 4 so I called Orkin and they solved the problem. At my families house It was so bad that as they were cooking the roaches were crawling in the oven.  Roaches travel (for example you can take one with you in a Jacket or you bag without even seeing it) and all it takes is on to produce more & more.   Good look because they are realy gross little creatures.|`|CCA0mTgsaa	EVACUATE EVERYTHING IN THAT HOUSE - DO NOT MOVE ANYTHING THAT HAVE LAID THEIR WASTE WILL BE STUCK|`|IFd94XDkaa	They can easily get into your boxes and stuff when you move.

8apA3Rffaa	They can be ( not ideal way to do it), but you asked if it can be done and yes it can be.  You must have the current tile completely clean w/ no dirt and residue on it . You can then apply a pure silicone ( clear or white I d go w/ clear )  and stick the tile/ or listello to  your tile.  You ll have to tape in place until dry so it won t sag and fall off.  I d recommend no less than 24 hrs. Use a painters tape , you know the blue stuff.<br>    Now this is going to leave raw edges showing , so consider you ll have to see them . The raw edges you could  paint, caulk (silicone again but its hard to get a nice clean bead) or use a un sanded grout which will look good and will stick to the edges of the deco /listellos but won t stick good to the glazed surface of the tile.

UMc6uj4Qaa	Coke to begin with is very sticky and needs to removed from the carpet otherwise dirt with stick to it eventually darkening the stain. Laundry detergent is also very sticky unless it is extracted from the carpet. <br>  <br>  If you don't have a carpet cleaning machine to extract the coke you could you use a wet vac, such as, a shop vac. Pour some hot water on the stay and thoroughly extract it. Repeat until it is gone.<br>  <br>  If stain remains then try a tiny bit of laundry detergent and water. Laundry detergent has a ton of wetting agents which are very difficult to rinse from the carpet - it may foam a bunch. the less the better!<br>  <br>  Or hire a professional - good luck!|`|JpiGhUmAaa	DON'T use laundry detergent - press down on the coke with a clean towel to absorb the liquid, then apply a warm wet cloth to the spot.

I would suggest taking advantage of all the new cleaning stuff out there like the Swiffer dusters, mops and cleaning products and the bathroom cleaners that come on a wand or scrubber where you attach a new pad to clean a toilet or shower or tub.  They are a bit pricey, but make cleaning much easier.  When I worked, I cleaned on Thursday night and I sent the family out and when they came home they brought a pizza or something so I didn't have to cook.   That way the weekend was free except the daily pick up that should be done so you never get to the point of feeling so overwhelmed you don't know where to start.  Now, I set one day for cleaning the bathrooms and floors and dusting, etc.,  another day for changing the bedding, and another day for vacuuming.  It doesn't take a lot of time on those days.  If you can, hire someone to do the cleaning.  Keep on top of laundry, have everyone pick up after themselves, and straighten the place up before bed, and don't let dishes stack up in the sink and on the counters.

Which for you, could be a Crayola Purple.  Then, paint the walls a lighter shade (at least 3 or 4 shades lighter).  A purple/lavender bedspread and posters with a lot of purple, neutral rug (so you can change your mind and not have to change carpets, again)<br>  <br>  Have beautiful white porcelain vases with dried lavender flowers, keep lavender in your closet and drawers, and you have a wonderful private sanctuary that is all your own. and the lavender will give you such a happy, calm feeling.<br>  <br>  I wish I had a room just like this, when I was your age.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope you get exactly what you want.<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|wjtH6Bj2aa	Light purple or lime green.<br>  <br>  Dark colors will make your room seem oppressive.

jTmiBk5Oaa	Sounds like hard water, but I've never seen that at my mother's house and she has very hard water.<br>  <br>  Look inside the toilet tank.  if the bowl has deposits as a ring or the tank has a tan deposit, it's hard water.  If you're on a city or county water system, it's doubtful it's hard water.   If you're on a supplied water system, you may call the water department and they can tell you the Ph value of the water and whether this is normal or not.  I don't think it's normal.<br>  <br>  I think you have something in the system that's causing it.  Overly hot water?   Mineral  build up that's flaking off in the pipes?  If it's minerals, it'll be hard and flaky.   It could also be deposits in the pipes that are breaking off.   Could be iron rust.<br>  <br>  Try taking off the aerator and soaking it in hydrogen peroxide.  If you see bubbling, it's mineral deposits.<br>  <br>  On the plus side, mineral water is generally good for you.

TXddP0uxaa	First things first:  if your dog has fleas, you need to get rid of them off of his body so he isn't spreading them all over the house and every where else.  Once this is done, you can get rid of fleas by vacuuming and steam cleaning the upholstery in the car.  Use the vacuum at the car wash so you aren't bringing them into your house in the vacuum bag.  Clean the whole car, seats and floors with a carpet shampooer.  I'd probably do the same thing in your house as well to make sure there isn't any fleas in the house.  The baby's seat should come apart and you can wash the cover.  If not, clean it with the carpet cleaner when you clean the rest of the car.|`|AA12233727	Vacuum very thoroughly.
d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	Depends what you're growing.<br>  <br>  Potatoes  and leeks...start them in the "trenches" and mound up as they grow.  Corn and squash, plant on the "hill".<br>  <br>  Many plants you'll plant the seed directly in the soil.  Others it's better to start the seeds in seeding trays inside, or purchase plants already started when it's time to plant.<br>  <br>  What are you growing?<br>  <br>  For all but the potatoes, I wouldn't even bother making hilly rows.  Just mark out rows on your flat soil.<br>  <br>  For the potatoes, start them early - they don't mind it cooler.  Pile on dirt as they grow, leaving 6-8" of "plant" showing above the soil each time you cover them with more soil.  Although you can start them early - they DON'T like poor drainage - don't plant them in a spot that's wet in spring.  Or - plant in a barrel with drainage.  Put some soil in the bottom - put your potato starts in cover with 4".  Keep adding soil to the barrel as the plants grow.  You'll end up with a barrel full of taters.<br>  <br>  Radishes are fast and easy.  Plant every 3 weeks if you want a continuous supply.  Direct seed them in spring.  <br>  <br>  Tomatoes - but young plants at a garden center around the date of the last frost in your area, and plant them.  If you plant seeds in the ground at that time, you'll be lucky to see a tomato before frost kills them in the fall.  And you can't put them out early, cause frost will kill them.<br>  <br>  Beans - fast and east as well - seed directly in the ground when the soil is warmed, after the last frost date.  Plant them earlier, and they'll just sit there or rot.  Water the spot daily where you sowed the seed, and in a week you'll see plants which will then take off.<br>  <br>  All the above want to be planted in a sunny spot.<br>  <br>  Onions take a few seasons if you're growing from seed, unless you're just looking for the greens.  Faster and easier would be to plant onion "sets" in early spring or late winter...whenever the ground can be worked - or even fall.  You can find onion sets at garden centers in early spring.|`|AA11498082	Cat and Judy are absolutely correct.  *sheesh, what idiot TD'd them*|`|WAktMXaVaa	Generally speaking, you're always safe ON TOP of the rows.

ee01397bfae4bca4cf2787c8c5f214e9aa	The only thing to do is to remove the seat, loosen the staples and remove them, and replace the padding.  I would first check and see how long you have had this chair; if it's less than a year, there may be a warranty on it.  If not, ask an upholsterer to do this for you.  He'll probably charge you $20-40 depending on where you live.

w3lt3JyNaa	You can certainly plant them and see what happens. Most tulips sold in pots in bloom are not good repeaters. Your best bet is is they are in a spot that has good loose rich soil and PERFECT DRAINAGE. Many people forget or don't know that tulips are originally native to Turkey...they can not stand wet feet...they rot...so a raised bed or one on a slope is good. Cold should not be a problem. They do not do well in places that do not give them a winter chill. Plant them, you have nothing to loose and may get a nice surprise next spring :o)|`|Avmolxyqaa	I have planted Valentine tulips which grew and bloomed again.  They did not re-bloom the first year but the second year they did.  Keep taking care of them in the pot they are in until the leaves die back, then plant the bulbs in good well composted and well drained soil, water and leave them alone.  I didn't see anything from mine the next year except some scraggly leaves.  After that they came up and bloomed well.  I had them in a bed with some other perennials and they were watered, mulched and composted along with everything.  I was kinda surprised to see them that 2nd year but there they were!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	You can but they won't come back til next spring not this year most likely.

8apA3Rffaa	Let do this in  order.. Yes it s best is you strip paint to get to concrete, But any one that has tried this will know its an SOB  job and  messy.Next at least scar the paint and rough it up with a good belt sander( coarsest grit) and the remove all the dust w/ mopping several times and or a tack rag , getting the floor just as dust free as possible. Leave no flaking and bubbles in the paint..  Then you can tile w/ a good latex or modified thin set.Since moisture has no where to go ( normally absorbed into cement) , tou must not allow foot traffic for an extra 2/3 days to allow thin set extra drying time. Then grout and seal grout  on a regular time table. Any questions you can e mail me thru my avatar and check my qualifications there  GL|`|e633e8f12f9b39576e9ea6e1617f2cbdaa	i would strip the paint, either with a scraper or power washer, and get a wire bristle brush too. another consideration is whether or not the concrete floor has a moisture problem, and what your climate is like. if its cold, you could consider insulating the floor. i wont go into detail, but it makes it much nicer. ceramic gets cold!|`|w3lt3JyNaa	You need to get thinset to the concrete. The thinset might sorta 'stick' like a plop of it would if it fell from the bucket on some place you dont want it, but for serious tile adhesion you either need to scratch thru some of the paint so the thinset can make contact with the cementous floor beneath or strip the paint w/ some chemical ---<br>  <br>  but I just had a brainstorm. If at all possible, easiest and more 'green' thing to do is rent a powerwasher for a half day....they are excellent at removing paint from concrete and you'll have a fabulously clean floor to proceed and get great adhesion. <br>  <br>  Photos of us laying tile on concrete floor on link below.<br>  best wishes :o)

AA11922229	Time for frig spring cleaning. Someone may have spilled milk. Milk really stinks. Beans really stink too. It may be just one item. <br>  <br>  Yes there is a way to remove slight odors but this is more serious requiring elbow grease. <br>  <br>  Slight odors are removed using baking soda. There are many ways to do this depending on the situation. Some people always keep a box of Armor All Baking Soda in the back shelf of the frig.  More serious smells use a pie plate spread the powder to increase the surface area and keep for a week or more in the frig. Cleaning with a solution of baking soda in water on a wash towel wipe down the interior.<br>  <br>  Baking Soda and Baking Powder are different. Use Soda. <br>  <br>  Is the smell inside or outside?<br>  <br>  Inside: Clean and remove everything.<br>  Outside: Look for spills front and back and in catch tray in back. Move the frig to inspect the floor below. Usually it's nasty. <br>  <br>  Remove everything from the frig, no kidding, you may get very sick. Take off all panels if possible, drawers, shelves, wash in the sink with hot soapy water. That includes the freezer section. Defrost the freezer by unplugging for 5 hours or so. Remove all the ice. Wash everything down with a soapy rag. Use antibacterial dish soap. <br>  <br>  Close the doors for about 20 minutes. Then open them, the frig is room temperature, see if the source is gone. If so, then dry down everything and replace parts, and turn the frig back on.<br>  <br>  After 30 minutes running open the doors and smell. The odor should be gone.<br>  <br>  In the back of the frig is a tray which catches spilled water and milk. Carefully remove and clean. <br>  <br>  Inspect all the food and frozen items in the frig individually. Throw out the old stuff anyway.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	Clean it with bleach and water and then put a box of baking soda in it to absorb future smells.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Clean it out and keep a box of baking soda in there.|`|Y3dFm6uGaa	First, you have to find the source of the odor.  Usually, refrigerators don't smell bad unless they have been turned off for awhile -- then they really stink!<br>  <br>  If your fridge has been running continuously, then I would look for something that has somehow been routed into the defrost channel and has rotted in the pan.<br>  <br>  If you want to save the fridge, I would clean it really good, including the pan under the unit that the defrost water runs into.  Then put baking soda in the fridge.<br>  <br>  I sure hope you get it worked out!|`|831a7af670f2985636729db688219516aa	Have a fridge cleaning party . . .|`|lwnH4Es3aa	put a 1/2 cup of baking soda in a dish and leave in your fridge|`|vpCp2GPVaa	baking soda + sponge + water = your friend.<br>  <br>  Put the shelves in the dishwasher and run a load, and while they're washing...take warm water mixed with baking soda and scrub the inside, then let it dry...<br>  <br>  and keep an open box of baking soda in there.|`|Gwtmvcmlaa	Umm, first check to see if you have anything rotting in there, then use Baking Soda or whatever.

zeTGmB3faa	Remove everything from the cupboards. If the shelving comes out, remove it too. Wipe all areas down with a damp cloth- corners, under shelves. Spray with Raid or other bug killer. Air out overnight and wipe down again. Toss out all open food and start over. Put all cereals, flour, sugar, rice and boxed goods in plastic covered containers or in zip lock bags.  The dog food should be stored in a bin with a tight lid. Once these moths start laying eggs they will get into all food that is not sealed laying there eggs to repeat the cycle. Make sure that even nuts are in a zip lock bag.|`|Avmolxyqaa	Put some mothballs in your pantry and keep those packages sealed up good.<br>  <br>  Using good sealing containers is a must when storing things in your pantry or cabinets for very long.

jSBtdhf0aa	absolutely not i bought 2 of them. they  will not heat an entire house. i built a new home in 2006 and it is well insulated and it will heat one room 15 by 20 in the months of march and april and oct. and part of nov. but on real cold days it takes 2 of them to keep it real warm. and they are hard on the electric bill. they are a very safe heater but that is the only credit i can give them.not being critical just truthful.|`|c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	A point often missed with infra red heaters is that to save monet you should be able to see them. Radiant heat can make you feel comfortable with lower air temperature. Like on a sunny but cool day. The air is too cool for comfort when in the shade but stand in the sun and you feel fine. Infra red heaters are most effective for the same reason.

c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	There are a couple of reasons. First is safety and liability. The janitor is right. Most people do not follow directions for use carefully. Next is cost.

cyEi99Upaa	Painting and carpenting. Those are probably the most important. Once you have your appliances, you won't have to worry about painting around the appliances or getting paint on them.|`|AA11228933	Always painting-unless you like moving stuff around.|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Definitely painting before you get your things in. Depending on what other "maintenance" needs to be done, I might do carpet last. But that's really only if I'd be doing any dirty maintenance and not want to risk it. If you do get carpet first, I'd at least put a tarp down. Seems like something always gets on the carpet when you're into a project. Appliances can come any time because they aren't in the way of anything. But be sure to measure first! I've seen so many people get nice appliances that just BARELY don't fit.

My friend is in the siding, windows and roof business. If you want them to present a quote in WRITING that reflects a "most" payment, do it. If they don't, report them to the BBB. <br>  <br>  The best way to get a siding/window job done is to ask around. Small companies are usually (always) better than big ones like the ones you se on TV.|`|3d87a053602d9d12bfed91079def2db6aa	I didn't know they still had door-to-door salesmen these days and I just wouldn't trust any business that would put that much manpower into a way to drum up business that stopped being cost-effective decades ago.<br>  <br>  I would, if I were you, at least check the Better Business Bureau to find out whether this company has any complaints against it and call a few other window and siding companies (including Sears) in your area to get a feel for what they think of the offer American Exteriors made you. You might, of course, get nothing but negative comments about what these companies would consider their competition, but you just might luck out and get an honest appraisal from one or a couple of them. And, if you're really lucky, you might find someone at one of these companies who is familiar with a come-on similar to this one. I'd also try to get at least a ball-park figure from a few of the companies you call of what they would charge to do the same work.  This would give you some idea as to whether the amount you would be expected to pay American Exteriors would really end up being the bargain they are representing it to be and whether the companies you call use better and/or longer-lasting materials, etc..<br>  <br>  Also, you should ask American Exteriors for the names and numbers of several customers who have had their windows and/or siding replaced by this company and call these people. You could then ask  for their opinions on the quality of the materials and the workmanship they received and whether they had any problems during or after the jobs. (I'd also ask them to provide you with their addresses and emphasize that you just want to drive by and see the new windows/siding from the street. What you really want to do is to take the time to drive by the addresses and determine whether there are really new windows/sidings on the houses and to make sure that the people you are calling are really past customers of American Exteriors and not just someone's relatives who agreed to take calls and give glowing reports on the company.)  <br>  <br>  The final suggestion I would have would be to go the library and see if they have a copy of the magazine, --------------Checkbook, which rates all sorts of companies and services in a particular area. (The ----------- above would be whatever large city is closest to you. The "Washington Checkbook," for example, covers the greater Washington, D.C., area, which includes Northern Virginia and Maryland. The library's reference desk would know whether they have a copy of the  magazine that would help you. This magazine would also be a good place to find companies that might be willing to make honest comments about your American Exteriors and the deal they are offering you. I say that because the companies in the Checkbook magazine series who receive high ratings go out of their ways to keep those good ratings.)<br>  <br>  Even if this company is completely legitimate and is offering you a good deal, it will still be an expensive project for you, so I'd advise you to take your time, ask around, and don't let them pressure you into making a decision until you've done all your research.<br>  <br>  A long-winded response to your short question, but I wish you good luck - :)|`|Uh029jJmaa	Seriously, I've never heard of that. If it's legit, go for it.  It's not like they are asking you to buy all of the stuff, they are covering MOST of the cost.  That's major.

A small woody plant is a SHRUB.<br>  <br>  And golden euonymus is most commonly propagated through softwood cuttings.   Grown from seed it would be a generic euonymus and you could get either green or golden varieties.  To guarantee a duplicate of your golden euonymus it would have to be propagated by cuttings.  Softwood cuttings are easier to work with than hardwood.  Take softwood cuttings about 6 weeks after the plant starts putting out new growth in the spring.  If the new growth is still too soft the cuttings may fail, but just take more a week or two later.  Very easy to propagate.|`|AA11498082	Here is some info for you: <a href="http://www.plantexplorers.com/vandusen/product_info.php/cPath/24/products_id/193" rel="nofollow">http://www.plantexplorers.com/vandusen/p...</a>

Get another professional to survey the work and write you a report. Let the roofer threaten lien and suit all he wants. . . the courts will side with you. Besides the fact that the lien, if he files one, would be moot and easily vacated, a wrongful lien will cost him dearly as the courts really frown on that one.  Liens are useless as most people do not know. The lienor has to file and renew it every year and it only comes into play when and if you sell the house. In alot of states you have to file a notice of commencement prior to starting the job in order to qualify filing a lien; and if your not licensed, bonded and insured you can't anyway. 9 out of 10 liens drop off and never come to fruition due to the fact that scumbags like the one working on your house come and go like the wind.<br>  <br>  Review who I am and you'll see that I'm giving it to you straight.

The shingle protects the felt and holds it down. Ask him to remove the shingles he has already installed, including the old felt. If you have it in a contract then by all means take him to task.

Tell him you had it laying around and that he doesn't need actual money.  The contract doesn't state that you will pay him in US currency.  <br>  <br>  Seriously though, at the very least he has to remove the labor and materials cost for the felt.  That's the least that you should let him get away with.  As the previous poster said, he's the one breaching the contract.  However, if you allow him to finish the roof before you make a stink he will claim that he did put it down and you will have no way to argue it.  <br>  <br>  Provide him with a document that you want him to sign stating that he left the old felt down and that he will remove the labor and materials.

If the cats have owners, talk to them without being confrontational. The cat owner who allows his cat to damage other peoples' property is as guilty as the cat hater who kills the cat for trespassing.

All a heat pump system does is exchanges the heat from the outside to the inside by freon liquid and gas. They are very precise machines and if treated the way you are they will not last long and will not be efficient.

First of all...never listen to you roommate again! And second TAKE THE BOX OFF OF THE UNIT NOW!!!! As for why...happygolucky...had it right...listen to him...not your friend. LOL. As for Ragnarok's comment...he was right in the beginning but then went very wrong. You can run your system as normal...no need for emergency heat. If the coil did freeze over from the box...nothing to worry about. Just so you all know...your coil on your system probably freezes over 2 to 3 times a night on cold nights. But that’s the way your system works...the way the freon flows in the winter causes the outdoor coil to already be cold and added to that cold outdoor temperatures. So what do you get? Frost...the system has a built in mechanism that is called a defrost board and sensor. When the sensor senses the coil is frosting it will basically cut the system into A/C mode to heat the coils up and get rid of the frost. It makes a load whooshing noise...I'm sure you all might have heard before and then makes a strange kind of vibrating noise. So don't worry...I have been on service calls where the defrost board or sensor has gone bad and the outdoor unit is seriously nothing but a white snow ball. It will be fine...just take the box off and run it like normal. Hope this helps...best of luck to your friend...lol.|`|966c91231592132e98c766b9abba712eaa	Do it now.  Yes your roommate is full of it. <br>    <br>  What you have there is a heat pump, and in the <br>  winter the heat cycle is reversed, and the inside <br>  air  handler serves as the condensing coil, and the <br>  outside unit serves as the evaporative coil.<br>  <br>  Blocking the air flow on either coil can cause damage <br>  to the compressor.  <br>    <br>  Yes blocking the outside units airflow will cause the coils <br>  to freeze up, not moving enough heat inside.  Also, <br>  the unit will run longer, and the heat strips will have <br>  to come on, using even more energy.<br>    <br>  added:  For tonight, after you remove the cardboard, <br>  you can switch the thermostat to the emergency <br>  heat position.  You probably already have <br>  begun to ice up the outside unit, and it will <br>  probably ice up more tonight.  Changing the <br>  T-stat to emergency will protect the outside <br>  unit until you can run it tomorrow afternoon, aand <br>  defrost the coils, even the ones you cannot see. <br>    <br>  It is more expensive to operate strip heat than <br>  the heatpump cycle, but by switching over to <br>  emergency heat just for tonight, you improve <br>  your chances of not having to explain to your <br>  landlord that your roommate broke the system.<br>    <br>  In the winter, the system will sometimes reverse <br>  again, so it does cycle warm air across the <br>  outside to defrost the outside coils, but it <br>  should not be covered then either, because <br>  any obstruction to normal airflow can strain <br>  both the compressor and the outside fan motor.<br>    <br>  added2:  I did not go wrong.  You have 20° <br>  ambient temperature.  The kind of ice you can <br>  produce in one day with a blocked airflow <br>  is far more serious than a snowball, plus, even going <br>  against a snowball can cause the outside fan <br>  to fail.  Both the condenser and the fan will<br>  experience shorter life due to the added stress.  <br>  Yes, a defrost cycle does operate as stated, <br>  under normal conditions.  But why strain the system <br>  and shorten the components lives?  Plus, in defrost, <br>  on a cold night you will use more energy using <br>  the heat pump and strips.  In defrost mode, <br>  the heat pump is removing heat from the house, <br>  and the strips run full blast, while fighting the <br>  internal cold air.|`|OwCUYWeUaa	Take the god damn box off the outside unit.

Also if you are reroofing, and it is a really old roof, you want to check it out too for asbestos.. <br>  <br>  You will spend a bit of cash having a company coming and removing it professionaly but atleast you will be able to live longer.. Dont just buy a dust mask and remove it yourself.. And it is considered hazardous so the dump will probably not take it, there is probably a special place you would need to dispose of it.  Knowing it is old and has asbestos and dumping it anyway is a crime and just not good for anyone. Imagine the tractors pushing that around blowing dust all over the place.. gross.. <br>  <br>  Just a thought...
3UB7mSNwaa	Dif works good<br>  <br>  the trick to removing wallpaper is getting the paper saturated with the solution and then scrap it off with a large spackle knife.  It is a messy job the scorer is to penetrate the coating of the paper so that the liquid goes all the way through to the wall.|`|d60e3f88f20f2a43d815c870747bfe65aa	I think you are supposed to score the wallpaper then let the dif soak in.<br>  <br>  I tried removing 40 year old wallpaper with it.  It didn't do anything for me except waste my money.  That stuff is way over priced (and didn't work for me).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muNuzSSzCRU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muNuzSSzC...</a>|`|s5n4Mz1naa	well...its okay. my brother and i were taking wallpaper down in our bathroom a couple of months ago and we used it. What we found worked best was that you should spray it and then let it sit for like 2 minutes. but be careful things get really messy with it.|`|48fkZzzfaa	Just add a little bit of vinegar to your water and let it soak in.

GDKBqwwJaa	It depends on how much you put on it. I would say just to be safe, find the studs in the wall and put them into those. The studs can hold lots of weight. In walls the studs are usually 16 inches or 24 inches apart (left to right).|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	Sure.  All you need to do is weigh the shelf, and guess at how much weight you're going to add.  Go to a Mom & Pop hardware store, NOT HOME DEPOT OR LOWE'S, tell the clerk the weight, and they will advise you.<br>  <br>  Unless it's SUPER heavy, you don't need a stud.
AA12130241	this is what I would do.  First, unplug it and pull it out away from the wall.  Vacuum behind it, and pull off the kick plate below the door and vacuum off the coils.  then let the whole thing sit unplugged for 24 hours.   Sometimes the coils will freeze up and the more it runs and tries to cool, the more iced up it gets.  letting it thaw will allow the coils to once again cool the unit.  If that does not work, then it's time for a professional to have a look.|`|dGRq65eraa	Check to make sure that the condenser coils under the refrigerator are clean and that the freezer and refrigerator door gaskets keeps the doors closed.|`|ngQyJlqaaa	I agree with Paula H about cleaning and defrosting<br>   but you should also check the door seals for wear or damage.<br>   If your fridge is not sealed it will be fighting a losing battle and  eventually burn out the motor

Take the chain to a saw shop and have them grind the chain.|`|1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	Your not sharpening the chain evenly.  The teeth are slanted, as you sharpen them they have less and less bite, If its curving to the left, your right side teeth are longer, file them some more.  The other possibility is the depth gages.  Most people overlook them, they are just in front of each tooth.  If your filing those down too, then you need to file the left ones more.  <br>  <br>  Teeth - opposite side of curve<br>  Depth gage, same side as curve.|`|zM9Lj21waa	when sharpening wouldnt correct that problem on mine , i had to get a new bar...
4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	Medicine bottles aren't the best thing to keep your weed in. What you want to do if you have a gram or more, is put the weed in a  zip-lock baggy, then roll it with all the air being pushed out,t hen get a not zip-lock baggy and put that one over the zip-lock and roll again, then place in a sealed glass jar. Which can be obtained from a thrift store or even Wal-Mart, for a dollar.<br>  <br>  As for it becoming white, I do not know? I never heard of this. The keif (spell-check) is white, crystals, and it's always better to have bud that is super-crystallized, because this is what really gets you high. Although that bud is usually known as "White-Widow" which is already white when purchased or grown. But bud is always ok to smoke, the more dried out and old it is, the less of a high you will get from it, but it is never dangerous to smoke. I have found blunts under my bed that were almost a year old and still smoked it, it was like smoking Red-Bud was the only problem, but it still took in minor effect.<br>  <br>  Why haven't you smoked it by now anyways? You say it's two large nugs, even if it were two small nugs, they should no longer be there. Nobody should have that much bud just stashed away getting old, that means your no real stoner. That sh*t should have been sold or smoked by now. Even given away, because if you let it get to old it would be a shame to see something so beautiful be reduced to ugly...|`|DTlFaJkaaa	clean the medicine bottle first, and if it's moldy, get rid of it, you'll get sicker than FK smokin that.|`|mI4lrKdHaa	If it is too moist it could be mould. If you think it might be bad just pony express it to me. Smoke it before you make a poor decision in your life.........cheers|`|XTqpWDXPaa	It's probably mold and I wouldn't recommend smoking it.  But it should be safe to smoke the parts without mold on them (like the inside of the bud).  If you get fresh buds that are still moist I would leave them in a baggie for a few days to dry out a little before you would put them in your bottle.  Also its little known but, if you are going to have your sac for a while you can keep it fresh in the freezer, but make sure its dry and in an airtight container.

UGCFi2j4aa	What I find works best is...<br>  <br>  Buy a bale or so of straw, probably 7-10 bucks from the feed store.  Open it up and sprinkle it out on the hill until no dirt is showing through.. Then sprinkle the grass seed out over the straw.. If it is going to rain the week or two after you spread seed, then I would wait till you have clear weather. Otherwise the water will wash the seed away.  The straw helps protect the seed from some water, the wind, birds, etc... and most of all it helps keep it moist which is better for the new grass and seed.  You don't want to over water but you dont want it drying out too much either.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you out a bit.|`|WAktMXaVaa	In addition to the Lincoln Paintball answer which is GREAT, I would terrace the slope with railroad ties or landscaping stones.

72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	I would avoid Whirlpool and any of their products like the plague!  They have nice appliances, but if they break down, I cantell you form PERSONAL experience, they STINK!  And because of that, I will never buy another one of their appliances!  The fully automatic washing machines, sound great, but think of how many times you have left something in the pocket, imagine it now going straight into the drying cycle with that pen, lipstick and so on, now all nice and mingled and stains set with heat in the drying cycle!  I don't know about you, but not everything I put in the wash needs to be dried in the dryer.  Lots of my clothes are removed from the washer (where I find one the girls tubes of lip gloss OPENED and now on my white top!) and either hung to dry, or hung outside.  I like not using extra energy if I can.  And I like fresh air dried sheets and towels.  I especially like having the options to decide.  If you never do any of these things, then a fully automatic machine would make sense.  The double door fridges do use a great deal more energy (the tests are done with the doors closed and not how you would ACTUALLY use the machines in real life.  Power consumption on ALL appliances can vary brand to brand, style to style, always check the label and be aware of some of the fudge factors companies are using. Consumer Reports has been asking for these to be changed to reflect how consumers are actually using the machines and also for testing by third parties to verify info as many companies are down right lying and  fudging their figures as all are presently self reported. There is presently no testing being required to posting ANY of their claims!  My dryer is a Kenmore and is has a moisture sensor, I set mine for slightly dry.  It gets dry enough that by the time I fold them or hang them, they are perfectly dry and not all static clinging to me.  Hope this help you!  Good luck!|`|l8yfpyy1aa	I suspect you're in a different country from me (I'm in the USA).  Here, we would look up appliance discussions and ratings in "Consumer Reports" or some other consumer magazine.      Generally, washing machines and dryers are separate appliances.  A fully automatic washing machine would be one where you load in the clothes, add detergent, and start the hot water running in.  Cycle times vary, depending on which one you specify when you start the washer.  The machine goes through a wash cycle, a spin cycle, one or two rinse cycles, and a final spin cycle all by itself.  Then you take out the clothes and put them in the clothes dryer.  You can hang the more delicate things up to dry at this point, or take the sheets and pillow cases out to hang on a clothes line.  In our household, two washer loads equal three dryer loads, so I usually wash two loads before starting the dryer.  It seems to turn out better when I wash a mixed load of heavy towels and lighter sheets and garments, but dry only heavy items together and light items together.  Our dryer has a cycle which senses when the clothes are dry.  It then progresses to a cycle which tumbles the clothes every few minutes so they don't wrinkle if I can't get to them right away.    The most modern washing machines are expensive front-loaders.  Both of our daughters have purchased such machines, and say they do a very good job and wash a large load at a time.  However, the clothes are locked in there for the whole cycle.  We have a standard Maytag agitator-type top loader, and it does a good job for us.    The most convenient type of refrigerator/freezer is the kind with two vertical doors.  They are really worth it, even though they use more power than the kind with the refrigerator below and the freezer section above.  Whatever you do, get the self-defrosting kind (I don't know if they even sell the kind you have to defrost yourself any longer).     Some come with automatic ice-makers, but I have always thought those take up too much valuable space compared with ice cube trays.  Also you have to worry about connecting them to a water supply.  I'd always pick more capacity over fancy features in a refrigerator/freezer, myself.

CuMYdQV6aa	Achillea millefolium, otherwise known as yarrow, is found widely throughout Colorado on roadside and on dryish stony ground. I'm sorry I can't be more precise but, in my own defence, I live in England. The plant is also found right across Europe and much of Asia.    It gets its name Achillea of course because legend has it that it was used to staunch the wound on Achilles' heel after the Battle of Troy. It failed. He died.    As you probably know, there is a particularly attractive form of yarrow called "Colorado".

AA10665464	Hello and excellent question!    First, you have made a wise choice in building a raised bed (soil box).  When your soil is rocky or poor quality, a raised bed can make the difference between disappointment and a nice harvest.    How deep your soil needs to be kind of depends on what you plan to grow, and how much soil you actually have underneath that you can use -- the rocky part is the problem.  In general, 12 inches is the least I would go for a great harvest.  If you can build your bed even deeper, your beggies will thank you for it.  :)    As long as you've cleared out the weeds and removed some of the rocks, you don't need to line your raised bed box.  In fact, you can start by mixing what soil you do have with compost, to make your poor soil a bit better.    Personally for the raised beds I grow, I like mostly compost -- bagged is fine.  I will also usually add in some (don't laugh) potting soil to make the soil a bit more porous; easier for new roots to grow.  I just mix it all up.    Once you've planted your veggies, don't forget to mulch them well.  I like hay (the cheaper the better) the best, but you can use bark chips, newspaper or plastic garden mulch.    Best of luck with your garden!|`|a2ce1097a86fb1054145f9a23192a355aa	Really all you need to do is to create a raised bed for your plants.  It doesn't have to be framed in and it will be a lot less work for you if you don't frame it in.      If you must have a box, of course you would not want to put a bottom in it.  The water your plants need must be able to drain out  or you would risk drowning your plants.  No, you don't need to line it with bark or anything.  You're overthinking this project.    Just a low pile of good soil with some compost worked into it will make a nice garden for you.  Six inches deep is plenty.   You don't need to get different types of soil and layer it.  Again, that is overthinking what should be a really simple project.    Here's how to make a raised bed:  http://freeplants.com/preparing-raised-p...|`|ak3YySQgaa	Hi!

AA10051049	I am going to take a guess here.  When it was moved it got tipped too far and oil got from the crankcase into the air filter area.  There is a vent tube that runs from the crankcase into the air box.  Check your air filter for oil.  Check the level of oil in the crankcase also.  If there is oil on the air filter replace it.  Add oil to the crankcase to bring it to the full mark.  Wipe any oil from the air box.  I would remove the spark plug and clean it.  I would than put a teaspoon of gas into the spark plug hole, replace the plug and start it up.  It may smoke for a bit but it should clear up.  Once it is running, tell your brother in law what a good deal you got on the washer and where you bought it.  Maybe he will go get his own.|`|8ea4731a729b705912f2536fb0cd0430aa	Check the spark plug. pull it out and make sure to pull the pull start a couple times to get extra build up out of the piston then put the plug back in. You should hold open the sprayer when you try to start it and that will reduce compression on the motor and be easier to start. You may need to set the choke if it has a choke lever on it.|`|3yzpx3HSaa	change the spark plug|`|kSyiUxYSaa	"Gunked it up".....explain that then we can better help you.
