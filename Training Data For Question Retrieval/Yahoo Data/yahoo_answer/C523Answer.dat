Unfortunately for them, I believe that at conception there was a genetic problem and they may have developed characteristics at odds with their true sexuality.  A lot of these people are assisted with the use of hormones and operations that help them adjust to the identity they wish.  It is always hard decision to wait until the person is an adult to make a choice, or to have some intervention for them as a child.  I think we all need to be more understanding of the problems these people have to face.  People who think they should have been born animals is a totally different problem; I think they need intervention of a psychiatric nature.
brSfRLspaa	the first time I would recommend just shaving the "undercarriage" around your lips and butt(you've probably never looked but most people have atleast a few hairs there, especially guys = klingons = skidmarks = puke), since that's the most important area hygeine and dryness wise plus you almost never get irritation there. If you are going to get irritation it's going to be on the main upper triangle part so hold of on that or just trim it for now. After you get used to the undercarriage then go for the upper area but it's trickier and it's a good idea to use conditioner on your pubes before and a gel type deodorant on the upper area right after you shave it to prevent razorburn.<br>  <br>  you cannot wax yourself, not even bikini line, so don't even try, there's nothing wrong with shaving.<br>  <br>  oh yeah, shaving gels are better than foams, and twin blade disposables are the best sice you get a fresh blade everytime, that's the most important thing, n that goes for your legs and everywhere|`|TUVI7FLlaa	WAX is the best <br>  <br>  how to do it : buy a bottle of wax and use teaspoon to get a little wax on your hand and just rub it till it is ready then just pluck with it your hair down there with small amounts very painful but it is worth it you will feel like a new person<br>  <br>  dont listen to people above me they are just lazy and shave if you want a good result and hair not to grow for a while then wax<br>  <br>  PS: no pain no gain|`|wH9vd6bCaa	Nair is rubbish I agree, it is best to trim first with some scissors then shave it off it does take ages though just start at the leg area and work your way through, or you could just go for a bikini wax for a quicker option . hope this helps x|`|WuxsTx1taa	Well, i shave, and literally started a month ago.<br>  Its great, the redness and itching went away,<br>  and i shave every 2nd day.<br>  its easy and CHEAP!<br>  <br>  :)|`|xl05ITIJaa	Bikini waxing...<br>  I haven't tried it, but it's going to be pretty uncomfortable since it's in your most sensitive region.<br>  I just trim it with like, scissors, and then shave it down.<br>  Although sometimes it gets itchy (oops).<br>  <br>  I'm sure bikini waxing is a worthwhile investment, but I haven't gotten brave enough to go yet.|`|hBmafVYoaa	Waxing can be done at home but the best thing to do is go to a salon in your area.

I would strongly suggest that you either get him into therapy, or leave him altogether. Allowing him to continue this behavior toward you will justify his reasons for doing it; you need to show him that that kind of behavior will not be tolerated by you.<br>  If he ever struck out at you, you should immediately contact law enforcement, as well as document any visible signs of abuse. Take pictures of any bruises and the like. It's common for abusive behavior in a relationship to escalate as the relationship continues. Personally, I would stop things even before they escalated to how they are now. You yourself even stated you hate how you're being treated. Don't let it continue any longer.|`|5963a9dcd16252920459b1eefffbb993aa	don't waste your time and go away from him. otherwise you will be a looser.|`|ZKqSo4pdaa	Old habit dies hard.

hBmafVYoaa	You can go to a normal GP, if they think it could be something else they will refer you to a gynacologist. For thrush the doctor will ask you questions. I have never been examined for a yeast infection, so I doubt you will be.|`|MhpccWpmaa	Yes, the doctor will give you a vaginal exam and probably take some cultures not only for your STD testing but to send out for the yeast infection as well to be sure that it's what you have.  If you wanted to, you could go to your GP for all of this, while they do not specialize in this areas as Gyno's do, they do do all of the tests and such and can still properly diagnose you.  However, I think that going to a gyno is a good idea just because of the fact that they specialize in these sorts of things and will probably have a lot better answers for any questions that you may have. As for being embarrassed-try not to be.  Remember that gyno's see vagina's all day, every day for a living.  There's nothing they haven't seen.  Just try to relax|`|RhPNV1ohaa	go to the GP they can take care of this and do so routinely.

Filling it with as hot of water as you can tolerate but not so hot that it burns you.

One or two days treatment is normally required to get over most yeast infections.|`|wH9vd6bCaa	Hiya, you just go to the gp, if your really embarrassed you can just go to the chemist and buy canestan that works pretty well but then again its just as embarrassing to buy it, your gp will have loads of women coming in with thrush i have it twice in 3 years its just one of those things, and they don't test you for stds they don't even look at you down there don't worry.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	yes the doctor will have to have  a look down there to check you out.

AA11485284	It's very common for women and girls to experience increased acne before their period. The increased exercise leads to increase in sweating, as well. That in combination with the rampant hormones in your system prior to your period can result in increase in acne. I suggest washing your face more often, use acne treating washes (like Clearasil) regularly. You should also considering altering your diet if you're eating an excess of fast foods and greasy, fatty meals.|`|rVsnBLfdaa	Yes it is your period, when l  was younger my three brothers use to always be able to tell when l was about to get my periods because suddenly l would breakout, l never got pimples any other time.

Try doing this every day and night.   It's also great for premenstrual tension.|`|ZCAnfK3Taa	yes this is naturel i got alot of them to when i started its commen for girls to break out around the time of their period don't worry check out this site it might help i didn't read the whole thing but it looks interesting   <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.health24.com/medical/Condition_centres/777-792-796-1529,15720.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.health24.com/medical/Conditio...</a>|`|hBmafVYoaa	I think it most likely is to do with your periods.

RCJqaWQYaa	1.Apply cool tea bags, an ice cube wrapped in soft cloth, or cucumber slices to your eyes daily. The tannin in tea bags has been shown to reduce swelling and discoloration, and cucumber slices have long been used to reduce puffiness and refresh the appearance of skin around the eyes. Lie down, preferably in the morning, and leave fresh cucumber slices or cool, damp caffeinated tea bags (you can refrigerate them overnight so they’ll be ready) over your eyes for about 10-15 minutes. Keep your eyes closed<br>  <br>  2.Avoid rubbing your eyes. Usually rubbing of the eyes is brought on by allergies, but not always. Regardless of the reason, stop doing it. The rubbing irritates the skin and can break tiny capillaries beneath the skin, causing both puffiness and discoloration. <br>  <br>  Try drinking two glasses of cranberry juice a day, you will need to do this for at least a week before you start noticing a difference.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ZtY9xWzyaa	One of the best ways to get rid of dark under eye circles is to use a good eye cream. It has to contain lots of vitamins and natural ingredients so it can effectively treat the saggy skin. Try a Kinerase cream with peptides.

Not saying this might be why you have dark circles but maybe if you are concerned next time you go to the doctors ask for a thyroid test  (TSH/T4).

vIw47BEFaa	I know of only yoga.  Techniques are developed by teachers naming it with various names.  Kriya means the act of doing work or activities and Shakthi means power.  See this link for Kriya Yoga<br>  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriya_Yoga.  Pranic healing focus on healing by control over thr prana (the life force).  It is close to Reikhi in its methods.  There is nothing which you can achieve from these which cannot be achieved through Yoga.

wwP3ONCFaa	Eat a light snack before bedtime. Bread and fruit will do nicely an hour or two before you hit the hay, So will a glass of warm milk. Avoid sugary snacks that can excite your system or heavy meals that can stress your body.<br>  <br>  Take a hike. Get some exercise late in the afternoon or early in the evening,It shouldn't be too strenuous—a walk around the block will do just fine. Not only will it fatigue your muscles, but it will raise your body temperature. When that begins to fall, it may help induce sleepiness. Exercise also may help trigger the deep, nourishing sleep that the body craves the most for replenishment.<br>  <br>  Take a warm bath. One theory held by sleep experts has it that normal body temperatures play off the body's circadian rhythm. Those temperatures are low during sleep and at their highest point during the day.<br>  <br>  Along those lines, it's thought that the body begins to get drowsy as its temperature drops. Therefore, a warm bath taken about 4 or 5 hours before bedtime will raise that temperature. Then, as it begins to fall, you'll feel more tired, which will make it easier to fall asleep.|`|vZBgdA0eaa	haha you're 15. You have no job to worry about....no wife....no kids to feed.

5oNwMqMiaa	Hi hun,<br>  They're ok if you're burning them off, but to be honest, they are quite high in carbs.<br>  If you want to stay trim/lose a bit more then I would reach for a healthier snack. <br>  Dried or fresh fruit, veg sticks and hummus, ryevita with low fat soft cheese and cucumber or a handful of unsalted nuts are all good alternatives.  Plus you can generally eat more of them for the same amount of calories as a processed snack.<br>  If you're trying to beat the bloat as well, remember to drink at least 2-3 litres of water a day, especially if you're exercising.  If you drink less than required, your body will hold on to what little it has - increasing your bloat!  Drink herbal/fruit and green teas to flush your system through and try starting the day with hot water and a little lemon.<br>  The other thing you can try are water balance tablets available from Boots, Superdrug etc.  My friend swears by them to get rid of excess water retention around her period.<br>  Good luck hun, you will get there :-)|`|096b7gBHaa	as long as it is snacks, there's nothing much healthy about it, unless if  to include unhealthy ingredients alongside the healthy ones.

LEmeQ0Kjaa	Your problem could be one of two things.<br>  <br>  First, you could simply be depressed. I know it's the cliche answer but that could be what is happening. When you are depressed and don't notice or acknowledge it, the feeling can overwhelm your thoughts and get into your mentality without you realizing it's happening. The reason depression is so difficult for some people to overcome is because you have to reverse the way your brain has started to think; you have to consciously fight against the typical negativity and pessimism of repeated thoughts in your mind telling you everything is dull, meaningless, and pointless.<br>  <br>  The second possibility is that you are subconsciously exhausted/dissatisfied by the world around you. Considering we live in a mass consumer culture where everything looks the same, life is about luxury and appearances all the time, and our friends sometimes seem to have the same superficial/stupid conversations day after day, it's no wonder that a thinking, curious human being would grow bored of the same unfulfilling life. Yet because our culture/world likes to assimilate everyone into the same mindset/lifestyle, you might feel like there is something wrong with YOU for wanting a change, rather than seeing the society AROUND you as the inadequate thing. You need to get away, try something completely different, like a new group of friends or a weekend in the countryside or a class in something you know nothing about - like drawing or painting - because if you continue to live the same life that's boring you, nothing's going to change.|`|yJRXcPQ4aa	Sounds like somebody needs a cuddle!|`|PcyAHXKbaa	Read "a new earth" by Eckhart Tolle. if anticipate being bored you always will be...|`|v3bhi62Kaa	Maybe your going through a funky face ya know where everything seems to suck your get bored of life and stuff.

Your OB/GYN may not be educated on Lupus so talk with your Rheumatologist about it BEFORE you get the depo shot as this birth control cannot be taken out of the body once it is administered.<br>  <br>  As far as your initial question goes with cortisone, you should be o.k.  My wife gets cortisone shots in her knees to help with the necrosis of her femur.|`|XK0kZ8Iiaa	Personally I love cortisone shots. LOL!  They usually take away the pain temporarily and give you a lot of energy for a day or 2.  A one time shot will not cause those problems you are talking about.  It may also help some with the swelling and definitely the breathing as it is an anti-inflammatory. Good luck!

pqnEavSyaa	Do you have flat feet? The most common cause of arch pain is Plantar Fasciitis. Plantar Fasciitis involves inflammation of the Plantar Fascia - the fibrous band of tissue that connects the heel bone to the toes. Someone with arch pain usually has inflammation of the tissues within the mid-foot. <br>  <br>  Plantar Fasciitis is caused by over-stretching of the Plantar Fascia. Repeated strain can cause tiny tears in the ligament. These can lead to inflammation, irritation, pain and swelling. Arch pain is more likely to happen when:<br>  <br>  -- the feet roll inward too much (over-pronation)  <br>  -- walking, standing, or running for long periods of time, especially on hard surfaces  <br>  -- excess weight  <br>  -- tight Achilles tendons and/or calf muscles<br>  <br>  Medical studies on foot pain found that a combination of stretching exercises and wearing a standard, off-the-shelf orthotic shoe insert is the most effective way of dealing with arch pain.  This treatment regime is also very effective for the treatment of heel pain.<br>  <br>  For more information, please read link below.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	you may be having a problem with cramping in the muscles of your foot.  this could be caused by low potassium.  try eating more baked or boiled potatoes and/or bananas

UrrpXJvWaa	Hi !<br>  <br>  Losing weight and buring fat go hand in hand.  Please check out this site to learn how to lose weight for good <a href="http://NOFAT.easyurl.net" rel="nofollow">http://NOFAT.easyurl.net</a> .<br>  <br>  Just remember that building muscle and losing weight are not mutually exclusive!|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Determine your daily calorie intake . Losing weight is simply a matter of expending more calories than you take in, through exercise and your daily activities. To win the battle, it helps to know how many calories you are consuming in a day. <br>  <br>  Write down all the things you eat on a typical day. Carry a small notebook with you and write down every snack, every drink, and the contents of every meal. There are also great websites that you can use to keep track of calories, get recipes, and help achieve your goal. Don't forget to include the pats of butter or the spoonful of sugar in your coffee. It's best to do this for at least a couple weekdays and a weekend; it's even better if you can go a full week. There are also calorie tracking websites that can help you to do this, for example the US government website, My Pyramid Tracker. <br>  Do an itemized calorie count. When possible, write down the number of calories in each thing you eat as you eat it. Keep in mind that the recommende<br>  d serving size is often considerably smaller than the serving you actually eat. Look up the calorie count on the internet for foods that don't have calories listed on the container or for fast food meals. You don't have to be 100% accurate, but you do want a good estimate of the number of calories you're taking in. There is an idea that multiplying your own weight by ten will produce a rough estimate of the number of calories you need to eat per day to maintain your weight. This is NOT true, you may wind up grossly under (or perhaps over) estimating the number of calories you should be eating. Use a scientific or health website to determine the number of calories you should eat a day or consult your doctor. Everyone has different metabolisms and there is no blanket rule that covers everyone's recommended calorie intake. Reducing 500 calories per day from the calories you eat to maintain your weight can help you lose a pound of fat per week.<br>  <br>  <br>  [2] <br>  Go over the list and decide which foods to cut out or reduce. Cutting calories is usually a lot easier than you might think. For example, that daily tall latte in the morning may pack 500 calories. Since a pound of flab (lost or gained) is roughly equivalent to 3,500 calories, replacing that rich beverage with black coffee can help you lose a pound a week. Other easy cuts include salad dressing (salad dressing is the number one source of fat in the average American woman's diet) soda pop, candy, and butter. Look at the nutritional information for the foods you eat, pay special attention to your intake of saturated fats and empty calories (high-sugar foods). You don't need to cut these things out entirely, but if you reduce your intake of high-fat, high-calorie foods you'll lose weight faster. <br>  Seek out alternatives to the unhealthy foods you've identified. You can simply reduce the amount of soda you drink or mayonnaise you put on your sandwiches, or you can substitute healthier choices. Drink water instead of soda, for example, or use mustard instead of mayo. Low-fat and low-calorie options are also available for most foods, and many of these are natural, (although some are made with strange chemicals), and tasty. Start trying to eat healthy in most meals:<br>  <br>  <br>  Choose lean meats. Chicken and fish are both very low in fat (and certain fish like salmon, sardines, and fresh tuna are an excellent source of antioxidants, which are also beneficial to your health), so aim to replace some or all of the beef or pork in your diet with these foods. <br>  Replace high-calorie side dishes with healthier alternatives. Many people get a ton of calories from side dishes such as macaroni and cheese, French fries, or potato salad. You can eat healthier and lose weight by replacing these with fresh vegetables and salads. Pre-made salads are practically effortless, and when accompanied by a reduced-calorie dressing or no dressing at all, they're weight-loss gold. <br>  Start your days off right. A fattening breakfast of bacon and eggs or a pastry can be replaced with yogurt, oatmeal, high-fiber, low-sugar cereals; or fresh fruit for fruit smoothies. However, for those on a low carb diet bacon and eggs are a great combo for breakfast, since neither have carbs. But don't fall into the trap of skipping breakfast. Eating a healthy breakfast increases your rest metabolic rate earlier in the day, and reduces snacking before lunch. <br>  Plan your meals. Look for healthy, delicious meals online or in your cookbooks, and create a menu for the week. Make sure that your meal plan reduces your total calorie intake: you're not going to lose weight if you consume the same amount of calories by eating different foods. Make a list of what you'll need for these meals, and -- except for a few snacks, of course -- don't stray from your list when you get to the market. Planning your meals helps ensure you get a balanced diet and reduces the temptation to stop off for fast food or order a pizza. Remember, it's easier to stick to your|`|eWEqGHvJaa	Try to eat after drinking a glass of water that will help you feel full faster and keep you from overeating.

Sorry to hear that. what you could start with before anything else is a positive attitude. Without that, you wont be motivated to do anything. If u cant find one roday. Then find one for the future.

Anyway enough preaching.<br>  <br>  To get back in shape and lose the excess weight, u first need to cut down or give up alchohol. Alchohol provides calories that do not fall in the carbs, protein or fat category which prompts the body to utilize it before any resource. this slows down ur body metabolism. So after drinking even if u eat less compared what u shud, u will put on weight as ur body now requires less energy to survive, and that energy is not obtained from any vital resources. To feel full and satisfied, yet not over eat, u gotta do it the smart way.<br>  <br>  Drink 2 glasses of water when u wake up as this rehydrates the body and cleans ur system. eat a good healthy breakfast. Eggs, cereal, fuits instead of fruit juice. Avoid red meat as much as u can. Eat light, but eat every 3 hours. This will improve the body metabolism. Drink a glass of water before every meal. That helps fill u up so u dont feel hungry. The hunger hormone ghrelin takes about 15-20 minutes after eating to send impulses to ur brain saying that ur stomach is full. So take ur time eating ur meals. Drink water as u eat. Try substituting juice with natural fruits instead. They contain less sugar. Remember excess sugar in the body gets converted in lipids which are nothing else but fatty acids converting to fat. Most of the digestive reactions in the body take place in water, so make sure u drink at least 8 12oz glasses of water a day.<br>  <br>  dont worry, its not as hard or difficult as it looks. I have had clients loose as much as 8lbs in their first week by following this diet and regular workout. I dont see any reason why u shudnt. <br>  If you need additional help, check out my websites<br>  <br>  www.thebettermeds.com  for dietary supplements<br>  or <br>  www.sdevkumar.qhealthzone.com  for fitness tips and products.<br>  <br>  Feel free to contact me on sunil86in@hotmail.com|`|HE23qtamaa	First of all, I think there might be some emotional element to your eating and your need to feel full. It's a difficult thing, and something many people struggle with.<br>  <br>  The easiest thing to do is cut the carbs. That way, you can still eat often, and feel full, but lose weight. It's so difficult at first, but it really works. Instead of a sandwich - just take the ham/other lunch meat, and make a little wrap with a piece of cheese and tomato. Soup is good, but no rice, pasta or potato. Become a friend with salads, and put lots of stuff in them, like meats, cheese, veggies etc. Have stir-fries without rice and make a quesh without the pastry. Try having eggs for breakfast (like omelettes etc) without any bread. You'll feel really full and stay full longer. Get rid of the rice cakes, they will just make you feel hungrier. Snack on things like nuts and cheese, and fruits and veggies. <br>  <br>  Other than that, get rid of the drinking. And by that, I mean drinking juice - it's just full of sugar! At least, if you are going to drink, have some chilled vodka or a glass of wine. <br>  <br>  Besides the eating, you need to see someone about your issues - it really helps to talk to a professional. Many community centers have free psychology services. Ask your doctor.<br>  <br>  Remember, food won't make you happy - it's only creating a vicious cycle, which you need to break now.|`|IpPDumlgaa	Hun, I'm sorry, but your drinking is going to contribute to weight gain. Alcohol is horrible for the liver (and many other things), making it secrete fat, and, long story short, the body absorbes less nutrients, and a person gets what is often called a 'beer belly'. They don't call it that for no reason.<br>  Also, often people consume more calories than they think they might, ecause of juices, such as Orange juice. It's still a food, and it's not necessarily as hydrating as it could be. <br>  I know what you mean by still feeling the need to eat. That, is often because of dehydration. I would strongly suggest that you consider having less of the other drinks (if not excluding alcohol), and drinking a lot more water. When people drink more water, they generally feel less of a need to eat more, because a lot of the times when your body feels hungry, it's actually thursty, and it's trying to hydrate itself by getting you to eat, and getting any water content from the food. The body's a smart thing, but deceptive at the same time. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying that you absolutely have to exersize, but you may want to consider going for little walks. Especially if you start to feel hungry right after you eat. I find that walking tends to get the mind off of food, it sort of prevents bordom eating, and it counteracts some of the eating, as well. <br>  <br>  If you want to get into nutrition.. well, I won't bug you with that, because there are PLENTY of resources; such as even a basic food guild.<br>  Basically, try to include more vegetables, lean proteins, and a bit of fat.<br>  <br>  E-mail me for more information.<br>  Best of luck!
1070916be865ee45ad7eb6aaebfaa743aa	Strangely enough I got a similar pain recently from sit-ups. It's more like a dull pressure that I can feel when I lay or move a certain way. I think it's overexertion -- I've started running 2 miles, doing crunches, pushups, and arm curls with free weights... all cold turkey. If you don't ease back into doing sit-ups after a period of no activity then your muscles that aren't used too often can get strained. When you're doing a crunchy motion you are using your back as well as your abs, so it makes sense.|`|aNwWauXzaa	Get stronger traps.|`|6YlHOiGHaa	maybe try a machine a sit upmachine.i used to do free sit ups but i read that they can hurt your back even when youre doing it right. so i just use the machines now

uFRIsdC7aa	How did I get MRSA?<br>  Anyone can get MRSA. You can get MRSA by touching someone or something that has the bacteria on it and then touching your skin or your nose. <br>  Some ways that you could get MRSA: <br>  Touching the infected skin of someone who has MRSA <br>  Using personal items of someone who has MRSA, such astowels, wash cloths, clothes or athletic equipment <br>  Touching objects, such as public phones or door knobs, that have MRSA bacteria on the surface and then touching your nose or an open sore, paper cut, etc. <br>  <a href="http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/mrsa/book.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc...</a>|`|b9uOax0aaa	Yes.|`|hLosmqqGaa	Handwashing is an effective way to reduce the spread of infections, so it's probably less likely to pick it up off of the tub than other surfaces.<br>  <br>  However, the tub is a wet environment, it would be a good idea to rinse the shower if the last person to bathe was infected with MRSA, just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  Alcohol is an approved disinfectant to control MRSA, but it evaporates quickly. You especially want to be cautious if immunocompromised individuals will be sharing washroom facilities with a MRSA patient. Children, the elderly, AIDS patients, and people with certain other conditions (e.g. taking steroid treatments, Down Syndrome, etc.) should not be exposed to MRSA if at all possible... but again, transfer in an environment where you're cleaning yourself is not all that likely.|`|wbSGa7m8aa	Yes, but you can also get infected with MRSA by numerous other means. Alcohol has no effect upon the strains of MRSA that are found in many of the states of the USA. This is a fast-evolving bacterium that has left behind today's modern antibiotics.<br>  <br>  MRSA medical is the best site to visit for all your concerns and questions about MRSA. This is a real site, run by a caring and genuine person, who has untold knowledge about MRSA and associated infections.<br>  <br>  This would probably be the best link for your concerns:<br>  <a href="http://www.mrsamedical.com/mrsaprevention.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrsamedical.com/mrsapreventio...</a>|`|4KCaSuAlaa	yes|`|c89d6971b68010f6683d6e2b1920cc43aa	yes|`|H39nT287aa	A lot of people are colonised with MRSA, but they do not actually get the infection. Alcohol gel will not make a difference. You may or may not get the infection, it depends on whether MRSA is able to get into your body. If you are worried you should go see a doctor. They might give you antibacterial cream or antibiotics, IF they think you are at risk of getting MRSA. See the the site in source, it's really helpful.

If you're still curious and want to do it i would recommend that you make sure you are with people you can trust not to try and mess with your head. A bad trip can be brought about by people thinking it's fun to try and freak you out. You're very suggestible, almost gullible, on acid, so be wary. It can be the best or worst of experiences, frame of mind is all important. Come down can be very uncomfortable physically, but equally the euphoric feeling when coming up can be excellent. If you have the slightest doubt about it, don't do it, that's my advice.

kdSuwt8paa	Poor you.   It sounds miserable - the sort of thing to curl up in bed and sleep, have hot honey and lemon drinks, aspirin for your fever etc.  As it has gone on so long the doctor might give you antibiotics - especially if it has gone to your chest (sounds as if it has) but I think it is complications of a cold rather than something very serious.
AA11423609	Try the deer exercise (google it). This helps for the ejaculation. Also, when masturbating, right before you squirt, stop jerking and sqeeze so you don't shoot out, then once your need to release semen goes away, start again and stop before you squirt and keep doing the same thing. It hurts to stop before you squirt and it will take alot of control to stop when you want to squirt, but keep at it. This helps to train your system to last longer, so the ejaculation period increases. There is a technique called jelqing for your penis to increase in length and girth, but I wouldn't do it if I were you coz it breaks your penis wall cells so they can heal as longer cells and your penis will increase. But this can cause your penis to become crooked or maybe even smaller! Also keep in mind that it doesn't matter how big your penis is on a flop, but it's the erecction that counts and also how you perform. To have a harder erection, also tense your anuss for a continuous period, as though you are drawing water up it, and this helps to increase strength. The more you practice, the longer you'll be able to hold it. Do it daily, when you're eating, watching TV etc... Good luck! P.S- Consult a doctor, most importantly!!|`|da6a0a5ba9a378f9610464f17e4891fbaa	no it soes not...low sperm counts can be dut to frequent masturbation or low prodcution by the testicles|`|8b3668d19e31088bc29e9f6289da8362aa	Well, I'm not exactly sure what you are asking, but it sounds as though you are asking if during ejaculation the "pumping" muscles in your penis should be pumping furiously enough to make your penis bob up and down.  If you are talking about that, then you do not have to worry about a low sperm count.  What you have to worry about is if your penis can put enough pressure behind the sperm to push them into the right location of the vagina.  Just ask check to see if when you ejaculate, your semen, within the first 2 or 3 "squirts" shoots at least 1 inch from the end of your penis.  If it does, you are pretty much OK, and will get a woman pregnant.  If not, you will need to see a doctor.  The problem is probably easily corrected.  A low sperm count can only be determined through medical examination.  There is no easily seen body function to indicate a low sperm count.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|25de09082cba88f877e05dcc702b2b81aa	you'll go blind.

66e5b9c3e64731757891167fb2eb833faa	Fases de la respuesta sexual <br>  Existen 3 fases en la respuesta sexual: el deseo, la excitación y el orgasmo <br>  <br>  El deseo sexual se origina en una parte especial del cerebro que controla las emociones. Durante la infancia esta zona y sus conexiones estén muy poco activas. Durante la pubertad aumenta la producción de las hormonas llamadas andrógenos (mensajeros químicos) en hombres y mujeres, las que activan los centros sexuales en el cerebro y de esta forma las personas son capaces de sentir deseo sexual.<br>  El pene es el órgano masculino especialmente sensible a la estimulación sexual. La punta del pene se llama glande y es la zona más sensible del pene. El glande esta cubierto por piel, que se llama prepucio, y que se retrae durante el coito. Durante la excitación sexual las venas se llenan de sangre a presión y esto hace que se produzca la erección y se ponga duro, lo que permite que el pene pueda penetrar la vagina. Además produce un líquido pegajoso que ayuda a humedecer, llamado líquido preseminal, en el que hay espermios, aunque en menor cantidad que los que hay en el semen. En el momento del orgasmo se producen peque?as contracciones en el pene y los testículos que son placenteras. También se produce la eyaculación o salida del semen. <br>  El hombre también orina por el pene, pero la orina y el semen nunca pasan al mismo tiempo, pues existe una válvula que cierra el conducto (llamado uretra) cuando el hombre va a orinar o a eyacular.<br>  <a href="http://www.infojoven.cl/2-4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.infojoven.cl/2-4.php</a>|`|257070287441810e9047bfef7939f0c7aa	Pregúntale a un sexologo(a)|`|37fb2e677936051b904036eb2a4dafd9aa	ES EL SUBCONCIENTE PERVERSO DE MUCHOS HOMBRES!!!!<br>  <br>  HUYYYYYYYY.|`|3c29bc18f2f304c82b4ca19855807a70aa	no es otra vena yo queria saber eso mismo y lo averigue la cosa es que es el mismo roto en las mujeres no. y el placer sale del cerebro|`|Vu9woBBLaa	Es simple, eso es cerebral.<br>  <br>  Todo el cuerpo es receptor envía sus mensajes de eventos al cerbero y estos los hace reaccionar e interpreta esta con un impulso.<br>  <br>  El placer es un impulso que te da orgánicamente la respuesta de que esta bien lo que haces , en tu ejemplo : responde al instinto básico de la procreación , eyaculando estas dando entregando tu material genético.

View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.|`|Wf5k8kYQaa	What you have to do is get used to the bodily sensations, like heart beating fast and brething heavy. those are things that can trigger a panic attack becasue you fear that you are going to get one since you cant control you bodily sensations. When you get dizzy or anything you have to have someone talk through it with you saying things like "See its only your mind spinning nothing is gong to happen and so on"<br>  Therapy is a great help for that|`|NW1oQMtGaa	Perhaps,do not stress much your self every day and learn to relax always.Perhaps,that could minimize it.|`|ZmikGFTEaa	Try doing meditation in your free time and try not to think or focus on things or aspects that make you feel uneasy..<br>  change your aspect on life, on seeing and judging various things..<br>  hope it helps!<br>  Good luck!|`|bc998ecd84fbc0adf3d9154f2683ff7daa	Relaxation therapy really helps !|`|Bdu0hZcsaa	Hello. I used to have panic attacks, they started at 17.  I was terrified and i didnt know what was wrong, neither did my doctors, i thought i was going crazy, it was terrifying. However i eventually found out that it was attacks.  I saw a psychologist, got cognitive therapy (the best therapy), and i am fine now, i am no longer afraid of them if they happen. They ALWAYS pass, and no matter how awful they feel, they do. But its best if you can get some sort of therapy if you are anxious the whole time. Loads of people feel exactly as you do...they just may not say it.. i found out about 1 in 4 people have had similiar expereinces and its not weird. There is loads of support out there. Try and tell your parents and get to a doctor who will recommend the best help. You will be fine, Good luck.

qBEOAF0Uaa	prozacs sh*t unless your depressed of course.|`|dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  (ANS) The problem is that Prozac is rather habit forming but also having said this its VERY very important that you take the drug as prescribed i.e. stick to the regularity of the dose. <br>  <br>  Why? prozac is prescribed for a purpose and if you suddenly stop taking the treatment YES! 100% certainly you will have acute & chronic withdrawl effects as you have already indicated (not very pleasant as you can see!). Suddely stopping the treatment is very unkind to yourself and its a shock to both your physical body and your brain (body-mind).<br>  <br>  NOTE:- To come off Prozac it should be done VERY gradually and very slowly over many weeks & months & this should be done in consideration of how long you have been taking this drug. The longer its been taken the slower & longer the come off duration should be. The dose should be reduced little by little and at the same time other forms of emotional support should be given as a safety net such as counseling or therapy on a weekly basis if possible.<br>  <br>  Take care kind regards Ivan<br>  <br>  ex MIND charity worker.|`|87b6887f8f3651f24e111ac966c0f89daa	These could indeed be side effects, especially if you are at school the side effects are heavier with those under 18. Just make sure that you have had enough sleep and water to remove sleep deprivation and dehydration. It's really important that you take your prozac on time as they can take up to 8 weeks to work again, withdrawal is always suppose to be gradual so coming off suddenly usually has some effects but once you start again you should be alright.<br>  <br>  I think it's unwise to follow the aboves advice and come off it without discussing this with your doctor. If you struggle with taking your medication on time maybe you could create and alarm that reminds you to take them,|`|URZeQfQCaa	It's a common side effect, it usually wears off fairly quickly. From experience, you are better off without it. The longer you take Prozac, the harder it is to come off it.|`|JUhxb6RPaa	It sounds like it yea, you've got to take them regularly at the same time every day usually in the morning otherwise you'll mess up their effects.|`|Y0DugutZaa	hey i think try to get back into routine again, if that does not work after 4 weeks see your doctor and maybe change the meds, there are lots of types and each works for different people differently, I had to go through about 4 or 5 different meds before i found one that was okay and as you know how long it can take to have them working it can be a hassle but is worth it in the end. hope you get it managed. good luck.<br>  oh and it could be drug related i have also had a week where things just werent going to plan and i forgot for a few days or got mixed u and took an extra pill cos i forgot i had taken already and yes it can have an effect i also got headache and also anxiety, so think just try to wait it out and as said get back into routine.|`|SLph9RX6aa	prozac builds up in your system, when you first start taking it, it takes about two weeks to start working, therefore if you mix up your doses every once in a while it shouldn't make any difference. if you are feeling a bit low, it may be because of your missed dose, just get back to regular and you should be fine. prozac is meant to be easy to come off especially if you are on a 20mg dose, it shouldn't cause these withdrawals, maybe you are very sensitive.<br>  prozac is a useful tool for depression but if you cant remember to take it correctly it might not be for you.

It's a great way to lose weight and keep it off because you are losing weight in a healthy way. Fad diets promote quick weight loss but quick is not necessarily good. Dropping 5-10 pounds in a week and a half is unhealthy though. I think it is unrealistic to lose that much weight in such a short time, especially if you are already thin because it will take longer to lose even more since you are closer to your body's natural set point.|`|81G7JUd3aa	iceberg lettuce with oil and vinegar only, no salad dressing..... plain rice cakes for dessert.. and only water to drink... don't drink too much water as that will add a lot of water weight... if you get hungary just sleep if you can.

Mental Condition myass!!  Sounds like she is just mucked up and doesn't care about anyone but herself.

Has high expectations? Lack of empathy? Severely unhappy? Hates holidays? Doesn't get what she asks for? Feels unvalued?<br>  The only thing I can tell is that she has poor manners, is rude, and that she doesn't care about people's feelings enough as she should, at least for the holidays (because you didn't make a mention of this behaviour in other situations, I'm assuming she's a generally nice person?)..<br>  Perhaps you should bring this up to her (in a nice way-- if she makes a negative comment, ask if something bigger is bothering her and if there's something you can do?) because it's the first step of going about changing her behavior.

2LwrGcReaa	It depends on your technique and where you carry most of your weight.  If you hold your hands toward your weight, you will press more than if you hold your hands toward your shoulders.  However, this will also affect the leverage that you have, so it may not directly affect how hard you're working.<br>  <br>  If you carry more weight around your waist or legs, you will press less weight than if you carry more around your chest and shoulders.  This is why woman can hold chest presses much longer than men--they carry more weight around there legs and waist, while men carry more weight in their chest.  When it comes to actually doing push-ups (as opposed to holding a chest press), however, men usually win because more chest muscle mass means more endurance.<br>  <br>  In all cases, however, the amount of weight you press will be at least 25% less than your actual weight, but the variables are too many to give you a more accurate answer.  Best way to figure it out is to do a push up on with one hand on a scale (the other hand should be on a book of the same thickness to be even), then double the weight that you see.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|401a43d20d27cf9619c3fb7230e0e472aa	Between 50% and 65% depending on how you do it.

This means that your body thinks that your pancreas is a "foreign invader", and tries to kill it.  WHY this happens is not fully understood.<br>  <br>  Type 2 Diabetes is a disease caused by a poor lifestyle, primarily by being overweight.  It is most common in adults who still eat like they did when they were teenagers, but do not get enough exercise.  This causes them to become overweight, which is the major cause of Diabetes .<br>  <br>  Unfortuantly, many young children are becoming Type 2 Diabetics becaus they sta inside, eat snacks, and play video games instead of going outside to play soccer, basketball, tennes, ride a bike, or swim.  Type 2 Diabetes is now being found in children as young as 9 years old!<br>  <br>  In Type 1 Diabetes , the ONLY treatment is to take insulin shots.  There is NO CURE for Diabetes , and patient must take insulin shots for the rest of thier lives.<br>  <br>  For Type 2 Diabetes there is NO CURE, but patients can prevent or control the disease by adopting a healthy lifestye.  That means to take STRICT control of their diet (no sugars - colas, energy drinks, sports drinks, processed fruit juices, canned fruits, candies, cakes, cookies,. pies, jellies, or jams), eat fewer starches (breads, crackers, pastas, rice, corn, potaotes), eat more fibers (whole grain breads, Cheerios, leafy green vegetables),  Type 2 diabetics MUST get more exercies!<br>  <br>  By getting more exercise and eating less food, the Type 2 Diabetic will lose weight.  the Type 2 Diabetic must keep his/her weight in the "normal" range for their height.<br>  <br>  Type 2 Diabetes also has a strong genetic component.  People whose father or mother or grandparents had Type 2 Diabetes are more likely to get Diabetes .  If someone in your family has Diabetes , then YOU need to take extra special care to control your diet, exercies, and weight so that you do not get it, too.|`|AA11707965	When the Pancreas quits making enough insulin.

Just tell him that your periods have gone mad and when he asks how just say exactly what you said here.    No real period but a fairly constant discharge varying from clear to dark and some pain.    There are endless possibilities here.    He will probably do some tests before he can give you the answer.    Good luck!    And don't be embarrassed.

It could be a miscarrage or light bleeding can occur when your first pregnant.|`|ZkL1CcGoaa	thicker, sometimes more musky smelling discharge is usually a sign that your ovulating, or of infection. It is very likely that your cycle is off and your body dropped and egg when it was not supposed or dropped more than one at a time. When your body is preparing for ovulation your uterine lining to builds up just in case the egg would be fertilized. If fertilization doesnt occur the lining sloughs off, giving u bleeding, small pieces of bloody tissue, and sometimes clots. As for bleeding during sex if a man goes hard enough, or enters you from an odd position it is very possible to cause bleeding similar to what you described, but if the blood is darker in color that means that the blood has been present awhile and you are in the end of your cycle. The Pelvic pain is also explained by the random ovulation. If you are not on a birth control method I recommend that you do so.<br>  <br>  Another possible explanation is that you are pregnant, most women experience light bleeding during their first trimester and the week of and after your period is when you are expected to ovulate and it is very possible for you to get pregnant at that time. <br>  <br>  Your going to be fine no matter what just go to the doctor and explain that your having breakthrough bleeding and the severity of it and he can reccomend the best ways of fixing the issue, many doctors are used to hearing the strange and awkward.....thats why their professionals
XK0kZ8Iiaa	I dont know how you can be normocytic Normochromic with an increased hemoglobin and hematocrit.  Those both refer to an anemia which is with low H&H.  I have a high H&H and I have polycythemia.  With a high H&H, I just go have blood drawn off a couple times a week until it is normal again.  And no mine does not lead to anyting else unless I dont have it fixed.  A low H&H(normocytic normochromic) anemia can be caused from several things.  So I would want to find the cause where maybe it could be easily fixed.

qq5nceCXaa	From Ben Goldacre the science correspondent in the Guardian, bit of a hot topic again as some idiot on the radio was bad mouthing the MMR jab based on zero real facts.<br>  <br>  The figures show a clear link between the drop in cases of all three illnesses and the introduction of a vaccine, with another drop linked to the introduction of MMR due to the increased herd immunity.  It then shows a rise in Measles cases as that herd immunity has been lost due to the reduction in the numbers having the vaccine.  There's also been a mumps outbreak in 2005.<br>  <br>  There has been no repeated study that shows any link between the vaccine and harmful outcomes, whereas at least 2 children in the UK have dies from Measles in the last couple of years.  It's sad as there's a typical middle class view that it's OK if your kids are strong and healthy to catch these childhood illnesses.  For most people it is, but for some it's fatal.  It also excludes anyone with a weakened immune system (say a childhood leukemia patient) as they cannot freely mix with a population that does not have herd immunity.<br>  <br>  Whilst I do feel for those who's children develop autism, the fact is that no study has supported a link, and the original Wakefield study that created most of the scare neither supported the findings of a link nor withstood a study of the methodology employed to suggest that the autism had arisen after the injections were given.<br>  <br>  I know you didn't ask for the extra detail, but it is important to put the statistics in context.
NPpalf1Gaa	Teeth will not just straighten themselves out on their own. Infact, over the years your teeth will start to shift and move out of place even more. You don't have to get visible braces, there's always alternatives you can ask your dentist about. However, if you are younger and not yet an adult braces are probably what he or she is going to recommend for you.<br>  My best advice, go ahead and get the braces now! You will be glad you did it in the future when your smile is perfect and straight and you won't be self conscious about anything. Not only will you feel confident in your smile. Also, if your teeth alignment is off (which mostly only dentist professionals can tell you if they are or not,) then in the future you may have joint problems and it may hurt to eat and open/close your mouth. People think braces don't make a difference, but they really do. They are hard work, you have to care for your teeth directly as they tell you to do, but if you do this all the work pays off in the end.<br>  Another reason to get them now is because I don't want you ending up like me, being a freshman in college and STILL having them on because I got them a little later than most. There's nothing wrong with this, but ideally teenagers will have them off by their senior year in high school. I was not so lucky.. infact that was when I got mine on:[ <br>  <br>  And your friends saying this is a case of vanity.. do not listen to them. This is a decision regarding benefit to your health that could dramatically effect your future for years to come.. vanity is not even an issue.. you and your health are.

pzLDXL6gaa	It can take longer than 2 sugar pills to get your period, especially in the first month. For some women it normally takes 3-4 days to get their period and I've heard it's quite common for it to be longer the first month, even up to 5-6 days. So you will probably get it this week, unless you think there's any reason why you wouldn't (e.g. you had sex before you were fully protected)<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|7XIWtNr6aa	It takes a little while for your body to adjust to being regulated by the pill.

No worries!|`|mNGUbaoDaa	Normally it can take up to 3 months before your body gets used to the pills,so it will be a while before your period is predictable and starts right on time.

8OeAPuzwaa	There are 3 kinds of anorexia.<br>  <br>  1) Dolly magazine readers, who do it for attention, or look at celebs starving themselves and say, "WOW!!  SHE'S AMAZING!" *drool*<br>  <br>  2) Abuse-related - this is attention seeking in a different way, because they've been given the wrong sort of attention, or none at all.<br>  <br>  3) It can be hereditary.  That means genetic, in which case it practically is a disease.  It's like depression and bipolar - if there's a history, there's more chance of you having it.|`|jaGU3zyyaa	It can be caused by poor self-esteem, usually from real or imagined criticism from family members or peers.|`|bN6EYhvxaa	i think genetics have a factor to play in the illness also|`|3jFm0rWdaa	It's a psychological problem with physical manifestations.<br>  It's also similar to OCD, because they are OBSESSING on food and their weight - with absolutely not control or brakes on their actions.<br>  They can die from it, usually from a painful heart attack.  It's no joke and a very serious mental illness to have.
hEH9pWABaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  I wasn't really sure what factors elicit acne formation, so I did a little research and found you the best answer. It's not my answer, and while I'll be taking credit for someone elses work, I'm merely doing this to give YOU what you want, which is a sincere and authentic answer, free from any false statements and... well... bullshit. Here it is:<br>  <br>  Acne is due to over activity and plugging of the oil glands. The main underlying cause of acne is increased levels of hormones during adolescence. Acne is not caused by diet. A person who has acne does not have to avoid eating fried foods, chocolates, or any other food. <br>  Acne is not caused by sexual activity. It is not caused by dirt nor by not washing the face often enough. The tops of blackheads are black because of the chemical reaction of the oil plug with the air. Acne usually lasts until the age of 20 or sometimes 25. It is rare for acne to leave any scars, and people worry needlessly about this.<br>  <br>  Care of acne <br>  <br>  Good skin care can keep acne under control and at a mild level. <br>  Wash the skin twice a day using a mild soap, especially after exercise. Avoid scrubbing the skin. Hard scrubbing of the skin is harmful because it irritates the openings of the oil glands and can cause them to be more tightly closed. <br>  Avoid putting any oily or greasy substances on the face. Oily and greasy substances make acne worse by blocking oil glands. If unavoidable, use water-based cover-up cosmetics, and wash them off at bedtime. <br>  Shampoo the hair daily. Avoid hair tonics or hair creams especially greasy ones. These substances spread to the face and aggravate the acne. <br>  Avoid picking blackheads as this delays healing. In general, it is better not to "pop" pimples. <br>  Exercise regularly and keep fit. <br>  Don't stop the acne medicine too soon. It may take up to 8 weeks for a good response.|`|tE2Wl42Baa	I've heard it is not so much the chocolate that causes it, but the sugar and milk in *milk* and *white* chocolate that can aggravate the acne in some cases, by causing a rush in blood sugar levels, and also the milk can contain hormones that also aggravate it. Having a diet low in sugar and hormons from animal products is a definite help. I've found dark chocolate [70% cocoa solids] do not have a bad effect, as there is much less sugar, and they usually contain no milk. Dark chocolate is also great for your blood vessels and has antioxidants in!:D enjoy it!|`|AcY9JgJsaa	It has been said that diet contributes to acne, yet I'm not too sure about that.  Chocolate does not cause acne though, and dark chocolate is actually good for you in moderation as it has antioxidants.  I say no but if you breakout with chocolate it may be your trigger food, though I am a chocolate addict and wouldn't give it up! Haha.  Yet I just purchased a product called AcneMD that has an all natural pill that you take and it allows you to eat whatever you want, or so it says.  Either way it seems to be helping me.  But don't go out and buy this product just because I did, and I say this because I just got it a few days ago and need to see its final result.  So I say no enjoy you chocolate, I know I do! :~) Hope this helps, though its just my opinion.|`|8466ee3d8aec016c639737d732471435aa	There is a huge debate if food has anything to do with your complexion. Most say no it's hygiene and hormones -<br>  <br>  However we are what we eat ? So the healthier you are <br>  the better you are - ?<br>  <br>  I would never say don't eat chocolate. Everything in moderation is key to life.

qLkMSEBwaa	I haven't, but I did have other problems after having my son.  My pregnancy was a miracle to begin with because I have a medical condition that prevents me from conceiving..the Dr.'s still say, I just got lucky..and my pregnancy was very high risk.<br>  <br>  BUT, it sounds like a hernia or a cyst...DO NOT WORRY regardless of what it is.

But, I know people who had rare forms of cancer and wasn't given more than 2 months to live and they lived on many years in remission, 1 man over 20 years.  <br>  <br>  I also know of many, including my own mom, who worried herself into a 2nd massive heart attack, when the Dr.'s couldn't believe she survived the 1st one and had a history of diabetes, high blood pressure, and had been having heart attacks as early as her 30's.  <br>  <br>  She sadly died at 46, 3 yrs after our evil dad was killed in self-defense by my 17 yr old brother in front of me when I was 10 to save us all.  Being that I honestly believe our evil dad died and went to hell and took over and is the devil himself...No wonder her heart was so weak...He was the most evil SOB to ever walk on earth!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I'm NOT telling you this for any other reason except to hopefully assure you that worrying will ONLY make it worse no matter what it is.  I've seen POSITIVE outcomes from people who DID NOT let worry consume them and survived very real and rare medical conditions.<br>  <br>  I also have cheated death and severe medical/personal problems that should have taken me out or at least kept me down...and I am a worrier, But..I am also a fighter!!!!!

EwmHsEoiaa	There is no point to circumcision- that is why there exists controversy.<br>  <br>  Maybe it would be helpful if you learnt the history of circumcision.<br>  <br>  Circumcision was originally done 1000's of years ago as a rite of passage.  They did it at puberty - it was painful and was supposed to make you into a man.  Jews and Muslims copied these ancient tribes that did this.<br>  <br>  Today , only 20% of the world's men are circumcised.  Most of these are Muslim.<br>  <br>  Non-religious circumcision began in the late 1800's to stop boys from masturbating among other silly reasons.  This only happened in English speaking countries.  Most countries have never circumcised.  Circumcision was never that popular in Britain and had died out by 1950.  Today less than 1% of British boys are circumcised.  In Canada and Australia it died out in the 1970's.  Today less than 10% of boys are circumcised in these 2 countries.  The USA is the only place it is really done.  Though the rate has declined recently to about 55%.  You can see a full history here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=5&id=70&Itemid=48" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/ind...</a> <br>  <br>  There are no medical reasons to circumcise.  Though a lot of the old myths still persuade new parents to perform this damaging operation.  You can see the replies to the myths here:<br>  <a href="http://pharmtips.com/2008/11/27/dispelling-myths-about-circumcision/" rel="nofollow">http://pharmtips.com/2008/11/27/dispelli...</a><br>  <br>  An intact boy requires no care in infancy.  With an intact boy, all you need to know is do not pull the foreskin back or try to clean under it.  This incorrect advice is often given by inexperienced doctors.  This is why some boys have to get it done later.  If parents follow the correct advice - do nothing - then like in other countries that do not circumcise, it never has to be done later.  The foreskin is attached to the glans (head of penis, underneath the foreskin) at birth.  It should be left to separate naturally.  Once separated, the boy can pull the foreskin back.  This separation usually occurs from the ages of 0-10 , though it can occur in puberty.  Until it becomes retractable - there is no care.  After it becomes retractable then there is no danger - just tell your boy to wash under it in the shower like any other body part.  It takes 2 seconds.  here is full guidelines:<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin is an important part of the penis.  It contains many nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  the glans dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin also has a role in sex.  Women and men enjoy sex more when the man still  has his foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>  <br>  On this page you can hear from men who dislike being circumcised.  They are angry for having their right to bodily integrity violated:<br>  <a href="http://stopthecut.org/blog/" rel="nofollow">http://stopthecut.org/blog/</a>|`|rLsphyqhaa	I was never cut however, I do know of two that I was a witness to. One was a guy I knew when on active duty. He was in his early 20's and he had it done. We had to put him out on leave for about two weeks until he healed up and he could come back to work. He said it was pain full but he dealt with it. They other was our middle son, he was not cut at birth and we felt he did not need it both our boys are like that. Well the middle one began to speak out about some discomfort and we then found out that his foreskin was not retracting. We did not pull it back a little each time he had a bath. thus it did not stretch any. Here he is a 5 year old and had to then have it done. It was painful and he had to spend the night in the hospital. We in fact took him back a few days later because it was bleeding more than what it should have ot that is what we thought. But it has healed up just fine. Now our youngest has not had any trouble. We told him and showed him what to do. <br>   As young parents we had no idea that we was to pull the skin back on little boys until they can to it them self. I think that it is sort of or would be look at as child abuse when they are little. Also later in life that they learn early on to pull the skin back that they then will learn to masturbate sooner than most. Boys are going to any way more so than girls but it just helps it along some.|`|IulXRMV4aa	sry but you sound pretty stupid lol. Almost all people are circumsized at birth so you don't remember the pain and there is no pain for the rest of your life. Yes it is ok to be circumsized, many health benefits, cleaner, reduced risk of infections/diseases. Many retarded people say that it is unneccesary but that is entirely false. Circumsision is the way to go.|`|5HOMRUeMaa	Most have it done without their consent at birth.  No, it is not okay that I am circumcised, but I had nothing to say about it and it is not reversible, which is why it should be outlawed.  They don't allow it to be done on girls, there should be some equality here.|`|qzpQdJ44aa	Most boys are circumcised when they are still infant and are unlikely to recall any incident about pain etc.  <br>  <br>  No it's not okay to be circumcised.|`|mjDdy67Jaa	yes it's ok for me.<br>  i was circumcised at birth, so i cant remember anything.<br>  but my mom said she put alcohol after, lol that would really be painful|`|EiX4L2xQaa	well most boys are circumcised when they are just a baby like right after they are born so we have no remembrance of it at all|`|3gPLONagaa	I'm not circumcised and I don't wanna try it|`|5VqfLJcmaa	How old are you and who is the person responsible for asking you to do this project.?It sounds like a very odd thing to ask girls to do. Anyway, you can see from the answers here that some people are very anti circumcision and like to repeat rants they have seen elsewhere and to cite information that is 50 to 100 years out of date<br>  I am circumcised and I requested it as a 26 year old medical student and I am very glad that I did. I had learned of the many health benefits and it was basically a personal choice. I was not having any foreskin problems. <br>  The only thing that bothered me was that it was embarrassing to have people making wisecracks about it. It was not painful except when I got nocturnal erections. The healing was a breeze and the stitches were out in a week. I had no need to take any pain killers.Sex is better.<br>  I would recommend it to every male and I feel that infancy is the best time.<br>  In the world  fight against AIDs male circumcision is well-known to cut the incidence of acquiring AIDs in circumcised by 60 percent. That is one compelling reason to lose that skin. If you are over 18 you are free to join a pro circumcision group and learn the benefits of this beneficial procedure|`|9KeaTUh6aa	It is very rare for adult men to be circumcised. Most circumcisions occur during the neonatal period as it is safest and is not remembered. To answer your questions, then:<br>  1. It was fine, I guess. There are rarely medical complications and I have not had any.<br>  2. I am not sure how long the pain lasts as I can't remember it. Humans don't have incident memories from the neonatal period.<br>  3. It is perfectly acceptable for a male to be circumcised. Though the tradition is mostly religious (about 70% of all circumcised males are Muslim, and almost all Jewish men are circumcised), there are a few benefits like improved sexual function and somewhat reduced risk of HPV and penile cancer.|`|OTiLeig8aa	I was circumcised a few days after birth and my circumcision went well, I have a really cool looking penis.<br>  <br>  My circumcision hurt really bad, I couldn't walk for 9 or 10 months after!|`|TsjqzanQaa	Because I was circumcised shortly after birth, I don't remember being tied down, assaulted, sexually molested and mutilated by that process called circumcision.<br>  <br>  It resulted in more than the usual (50-75%) loss of sexual sensitivity in my case, which ruined my sex life.        After years I found out about foreskin restoration, and this has vastly improved my sexual sensitivity and ability, as well as enormously increasing the intensity of orgasms.<br>  <br>  <br>  The pain, especially the psychological pain from the mutilation lasts a lifetime.<br>  <br>  Doctors never disclose the adverse effections and complications that can and do result from male genital mutilation, called circumcision.<br>  <br>  Doctors make money from circumcisions, and very frequently are members of the religions that try to mutilate all males with circumcision.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, circumcision makes males more susceptible to HIV and other diseases.     The foreskin containes Langerhans cells, which have antiviral and antibacterial properties.      This is a relatively new<br>  discovery, and shows why the USA at the height of the HIV epidemic had the highest rate of HIV transmission of any industrialized country, much higher than the countries in Europe, South America, Asia, Scandinavia where males are rarely mutilated by circumcision.<br>  <br>  Pakistan, for example, has an HIV rate 400% more than that of their neighbors in India, where the vast majority of men are uncircumcised.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|E64juLwJaa	Was done at age 23 :my own request<br>  A;l went well<br>  Was active in sex after 3 weeks again.<br>  No regrets what so ever.<br>  Planets.|`|K4zsztkRaa	My circumcision was horrible, I was strapped to a table and cut up without pain medication and without my permission.<br>  <br>  The pain lasts for a week or two as an infant and about a week for an adult.<br>  <br>  And no it's not okay. This should be illegal and banned. NO one has the right to force their religion or their beliefs on another person without their permission.

AA11423609	I just watched an episode of "Grey's Anatomy" and this guy, after having sex, couldn't get his erection down and it turned out that he had a tumour growing along his spine that was affecting the nerves associated with erections, thus making it impossible for him to become flaccid. They had to operate to remove the tumour and he was fine. I'm not saying that you necessarily have a tumour, everything could be 100% fine and you might be really lucky, but I think you should go to the doctor anyway. You can never be too sure right!

Mine is eliptical bike, 7pm.<br>  I "Don't think, just do" all the way there, and once I'm there, I just get plugged in and go.    <br>  <br>  Mission completed, and my brain was never involved to argue against it!|`|ESy7tUsnaa	Doing what you are good at daily and especially when you dont feel like doing anything.|`|WkubMvB9aa	Turn off the TV.  Listen to some fast music on your ipod or something and just start small, go for a brisk walk instead of sitting around.  Then each week walk a little longer, or maybe walk twice a day.   <br>  <br>  Nutrition is also important, "garbage in, garbage out" is how I think about it.  Also, being dehydrated causes fatigue, so drinking more water may help.<br>  <br>  You may not actually feel like exercising until you've been doing it for a few weeks...it gets easier, and actually quite appealing the more you do.  Good luck.
AA11378861	Each time you have an abortion you are running the risk of not being able to maintain pregnancy in the future or even get pregnant again ,the inside of your uterus is scraped out and vacuumed,   with each procedure your are running the risk of complications of  surgery, infection, blood clots and even death. If you read the fine print on the consent it will list complications, that's for any surgery. My niece just had a hysterectomy because of complications of too many professional abortions  so now she'll never have kids. I'm not being negative or trying to scare you but I think women need to know the facts. Call the health dept and talk to an RN they are always available to talk to you without bias opinions. I wish you the best.|`|2ffa28d27ac1a948a50fd3a54761f43eaa	Don't risk, if you ever want a baby don't even think that way. There are plenty of other posible ways to protect yourself of pregnancy. Please go to your doctor and have real good conversation about the thing. Abortion is not "protection" of pregnancy, condom is, pills are, and there are other things.... <br>  <br>  Please be wise, after that kind of steps in your life you couldn't be ever be the same person, and all the regrets that you might have afterwards in your life...just don't risk! Regards!|`|3pt1hJqeaa	One abortion is already considered high risk in a woman.|`|lNjlSer9aa	There is no minimum or maximum number of abortions that a woman can have, that "guarantees" that she will not have health problems... It only takes one...<br>  <br>  Use condoms.|`|mINzRNotaa	Use a condom|`|AA11008660	Depends on the woman.. the type of abortion performed (some have higher risk of complications)..the doctor who performs the abortion.. whether infection occured after the procedure etc... So, to answer your question, I do not believe there is a definitive number that can be applied here.  Sorry to give you such a wishy-washy answer but it does totally depend on the woman and the doctor...

Is it the same type of pain you got when you had braces? If it is, then it's perfectly normal, it's just trying to make your teeth not move, to retain the teeht. However, you said the pain was not normal. If it's a sharper pain where it affects your nerves, then you need to go to see your ortho and talk about it with your ortho. I had a similar situation, but it wasn't the type of pain that felt tight, but the type where it hurt my nerves. So I suggest you see your ortho if the pain is not like the pain when you had braces.|`|LvRxdGGFaa	The bottom ones always bothered me the most. If it doesn't get better in a few days, call your orthodontist and schedule an appointment.|`|vlhAFwjLaa	Yes its normal and very painful.. especially on the bottom... i had braces years ago an then top an bottom retainer afterwards.. and my bottom hurt so bad, made my teeth feel so soft an delicate... but yes its very normal... but i stopeed wearing my bottom after a while because of the pain, but kept my top one in.. an yeah dont make that mistake.. my bottom teeth are not as straight as my top now.. it was a bad idea.. just deal with the pain.. it will be worth it...
bmq7tlpZaa	I just had my gallbladder removed Feb 8th, 2008 for Biliary Dyskinesia, and I had exactly the same symptoms that you are having. Have you noticed anymore bowel changes such as diarrhea or constipation? Any nausea, vomiting, or pain after eating?<br>  <br>  Most likely your doctor will order blood work to check your liver function and also an ultrasound to check for gallstones and structural abnormalities within the gallbladder. Don't be discouraged if it does not show anything, because quite often you can have gallbladder disease without stones(such as my case).<br>  <br>  If the ultrasound doesn't show anything, you can request that a HIDA scan with CCK be performed. This is an x-ray that will measure how your gallbladder empties. It takes one to 2 hours to perform. You will lay on a table, flat on your back with a large x-ray machine over your tummy, and an I. V. needle in your arm/hand or where ever they decide to place it.<br>  <br>  At some point during the x-ray, the technician will inject CCK(a naturally occurring chemical within the gallbladder that stimulates the gallbladder to contract, much like when you've eaten a large meal) into the I.V. and measure your ejection rate/ fraction (how long it takes for the gallbladder to empty it out).<br>  <br>  A normal ejection fraction would be anything 35% and above, below 35% would be abnormal, and you are likely to get a diagnosis of Biliary Dyskinesia, which is essentially<br>  gallbladder disease without stones.|`|tqt9yg3vaa	It is likely to be your gallbladder. Gallbladder pain is sometimes felt in unusual locations. This is called "referred pain."|`|70JTOlkkaa	i am having the same symptoms as you...i go in to the dr. tomorrow to see whats up.  my pain sometimes goes directly around to my back...almost exactly the same place as where it hurts on my front side.  i hope everything turns out ok for you!

3Wxx2FPkaa	Step1) identify the location of the broken blood vessels. Note locations on the skin where your broken blood vessels occur. <br>  <br>  Step2) Find a board-certified dermatologist. Start with your medical insurance plan. Most insurance plans include lists of approved doctors. Seek a dermatologist who specializes in treatment of vein abnormalities, such as spider veins and varicose veins. This doctor will have the skills to treat broken capillaries and broken blood vessels. <br>  <br>  Step3) Tell your dermatologist of any medical conditions you may have, as some conditions predispose people to broken blood vessels. Conditions that may cause broken blood vessels include rosacea, a common skin disorder usually affecting people with fair skin. Injuries can also cause broken blood vessels and capilaries. Your doctor will take a complete medical history, review the areas you point out where you want to get rid of broken blood vessels, discuss treatment plans and review options and costs with you. <br>  <br>  Step4) Undergo treatment. Depending on your condition, the doctor may be able to inject medicine into the area (sclerotherapy) to shrink the broken blood vessel or use a laser to remove the vessel. Both treatments are usually done in the doctor's office and may be done the same day or at subsequent appointments, depending upon the physician. <br>  <br>  Step5) Consider home treatments if you cannot afford to see a dermatologist. These include creams with Vitamin K, Vitamin E and calendula available at health food stores and pharmacies nationwide. Ice can minimize swelling for injury-caused broken blood vessels. Coverup makeup is an easy, affordable way to hide unsightly blood vessels, and such makeup is available in waterproof formulas for use on legs and arms too.|`|tSi10jneaa	I wish there was  cure for this but laser seems the only answer if done under a really qualified professional else it will just ruin your life.<br>  Other than that I think vitamin C should help.<br>  But trust me it's really easy to live with those broken vessels than take a laser treatment where even the doctor cannot guarantee you of results because everyone's face is different.<br>  To add you shouldn't be taking hot/warm/icy showers, also you have to cover your face in sun and not expose it to sun for minimum 10-12months from the day you take laser shot.<br>  Also depending on the severity it may take 5-6sittings just to see some visible improvement.<br>  Avoid spicy and hot food as much as possible and try to keep yourself calm anytime possible.<br>  Good luck

Perhaps something like that would help..<br>  <br>  Also, while not a pill, there is something called "ECT therapy" that they use when people are extremely suicidal and they can't wait weeks for the effect of antidepressants to work.  It works by giving your brain a quick 30 second seziure, which causes all the main chemicals in your brain to be released - all the chemicals that are also thought to cause depression.

6NZeItMAaa	Just about everyone who you talk to nowadays will complain about being “stressed out.” Thirty years ago, no one ever even used this term. Today, however, it is a staple in most conversations. We often refer to ourselves as being “stressed out” when we discuss our careers as well as our personal lives. <br>  <br>  Recent studies indicate that even children are “stressed out.” Little kids, who shouldn’t have a care in the world, are becoming “stressed” due to activities at home or at school. In most cases, they are simply inheriting the stress from their parents.<br>  <br>  Psychologists who deal with “stressed out” individuals blame the current situation on everything from the foods we eat to our society. Most agree that people today attempt to do “too much” and end up getting burned out. <br>  <br>  We all experience stress during the course of our lives. There is a difference, however, in being constantly stressed out and experiencing stress due to a certain situation. Anything that dramatically disrupts our lives is a cause for stress. Most people recover from the stressful situation after it has been resolved or over a period of time. <br>  <br>  Other people tend to get stressed out all the time. In fact, their entire life appears to be one big stress factory. This is unhealthy and is gradually taking its toll on our society. Each year, billions of dollars are spent on symptoms of stress. There are dozens of prescriptive medicines on the market today that address stress and anxiety. Millions of people are on some sort of medication for “stress<br>  <br>  If the cause of your stress is something over which you have no control, you need to evaluate the problem, face it and seek help. There are many different counseling methods that incorporate behavior techniques to address stress. Medication can be useful in some situations, but tranquilizes should never be a long term “cure” for stress. <br>  <br>  Natural cures for stress include behavior management techniques, proper diet and exercise, herbal remedies and yoga techniques. These will actually work towards alleviating your stress.|`|hXYjkCGpaa	Try theta wave music with these stress relieving techniques: <a href="http://stress-help-guide.com/easy-tips-to-stress-help/" rel="nofollow">http://stress-help-guide.com/easy-tips-t...</a>|`|207dFmdHaa	you ask an almost impossible question to answer, everyone stress level is different.  my mom always told me not to sweat the small stuff...but she was always so so cool in every situation....I have 6 kids and work full time as an attorney, my youngest kids are 4 year old triplets, and I am 55 years old.....my answer to your question is, I take 30 minutes a day just for me, no matter how hectic, in that 30 minutes, its just for me to regroup and think, sleep, soak in the bathtub, run, anything that is just for me.....it works, dont say you dont have 30 minutes....make the time and see how your stress level changes|`|689efd040f7aee45255236da1af351baaa	Try FREE Guided meditations at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://clicktomeditate.com" rel="nofollow">http://clicktomeditate.com</a><br>  <br>  This site has easy navigation, collects no personal information.<br>  <br>  All the meditations are free and full length with beautiful music.|`|q34vCB3Qaa	read a book,socialize with friends and family,have  a hobby|`|AA10500537	join a church group<br>  get a hobby <br>  just dont let things bother you it only makes it worst .|`|4yrqRS4qaa	mindfulness<br>  <a href="http://www.mindfullivingprograms.com/whatMBSR.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindfullivingprograms.com/wha...</a><br>  pema chodron and jon kabat-zinn are well known for this. <br>  <a href="http://www.umassmed.edu/content.aspx?id=41252" rel="nofollow">http://www.umassmed.edu/content.aspx?id=...</a>

5f33a94e5238789a063c0f100e622ee7aa	This is actually very strange in my opinion. It sounds like you need to visit a psychiatrist asap. It seems like you may have schizophrenia.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	You really need to see a doctor who then will either help you or get you a psychiatrist which you really seem to need. It may be you have the beginning of schizophrenia. Yes, I'm afraid it is unusual.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Well that is actually pretty damned strange.<br>  But I read your answer to the other question and it's obvious you are a reasonablel, sensitive person.<br>  Is it possible you have schitzophrenia?  The voices would very classically fit into that, along with hallucinations.  I imagine you could have a "mild" case of it that would lead to inappropriate thoughts.<br>  And who hasn't thought about killing people and eating them before!  (Wait, I haven't).<br>  But seriously, you need to be very careful.  This could spiral and you could get sicker and get out of control.  I've read a lot about serial killers and what's really scary is how normal they are otherwise - and don't seem like the sort of people at all.<br>  But another classic symptom of schitzophrenia would be paranoia about other people, and thinking they are plotting against you, and trying to control you, and in more serious cases believing somebody (such as aliens) is trying to control your brain - hence the tinfoil in the hat!<br>  I think you should get some counselling, and I have a feeling some medication could help you a lot to reduce the inappropriate thoughts - that's really a bit more than what is "normal" or acceptable.<br>  Good luck and congrats for realising something is wrong - most people can't.|`|2JTBPhuuaa	Sounds like you could use a visit to the psychiatrist.

It would be strange only if tartar sauce were involved with it also.|`|3tWlbje7aa	I have to concur with what other people have been stating regarding seeking help as this (I assume) is quite distressing for you. I would also see if you can get hold of a book called Imp of The Mind by Lee Baer. For what it's worth - and it isn't worth much, frankly being that I studied history at university and nothing in psychology at all - is that your apparent lucidity and rationality suggest that you are not suffering from psychosis or schizophrenia. I would put my money on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The thing is people do often have grisly or gory thoughts. The entire horror industry would not exist were it not for our fevered Imaginations. But most people just let those thoughts pass along with all the other flotsam and jetsam that float by. Your ruminations over these things, particularly as you say, when you are not busy are suggestive (to me anyway) of a thinking disorder. The safest thing for you to do is instead of worrying, go and talk it our properly with someone whose confidentiality you can trust and who can recommend a course of treatment. <br>  <br>  Do not panic but do indeed take care of yourself. Good luck.|`|Ewosh9pTaa	Easy Answer: Just keep busy then it's not a problem!<br>  Hard Answer: Sit alone in your room and welcome in the demons. Let them swirl around you as old friends who can teach you something. Work out why you want to eat human flesh. Is it because it is the ultimate horror show to disgust the average prick. Or is it because you really want to eat human flesh? <br>  Everyone has wired weird thoughts. Intrusive images. Everyone has dark sexual fantasies. The difference comes when you try to turn a fantasy into a reality. <br>  Play out these fantasies in a "safe" environment - if you really want to take it a step further and be "Hannibal Lecktor" in reality, then you should probably consider a long walk and medication.<br>  Only you know...|`|I7ZOgAsVaa	Im pretty sure that what you are suffering from is an actual disease that can be cured i remember watching a doco on it once. Go see a doctor who can then pass you on to people who can help you.<br>  Good luck|`|hb8Yisw7aa	Talk to your primary doctor first. See if he or see can recommend a mental health person to help you. It could just be a chemical imbalance or some kind of hormonal imbalance. Just please go see a doctor before you hurt yourself or someone else.|`|yA9NJhiyaa	well that is sort of unusual considering the fact that it is sort of well i don`t know cannibalism. you should go to the therapist. unless you feel like your going to eat him/her. just joking
ETcBRko3aa	No.    <br>  <br>  Bipolar episodes LAST longer than seconds or minutes.  They usually last weeks or months.

aMBQLNGqaa	Woah! first of all you do not need to loose any weight at all. All you can do is tone up. According to this site you are in the category of the normal weight BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9 (Normal Weight). <br>  And you're tall!<br>  Second you're calorie intake is way too low, no one should ever eat below 1200 calories for females, and you're 14 so you need all that energy to burn. <br>  The reason you're loosing weight is because you're body doesn't need to loose any weight. <br>  Just eat healthy foods, no processed junk and you'll be fine.<br>  For the exercise part you just have to do things that you enjoy like dancing, swimming or join a sports team, anything that you would enjoy.

e8Sgp92naa	It depends on the problem.  I would definitely not go back to that doctor.  If I had a big problem that needed medical attention right away I'd go see a different doctor right away.  If it wasn't something serious I'd wait a few months before making a new appointment with someone else.  You seem really worried.  There is no problem with going to see a different doctor asap.|`|4IZHdhJQaa	I would go see another dr, they aren't all like this, sounds like he was negligent by not even being able too explain a lab result! Most other dr's should be able too have your results sent too them, so keep your chin up and try again, so you can at least get too the bottom of the reason you visited the dr in the first place.|`|AA11596544	If you don't feel like believing in him, just find another doctor and try not to ignore the problem and cure it before it grows into something worse..|`|cMsC5a14aa	My doctor Hung-Fat shes a chinese woman that does not speak english too well so im always confused when i leave till i talk to her helper who can understand her
ufgv7oTjaa	It can be. Basically, Cayenne helps to increase circulation throughout the body (including to the eyes and sinuses), so there are people that take it daily to help keep their sinuses clear. However, I haven't heard of anyone actually taking out an infection unless their body was doing it on it's own already.<br>  As far as the eye irritation, it depends on what is irritating it. If it's a physical irritation, it won't do anything... if it's anything internal, it might clear it up or it might irritate it more. It really does depend on what's irritating it. The Cayenne just increases the circulation regardless. Good luck and I hope I helped!
sPT8ikgXaa	He is obsessive, jealous, controlling and border-line physically abusive.  You need to take him to a public place (have a friend wait in the car for you) and tell him you are leaving him.  Explain to him why.  He will try to pull the "but I love you...I'll never do it again" bullsh*t, but don't fall for it.  People like him will always say anything just to be able to get you where they want you again.  If for some reason you want to work it out, tell him it can only be done if he goes to get some help or goes to counceling with you.  From what you describe, he sounds like he is crazy and you need to get away from him.  If he starts to get worse or stalks you, you NEED to call the police, so they can be aware of what is going on and will make a report each time.  Please think of yourself first, take care and don't let anyone manipulate you like that.  I was with someone who manipulated me for 8 years and you start to think there is something wrong with you, but there isn't, its HIM.  And keep in mind, anyone who really LOVES you, will never hurt you in any way shape or form.|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	Restrain order from court.Leave!|`|aOn4c5DDaa	See, everyone here might talk like they're ur friend and tell u to leave him. And get over it!! Heck, all tat people know now a days are jus gettin over it .! But, tat's not long lastin. This is how i see it and how it REALLY is. First of all he IS ur boyfriend, meaning tat u had already chose to spend ur time with him. Now u jus need to stick with it. Not by force, but, by will. See. I can assure u tat He LOVES U A LOT., tat he doesn't even want to let u out of his sight. This may sound wierd and creepy but, tat's jus his way of expressing his love for you. So, if i get things straight. are u  saying that u want to leave ur man jus coz he loves u and shows u tat he does. Tat's not right, is it? See, to re-solve this issue. U need to do the foll. Things. First, go ahead and do whatever he says for some weeks, like if he wants u to take u somewhere go with him, spend most or all the time u have with him. Don't waste a second. Alright? Jus for some weeks. Then, one day sit him down n look into his eyes n say u love him n only him. N ur not gonna let go of him ever. But, tell him u need ur space to hang out with friends n stuff. This is probably the only way this could be sorted out the right way, hope u make the right choice. Good luck.

SrMt01nOaa	Because all life begins as female.<br>  <br>  When the fetus is developing it first is a girl, (so it has nipples), but as it develops genes either turn it into a boy or girl.<br>  <br>  So the nipples remain on both sexes. Yay.|`|nAvTMXmgaa	Some already asnwer you.<br>  But yes, they are very sensitive. Remember that with your guy.<br>  Then you'll see a new point.|`|AA10462002	No joke, my dad was telling me he saw a book at a bookstore titled:  "Why Men Have Nipples" lmaooo....  Now idk if it was a joke book, or if it was serious, but he said he was tempted to buy it just cuz it sounded so wierd, lol....<br>  <br>  Anyway, we got into a big discussion on it.  But my opinion is that the nipple is already there, it's just the X Chromosome that makes it grow.  I mean it's all science.  If you think about it, all our parts are essentially the same (except for the obvious).  However, the rest of the body is made the same, but different hormones (be it estrogen for female or testorone for the males) makes it develop different.  This is true in the nipples case whether they stay just nipples in a male, or grow into breasts for a female.  But true in other parts too, such as facial hair (woman do have it also occassionally.  I always get this one pesky hair, always comes a few days before my period on my chin.) Anyways, the hair follicles are there, but the testosterone causes it to grow, or the estrogen stops it from growing, idk...  Same with regular hair.  woman's hair grows much longer than male's.  Yes some guys can grow their hair long also, but it's much harder for them.  Again, this also shows as you get older and males start balding.  Also think about the voices.  We both have voices, we can both talk, but testosterone makes the voice deeper.  I can't think of other examples on the top of my head.  But my guess is that again aside from the obvious, God (sorry if you're not religious) took the easy way out and made the rest of us essentially the same.  We all have 2 ears, 2 eyes, and a nose and a mouth.  We all have 10 fingers and 10 toes.  And we each have 2 nipples (whether or not they decide to grow and have a use).  That's why God also invented estrogen and testosterone, allowing science to finish what he started.  He didn't have to make anyone different.  Science takes care of the rest.<br>  <br>  Ok, idk if any of that actually made sense.  I can't explain it, but I know it in my head, lmaoooo<br>  <br>  Or you can just go to the library and look up that book that my dad found, lol....  Then report back and tell us :-)|`|b7vdkAAIaa	it's probably on one X chromosome and not on the other - women have two Xs and men have XY - the mammary gland part is probably on the other women's X - so both sexes have nipples but one only mammary glands|`|XAkLPdhqaa	They're about as useless as **** on a nun.|`|7iHEKb8kaa	Chasing Cars said it.

Lor20kXcaa	I just inject under the table.<br>  <br>  At a restaurant you'll need your insulin, because you'll eat more than normal.<br>  <br>  Just inject as usual, and no-one will notice, or care.<br>  <br>  I never do it in a rest room, far too unhygienic.<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone tell you you can't do it.<br>  <br>  Good luck. No-one should ever make you feel bad because of your illness.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Absolutely!  You need your fast acting insulin with you when you eat, take it just as your food is arriving, or immediately after you eat.  You can go to the restroom, or you can do it through your jeans right at the table.  You might get a glance or two, but who cares...we've gotta do what we've gotta do.  People inject in restaurants all the time, just try to be discreet.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	Yes, I take my shorter acting insulin with me to restaurants for dinner, and inject myself in the rest-room. I'm on two injections of Novolin (N (breakfast) and 70/30 (around dinner)), after more than 33 years of being on one injection in the morning of mixed Eli Lilly Ultra-lente and Semi-lente. It felt really strange to stop mixing insulin when I decided to eliminate the R in the breakfast dose, without the advice of a doctor. I've always been sensitive to regular insulin, and my sensitivity has increased since I've been post-menopausal most of the time.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	You should have your insulin with you any time you are going to be around food.<br>  When my son took shots, he did so right at the table, but did as much as he could to be discrete (he's on the pump now).  Some bathrooms at restaurants are kinda dirty - do you really want to do it there instead of putting your stuff on a napkin at the table?<br>  Remember to take something to put the used needle in and then bring it home for proper disposal.  Don't throw your needle in the regular trash.<br>  You'll eventually work out a system that works best for you.|`|6adc597e9fb33038cff31ccea702d7bcaa	People do it all the time you just don't notice them.  My 3 year old daughter is a type 1, and the few occasions when we've gone out to eat I just did everything at the table.  Don't worry, after a while it'll start to seem more normal to you, and you won't feel so self conscious about it.|`|KGRikkJeaa	my aunt used to check and inject before we got into the restraunt...other than that im not sure what her level was at or anything.|`|e8Sgp92naa	You don't see it because it is surprizingly easy to inject at a table and not even have the people you are sitting with notice.  Just inject in your stomach by pulling up your shirt a tiny bit under the table.  It's really descrete.  <br>  <br>  And NEVER let the fear of looking stupid prevent you from taking insulin.  THAT would make you look really stupid.|`|sZ5PMfWCaa	I just inject where i am. If people have a problem, they don't have to look. If they stare at me, i stare back. At school, out for dinner, on the bus, train, wherever. <br>  We need to take it in order to stay healthy.<br>  <br>  Dont worry about it man.

Before that our bodies are still too young to have any body builder status. However, you can definitely get definition and toned, and food is a major part of the exercise routine. If you eat junk food, no matter how strong abdominal region is, all you will see is a pudgy belly. Try eatting more lean meats, fruit and vegetables, and nuts. I hear the oils and nutrients in nuts are very good for a guy's diet. Finally, do not attempt to work your abs every day. You need rest periods for your muscles to recuperate. This is the time you should be consuming more protein so the muscles can heal and grow. Best of luck!|`|VMIR9IoKaa	yes it can, but make sure you're doing them properly so you don't strain your neck or something. Keep in mind that you have upper and lower abdominals. Sit ups will work your abs, but you'll need to find something else to work the lower abs. Try making a bridge with your body (stomach down) while supporting your weight on your toes and your hands. Hold this for 30 seconds.|`|DoYQeqGhaa	well....... im 15 an i do 60 sit ups a day, 4 min bridge, 700 jumping jacks, and yeah,  with sit ups comes abs, but only if you are eating healthy foods and protein for muscle development! u also need to be doing regulay situps for like ages! inorder for those abs to show through! but doing 80 a day( providing that yr actually doing them properly) is an awesome starter!|`|y3I1qSHEaa	Just doing sit ups is not enough.

AA10642136	Your question is actually a really good one.<br>  <br>  The first thing to do is to assess whether your body is really suited to jogging.  If you have problems with your knees etc, I would suggest that you jog on a treadmill which is a lot less wear and tear.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't have knee problems, you will need to purchase a really good set of running shoes with lots of cushioning.<br>  <br>  The next thing to do is figure out what your goals are and work toward those.<br>  <br>  If you're a beginner,  walk at a very brisk rate and build up to periods of jogging.  It may take a while but you'll get there.|`|udUzdU7Raa	You seem to have the right idea already.<br>  Yes, if you are just a beginner, start off by "speed walking" for about half and hour, or even 20mins. Build it up until you can easily do 45mins. Then start going faster at a jogging pace. When you start jogging, go back to 20-30mins, and then build it up again. Try to go at the same or a similar time each day to help your body recover each time. Keep things regular will help you get fit. If you get really sore muscles one day from it, just walk at a slow pace until they mend so that you don't do any damage, but still get hte exercise. This will also help to keep your muscles loose.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope you enjoy your exercising!!|`|f8kdvjnvaa	dont forget to stay hydrated, and drink enough water when doing this.

Your muscles need to be warmed up before you do any heavy weight.  Starting out with a heavy weight could tare the muscle and that would not be good.

KOYC3XkJaa	Yes, you can go swimming with a broken blister as long as it's covered. The reasons for that are, depending on where you're swimming, you will otherwise be risking infection or pain (from say chlorine getting into it).<br>  Waterproof bandages are not uncommon, you can find them at any pharmacy and drugstore. I have no idea what Woolworth's is but if it's a pharmacy-type store, they should have waterproof bandages/band-aids/plasters.|`|23hPHjOqaa	Sure you can, if you want to be really safe then wear a waterproof plaster like you said - I don't know about you but all the Woolworth's around here have closed now, its better to go to a pharmacy or a larger store such as Tesco or Sainsbury they have more stock and more options.<br>  <br>  However remember that the job of chlorine in the pool is to kill bacteria, and so I believe in my professional opinon that it is better if you go uncovered, and trust me when i say it may sting a little when you first get in the pool but it will very quickly go away especially when you start swimming.

The TB test is a form of the TB virus whether it's killed or modified-live I don't know, or it could be fragments of the virus. Anyways, there is a small chance that you have a chest cold as an indirect result of the test. I'm pretty sure you can't get TB from the test. If you feel the area where they injected you and there is no bump that is a negative test. <br>  <br>  When I first found out I was pregnant and they did the test on me the nurse was only 80% sure it was negative because I had a small reaction to the liquid they injected, the doctor read it and said it was in fact negative. <br>  <br>  If you are super concerned give the doc a call and they should be able to ease any concerns.

You know what's going on.  And now you've got to do more than just be scared.  Indeed, the real question is what you're going to do about it:  <br>  <br>  --You need to work with your insurnace co. to find out what doctor she can see for reimbursement/coverage.  <br>  <br>  --Call to see if there is a Shriner's Hospital near you; they're free.  <br>  <br>  --What she ultimately needs is a neurologist, preferably a pediatric neurologist.  <br>  <br>  --The hospital should have a referral list of doctors, but confirm with your ins. co. that they will be covered under your policy.  You may need to write, or have a doctor, write a letter petitioning for coverage to see a particular doctor or get particular tests or treatments.  <br>  <br>  --Keep all your documentation from the hospital, etc.  Also, it is an excellent idea in general for ALL patients to get, and keep, a copy of their medical records and to review them.   <br>  <br>  --Ask the billing department at the hospital how much it would cost during the next ER visit should your family request that she be seen by a neurologist before discharge from the ER.  See if you can swing that payment.  <br>  <br>  --Depending on the size of your hospital and your town, there should be at least a neurologist on-call even though s/he normally sees adults.  You DO have the right to request this and get that assessment.  <br>  <br>  --Prior to another ER visit:  Read and review your policy about coverage.  Don't just rely on the short "summary of benefits" booklet or pages they hand you--make sure you read the "biggie" that has all the clauses and omissions and whatnot in it.  <br>  <br>  If it sounds like she would be covered, call and ask your insurance company, just in case, to confirm your understanding.  Also, it doesn't hurt to put it in writing:  As I understand on page 1,035, and per my discussion with Jane Doe,....  <br>  <br>  If there is coverage if your request she be seen by a neurologist prior to ER discharge.  There probably is coverage, but absolutely ask anyway to be sure.  <br>  <br>  Whether talking to the billing department or the ins. co., difinitely keep a log:  Who said what, when, where, at what time, etc.  <br>  <br>  --If you have a teaching hospital nearby, they should have pediactric neurology clinics and specialists available.  <br>  <br>  --It seems, at a minimum, she needs medication.  But they can do a few tests beyond a CT scan to determine what TYPE of seizure(s) she's having (you can suffer from more than one type) and what then would be an appropriate treatment plan.  <br>  <br>  --I think you need to write/file some serious complaints about the ER.  Their behavior makes no sense.  Re-read the ER discharge papers to see what they specifically say about followup, if anything.  <br>  <br>  --If necessary, contact your state department of health or social services and see what medical coverage they can offer based on your income if any.  <br>  <br>  Bebs and Robert are also offering relevant info.  <br>  <br>  You don't have to be, or feel, powerless.  <br>  <br>  Get busy, you and your family have got work to do.|`|oq8F1qfUaa	hope i could help, but i think you should seek a specialist--a neurologist.. others do have seizures and that is normal to them..does your sister have a fever?high temp could also causes seizures.. but just to be safe, seek medical help

wwP3ONCFaa	Livor mortis is the settling of blood. It is also called Hypostasis.<br>  <br>  When the heart stops, the blood stops circulating and gravity makes it settle. This makes the areas where the blood has settled turn dark blue or purple.<br>  <br>  This starts happening immediately and is visible with a couple of hours. At this point skin is bluish and blotchy. After five or six hours the blotches have joined up but the skin still goes white when pressed. After ten to twelve hours the blue colour remains even when pressed.<br>  <br>  The lividity doesn't show where the body is in contact with something. This a body lying on its back will show lividity in the small of its back, its neck etc but not is parts of the body directly touching the ground. This a very useful when determining if a body has been moved after death.<br>  <br>  The discolouration looks like a bruise, but experts can easily tell them apart.<br>  <br>  With some poisons the discoloration is different.

wwP3ONCFaa	ill give you a few tips, but dont share it your friends :<br>     <br>  1. Schedule your sickness. Timing is everything. The best day to miss a day of school usually tends to be Wednesday. This is because it is towards the middle of the week since it is not a particularly important day, and you can get everything done on Thursday or Friday so that your sick day doesn't take a toll on your weekend. You'll have the whole weekend to do whatever you want. If you fake sick a lot, don't try it on a Monday, because your parents might get suspicious that it just happened to occur right when you need to go to school. Don't fake sick after a holiday or a break, this just shows that you want an extra day off of school and your parents will definitely send you to school.<br>  <br>            * If there is an illness going around, do some research and find out all the symptoms. Later you can hint that you "hope it's not that bug".<br>            * If you have siblings that also go to school with you, make sure that they are not going to fake sick on the same day as you. It just becomes one big mess.<br>     2. Begin the night before. If you are planning on staying home the next day, tell your mom or dad that you don't feel well the night before.<br>  <br>            * If you've been ill before with a virus or bug repeat those symptoms; it will seem less like your faking. If you've been to see someone who had a cold or something replicate those symptoms so it seems as though you caught it from them.<br>            * Stomach problems. Only eat bits and pieces of dinner; when your parent(s) ask what's wrong, tell them that your stomach hurts. Make sure you have snacks hidden in your room so you can miss a meal because you're "not feeling well." If you normally do your homework, get started on it, but put your head down periodically so that they see you're not feeling well and it's interfering with your work.<br>            * Sore throat. This only works if your parents are not the over-worrying kind. If you have over-protective parents that go running to the emergency room over a minor strep throat, do not attempt. The day before you plan to fake a sore throat, say that you're feeling a bit scratchy in your throat, and clear your throat a lot. That night, at about 7:45pm/8:00pm, say that you feel tired, and that you have a headache.<br>            * Cold/flu. Breathe only through your mouth, as if your nose is stuffed. Wear many layers of clothing. This makes it look as though you are freezing, since sick people feel cold easily. Sneeze loudly, then sniffle in front of your parents. Do this also when they're not in the same room but can overhear you from wherever they are. While they're not looking, rub your forehead, face, and eyes (if you have parents who check your face for temperature) then approach them, saying you don't feel so great. It'll make your face red and warm.<br>     3. Go to bed early. Don't say anything. When you're around them, just walk out of the room and go to your bed. Don't brush your teeth--they'll probably wake you up to remind you. At that point, they'll probably wonder what's wrong, and you can tell them that you're not feeling well. Describe your "symptoms" and appear impatient, maybe even cranky, and eager to go to bed.<br>     4. Prepare to have your temperature taken. If you do a good job, your parents will probably want to take your temperature, in which case you can read this article on how to get your temperature readings up when they check.<br>     5. Wake up in the middle of the night. If you're pretending to have stomach issues, wake them up at about 1:00 A.M. and tell them you just threw up (having left some fake vomit in the toilet). For flu or sore throat symptoms, cough or clear your throat loudly enough to alarm them, and rub your face vigorously right before they come in.<br>  <br>     6. Stay up till late at night. This gives you bags underneath your eyes, and you will have a legitimate reason to have a day off. Be aware you might be asleep for the day though.<br>     7. Reinforce your feigned illness in the morning. Be especially reluctant to get out of bed. If they still want to make you go to school, get up, but sluggishly. Slowly dress, but not too slowly. Skip a button on your shirt, don't comb your hair properly, and don't tie your shoe laces properly (or even at all). Pick at your breakfast as if you have no appetite. If you're pretending to have a cough, go to the bathroom upon rising and rub your eyes with water a bit, just to give yourself slightly "sick eyes." If you didn't start faking symptoms the night before, it'll be much more difficult to convince your parents that you're sick. Here are some other last-minute strategies you can try:<br>  <br>            * Wake up before your parents and quietly make fake vomit. Put it in the toilet and pretend to throw up. If this doesn't wake them up, go get them and tell them what just "happened".<br>            * Say you have diarrhea. Be sure to spend some time in the bathroom, flush the toilet, and spr|`|511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	you need to drink alot of milk (to induce vomiting) and take some stimulants to induce bowel movements.

3QIWdvG1aa	Diagnosing dengue fever can be difficult. That's because its signs and symptoms can be easily confused with those of other diseases, such as malaria, leptospirosis and typhoid fever. Still, diagnosis of dengue fever is typically done by evaluating your signs and symptoms along with your medical and travel history. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will likely ask about these. In addition, your blood may be tested for evidence of a dengue virus.<br>  <br>  Medical history<br>  Your doctor will likely ask about your medical and travel history and any exposure to mosquitoes. Be sure to describe international trips in detail, including the countries you visited and the dates, as well as any contact you may have had with mosquitoes.<br>  <br>  Blood tests<br>  Laboratory tests, usually using a sample of your blood, are needed to confirm a diagnosis of dengue fever. If you have dengue fever, your blood may reveal the virus itself. If not, blood tests known as hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) also can detect antigens, antibodies or nucleic acids specific to the viruses. These tests may take several days.

No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

Pay attention to what is happening around you.

As soon as you catch yourself dreaming, stop and pay attention! When you eat your breakfast, pretend you have never done such a thing before and pay attention to what it's like, what it feels like, what it tastes. Listen to the sounds around you.

Now you could probably get away with it as I left them in several times in college last year if I crashed at a friend's and hadn't brought my glasses out with me. Usually, your eyes are just a bit sore but feel better once you take them out...however, one time after having them in for only a few hours while I slept, when I woke up the next day I couldn't open my eyes. They felt like they were glued shut. Eventually, after much effort and pain I cracked 'em open only to find my eyes FILLED with blood. It scared the hell out of me.

GMcKAWWuaa	Use your left hand to hold up your top eye lid. Hold your finger on the meaty part under your eyelashes and pull up. If you hold on there you wont be able to blink. Pull lashes straight up . Pull down lower lids with right hand and put contact in with right pointy finger. Unless you are left handed . You must look straight a head. Most people try to push to hard when they are putting them in. YOu cant push it on your eye you have to just let it go on by itself.

AcY9JgJsaa	A pimple? Though its never a good idea to pop or mess with them if it is a pimple then you could sterilize a needle by burning the tip or using alcohol.  You then get the sterilized needle and gently poke the head.  Don't squeeze though as you will just push stuff further in, and let it drain.  If you need to push the pus out then use your fingertips not your nails, and push around the are and not directly on it.  All the stuff should come out.  Just be sure to clean the area well before and after you do this.  It would also help if you got a hot towel and placed it on the spot before you do this as it will bring everything upwards and makes it possible to get it all out.  Just make sure its not too hot you don’t want to burn your skin.  Also don’t puncture your skin with the needle just gently poke the head until all the stuff drains.  This always works for me and I hope it works for you! Just remember to do this only for spots that have a head and are ready, and keep in mind its not a good idea to mess with them, it could cause further scaring and bacterial spread, but if you still want to do it go ahead I’m not trying to lecture you, haha.  Hope it helps. :~)|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	Stick a disinfected needle in it and it will all come shooting out.|`|kmIcAySEaa	Warm water on a wash cloth works good, just keep it warm and covered.

ed1fd474ffe907b183e2991c2f9b248daa	Gosh there are some good answers here.<br>  I just wanted to add about your child. Be very consistent with him, that is the most important thing. Think carefully before you say anything to him because you need to be able to carry through - so if you carelessly say ' don't you dare' he will - and what are you going to do? So don't say it! <br>  If you say things clearly ad explain the consequences of not doing it then follow through - every time. By not following through people teach their children that they don't mean what they say and then the child plays up because they know they can!<br>  So parent may say - 'don't do that, or I'll throw your toy in the bin' then the child does it and the parent throws the toy away (but can't bear to part with it, as it was expensive) and so gets it out of the bin a day later - child thinks - 'I can do what I want - they'll give it back in a day!'<br>  The other thing I would really strongly recommend is a good quality fish oil supplement after two weeks I have seen a remarkable change in children - so much so that I take it myself now -- its not cheap but its really worth it. There are several brands, but it has to be a high dose one - the one I have is on the link, and an article to explain how it works in the brain.<br>  You may benefit from it to (you can take the childs one) t may help you feel more optimistic - I'd make sure every person in the country took it if I could!|`|5dTqcpMzaa	Keep positive!<br>  <br>  Have you tried looking into any anti-depression meds?

4GNNOQeLaa	Type 2 Diabetes patients can have almost anything in moderation.  Our bodies need glucose to run, of course too much is not a good thing either.  As long as the carrot juice does not have too much sugar if any, you should be just fine.  I assume that you test your blood sugar regularly and know when it is high or not.  If you don't test then no reason to worry about what you eat and don't because you have no idea what your readings are.  I would be more concerned with fruit juices because these tend to have lots of sugar in them.  They are good when your blood sugar is too low and you need a quick jump start.|`|bmWKETgWaa	Type 2 diabetes patients are typically referred by their doctors to registered dieticians, who help them work out a personalized diet plan.  These plans are generally based on controlling the amount of carbohydrates the diabetic person should eat or drink.  All people need some carbohydrates in their diet -- they're what fuels our muscles and particularly our brain cells.  The dietician's role is to determine how much carbohydrate the diabetic person needs in order to function, and how much would be an overflow that would cause a rise in blood sugar. <br>  <br>  To keep things simple, they work in terms of "carbohydrate exchanges".  Each exchange is approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate.  This translates into such things as one slice of bread, one small piece of fruit, half a cup of starchy vegetables such as green peas, or one tablespoon of jam or jelly.  <br>  <br>  No one particular food is evil or forbidden -- it's just that some of them are pretty costly in terms of their carbohydrate content versus the usual serving size.  If someone wanted a cupcake, for example, it would probably cost them 3 or 4 exchanges from their daily plan.  A typical allowance for an entire day might be between 10 and 15 exchanges, depending on the patient's age, sex, weight, activity level, and medications.<br>  <br>  At bookstores one can get diet guides that give the nutritional values of many foods.  Also, the back labels on containers of packaged foods show the carbohydrate values.  The US government publishes a very thorough booklet called "Nutritive Value of Foods" which gives the calorie, protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamin and mineral content of many foods.  I didn't see carrot juice listed, but it did say that an 8-ounce serving of vegetable juice cocktail contained 11 grams of carbohydrates.  So a diabetic person could drink an 11-ounce glass of V-8 juice and get one 15-gram exchange of carbohydrate.  (Proportionately, 8 ounces is to 11 grams as 11 ounces is to 15 grams).  This sounds like a good trade-off -- only one exchange to get all those vitamins and minerals.  If it's canned carrot juice, the label will give more specific information.  <br>  <br>  The bottom line is, the main thing diabetics must monitor in their diets is carbohydrates, which are starches and sugars of all kinds.  Like all of us, they really do need some, but they should follow a plan from a registered dietician that tells them how much.|`|FSDwXVGvaa	yes why not|`|030b10549427535294fae2bcd76c38fcaa	Doctor Mendosa wrote this :<br>  Eat Your Carrots!<br>  For fully 20 years we have had questions about whether to eat carrots or not. The first journal article ever published on the glycemic index indicated that we quickly digest the carbohydrates in carrots. That study that showed the GI of carrots at 92 (where glucose = 100). A later study that got much less attention showed the GI of carrots to be 49.<br>  <br>  For more info look at his web pages  Mendosa.com

Cx5Zo7IIaa	It's time to clear out your system. Quit for 4 - 6 weeks, it sounds hard but it's not. The most that will happen is you won't sleep that great for the first couple of nights but man will you get ripped when you pick it back up. But while you are not smoking, fast a little bit, a couple of days of just drinking juices and eating veggies. You've gotta let your body equalize every now and again, otherwise you get to the point where you are at. Oh if you're going to do this put away all your stuff and get away from it and your friends if need be. But then again if they are your friends they will respect what your doing.

That can be a difficult time of life but escaping thru drugs is not the answer. I've heard people say they like to be "high" because life and the world sucks, maybe you feel that way. You've made your body so dependent on drugs that "real" life is not exciting, but the thing is what you're experiencing when you're "high" is not real either and your ruining your body and it may cost you your life. I suggest doing some research or seeing a therapist. You're not a doctor so you can't know that much about prescription meds. What does your mom think about your drug habit? If you have things going on in your life that you say most people couldn't handle, then maybe that's why you "escape" thru drugs.

qrGLcTh4aa	That is so common! Seriously don't feel bad and don't avoid the dentist due to your fear. Look for a practice in your area that will offer being anestisized. Some dentists work with outside anesthesiologists to put to sleep nervous patients. This service will come with a hefty fee to you. Most insurance plans won't cover that expense, as it's considered elective.<br>  I worked for 7 years with a large specialty dental group and we had a periodontist there who was also an anesthesiologist. On several occasions he would put to sleep patients who were too afraid to be awake for the procedure.<br>  "Gas" or Nitros works okay. The thing is, that it does not(or should not) completely knock you out. It's usually cut 50/50 with pure oxygen. That blend will give you a feeling that you have had a couple of drinks.|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	I was in my thirties and needed a tooth filled.  I was very nervous about it and didn't want to go because I wanted the gas instead of a shot.  My friend's told me they only use gas on kids.

Which he did and I don't remember a thing, went out like a light.|`|5fMAvu5naa	Because I am allergic to the normal meds used for dentistry, I have always been given gas.I never remember anything and I wake up minus pain.When I was little , I looked forward to this because I always got a present from the dentist..man did we have guppies( small tiny fish)..Ask for alternatives and be direct and honest with your dentist.Medical field has heard and seen it all so don't be embarrassed or feel less of a person.There are all kinds of alternatives to your problem and solutions to your problem.Good luck and let us know how it goes.|`|lmHBKBxYaa	I doubt it.

Take at least 3 months off from protein.  You can get protien from other food sources.  Then when you are ready to go back on the protien, try Muscle Milk LITE.  You will still get all the nutrients from a protien shake but with halve the protien as a regular shake.  Dont worry about stopping for the 3 months.  Just like when you change up your workout, you are changing up your body system.  Also drink lots of water as this will help with detoxing your system.|`|Y4v2tm3Naa	Not sure how big you started but sounds like your trying to lose some weight.

ufgv7oTjaa	Actually, that's a question that would be best to ask a pharmacist or a doctor. Doctors and pharmacists both have access to a database of drug interactions and they can tell you quickly if you can safely take them together or not.... anyone here will just have a best guess from searching on the internet (which isn't always accurate, as we all know) ;-) <br>  That being said, if you're having an allergic reaction to something, it's best to avoid that allergen because if you keep taking it (whether you're masking the symptoms or not), it can do damage to your system over time. It may take a few days or a few years, but it will beat down on your immune system over time and people that mask the allergic reactions they are getting are the ones that typically get sick a lot down the line... my mother was one of them and her immune system is so compromised right now that she has severe reactions whenever she's around any chemical scents (even a light perfume/cologne).

pUIGCtaZaa	You need to seek the professional help of a therapist. They will help you sort out your issues from a completely non-judgmental viewpoint. Going to therapy really is beneficial, so I would definitely recommend it to you. If you cannot afford to see a therapist, make an appointment with your doctor and express all of your concerns with them so that you can be properly diagnosed.|`|AA11747527	I don't think you have all of those illnesses!  Maybe just one.  Perhaps your just bipolar which is causing the depression, paranoia and anxiety.  You need to get checked out by a doctor or therapist... especially if it is bipolar disorder.  That is something you absolutely need to take medication for otherwise it can really screw up your life.  It really depends on how severe you're symptoms are though.  You're young too so you can grow out of some of this, especially the anxiety.  <br>  <br>  I had extreme social anxiety and i thought i had Social Anxiety Disorder but since i finally started to improve I realized I shouldn't label myself with that, perhaps i was just very shy.  Still the anxiety is there... my point is anxiety gets better over time but the paranoia and depression are a bit harder to handle without help.

YSr8dm5faa	There is no specific time when wisdoms tooth erupt because each person's physiology is unique. The standard eruption 'date' for wisdom teeth is between 17-21 yrs old and sometimes they dont fully erupt until age 25. Very often wisdom teeth cause overcrowding which could lead to inflammation of the gum and malalignment of the dental arch. For this reason, dentists often recommend extraction of the wisdoms especially when it leads to periodic excrutiating pain. I dont like the dentists either, but they are the specialists when it comes to teeth and oral care so I suggest you see one.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed when I was a Jr in HS.  Not all wisdom teeth have to come out.  But, if they do, you usually go see an oral surgeon to have it done.  A dentist can pull a tooth, but wisdom teeth are harder to do because of the location.<br>  <br>  My OS stuck a needle in my arm and I was out cold.  I woke up in another room laying down with my father by my side.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  My mouth was reeeaaallllllllyyyyyyyyy dry when I woke up, but the pain only lasted for a day or two.<br>  <br>  I smoked and drank from a straw the same day.  It really isn't that big of a deal.  I HATE dentists as well.  Just the thought of a needle in my gums makes me cry and shake.|`|GJ5I4Lgdaa	sometimes they dont come up, sometimes they need to be removed, go speak to your dentist and discuss what your options are
TiW72sAUaa	They will more than likely do an x-ray anyway to find out what the problem is if nothing is visible. My sister had to have 2 wisdom teeth removed December last year. She was bricking it and when she went she felt nothing and was only in the chair for 6 mins. Now she doesnt know what she was worried about. It is worth getting checked out though if you are in that much pain.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

(notice while you sleep, you do actually burn some calories to keep you alive)<br>  <br>  this means, don't eat right before you sleep, because it is just going to go straight to fat. if you are starving go for something low cal low carb, and high in nutrient.<br>         <br>                                DIET PILLS IN GENERAL<br>  so the pill basically will ask your body to use your fat cells, most likely by causing your small intestines to be unable to extract nutrient from your food. this fat is now powering your body. though it can only block so much.<br>  <br>                                               RISKS<br>  this is dangerous because your body needs nutrients and energy.<br>  also it is (no matter what type) is asking your body to do something it is not supposed to, so that can have adverse affects.<br>  <br>                 YOUR BODY WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT NEEDS<br>  ok, alot of times we feel sick, or have an adverse reaction and we don't like it so we turn to medicine. its not always the case. alot of times you may actually be ignoring your bodies cry for help.<br>  <br>  do you feel slightly nausea burping up fluids? did you just eat something greasy? this is often a side effect of your body consuming too much fat. <br>  <br>  acid reflex? burning sensation in back of throat/chest?<br>  your stomach reacts to how much you eat and plans accordingly. if you are eating too much, it will make too much acid which will irritate your body. temporary fix, eat something basic(meaning a ph level over 7) antacids are one thing, crackers, bread, peanut butter all work, even wat|`|3400dcc36cd7e08d699a31910920945baa	the tablet is called acomplia and not acompa.. yes it is true it will help you loose weight but it doesn't work by converting fat to muscle, it will work on the pleasure center in your brain, it blocks the brain reward system... you know because everybody enjoys a nice meal... french reaserchers found that this tablet also helps in fighting smoking, alchoholisim and drug addiction!!!

F9Ll7oLJaa	do kapalbhati pranayam as suggested by baba Ramdev in Aastha channel|`|X9QOHRLFaa	well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

The sole thing that really showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a handful of free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Fox News and USA Today.

CnGR2xeoaa	I had a friend with a similar complaint, she wasn't overweight, she was just extremely large and icaused her progblems including back pain. She had breast reduction surgery. It was a simple procedure and she was out and about the same day.<br>  Some of he answerers on here really need to consider the impact oversized breasts can have on a woman.<br>  Try seeing a plastic surgeon, usually the same surgeons that do enlargements also do reductions. It is important that you select one you trust and that is reputable.<br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|cWuumdy7aa	you can not make them  smaller. i thought every one wants big breast and you should be happy as there are many question on how to increase the breast size.you can do certain excecises to make them firm.|`|fPJTZwoUaa	be grateful u got breast and stop worrying|`|rLsphyqhaa	Most women are looking or many any way to have the enlarged they are not happy with what they have but you wish to make them smaller. Surgery is the only way, unless they cause you a lot of discomfort in the back, shoulders and such be happy with what you have. It can be just as costly to reduce as it is to increase. Pretty much the same Doc can do both. Best of luck have only heard of maybe tow that had it done in the make smaller than make them bigger many seam to do that. i even know of at least there and they live next door that went for the bigger thing.|`|J1J47FIAaa	Wear baggier shirt. <br>  Get breast reduction (although recommended if you have back problems)<br>  Exercise.|`|AA11593134	I think surgery is the best answer.

xnZi0i8saa	You are not bipolar.... all of us get irritated sometimes. Sounds like your sister is just trying to get under your skin. It's also perfectly normal to be sad when your boyfriend is away..... don't give yourself more to worry about. You're perfectly normal.|`|AA10723498	No, you are not bi-polar, trust me.  Who doesn't get angry and lash out at times.  I know I do.  Who doesn't get ticked off when someone is constantly bothering them?  I get that way.  Everyone, I don't care who they are, have moments of anger when something isn't going right, or someone just gets on our nerves.  It's only natural, it doesn't mean you are bi-polar.  Heck, if that were the case, the entire world would be on medication for that.  Don't worry, your sister is only trying to aggravate you more by saying that.  I know what it's like to grow up with aggravating siblings.  I'm one of 8 girls and 4 brothers.  So, I do understand.  I also took care of bi-polar people and you don't fit the profile.  Relax, she's just teasing you.  And as far as being depressed, yeah, having a long distance relationship can cause depression because you can't be with the one you love,  Another thing that is completely understandable and natural.  I wish you the best|`|T497f0iwaa	No, you are probably not "bi-polar."<br>  <br>  True "bi-polar" disorder is a rare mental illness.

ejbSFv0caa	Whilst not 'normal' it is very common.<br>  <br>  Often girls will find such deformities add to the pleasure rather than diminish.  The only trouble you might have is certain positions will be easier than others.<br>  <br>  A lot will depend upon the unique properties of not only your own body but that of your partner.  Many girls are equally malformed internally. [Retroversion]<br>  <br>  So never let it get to be a problem.  As for the cosmetic appearance again most girls couldn't care less.  Unless of course they have had previous experience and found it ADDED to their pleasure ;]<br>  <br>  Update:  I wasn't going to bother adding Peroni's disease as a possible cause until I read some other A's.  On further thought it is best you get examined unless 1] you have no pain 2] you know when it happened. Look at the links provided by others & realise from the other men answering [not the children] that it is VERY common for some bend - what you describe is within the range I would call common.  Also Size might cause you concern about getting examined - If I told you the average height of the American male is 5'9.5 would you have thought it was the 6' we often hear?  The figures spouted for Penis length are frankly all over the place.<br>  Suffice it to say anything over a couple of inches backed with some skill and the will to make you partners time with you pleasurable is sufficient!<br>  <br>  There is a lot of rubbish posted that uses small sample sets of selected groups, often put together to make others feel inferior.  Or tainted by the fact that smaller men are less inclined to take part.  So get a check up -get the peace of mind and hopefully all your worry is for nothing and your future partner will enjoy all of you exactly as you are!<br>  <br>  The common cause for a pronounced bend are Peroni's Desease, or a trauma such as a kick whilst erected.  Both can be corrected if really needed.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is irrelevant unless you are actually injuring yourself whilst erected!  By that I mean causing PAINFUL injury.  So there should be no reason to feel embarrassed if you let a Doctor examine you.  The average City GP sees MANY genitals every year.  One more bent 1 will not be an issue.  Unless you are into kinky self torture.|`|E64juLwJaa	A curve is nothing to get worried about:it will still function ok.<br>  You can still pleasure girls.<br>  Planets.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Ignore the two cretins that gave you the first 2 answers , this is quite common and would say visit your doctor regarding this problem . this can be sorted out so do not worry . cheerio .|`|Eku8XD2Gaa	it is normal and u will be able to satisfy ur gal  complaetely dont worry it is a myth that penis should be straight in order to have maximum pleasure|`|hy3q2iWaaa	bending of the penis happen when a guy squeeze it too hard during masturbation, and done frequently.

My penis is also bent to the left.  Your penis will get hard and ejaculate with no problem.  There might be a chance your penis will give more pleasure to a girl because it will make better contact with the vaginal wall.  Also there is more contact for your penis also so enjoy your ejaculations.  You don't mention if you masturbate.  Do you and are your able to ejaculate and come?  If you don't have a problem doing that, you won't have any problems with intercourse.|`|qzpQdJ44aa	A lot of guys have penis that's bent towards the left or the right.  It's more common than you think.  Don't worry, the penis at the base is quite flexible and it can be 'pivoted' to allow penetration quite easily.  Nothing to worry about.  Just chill out!|`|tsn34pS4aa	was this from a vigorous sex ordeal or just natural... <br>  <br>  im going to assume natural if you are concerned about sex, which yeah you can! once it is inside it will naturally find the right spots to hit.<br>  <br>  if this was from an accident go to the doctor...|`|AA10283855	A bend is not uncommon - However, if it is painful then you need to see your doctor and be evaluated for the possibility of Peyronies Disease.

B8WEoAiKaa	You should go to the doctor anyway! <br>  Get tested on HPV and then you will know what it is!<br>  <br>  Genital HPV is usually spread through intimate, skin to skin, contact during sex.You can have the genital HPV virus for years and not have any sign of it. So it isn’t unusual to have a long term partner and then be told you have the virus after medical tests such as cervical screening. Many people then worry that their partner has been unfaithful, or will think they have been unfaithful. But finding out you have HPV doesn’t necessarily mean that you or your partner have been unfaithful. There is no way of knowing how long you have had the virus. It could be weeks, months or years.|`|98WKYtfwaa	It's an STI btw, not an STD.<br>  <br>  You highly doubt it's a STI because you've had the same partner for ages, but you recently got treated for chlamidya? <br>  <br>  You should go and get tested to be on the safe side. If your partner has a cold sore and have given you oral sex then you can contract it like that, but it would be called herpes and known as an STI. As for warts, they're only transferred via sexual intercourse, you don't know if it's skin tags or not that you've got, so get tested. <br>  <br>  I had skin tags down there before about 2years ago, i had about 4 and they were between my anus and vagina. I went to be tested and i was clear, the doc said it was just skin tags. I pulled them off and they've not came back since.

xxNkDS5raa	Hi, <br>  I blush easily as well, and sometimes my face turns red-ish without any reason. It's toned down as i've gotten older tho. It's not as if you have rosacea or any skin condition so you have nothing serious to worry about however i know how insecure it can make you feel. And knowing that your face is red makes you blush even more because you are embarassed. <br>  Try not to focus on it and it'll go down quickly. Wearing mineral makeup like bare minerals will work well, and as it's natural wont harm ur skin. Also clinique just launched a new mineral powder that is supposed to combat redness, along with  face creams and avene has day cream as well. They can be a bit pricey, but if it worries you that much it's worth it. <br>  Just remember that you're your worst critic and are going to notice it more than anyone else. <br>  good luck|`|XzAD49iraa	no not really...<br>  <br>  this also happens to me..<br>  <br>  but you can hide it.<br>  <br>  just lean your face against your hands and make it look like you are bored.<br>  <br>  it covers your face so you cant really see that your face is red.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|9WKVmOs1aa	im thinking there isnt any way to solve ur problem. it happens to me too, but im not nervous or anything either.... maybe you should try just not thinking about it, or think about it harder.|`|VlxBs9zyaa	dude,<br>  who cares?|`|WhPVEnk1aa	umm there is a list:<br>  <br>  1. wear a mask<br>  2. facepaint<br>  3. try blue<br>  4. dont laugh too much<br>  5. hope this helped|`|1rcnc56Waa	It simply turned red?<br>  <br>  Just curious, do you have a redish rash say shape of a butter fly on your face.<br>  An when exposed to cold does your hand turn multiple colors?<br>  Specifically blue white red<br>  <br>  In generally speaking, if its just redness, its just vasodilatation due to sympathetic pathway (anything that causes stimulation \ excitement \ anger - high emotional states)<br>  <br>  But if those 2 questions i asked were yes, id suggest you go see a doctor, other wise leave it, if it doesn't cause you any problems|`|djUMvICoaa	And is this a male instructor?

Don't let it overcome you.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	Go to your bathroom and close the door.  breathe deeply ... in ten times... out ten times...<br>  You are not going crazy and you are not going to have a heart attack.<br>  Just try to go somewhere in the house you can be alone for a minute, try to relax and breathe deeply.  Dont stare in the mirror, just sit and breathe.|`|xCCyGtv2aa	Hi, I have had panic attacks before.  The worst was while I was driving and had my 9 month old in the car, I was terrified I would die and crash and she would get hurt.<br>  <br>  What strategies have you learned from your therapist?  If you can, go into the next room, do some controlled breathing exercises, close your eyes, and remind yourself that you really are ok.  <br>  <br>  Can you give your therapist a call?  Have you talked with him (her) about the long-term effects your disorders have on your children?  Do they have someone to talk to?  I'm not saying that to make you feel bad, I just know I was concerned for my kids, too.  <br>  <br>  If you know how to take deep breaths, there is no way you will hyperventilate.  Even if your kids are in the same room, you can still breathe deeply, and even make a game out of it.  If you feel lightheaded, sit down, put your head between your knees for a minute.  <br>  <br>  I strongly recommend asking yoru therapist for strategies to ward off panic attacks, and for helping your children understand they are not responsible.|`|h2IpiWYIaa	Well, I am not a mom so I don't know how helpful this will be but I can tell you that my mom had panic attacks when I was growing up.  She would get really nervous sometimes, especially when driving or in crowds and they did not really stop until she started taking paxil.  She used to leave full grocery carts at the store and just take us home if it got to be too much for her.  Before she started taking paxil she would just breathe into a paper bag until she calmed down so you can try that if you are hyperventilating.  By the way, even though my mom had panic attacks that interfered with her everyday life she was a great mom and I couldn't ask for anyone better to have raised me.|`|2tTgBMGjaa	There's no quick fix.

The first thing you need to do is talk to a Dr.  I had panic attacks for quite some time, and really thought I was dying.  None of the doctors I went to could find anything wrong with me.  I just knew I had something wrong with my heart, and various other things.  Then one day, I went to a private family doctor, and I cried and told him about myself, and he said "Girl, it sounds to me like you're having panic attacks!"  And I said "That's exactly how it feels.....panic"........So he put me on Prozac, and also gave me some Xanax for sleep.  I had one other panic attack, a mild one, and I've never had another.  I know that it makes your life miserable and you think nobody even cares, but they do.  Talk to a good doctor.  Good luck to you.

When you feel anxious, that is when the panic attacks happen, for whatever reason that may get you anxious.<br>  You're online asking for an article, most of these are going to be.com's.<br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/panic-attacks/DS00338" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/panic-a...</a>|`|Wf5k8kYQaa	Anxiety disorders are a group of a whole bunch of disorders and panic disorder is a branch of it. so is Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)|`|O8RuSBAjaa	According to the DSM IV-TR - the diagnostic tool for mental health professionals, panic disorder falls under the umbrella of anxiety disorders. There are many types of anxiety disorder. A panic disorder is one type. As quoted in the DSM, "the essential feature of Panic Disorder is the presence of recurrent, unexpected panic attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack, worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioral change related to the attacks. " It goes on from there. <br>  There are a wide spectrum of anxiety disorders that are not panic disorder.Some of those include Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress disorder, acute stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder among others.

xXnFx6qLaa	I had all 4 of mine pulled at once.  It wasn't bad until I got two dry sockets in the lower jaw.  That was pretty painful.  The percocets just knocked me out so I didn't have to deal with the pain though.  I ended up being out of work for a week and a half because of the dry sockets.  <br>  <br>  My advice - don't drink through straws or smoke or anything like that until the doc says it's okay.  The dry sockets are what hurts badly.  The actual procedure doesn't really hurt at all.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	I really, really hurt after mine. But I also got dry sockets on the bottom and had to have them packed for a week or so. Do every thing the doctor says, even if it sounds stupid. Also get the pain meds the day before and fill the prescriptions. The last thing you want to do is wait at the pharmacy. <br>  Don't wait for the numbness to wear off before taking the meds either.

D4XWrwuaaa	Sounds like your ideas are working.<br>  <br>  Additionally you might want to eat yogurt once a day. I do this and have not had a cold in over two years. Regular yogurt works fine, and is what I did for the first year or so.<br>  <br>  Lately I have been drinking one DanActive for immue health each day and also eating an Dannon Activia yogurt to helo with digestive health. Most of your immune system is in your digestive tract, so keeping it healthy helps you not catch colds, viruses, etc.<br>  <br>  Not trying to plug Dannon here.

xCCyGtv2aa	I can relate to a lot of what you wrote.  Yes, the behaviors you describe are clear examples of emotional abuse.  It is normal for you to love your parents, and on some level they do love you, too.  But it sounds like they do not understand how to love you in a healthy way.  They seem to be having trouble understanding that you are a separate person, not a part of them.  They use fear, obligation, and guilt to manipulate you (some people refer to this trio as FOG).<br>  <br>  I am not surprised in the slightest to hear that you have developed bulimia and depression.  These are very common responses for children with emotionally abusive parents.  I strongly urge you to seek help from a licensed therapist.  Bulimia is a serious disease, and you will need help to overcome it.  A good therapist will also be able to help you sort through all your parents' behaviors and teach you valuable tools for dealing with the negative ones.<br>  <br>  You will never be able to fix your relationship with your parents on your own, because you are not the reason it is broken.  To me, it sounds like they have some qualities in common with some of the Cluster B personality disorders.  You may want to do some research into Borderline Personality Disorder or Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  I will include a book list for you at the bottom. <br>  <br>  Whatever the case, please seek help.  It sounds like you have been feeling guilty and punishing yourself for being unable to live up to their impossible standard.  Your therapist will be able to teach you valuable skills that your parents weren't able to teach you.  Parents shape who their children are.  Recognizing this is not the same thing as blaming them for all of your problems.  Your therapist will be able to help you sort through all these feelings, and to understand what your roles and responsibilities are in your recovery.<br>  <br>  Hang in there, honey.  You're not crazy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Wikipedia article on PDs:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality...</a><br>  <br>  BookRecs:<br>  "Toxic Parents" and "Emotional Blackmail" by Susan Forward, Ph.D.<br>  <br>  and, if you or your therapist suspects Borderline or Narcissistic PDs in your parents, these are a good place to start:<br>  <br>  (BPD) <br>  "Surviving a Borderline Parent" by  Kimberlee Roth and Freda Friedman<br>  <br>  (You might also check out www.bpdcentral.com .

You need to have a mediator though (you know someone who isn't on anyone's side). They need to know how you feel. You are not going to get past this until you do this. Try counseling (if they will do it) If they love you they will listen to your concerns. Good luck.|`|p3xohPUAaa	sweetie i can wholeheartedly relate. My mother has bpd as well she refcuses to acknowledge it even when i show her articles. She would claim she listened in on my conversations and invaded my privacy(up until i left my 2 yr college for my four yr) claiming she was trying to keep me from getting pregnant. I didnt have sex until i was 23 with my then fiance. Talking to them wont help because they wont see it. The best thing to do is to try to finish college(fafsa and loans should help) get a job move out for good(sounds like you did that one) and move on. You cant change them. After you get out for good keep limited contact with them. Visit them but if they start with their controlling ways again just say "well im gonna let yall get back to what you were doing im going home". If they control over the phone say "well my dinner is about to burn ill call u back later". Im so sorry im still dealing with my mother im in my 20s live at home until i can work the economy is horrible so i might be a while so dont lose heart.
AA11944397	I am anemic as well, and those vitamins suck!

FkXt4XLvaa	You actually have a ton of possibilities here.<br>  <br>  FIRST, it could be an allergic reaction to something.<br>  <br>  Start off by no longer using scented soaps, lotions, oils, and even shampoos and conditioners (as they run down your body when they are rinsed off). Deoderants and colognes can affect you as well. Even if you don't break out in the exact area where something is placed, it could still be an allergic reaction. When I have an allergic reaction to a soap, I get rashes on my back but nowhere else. You will need to do this for at least a week to see if it has any effect. Unscented baby powder or corn starch will help to ease the itch as it heals.<br>  <br>  It could also be your laundry detergent or fabric softener. If it's a strong kind like Gain or Tide or heavily scented, try double rinsing your laundry or buy a bottle of any clear kind (like All Free & Clear) and use that for at least a month (as all your other laundry will still have the detergent's remnants in it too) and see if that helps.<br>  <br>  Also, with laundry, don't wear the same outfit over and over again without washing it first even if it doesn't smell. Body oils and remnants of colognes or even scents from where you had been will stay on the clothes and could be affecting your skin. <br>  <br>  And always shower after a workout. If you walk or jog but don't sweat much, you still need to at least wipe off and change your clothes. Oddly and grossly, there are people who don't do this and it's not a good habit.<br>  <br>  SECOND, it could be a food allergy so try deleting certain foods from your diet. Not all food allergies show up in the form of vomiting, dizziness, headaches, or diarrhea. Try taking out a few things for about a week and see if that makes a difference. If not, try a different few things.<br>  <br>  THIRD, if you are taking medications, you could have an intolerance or allergy to those. Even some OTC products or supplements can cause negative reactions in some people. If they are not necessary for you to be taking, cut them out. Talk to a doctor about the possibility of an allergy to the medication. He could either lower the dose or get you a different prescription if it is something you still need to take.<br>  <br>  FOURTH...Dry skin can get rashy too. If it's flaky in areas or the marks of your scratches stay apparent for a while, it could be dry skin. As long as you have ruled out a reaction to lotions and soaps, try showering or bathing with something less abrasive and more soothing. Aveeno products and anything with oatmeal will soothe itchy skin.<br>  <br>  Try drinking more water as well. WATER. Not just liquids. Water will help to flush anything out of your system that could be causing the irritation and will keep your body cleansed and clean and your skin moisturized.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, you should see a dermatologist if you can and talk with him/her about the severity, length of time you have the rashes, when it started, if it ever seems to go away, all of that.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	there are several possibilites, the first one the occurs to me is dehydration, if you don't drink at least two liters of water a day, you are not drinking enough, this will dry the skin and make it itch and can cause rashes.  The second thing is allergy, perhaps the soap you use, or the laundry detergent or fabric softener you use is one you are allergic to.<br>  Try to determine if anything has changed recently in your environment to figure out what you may be allergic to.<br>  In the meantime, Gold Bond medicated lotion, available without prescription is good for controlling itching.|`|wKLZobsDaa	dry skin prehaps? or chicken pox? check wit a dr.!
oD3DBOBfaa	You might have carried some of the bed bugs on your clothes. Wash them with HOT water. <br>  <br>  And tell your BF to wash his bedding items with HOT water as well. <br>  <br>  Remember: bed bugs cannot live with the heat over 120 degrees. So I also recommend him or you using a steam cleaner on the mattress as well. <br>  <br>  Then preferably apply bedbugpowder on the mattress from the site below. The powder is 100% organic and is safe to humans and animals. Sprays or foggers don't work unless you use them directly on the actual bed bugs.<br>  <br>  And don't scratch the bites on you.

FORUjwveaa	Now look at those celebrities a year or 2 from now. Most of them don't make it far in marriage. Don't try to live by celebrity standards. Their lives are very different from every day people. Hardly ever do any of em stay married.<br>  <br>  Take it from a guy. We LOVE curves. My wife keeps talkin about being skinny, or she'll point out walking sticks on TV and tell me she wants to look like them. And my wife is absolutely hot. I don't know where you women get the idea from that guys want a skinny woman.<br>  <br>  Most of us don't want to put our arms around a woman and feel bones poking us. Nor do we want to look at a woman and see the same shape no matter what angle we're looking at em. We like curves. But just like there's such a thing as too skinny there is also such a thing as too...well curvey. :) But 9 out of 10 women i've known to complain about being too big were not even close to being big.<br>  <br>  In the end it's all up to you. Because if you don't love the way you look it will be impossible for anyone else to love it either. I know that sounds like a cliche line. But i've learned that it truly does apply.<br>  <br>  And don't worry about not having a boyfriend right now. If someone really wants to be with you they're not going to put all the weight of their decision on your looks anyway. It's a big part of it yeah. But it's not a deal breaker. And trust me. If a guy is dating you for your looks only. You probably don't want him anyway.|`|TAmMzRIfaa	This is retarded. Fats girls do not equal unlikable. Even though a thin pretty girl would leave a better first impression, what matters most is that you are nice. I mean who on earth would want a girl who is pretty but is mean and shallow? Also, no matter how unpretty you look/feel, there's always people who will appreciate you and might even think you're pretty. Well, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.<br>  Have more confidence. You're not overweight.<br>  Smile and be happy. (:|`|mzFulBFFaa	Did you know that 1 out of 10 men voted for a skinny girl? that was in a poll.

9cTAi7waaa	your prolly young, and just trying to find yourself. My advice would be to start up a gym membership. That way you can tone your body and stay healthy at the same time. You dont want to be super skinny like models. Thats not attractive. Ask any man. A guy likes a girl in shape but with a little meat and curves. You dont want to look like a stick figure when you take off your clothes. Unattractive. Just tone your body and you should feel better about yourself. Dont worry about numbers, theyre just numbers. Meaningless. Muscles weighs more than fat btw...|`|6U6b14ySaa	DO NOT WORRY YOU WILL BE THIN WITH IN TWO MONTH IF U REGULARLY PRACTICE KAPAL BHATI PRANAYAM.YOUR EATING HABITS WILL ALSO BE GET CONTROLLED AUTOMATICALLY|`|VS8mactUaa	well maybe it is full blown ocd, I have ocd I was diagnosed when I was 9, its more common than you think, get a referral from your family doctor to be evaluated, if it is ocd then there are thing you can do and take to keep it under control and they do work I wish you all the best of Luck!
fXjlWQO6aa	you could possibly have keratosis pilaris. try Earth Theraputic Intensive Heel Repair lotion. i swear to you it makes the bumps go right away in about two days. you could try any other lotion with Alpha Hydroxy Acid in it, but i recommend this strongly. just use alot on your arms. don't rub it all the way in. just rub it so it covers your arm and let it soak in. this is what i do and if you have keratosis, i promise you will see improvement. if you don't see improvement in the bumps, then it's not keratosis.<br>  if it's not, try flea medication for your dog. that's also a possibililty. <br>  hope this helped :]|`|t44168wJaa	its probably fleas they usually bite at night just washing the dog won't kill the fleas you should go buy the medicine used to kill fleas|`|nrTDOs6aaa	Are you sure its not from the dog?

Exercise is an awesome way to convert negative energy into positive energy. And eat right! Don't eat  a bunch of junk food because, as you are finding out, it doesn't make you feel better...it makes you feel worse. Also, seek God. He loves you and will forgive you if you ask him and will help you forgive yourself for whatever it is in your life that you need help with.<br>  God bless|`|sys48nMIaa	Leave the past behind you, try to make for a better future.

That's your best bet. Your eating junk food because your trying to fill a hole inside that cannot be filled. You need to accept the mistakes you've made. Acceptance is the first step to moving on.<br>  Also, you might want to consider some spiritual guidance.<br>  You should check into Mclean Bible Church. If you don't live in Virginia, you can watch the sermon's online. That church is deep and they know what they're talking about. I'm sure they can help you get through your problems with faith and Christ.|`|IvCsdcV7aa	I think that you should let go of all the things that happened in the past. It will help.

Rk46lIBwaa	1) Forget the concept of fast or you are probably doomed to fail totally.<br>  2) Eat less<br>  3) Do much more exercise|`|a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	Step 1: Find out what your basal metabolic rate is. Go to <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off-permanently.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weigh...</a> <br>  Ignore the advertisements there. This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the longest period of time while exercising. You have two targets a fat burn zone and an cardiovascular zone. The fat burn is usually 60% of your maximum an d is easier to achieve and maintain and if your goal is weight loss this is where you want to be. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the<br>  Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.<br>  <br>  Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance what you eat(equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible) . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/se...</a><br>  This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it won’t matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight. Great ideas for people on the go are: South Beach Raisin Granola Bar, Snickers Marathon Multi-Grain Crunch(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle), Snickers Marathon Protein Caramel Nut Rush(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle)<br>  <br>  Step 5: Balance! In what you eat. Make sure that you are eating Protein, Carbs, and Fiber in every meal. A great way to make sure you get the protein and fiber is Kelloggs Protein Water. It has only 30 calories but gives you 5g protein and 5g fiber for 20z. Go to Wal-mart they sell a 10 pack of the powder for ~$5.50. That way when you are eating a high carb food for a snak or meal you can still get the balance. <br>  <br>  Step 6: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.<br>  <br>  Step 7(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits<br>  around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).<br>  <br>  Step 8: Sleep, Never underestimate the power of a goodnight sleep. Will power can crumble in a second if your going through your day tired. You end up with a diminished sense of self control and tend to “give in” to temptation.<br>  <br>  Step 9: Find a distraction. Read a book, Ride a bike, Play a game. Whatever takes your mind off of food, do it. You will need something that you can turn to in a moment of weakness. Something that will distract you for a half an hour so that your will can reassert itself and help you to make a rational decision.|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	Aerobic exercise, something that exerts the body for a period of time conccentrating on increased heart rate and breathing rather than strength.<br>  <br>  a good way is an exercise bike.  Benefits are you don't have to go out and you can listen to music etc whilst using it.  Drawbacks are that it takes up room and has to be purchased, do you have a friend or relative who has an unused one you could borrow or rent?  <br>  <br>  you need to aim for duration of exercise as opposed to intensity, so if you can keep going longer it's better than faster.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you can rent an exercise bike, so if you get sick of it it can go back and you aren't stuck with it.|`|XAAF7R23aa	you have to lose it slowly and steadily over a period of time, anything other than that is not feasible.

5as6Dsusaa	I don't think you were fired, I work as a sub too I mostly go to middle schools, my first day was in elementary and I don't think I'm going back so I stick to middle school. The way that secretary talked to you was very rude. Unless you get a call from the district that hired you then you have nothing to worry about. Go back when it's time to work and if that's a big IF you were fired they would let you know. Some people have a jealousy problem or just cause they don't like you they are rude. Or if you are unsure call the district, Human resources and let them know what happened they would give you a more definite answer. Also it could be that you just won't go back to that particular school, i know that they can do that, you have other schools to choose from, if they don't call you for that one no biggie but go for the others that do call you for. Good Luck!|`|ZZVNlXdxaa	There is a good chance you have.<br>  If its been a couple days since when they said she would call you then she might not.<br>  Kids are hard to be assertive with....i really would like to be a kindergarten teacher but i get annoyed very easily and have an anger counselor so that might not be the best idea :)|`|JwnHKTabaa	You probably lost it.|`|OgTvqmJ9aa	This is in diet and fitness..?

I have been told it could be tomorrow or 5 years from now until I would need dialysis or transplant.  I know someone that went almost 10 years before dialysis. Once she goes on dialysis she can live up over 20 years possibly, although the average is around 10 years.  <br>  She really needs to start taking managing her health better and I am guessing that you will also help your mom.  There is a strict diet called the renal diet on www.davita.com   It is awesome and I recommend it. This was recommended by my dietician that follows me closely at MUSC.<br>  <br>  I know you said transplant wasn't an option, but have you talked to a transplant team?  I am only 37 and have Sjogrens Syndrome.  I REALLY thought there was no way I would qualify for a transplant, but I did.<br>  <br>  Make sure she goes to her regular follow up appointments with the kidney Doc and get that diabetes and whatever other health issues she may be having under control.  She will have good days and bad days.  Many thoughts going out your way during this transition!
BwJOeHDEaa	the only thing that you can do is to exfoliate a few times a week, washing your face compulsively wont help the problem, its only going to make your face dry, red, flakey, and probably peel, umm..proactive works pretty good, i used it and it workd well for me, also try a mask, like a biore or something like that..and st ives medicated face scrub...<br>  also give yourself a mini-facial 2 or 3 times a week, exfoliate your face, then take a super hot wet washcloth, or you can head over steam to open your pores, let it sit..or steam..for a few minutes, then wash your face like normal, and rinse it with cold water..it will help seal your pores, tehn moisturize..but not too much or it will make your face shiney..and make sure that your moisturizer is non-comodegenic so that it wont clog your pores further!<br>  <br>  good luck, i have monster pores too|`|b7vdkAAIaa	dr. bronners soap and a loofa - keep your face clean - obsessively, like, clean your face at least 3000 times a day or so - and your hands - and everything in your house - everything is dirty... so dirty

I'm not saying you are. I just mentioned it for just-so-you-know purpose.<br>  <br>  you might be suffering from vitamin deficiency and even if you eat a lot of food (which you do not) you could still suffer from this situation. multivitamins are good (those one-a-day things), a daily doze of vit. c and b12 could also do you good.<br>  <br>  it might be a good idea too, to see a doctor. and as far as the dentures are concerned, it takes time to get used to it.

It's really bad for your health to only eat one meal a day.<br>  <br>  You should be aiming to eat 4-6 times a day, or every three hours. It doesn't have to be a big meal, but it does have to be good quality.<br>  <br>  Concentrating on only sugary or fatty foods isn't going to help, ironcially. Sugar and fat are both metabolised (used up) by your body quicker than any other food source. Also you may end up with other health problems (blood pressure, diabetes, colesterhol etc) if you eat too much of this type of food.<br>  <br>  Stick to eating regular, small, healthy meals with lots of good carbohydrates, protein and nutrients. So for example, pasta with tuna, rice and chicken, etc. Eat lots of fruit and veg too and drink plenty of water.<br>  <br>  I would also consider taking a vitamin supplement to help you out whilst you put weight back on.<br>  <br>  The last, and most important thing to say is that your BMI (body mass index) works out at 19.9 - which is very much a NORMAL weight for your height. So don't worry so much!

czXaUPIlaa	When you meditate, do you attempt to control your breath? If so, this effort may have produced the disoriented feelings.<br>  <br>  When people begin Zen meditation, I recommend that they simply breathe normally. After some experience, practitioners can begin slowing the breath in specific ways.<br>  <br>  If you're breathing normally but still feel disoriented, then your consciousness may simply be responding to your intention to study the mind. <br>  <br>  Although we may have the desire to understand ourselves better, the mind sometimes resists our intention. So the disorientation may have appeared because you're doing something new and uncomfortable. If this is the case, then all you have to do is persist - keep doing your meditation practice.<br>  <br>  As people settle into meditation practice, all kinds of feelings will appear - from boredom to delight, from anxiety to calm stability. None of these feelings have any reality - they're just passing mental states that offer no firm footing for our life. Just continue practicing and your life will inevitably change.<br>  <br>  Here's a highly-recommended, short video on how to do Zen meditation. Perhaps this will help you:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csyCrcpDs58" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csyCrcpDs...</a>|`|y8DLyE5raa	Make sure you're breathing in and out in a slow manner.

ZqMzjh5Taa	Hi,<br>  Well I was overweight and decided that I needed to lose weight and off I went on to a diet. I had then realised for me to keep those pounds of forever I am going to have change my lifestyle. I believe when trying to lose weight you never stop eating a type of food. Dont ever stop eating carbs or wteva. You should eat everything but in great limit. Stop eating str8 away when u feel u can work without more food. <br>  Cakes, tea with sugar, fizzy drinks, crisps, biscuits all is a no no. <br>  Eat fruits and vegetables but remember again eat in a limit. Try to eat fruits that may be low in sugar such as strawberries. Dry fruit is also really good especially prunes. <br>  During meal times you can have a jacket potato (no cheese), Fish and chips (oven cooked), Vegetables, Chicken (preferably cooked in the oven) oven chips. Really anything as long as you cook it in the healthy way. <br>  When cooking only use olive oil. <br>  Water and non-sugar and non-fizzy juices are perfect. Try and have green tea if you can once in a while to boost your metabolism. <br>  Walking is really important. Get of a bus stop earlier and walk the rest. Stop taking the car to work and walk to the bus stop. Anything that will push you to walk. <br>  Another really good thing is POPCORN! When u want a snack make popcorn. No butter and a titchy bit of salt with 1 tbs of oil. Preferably air-popped but not every1 has the machine to do that. Dont ever have popcorn at the cinemas.<br>  Ok I can go on forever lol. Its just a matter of changing your lifestyle. <br>  I have been making all these small changes and I am no longer overweight and look so much better :)|`|MlhiDi8paa	Try this diet, you'l lose like 4kg's in 3 days!<br>  Try it 3 days on 4 days off.<br>  It really works, no foolin around.<br>  <a href="http://www.5fm.co.za/djs/Fresh/blog/the-diet" rel="nofollow">http://www.5fm.co.za/djs/Fresh/blog/the-...</a>|`|Hrky2Tigaa	i found the information here|`|wGTisY1aaa	Try these good nutrition meals.

There is an also fresh squeeze of lime and lemon that takes the food to a tropical place. Don’t be afraid to mix and match your dishes as long as you stay within your counts for that meal and for that day. Remember that you need to eat for what you have coming up not for what you have already done. Say if you know you are going to take a nap after a meal then don’t eat so many carbs because you will not be burning them off.
Y6YrRo7Uaa	There are newer whiteners with peroxide that dont harm the enamel of your teeth. ALL o-t-c whiteners are temporary. If you want it to last you have to get the whitening treatment from the dentist's office that runs about $2,000. I have tried them all, and the best over the counter one is the new rembrant system. It is a two hour whitening kit, and toothpaste, and mouthwash. The tooth paste leaves a nasty aftertaste, and it takes a while to get used to the amount of peroxide, but it literally was really  noticeable by the third day, and the mouthwash really does smooth out any roughness in the enamel of your teeth.
E64juLwJaa	And this is in men's health why?<br>  Planets.|`|v92aRylQaa	I would also like to know.|`|EVHr4VpCaa	Yes, six years ago.  I was laid off when my company downsized.  It was one of the most unpleasant periods of my life.  It was a real 'punch in the face' for me psychologically.<br>  <br>  The first thing to remember is that being unemployed does not diminish your worth as a person.  <br>  <br>  Second, finding a full time job is a full time job.  I talked to as many people as I could.  I never asked anyone for a job, but rather asked for information, advice, contacts.  <br>  <br>  I was unemployed for 7 months but found a job that is so much better.

You'd be lucky if it was just on your lower back and easier for the surgeon to drain and get rid of. It can be very painful and not noticed until has swollen then not being able to move as though your back ceases up when walks. <br>  <br>  Its excruciatingly painful but the sooner get it checked out the better. The later you leave it theres the chance of having a big chunk taken out as it'll have gotten larger and having more puss to drain. Will need to have it checked at the walk-in-centre who can then check it and if so would need to be referred to a hospital to get removed. Good Luck!|`|5FS8d8p1aa	Hey ecetwo!<br>  <br>  Just a quick reply.  If your Hemorrhoids are too bad you should see a doctor. There are some good resources around to help you out.

NPpalf1Gaa	I'm an adult who's had braces.. unfortunatley I had them on the 3rd grade all the way up to 8th grade. Then I didn't wear my retainer and now have them on again as a 19 year old freshman in college. But that's my own fault so if you do get braces, be sure to do every single little thing the dentist tells you to do and more to ensure you get them off at the time they say you will. If you don't, the procedure could last way longer than expected. <br>  It shouldn't have taken 5 years for braces like it did for me, that is why when selecting a dentist you want to read reviews on his or her performance, and if you can find out what school they studied for and you generally over all want to have a good connection with the office and the other dentists in the building, not just the main doctor. If you go in there and their telling you 6 moths, then you go in there and their telling you 2 years.. that sounds a little faulty to me. If you can, see another dentist and get a second opinion. Don't make the same mistake I did!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|V2BlnZf0aa	I wore upper and lower braces for a year and retainer at night.  Best thing I ever did.  I had them last year and I was 38.  Mine cost ￡2800.  I was expecting them to be on for 2 years and it goes in a flash.  Good luck.
AA10299265	Yes, it's called "double diabetes" or type 3. It is most definitely possible for a type one to develop insulin resistance.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Ask a doctor...|`|8asG4WCwaa	YES!<br>  <br>  It i possible for a type 1 diabetic to develop insulin resistance (type 2).

In these cases your body gets less insulin than it needs. Various medications help to increase the amount of insulin your body can absorb and these are usually tablet-based.<br>  <br>  Type 1 diabetes is where the pancreas has stopped working (actually it's where the islets of Langerhans have stopped working, but lets keep this simple). In this case your body produces no insulin at all. You cannot effectively take insulin as a medication in any other form than insulin injections (this is changing slowly and will be untrue in a few years time I hope) so Type 1s and some Type 2s are required to have injections.<br>  <br>  I hope this clears things up for you.<br>  <br>  |\/|artin<br>  <br>  P.S. There is no such thing as a stupid question, merely stupid people who don't ask.|`|pRF5LLloaa	No.  They are different diseases, and Type 1 Diabetics DO NOT become Type 2.<br>  <br>  On the otherr hand, Type 2 Diabetics frequently become Type 1 Diabetics !<br>  <br>  Type 1 Diabetes is casued by a failure of the pancreas.  We don't fully understand all the reason WHY this happens, but when it does you get VERY sick.  If you do not get the necessary treaement (insulin shots) then you will die.  Once you become Type 1 Diabetic, you will be a Type 1 Diabetic for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Type 2 Diabetes is caused from an "overworked" pancreas.  this happens when you gain too much weight.  Type 2 Diabetes can be controlled by eating a proper diet free from sugar and low in starches.  Certain medications may also be necessary.<br>  <br>  it is VERy important that the Type 2 Diabetic get LOTS more exercise, and LOSE THAT EXTRA WEIGHT!<br>  <br>  If the Type 2 Diabetic does not properly control the diesase through  diet and exercise, eventually the pancreas will "give up", and the patient becomes a Type 1 Diabetic, needing insulin shots.<br>  <br>  Note that there is NO CURE for Diabetes. Both types will need to fight the disease for the rest of their life.<br>  <br>  And there are NO "insulin pills".  Insulin is destroyed by stomach juices, so cannot be taken by mouth.  Injections are the ONLYway to get insulin.|`|8bQkJ2Zjaa	You people are crazy<br>  <br>  NO. There is no way.

That is probably why he became defensive. Some kids are just naturally hyper. If his school work is not suffering and he teachers and his parents don't think he has a problem then there is nothing you can do but just deal with the fact, that is the way he is. But if they do think he has a problem then the first step is consulting his doctor an then they will point him in the right direction for proper diagnosing.|`|g86xqNHfaa	Only a dr can diagnose ADHD  .What do his parents think?

6UBSUzUIaa	Completely! It is an injection that has 3 mths of hormones in it, that your body gets at one time and then tries to control them. I was on the depo shot for one year. It made me gain a large amount of weight, stress/anxiety, complete body break-out, and then i had spotting for three months straight. This was after my first shot. Then after my second, I stopped my period for 3 years. I couldn't not conceive until 5 years. I spoke with another doctor than the ***** that prescribed this to me, and he told me that when the first doctor noticed my symptoms, he should have never given it to me again. He said that when your body receives a large amount of hormones it puts your eggs on a kind of "freeze" and it takes them a while to jump start again. My advice would be not to take, because I don't know anyone that has taken it and has not had any adverse affects.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|eHZCRfm2aa	i"m on it and it seems to be fine|`|MXRXG62oaa	yep, my friend got it and shes gained so much weight already, she's got food cravings all the time and constantly tired.<br>  <br>  i'll take my period, thanks !|`|fypgDK53aa	I was on it for six years, and while I was a poster child and loved it, especially for the first few years, now being off for nearly five months, I feel very differently about it. Side effects that I didn't know I had have disappeared, and I just feel "better" than I have for a number of years.<br>  <br>  That being said, I was well aware of the risks associated with the drug, it's potential side effects, benefits and dangers. I could have recited the entire monograph- I just didn't necessarily see the preciptious changes in my health as side effects, which they were. <br>  <br>  I don't know that it's any more dangerous than any other hormonal contraceptive. It works very well for some women, and not so well with others. Some women experience debillitating side effects and others have no side effects and love the safety and control it gives them over their own fertility. Even the problem with calcium depletion can be managed.<br>  <br>  There are risks associated with ALL drugs, and I believe that it is the lack of education, and self-education before taking ANY drug is what is dangerous. Unfortunately, many people forget that hormonal contraception is a DRUG, and one that changes your physiology greatly. Just because it has the benefit of preventing pregnancy doesn't warrant it to be treated as any less a health concern.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|3d1XRIzkaa	To loose weight, Quit drinking soda pop, even diet soda.

The average Japanese man walks 4 miles a day.<br>  <br>  E.g. <br>  Walk to and around the train station (0.5 miles)<br>  Walk to work from the train station (0.5 miles)<br>  Walk to lunch (0.25 miles)<br>  Walk back from lunch (0.25 miles)<br>  Walk to and around the train station (0.5 miles)<br>  Walk to the gym (0.25 miles)<br>  Walk home from the gym (0.5 miles)<br>  Walk to the train station to meet friends for dinner.... you get the idea.<br>  <br>  Essentially the Japanese population WALKS everywhere because it costs a small fortune to own a car and the traffic is miserable.  To park it costs $800 a month.  The emissions testing is around $1000 and a driver's license costs around $2500 with testing.<br>  <br>  The Japanese people have a choice... stay slender and walk everywhere (since most things are close by), or live like an American, spend $10,000  a year just to own a tiny car.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	No it has been suggested to increase the metabolism by 10-30 calories each day by dinking at least three cups, so if it is true it is a very small difference.

TdqeC0vmaa	A personality disorder is when someone thinks, believes, perceives, and interacts with reality in a set pattern of incorrect and often maladaptive ways. <br>  <br>  They originate from combination of brain susceptibility and environment.<br>  <br>  You can do some with self help. <br>  Learning all you can about the specific diagnosis and its symptoms.<br>  Then be conscious of ones self learning to recognize these symptoms and how they play out in yourself. <br>  Then consciously monitoring your own beliefs, perceptions, reactions, and behaviors for instances of symptomology. <br>  Learning to keep these in check to the best of your ability.
xCCyGtv2aa	A person with a personality disorder has difficulty understanding relationships according to the norms in his culture.  The wikipedia article will give you the definitions of personality disorders according to the DSM-IV, which is the guide mental health professionals use to make a  diagnosis.<br>  <br>  There are three basic categories of PDs.  If you have been diagnosed with a personality disorder, it means you will need to continue seeking professional help in order to learn the tools you need to function happily in society.  Sometimes this is hard to do, because for many people with PDs, to seek help means admitting there may be something wrong with them at their core.  However, PD generally only means that a person hasn't learned healthy ways of dealing with emotional pain yet.  It doesn't mean they are "bad".<br>  <br>  If you have been diagnosed with a personality disorder, please continue the therapy prescribed by your caregiver.  If someone you know or love has been given a diagnosis, you may want to seek therapy for yourself in order to learn strategies for dealing with their undesirable behaviors, in order to help both of you.|`|mI4lrKdHaa	It means you have a personality disorder.

Rk46lIBwaa	Salt mouthwashes are both unhelpful and potentially dangerous.<br>  <br>  The most common type of mouth ulcers are called 'apthous' ulcers. They are probably viral.

Most of all, though, I would recommend talking to your doctor the next chance you get, and that will be the most help of all, but until then, I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)<br>  <br>  Does This Sound Like You?<br>  Do you feel trapped in a pattern of unwanted and upsetting thoughts? Do you feel that you have to do the same things over and over again for no good reason? Do any of these apply to you?:<br>  ? Upsetting thoughts or images enter my mind again and again.<br>  ? I feel like I can’t stop these thoughts or images, even though I want to.<br>  ? I have a hard time stopping myself from doing things again and again, such as counting, checking on things, washing my hands, rearranging objects, doing things until it right, or collecting useless objects.<br>  ? I worry a lot about terrible things that could happen if I’m not careful. I have unwanted urges to hurt someone but I never know I never would.<br>  <br>  If any of these apply to you, you may have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).<br>  <br>  What is OCD?<br>  OCD is a real illness that can be treated with medicine and therapy. If you have OCD, you have repeated, upsetting thoughts. You do the same thing over and over againto make the thoughts go away, and you feel as if you can’t control these thoughts or actions. The upsetting thoughts and images are called obsessions- examples include a fear of germs, a fear of being hurt, a fear of hurting others, and disturbing thoughts. The actions you take over and over again to make the thoughts go away are called compulsions- examples of these repeated actions include counting, cleaning, and checking on things.<br>   Many people with OCD know that their actions aren’t normal, and they may try to hide their problem from family and friends. Some people with OCD may have trouble keeping their job and friends because of their actions.  <br>  <br>  When Does OCD Start, and How Long Does It Last?<br>  For many people, OCD starts when they’re a child or teenager, and if they don’t get help, the condition can last for a lifetime. OCD may run in families. <br>  <br>  <br>  Are You the Only One with This Illness?<br>  No, you’re not alone. In any year, 3.3 million Americans have OCD.<br>  What Can You Do to Help Yourself?<br>  Talk to your doctor about your unwanted thoughts, fears, and repeated actions. Tell him or her if these thoughts and repeated actions keep you from doing everyday things and living your life. Explain how you feel, and ask your doctor for a checkup to ensure that you don’t have some other illness.
Ah8qnPd1aa	well ill give you advice that i always get. because honestly i feel everything on your list. sometimes i dont even know why im sad i just know that i hate where im in right now in life. i hate the college im at. i hate everything thats happened to me. i just want to quit. but i guess thats not the best idea. <br>  the truth is i dont really follow any of this which is why im still feeling the same way as you. i know thats not really encouraging but i want to be honest with you.<br>  a lot of people have told me that i need to pray. i dont know if your a christian or what your faith is but i know that a lot of people go through the same thing we go through and medicine may help some people but i guess the power of prayer is a lot more effective. every so often when im reading the bible and praying i experience peace like i havent felt before. its a suggestion. im not forcing anything on you. and im in no position to do that.<br>  i guess you should tell your parents.they might be able to get you a therapist who can help. <br>  like the other person said, try to play a sport. itll help big time. i know in high school being on a team helped me make friends and fit in better than anything else. <br>  take care. hope this helps. at least i guess you could take comfort in that a lot of us are in the same postion as you.|`|qUDas0R4aa	take up a hobby, like playing a musical instrument or start a coin collection or something, something to get your mind off things|`|8bI3BIRJaa	Hey.

Is she going in for treatments such as Remicade infusions, humira shots, etc. <br>  <br>  If you check out the Crohn's & Colitis foundation's site, you can find all of the information you need regarding how it's treated, the newest treatments--the above mentioned as well as Entocort, 6MP, Imuran, and Methotrexate. They also have a  live chat and a hotline run by healthcare experts during the week as well as an open forum where you can post questions to others who have crohn's or ulcerative colitis.<br>  <br>  Definitely look into in order to educate yourself and be sure to share what you've learned with your friend.  good luck to you both.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	"The life expectancy of those with Crohn's disease and /or colitis is normal.

Because by coughing your muscles contract and push downwards. <br>  <br>  Just a thought.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	Hon, if you seriously cannot urinate, you need to go to urgent care or A&E now.

sTdlAMv7aa	I don't have any information suggesting irritable bowel syndrome could contribute to infertility.  Theoretically, someone with poor digestion & absorption might find decreased hormone production (since many hormones are made from amino acids or cholesterol), but I haven't read about that- yet.  If the blood tests reveal your partner's testosterone levels are low, this may account for insufficient sperm production.  A semen analysis would show how his sperm is being affected (less than 20,000,000 is considered a low sperm count).<br>  <br>  Undescended testes may likewise result in infertility, but since you mention he had one that fully descended, this might only result in decreased sperm production.  Lots of men with low sperm counts still sire children.  Chicken pox may likewise affect fertility in men (temporarily due to fever, or longer term if inflammation of the testes [orchitis] occurs), but generally mumps are considered more likely to result in infertility.  It may take about 3 months to produce sperm unaffected by the fever during chickenpox.

oYJEFQWwaa	Yes, it's true. The active ingredient, mitragynine, is similar in chemical structure to morphine and other opiate drugs. Kratom produces a high that many compare to the effects of Percocet or Lortab. Unfortunately, this means Kratom can also be addictive when abused, and can cause withdrawal of the morphine-type upon cessation after an extended period of use.<br>  <br>  Poppy pod tea is also a natural, legal way to enjoy the effects of opiates. All the warnings that go with Kratom also go with Poppy pod tea. Be careful of overdosing, too. Several people have DIED from drinking too much poppy tea. I think the risk would be much less when it concerns Kratom, but better safe than sorry...<br>  <br>  Read more about both here: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.erowid.org/plants/kratom/kratom.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.erowid.org/plants/kratom/krat...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.erowid.org/plants/poppy/poppy.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.erowid.org/plants/poppy/poppy...</a><br>  <br>  That should give you all the information you could ever want to know about virtually ANY substance!|`|D6GMdAgmaa	Firstly, I think you also want to ask anything else and I would like to tell you that Kratom's usage gives a soothing effect.<br>  <br>  Kratom is a medicinal leaf, harvested from the a large tree native to Southeast Asia. <br>  <br>  Its botanical name is Mitragyna Speciosa. Kratom is in the same family as the coffee tree. The leaves have been used as a herbal drug in Southeast Asia since times immemorial. <br>  <br>  It is often used in folk medicine as a stimulant, sedative, recreational drug, pain killer and much more.<br>  <br>  All in all, its medicinal properties are no secret and people all over the world now acknowledge this fact.

ufgv7oTjaa	There are a LOT of companies that are selling Acai berry products, so you wouldn't be the only one and the market would be rather competitive right now... it's a rather big fad product on the market. If you're talking about the whole berries, you'd have a harder time making a profit because the berries don't last very long so they would practically have to be overnighted to get to the store in enough time and you'd have to have people buy them within a couple days before they start looking bad.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to do this, you'd have to charge a very high price just to cover the shipping and quick sale, plus the customer would have to wait for their product (which most people in the U.S. wouldn't want to do). Most people would just want to buy some capsules, dehydrated berries, or properly prepared juice than to pay a really high price for the same thing. Good luck if you think you can get people to buy it, though!|`|3DqNexwkaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was   <a href="http://theweightlossplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://theweightlossplace.com</a> -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.

sTdlAMv7aa	It's not simply testosterone.  One can have moderate to high testosterone with & still be relatively hairless.<br>  <br>  Testosterone converts into a related chemical called dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is responsible for body hair.  As with testosterone, men have more DHT than women (females: 4-22 ng/dL DHT; males: 25-80 ng/dL DHT).|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	harmones|`|4MtR8MLpaa	The real question is why are women not harry.

BLD9EEWNaa	You may have torn your stomache lining- many bulimics do, because of the acid they produce in self induced vomiting.  Basically, a hole is developing in your stomache, and if you don't go to a doctor immediately, you could get very sick and possibly die.  Basically, the choice is between going to the doctor now, and going to the hospital later.|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Get medical help now. Could be a bleeding ulcer. This is serious, goget medical help asap.|`|jBZ6N82vaa	SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION NOW YOU COULD HAVE INTERNAL BLEEDING IN YOUR STOMACH FROM THE VOMITING|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	You better seek attention ASAP
MtDEf9zxaa	I am like that somewhat.  I tend to remember very vivid details (like what someone wore, said, ordered, etc.) more than others.  However, these vivid memories are often linked to another memory that means more to me (don't know if that makes sense).  For example, I might remember what someone said but what I was really paying attention to was what they were wearing or how they said it or what was going on behind them or something like that.  So that girl could have remembered you because she remembered something else about that day.  Maybe when she went to the back to put in your order, something else happened that became an important memory to her.  Then the memory of you and your order become attatched to her memory of whatever happened in the back.  I hope that makes sense.  I don't know if everyone else is like me, but when I remember details that seem unimportant they are usually linked to an important memory.
BtDGWKSNaa	for the first one it could have been a panic attack, or you may have anxiety issues.<br>  <br>  secondly, i think you have depression.<br>  <br>  and no, your therapist will not be mad.  he/she's there to help you.  he/she'll be glad you're opening up to her.|`|HF1TfsnTaa	Anxiety panic disorder. Ther are several medications for this. See your primary doctor and good luck too you.|`|prWgKpmYaa	believe me your therapist won't get mad anyway if you got stress or any questoins  ask me ok don't waste your money on therapist >.<|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Its hereditary and its called depression|`|6UkP1jNnaa	The fast heart rate, shortness of breath etc definitely sound like a panic attack, I agree. But i do believe that depression can be caused by experiences and is not just hereditary..<br>  <br>  I think that if you feel your therapist may be mad at you for revealing your true feelings/actions, she may not be the correct therapist for you. I have had 3 since i moved to this area 4 yrs ago, and only recently found one that I really feel comfortable with. Hes the first therapist I've ever told about my cutting. Its not something to be ashamed of (not something to be proud of either) its just a way to release some of that pent up anger and anxiety you are feeling. <br>  ..Its really important (i think, plz remember i am NOT a professional) that you understand where these feelings are coming from. and remember you are not the only one who is feeling them! If it is hereditary, you might consider antidepressants, which are life changing and amazing as long as you are on the correct one. I regret to advise against something thats illegal, but marijuana is a great anti depressant for some people as well.<br>  <br>  I hope i kind of helped you out, and I hope you can find your way out of what you are dealing with.|`|t2x7Cr6Gaa	What you are experiencing is anxiety attacks and panic attacks. That's why you heart  is beating so fast and also why you feel the way you do. If you are self harming , and you feel that you can tell her , then do it. She will be so proud of you, not because of what you are doing but because you have told her.<br>  I think even now talking on here and telling us on here is a step in the right direction. so good for you. I hope you get well soon. What you have i curable, and i wish you luck and hope you do tell your therapist.

WJjr2E0haa	Did you pay with your credit card? If you paid seperately for your lenses then if you don't get this straightened out with the doctor then dispute it on your card. Make sure you keep track of all conversations, etc with the doctors office. Document well. This will help you out. Also, if they are a member of the BBB then you can put a complaint in there. Next time you are in the office, look around (without drawing attention) for a number or something on the wall that says "if you have any concerns or problems then contact....."<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|K4rP4A0naa	It sounds like what a lot of optometrists do which is get you to buy glasses or lenses through them because they can mark them up a lot because most people trust them and think they should do what they say. <br>  <br>  The fact that your eye exam took only 5 minutes and they seem to be avoiding letting you change your mind is suspicious, but it should take a while to have them made up so maybe you can still cancel it.
tVF9O1Olaa	I have applied for part time jobs before and they have never asked why i was applying for part time. They have advertised part time so they know you want it and will not ask questions. If you had an interview for full time and you said in your interview that part time would be better then they may question you but not if the job you have applied for is already part time.<br>  <br>  There are many reason why you could have applied for part time, ie you already have a part time job, you have a family, you are studying or you have lost your last job and you would take anything right now!! <br>  <br>  Good luck in the job|`|VcykWwCYaa	I think the most important issue for the employer will be whether you will be able to do the work expected of you 100%.<br>  <br>  It shouldn't matter if you feel you can only work part-time or full-time. If you feel that you can offer them the quality of work then there is no reason to tell them that you have any issues.<br>  <br>  If they are looking for a full-time employee then that is a different issue altogether.<br>  <br>  Usually there is a 3 month cooling off period for new employees so if you are not working as required and they are not happy, they will ask you to leave but at least you have given it a chance.|`|QjP2qtSnaa	Just make up something that sounds good, but believable.  I like your idea of other commitments.  Maybe you just need a part time job to supplement other income.  School is a common excuse.

m2Z4wnE5aa	Pharmacist will talk to you over the phone and answer your health-care questions.<br>  Keep in mind if you are on prescription medications and have questions concerning any type of interactions, whether it is from other prescriptions, vitamins/ minerals, over the counter products, natural products, or even food interactions, it is best to call the pharmacy where you fill your prescription drugs.  The reason is that the pharmacist will be able to see exactly what his/her pharmacy chain has filled for you.  If you call a pharmacy you have never filled at they will not have any info on the medications your on.|`|AA10723498	Of course they will.  That's their job and People will do it all the time.

They have a website that should explain all your issues and concerns about growing lavender plants in northern climates.<br>  <br>  Several key items <br>  - Plants must be put in sandy soil.  Lavender plants do not like their feet to be wet (so heavy loam soil will rot the roots).<br>  - Plants need protection from the cold - either straw or snow cover<br>  - Lavender plants need extra water during the first two to three years, then they should be good even in overly dries summers.  <br>  - Plants that are cared for should last 10 to 15 years, however, some can go well beyond that.

BgVWSApdaa	I've been there twice and I promise you that what you are going through is a phase even though it feels like it will last forever.  Remember that you now are doing the most important job in the world - shaping the life of another human being, and a precious child of your own at that!  Your body will come around with a little work  but the change is worth it for the treasure you now have.  And your hair will grow back.  One thing that will help is to try to do one nice or fun thing for yourself every day.  Treat yourself well.  I know that's hard with a little one but you need to carve out a few minutes for you.  Maybe its just lighting a candle while you take care of the baby or putting on your favorite music and dancing with the baby.  Maybe its a nap or a bubble bath while the baby is napping.  It also helps to get out of the house fairly regularly.  Go out for a walk or to the mall while the baby is small, and then out for coffee, etc as your child gets older.

You have to see your doctor immediately or call him for an emergency appointment. Some antidepressants will work for some but not for others. So it is a matter of trying another. If that one doesn't cause a change in 3 to 4 weeks try another one. There is help for you please you have to be persistent in the process of getting well. This won't get better it will get worse if you don't make a change. Unfortunately all women who have given birth go home and find that their clothes don't fit. This can last for a while but your perception of the problem isn't right because of your depression. You will with the proper diet lose the weight. You can't see or understand this now in the state you are in. Right now everything seems hopeless and impossible and there is help to get out of this state of mind. For you beautiful baby please call your doctor. You are lucky that you have a husband who is so supportive but he can't help this and you can't without your doctor's help. There is something that I like to read when I get in a depressed state ALL Shall BE WELL, and ALL Shall BE WELL, ALL MANNER OF THINGS WILL BE WELL. I am so sorry for what you are going through but I can tell you from my own experience with Post Partum Depression that it does take courage and strength to get out of it and your doctor will help you. These feelings are temporary and soon you will wonder how on earth you could have felt the way you do now. Your mind is fooling you and what you are feeling is not reality. Please I wish you and your  new baby the best, your little bundle of joy deserves the best of you. You don't deserve these feelings. Please call your doctor.  Your hair will grow out quickly and for now you can have a stylist repair and give your hair a beautiful look until it does. Talk to friends and family it is so important to have support around you during this time. Don't keep your feelings to yourself.

ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	If she is not in the mood - ie not relaxed about it it will be uncomfortable for her.  She needs to be swept away with the moment.  Good luck.|`|cWuumdy7aa	First ofall are you both above 18 than only you should think of sex. if yes then please dont have sex before marriage.But if you want to have sex go for the fore play first Foreplay is the one thing women can't get enough of -- OK, there are a few other things as well, but foreplay is an important one. In general terms, women are emotional creatures, and that's why they like, enjoy and often need foreplay.<br>  <br>  Unlike their male counterparts, women aren't raring to get down to it. This is because their bodies need help conjuring the lust and lubrication required for intercourse and their emotions dictate that they feel a sense of closeness and mutual respect with their partner. All of this can be achieved through foreplay, which will also help your lady friend feel desired by you; if you simply want to jump her bones, she'll feel like a tool or a machine designed to get you off. Now, each woman is different, and some might like to bump uglies without any foreplay, but the odds are that your girl will need to grease the wheels first.<br>  <br>  That said, here are five foreplay tips that'll help you turn everyday frolicking into something that will have any woman you seduce begging for satisfaction]<br>  Strip shows aren't just for men anymore; women have gotten wise to the idea of having men perform a peel dance for them. While I don't suggest you dance for her as you take off your socks or install a pole in your bedroom, I do recommend that you remove your clothes slowly (especially if you're fit). Remove your socks before you do anything; they're awkward and nothing turns a woman off faster than seeing a naked man with his socks on. Now that you're set to go, start by removing your shirt (unbutton it slowly while maintaining eye contact), then your pants, and finally your underwear.<br>  <br>  At this point, undress her just as slowly. Sit her down and remove her clothing in the same order you removed yours.<br>  Once again, I have to say that every woman is different and, therefore, every woman likes to be touched differently. However, the same techniques that you hopefully used in high school are still effective in the majority of women. Bring your hand to her vaginal area and, with the tips of your fingers, rub her outer lips (labia majora) by spreading them apart and bringing them back together; that should start the lubrication process.<br>  <br>  When she spreads her legs a bit, that's a clear indication that she wants you to touch her a little deeper. At this point, you can start lightly rubbing her inner lips (labia minora), and then move up to her clitoris, which you should rub in a circular motion. Some women like their clitoris to be touched gently, while others prefer a more vigorous contact; read your girlfriend's body language for a sign of what you should do.<br>  <br>  After a few minutes, bring your mouth to the area and, while you continue to use your fingers to play around inside her, suckle her clitoris to give her some great <br>  Porn can be a great way to get you and your girl in the mood, provided that your girlfriend is the type who enjoys adult entertainment. Put on something that both of you can enjoy (preferably other couples having sex and something tailored to women), and lay naked with each other while you watch it. Remember that an "accidental" caress here and there is perfectly acceptable, even preferable.<br>  <br>  Every now and then, stop watching the movie and kiss her or play with her body. Make sure to pay more attention to her than you do to the movie. As well, if you see something kinky that you'd like to try, make a comment about it and gauge her response, which will give you an indication of whether or not she's game. The idea here is to get her imagination going.|`|ZllkWRIOaa	then don't?|`|g6pqGjrkaa	It is not ad viced and do not have the sex in this age even if your friend offer her to you.  that may be infatuation interest or thrill over sex to know what it is.

YAZnr518aa	They used to think I had OCD when I was young because I did have symptoms but I now realize that it was a side effect of to much sugar. I used to smoke pot and it caused panic attacks I thought something was wrong but in reality it was a side effect of the pot. Last night I was going off  2 hours of sleep and panic creep in as I drove home haven't had this in years tingling finger weird feelings of losing control I went home and slept now im fine. Just because your well informed doesn't make me a hypochondriac nor does it you. My point is there is always a cause and effect relationship for most mental and physical problems analyze any risk factors smoking tobacco caffeine sleep deprivation diet sun exposure or lack of and try to eliminate any risk factors related to aggravated OCD and anxiety.|`|P8eKPMVvaa	No, your not the only one. I was diagnose with Bipolar Level one (not the big bad one) with anxiety disorder. My mind use to race like that..sometimes I would get so caught up in those thoughts that I would physically have an emotional response..(like crying, feeling very sad, getting angry..etc) That is anxiety. Like I said before I do have Bipolar but my is like I great depressed (but not to the point that I can't function, I still work) that is hypo-mania and I feel awful during that time. Then there is hyper-mania I get obsessed with cleaning everything has to be in its place (kinda ocd in this mania) I don't sleep for days. All of this started or should I say surfaced right after my cousin who lived with me and my family for several years passed away from breast cancer then 2 months later I lost my dad to leukemia. After that things got really bad for me. I went to my doctor cause I literaly thought I was losig my mind. I was then diagnosed by my doctor with bpd with anixety and I just about fell out of my chair ( being a nurse and dealt with people who had bpd I was scared to death but that can from not knowing there was different levels to it) before I was placed on medicine I was asked to keep a journal for a month, luckly I have always keep one, brought it to him then got put on medicine and I don't have hypo or hyper-mania unless I become stubborn an just don't take it (nurse make the worse patients). I don't like my dignoses but I know I not alone. As being a hypochondria I have been told I was this ever since I was little..I just look over it. If I'm not running a fever or got n/v etc...then I just keep on going and those feeligs of being sick just go away after time. But I would suggest that you see your doctor and tell him/her  how you are feeling. It just not be as bad as you think it is. So again no, you are not only (just a lot of people want share their story but, I don't care to).

AA10723498	I can understand your concerns about antibiotics, but yeast infections only occur sometimes and it will happen to those who take them often.  You really should be on an antibiotic for a UTI because those bacteria can get really nasty and cause a great deal of pain.  You said you have 250 Mg.but of what kind of Penicillin.  There are so many types and you have to take the right one.  Some antibiotics just won't touch a UTI.  Usually a Dr. will give you a sulfur drug like Bactrim for a UTI depending on how bad it is.  I wouldn't take an old drug that you've had around for a while.  It may not be as potent as it originally was and like I said, it may be the wrong thing.  Why can't you just go to any ER in England to get it checked out.  I heard that in England, antibiotics can be bought over the counter.  Is that true?  seems weird if it is.  Let me know what kind of med you have.  Hope you feel better.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	You need to take the medication that your doctor prescribes, exactly as he or she tells you to.  Are your antibiotics left over from a previous infection?  You always need to take antibiotics exactly as prescribed, until they are all.  If you don't, leftover bacteria will multiply and cause more problems. <br>  <br>  You need to see a doctor to get appropriate treatment for your UTI.  There are no natural remedies.  Untreated UTI could lead to kidney damage.<br>  <br>  Yes, taking antibiotics can lead to yeast infections, but eating yogurt and taking probiotic supplements can be helpful.<br>  <br>  Believe me, not treating your UTI with antibiotics will cause many more problems for you than taking the antibiotics will cause.

6SIjchQUaa	Yes, once you heal from the surgery you will be able to resume your normal life.|`|EMNwWAuvaa	Here is my answer.  I am not in favor of you having a surgical intervention at your age unless there is loss of muscle function.  Statistically surgical interventions are only successful fifty percent of the time.  Long term studies have shown that at the end of twelve to eighteen months there is no difference between patients that underwent the procedure and those that did not.  At your age you want this to be over with as soon as possible to get on with your life.  Understandable but remember that once a track has been opened in that disc it is always going to be open and subject to stress that it normally wouldn't.  So lifting is going to have to be somewhat curtailed.  Have you been to physical therapy?  Going to work with a therapist that does backs could save you from going through with the procedure and the worst that could happen is that you are going to be stronger before having the procedure.  Remember that to have the disc worked on they must remove a piece of bone called a lamina to get at the disc.  That loss of bone makes the vertebrae above and below behave in an abnormal way creating stress that would not be there thus setting you up for early degenerative changes in the vertebrae.  Talk all of this over with your surgeon.  If you still decide to go forth with the procedure see a neurosurgeon about this.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	Please consider other options besides surgery. I always had back pain (worked outdoors and did weights in gym) and a chiropracter kept me out of surgery for decades, I did have two surgeries after age 45, neither of which I have fully recovered from, plus I have fairly intense pain every day now due to nerve scarring. Once you go under the knife too many things can go wrong. Don't chance it at your age. Do physical therapy, chiropractic adjustments, and protect your back by wearing braces, eating right and lifting properly.
dMqytjONaa	This is a good step in the right direction. losing weight has more to do with knowing your calorie intake requirements and then creating a deficit. Excess calories eating is stored in your body as fat, so if you create a deficit then the body, doesn't crash and burn, instead it will use what it stored, in this case it's fat reserves.<br>  <br>  So if you can create a daily calorie deficit through diet and exercise then yes you will loose weight.

Do not drink out of a straw, the sucking power can cause dry socket. As far as infection anti biotic  are the only thing I know of you can take.|`|AA10723498	Did the Dr. prescribe one for you and you just don't want to take it?  If he did, you should consider it.  Taking antibiotics once in a while won't hurt you.  Many Dr. are shying away from giving out antibiotics for every little thing, but having a huge open tooth socket without antibiotics can be a little touchy.  If he/she gave them to you, my advice is to get them.  Otherwise, get a lot of Vit, C.  Vit C is considered the "Healing vitamin"  rinse your mouth our many times a day with warm water and salt.  Especially after you eat.  You don't want food particles to get there and stay there.  Salt is very good at healing, as far as preventing infections, no. You will have to keep that area very clean while healing.  Hope you feel better soon.  If I come across something else that may help, I'll let you know.  Good luck|`|c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	Drink plenty of water and follow the instructions the doctor gave you. You don't really need to take antibiotics if there is no infection.

The only thing they gave me was painkillers and an irrigation syringe. Just make sure you rinse all food out of the holes, and don't smoke or suck out of a straw because you will get dry socket. I got this, and I went back in and they stuck packed cloves in the holes, and it hurt more, not to mention that my mouth constantely tasted like cloves. NASTy.

278113a07b7b6648ec6e32639de20bf9aa	Seeker of Knowledge has the best answer for you so far.  It is true - if you "starve" your body of essential nutrients (and fat is one of them), it will store fat.  Here's the deal - your body doesn't know the difference between a "famine" (lack of food available) and self starvation (not eating the necessary foods to sustain oneself).  Therefore, in order to survive the perceived "famine," your body will store fat so that you can "survive" the ordeal.  <br>  <br>  This is what happens, on a smaller scale, to people who skip meals, particularly breakfast.  Many people who are overweight either start skipping breakfast in order to "lose weight," or they GOT overweight by skipping breakfast over a period of years (due to laziness or whatever).  It is a known fact that breakfast jump starts your metabolism for the day.  I am a trim lady, always have been, and have ALWAYS eaten breakfast.  We eat eggs 4-5 times a week for breakfast, with whole grain toast (Ezekiel Bread), turkey sausage, and fresh raw fruit (grapefruit, blueberries, bananas, etc.).<br>  <br>  Read a book called, "The Schwarzbein Principle" and you will see what I am talking about.  Your breakfast really doesn't have any good sources of protein.  A bowl of cereal w/ milk is not a good source - unless you're getting a high-quality "real" Museli, or a homemade granola that includes nuts and shredded coconut.  It appears you've skipped lunch - not a good idea.  I did this "to be healthy" in college -so basically for 4 years, and it cost me yet another 5 years of my life - WASTED - trying to repair the damage I did to my body all that time.  I had fertility issues, anxiety, panic attacks, blood sugar issues, insomnia, and much more.  ALL of these symptoms where remedied after eating appropriately (enough calories, fat, etc.) for a few years.  For about 2 months I literally thought I was going to die.  All because I had starved myself for 4 years (and I am small, too, usually 100 pounds pre-pregnancy).  <br>  <br>  Your dinner was the only decent meal of the day.|`|dbdKFCELaa	yea it does! <br>  you have fruit, vegatables, protein and carbohydrates! :D|`|810KsQ7vaa	Depnds on the type of cereal protein.

They went away and I have no side effects anymore. But if you have been taking them for more than one or two weeks then definitely go see a Dr or call the pharmacy as mentioned above.|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	I have taken both drugs for legitimate reasons, and have never experienced, or even heard of, that side-effect.  It could be serious.  My advice:  find the nearest 24-hour Walgreens, call them, ask to speak to a pharmacist, and ask him what you need to ask him.  Once you hit business hours (I don't know what time zone you're in, but it's early here) call your doctor with the same question.  Do NOT put this off.  The danger could be quite serious.

I was in an intense workout program running two miles a day, each in under 8 minutes. After almost a month of this program, I realized that I was gaining a lot of weight and didn't understand why. I started to panic, and stopped eating for weeks at a time, and during these weeks, my weight kind of stabilized, but when I stopped fasting, the weight would continue to increase. After about 3 months, I had a bit of a belly, but I didn't really look more than tubby.    <br>  <br>  Then, whether you believe this is true or not, and believe me, there is an entire ER staff in Valencia that couldn't believe it right in front of them. I was on vacation in california and went to the hospital with horrible pains, and found out I was in labor. I couldn't believe this! I had no clue that I was pregnant because I have always had an untimely period and experienced spotting during the pregnancy, and because I didn't even look pregnant. <br>  <br>  After the baby was born, I started a pretty intense yoga workout program and the weight all came off.

Anywhere there are live healthy cells to attack, cancer can be there.  I really don't think your friend has a tumor, because it moves so freely, but it should be looked at.  There are also things called fatty tumors which are harmless as well and can grow anywhere.  As it's name indicates, it's just a fat deposit.  The thing with cysts is they can grow and hurt, but are usually never cancer.  Tell your friend not to take any chances and get it looked at.

yPLS0FeWaa	That depends on each individual. It's a spectrum disorder so each person with autism is different and has to be handled on an individual basis no matter how alike they may seem. Many like set routines, many have sensory issues, many can have other conditions that co-exist with the autism, many are visual learners, they interpret language very literally, many need speech and occupational therapy. One of key things is they lack social interaction and communication skills. Always be patient with them and usually any form of behavior is some form of communication, they just do't know how to communicate as we do so many times it comes out in behavior. To better understand autism from their perspective I would read this excert form Ellen Notbohm's book titled Ten Things Every Child With Autism Wishes You Knew (<a href="http://graphicpieces.com/autism10thingschild.html" rel="nofollow">http://graphicpieces.com/autism10thingsc...</a> ), if you are looking for resources/activities for those on the spectrum, this link has some great stuff ( <a href="http://graphicpieces.com/autresrce.html" rel="nofollow">http://graphicpieces.com/autresrce.html</a> ). If you could be more detailed about who you are inquiring about we might be able to give a more specific answer to your question.|`|Y6YrRo7Uaa	My brother is 6 and has autism. He pretty much just does everything repetitively. They like things to be the same pretty much all the time. They only eat certain foods, watch certain shows, and play certain games. Pretty much they can be treated like all other children, but don't try to mix things up too much, or they can get very anxious.|`|a98MpjZ9aa	All autistic children suffered from some sort of trauma at birth or shortly thereafter.  You will find there is a statistical correlation between autism and at least one of the following:  premature birth, caesarean birth, precociousness at birth (as with geniuses, born with open eyes so as to experience the shock of birth), surgery, severe illness, asthma, being born a twin,  allergic to mother's milk, etc.) <br>  <br>  The big problem is that babies traumatized at birth blame their mothers.  Therefore, they fear and dislike their mothers.  The best way for an autistic child to get better is to have someone else raise the child.  His lack of love is totally irrational and prevents him from growing emotionally, but when he snaps out of it, he will learn to love his mother for real,

ozWi3TJlaa	Yes.  My husband is seeing an orthopedic specialist for arthritis in both knees, and the specialist is also sending him to a physical therapist twice a week to strengthen the muscles around the arthritis as well as improve the flexibility.  That's certainly complementary medicine.|`|AA11173395	Yes, because it is an evidenced based practice, rather than something verified in an operating room or a laboratory.|`|5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	Begrudingly, there are forms of physical therapy that I would consider "complementary" because they are based on loose theoretical models of "rhythms" and "enegy fields" as opposed to evidence and are usually used in conjunction with traditional physical therapy.  When used in isloation, I would consider them "alternative" therapies.  <br>  <br>  Complimentary and alternative treatments used in PT include myofascial release, trigger point release, cranio-sacral therapy, etc.  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, these types of treatments cloud the integrity of physical therapy which is being emphasized to be an evidence based practice.  The evidence for exercise and manual therapies far outweighs the treatments listed above.  <br>  <br>  For those who are interested in "alternative" and "complimentary" medicines as their field of study, I think they would be largely disappointed because the education focuses on evidence based practice.|`|lOZF75iWaa	Most therapies are "complementary". It means they work with each other, ie they complement each other; so if someone has energy work, physical manipulation and dietary advice, they are all complementary because they work together to achieve the client's goal of health and wellness.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the labels.

For running, I run at a speed of 5.5-6 mph on an incline of 0-1, with 1 minute of warm-up before I run at 3.5 mph and for at least 5-10 minutes to cool down afterward. I stretch as well for approximately 5 minutes. I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal.

I was 180 in March of this year and now I am 140 lean and solid at 5'1"(do not look it though). Still losing fat and gaining muscle.

You should be extremely proud of yourself for being able to overcome that.  I know how hard it is to push those voices out of your head.  But sizes mean nothing... your self-worth is not measured by the size you wear or by the number on the scale.  I know it sounds cheesy, but beauty comes from inside.  I am sure you look much much better now than you did before.  Size 7 is still slim.  You've got nothing to worry about.  Keep up the great work!|`|A4G03Bzbaa	absolutely not.  That is on the skinny side.  Perfectly healthy.|`|8ec3c0b2a9a7fea3610c3a2b56080d4eaa	I've been there before. I used to be a size 3 and now I'm closer to a 7/9. There is nothing to be ashamed of. 7 is still on the slender side. And the best thing to do with that little voice is to ignore it. If you are happy and feel good, 7 is a great place for you to be. Best of luck!|`|HPFe7Jlpaa	NO! i ignore those voices and screw them. If you feel good you also look good. Don't feel bad. im proud of you (: ... im a size 1 to a 3 ... still recovering

Ow6lKFXiaa	(Note: I answered this in the other catagory where you put this by accident.  I'm copying my answer in the hopes that it helps you in some way.)<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  <br>  Just about anyplace you'd go but, of course, geared to that person's mental age.  If their mental age is on a child's level, I suggest a children's museum...they can touch all the exhibits.  A petting zoo or a farm that's open to the public. A local animal shelter (call to arrange a special visit).<br>  <br>  This is not an easy one...there are so many places where the senses can be fulfilled but, unfortunately, are not very welcoming to those with special needs.<br>  <br>  Is this one person or several with varying abilities?<br>  <br>  Anyplace that encourages touch, smell, taste.  <br>  <br>  A park to smell, see, hear, feel nature.<br>  An ice cream shop, sample different flavors.<br>  A store that sells musical instruments: ask if they will allow your friend(s) to touch the instruments...the deaf will feel the vibrations and can enjoy along with those who hear.<br>  A candle store...the aromas and the waxy feel and different candle shapes.<br>  A fabric and craft store...fabric & plastic flowers, candle perfumes, fake stones of varying smoothness, rubber stamps, wood shapes, etc.<br>  <br>  Check with the manager of the stores so they know that you will be handling the items and to avoid trouble.  Many are very receptive and will even direct you to items that involve the senses. <br>  <br>  The local mall...it has many stores to explore: costume jewelry, stuffed animals, music, wind chimes, etc.<br>  <br>  I hope these ideas help.  Thank you for going out of your way to enrich the lives of those who are different.|`|Z66iGfccaa	anywhere!  didn't you hear about the blind guy that reached the everest summit?<br>  <br>  I'm not sure where you mean specifically, but there aren't very many limitations these days, people are learning more and more to live with their disabilities and do lots of things despite them.
eLxD5HbBaa	Plan B is essentially just a stronger version of the pill so if you are already on the pill its not really going to do much, i would still suggest you pop into the doctor asap and ask you might find it embarrassing to ask these questions but its better that your embarrassed now then pregnant later!

zhk8o514aa	Bad news for you.  How do you know they will be using a urine test?  More and more companies now days are using hair samples.  Which is far more reliable.|`|V20PTwMmaa	HAHAH your SCREWEDDDDD dude|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	Probably not. The reason being that pot is so harmless to your body that your body doesn't try very hard to get rid of it. It can take over a month to remove most of it from your body, and even longer sometimes. You did probably lower the amount of THC in your body quite drastically.|`|f1f7IQIKaa	Bro your good alright. How dank was this sh!t? anyways,I had the same problem. I was smoking some Stank Dro. Anyways little did I know they drug tested before I could volenteer at this Anna Maria place. I drank so much water, (The test was 3 weeks ahead of when I realised it)  and took my friends dads body flush pills. It was great. Not the pills because I nearly **** my pants.  But I passed,easy. so,drink alott,piss allot,and you will be good.|`|VHybyedbaa	down as much beetroot juice as you can.|`|KO5extXiaa	use water pills a week before your test. <br>  <br>  :)|`|P8eKPMVvaa	I not going to judge. But, I will tell you that if they do a hair sample it will tell everything that you have done for 6 months. That is what they told me when I had one for my new job. (and if you shave you head bald then they will get the hair for somewheres else on you body..friend had that done to him) But, a friend of my use to go to the store and get sure-gel. It is used for canning. She would put it in water and drink it about 3-4 times a day for least 2 days. She never had any problems with passing a drug test and she did stuff like that a lot. If you are really worried go the a pharmacy and get a home drug test kit(urine) and take it.|`|5DP859Gxaa	Damn pot heads.<br>  opption one is to not do it at all<br>   I suggest drinking alot of water the day before and the day of. But also drink kool-aid and juice. (so ur urine aint to clear) Lay around and do nothing that way you dont burn any fat or white cells that hold the THC.<br>   Its worked for my hubby and friends!!!
S5FZy9Ppaa	I do not see why not? ok cupcake?|`|23xC6I2Gaa	If you are dealing the marijuanna... Its up in the air. It depends on how much you consumed in one sitting the last time you did drugs. If someone just breathes in second-hand smoke, it can still be in their system for a week or so... So actually doing the drug yourself, you can be looking at a month or so.<br>  <br>  And 90% of the time, the "detox" methods that people talk about, don't actually work. So I wouldn't count on that.<br>  <br>  And you're right, they probably won't do a hair test... it's too expensive.<br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|opFgD3NRaa	if its just a physical they dont usually test for pot haha other then that theres really no way of telling if youll pass or not. supposedly pot stays in ur system for 3 months in which case ur screwed. but i know plenty of people who smoked the day before their test and still passed. But those may have been hair tests im not sure. anyhoo your pretty much gonna have to wait and see or skip the appointment and rescheule for a few weeks down the road. good luck!

hE4CXKX2aa	With what you said, you are about 37 lbs underweight for a tone atlethic body.  And what these guys don't know is musle weighs more than fat.  What you should do is get with a physican and get expert advice.  I would even tell you to eat energy bars and such.  Also when you do eat, it can be actually a little of both of the good and bad foods.  But do more of the good foods.  And I mean good as in proper calorie.  Not this super low calorie food with low carbs.   Come on, your body needs energy and it ain't going to get squat from stupid foods as such.|`|NGHdmQwoaa	well maybe that is a bit under Weight but don't sweat it the height doesn't matter it sounds ok but the weight sounds a little bit under the best thing to do would be 2 see your doc<br>  hope this helps :)|`|pW9KhTFvaa	probably nothing wrong.  just make sure your diet is right.  Cut out any added sugar and any processed white flour foods.  Eating meat, vegetables, fruit, and nuts is definately the way to go.|`|N2VuU805aa	if you want to gain weight, simply EAT MORE. not bad stuff, more good stuff, you're obviously burning a lot of calories by all the activities you do so you just have to consume more than you burn off.  you should probably try to gain some weight though, also maybe try to build some muscle mass to gain some weight : )|`|rLSd9Z1Faa	You have lots of muscle and a fast metabolism, both are making you not able to gain a lot of weight.

6UBSUzUIaa	Are you sure it's your lungs? If it's around your chest/rib cage area it could be gas pains, which at times can be unbearable. Also, it could be "referred pain" meaning that you pain is being deferred from another area to your lungs. Also, do you smoke? I would also look into acid reflux and other gastrointestinal problems. Try writing a diary of what you eat and see if certain foods bring on these spasms. I had the same problem and it was severe acid reflux. Just a suggestion ;)<br>  Let me know how everything works out for you!|`|PYK3FzbHaa	u might have lung problems
EMNwWAuvaa	Bill, first off you are doing the correct approach to see a doctor about this.  If it had remained only in the lower back it would be one thing but with the advent of pain radiating down the leg it potentially could be something else.  Try these three movements to see if they don't help you.  Sit in a straight chair and turn your head to the left as far as you can and then to the right.  One side will turn further than the other.  Start with the side that turns the most.  Turn in that direction as far and hard as you can for fifteen seconds and then relax for thirty seconds.  Repeat this same cycle twice more on that side and then do it on the other.  Remember to do it a total of three times on the other side and do it as hard and far as you can.  Now get up and move around there should be less pain and restriction in the back.  Sit in the chair again and raise the left arm up as high as it will go and then do the right arm.  One arm is going to move further than the other.  Start with that arm.  Raise it up as hard and far as you can for fifteen seconds and then rest for thirty seconds.  Do that twice more and then switch to the other side and do three sets on that side.  Upon completion stand up and walk around.  There should be less pain and more movement in the lower back.  Finally sit again and turn the body to the left as far as you can and then to the right.  Keep the thighs together and don't let them move from the starting position.  Start with the side that turns the most.  Turn in that direction as hard and far as you can for fifteen seconds and then rest for thirty seconds.  Repeat that cycle twice more and then go to the other side.  Do the three repetitions of that cycle and get up and walk around.  The pain should be down and more movement present.  Do these movements at least twice a day until there is no more pain or restriction.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	Generally a shooting pain like you describe is nerve pain. Possibly the sciatic nerve, as it is going down the leg. Does it feel like someone kicked you in the buttcheek? That's nerve. Pulling a muscle usually you hear or feel a pop, but the pain sets in hours later. Sore, achy deep throbbing pain. Shooting piercing pain is probably a pressed nerve from the spine.|`|3YJe5Z4Faa	Typically doctors are advised not to make the diagnosis of pinched nerve unless the pain is shooting below the level of the knee.  The reason is that pulled/sprained back muscles can cause pain that radiates to the buttocks/thigh.<br>  <br>  Some doctors believe that a course of steroids could help speed resolution of a pinched nerve; others say no.  Up to you whether or not you want to bring it up.  No role for steroids in the initial treatment of a pulled muscle, however.
39KUKALFaa	The trouble is that there are great cheap ways to do it available in Asia but the FDA will not certify the prosthetic devices.<br>  <br>  In Laos, I have seen Japanese made 100V single phase coils that are wrapped around the shaft of the penis and are then lubricated with Panda dung and ground rhinoceros horn. The coil creates a magnetic field facilitating the absorption of the Panda dung and ground rhinoceros horn into the tissues of the penis.<br>  <br>  While the smell is bad for some time, the penis grows and stays grown with monthly applications up to twice its erect length and up to 3 times its girth. This technology was developed from the discovery of the effects of natural ferro magnetic fields in iron ore deposits struck by lightning on Panda penis size by a royal Prince in what is now Vientiane in the 16th Century. The rhinoceros horn is a concession to Chinese natural and herbal medicine.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you can get tattoos and piercings that make it look bigger.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	at your age you would not have access to get a professional grade penis pump (unless an adult gets it for you), so Jelqing (online instructions on the web).<br>  <br>  /Jerome|`|Eku8XD2Gaa	at 14 u hav ample time to grow and dont be embarrased of any thing<br>  <br>  jus read on the following links they will unfold all ur answers<br>  <a href="http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/25-Myths-and-Facts-About-Sex.477823" rel="nofollow">http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/25-My...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.healthmad.com/Men's-Health/Common-Sex-Queries.510033" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthmad.com/Men's-Health/Co...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/Adult-Games-Foreplay.538737" rel="nofollow">http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/Adult...</a>|`|RIbjSybYaa	this will sound weird but if you masturbate with baking soda or powder in your hands over time it will actually lengthen. the enzymes in the powder cause a larger rush of blood than usual to run to the penis when it is erect, thus over time, it will make it larger. hope that helps!|`|scX6smKVaa	blimey you are only 14 so would have only started to grow!! wait untill you ar eat least 21 before you start worrying!! everyone grows at different rates!|`|rQVA71Vkaa	by me riding it|`|WrfCAhVRaa	hi there...<br>  if you want to make your dick bigger, try some product, for example  JesExtender (The Clinically Proven Penis Enlarger, Penis enlargement devices are quickly becoming the first choice for any man wanting to enlarge his penis), PenisHealth (Natural Penis Enlargement Program, With so few quality penis enlargement exercise programs around PenisHealth is certain to convert like crazy for you, With 300+ videos and photos, 35 unique exercises, 24 hour support, and a 6 month guarantee), SizeGenetics (Clinically Proven Male Enhancement), Ultimate Stretcher (Male Enhancement Has Never Been So Simple),|`|8rX2fSB5aa	Other than drastic surgery, there is no proven way to make your penis bigger.

Your body's telling you not to drink alcoholic beverages.
iK3YYRaTaa	You are doing the right thing. But doctors can test for the first time even if you eat. Its called a random test.<br>  <br>  What Are Normal Blood Glucose And Blood Sugar Levels<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There are various methods to determine blood glucose level. Some tests give you accurate diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes, while others will tell you how well you are managing your diabetes. <br>  <br>  Fasting Blood Sugar Test:<br>  Measures the blood sugar level after 8 hours fast or overnight. Normal fasting blood glucose level is less than 100mg/dl. If your fasting blood glucose level is from 100mg/dl to 125mg/dl then you will have impaired blood glucose level also known as Pre-Diabetes. If your blood glucose level is above 125mg/dl then your doctor will diagnose as a patient of diabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood glucose test on any other day. If you have blood glucose level of 126mg/dl or higher in two consecutive tests, then you may have diabetes. If you have blood glucose level greater than 200mg/dl and you have symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision etc, then you may be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus without confirming it with second test. <br>  <br>  Random Blood Glucose Test:<br>  Random blood Glucose test gives your blood sugar at any time in a day. Normal random blood sugar level should be less than 200mg/dl. If your random blood glucose level is between 140mg/dl to 200mg/dl then you will have pre-diabetes. <br>  <br>  Oral glucose tolerance test<br>  This test measures your response to sugar. First we measure fasting blood glucose level, and then glucose solution is given, after that we measure blood glucose after 1 hour and 2hours. A normal blood glucose level after an oral glucose tolerance test is less than 140 mg/dL. Level between 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL suggests pre-diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher two hours after you drink the glucose solution may suggest that you have diabetes mellitus. <br>  <br>  Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test<br>  This test is not for diagnosing diabetes, but it shows you how well you have controlled your sugar in last 2 or 3 months. Normal value is less than 7%, however if it is more than 7 then you and your doctor should think of changing your treatment of diabetes. <br>  <br>  Always Remember, your blood glucose measurement alone is not enough to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may do some other tests to find out which type of diabetes you have. <br>  Take care and good luck . Diabetes is a terrible disease.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Yes it matters. If you have it done earlier it will be higher, if you had not completed the 12 hour fast.|`|pRF5LLloaa	It DOES matter!<br>  <br>  your blood sugar varies, minute by minute, based on when, what, and how much you've eaten.<br>  <br>  When not eating for 8-10 hours, this is called a FASTING BLOOD SUGAR.  This value show how low you blood sugar goes when you are about "out of fuel".  If this reading shows high blood sugar , there is a good possibility that you are diabetic.<br>  <br>  The diabetic patient needs to check their own blood sugars 3-4 times a day.  Most doctor recommend doing this just before meals -- like 5-10 minutes before.  In this case, you usually have not eaten for 3-4 hours, and your blood sugar would be NORMAL (80-120) at these times.<br>  <br>  of course, the first reading of the day, just before breakfast, when you haven't eaten for 8-10 hours (overnight) will also be a Fasting Blood Sugar reading.<br>  <br>  Some doctors also recommend taking blood sugar readings two hours after eating.  In this case the readings will be a little high, like 100-130.<br>  <br>  But NEVER take a reading ANY SOONER than two hours after eating!  At this time your digestion is still working, and you blood sugar readings WILL be high.  Readings taken sooner that two hours after eating are useless.<br>  <br>  You need to ASK your doctor to do a test called A1C.  this is a MUCH more accurate test than the simple "finger stick" fasting test.  AND -- you do not have to fast before taking the A1C test.<br>  <br>  The A1C test takes an average of your blood sugar readings over the last 90 days.  Becasue it is an average, you cannot "cheat" the test by eating properly for 2-3 days before taking the test, and the test is not effected by fasting or eating before the test.<br>  <br>  The A1C test is extremely important.  The American Diabetes Association recommends that EVERY normally healthy person have the A1C test done once a year.  This will help spot diabetes BEFORE it does any damagee to your internal organs, and well before it gets painful enough to visit the doctor.<br>  <br>  A diabetic patient needs to have the A1C test done once every three months, to help them see how well their treatment is working.|`|EeTs9DqUaa	It is better to have it checked in the morning, as close to the time you wake up.  If you go all day with out eating is not a good idea if you do have diabetes.|`|DIihJrUiaa	I think the most important thing is that the test is done at roughly the same time of day each time.|`|9e446fd9db4d9ad99d9a59fab5cbb25aaa	The time can effect your testing due to what you are eating during the day and what your body goes through. you also MUST fast for the 12 hours before or else your results will not be correct|`|waBq57jcaa	I remember my doctor telling me that as soon as i wake up in the mourning i could test it cause your fasting when you sleep anyways and then 2 hours after i eat my breakfast to see if its consistent readings.

Talk to your doctor.|`|AA10921760	It is the 12 hour fast that is important, not the exact time of the test.

Sumtimes i cross my legs and bounce my foot and count. Over and over. Either 5 or 9. Now I'm wondering if I should be concerned!  LOL.   Sorry I don't have an answer or opinion. Just wanted to comment.  Good luck!|`|sgPG1CL0aa	you have a case of OCD and would be very advantageous if you spoke to your Dr. to help you try and stop your obsessive counting.<br>  It can be helped and there is a way out.|`|VNVkCuI2aa	You have obsessive compulsive disorder.|`|YG8J5xA5aa	I had sort of the same thing ages ago where whenever i looked at a word or saw words on the tv or anyhting i would have to group the letters together in even groups. It annoyed me too but i just tried to stop myself and eventually it went away.<br>  Your problem sounds worse though, i think you should go to a doctor or psychiatrist because it sounds like a symptom of a type of schizophrenia.<br>  Don't be worried there are many types and some are not a problem to live with at all.
44b90c053b01c2794d2454eb16fcbea1aa	I would start by keeping a food journal. Write down everything you eat, and drink, so you can see where your calories are coming from.<br>  <br>  A woman of your height, weight and age has a BMR of 2500 caloories a day. That means your body needs 2500 calories a day to maintain your weight. If you cut back to a diet of 1500 calories, you would lose 2 pounds per week without having to exercise. I think that would be ideal for you since you're on your feet all day...how could you think about working out after that? <br>  <br>  Try a diet high in lean protein, plenty of vegetables and fresh fruit, and stick to only whole grains. I think you could lose alot of weight that way. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Saw your edit...if you did some powerwalking, cycling, or weight training, you would lose weight faster. As for the acai berry....the common blueberry has twice the antioxidants. Save your money.|`|AA10700407	you might have hit a plateau.  those are frustrating.  you might need to change your diet more.  you're certainly getting enough exercise at work.  give your body time to adjust and hopefully, you'll start to lose again.  congratulations on what you've already lost!|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	First off DO NOT buy any of the crap these people are pushing like acia berry and weight loss teas et al.  It's all just a scam to steal your money.  What you need to do is start to add some sort of resistance training to your regimen.  If you google "resistance training" you can find lots of free stuff out there.  All you really need is a few dumbbells and a cheap bench (optional) to get a really good fat burning workout at home. And, all you need to do is workout 30 minutes a day 3x's a week.  Remember to keep up a good diet and stay motivated. You've already lost 30 pounds.  That's awesome. great Job. Good Luck, you can do this.|`|FKwt8JM4aa	Here's your "non-scam" answer... Weight Watchers. It works.
AA10469101	Most important, is to remember that high reps and constant activity are better for toning and weight loss.  Low reps with more resistance are for building.  If you don't want to spend money, Push ups and dips are great for chest and triceps.  All you need is a couple of chairs and the floor.<br>  If you are too heavy, they may be too much to start with.  Biceps and back are tougher.  A pull up bar is probably all you would really need to start with though.  If you have access to a gym, or better equipment, a circuit routine of all the major body parts would be great.  Emphasis on machine flys and presses for chest and triceps, pull down exercises for back and curls for biceps.  Keep it simple.  Fancy routines are for when you get bored with the basics.  <br>  Machines are better for beginners because they force better control and are harder to hurt yourself on. <br>  Anything cardiovascular is going to help more with the weight though.|`|oBDkKdA4aa	i found this <a href="http://danistac.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-to-get-your-arms-toned.html" rel="nofollow">http://danistac.blogspot.com/2009/02/how...</a> and actually got some of the recommended dvds and i can already see results!! hope I helped;-)

ZDC81VjZaa	Sinus problems are a real bummer.  Have you been to see an allergist who might be able to recommend a histamine of some sort to shorten the duration of your agony?  I would start there... especially if this has been an ongoing problem for you.<br>  <br>    You may also want to inspect your home to see what might be causing your sinus problems such as:<br>  <br>  *  Is there mold growing anywhere in the house... damp places like under sinks, in tubs and showers, in the cellar or basement?  That needs to be taken care of.  It can be extremely hazardous to your health.<br>  <br>  *  When is the last time you changed your sheets or exchanged your pillows?<br>  <br>  *  How old is the mattress that you sleep on?  Is it time to replace it?<br>  <br>  *  When was the last time you vacuumed your bed or other furniture like the sofas and chairs and such?<br>  <br>  *  Do you have air ducts?  When were they last cleaned thorough?<br>  <br>  *  Do you have carpet?  Perhaps it's time to get it steamed... NOT shampooed but STEAMED.  Shampoo never rinses completely and is a huge dirt magnet as it leaves a residue.  Steam removes more dirt than you think and kills anything living in the carpet, however, if the carpet is fairly old... consider perhaps saving to replace it.  ~ Oriental rugs can also be professionally cleaned.  Take note of any damage it may have prior and perhaps take a picture of it before it goes to the cleaners.  Don't really want to see you on Judge Judy but it happens.<br>  <br>  *  When was the last time the curtains had been cleaned?  Dust collects way at the top of those things.  <br>  <br>  *  Have you ever considered a room purifier?  Those work wonderfully also.  Especially for children with asthma but you don't have to have asthma to use one.<br>  <br>  There are so many other places to dust as you know but the more you stay on top of it... the better you will ultimately feel in the future.  Perhaps if you are able to afford a one time maid service to help get you started, it may not seem so burdonsome.  Maybe even some friends who aren't as prone to allergies might be recrutible to help out... for a great dinner or some other affordable gift of your appreciation.<br>  <br>  I hope any of this helps and that you're able to breathe well soon.  Especially since the smells of Spring are about to come through.  Wouldn't want you to miss it!!<br>  <br>  PS... Once read somewhere "a house should be dirty enough to look lived in, but clean enough to be healthy."  Work on the healthy part.|`|EmgiGg17aa	One thing to note, is it mainly in your house or does this condition follow you no matter where you go.   I mean is it better while out in the yard, or in the cold garage or in department store?     If that is the case, that it is worse at home especially at night - then analyze your cleaning practices.  Do you clean?  Or is there dust there that you have not gotten around to vacuuming up yet.   I don't kid.  I have 4 vacuums and they are still on their first bags(in  many years).  I figure so long as I can tell what color it is, the dust ain't thick enough..      As it really did not bother me during the daytime(as I was never home) it stayed for later.<br>     So, needless to say it did surprize me when I was trying out a 5th vacuum cleaner I got donated to me(an upright see throough canister) model.   I filled the canister and did not even finish the bedroom.    Whoa, a bit of dust.   And that is without wiping down the walls or cleaning the door, etc, etc.|`|oojO4WAraa	Claritin - daily.<br>  <br>  Don't be too clean - too much cleanliness makes people allergic.

jdV5o8NMaa	You should be fine since it was the first week and you started right away on the next level.  How tri-cycline works is the hormone levels change each week to match your bodies natural hormone levels vs the same dose of hormones all month long. But make sure you follow the directions- same time everyday no skipping.  But my gyno told me when I was young not to use the ortho-lo( it uses less hormones) because he told me its not as effective in young girls just due to the higher hormone levels they tend to have and irregular schedules of their life and bodies.

It will help you lose weight, gain feminine muscle, help your skin, help your overall health, and it will endorse happiness! Also just watch how late you eat...dont eat past 6.

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|UPnyiX6aaa	plan your meals<br>  eat anything u want for breaky<br>  eat fruits and veges at skl for break<br>  and for lunch divide your plate into 3 sections: 1 third carbs, 2 third vege and fruit, 3 third anything else.<br>  dont eat dinner, but if u realy want to eat a fruit of vege<br>  hope i helped<br>  i lost 9 kilos this way in lyk 2 months|`|8rX2fSB5aa	Eat right and take these pills called T2 fat burners when you exercise at the gym.  You can get them at any health food or fitness store and they give you more energy and motivation to work out while helping digestion and gradually burning away fat.|`|a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	Step 1: Find out what your basal metabolic rate is. Go to: <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off-permanently.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weigh...</a> <br>  Ignore the advertisements there. This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the longest period of time while exercising. You have two targets a fat burn zone and an cardiovascular zone. The fat burn is usually 60% of your maximum and is easier to achieve and maintain and if your goal is weight loss this is where you want to be. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.<br>  <br>  Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance what you eat (equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible) . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/se...</a><br>  This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it won’t matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight. Great ideas for people on the go are: South Beach Cinnamon Raisin Cereal Bar(awesome snack, 150 calories, 10g of protein! 3g fiber you can not do better, also comes in Peanut Butter and Chocolate), Snickers Marathon Multi-Grain Crunch(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle), Snickers Marathon Protein Caramel Nut Rush(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle).<br>  <br>  Step 5: Balance! In what you eat. Make sure that you are eating Protein, Carbs, and Fiber in every meal. A great way to make sure you get the protein and fiber is Kelloggs Protein Water. It has only 30 calories but gives you 5g protein and 5g fiber for 20z. Go to Wal-mart they sell a 10 pack of the powder for ~$5.50. That way when you are eating a high carb food for a snack or meal you can still get the balance. <br>  <br>  Step 6: Smaller but more. Each smaller snacks more often instead of big meals. This really does work and will definately increase your metabolism. I eat a South Beach Cereal Bar every 2 hours all day then a good dinner. They keep me full and they taste pretty good. Caffiene is your friend. It is a natural appetite suppressant so have that cup of coffee!<br>  <br>  Step 7: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.<br>  <br>  Step 8(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).<br>  <br>  Step 9: Sleep, Never underestimate the power of a goodnight sleep. Will power can crumble in a second if your going through your day tired. You end up with a diminished sense of self control and tend to “give in” to temptation.<br>  <br>  Step 10: Find a distraction. Read a book, Ride a bike, Play a game. Whatever takes your mind off of food, do it. You will need something that you can turn to in a moment of weakness. Something that will distract you for a half an hour so that your will can reassert itself and help you to make a rational decision.|`|5I7Ifrmraa	First of all, dont use diet pills, they can be very bad for you.  You need to change your eating habits, more whole grains, fruits and veggies.  Don't eat right before bed and try to get at least 30 min of exercise per day.  Even ifs its just walking around the block a few times, it helps.  Lastly, if you crave a certain food, have a little, you don't need to be miserable to loose weight, just eat in moderation.|`|2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	NO PILLS! <br>  <br>  Any diet will not work unless you add exercise, both the long slow exercise like walking or swimming, but also weight or resistance based exercise like with weights or resistance bands.  <br>  <br>  Fast weight loss is bound to come back on twice as fast.  You need a complete change in your eating habits.  <br>  <br>  The last thing you want to do is go on a starvation diet.  That slows your metabolism down to where it holds onto the weight for your body believes it is starving.  Instead you want a diet that jazzes up your metabolism.  Instead of 3 or less meals a day, go for 5 or 6, but each meal is small, tiny.  <br>  <br>  You also want a low glycemic index diet.  Those you can find free ones here on the web.....you'll have to search a bit.  You want to eat foods that do not spike your blood sugar levels........so far less bread and potato but instead eat sweet potato.  Stay away from corn and corn products, also stay away from peas, cherries......all those little sugar pills that are so yummy.  <br>  <br>  Example of a day's worth of 6 mini meals: breakfast oatmeal (no milk) and an egg white omlet.  At 9 a.m. 1 ounce chicken with a lettuce and veggie salad (no dressing if possible...then minimal amount).  Lunch 2 ounes protein such as fish or chicken, green veggies, salad and a very small roll, no butter or rice instead of the roll)  3 pm snack of fruit and 5 almonds....no more than 5) and dinner like except put that sweet potato in instead of rice or roll.  Maybe you'll want the fruit and nuts at the 9 am snack, fine switch it around.  <br>  <br>  If you add up calories you'll be around 1200 which is the minimum you need to keep the metabolism up to super speed. <br>  <br>  Also exercise a minimum of 30 minutes, better 60 per day, break into chunks if you must.  <br>  <br>  Finally drink water, not sodas, not juice, not coffee or tea (you may have to wean yourself off the caffeine...that takes time) oh, and drink a lot of water...........60 ounces or more per day.  It keeps you filled up and washes out your system.|`|4CMx1uzXaa	diets dont work.<br>  just find a sport you enjoy and do it often.

Body fat can be cut by aerobic exercise. This will remove the layers of fat that covers the midsection. In order to increase the size of the abdominals, you should perform strength training. This will make them appear and look them better. In combining these two exercises, it can help get you a six pack the fastest way.

I don't know where you live but most counties do offer this service for people with no insurance.|`|qKA05EQTaa	<a href="http://www.1dental.com/dental-plan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.1dental.com/dental-plan.htm</a>    you can get insurance on your own for not too much money, it does not cover a huge portion but pretty good , for like 8$ per week, it is not impossible check out this website, just pick your state. there are other plans too you just have to look , you have a computer, you can find insurance.|`|O5KOwhovaa	You have to PAY to have your wisdom teeth removed in (I presume) the United States?<br>  <br>  <br>  This is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Are there no free clinics which offer dental services to people without insurance?
eRDwzcaOaa	Yes, if you are getting over a cold and your teeth were fine before you got sick, it may be just residual symptoms of your cold.  If it's multiple teeth or a general area, then that is probably the case.<br>  <br>  If it is one specific tooth that you can tell definitively is the one, then it may be the tooth.  In any case, I'd probably wait another week or two until your cold symptoms go away completely before worrying about your teeth issues.<br>  <br>  Pain when you chew is often indicative of a fractured tooth, but as we discussed, it may just be your lingering cold.
EV1Z1AWCaa	There is nothing you should hide from your doctor.  They shouldn't judge you.  They are there to help you.  Make an appointment and go see your Dr. ASAP.<br>  <br>  The doctor will be able to tell you if it's withdraw from the medication or side effects from the drugs.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you're smart enough to realize that meth is a horrible drug and that you will never try it again. Congrats on that.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	I would say your medications you take from the your dr suck first of all. i know i took hem, stop taking them and you will be fine, just from my experience with them.........|`|gf0tOrcpaa	Meth is a horrible drug.  You may want to do it again just to do it.  Thats how addictive it is, I suggest you NEVER try it again as you will easily get addicted and it will ruin your life completely.  As for the side effects stop taking all medication for a couple of days, get plenty of rest and liquids to help cleanse your body.  Eat fruits and veggies, then go ahead and start the lexapro again.  Hope this helps you out!|`|8ENRWmoMaa	well according to tv meth makes you body release about 3-4 times more endophin then the body can release naturally.  Enophin make you happy.  But the release though it feels good at the times overloads the the "pick up" for the endorphins and destroys them perminently.  the more you use meth the more get destroyed and the less naturla endorphin your body makes.  Careful thugh Meth is ultra addictive using only one time can get you hooked and like herorin its never as good as the first time.|`|kyUiaDgyaa	I honestly do hope that you learned something from that experience and I do hope that you do not repeat that same "STUPID" mistake again do you have any idea what that $hit is made out of ?|`|WJjr2E0haa	Well, of course you know the mistake that you made was doing meth anyway so I won't say anything about that but it sounds like your problems are going to be from the change or "lack there of" your meds. When my doctor has changed my meds (from lexapro to cymbalta) she had me actually lower my dose on the lexapro and take they lower dose cymbalta for a week. After that week I was to cut the lexapro in half and up the cymbalta for a week. Then I was to completely cut out the lexapro and take full doses of the cymbalta. She informed me that for 2 weeks I would not feel right, dizziness and other side effects. She was right. So you may need to talk to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Now the only thing that doesn't measure up here is the hallucinations. That is from the meth. Remember, meth and other drugs are cut with all kinds of different things. So you could have got some bad sh**. Meth is normally out of your system in 48-72 hours so you should be good on that. Make sure you are eating and getting enough to drink (not alcohol). Start taking your meds. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and I hope you feel better.|`|T497f0iwaa	I think you should discuss it with your doctor.   It's still early in the day.  I would call the doctor's office now, and leave a message for him to call you back. <br>  <br>  Your doctor is already managing you on strong medication.  Crystal Methane is an extremely strong chemical.  You have mixed two strong chemicals.<br>  <br>  Crystal Methane can ruin your life.  I suggest you never take it again.  It is not a drug you should even consider using "a few times a year" or "once a month." <br>  <br>  Who are the people who had this party, where Crystal Methane was available?  I suggest you cut these friends out of your life.  I would not continue to socialize with this group.  <br>  <br>  Call up some healthy friends, who don't do drugs, and plan to do something healthy this week, like go for a long walk, or rent some movies and make cookies.

For example, I was watching that show on survival from Discovery channel and they were warning about different colors on the snow. Some will get you sick if ingested.

Moisture forms around a dust particle in the air and then the combined weight of a couple of moisture particles is heavier than the dust and won't float anymore as gravity pulls it downward in the form of rain and snow(in the winter.   The dust could be from Siberia, or Australia, or from the foundry in the next town.     The dust could be dirt or car exhaust, or pollen.       <br>      If she was allergic to snow she would be allergic to water and as her body is 80% water, that would be unlikely.|`|6tw7g44haa	NO you cannot be allergic to snow, its just frozen water.|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	Snow is water, no different than the ice cubes in your freezer. However, because it is outside and not filtered in any manner, it can contain microscopic particles of things she might be allergic to - bacteria, pesticides from the yard, pollen from trees, etc.|`|3YJe5Z4Faa	Urticaria (hives) can be caused by exposure to cold in some people.  An interesting experiment might be to try an ice cube to the face and see if that causes the bumps too.  If so, you'll know it's not the snow per se but the cold temperature.|`|KLuLmLawaa	No, unless your allergic to water. But I don't know how that's possible. That's a weird situation.

zdu3gh8jaa	Stress and/or anxiety, a virus, high temperature, low blood sugar, lack of sleep, too much caffeine, caffeine withdrawal if you have previously drunk it in large quantities.<br>  All the above can cause the symptoms of shaking.

Lack of vitamin C or B12 could cause drastic change in your body metabolism. Perhaps it may be due to this reason. Vitamin C and B12 can be bought at your local drugstore over the counter, no prescriptions required.<br>  <br>  if symptoms persists, i suggest you go see a doctor.<br>  <br>  a regular dose of those one-a-day multivitamins would be a good thing to do.

djUMvICoaa	I only had to read your first paragraph to know what is wrong with you and you can keep going to the doctors and they will never get it right.  I've had some of the same problem pains all the times and being told there wasn't anything there. I had to figure it out.  Not even my chiro knew what was going on and that surprised me more.   But your accident is what caused them and it's the muscles in your neck that need help.  I just came home a week ago from visiting our grandkids and one said he had fallen down and now his head hurt.  I took a  feel at his neck and he told me when and where it hurt and in less than 5 minutes it was gone.  Write me.|`|mAp90hEeaa	With anyone who has migraines, it is trial and error to find the right combination of drugs that will work to keep the symptoms under control.  You have to keep going back and tell them that the meds you are taking are not working.  You might also consider finding a neurologist who specializes in migraine care.  In females, there can also be a relationship to your periods and the severity of the migraines and there can also be a food-induced component and keeping a food diary and the severity of the headaches noted might also help find some food triggers.  There is also a theory that mild, chronic dehydration contributes to migraines so you might try dramatically increasing your daily water intake for a week to see if that has any effect.  Eventually, they will find a drug combination for you that will work.  Almost all migraine patients get relief but it is often a long road.  Be persistent, keep working with your doctors and hopefully, you will find the right meds.  Every person's body is different and that is why it is a trial and error process to find the right combinations.|`|AA11758925	Think you should request a brain scan to look for something in there bad before its to late|`|44435ac38b755e42d6164067b0413d71aa	Severe headaches can be caused by many many factors such as allergies to dust and/or food, bad combinations of medication, muscle tension, depression and a host of other factors.  Have your doctors ruled out these other possible causes?  Did you have a thorough physical workup before having brain scans?  If not, you really owe it to yourself to take a step back and have that sort of physical checkup.|`|vdMUCHDKaa	i think i know how you feel, i constantly have a headache and feel dizzy most of the time.<br>  <br>  iv been seeing dr's for years about my headaches but i cant think of a single thing they did to help them. i saw a neurologist the other day and he did nothing either and he didnt help me with my sleeping problem which has realy annoyed me. the only thing that he said was that by taking lots of pain killers (or someting with codene in it) then they can lead to daily headaches. im taking like 20 a week and thats still to much aparently but wen i decided to not take them and let my headache not get better i was unable to sleep and had a constant and very painful headache for 3 days (not fun).<br>  <br>  lots of people are telling me to drink lots of water (hasent helped me).<br>  try not to eat chocolate or tomatoes since they are know to cause headaches as well aparently. sorry i couldnt be any more help to you.
BUI2nlUVaa	No, your doctor is wrong.  An ANA is a non specific test for an auto immune disease...maybe he thinks you have hemolitic anemia...hopefully not as this would be terrible.  However, an ANA would not be associated with an iron deficiency, not in the least.<br>  <br>  Your Lupus panel came back negative but that really doesn't mean too much.  Really the Lupus panel is used to rule Lupus IN, not OUT.  Only 30% of people with Lupus actually test positive for the Lupus panel.  This is why they say that there is no specific test for Lupus.  You should see the hemotologist and then ask to also be referred to a rheumatologist.  If your primary care doctor balks at this suggestion, let her know that if anything occurs as a result of his lack of attention then you're attorney will be calling her (this always gets the referral, by the way).  After you do this you'll have to put in a request with your insurance company to change primary care doctors, but who cares, she sounds like an idiot anyway.  <br>  <br>  Get copies of all your lab work.  Ask the doctor for them (before you threaten her with a lawsuit).  Have them make a copy so you can actually view the results.  Approximately 5% of the population test positive for ANA even without an auto immune disease, however this is a small percentage, so odds are you have some type of auto immune disease.|`|fMilDRgLaa	No. I have never heard of this either.  I have a high ANA 1:1280 speckled and homogeno pattern.  It was thought I had Lupus, but later we found out I had Sjogrens Syndrome....which mock the symptoms of lupus and other disease easily.<br>  <br>  I am surprised your Doc didn't refer you to a rhuematologist.  I would tell your Doctor to do that immediately.  If this is a rheumatologist that did the testing, then I would get a second opinion.<br>  <br>  You know your body more than any Doctor.  If you are feeling this bad....definitely go to a specialist that deals with high ANA's, titers, etc.  <br>  Hope you get back on the road of feeling better soon.<br>  <br>  BTW- I have iron deficiency too.
OUbNSXjJaa	Anxiety comes because of chain reactions. It starts with impure or imperfect thought patterns. It may start with some unwanted or undeserving desires in our mind. If the desire is not fulfilled, it leads to anger. Anger leads to frustration or irritation. Irritation leads to worry. Worry leads to loss of memory. Loss of memory leads to confusion. There would not be mental concentration either. All these put together gives anxiety. If you cut the root of such things in the beginning itself, you will be safe.<br>  <br>  Keep your mind pure, perfect and strong.<br>  <br>  You may consult a good doctor also.|`|0UUDFxR0aa	You need a doctors help!|`|UC8chYWlaa	Don't know what to tell u about the eating problem, but i have anxiety really bad and have panic attacks all the time. The only thing that i have found to help me is xanax. I have been on them for prolly 5 years now and i can't go a day without them. They help alot though. See if ur doctor will prescribe u some xanax.|`|a6sCffVMaa	Anxiety is caused by the excess secretion of a hormone known as Adrenaline. It appears your body secretes a very large amount of this hormone. But Oxygen decreases it's secretion. So to decrease it's secretion, whenever you feel like getting crazy, take a deep breathe and relax your entire body. Stay away from congested area and eat less of fatty foods rather more of protein. You MUST stop the taking of ALCOHOL for it only  inflames your liver, kidney and some other organs. The rest you feel it gives you, is just temporal and at the end of the day it causes you more than what you think it gives you. And I advice you to go see a doctor for medical check up.
0QZaukhyaa	I was in this position at one point in my life, and if i could give anyone advise about diet it is don't binge and purge...it totally destroyed my stomach and i have more stomach problems then probably any human being on earth! <br>  I felt the same as you did, like the only way to deal with stress was to eat as much as i could, i ate until i felt sick and fat and then would go throw it all up because when i did that i felt in control of myself again and it gave me this calming lightheadedness that for some reason felt soothing...that's as best as i can explain it. But because of doing this for 2 years over and over i developed the worst acid reflux. Pretty soon it was hard to even keep things down in my stomach, and my whole esophagus was constantly burning i felt like i had a huge ball in my throat that wouldn't go away. Because of this i know have the worst acid reflux and irritable bowl because my digestive tract could not digest things properly for so much time. But because of these two things i guess i have learned how to really watch my diet and exercise to prevent stress.<br>  <br>  Just take into consideration when you want to binge and purge how its going to affect your body later!!! Then go eat something healthy (yes even healthy stuff can be tasty), breathe, and eat it slowly one bite at a time!! Good Luck!!|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Exercise instead and try eating regulary instead of starving yourself. thats why you binje like that and then result to vomiting. Contact a local doc and set up an appointment.|`|47790329901dba8887db0c7f8d7b4d1faa	Ok Calm down. I'm 19 years old and i now weigh 125 and I used to have an eating issue as well. When you purge, that leaves no food in your stomach. Therefore, your body is going to hold on to the fat that's on your body, maybe even causing you to gain more weight. If u want to lose weight, eat healthy. As mentioned before i'm 19 years old so i know. I just switched to brown rice, whole wheat bread, more veggies and fruits, more water less pop and juice. Buy canned fruits and frozen vegetable, they last longer. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BINGE, binge on fruits, veggies, and water. No cookies, cakes, juices, sodas, chips, anything of that nature. There are PLENTY of healthy alternatives at fast food restaurants. Exercise too I do Tae Bo as often as possible! You should try it too! There are free vids on YoutTube. Good luck and stop stressing. It makes you gain weight trust me I know. I'm a college sophomore, with a job, and a fiancee who is a Marine. I know stress. Good Luck.|`|e3023972570bb415f2c1ec89bb3ac3e1aa	I'm not going to lie, it's going to be hard, and if you don't think you can do it on your own- you need to get help (therapist, eating disorder specialist)- but you really need to want recovery or it's going to be impossible. I have an eating disorder myself and have been trying to stop purging for the past month and a half. I just stopped cold turkey. the thoughts and needs were so strong at first, it was very very difficult, but I distracted myself. I made sure I ate only when there were people in the house so I couldn't purge, I read when I felt the need to b/p (binge/purge), I drank a lot of water, I listened to music, I went online.... you get the drift.<br>  the thing is, purging strains your body so much, it makes you ill and sick. I know you feel such a strong need, but when you do just try and distract yourself. the cravings will usually pass after around 15 minutes, and the first week will be the absolute hardest. just try and up your exercise levels and eat small meals spread out over the course of the day so you don't feel such a strong pull towards food.<br>  it IS all psychological, not physical. it's all in the mentality and you just need to tell yourself NO! I will not b/p.<br>  <br>  I haven't purged in a month and a half now (with a few exceptions when I just broke down) and it really gets a little easier as the days pass. I still suggest seeing an eating disorder therapist to help you get over this for good (maybe I should take my own advice?), but I really do hope this helps. good luck|`|uUbiu131aa	i had the same prob with binging when i was anorexic.. the best way to stop is to look in the mirror every morning and think to yourself "i will be beautiful if i eat what i need and NO MORE/NO LESS.  repeat the last words when you feel like purging or binging... and if you have to binge.. and i know this  will be really really hard.. just binge on drinks not alchol that will make you want to eat more... just get some soda... I know it seems bad to drink a whole 12 case of Coke or Pepsi but trust me, it will help... and after a while you will not even drink the whole thing... also they rarley make you fat if you drink them that fast<br>  <br>  Trust me on that I know...<br>  <br>  Also, don't worry about the weight you are gaining.....  How much do you weigh now? <br>  <br>  If your weight is really low, then all the weight is just your body re activating itself... your digestive system re-activating and opening up.. because when you purge the food doesnt get all the way through..<br>  <br>  Those pounds are just the reactivating and rebuilding of your body...<br>  <br>  The crazy feeling is from you not feeling "in controll"  it okay to feel a bit crazy... I know i did.  just try to controll something else... get a cat or a dog or something, feed it water it take care of it...play with it... ect...or plant a gardent(this is the best first choice if you live where you can't have pets or you don't feel like takeng care of one) <br>  <br>  Also this will distract you.. look at your garden while you are sipping the soda(not a diet unless you are frutose intolerent... the regular will give the illusion of eating)<br>  <br>  Just remember, its okay to eat, its okay to feel a bit crazy for food sometimes... but just try to do these things i said....<br>  <br>  Now if it doesnt work you may have to go to a therapist, or just go to the dr and say, i have a problem with randomly binging...you don't have to say you were bulimic, just that you have really big food cravings.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

y4SUDnpaaa	First of all why do you think you would need to tell your parents. You're entitled to your private thoughts. Secondly, you solve the problem of STDs by wearing a condom. Thirdly, it is perfectly normal at your age to be preoccupied with sex, especially if you are inexperienced and look forward to and dread at the same time your first sexual experience. I think your basic problem is shyness and a lack of self esteem. If I were you I'd see a therapist to get some professional advice on how to overcome these traits. You're not crazy or have a mental disorder you just need a little help in getting over your shyness. You can do it.|`|b8f0567cc965cfac3a2b7aa6564ba025aa	Perfectly normal teenager with raging hormones and good sense about s.t.d.

You won't be able to prescribe medications as a social worker, but you can't be a nurse practitioner with out being a nurse. If you want to be a therapist there are ways to do that with out going through a nursing program.  Also I'm not sure where you live but in NY there aren't any nurse practitioners who work in psychiatry out side of hospitals. You should check on things in where ever you live. IN the USA there aren't many people who can afford to do private practise because most people can't afford it. Insurance companies don't pay the going rate for private practise and private citizens can't afford it on their own.  I know psychologist, psychiatrist, social workers who have other jobs in addition to any private practices they have or they wouldn't be able to make enough money to support themselves.
Yyt8ZjU2aa	Aw... I'm so sorry, hun. Life can be so harsh and unforgiving sometimes. I know because I've dealt with ongoing depression throughout my life as well. All of the symptoms you've mentioned are classic signs of depression. Many people find solace in cutting for the same exact reasons you've listed. It helps people to cope with their internal pain by focusing on the external pain. It can be addicting, almost like a drug. I've been a long time cutter myself. Therapy doesn't work for everyone, so I'm not surprised it hasn't worked for you. I personally found it to be very superficial and insincere. No matter how uncomfortable it may be to bring up these issues with your mother, you must somehow muster up the courage to tell her. You simply cannot keep this from her any longer, she needs to be informed in order to help save you from yourself. Unfortunately, depression affects far too many teenagers and young adults. It can become increasingly serious if not treated early on. You don't deserve to be forced to suffer through this pain all alone. And I'm sure there are plenty of people (including your mother) who would give their left leg to make you feel better. You deserve all the help you can get. Good luck and best wishes! xox|`|HykE5X0Laa	You should talk to her right now!|`|ZH0R7Tfaaa	well.... i understand. obviously if youre in therapy your family is involved in some way. PLEASE: do me a favor and tell your therapist that therapy is not working for you and that you are still cutting yourself. talk to your therapist about different kinds of medications that might help you and your symptoms. good luck. really i wish you the best of luck and i know how hard it is to admit you need help especially to someone like your mother. best of luck to you.<br>  <br>  edit: i just read youre not in therapy.... ask your mother to schedule an appt. at your doctor and talk to your doctor. they can give you medication or refer you to a psychiatrist who will give you more accurate information. just remember all medication is temporary and the best person that can help you, is you. good luck.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	As  a mother who has a 16 year old daughter dealing with depression, I would say that you should just sit down with her and tell her that you're feeling worse than you ever have and that you need help.  IF for some reason she won't listen to you that Call your doctor or school counselor and let them know what's going on, One of them should be able to help you particularly your doctor.  As a medical personnel they would be able to get your mother to understand what you need and be able to get you the help that you need ASAP. You should talk to someone tomorrow as soon as you get up.|`|AA10500537	speak to yor school counceler  or your pastor.

I think you should be firm with him. <br>  <br>  Tell him that he can no longer visit your until he is completely sober. (You can tell him that you love him, too.) If you want to spend time with him, do so without your son at his place (or a restaurant), but if he's not sober, leave immediately. Make it clear that you only want to see him while he's sober.

TmYTjJT8aa	i think you need to see a doctor for this. at his age, the way he talks, acts, and is, depends on his surroundings. because he was with cayleb for a long time, he got used to cayleb's put-downs and is insecure himself. he has no interest in the other boys because he most likely thinks that they will treat him the same way cayleb treated them.|`|d34NoSGhaa	My psychiatrist started out as a pediatric psychiatrist. (he kept me because he loves me :) )  He sees children all the time.  I see them come into his office, different moods/types.<br>  I think you might want to take Cooper to see one. Or to a therapist.<br>  The time with Caleb has definitely caused a great impact on Cooper.<br>  Doesn't look like it was too good either.  He used to feel safe and outgoing remember. Sweet loving, etc... Then Caleb came alone and ruined that. No longer safe, can't be outgoing because whatever innocence he wanted to feel or say was stupid (little piggy comment). He's probably confused now and not too sure how to go BACK to being innocent.<br>  You are a great mom for loving Cooper so much that you are asking questions now.  Definitely think you need some help with this.  <br>  Good wishes to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  I just thought of something.  If I was getting bitten I'd be scared, my world of innocence would be ruined.  I would look to you for help too.  Don't think I would trust going back.  He probably doesn't want to be left alone (without you) because he doesn't want to be abused by other kids.  (my opinion).<br>  I'm already starting to hurt for him.  Best wishes to you and Cooper.

Anyway, they are nearly all given counselling, and antidepressants, then released soon after; it just costs too much to do more than that. A previous answer follows:  I went through a similar thing to you; it's important to realise that you are probably deeply depressed at present, but even so, you may still remember times when life was good. Well, it can be again, and soon: but you need treatment, which is readily available; all you have to do is reach out for it. See suicidal thoughts, and depression treatments, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris..." rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris...</a> in sections 5, and 2 (view page R first). Contact the hotlines provided.<br>  <br>  If the suicidal feelings become overwhelming, take a taxi, or call an ambulance, or use public transport, to take you to the nearest ER, or mental health facility, or call your local emergency number:  911 (USA & Canada), 000 (Australia), 999 (UK & Poland),  111 (New Zealand), 112 (Europe), & 119 (East Asia); see the phone book elsewhere, or Google: "emergency phone numbers". On GSM cellular mobile phone networks worldwide, it is 112; you may need a SIM card, and possibly require credit. <br>  <br>  Don't drive, yourself: you may well be a danger to others on the roads, in your current mental state. Too many people are found, and revived, but have suffered permanent mental damage, and live the rest of their lives in a semi vegetative state: their family, and friends feel guilty, and responsible, for not noticing the signs, and doing something about it. It's a very nasty thing for them to have to go through, too, even though I appreciate that life is certainly no bed of roses for you, at present, so please, get help, right now: seek assistance, or use the hotlines provided. <br>  <br>  It may induce those who cared about you to commit suicide, as well, or at least try, with undesirable consequences. Where suicide is involved, family, and friends often feel guilty, and responsible, for not noticing the signs, and doing something about it when there was still time.

wwP3ONCFaa	1 mg to 5 mg of melatonin is considered to be safe and sufficient. It is recommended to start taking melatonin supplements at low dosage from 0.3 mg then gradually increase your dosage up to 5mg until you find the effective dose. <br>  <br>  You may experience headache or an altered sleep pattern. Mental or mood changes may also occur as well as itching, fast heartbeat or heavy headedness. Melatonin may cause lowering of the body temperature. Vivid dream is also associated with melatonin use. <br>  <br>  If you have immune system disorder, diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease, stroke or depression you should consult first your doctor before taking melatonin supplements. You should limit alcohol consumption because it may aggravate some of the side effects of this medicine. Extra caution is advised when you are performing tasks that require alertness such as driving. It is not recommended to take melatonin if you are planning to have pregnancy. Melatonin is not recommended for persons UNDER 20 years old.|`|AA10674555	Should be no problem.

If you can get a hold of, or maybe ask your doctor about it, Reglan, or Domperidone which is a compound, and not approved by the fda, helps with nauseousness. Reglan is used in ER's for the usual immediate nausea caused by morphine. It works very well. I know this because, when I was breast feeding my son, I was taking domperidone for milk production, and when I stopped breast feeding him, I started the lithium and my doctor told me that I could use the domperidone for the extreme nausea that I was having. It really worked. I chose domperidone over reglan because reglan has a lot more side effects like twitching and tightening of the neck and jaw spasms. The only thing was that it is a bit pricy. The only nausea-stopping thing better than these two  is marijuana.|`|M1TgnTR6aa	why not ask the dr for a pill like prilosec to go with it?goodclu ck

Plan B is a good option when you need it but it also can be pretty hard on your body (normal side effects include nausea, vomiting, diherrea and irregular menstruation among other things) ... so I wouldn't recommend using it unless it's absolutely necessary (like you missed your pill for a couple days and then you have otherwise unprotected sex).

Flat feet (or low/fallen arches) can lead to over-pronation, a biomechanical imbalance that may cause serious problems over time.  When people who suffer from over-pronation stand or walk, the arches collapse with every step they take, and the ankles roll inwards.  Pronation itself is not wrong as we need to pronate and supinate as part of our gait. Pronation (rolling in) acts as a shock-absorbing process and supination (rolling out) helps to propel our feet forward.<br>  <br>  Flat feet or fallen arches may lead to uncomfortable, and even painful conditions such as plantar fasciitis and heel spurs. The most effective treatment solution for over-pronation is to wear an orthotic shoe insert.<br>  <br>  For more information please refer to links below.

Or why not suggest you and  only your FAMILY go somewhere? out to eat maybe? bowling? something. theres no way around this, but you or your family have to tell them that you want some time with just the family and go out......example>>> <br>  <br>  your family: hey umm we've decided that we're gonna have a family outing tomorrow but maybe on thursday you two should stop by and hang out with us.<br>  <br>  moms friend and daughter: oh cool, thats fine, have fun, we'll be here thursday.<br>  <br>  buuuuut, if they say some $hit like,"oh we'll come too" SOMEONE has to stand up and say nicely," no we thought we'd do the whole family thing tomorrow" thats it. theres no other way to put it. if you dont stand up and make yourself clear, they're gonna keep doing it because you allow them too.<br>  <br>  and thats it. they shouldnt take it personal. after all they've been there all this time! its not right. bottom line. No one should be allowed to make someone so depressed hat they're  a prison in their own house.<br>  <br>  wish you the best of luck.<3<3<br>  <br>  if you need someone to talk to, email me<br>  babycandy82@aol.com<br>  <br>  im 18 from NY  =)|`|NPhepcBkaa	No, it makes perfect sense!<br>  Try to get past this, dont do anything silly<br>  xxx|`|ijuPWHMdaa	im vary miss you baby  haw are you my hany|`|cd8ff0f053ce1a2e1b3303ea5ec2f1c7aa	First of all, I don't think anyone has the right to tell someone whether their reason for being depressed is valid or not. I mean, you can't help the way you feel right? I think its wrong for your mom to think you are 'weird' for feeling the way you do. Sometimes parents don't realize decisions they make or how they treat their kids affects them psychologically. You need to have a serious heart to heart talk with her. Tell her exactly how you feel. You should write your thoughts down in a journal too. Thats therapeutic. Also, maybe you should pick up a hobby that allows you to be away from home for part of the day. If you need to talk in the future, I am here too. Stay strong.|`|awpuswhcaa	Your mother's behavior is strange.  She's the one with the problem.  I can understand why you can't handle it. We all need privacy in our own homes and it is being denied to you.  You need to discuss it with a counsellor and try and have a family conference.|`|koQ8H19Zaa	it depends from person to person|`|5DP859Gxaa	Funny story I have had a situation like that before. Long story short my mom kicked my dad to the curb,for her new boyfriend. Then she let my cousin move into MY room,and set my stuff out in the living room. <br>    I came up w/ my own solution I moved out.<br>  Why dont you try to move in with your dad,or a family member,or a friends house? <br>   After you take care of yourself then worry about patching things up with your mom|`|zcZGRPc2aa	no it's a perfectly normal reason to. i think maybe your mom needs to focus on the needs of the family. sometimes friends can get in the way to much and it sounds like thats exactly what has happened. if she won't ask them to leave then maybe one day when they are gone you can simply suggest hey mom you know it seems like we never get to do anything just the two of us anymore and maybe suggest a mom/daughter shopping day or spa day or movies, dinner, anything else you can think you'd like to do with her. always worth a shot.|`|MfcTIdlraa	There is NEVER a stupid reason for being depressed.  I seems as though your mom has not only given up on your dad, but on the rest of your family as well.<br>  Try to remember that it takes 6 week for anti-depressant medication to kick in start doing any good.  If it has been longer than that, talk to your doctor and maybe you can have a change in your meds.<br>  Take your mom to the side and TELL her what your problem is.  She must know how much this situation is disturbing your life.<br>  You didn't mention your age, but if you are old enough, you can opt to live with your dad or with a good friend by declaring yourself an emancipated minor.  I'm quite sure you need a parent's signature to do this.  It's a thought, if speaking with Mom or Dad doesn't work.<br>  Good luck!|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	No, this is not a bad reason to be depressed.  There is never a "bad" reason to be depressed.  You cannot always help how you feel, but you can help how you try and fight it.  It's good you're on some medication, but it sounds like it may not be the best one, because it's not working for you.  <br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor about trying another medication, or combining it with another medication like Abilify.  Sometimes it just takes the right combination of medications to get you feeling better again.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you're hurting.  Your family is not the family that you're used to anymore, and it sounds like you're not getting the love or attention that you were used to.  That would make anyone feel pretty bad. <br>  <br>  Along with talking to your doctor about your medications, I would also try and speak with your family about this.  They may not even know you're hurting.  If you're honest with them, you may see some change in their behaviors.  Family is all we've got.  They should support you through this, and other challenges in life you will come across.  <br>  <br>  I hope you find that peace you're looking for, and deserve.
YCXxP43Laa	These aren't enough symptoms to go on! It could be a personality disorder, as some of them can be destructive, it could be stress. There are a myriad of mental conditions and those symptoms alone are not enough to diagnose. Borderline personality tends to self harm (which pulling hair could be seen as) when they fell frustrated or threatened with abandonment. Destroying things could be several... as well as sheer spite. With schizophrenia people tend to have psychotic features i.e hearing voices, thinking they are somehow special, having a unshakable belief in their own power, paranoia, sometimes just losing touch with reality and not dressing or feeding themselves.<br>  Bipolar would have marked mood swings, feeling euphorically high, talking faster than usual, jumping around in conversations, spending more than usual, risk taking. Feeling invincible, and being creative, at other times they have crushing lows,which manifest as depression.<br>  It could be anything and only a psychiatrist can diagnose so get a referral from your doctor.|`|uly3aFqtaa	Don't look for symptoms.<br>  If everyone looked for symptoms of Mental Disorders in themselves and eachother, we'll all be diagnosed with numerous 'mental disorders' and put on multiple medications that aren't even necessary.<br>  <br>  As far as i'm concerned, she just seems frustrated and angry. <br>  <br>  Xx.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Either or none.

It kinda sounds like maybe she just needs some anger management.  If these symptoms only happen when she is frustrated or angry I would say anger management.  If emotions are all tangled and symptoms appear all over the place then maybe depression/bipolar.  Keep in mind that telltale signs of bipolar are the highs and lows - the lows are like normal depression (somewhat) feeling guilty, sad, crying, etc; then the highs are usually spending money you don't have, being over excited about something, huge burst of unexplained energy, etc.|`|xnZi0i8saa	Neither...... She has problems with anger. Please do not assume that because someone throws angry fits that they are bipolar or schizophrenic..... Do a little research first..... Assumptions like this are why those of use with bipolar are feared and looked down upon.
AA11330407	Go to Wal-Mart their prescriptions are only $4.00 for generic brands. Have her doc prescribe the generic equivalent of whatever he prescribed originally. As for the stomach pain, it could be something unrelated to the flu she had. It's possible to have more then one infection at a time. I had a sinus infection and a cold at the same time last week. If the pain is severe she should really go to the doctor and have it checked out. If it's mild let whatever it is run it's course. True influenza has no effect on the stomach, it affects the respiratory system. The only reason a person should have nausea with the flu is if a lot of mucus is swallowed.|`|QTgm2ZTvaa	try going into a doctor again..<br>  <br>  it might get worst

Getting feelings that you have to be with them isn't and isn't healthy.  You might have to back away from boys for a while and Let the dust settle so you can get your head on straight.  If you've been jumping from one relationship to another it clouds your thinking especially of what you expect in a relationship.  Or at least you will have to look at what you're in and figure out what is missing that you would have feelings like that towards other people.  A good secure relationship shouldn't have you feeling that way, you should only be looking at your mate, he should be filling those voids for you.|`|AA11967904	Your still young and yes those meds could make a diff|`|vwZvxNevaa	No you're not alone.

84jaeplzaa	Dont get upset this is normal, you lose the most and fastest weight the first week. Then things slow down a bit when your body gets used to routine. Then it also matters about the time you wiegh yourself. You may weigh less in the day time than at night so you have to take everything in account. The best thing i can tell you to do is drink your 640z of water, cut out soda chips, etc and make sure you eat breakfast(slim fast) within 30minutes of waking up (kickstarts your metabolism) and dont eat any later than 7 (8 pushing it) this will give your food time to digest ( the scale will tell you how your doing) and personally you dont have to do this but i dont check the scale weekly (if ever) i see results in my clothes. The scale is something that will play with you head. You can feel physically fit and that damn scale will still day " hey your 5 lbs over weight" but just make sure your drinking the water and have fun with this|`|HF1TfsnTaa	Don't purchase any thing form the web site that the other people are telling you about,the tea's and all that stuff is crap. They work for and are distributors for those companies who prey on desperate people who will do anything to lose weight. You've probably hit a plateau. It happens to everyone who starts dieting. Your body isn;t used to the lower calorie intake and all the exercise so it thinks it is starving and protects itself by storing the calories. Amazing huh? I gained 40 this past year after i quit smoking. I feel and look awful but i can't stop eating and I have no energy to work out. I know what I have to do I just don't feel like doing it. Any advice.

My wife had a hard time exercising when she first started WW, but she made sure that she did 20-30 minutes of walking 3 times a week. Now she is addicted and is on the tread mill for over an hour a day plus does 200 sit up, cardio and strength training. She is in the best shape she's ever been thanks to WW.

Now you have made a very mature choice that you should be so very proud of yourself for. You may be only adjusting to new people and situations this would cause you to hold back a little of yourself until you really feel comfortable with your new friends. There new and you are just newly experiencing who they are and you are in the process of doing the same thing. It is like moving to a new school and the process of learning who could be a possible friend and who you choose not to hang around with. You're are only holding back until you really feel a part of the new group and get to know them. Don't worry this is all perfectly normal and it takes a little time to open up the way you did with the other group. You made a good and right decision, keep that in mind!|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Sorry for my language, but how the h*ll can anyone else know what you are really feeling and thinking?  I can't look inside your mind.  I'm saying in a joking way, in case you can't tell from the typing.  :)  It sounds like you're uncomfortable with this new crowd.  You don't think they really want to be your friend.  I always had a small group of friends, I mean SMALL like 1 or 2 close friends, my whole life, who I shared things with.  The rest are just for acquaintance, as you said, just the less intimate type of friend but might still be there occasionally for you if you need them to be to jump start your car or borrow something from or go to a party with.  No offense, but it's not clear...  I don't know if you're saying that you're gay or what?  Are you uncomfortable still or just did it?  That could be part of the problem, part of your anxiety.  You need to develop who YOU are and don't worry about those other people and which group you belong to.  Don't let them get you down or make you do things you don't want to.
QjP2qtSnaa	Real true friends are very hard to find.  You'll know it when you find one.  Otherwise, you will just have acquaintances.  See a counselor if you think you have problems forming relationships.
AGKxNYBeaa	Yes. You are probally in a mind-set now where to keep most things to yourself and you worry that if you open up to someone about how you feel they will hurt you (stab you in the back, laugh etc), it is not an easy thing for everyone to open up to people- but it is a good thing to be able to tell someone how you feel or just having someone their to speak to. You just need to get to know people in more depth and you will start to trust them, it could be a slow process but it is worth it.|`|jUgiyJe9aa	well I think a person can only be used so many times before they give up believing that there is anyone worth trusting out there anymore .... but if you only talk like this and present yourself like this .... it may will change ones you meet the right people ... maybe just move somewhere and make a brand new start where no one knows you and your past .... I don't think you really changed like this inside you cause otherwise a question like this would not be in your head .... you just had enough of being used and whenever you need someone no one is there .... but it will get easier again as soon as you run into some people where you feel and see they really care ....good luck|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	You seem to have issues communicating with others any more than skin deep.

giZNTxWQaa	apply vitamin E, or better still order some pure coco butter and apply directly to the would, you can get at ebay stores or any beauty shops. Its very effective on fresh scars. wish you luck|`|jZEKZdJGaa	firstly you have to cover it, it will scar less is you put a plaster/band aid on it. You can buy scar flattening plasters/band aids which work too. Don't bother with bio oil or any of those creams that claim to help scars/stretch marks disappear. A good dose of sunshine or small bursts on a tan bed can also help. Using a tanning bed helped me hugely when I had and appendectomy scar, it faded in a few weeks. You have to realize though that most scares will only fade, they will rarely go away forever|`|KxO4YSEHaa	dont pick it and leave it then it shouldnt scar your skin|`|C3sqTngtaa	should've thought about that before you butchered yourself!! sorry i just dont get why you would do it.
CRHlMPTUaa	Stress can cause a lot of it. Another thing can be that your pores are getting clogged. your skin cells shed every day and it could be causing your pores to clog.|`|OHIt2Gsgaa	Usually a combination of reasons - but mainly diet and hormones.  These not much you can do about the latter (except see you doctor) but you might try adjusting what you eat.  I find that acidic foods make me more susceptible to 'right beauties' as you put it.  Try cutting down on refined sugar and acidic foods like tomatoes and concentrated fruit juices...|`|wNUvIhbtaa	it's because you don't eat regularly and equilibrate. it's not about cleanliness at all.
Y6YrRo7Uaa	When my life went out of control, and my manic depression acted up worse than ever, sometimes I would try to starve myself to death, but always just gave up after a few weeks. This may be the problem, but anorexia just doesn't look like the problem here. Usually there is more emotional effects, like obsessing, and outrages to follow anorexia.|`|VHybyedbaa	it sounds like he has an anxiety problem on to off the depression,this would coz appatite loss,also appatite loss is a common side affect for anti dippresants.|`|g2h6qUUXaa	i think he is get him to a doctor before the depression and not eating gets out of control
9ko5WUFkaa	No - it's really not.  And there are plenty of doctors that (usually secretly) agree that it's not so bad (I work for doctors and they say it's not so bad but they can't say it publicly because of possible bad publicity).  I'm bi-polar too and my doc actually recommended it.  I know there's been times it has saved my life and anything that does that can't be bad.<br>  <br>  The real truth is that it is not a dangerous drug.  Fine, you shouldn't drive while on it, but you can't drive when you've been drinking either and alcohol is far more dangerous.  No-one, ever, has died from smoking pot - you can't overdose on it to the extent it kills you.  Millions die from alcohol every year.  OTC painkillers kill more people every year than all the illicit drugs put together.  Fine, pot's not great for your lungs (nor are car exhaust fumes), but nor are cigarettes and adults can buy them anywhere.  And who smokes anywhere as much pot as a cigarette smoker smokes tobacco?<br>  <br>  The links between pot and mental illness are fairly misreported also and are pushed by the anti-drug lobby.  There is no strong evidence that pot use causes depression and other mental illnesses, but there is strong evidence that people with these conditions use it to self-medicate.  It really does make people feel better.  The same goes for schizophrenia - it may trigger it, but the person already has it and just hasn't had a recognised episode.  If the pot doesn't trigger it, something eventually will.  It can help people with many conditions, from depression to cancer to MS to AIDS to anorexia.  It doesn't interact with many drugs and usually doesn't have a negative effect with anything it does interect with.<br>  <br>  It is a natural plant - apart from drying it out, there is nothing added to it in order to smoke it.  Really, it's a herb.  If people smoke other 'herbs' like damiana or passion flower then they are just said to be smoking herbs, even though they do have mild psychotropic effects.  Drugs are those horrid chemical concoctions that doctors push and that thousands of people are addicted to and die from.  Pot is not a drug.  You can not become physically addicted to it - though you can get a mental dependance - there are no nasty withdrawal effects when stopping use.  <br>  <br>  I could go on (I'm a bit passionate about the legalisation of this wonder herb) but that'll do for now.|`|yWUIMiyyaa	Hell no....the only reason that weed was made illegal is because at on time it was the top provider for the fuel we used in our cars,food,clothing,etc.   and when oil companies started to get worried that's when they made it look like a horrible thing when really we used it for alot of things and one of the main reasons we used it also was for MEDICAL USAGE ......so enjoy, no worry's, don't listen to that bullshit and remember the gov made LSD and then made it illegal because people were having to much fun.|`|i3PGjRRfaa	ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Only a dummy would think that smoking pot isn't bad for you - so keep on smoking.............|`|jVUEohsNaa	Heck, why listen to a doctor?|`|AA11309601	I don't know about the chemical interaction between pot and these powerful medications. However, in the past ten years I have worked with several psychiatrists and all of them were stoutly opposed to mixing meds and pot. Those who mixed them anyway had "wonderful" rationalizations to back their behavior, invariably they suffered more severe regressions and interpersonal problems.|`|R1jgGJ0Naa	Pot is non-addictive, you can't overdose, cheap, won't give you cancer, and makes everything better.  There isn't much wrong with it.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	my doctor doesnt say its bad..it works for my glaucoma<br>  he agrees|`|YG8J5xA5aa	No one has ever died from weed, the only way weed is dangerous is if you smoke it with tobacco and yet cigarettes are still legal. alcohol is also legal though it kills more people than most drugs put together.<br>  All the twats saying weed is terrible it gives you schizophrenia, its ******* ridiculous i am a psychologist and i know that if you get schizophrenia, its becasue you already had the gene for it in you and its possible weed triggered it, but almost anything can trigger it such as shock.<br>  Weed helps so many illnesses that other medications cant and yet it is illegal.<br>  so my answer is no.
mmMgfhf2aa	Sounds like you've encountered some callous, viscous people. I don't know many people who would call someone 'ugly' to their face. However, if your health workers are helping you because you are mentally ill or depressed there's no way you'll be referred for plastic surgery. You have to be of sound mind before you go ahead with cosmetic surgery. I know it sounds like a chicken and egg problem but you have to work on yourself mentally and show that you aren't putting your hopes into cosmetic surgery as a complete cure for all your problems.|`|9ed44342f109934ea75c69a84a787cc5aa	I have checked out your 360 page and I can honestly say that you are not at all ugly, (I am female and can be a bit critical).<br>  I would echo the other responder and say that you may be too hard on yourself because you are a little depressed.<br>  I think that the way you project yourself can influence the way others see you and how they react to you.<br>  <br>  I am sad to say that I watch Eastenders, I think the 'heather' character is great even though she isn't the best looking.<br>  Look after yourself.|`|NHkINK6baa	You are not ugly at all!  I know words can be damaging but please try to ignore hurtful people who say things like that that are just not true.  Take care and be kind to yourself.
K1iUzewyaa	well, just don't mess with it. Leave it alone. If it looked like a pimple, and you know for sure, I would pop it, especially if it was white, and had to go to school. But if you can, leave it alone, place a warm rag in the microwave (Wet rag) until warm. Maybe 30 seconds. Then, get some salt, and sprinkle it on the warm wet rag. Place that warm rag over the boil. It should expedite  the healing process, and draw some of the toxins out of the boil/ pimple faster.|`|CRHlMPTUaa	Sounds like it could be one of two things. Sounds like it is a cold sore. don't pick at it!  It also sounds like it may be a pimple b/c you said that it looks like it is kinda white. what ever it is don't pick it or it will get infected. Then you will have a big sore. Put some abreva on it and hopefully it will heel soon.|`|AA10044154	Sounds like it might be the start of a cold sore.  Does it tingle?  There are some products you can get to help it heal.  Abreva is a good one.|`|yNV2kRlbaa	That'd be a cold sore. You should get abreva (i know, it's expensive, but sooo worth it) and use it right away. And keep it for next time.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	Its a pimple that hasn't come to the surface yet.  We mostly get pimples because our bodies are deficient in nurtients.

Also, if you take aleve it will take down the swelling.|`|A4G03Bzbaa	either a canker sore or a cold sore (herpes of the mouth)

Although yours might be slightly different depending on where you are getting it done... <br>  <br>  I had to get mine out when I was 17, and they had to do it in the hospital because I had to be given IV fluids due to my heart (anastesia can have a adverse effect with me)...<br>  <br>  But normally they will do it in an outpatient and it really is fine..  All of my siblings get theirs out and they were all eating pizza the first night! haha <br>  <br>  Just try to relax, it wont be bad, just listen to the docs they will tell you what you need to do...  and remember those lovely pain killers they give you afterwards makes everything feel very dreamlike and happy!  :-b<br>  <br>  Good luck! Hope I helped!|`|scX6smKVaa	oh you will be fine and as you are young you will recover in no time!!<br>  <br>  Once the op is done it will just feel like you have a sore throat.<br>  <br>  You have nothing at all to worry about hun!!|`|EoroQbCraa	I had them out when I was 13 (am 14 now) and I didnt bleed too much.  I hurt for about a week after wards b/c they messed it up a bit, and i had to be transferred to children's hospital in dc for them to fix it.  but i am fine now. (and i dont get sick as much!!!!  :]  )  but, i recovered fairly well.  you will definitely be ok...try not to stress too much, or else that could affect your surgery/healing time too.  good luck!<br>  <br>  PS.  they let you keep your bra on and your panties...but that's it.  :)
3JUKOGOvaa	You are right! Seroquel is a very scary drug. It is given to so many patients for every illness imaginable and it sucks! It wipes out creativity and makes u a zombie. thank god i am not on it anymore. I stopped it like 3 months ago and am feeling better than I have in years...so yes your creativity does come back but remember it takes time!!|`|27gxjVJnaa	Seroquel is a mood staberliser. <br>  <br>  SEROQUEL is approved to treat the depressive and acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder and long-term maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder in combination with lithium or divalproex.<br>  <br>  SEROQUEL, pronounced SER-O-KWELL, is a mood-stabilizing medication approved by the FDA to treat both the highs and lows of bipolar disorder.1<br>  <br>  <br>  I will email you if I find anything about efecting creativity.<br>  hope this helps|`|YXGdwwTJaa	I have looked this up and see that, although Seroquel is occasionally used for bi-polar it is normally an anti-psychotic, used for schizophrenia, when people lose touch with reality.<br>  <br>  It should not only be used for those who hear voices, as this can be a common condition and is not necessarily harmful, unless the sufferer acts on evil suggestions from thes voices,  but also for those who live a life of fantasy and should seek help for this.  Unfortunately as they cannot tell the difference it is hard for them, or their loved ones, to notice that there is a problem, especially if they can hold down a job.  Walter Mitty was a good film,  and funny, but in real life these fantasists can be dangerous.|`|wE8NppnLaa	I took Cipralex for 6 months, which among other things is to prevent "mild psychotic episodes".

dMqytjONaa	Well some of this may depend on your diet. You can be doing tons of cardio, but if your diet does not reflect that same goals that you are trying to achieve in the gym, then it can take a lot longer to reach your goals.<br>  <br>  You need to know what you daily calorie intake requirements are. Then by creating a deficit in your calories through diet and exercise the flabby weight will come off. It doesn't happen overnight and does take some time and effort, which is why always seems so easy to put it back on then take it off, if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  This site covers some great info between learning how to balance diet and exercise together to help people lose weight|`|jiZ8WltPaa	Visit your doctor.....I am having the same problem....I got gym everyday, most times twice a day, and had a lot of problems losing the weight and the sag in my arms.....my doctor referred me to dietitian, and he helped me figure out some great exercises that helped....also my doctor gave me some meds that helped me, because I'm diabetic.....maybe you have a health issue that is not helping you with the fitness.|`|VnqPrEXPaa	Snap!! I go to gym, do body combat, taekwon-do, and still have a slight tum!! I dont think that you can get rid of all of it, i know how you feel tho.

Ve6RAuq3aa	not only ur liver, alcohol damages brain cells (which never grow back or repair) and it can cause cirrosis of the liver, which can lead to complications and even needing a liver transplant (which if ur an alcoholic is almost impossible to get)<br>  <br>  alcohol can damage other organ systems, and becoming intoxicated (drunk) leads to even more ways u can damage ur health (drink driving, fights, rape etc)<br>  <br>  alcohol is an unnecessary poison and ur body doesnt need it, so dont drink, give urself an extra 10 years of life, and learn how easy it is to enjoy urself without the useless toxin|`|kdqcgZjvaa	you can fall off a balcony and die or choke on your own vomit, but drinking in moderation is probably alright...It's the alcoholics who have to worry about their liver.|`|zn8TzZrJaa	Alcohol(which is in beer) damages the liver. The liver does repair itself though. But when you drink a lot of alcohol, the liver gets more exhausted, and has trouble repairing the holes and burns from alcohol.<br>  Eventually it gets worse and worse.<br>  Also beer has a lot of calories, and such, which could contribute to weight gain, and the chance of diseases and heart attacks.|`|AA12383579	The number two risk factor (after smoking) for cancer is alcohol. We use it to relax, but it hurts us. We poison ourselves in order to be happy? Drink even one beer and take a look at a slice of your liver under a microscope, you'll see death to liver cells. This is because the liver is trying to keep the poisons out of your bloodstream, and although the liver has the power to regrow, do we have to kill some liver cells in order to be happy? There just might be another option, a safer one.|`|H9RTbhKYaa	Because it contains alchohol, which is poisonous.|`|msoDXmvuaa	um im an alcoholic and i ahm  fiujinee seeoeee|`|14ZGrmZcaa	it can harm your liver|`|DXotNZ9eaa	Well, You lose like have of whats inside ur brain, I know this dude ( friend of my teacher) he came to out class also said he started drinking to much, When in college he still learning how to read.

94NYYq5Haa	stop thinking about it.  You probably imagine some of the pains, which makes them pretty real to you.  Stress and anxiety can also cause a lot of pain and sickness.Try to keep yourself busy with a hobby or work or something.  Pick an activity that you can really get absorbed in.  You'll feel a lot better if you can stop worrying for a while|`|a4IR6tYqaa	A long and confusing answer, but a lot of it depends on what you are worrying about and why.  You could easily be responding to very realistic stress in an unrealistic manner.  It could be you are unrealistic in what these stressors are and being unrealistic in the response.  If you are to the point of making yourself sick then you probably have not learned how to deal with the stressors in your life and how to solve problems.  <br>  <br>  You obviously need to talk about what ever is going on in your life and depending on your age and situation it will vary.  Biggest issue is to start looking at what is going wrong in your life and start addressing it.  Talk to professionals or a trusted friend or adult (if you are young) or clergy or someone who is not out in left field somewhere.  Deal with it now before it gets control over your total life.........which it sounds like it may already be doing.  <br>  <br>  If no one else is available drop me a message and I'll give you some ideas depending on your situation and environment.|`|zcZGRPc2aa	the best thing to do about the worry or stress is let go of it for as long as you can. usually when my husband gets stressed out we take a drive to the beach and stay a night on the weekends. usually picks him right up so my suggestion is that maybe you do something to take your mind off of this thing you are stressed or worried over.|`|5DP859Gxaa	Try meditating.

94NYYq5Haa	Its going to make you feel like crap.|`|AA10723498	What do you mean getting drunk couldn't be avoided.  It can always be avoided.  The reason they say not drink alcohol with the antidepressant is because alcohol is considered a drug, and is a sedative in it's own right so taking the two is inadvisable.  However, they are really talking about getting drunk.  Having a glass of wine when you come home is actually good for your heart.  Getting drunk or drinking hard alcohol while on any antidepressant is bad for you and could cause a reaction with the drug. I said this in another question and this applies to you as well.  These drugs affect the dopamine receptors in your brain, so does alcohol, so the effects of both can be like having a very high alcohol content in your body even though you may not drink as much.  So yes, avoid the hard liquor, stick to 1 glass of wine and be careful.|`|y9tMWuQjaa	Don't take drugs on antidepressants.<br>  <br>  I smoked pot on sertraline and had a fit!<br>  <br>  I got drunk on three antidepressants - paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram with no major adverse events. The hangover wasn't even as bad.<br>  <br>  I am taking Trazodone but I daren't drink because it is a highly sedative one that I'm new to.<br>  <br>  If a glass of wine helps you, then do it.

uvAjFW8Yaa	Sounds like a temporary 'depression' triggered by the extra stress you are having to cope with.  All teenagers experience mood swings as the hormone levels in their bodies surge and fall.  So not only are you dealing with what seems to be uncontrollable emotional changes, you have also taken on huge responsibilities (the store).<br>  <br>  Sounds like some good advice from the reply above - definitely go check it out.<br>  <br>  And in the meantime, you need to de-stress yourself.  You can use any method that is suitable for you.  Are you into yoga or meditation?<br>  Your mom should be able to help you with relaxation techniques.  Talk to her if you have a good relationship with her.  Failing that, make sure you go for a walk or paint or listen to music - or whatever activity you really enjoy.  Maybe you are not setting aside enough time for yourself.  We all need breathing space, time to recharge our batteries.  You are using a lot of your energy but not allowing yourself to recover.<br>  When you get the balance right you will feel enthusiastic and love life again.<br>  Good luck :D|`|T497f0iwaa	Try to exercise more, and get outdoors in the sunlight!|`|Wf5k8kYQaa	What you have to realize to is that a lot of it can be due to lack of nutrients. Vitamin B (of all kinds) deficiency, Magnesium deficiency, Vitamin D (sun) deficiency and many others like Vitamin C deficiencies and Zinc can help cause depression. Also make sure you are sleeping well. Eat when you’re not hungry, go out when you don’t want to. You need someone to push you to do these things so tell someone and don’t be ashamed because most of the US is in depression. Aromatherapy also is good for you. (Find things that smell good and put it around you i.e. perfume). Exercising even when you don’t want to gets your endorphins going (your energy level gets higher.) Another thing, energy produces energy remember that. And finally therapy, not actually going to a therapist, but just talking it out with someone that will listen. And if you can't get that done take a certain time in a day that you would like to write down what you are feeling and what made you feel that way. Don’t let it get worse i am helping someone get out of depression she is cooperating and so far so good.<br>  Work out a plan and do it!!!!!!|`|yMYIIOnKaa	It is possible to be both stressed and depressed because one often leads to another! If you feel bored by everything, maybe quite numb emotionally, or like most things don't seem to have  point to them, you could be depressed. Congratulations with the shop! You can alleviate your symptoms by reducing stress here, though. Stay dedicated but try to keep your work and home life separate, and don't forget that you can ask for help if you need it, it doesn't make you any less of a person. You are lucky to have a psychologist for a mum! Talk through your concerns with her: she will probably be the best person to help, and talk to your friends about it, too. They can support you and you can grow closer by sharing these feelings.<br>  Good luck with everything!|`|qGDWbJKpaa	Most of the signs of depression are shown in almost all teenage kids. Every teenage kid thinks they have depression. If you have days where you dont smile, you sit on your bed and just lay there not doing anything, you starve yourself/over eat too much, those are more server signs. If you started feeling this way, you will need medication.<br>  <br>  Depression is very common in teenagers your age and you also have stress that most teenagers dont have and will never have with your store. As long as you can handle it and not let it slip through your fingers, you should be good. You need something to take up your time if you have depression.|`|HPpdcAtAaa	It sounds like you might have some signs of depression, but I would suggest talking to your Mom to see if you can go to a counselor.

9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	It is totally normal to be apprehensive about something you have never experienced before.  Especially if it involves surgery.  That's ok.<br>  <br>  You will not be aware of anything they are doing.  You will be sedated.  They DO NOT take your eye out.  They will make an incision on the side of the eye to expose where the muscle inserts on the side of the eye.  They will then shorten the length of the muscle and reinsert it onto the eye so as to change how the eye points.  It really won't take very long.  Don't worry.|`|Kp46I3W4aa	WHAT?|`|XkWd08Uvaa	what a bad idea --you may be scared ---but the way you describe is most uncultured and unscientific way ---there is no such a procedure of taking out the eye,added to this, had it been done in younger age the out come would have been good  ----you have not told your age---- to appreciate your intention to have the strabismus surgery
00BZohelaa	Speaking as someone who also suffers from Ulcerative Colitis, this is a flare up.  It sounds like you are very helpful and supportive of him which is great.  I am currently in a flare up and know how difficult it can be.  At my worst I was running to the bathroom twenty times a day.  It takes a toll on your body.  It is a vicious cycle because stress can effect it, but the more you go the more stressed out you can become.  It is normal that he is going through a flare up.  I suggest that he keep a journal of everything he eats and drinks for a month.  By seeing what foods bother him, he can avoid those as much as possible.  Everyone is different.  I know that spicy foods, foods with thick cheese, and chocolate bother me so I try to limit it.  If you have any questions or concerns feel free to e-mail me.  I know how difficult it can be and will give you as much information as I can.  Hopefully his flare will end shortly.  <br>  <br>  Brian|`|Apd3fHJTaa	sounds like a flare up. he should watch his diet and stress levels. sounds like you are supporting him. It's common for people to have flare ups. Sorry his employer isn't as supportive or understanding. Maybe if they had to go through the same thing as your hubby they would. The doctor may want to see him or will call in meds. In the mean time make certain that your husband isn't passing blood. Sometimes the intestinal lining can become irritated. If this happens go see a doctor asap. Hope he feels better. It may take awhile for his body to adjust to meds. Avoid spicy foods and stress. Good luck.

pl96lkzIaa	It usually takes me one or two days to get used to a new glasses prescription.  You will get used to them more quickly if you wear them all the time.  Just put them on and leave them on.

rHqe7oMoaa	sleeping pills are relaxants. So if you took enough of them you would relax so much that you would suffocate to death. <br>  <br>  And no, you'd keep waking up while you were dying, so you'd be aware of suffocating to death and there'd be nothing you could do about it (provided you took enough to actually kill you). <br>  <br>  If you're lucky you'll come away with damage to your organs or brain damage.|`|Whk8blsHaa	Pretty bad way to go, you start vomiting up your stomach lining which comes with a bit of blood then you will start to feel numb as the brain damage sets in and your heart stops.<br>  <br>  Dont do it, seek free counciling!|`|A5VFd9Rkaa	i think you have to b of an certain age to by them ???xx|`|eWEqGHvJaa	Yes you can OD on over the counter sleepers.

EmgiGg17aa	Yes.  Now why you are could be several reasons.  And you can check about some of them.   Are you taking any medications?  If so, talk to the druggist or pharmacist about whether they cause allergies to cat hair.      Some meds do.  Now they may be able to give you an alternative med that won't cause the allergic effect (but get that cleared with your doctor first) or you may have to say "bye-bye *****"<br>     Sometimes it may be the breed of cat(long hair vs. short hair) that causes the problem.<br>        Or the general cleanliness of the animal(it may live under the floorboards of the house whereas maybe a different one gets more TLC with combing and washes.<br>       And maybe the cat diet is lacking in certain nutrients so the dander is really active.   Change the diet and the dander is under control..<br>    Maybe it is your friends room - too dusty, musty.  maybe you are allergic to your friend.(hopefully) Friends are easy to get.

AA10723498	Oh yeah, definitely, it is a reaction to pineapple.  The tingly feeling is from the acid in the pineapple that most of us don't feel when we eat it, but because you seem to be sensitive to it, you feel that tingly feeling.  Sweating is your body's way of trying to rid itself or cleanse itself.  If you continue to try to eat them, your body may rebel and give you some serious problems.  Speak to your Dr. and see what they advise you to do.  Sorry, you must love pineapple, I know I do.  By the way, are you talking about a fresh pineapple or canned?  Curious, because it does make a difference.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Yes sounds like you are, avoid them in future! and avoid any food containing it too.|`|CHCPnvksaa	That's so funny, my daughter and my mom have the exact same allergic reaction. It's only with fresh pineapple though. There's something done during the canning process that removes the enzyme that makes your tongue tingle.

u0udwkZQaa	I'm a guy, and this may shock you, but we don't get anywhere near as upset or offended as women do about not telling the truth, that's why we do it so often ourselves --white lies that is. For us it's not the fact you lied, or the principle you lied, it's what the lie was about. As long as it's not something major like cheating on him it shouldn't be a big obstacle for him to get passed. I would say get the help you can from a professional, and tell your BF you need to go to see a professional because you're worried about yourself and ask your BF if can be there for you at this time. Then when you come out from one of your sessions, you tell him you've been told you have pathological lieing syndrome --that's not the technical name of course, use whichever term your doctor gives you. Once he realises it's not about you being untrustworthy or not taking him seriously, but it's a medical condition you're having a hard time with and are trying to sort out, he should be supportive and accept the situation, not lecture you on how he can't be with a "liar".|`|VIHw7kRkaa	Melissa is right.  The only way I could ever come clean with things is when I wrote them down.  Write a nice long note for him explaining everything and let him know you really do need help.  I am sure he will understand.|`|YG8J5xA5aa	show him this.<br>  If he is as amazing as you say, knowing you have these problems, he wont leave you.|`|pd5LkFWoaa	The truth will set you free, mentally and in sooo many other ways. I would write him a note and in the note please let him know that you are sorry and that if he is willing to give you another chance. You will see to it that you will get help. Good Luck

d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	Try to find the HQ of Gold's Gym or at least the location of a Gold Gym's office in your state. Be aware that the place that closed might be a franchise and not owned fully by hem, so they might not really know much about what happened to you. You can find this info in their website. <br>  <br>  You can threaten with the BBB (Better Business Bureau) and seek some legal advice. A court clerk might be able to help.

mAp90hEeaa	Your body is trying to tell you something.  It is trying to heal and you need to rest.  Glucose will not improve this - you need to eat some protein and continue to rest.  Just because your current symptoms have gone away does not mean that you are completely well.  Continue to rest today, eat nutritious foods and tomorrow should be better.

Y4s4Om38aa	L-dopa is a precursor to Dopamine that is able to cross the blood brain barrier (dopamine is not) and is often given to Parkinson's patients to try to boost the Dopamine levels in the brain.  Parkinson's is when the brain looses a large number of dopamine producing cells.  L-dopa provides the remaining cells with the precursor to Dopamine so hopefully allows them to produce Dopamine at a faster rate then it otherwise could.<br>  <br>  Wellbutrin is a multiple re-uptake inhibitor that blocks the proteins that would bind to Dopamine and Norepinephrin (sp?)(the third neuro transmitter effecting mood) to take them back into the cell that produced them to be broken down.  Since less is taken up and broken down, levels available to receptors is raised.  <br>  Wellbutrin does help a lot with depression (is what I am on for it).  Am pretty sure Wellbutrin is the only antidepressant that effects dopamine, however i could be wrong.  (also goes under the name zyban for smoking cessation)<br>  <br>  Really no medications "activate" the production or release of dopamine.  They work on other means of raising levels.|`|6utUL9Hiaa	I know Wellbutrin is a dopamine drug that works for issues related to depression and/or seasonal affective disorder.  I'm not sure how else to activate the dopamine without medication, though.

Your genetics and natural frame usually, however, are a big determining factor of the kind of physique you can gaain easier. Ex: A really lean person could probably get toned easier then bulky. You could try mixing up your workouts which usually does a good job of stimulating muscle growth and keeping your body guessing.

That style of workout routine builds "mass"/muscle size. And if YOU wanna "tone" your muscles, then you use the same amount of weight, and do more repetitions. Adding weight makes the muscles have to get bigger, to compensate for the added weight. And more repetitions, of the same weight burns fat, and just tones muscles.<br>  <br>     ~Thee Raunchy Mann~

mfwNdPGXaa	A better way to re-hydrate and get your body back into balance might be to drink an electrolyte enhanced drink. Gatorade is awesome for rehydration and is less invasive than an IV. A dose of IV fluids certainly wouldnt hurt you, but this is an easier way. <br>  Even if you aren't dehydrated (which you probably are on some level) your body is not going to bounce right back to prime health after a bout of the flu. you need to take it easy, the more you do too soon, the longer your recovery is going to be. Sleep as much as you can, sip gatorade and you will be good as new soon!   Good luck and feel better!|`|KSUPtqCaaa	No, it really isn't worth it. Oral rehydration is far more valuable, and my young pediatric associate above is quite correct.<br>  <br>  In rehydrating people in a very, very hot place on this planet, I've noted that IV's are not the best means to rehydrate and maintain hydration. While IV therapy does provide short-term resolution and improvement, I have noted several significant rebound dehydration cases after IV-only therapy. I would posit that IV therapy should be about 1/3 the strategy in a rehydration plan, with the remaining 2/3 being oral rehydration (1/3 plain water, 1/3 electrolyte replacement such as Gatorade or Pedialyte).<br>  <br>  I could get technical as to why I believe this is so, but I won't bore you. Just remember to drink more water and get some rest!<br>  <br>  Cheers!

For the vast majority of people who have to have a part of their intestines removed (for whatever reason) there is no actual need to be fed intravenously, you just eat as normal but instead of going to the toilet as normal all the body's waste products are collected in a bag attached to the opening (stoma) on your belly. As for affecting your life well some people have a colostomy as a temporary measure (while the diseased part of the intestine heals) and can be sewn back together again as it where but for others when it's permanent it can often (after the initial shock of the surgery and all that) lead to an overall improvement in there quality of life as they are finally rid of a lot of pain and suffering caused by having a diseased bowel in the first place so although it is a fairly 'big' and life changing operation to go through it doesn't necessarily mean that it's all negative. You could be working all day along side people who have a stoma and you wouldn't know it unless they choose to tell you.|`|q4tTabfjaa	Many folk live without a large part of their intestines.  <br>  Talk to your doctor if this is your fate and the options.

ebQJsYTxaa	Every medical intervention, including vaccines, carries risks.  The sensible thing is to compare the risks and benefits.<br>  <br>  There have been zero cases of polio in the United States since 2000.  Between 1979 and 2000, the only cases of polio in the U.S. were caused by the oral live virus polio vaccine.<br>  <br>  So for a parent to make an informed decision to vaccinate against polio, they must think it is somewhat likely that their child would otherwise be the first person since 1979 to get wild (non-vaccine induced) polio.

Polio is spread primarily by the feces of an infected person getting into the food and/or water chain.<br>  <br>  My wife is a polio survivor from the very early 60s and we do a lot of research into polio and post-polio syndrome. I am also webmaster and editor for our polio group's website, ppbga.org.<br>  <br>  I read a recent article where Kenya has just announced its first polio infection in 20 years! That's right -- Kenya has been polio-free for 20 years until recently.<br>  <br>  Kenyan children have not been recently immunized due to the post-election violence in 2008. Although it is true that last year, polio was only endemic in four countries: Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan; those countries still have the potential to re-infect anywhere in the world, including the US and other western countries.<br>  <br>  Here is one reason: The young parents of today are on rise to reject the injection of polio and some other vaccines to their young with the fear the vaccines will cause an outbreak. The polio vaccine, over time, eradicaetd the disease in the US.  Today, some vaccines are NOT required as they were some 30 years ago before children were allowed to enter the public school system, thus increasing the chances for the diseases to return -- maybe not in the near future, but unless positive changes are made, these viruses will return to haunt us and others in the western hemisphere.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps to answer your question and feel free to visit our website.|`|YCXxP43Laa	No it's not a good reason, and it is one of the safest vaccines, having a proven safety record of decades.

You know it must have hurt extremely bad for me to go to a doctor when I was on vacation.<br>  <br>  Yes, it did hurt to touch it.|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	I'm with Jonathan: I'm a little surprised about your doctor not being able to see you. If those bumps are painful enough to make you cry, take the problem to the hospital or emergency room.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|FAQldsUZaa	Try and calm down... if your doctor wont see you for 2wks w/ your symptoms then I suggest finding a new doctor. There is no way that he/she can not squeeze you in sooner then that. Bumps could be a numerous amount of things.|`|AA11635143	Come on, get your finger off the panic button.  Both are probably ingrown hair and will either form a pimple and pop out on their own or will dry up.|`|crZg76Hpaa	It could be anything. Don't worry. Just go see your doctor.|`|OjIz85U3aa	go to the hospital then<br>  <br>  I find it hard to believe you cant see your doc for 2 weeks tho.|`|cbIb4hmZaa	try not to worry ,even  though it may be hard not to ,just put your faith in god and i will keep you in my prayers god bless .|`|lqt3wTQvaa	well it isn't tumors because tumors don't hurt<br>  <br>  <br>  they could be cysts or a staff infection that would need to be drained...i would go to the ER|`|NFyQWFoGaa	It sounds like nothing, if you can survive two weeks, you'll be fine.

zupacfZTaa	Stay in touch with her and keep the lines of communication going between you and her.  Tell her what you learned whenever you think she will be open to it!  How did YOU break free of that?  Anyone who helped you that might give you advice in dealing with this one? You must have a good story to share with her! <br>  Also what country? Some people of other countries seem anorexic to westerners who tend to eat too much.  Are you really sure?<br>  Don't give up on her!|`|mzFulBFFaa	This can kill her, try showing her evidence that this could kill her, for example offer making her take a blood test to see that she's actually dying.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	give her a cheeseburger|`|KaDuWf0Qaa	You need to call up her parents and say, straight out, "She has an eating disorder.

9pLdhuBnaa	No, there's no injection that treats yeast infection as of yet thta I know of.  However, I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	I am guessing the discharge is from yer vagina.  It could be a number of normal things.  Post coital drip, normal vaginal flushing, sexual excitment...just to name a few.  The vag normally cleanses itself.|`|UxlL89rHaa	Trust me if the oder is strong then it smells BAD, As it was said on Austin Powers, everyone likes there own brand.<br>  <br>  Go to the Doctor as this could be a sign of infection.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Go see a doctor. Could be related to infection, venereal disease, simple yeast infection.  Or simply a normal discharge, however normal discharge has no odor. The best way to find out is seek medical attention from a professional.|`|7XIWtNr6aa	You just asked this question. You probably have a yeast infection. Or, you are about to get your period. Discharge is normal. Most women have discharge everyday.|`|FVeNsugBaa	It might just be part of your cycle. But if it doesn't go away within a week, see a doctor. Don't freak out about it.|`|zRc4Swewaa	Better consult your doctor.|`|JAaLLj5Taa	if you are having so much of fat  in your diet then reduce it.try to have a lot of water,it will help you out.and remember if you love nonveg then stop having eggs,it will certainly help you out|`|DHwuMoWbaa	if you have any deodrants perfume spray it there, it is healthy it helps the blood flow and increases lung capacity<br>  hope this helped<br>  x|`|us8rzUUfaa	Normal

zon13nY2aa	Yes it sounds like a good starting place, as long as you're incorporating a healthy diet too.<br>  <br>  Maybe when you feel comfortable with 30 minutes of aerobics you could increase this to 1 hour and do it every other day, if you don't have time every day.<br>  <br>  Also, try jogging home from work instead of walking?|`|fVmYEazcaa	In one answer no but you have to start of gently at first then build it up.For example i started of gentle but now i go to the gym and workout on the treadmill crosstrainer and rowing machine 5days a week and since i've been doing that i've lost nearly 1 stone in weight but before you do anything like that i would strongly advice you to get checked out by the doctor as with any exercise routine then you know what your limits are good luck|`|AA12198082	If you do this every day that is fantastic. Remember to try and monitor your heart rate and keep it at around 140-150ish .<br>  <br>  Also that weight loss is 80% diet. So really watch what you eat and start thinking healthy foods. A balanced diet is the key. Not a craze diet that tells you not to eat carbs or to only eat proteins. A diet that uses terms like ‘any, always, and never’ are bad.<br>  <br>  Everything in moderation; Select quality healthy foods in the right amounts.<br>  <br>  Anything that promises results without work is snake oil <br>  (aka BS). There are no pills that offer a magic solution and meditation, getting poked with needles, and any other means it not burning calories and therefore a waist of time. <br>  <br>  Ask people who have lost weight and maintained it. See what they say; 'diet and exercise' or 'hypnotherapy, magic beans or needles'.|`|84jaeplzaa	So this answer is just from personal experience. I make sure to drink 640z of water a day (extra while i'm working out). I eat breakfast (oatmeal or toast) anything to get my metabolism going. And i dont eat past 7 (8 tops). That gives you time to let your food digest. I saw results just doing those things...oh did i mention cutting SODA out!!! And i lost 30lbs! Then i finally started getting my *** to the gym once i felt a little more fit and worked out 3 days a week for an hour! But i wasn't getting results because i didn't really know wjhat i was doing. So when a fellow gym mate introduced me to fitness classes (which are free to club memebers) i started to take BODY WORKS, AND STEP! GREAT RESULTS!!!! They are only an hour long and they work out every inch of your body. The great thing is that they have you change things up day by day so your body doesn't get used to one routine and it continues to burn fat! my instructor just informed me that if you drink 1 bottle of water before you exercise you will even burn more calories!|`|vQ9Y2JUWaa	yes it is
k5P8XK62aa	A little tip for you:<br>  <br>  Those horrible black lungs that you always see pictures of really aren't smokers lungs at all.<br>  <br>  Or even human lungs.<br>  <br>  They're usually pigs lungs, that have been dyed to what the seller thinks is an appropriate color. You can buy them here: <a href="http://sargentwelch.com/simulated-smokers-lung-kit/p/IG0040339/" rel="nofollow">http://sargentwelch.com/simulated-smoker...</a><br>  <br>  And they come complete with a palpable simulated tumor just in case the dye job wasn't scary enough.<br>  <br>  The great thing about the pictures is that no-one really questions their authenticity, whereas the truth is that unless you're suffering from a lung disease then your lungs will look pretty much the same whether you smoke or not.|`|s6GKHKccaa	Probably.............PUFF.
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	How rough?  You need to make sure that you are not putting the baby in jeopardy with the sex.|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	Personally, I have not participated in such a thing, nor would I, for the baby could be harmed.  If you have, I'd get with you ob/gyn soon to make certain the baby is OK.  And, for the baby's sake, please be careful until the pregnancy is over.|`|hk5f8yxVaa	Most sex is fine while being pregnant. The only worry thing would be very long, sharp implements in the area, or overly rough body roughness, but to be honest, it has to be VERY rough before you have to start worrying.<br>  <br>  In fact, to the person who commented just before me, sex is good for the health of a child while pregnant!!|`|zupacfZTaa	Sounds like a question for your doctor and whether anyone else did or didn't doesn't matter to you... What matters to you is YOUR baby! <br>  Sure people have in the past and it has been fine... <br>  but how far along are you? <br>  How rough? Like a violent rape type rough? Go see a doctor! <br>  No one here can ease your mind like your doctor can and if there is a problem, that's the only one who is gonna help!|`|wkyNWtfAaa	geez you already had sex and got knocked up. now you wanna have more sex and give the poor babby a concussion? keep yo legs closed lady!|`|5eSSAT69aa	oh, i like it rough.

Ve6RAuq3aa	noo very few cough mixtures do because of the addictive potential of codeine...if u live in  australia cough mixtures containing codeine have to be given the okay by a pharmacist and very few are at the pharmacy i work at.....many cough mixtures contain expectorants or in place of codiene they contain dextromethorphan, a suppresant that isnt addictive and just as good as codiene|`|AA11747527	No.  You can only get codeine by prescription.  Even then they don't necessarily put it in the cough syrup but they usually do when i go to the doctor.  The stuff knocks me out though so i can't take it while i'm at work.  Learned the hard way.|`|YYFCPfaDaa	Not all of them. Some do. And are not prescription only, at least not in Ireland/UK. Codinex is an example. The amount of codeine in each dose is quite low, so prescriptions are not necessary.|`|sGoEj6qsaa	No, none of them do - except some that are prescription only|`|XwXuJIF8aa	no and there are some without alachol. <br>  Used to go out with a lady that was a recovering alacholic so she needed to get a special variety of cough medicine with no alachol in the contents.
3jjOpK0aaa	You could try viagra but I will tell ya what,  that stuff sucks.  The side effects are terrible.  Have you ever tried a sexual enhancer?  I was in your situation,  like  I said,  viagra was tried but it wasn't for me considering the side effects overwhelm the pleasures of it.  I found this natural herbal enhancer and figured what the heck,  if it's natural it must be great and plus it said no side effects.  I tried it and after about two days of taking it I was just horny like a mad man.  All the time,  I have erections that want to stand straight up and the orgasms are to die for.  The stuff was called vigrx plus and I saved on it at the time at <a href="http://hughs-reviews.com," rel="nofollow">http://hughs-reviews.com,</a>   You should check it out.  I love the fact it's made from a researched blend of herbs that seem to do the trick for me atleast.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|6TSwoU3yaa	The biggest cause of sexual inability is stress of one kind or another.  Your stress is shown in nervousness.<br>  You need to learn that sex is an enjoyable occasion between two consenting mature people.  If you are carrying a form of guilt or some other repression (from experience or otherwise), you need to be able to let go of it.  If you need help, seek out a good therapist who will counsel you in ways to deal with the problem.<br>  It is quite understandable that you are depressed and snappy.  Viagra will not help you to overcome these problems, and in fact may lead to more complications than you need.  You need instead to deal with whatever the issues are, then get on with life to the full.|`|ZzcGlrtCaa	You're gay and you just don't know it yet.

hk5f8yxVaa	She's mentally ill to the point where whatever you do, it won't be enough for her. Your life is yours to own.|`|ISjFdI1taa	Oh please live your own life - you only get one of them!<br>  You should be thinking about your future and happiness now. <br>  I have 2 daughters and I didn't have them so that they could support me, I want them to live full and happy lives.<br>  Seriously, she must have a personality disorder if it's an incurable conidtion like this and you shouldn't have to pick up the pieces. <br>  My stepmother had a borderline personality disorder so I know what I'm talking about.  The only resolution for you is to get out of the situation and not visit or have her to stay.  She will be the same whether you're there for her or not. <br>  I feel sorry that your Dad has to put up with her behaviour day to day, but that is his problem, it shouldn't be yours.  It sounds harsh, but it's true.|`|FtVRYkI4aa	ok, so I did not understand if you live in the same house with her or "60 miles away"<br>  <br>  Anyways, I would say that you should just get married and ask your mom to respect your husband. If she decides not to respect him, then I guess you will have to kind of avoid spending too much time with her.|`|6g1MUG5xaa	take all your money and go live somwwhere else|`|MtDEf9zxaa	I actually feel really really bad for your mom.  I can see that she has been a pain in the *** but when you said she had seperation anxiety, my heart almost ripped in two.  Could you imagine what it would feel like as an adult to need to be with someone twenty-four seven?  To have no independence (in her own head)?  I feel really bad for her.  At the same time, I could see how her disease would turn her into a nasty bitter old woman.  I can also see how this would make it difficult on her family.  I don't know the whole story but maybe you and your dad should just forget about it all.  Stop going to see her if she is just going to be evil about it.  I don't understand your dad going there every night (although I have to say he must still love her very much to keep doing that).  As for you particularly, tell your mom you are not coming unless you can bring bf along and she has to be nice to him.  If nothing can come of making threats to her then just stop going.  If your dad gives you crap about it, tell him to stop going to.  I almost feel bad for giving that advice but it seems like you have nowhere else to go.  Her disease seems to have taken control; either that or she is just really really stubborn.  I'm sorry I'm probably not much help.  Good luck in whatever you decide to do.|`|P04f8eUMaa	This is a black and white situation.  Either keep putting up with the situation or leave to parts unknown. You do not owe your parents anything but respect.  You can respectfully leave and never be heard from again. I do not think that you are strong to do that. I would. I would just pack up and leave and forget both of them and not feel any guilt.  They are toxic parents. Poison parental behavior. You cannot change them, but you can change yourself  LEAVE!!!!!!!!! To parts unknown NOW or your life is ruined  So this is black or white Period..If you stay that means you like this lifestyle. LEAVE!!!!!!!!! NOW!!!!!!!!!
zdu3gh8jaa	Firstly let me send you a big hug (((((HUG))))) because it sounds like you need one. <br>  Now to get on with my thoughts. <br>  I do not feel that it would be fair on your partner to have to look after someone who obviously does not like him so no I would not ask him. I also think your dad is being unfair by thinking that this should be done. You and you partner are under more than enough stress at the moment with him losing his job and the amount of care you already offer to your mum, please don't put any further pressure on yourselves at this time. What little free or spare time you have should be spent with the person who has supported you for the last 8 years and it should be spent as enjoyable time if possible. <br>  My late mum used to think that everyone should have been at her beck and call, one little job would turn into 3 or 4 jobs and it didn't ever matter that I had a family of my own to look after if she wanted something, she wanted it. For the last few years before she died (she was 63) I chose to stop running when she called and pay more attention to my own and my families needs. <br>  Is it necessary for you to have her up at yours for the weekend? How does your partner feel about this? Could your dad not have her at his house instead or he go live at her house for a few days? Could you not contact social services and ask for a carer for her, someone to go in and stay with her for a few days? Or what about respite, she could go have a little holiday in a care home or hospital type setting for a week or two to give you a rest? Is there no way you and your partner can get away for a week or two and leave your mobiles switched off for most of the time, again so that you can get a break? It is not easy caring for someone long term - I know that first hand as I have a learning disabled son, it is emotionally and mentally draining and often ends up with the carer  requiring care themselves.<br>  Has she had any recent checks with the doctor? Perhaps if she is on meds, they need to be reviewed or if she is not on meds, then the doctor can give her something to enhance her mood and lessen the anxiety episode that she appears to have.<br>  I am sorry that I am unable to help you further, but I truly hope that you get some necessary help sooner rather than later. Please don't let her push you into doing for her just because she makes you feel guilty if you don't and don't allow her to talk down about you or your partner. If you feel you just want top talk or shout or even sit and cry, I have a cyber shoulder and ear for you. Don't hesitate for one minute if you need to talk to someone, my email addy is in my profile. Here's another big hug(((((HUG))))) for you and a warm smile :-)  Hope they help a little. Good luck to you for the future, I wish it brings an abundance of all the good things and happiness that you deserve.|`|G9NF6P6xaa	its nt fair for u to have to go through this if there is no one to look after her all the time perhaps you should think of putting her in residential care one of the ones where she has her own flat but there is always carers there i know its nt nice but you shouldn't have to bare the heart ache and stress or ur dad or partner its nt fair to any of you and at the end of the day your in a tricky position its your life or waiting hand and foot on ur mum you need for her to have Professional help and if she is in residential care ie sheltered housing with live in carers maybe her condition will improve nd so will ur relationship with her
g7M1DxFCaa	Tweezers if you can get to it without pushing it in further.  Soak it in hot soapy water for a bit, this will help to soften the skin, help you to see it clearly and make it easier to remove.  Failing that then I'm afraid it'll have to be an axe or a chainsaw, sorry.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Put some Vaseline on it. Cover it with a band-aid and wait awhile.  Wash the area good with soap and water.  Soak a sewing needle in alcohol then get with it.  Use some triple antibiotic ointment on the area when finished.|`|fVmYEazcaa	best to have a long soak in the bath and that will soften your skin on your finger then with a sterilised needle gently get it out and when the splinter has come out enough pull the rest out with a pair of tweezers.|`|AhpS6XJnaa	Numb it with ice first, then get a small needle to manipulate the splinter out of the skin, once you can see the tip of it use a tweezers to pull it all the way out.|`|I3CNklLKaa	A local anaesthetic and a skilled surgeon working in a sterile lab would be safest and least painful. However I suggest you make do with a needle like the rest of us have to.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	soak it in water for about 30 minutes then the wood will soften and then it won't be painful eventually you will shed skin and it will come out|`|o3P4Ldfqaa	Soak your finger in hotwater for 2 mins and squeeze your finger and use tweezers to take the thin layer on skin off and remove it.

You need to go to a doctor and get a prescription for an antiviral like Valtrex to speed healing.|`|63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	No, No, please do not try this, you need to go to your doctor and get Gardasil, it's been approved by the FDA. The warts that compound W takes off are different from the Human Papilloma Virus, they will burn the skin on your Penis, and this can cause propbems later in life.|`|Y6YrRo7Uaa	NO NO NO NO NO. You need to talk to your doctor. I dont have genital warts, but I tried to use compound W on a small wart near my eye and it burned. Do not use anything that would burn your eye in your genital area. this could be VERY painful and cause a bladder infection. They have special creams for genital warts. And if it is because you are afraid to talk about it with your doctor, you need to. It is very important to take care of yourself.
PK498w0Saa	Go to somewhere beautiful. A lake, a mountain, a pretty garden or somewhere with a lovely view of the city if you live in a city. Take a guitar/ painting equipment/ something to write on or whatever you do to relax and be quiet and creative. Then you can just sit quietly on your own and look at the lovely view and think. You can play guitar, draw, write, whatever but turn your mobile phone off and just relax there. Don't force anything, and if it doesn't work straight away keep going there.<br>  I hope this has given you an idea.

k699gXX0aa	You never truly lose the weight your body changes when you have a baby your bum gets bigger and so do your hips.<br>  The only way I found to lose the excess weight is to starve myself I don't suggest you do the same as it makes you mentally ill !<br>  there aren't that many skinny mums out there!|`|zon13nY2aa	^ To the answer above, that may be the case for you, but my Mum got her figure back after having me and my sister. I guess it can depend on how much weight is put on during the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to start gradually. Take a walk every day. Then progress into jogging when you feel confident enough. I used to hate jogging but then I invested in some proper running gear and it makes me actually want to go!<br>  <br>  If you don't like the thought of being outside, get an exercise DVD - Davina McCalls are meant to be very good. I have a Ministry of Sound dance DVD and a yoga DVD and I do one every other day, and I alternate between the 2. Yoga is really good for toning up.

You can wipe them off with a dry towel or napkin if you 'd like, but don't get them wet in advance.  Since the pills aren't wet at all that means things won't stick to them as well.  You just have to be prepared, they will taste nasty after you rinse them off, but there should be little worry of bacteria once you do.|`|I370yFWQaa	Just wash the container.

jdV5o8NMaa	The pill works by making your body think its pregnant so it will not release eggs- it can fail but most the time it is from not taking the pill right, follow the directions because each pill is a little different.  Some stop your period completly only because there is no break in the hormones.  Most pills have a placebo week and that is when you get your period, it is lighter mine is only 3 days|`|HPpdcAtAaa	According to planned parenthood (a site I've included below and that you should read thoroughly as it covers every type of birth control), the pill is taken every day to prevent pregnancy:<br>  <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-pill-4228.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-...</a>|`|T2iYetpkaa	it makes your period more regular and in some cases a bit lighter or shorter.<br>  in some cases it helps clear acne..

If you do not ovulate you cannot get pregnant.  That is the main purpose of birth control.  It can however be used to regulate your period, ease up PMS, etc.

lLC7Cf2zaa	LOL sorry that's very funny!  But not so uncommon.  My mom's brother used to sleep walk across a busy highway in the middle of the night.  My mom has sleep apnea and snores horribly that wakes everyone up.  I sleep talk - a lot - even screaming.  I hope you don't have a urinary problem still but if you do, they have surgeries for that and medications, ok?  The best thing I can suggest is make sure you get enough exercise during the day - not too much, just enough to relax you - and get into a regular bedtime routine, same time, same schedule, etc.  Some people might ask you if you're having anxiety or depression problems... I don't think that's always the original cause - although it can make you depressed and tired from lack of sleep.  Stress can make it worse though...  so try to keep your emotions calm in your life.  For safety sake, consider a monitor that wakes up your parents (because it probably won't wake you up) if you get out of your bed or open the door.  They probably sell it online somewhere.  Or maybe you can break the "habit" by learning to wake yourself up just enough to go back to sleep, in a semi-conscious state, when you realize what you're doing.

It is an electrolyte beverage that you give to babies when they have the squirts.  Drink three of them today, and each day while you are sick, but you will stay hydrated and not feel as bad.  You can also get these in lovely popcycle form.  I would also take some flu medicine, and just get some rest today.   Eat Chicken Noodle Soup.
CNlfn5Wraa	Alzheimer's is a very tough disease to deal with and I commend you for taking care of your Dad for 19 years. Don't feel guilty that he is in a nursing home because you are at a point where you have done all that you can by yourself and now he needs long term care. There are Alzheimer's support groups out there that may help you. Any disease is hard to understand and it is a terrible thing to watch a loved one who was once so vibrant drift away into their own little world where they can no longer dress or feed themselves and that they no longer remember familiar faces that are so much a part of their lives. Hang in there and God Bless you and your Dad.|`|WSlxwSlFaa	is this a stage of altimerzers, yes it is.|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	My deepest sympathies, Byron!<br>  <br>  I've not had to tend a parent with Alzheimer's, but I have seen my grandparents with it. And I used to work in a place where there were a lot of people with it, or other forms of dementia. And yes, they do tend to lose their ability to care for themselves. And sometimes their ability to walk, depending on the part of the brain affected.

19pRLtvDaa	honestly, i have strange fantasies about this sort of thing too. you aren't crazy. you just have a strong desire for a man to take charge, and for you yourself, to feel powerless. You want him to take full advantage of you... Nothing wrong with that. ;)|`|wORqCGlyaa	it sounds like you just have a fantasy of someone taking complete control over you. the idea of rape once you go into it may be a turn on for you but the real thing is far from pleasurable. i would recommend meting a possible friend with benefits or getting into a relationship with someone and just let them know your fantasy. some guys might get a little intimidated but just slowly move into the idea. once you and your friend or partner decide to try it be sure to set some ground rules before you proceed. there are plenty of people out there that get pleasure from odd things and their is nothing wrong with that. just be safe, go slow, and don't do anything that makes you uncomfortable|`|kKQ9Jp8haa	It's not necessarily normal. Perhaps you using the term "rape" is a bit much though. Maybe you should just say that you want to be treated roughly by an unlikely, though familiar, sexual partner. People won't give you such a hard time about it, and that way it seems/sounds more like a fetish thing than a weird psychological problem you've got. Wanting to be treated rough is actually a fairly common fetish, so there's nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. =)|`|TkWmcgnMaa	No it isn't normal. But I don't think you want to be raped I belive that you want that thrill, the surge of adrenaline. and that is a normal feeling if you can learn to compermise with it. instead of placing yourself in the way of a rape, ie alone in an alley, ask your boyfriend to pretend or something, s&m isn't my style but some people like it, maybe you would too.|`|NMXejLxPaa	NO! do you even understand the gravity of rape?  It is the most horrible thing to go through.  It is in no way kinky or like someone 'pushing you around'.  It is a serious crime that messes with the victims minds for the rest of their lives.

That being the case, nervousness can distract from the immediate sexual stimulation the man is feeling. If your partner is wearing a condom (and he'd better be if you are young), then the condom may be constricting blood flow by being too small a size.<br>  <br>  The reason is most likely psychological. He may be nervous, have sexual anxiety, fears about not being able to satisfy, or sexual rejection because of distaste for the appearance, act, or environmental factors (the place you are, the smell of the room, etc.) in the place you are having sex. One mistake is to think that your partner is not interested in you. The opposite is more often the case, with them being scared of not pleasing you.|`|ZmikGFTEaa	Sounds pretty serious.. maybe he needs to be more exotic.. just dont get into S** immediately.. need to be more sensuous..|`|3gPLONagaa	maybe he needs more fantasy with you.<br>  <br>  You should be more creative using not only your hands and letting him to ask what is his real problem

QODJNf1oaa	Wow, i'm sorry. It sounds like the people are your school are real bullies, which means that they are probably very very insecure, that they need someone to pick on like that. There really is nothing you can do about the bullies. But you can try to get inshape for yourself so and you can show them how much better you look than them in a few months. I would try joining a gym, or just going for walks anywhere & everywhere. Tell you parents that you want to join a dance class, or something fun. Eat more fruits & vegetables, and overall less intake than usual with more excersize and you will be good to go! Good luck =) You are better than them, just realize it.|`|28TJbbNHaa	It is good that you are getting help for this NOW! I was bullied all the way through primary school and then a couple of those kids followed me to high school and that made my life a living hell. As a result, I ended up with extreme shyness which I still find hard to deal with even at 23. And its so easy for people to tell you to stick up for yourself. But its not as easy as that for you. Contine seeing someone about your depression and I also reccomend some kind of group therapy ( ask your doctor) because it helps to talk to other people about what you're going through. You'll feel that you're not alone anymore. Good luck.|`|hI4m3Pnqaa	How about while your on those crutches do a few situps.

If they look at you like you're weird, then ignore it! Other people won't like to step out of their comfort zones to talk to you - so you may have to make the first step; even asking for some help in class, or commenting on the work a bit can help.<br>  <br>  Join a club. If you take up a sport, then that can help to keep you healthy and get you socialising. Exercise has been shown to have a positive effect on depressive people due to the release of endorphins.<br>  <br>  As for what people say about your parents, that's not on. Don't get angry, that just encourages them. Just make it clear that saying those things makes you feel very hurt, and ask them to look at it from your point of view.<br>  <br>  Remember, sometimes people want to find any excuse to put someone down - the comments may be personal, but they just want the kicks of making someone feel bad.|`|5r7RAgXuaa	Awwwwwww.

He didn't get teased, as far as I know, and I had friends who worked in his school.  They would have told me, even if maybe my son wouldn't have.  Why are your friends "fed up with you?"  Maybe they don't want to hear your troubles all the time.  Just concentrate on being a good friend to them.  <br>  I do not want to add to your burdens by blaming you.  Believe me, I know how difficult it is to be overweight in today's society.  I've battled my weight my whole life, and right now I'm heavier than I've ever been.  But I think you have to just keep being a good person and not worry about people who are so shallow that they would judge you for something like that.  That's hard, I know, but you are a far better person than they are.  You can lose weight, but they'll always be rotten, loser creeps.  Hey, two years ago I went on Jeopardy and won over $44,000!  I'd rather be a fat, smart winner than a stupid, skinny loser.  <br>  See if you can hook up with a good endocrinologist.  After years of supervised diet programs, trying everything, and being bullied by doctors and school administrators, my son and I found a wonderful endocrinologist who was recommended by one of my son's teachers, and he lost 130 lbs. when he was 17 years old!  You can do this, sweetheart, but you must ask for the help and support you need.  If your mom can't cope, find a counselor at school who can help.  <br>  Do NOT give up on yourself.

Ignore those ignorant people, you are a kind, sensitive person and you WILL GET THROUGH THIS.  Lots of people experience bullying, its very sad and very distressing - you must not let it ruin your life.  There ae many, many large people who are very happy with themselves and have lots of friends, they are more confident than you, your confidence will grow as you get older.  You could also try to lose some weight - more exercise, less fatty foods etc.  we are all capable of being overweight, its sometimes a medical condition but mostly its poor diet and lack of exercise.  You can't let these people win, so put a great big smile on your face and laugh more, even if it hurts, sooner or later they will get bored with picking on you and find someone else.  Most of these bullies have been bullied themselves don't forget - its their way of being in control.  Don't be like them, if you are a kind person and a good friend then people will see you for what you are.

In other words, it doesn't make any difference at all.<br>  What does make a difference is your age and physical maturity.  It would seem that you are some two years along the road of maturity, so expect more changes yet.  It can sometimes take up to four years for a penis to reach it's adult size from the time puberty sets in.<br>  Of course there are a lot of guys who may have already reached their maximum size by age 16, but they probably started their puberty at 12 or 13 years.<br>  Don't be embarrassed by your size.  It is what God has given you, be proud of it and take good care of what you have.|`|qzpQdJ44aa	No masturbation doesn't make the penis any bigger.

H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible. Go to any hospital nearest to your home, they will assigned you a doctor.<br>  Anything that inflames the stomach lining can spark gastritis, a sometimes sharp but often dull, gnawing upper abdominal pain that can be accompanied by belching, bloating, and nausea. Heartburn may cause similar symptoms, but that pain typically is a burning sensation in the center of the chest, behind the breastbone. Any abdominal pain is consider an emergency. And good luck.|`|rVsnBLfdaa	I do not know if you are covered for ambulance, if you are, ring an ambulance, it is better to be safe than sorry.

There are plenty of tall people who don't drink milk. You do need calcium for healthy bones but you can get that from other foods.<br>  The two main things that affect your height are your parents heights and how far you are into puberty. At 14 some girls are finished growing but some have hardly started. How long ago did you get your period?<br>  How tall are your parents? Tall parents = tall kids, short parents = short kids.<br>  If your height really is a big issue for you I have loads of advice on how to deal with the problems you have. I also have tips on how to make sure you grow if it's possible, and how to make yourself look taller than you really are. You can contact me through my profile if you want.<br>  Simon<br>  ;-)|`|eWEqGHvJaa	You are smaller because of your genetic make up.  You could still gain a few inches by the time you are sixteen. Your intake of milk has nothing to do with your height.  You should be using a lot of calcium because you don't want to get osteoporosis. There are some advantages to being smaller. You don't have to let out all your pants because they are usually to short and the same with your dresses.  I am 5'8" and have a 32" inseam.  I have to by tall cloths and they are not always easy to find.|`|lZ3INiojaa	is your mom and dad tall? Probably not, hey. Its not milk darling, its genetics. And good news, you will still grow.

Either way, you should not let it get as bad as you have because strep throat can end up killing you (seriously) if it goes untreated. See a doctor immediately!<br>  <br>  The most common symptoms of strep throat are: <br>  A sudden, severe sore throat. <br>  Pain when you swallow. <br>  Fever over 101°F (38.3°C).<br>  Swollen tonsils and lymph nodes.<br>  White or yellow spots on the back of a bright red throat. <br>  You may also have a headache and belly pain. Less common symptoms are a red skin rash, vomiting, not feeling hungry, and body aches. <br>  <br>  Strep throat can be passed from person to person. When a person who has strep throat breathes, coughs, or sneezes, tiny droplets with the strep bacteria go into the air. These droplets can be breathed in by other people. If you come into contact with strep, it will take 2 to 5 days before you start to have symptoms.|`|pNKBszseaa	I would say that you have a very bad case of strep throat or tonsillitis.

It should not be coming off inside you but if it continues to do so you are going to have to go on birth control yourself to safeguard against pregnancy.

Good luck!|`|7e4580c39089e9616fbf69fee3559743aa	Probably you're just lifting your body off him too far for the condom not to be pulled away by your vaginal muscles. There's nothing wrong with that and it probably feels great for him, but as a condom is your chosen method of birth control, obviously you've got to make sure it stays ON :P <br>  <br>  No easy way to say it - I'd recommend just bouncing a little less enthusiastically. When you're on top of him, just rock your hips slowly and try not to lift your body up too far and it should stay on. <br>  <br>  Or go on the pill and then you can do whatever you want!|`|EMbaak9waa	Make sure you are putting the condom on properly. <br>  There are instructions in the condom packs, follow them.<br>  Use a lot of lubrication so your not dry inside which could cause it to come off inside you.|`|qNdsNhgOaa	It really shouldn't come off that easily..Maybe the condoms you're using are too big.

rLSd9Z1Faa	June is about 13-14 weeks away so 40 lbs in 13 weeks is around 3 lbs a week. This is still on the healthy side of losing weight but just make sure not to starve yourself to get there. You need a net loss of 1,500 calories a day. You probably burn around 1,500 calories through everyday living and then you can burn off the calories you eat by exercising a lot.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life.

However, most chocolate sold in the US, and a lot in Canada, is not great quality.  If you look at the ingredients and see "palm kernel oil" instead of "chocolate liquor" you know you have poorer quality chocolate.  This is quite oily, and from my experience (a chocolate lover with oily skin at the best of times), it is the oil that is the problem.  <br>  <br>  Many people think it is sugar that is the problem.  I am not sure about that, but I do know that oily food can make me break out.  Bad chocolate does for sure, while good chocolate doesn't at all.|`|CRHlMPTUaa	No it dose not. I have heard that a lot. When I went to the dermatologist he said that is not what causes them. Your pores get clogged and that is what causes acne.

S5ZYHiFaaa	well, if you mean that you want to actually eat the weed, then i don't think that it'll do much to you.<br>  <br>  what you want to do instead is take about a quarter ounce of weed (i mean the good bud, not shake) and cook that with a pound of butter?<br>  <br>  see, with butter, the fat content absorbs all the thc, so if you cook the weed in butter for about 45 minutes, then strain it, you'll end up with a raw material that you can use to bake anything that requires butter, whether you want to throw it on some popcorn or make brownies or cookies or cupcakes.<br>  <br>  and the benefits definitely leave something to be desired. first, you don't hurt your lungs by smoking it. you don't smell like weed, and you can't get in trouble for possession (if your smart about it).<br>  <br>  but a word of warning, pot brownies (or any other marijuana pastry) can be very potent. and it takes some time to get high from it. the mistake that a lot of people make is that they eat a couple brownies, then after a half hour, they think it didn't work, so they eat more and more, so that when an hour and a half rolls by, they are straight tripping.<br>  <br>  and if you have irregular heart beats, that might set you up for a panic attack, and that's never good. so be patient, be smart but most importantly of all...enjoy it.|`|r1Vg6djRaa	it does Not increase heart problems or cause heart attacks..<br>  but Any weed that you smoke/eat/watever wil make ur heart beat fast at first..like for about 10 or 20 minutes when ur really stoned. but the thing is if you dont get paranoid it relaxes you so i dunno<br>  i would ask a doctor if i were you<br>  keep in mind tho that edibles are a lot stronger than weed that you smoke so i wouldnt start out with that i would expect that to make you trip alot more than if you smoked it.<br>  but if you do decide to try it, i would smoke. when ur heart starts beating fast, dont panic. that will make you trip. just chill out and wait for it to pass it is only temporary. good luck and i hope u decide to ask a doctor(obvious one whos cool with it..haha) about it before u smoke<br>  have fun :)|`|yWUIMiyyaa	it all depends dude, everyone that smokes has a different reaction to it...so the only way to find out is to smoke, remember it's not a upper it relaxes you.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	just you thinking that it will speed your heart ..it will you will work your self up into an anxiety attack,,its not hard to do

U76XYDT8aa	I'm no doctor of course.  But stress, weight, diet, age, and race can all play a factor in hypertension.  If you are overweight and get the weight off, and eliminate the stressors in your life.  Also cut down salt in your diet all these thing can help lower your bp.  Take your bp everyday at the same time and take that record to your doctor and ask him about possibly tapering your bp med so you can eventually be medicine free!<br>  <br>  Jessica, LPN|`|DDswEgtZaa	That would have to be decided by your doctor.  If you have done lifestyle changes and your BP continues to get lower then maybe your DR will try weaning you off the medications to see if you BP will stay.  130/80 is still slightly high so I think you still need to medication. Keep up with your lifestyle changes it will only benefit you.  Good luck.

apJeVkfHaa	Ashely P is correct. The biggest factor in showing abs is losing body fat %. To even begin seeing them you need to be below 10% bf. Also when you perform your ab workout concentrate on contracting your ab muscles while performing a rep. Pretend you are trying to contract your belly button through your back. The reason for this is that the abdominal muscles are like any other muscle. If you work them out and they get bigger than it will look like you have a big stomach, just with muscles. Contract your abs while doing the work outs and it will be flat and tight.|`|BwZJXbSjaa	beer run i guess unless you have a fake i.d.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	you can't, your not 21, drinking is illegal for u.<br>  <br>  busch lite 6-pack sells for only 5.99 these days tho.|`|u17oKANXaa	you may need to lose some  body fat to under 10% of your weight to make it visible, then some abdominal workouts will help to strengthen it|`|WIr74dQaaa	One word crunches<br>  If you want to speed the process up use steroids

Don't ask!<br>  <br>  At least your boyfriend doesn't mind.|`|3mAgM405aa	Anal sex is quite enjoyable and will take some preprep before engaging in it.<br>  <br>  Begin by:<br>  <br>  1. Pre-stretching the sphincter muscle by insertion of a medium sized well-lubricated dildo. Do this for at least a week or more prior to anal sex;<br>  <br>  2. Self-administering an enema consisting of plain warm water [without any laxative] via a hot water bottle to wash out all fecal matter from within the rectum; stop administering when the expelled water appears clear. Do this about 2-3 hours prior to the act;<br>  <br>  3. Asking your bf to shave along the shaft of his organ in order to remove any hair. No hair allows smoother entry of the organ. <br>  <br>  4. Using a lot of lubricant [K-Y] on the male organ;<br>  <br>  5. Engaging in the doggie position, where you are on your hands and knees and he enter from atop;<br>  <br>  6. Using a condom is optional since you are basically very clean inside your rectum and should you engage in oral sex immediately after he climaxes in your anal passageway; use an antiseptic/alcohol wipe on his organ before continuing oral sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	An enema is a device for shooting a medicinal liquid up your butt in order to empty your bowels of s.h.i.t.  <br>  In Britain you can't usually get disposable enemas at the pharmacy, but you can buy them online - in America and some other countries they're available at any drugstore.<br>  Useful for inducing quick and thorough bowel action, but not absolutely necessary - so long as your bowels are functioning properly (and you're making the effort to keep them empty in the hours before a planned anal escapade).<br>  The feeling like you need the toilet after anal sex is probably just because your butthole is wide open for a little while when it's over (it'll contract soon enough!)|`|ySYCvabwaa	don't be embarrassed its actually normal|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	LMFAO........
lDSUQyvIaa	Fever should prompt a trip to the ER if its sustained for more than a day or so. Tylenol should help bring the fever down but it sounds like an infection. Your doctor should have done bloodwork to check for infection and abnormal white cell count as a sustained fever means that your body isnt fighting off the infection and a fever is a body's attempt to "cook" the bacteria. I would strongly recommend you go to your doctor ASAP and ask for bloodwork to be done to check for infection. If the fever is still there then you need to go to the ER. If a fever climbs too high for too long it can cause brain damage. You also need to try eating as it takes a great deal of energy for the body to boost its temperature and not eating means you arent replacing spent calories which will lower your body's ability to fight off infections in general.

n6XwqMELaa	Bad Breath affects everyone at some time or another. It can be a social problem, unpleasant for others and embarrassing for the person that has it.In 9 out of 10 cases the problem originates in the mouth and not the stomach, as many people believe. Even in the cleanest mouth there are both good and bad bacteria. These bacteria live off food debris and dead skin cells.  If these bacteria multiply as a result of feeding off food debris and skin cells, they break-down, creating odour-causing compounds called Volatile Sulphur Compounds (VSC) plus other noxious smelling gases. The VSC are the most important of these gases and it is these sulphurous-smelling gases (VSC) that we know of as bad breath or 'halitosis'.<br>  <br>  Bad breath can also indicate tooth decay or gum disease, such as gingivitis or periodontitis so it is recommended that you discuss any issues with your dentist as soon as you can.|`|2iPBwAptaa	Well from a well known medical journal i have discovered that what you have is known as Biffidus Digestivum. It isnt caused by too much mouthwash but is caused by swallowing spiders in your sleep. The average human swallows four spiders per year, but in the rare case that the spider is not icapacitated by your saliva it will try to defend itself, the result are these sores. The obivous cure to this aliment is to sew your mouth shut, but this would mean living off a drip for the rest of your life, so a better option is to sleep with a very small mousetrap on your pilow in front of your mouth with a fly superglued in place of the cheese.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist.

I lose about 1 kg per week (2.2 lb) without fail.<br>  <br>  You need to eliminate red meat, animal fats, dairy, processed foods and anything containing additives/chemicals. Then replace that with fish/seafood (not fried), some lean chicken, lots of vegetables and fruit (raw is better), wholewheat pasta, bread and rice. Don't drink fizzy drinks, but increase your water intake. If you don't like eating a lot of vegetables you can make freash raw veggie juices (eg carrot, celery, apple is a good tasting one). There is no calorie restriction as such with this diet, it works mainly because it cleanses your liver and digestive tract.

I am assuming very.     When we are born our stomach has very little in the way of enzymes to digest foods.  The most we have is for the digestion of sugar and simple starches like crackers and baby cookies(which is sugar in a more complex form) so they last longer in the gut keeping the baby stomach full.   As he is introduced into this world, some of those additional enzymes come from breast milk(that is why it is so important for breast feeding, besides that the nutrients gotten from breast milk keeps him fed and alive.)      Slowly into his diet you introduce other foods(mushy peas and carrots and bits of meat(chicken) so that the digestive enzymes that is necessary to break down these foods are introduced into his system where they grow and multiply and stay in the gut tract permanently.    Check out the ingrediants on "'baby food" and you will see that they are not pureed steak and uncooked veges.  They are simply starchy products with a bit of rice or vege in addition.    <br>     I know a mother who was a vegetarian that basically starved the kid after birth as he had to eat raw veges(she did not believe in cooking)  She lost the kid to authorities...as he was malnourished.      <br>      Read up on  proper baby food preparation or ask your doctor yesterday already.

Look for eggs, nuts or even just a protein shake. Eat a healthy snack about every 2 hours.<br>  <br>  If you are female, as long as your periods are regular, you don't have to worry about it.

As I got into my twenties, I started to fill out more and am now quite curvy, though still skinny. Eat lots of protein and lift weights 3X per week. Also, try to limit your cardiovascular workouts. If you play hard at sports, then take it easy for the rest of the day. <br>  <br>  You eat a lot because your body burns through calories so fast. A lot of people are probably jealous that you can do this, but I know exactly where you're coming from! It can be frustrating. Be sure to eat 5-6 times per day.

Strange, but true. Look at Michael Jackson. He had the money to buy everything he ever wanted, and did it buy him happiness? No. Instead he sat alone in a room playing computer games by himself, had a monkey as his best friend, and climbed a tree in his Neverland ranch when he wanted to escape from the media. That is a perfect example of loneliness even when you have everything you could ever want. You are the same. You have all you want - job, family, etc., yet you're still lonely. No one or nothing has the abiliy to change that only you.|`|BgVWSApdaa	I get lonely a lot too.  It doesn't have as much to do with being around people as it does about connecting with them.  You need to know you are loved, understood and appreciated.  I know that for me, I can be around people I love but I need validation once in awhile and if I get subtly invalidated over and over, it makes me very lonely.  I also get lonely if I don't remember to connect with God so prayer usually helps to get me out of a funk.  I hope you day gets better!|`|Iw4Ed5Ueaa	Maybe you are just going through a stage in life.

Sounds like you have either a psychological problem OR cardiovascular problems.  You should see a doctor fast.  Do the psychology last.<br>  <br>  Gays often use - so I am told - rings at the base of their penises to reduce circulation, and keep the penis erect, because anal intercourse is far more demanding.  But make sure you are not going to get a heart attack first.
5rJ6nf2oaa	There are different types of intrauterine device but they all sit in the cervix and prevent fertilisation.

hE4CXKX2aa	Okay, I rather tell you not to.  Right now just there three pieces of info.  Age, height and weight.  I am certain that you are right now very healthy and probably very athletic.  You should not need try to lose another seven lbs.  As this could be more unhealthy for you.|`|a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	Step 1: Find out what your basal metabolic rate is. Go to <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off-permanently.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weigh...</a> <br>  Ignore the advertisements there. This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the <br>  longest period of time while exercising. You have two targets a fat burn zone and an cardiovascular zone. The fat burn is usually 60% of your maximum an d is easier to achieve and <br>  maintain and if your goal is weight loss this is where you want to be. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.<br>  <br>  Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance <br>  <br>  what you eat(equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible) . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/se...</a><br>  This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 <br>  ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it won’t matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight. Great ideas for people on the go are: South Beach Cinnamon Raisin Cereal Bar(awesome snack, 150 calories, 10g of protein! 3g fiber you can not do better, also comes in Peanut Butter and Chocolate), Snickers Marathon Multi-Grain Crunch(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle), Snickers Marathon Protein Caramel Nut Rush(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle).<br>  <br>  Step 5: Balance! In what you eat. Make sure that you are eating Protein, Carbs, and Fiber in every meal. A great way to make sure you get the protein and fiber is Kelloggs Protein Water. It has only 30 calories but gives you 5g protein and 5g fiber for 20z. Go to Wal-mart they sell a 10 pack of the powder for ~$5.50. That way when you are eating a high carb food for a snack or meal you can still get the balance. <br>  <br>  Step 6: Smaller but more. Each smaller snacks more often instead of big meals. This really does work and will definitely increase your metabolism. I eat a South Beach Cereal Bar every 2 hours all day then a good dinner. They keep me full and they taste pretty good. Caffeine is your friend. It is a natural appetite suppressant so have that cup of coffee!<br>  <br>  Step 7: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.<br>  <br>  Step 8(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits<br>  around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).<br>  <br>  Step 9: Sleep, Never underestimate the power of a goodnight sleep. Will power can crumble in a second if your going through your day tired. You end up with a diminished sense of self control and tend to “give in” to temptation.<br>  <br>  Step 10: Find a distraction. Read a book, Ride a bike, Play a game. Whatever takes your mind off of food, do it. You will need something that you can turn to in a moment of weakness. Something that will distract you for a half an hour so that your will can reassert itself and help you to make a rational decision.|`|8SRjELNBaa	I'd just eat 500 less calories a day and do 100-200 sit ups every day... 500 less calories a day = 1 lb lost per week... and the sit ups are just to tone your stomach.

There was no pain whatsoever, nor was it ever bothersome to him. His testicle was hard and swollen for about 3, maybe 4 years before I finally was able to convince him to get it looked at. He had a sonogram done that was "supsicious". We were sent to a urologist who ordered to have the testicle removed (if biopsied and left in the sac could cause the cancer to spread). Once the testicle was removed, we got the news that it was cancer. Luckily after ct scans it has not spread throughout his lypmh system, but he starts chemo this week. If you suspect you have TC, please see your doctor. Luckily the dr's say that if you are to have cancer, this is the kind to get.

Mr. Peachy's answer is way off.<br>  <br>  Diabetes has a lot of different symptoms and most folks don't show all of them.  Someone with Diabetes may only show two or three of them.  Likewise, just because you're showing some symptoms doesn't mean you have the disease.  Those symptoms could be an indication of something else or nothing at all.  <br>  <br>  Peeing a lot and not being thirsty sounds like you're simply keeping well hydrated, but being dizzy at times may be a concern, but it may be nothing.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, if you're concerned or experiencing something out of the ordinary, SEE YOUR DOCTOR.  He or she can help you determine if there's anything to be worried about.
BXd4I9mmaa	If your pap smear comes back abnormal - with cells looking a little different it is almost always HPV/Dysplasia .. There isn't a thing they can do about it.

Your mother should be very sympathetic and maybe you can get her to set up a consultation with a plastic surgeon that you two can go to together. They will explain everything to her in detail and ease her mind about the surgery. Best of luck and I hope you can get this issue corrected and be proud of your body.|`|MXRXG62oaa	all breasts are different dont worry bout it!!!<br>  <br>  just tell her you think your boobs look weird and you might want to get then checked out, then talk to the doc about surgery|`|58wUWTUVaa	Just wait a few more months and then get it done. If money is your problem then I guess all you can do is try to explain to your mum how important it is that you get it done. A way to really impress her would be to show how adult you can be about it, do some research on the surgery, I'm sure there must be websites that have people's experiences of getting surgery. Do not *not* lose your temper and shout at her! That never works.|`|53HWom3Baa	there is nothing to worry you have to go to doctor with your mom and have to checkup yourself with doctor in presence of you mother.<br>  After that as per your doctors advice of surgery it has been easy going for you to tell your mother for breast surgery.<br>  <br>  For more about healthcare and beauty care information from ayurveda you can click,<br>  <a href="http://lifecareayurveda.com" rel="nofollow">http://lifecareayurveda.com</a><br>  Dr. Nikul Patel<br>  Ayuvreda consultant<br>  Ahmedabad - India<br>  www.lifecareayurveda.com<br>  info@lifecareayurveda.com|`|mWQfdEHvaa	I went through the same thing as well.

6UBSUzUIaa	You've got a stye! Those things hurt soooo bad! If it is a little bump on your eyelid, that what it is. It can be caused from a number of things from stress, lack of sleep, allergic to eye makeup, and not washing your hands and then touching your eyes. It will usually goes away on its own after about a week. Some people used eye drops, but personally, I let them go away on their own. Best of luck!|`|PhS1xUw2aa	It might be a strand of your hair, and that can be a nusiance. If it is a strand of hair, it may take time to get it out.

Also, the vaseline will not hurt your eye at all, even if it does get into your eys. Try it!|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Take some water, and lean your eyes into the water, and blink for a few minutes.

Wear a tank top under you shirt and you should be fine and loose pants to pull up.   When I went they just looked at my back, legs and arms.  If they are unsure of what it is they may scrap a small part to send to a lab to be sure but it doesn't hurt.  Some dermatologist like to look for moles and take pics of ones to compare in the future for changes that may be the only reason to remove your clothes but if your uncomfortable just say no.|`|P8qwYZDraa	why would you have to remove your clothing??? or is that only if you have acne on that area for example...like your back or something cuz i am going to one  this week so that kinda freaks me out now!!!!!!|`|CRHlMPTUaa	What are you having looked at. You don't take off your clothes if he is looking at your face, arms, legs or back.

Rk46lIBwaa	Tongue piercing in good hands is in fact a very safe procedure. The epilepsy issue is just bunk! It is possible to go though a blood vessel and the tongue is very vascular, but simple locally applied pressure stops the bleeding.<br>  <br>  The advantage that tongue piercing has over sy belly button piercings which are forever getting infected, is that saliva tends to kill bacteria and tongues seldom get infected.|`|I1tnVvVGaa	i have mine done....i was told that the veins and stuff move as the needle goes through....it's hard to explain, but the way he said it, it made sense|`|cILIQBG3aa	That's only a few people, it doesn't happen to everyone. What you want to do is find yourself a really good piercer who's qualified, maybe ask questions in case concerned. The most that happens is that it will swell for a few days as they give you a large bar to start with, after 2 weeks get it changed to the small one.<br>  <br>  Yes, there is the chance of going through the vein but professionals do techniques in which they remove the vein before putting through the needle. What you need to make sure is that they pierce from underneath the tongue as they can see the separation of the veins to make space to pierce through. In placed like America some piercers do it from the top down which is considered very dangerous. Just be careful who you go with. Good Luck!|`|zBhwEbUkaa	Those people are just trying to scare you. It may be possible for that to happen if you get a person who has no idea what they are doing. The vein in the tongue is not that major and wouldn't bleed out if punctured by a small gage bar. If the piercing is made out of lead or some other toxic metal, you may get epilepsy, but I highly doubt it.<br>  <br>  I've had my tongue pierced for over a year now and the only problem I had was that the guy nicked the major nerve running through my tongue. I couldn't feel the tip of my tongue for a week or so. From what I hear though, that is not uncommon. That nerve is right along where they peirce and is hit quite often.<br>  <br>  Don't let those people scare you and make sure that you go to an experienced and licensed piercer.|`|E53fC992aa	make sure you go to a reputable store to have this done i don't know were your from but most of are tattoo parlours do it in Britain and i have never heard of anyone either getting epilepsy or bleeding to death but it does ruin your teeth it knocks all the enamel off them and that can be quite expensive to fix so just make sure its what you really wont|`|QWuHUBPPaa	Yes it is. Thats why you need to go to a professional!!!|`|f1lpdiNEaa	The tongue is a muscle which aids with speech and eating and has a large blood supply, so if anything goes wrong there are more serious implications. I think it has been said that epileptics should avoid piercings but I think it's a myth.<br>  <br>  However, some dangers of tongue piercings are: chips and fractures to your teeth and gum damage from the metal stud. The body might reject the piercing, leaving you with swelling, scars or nerve damage. The mouth is warm and moist which is an ideal environment for bacteria meaning you must keep it very clean. An infection could easily pass into your blood stream leaving you with blood poisoning or abcesses. There is a risk of hepatitis and other infections with any piercing so make sure things are done properly with an autoclave steriliser and gloves.<br>  <br>  I think the cons definately outweigh the pros (if there are any pros!)|`|sOO93u5Oaa	I've heard the 'bleeding to death' myth, as well. I don't believe it is true, as your tongue is very vascular. Piercers know what they are doing, they would not hit a vein. Epilepsy? Of course not. The main complications you could get is the ring could damage your teeth, and if it did become infected, that probably wouldn't be good, as it is in your mouth and the infection could spread. However, since it is in your mouth, chances of infection are less, because of the enzymes in your mouth that kill bacteria. Just be sure to keep it clean and make sure you wear plastic balls on the ring so they don't do damage to your teeth, gums, etc.|`|Utc7gMzUaa	Well it is true that if the piercer goes through the vein that could bleed to death but if you go to a professional that's not gonna happen because they do that for a living. I've had my tonguee pierced for 3 yrs. Its great. at first its gonna be swollen for like maybe up to a week but if you eat ice it brings the swelling down quickly. Its really fun to have it pierced.|`|iIRO2Lchaa	it is true that if they pierce the artery in your tongue you will bleed out, but according to mates of mine who are piercers you'd have to nearly purposefully do it for that to happen. so the risk is low. i got mine done 5years ago, its unreal like. doesn't hurt getting it done, really hurts about 2days later, but then your free to enjoy it forever. you'll get a good 2years of playing with it before the novelty dies. i'll never take mine out.|`|9wtpCNb6aa	Im not sure about bleeding to death, however a main complication is that it may go through a main nerve and paralyse you.  But i know loads of people who have had it done with no probs<br>  <br>  They just have to eat soup for a few days afterwards!|`|AA12027070	they are true.    very much so..  if they miss and put it in the wrong spot  thats it.    you could possibly have a heart attack.     if your gonna get it done..  find someone with the most experience  for example    20 odd years or so forth  noone who is new to it|`|12R3mikmaa	i wouldnt listen to the stuff about epilepsy you will be ok a wouldnt listen to anything people say. ave had mine done for 5years.|`|CDFmtwLIaa	i'm sure if what these people are saying is true but i wouldn't due to other complications like sex life and stuff... it has it's complications.
mAp90hEeaa	Symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot) is often sudden onset of chest pain accompanied by the feeling that you can't breathe properly.  That said, they have to tell you all of the risks involved in this procedure but the number of people who have this complication is minute.  And, if diagnosed immediately, even many of these clots can be treated medically with drugs. You are worrying needlessly about such a tiny possibility versus the benefit's you will probably get from the port being inserted -  trying to find a vein, the pain of all the punctures for meds, blood draws, etc.  You need to concentrate on the benefits of this access device rather than the minute chance you could have a problem.

6UBSUzUIaa	No they can not fire you for being sick, but most places do require a doctors note. If they do fire you, call OSHA, labor board, and the corporate office to your job and explain the situation to them. If they won't fix it, let them fire you. Draw unemployment or sue them for wrongful termination. Also, it's very illegal for any place to make you come to work and cook being sick. Most states have several laws in place so that you do not have to come to work sick. In Arkansas, ( where I live) you can't come to work with a fever, vomiting, or diarreha if you work in a food establishment. Best of luck; let me know how things turn out!<br>  <br>  Also, I work at Pizza Hut, which is owned by the same company as Taco Bell. Yum Foods. They have the same guidelines for sick time. Go to www.yumfoods.com and read their policy if want!|`|3tuwWidiaa	While there are some restriction on firing someone for being sick, it is perfectly legal... and standard... to demand documentation.<br>  <br>  The fact that you cannot afford a doctor is very unfortunate, but not your employer's problem.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to be fired, then you will need to get a doctor's note.  If you really can't afford a doctor, and there are no clinics in your area, then go to the hospital.  It sounds like you are indigent, and the hospital cannot turn you away.  Particularly when all you really need is verification of your illness.  Over time, you can pay off the hospital bill.<br>  <br>  I agree that it's wrong to make you work when this sick.  But documentation is important.  The cost of a doctor's visit, which is going to be closer to $100 than "several hundreds" is well worth it if it means the difference between keeping and losing a job.<br>  <br>  If you get fired for non-documentation of an illness, you have little recourse.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	You are required by law to tell them anytime you have any of those symptoms, and they are required to let you off. Its that simple. <br>  You can call the state and they will send an inspector and really ream them for messing with you.|`|5Y9Ekm0naa	Is this a large chain type restaurant or a small "ma pa" type place? Because if it's a small place then they are more likely to fire you for whatever reason they want (even if it's not legal for them to do it). If it's a large chain, they can not fire you for calling in one time... regardless of the reason. Now the one thing that might not work out in your favor is that you told them you were sick. When you say you are sick, then you are required to provide documentation. And if you don't provide documentation, it is considered lying to your employer (saying your sick when your not). And you can definitely be terminated for lying to your employer. If you would have just called in and not given a reason at all, then you would be safe. Because they can't fire you for calling in once and they wouldn't be able to hold the "lying to your employer" thing against you. <br>  <br>  Weird how it works out that way... but it's true.

The mind can be its; own worst enemy at times, but know that you can, and will, prevail and outlast your thoughts. The important thing to remember is that your thoughts are only thoughts. If you try to stop them by suppressing them, you are only giving them more power than they should have. It may be more helpful to acknowledge your thoughts as you have them and let them pass without clinging to them. Try not to be judgmental of yourself for having them. see your thoughts as passing clouds, say hello to them, breathe deep and let them go. It may take some practice. <br>  <br>  I would recommend a trip to your local bookstore or library to find books on mindfulness. Authors such as John Kabat-Zinn, or Pema Chodron. Hope that this is helpful.|`|djUMvICoaa	I used to have some really weird ones but after I met others who had some of the same types of thoughts I no longer felt like I was so special in them and they have stopped.|`|UWzAiu8Iaa	I have OCD severely, get a rubber band & put it around your wrist whenever you have these thoughts snap the band. Also tell yourself "It's not me, it's my OCD" You need to be able to realize that these are not your actual thoughts but a product of your disorder. Are you on any medicine? If not you need to go to the doctor & tell him what's going on so they can get you on something & it will help you a good amount. He may also refer you to a therapist who specializes in OCD.

I'd say about 78% of the girls who do this before age 18 really does wish they could take it back. They don't know what the big deal is about it because they didn't wait until they were ready emotionally to do it. Virginity was meant as a gift to be given to your husband on your wedding night. yeah, i know old fashioned, but it still has the consequences. If you wait and give it to a person you feel you could be with for the rest of your life, and he loves and respects you enough to wait as long as it takes,( instead of pushing you into doing something you are not ready for)then you will have a happy experience there. If you feel let down in any way by what you've done it wasn't the right person and most guys at this age want only one things. you. So don't go around wanting to give it away so badly.

YeBbtDW3aa	First off: Is there any reason you have set that specific weight? You should first examine your body- structure and examine what weight is appropriate for your frame. "Scale watching" is a dangerous game to play, as it can sabotage your efforts if you mentally feel you aren't where you should be. When I do my cardio(after I lift) I usually run at least a mile and a half to two miles. I don't watch the time. You your cardio at the right time also, when you wake up in the morning before you eat is THE BEST TIME! You should be consuming at least one gram of protein per pound of body weight also. It doesn't sound like you lift very much, I am going to guess that you feel you will become "bulky"if you lift on a daily basis? Or you just don't have time to? Weight training COUPLED with cardio is the DEFINITIVE way to lose that excess body fat and re-sculpt your body. Any other help I can provide just let me know. Hope this helps you some.|`|yXr3O7uDaa	Hey, try the Master Cleanse Diet!<br>  <br>  <br>  My mom followed the diet for 8-days and she lost 17 lbs!<br>  <br>  Even celebrities did it:<br>  The singer/actress Beyonce did it for 14 days and she lost 20-22 lbs!

Your normally use them for about 30 min, 2x/day, and like the other person said, you're probably best getting the strongest ones you can find.<br>  <br>  You do get what you pay for however.  If you get them done at the dental office, you will get better results, but it is more expensive.  <br>  <br>  If your teeth are not too yellow however, the whitestrips should work fine.  If you have deeper stains or need a lot of whitening, the results may not be to your satisfaction.  Just letting you know to keep your expectations reasonable.
1rcnc56Waa	Personally I never heard about such a thing.<br>  <br>  But I do know a few years back, japanesse did a study on the type of underwear and penile development. Its seems the men who wore Tight underwear (speedo's, tighty whities) had a much reduced penis size then compared to those who wore boxers.<br>  <br>  So probably same concept may apply, compressed space for a prolonged period of time, could limit development.<br>  <br>  But penis size is more genetic, if you want an approximate estimate of your possible maximum capacity, ask your dad, though I doubt you would.|`|39KUKALFaa	Yes it can.  Over 80% of sex change operations are performed on men who sleep that way.  <br>  <br>  There is hope though.<br>  <br>  The trouble is that there are great ways to make it bigger available in Asia but the FDA will not certify the prosthetic devices.<br>  <br>  In Laos, I have seen Japanese made 100V single phase coils that are wrapped around the shaft of the penis and are then lubricated with Panda dung and ground rhinoceros horn. The coil creates a magnetic field facilitating the absorption of the Panda dung and ground rhinoceros horn into the tissues of the penis.<br>  <br>  While the smell is bad for some time, the penis grows and stays grown with monthly applications up to twice its erect length and up to 3 times its girth. This technology was developed from the discovery of the effects of natural ferro magnetic fields in iron ore deposits struck by lightning on Panda penis size by a royal Prince in what is now Vientiane in the 16th Century. The rhinoceros horn is a concession to Chinese natural and herbal medicine.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you can get tattoos and piercings that make it look bigger.|`|EMbaak9waa	No it doesn't stunt your growth and if it did then i'm sure the world would know about it.|`|Eku8XD2Gaa	its a myth<br>  jus read on the following links they will unfold all ur answers about sex, penis, masturbation etc and will sex educate u<br>  <a href="http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/25-Myths-and-Facts-About-Sex.477823" rel="nofollow">http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/25-My...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.healthmad.com/Men's-Health/Common-Sex-Queries.510033" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthmad.com/Men's-Health/Co...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/Adult-Games-Foreplay.538737" rel="nofollow">http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/Adult...</a>
6NZeItMAaa	Your are in a situation that is the major cause of stress and anxiety.<br>  <br>  The first thing that you need to do is to find out the cause of your stress. Once you have found the cause of your stress, you need to address this fact. The cause may be something that you can eliminate, or it can be something with which you have to live.<br>  <br>  In many cases, stress is the result of something happening with your job. In such a case, you have to ask yourself if the job is worth your health and the health of your entire family. Remember, when you suffer from stress, it often causes others to suffer from the same stress. If you are employed at a place where you are actually stressed out all the time, is it really worth it to continue in this employ? What sort of quality of life do you have if you hate what you have to do every single day?<br>  <br>  Quality of life has significant value, or at least it should. There comes a point in everyone’s life when they have to decide what is truly important. Remember that no one ever, on their death bed, lamented that they didn’t work hard enough. Many of us end up not seeing the truly important aspects of life until it is too late.<br>  <br>  If you can eliminate the stressor, be it a personal relationship, a job, or even a certain situation, you will be all the happier for it in the long run. If a job or a person is really giving you that much stress, to the point that you have to seek professional health - is it or they really worth it?<br>  <br>  Are you involved in a toxic relationship that is causing you stress? Get out of it now. Hate your job to the point where you dread going into work on Monday morning? Find another job that you won’t hate. Even if you have to take a pay cut, it is well worth it to enjoy quality of life.<br>  <br>  If the cause of your stress is something over which you have no control, you need to evaluate the problem, face it and seek help. There are many different counseling methods that incorporate behavior techniques to address stress. Medication can be useful in some situations, but tranquilizes should never be a long term “cure” for stress.<br>  <br>  Natural cures for stress include behavior management techniques, proper diet and exercise, herbal remedies and yoga techniques. These will actually work towards alleviating your stress.|`|AA11760237	I feel for you. I have had anxiety attacks and depression that have made me physically sick also. i don't know if you are a religious person or not, but prayer was what helped me. I was to the point that as soon as I set foot out of bed in the morning I had to go straight to the bathroom to throw up. Unless you have been in this situation no one can understand. If you have a Pastor, a good starting place would be to talk to him......If you are not religious, I would suggest contacting you doctor and let him know you are having these feeling and symptoms, he will probably refer you to a therapist of some type. I hope you get some help. Having no joy in life is a very miserable feeling.Just remember, you aren't alone, and you do matter.
c5y2stfCaa	Personally, I think they suck!  I bought a box last month and I had more "accidents" than ever.  They are over priced and not what they should be.  I wouldn't bother if I were you!

sTdlAMv7aa	Lots of things other than testosterone's cousin dihydrotestosterone (DHT) can contribute to hair loss.  It might be worth checking these out before going on something like Minoxidil/Rogaine (which doesn't block the production of DHT & consequently doesn't work as effectively as Propecia/Finasteride [which does block DHT production]).  Blocking DHT can cause serious sexual side effects like erectile dysfunction, so it's not the best route for preventing hair loss.<br>  <br>  Unless you have immense stress or you're recovering from some traumatic experience, this probably isn't adrenally related.  Low thyroid hormones (hypothyroid) may contribute to hair loss.  Ask your doc about checking your thyroid hormones (especially T3 & T4, & even better if you can get free T3 & free T4 tested) via blood tests.<br>  <br>  The other respondent made a good suggestion about products applied to the scalp topically.  This can help without causing as many side effects.|`|a66nvk0taa	Yes is genetic hair loss. Just because your brother has hair and your losing your. Your brother could take his genes from your mother or dad depending on which side of the familyy is bald. The gene for baldness is inherited from the mother, so look at your maternal grandfather and the uncles on your mother's side.|`|ljVwo5qZaa	You want to do something about it right away. Go and see the Dr. and get a topical solution. I'm in the same boat as you but I'm 23 now and noticed my hairline was far back when I was 17. I didn't start to do anything about it until I was 21 and I wish I would have started sooner.|`|39KUKALFaa	Not good - you can shave your head and get it tattooed.<br>  <br>  Minoxidil may work - but it is pricey.
d3VV4b6vaa	cutting out wheat and dairy does help, but I find that eating organic yogourt everyday is a life saver.  nettle tea,and lemon tea also work greatly. you should also buy a himalayan salt lamp.

I also use nasal spray at night called Beclate. Really works!|`|zuQSwIb0aa	VICKS|`|ufgv7oTjaa	The best way I've found is actually so simple it seems weird.<br>  There is something called a Neti Pot that you can get in most drug stores or health food stores... it kind of looks like a small watering pot for plants. What you do is put a Saline solution (a 1% salt water solution... it's easy to make) in it, tip your head sideways over the sink, and pour the solution into one nostril so it can pour out the other.<br>  It takes a few tries to get used to, but if you use it once a day, the salt water helps to clean and nourish your sinus cavities and actually helps to keep sinus problems away if it's used daily.<br>  Like I said, it seems weird and threw me off when I first heard about it, but my mom and step dad use one with great benefits, my mom has MUCH less problems with her allergies now that she uses it, and they've even gotten some of their friends to use a Neti Pot with the same results. Good luck and I hope I helped!
2GdZSXC1aa	First of all relax, and don't stress about it too much. A healthy diet is a good beginning. Do not smoke, smoking has been scientifically proven to lower the ability to conceive.

A natural apple cider can work also, sometimes too well, don't over do it and give them a few days to start working.|`|GxV4jGKMaa	Constipation is common in people that are quitting cigarettes or caffeine.  You're doing both, so I'm sure it's pretty major!  I know it doesn't help a lot to hear it, but time will take care of this!  Don't start taking laxatives because you'll become dependent on them.  Stool softeners and plenty of water help.  You said your eating options are limited because of your teeth, but you can buy powdered fiber that you can add to your food or drinks that will help.  Good luck to you - congratulations!|`|HlD9dRF2aa	You need to drink more fluids, specifically apple juice or something with soluble fiber (Metamucil).  There's a reason prune juice is popular with some.  Your constipation may be a result of your smoking cessation as this is a common symptom.<br>  <br>  Lots of fruits and vegetables (puree) and start exercising -- walking or jogging can shake stuff up a bit.  Yoga classes or swimming can help as well.|`|AA11348118	Part of your problem might have been the pain killers.  They can make you constipated.  Give it some time.  Drink plenty of fluids and try some apple juice.  If the symptoms persist, you might want to talk to your doctor.  Prolonged constipation is not normal.  I do think it was just the pain killers though and you should see your system going back to normal.
dpgXzMenaa	For some girls, it hurts a lot... for others, only a little... for still others, it doesn't hurt at all. Same with bleeding... and there's no way to really know which it's going to be for you until it happens.<br>  <br>  You're ready for sex as soon as you want to do it *and* are comfortable and happy with the following... and if you're not comfortable with *all* of it, you're probably not ready, no matter what age you are:<br>  <br>  First... really be *sure* you wanna "do it" with the guy you've chosen.<br>  <br>  You're a virgin, and your first full-on sex should be with someone you're really gonna want to *be* that intimate with for a while, and I don't just mean the physical intimacy of openly sharing your bodies and their reactions without shame... because there's a lot of mental and emotional stuff that comes with the hormones and hangups that fill the sexual territory between partners. You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, but there's more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  If it should happen that your first time *will* be painful, bracing yourself against pain will only make it worse. RELAX... as he enters you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to pee - this will relax your pelvic muscles and *greatly* diminish any discomfort or pain.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13. No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	It doesn't hurt-just be sure its what you want to do. A big gift that should be only given to someone you really love and respect and that loves you.|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	When i broke mine, i was actually saying ow.<br>  Then it still hurt the second time though i was quiet trying to hide it.<br>  <br>  It does hurt, but it's a nice pain kind of.|`|6UBSUzUIaa	It depends on the girl. Most girls lose their hymen when they have sex for the first time. You don't really feel alot of pain, but you bleed from it. I bled a small amount but I do know people that have bleed substantially. So, no you won't cry and yes you will notice! It's a small band right inside your vagina on your lower (bottom) wall. If you need to know more, I would ask your gyno to show you where it is located and what you can fully expect to feel. Some girls with thicker hymens can have a more painful experience then girls with thinner ones. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|MXRXG62oaa	well i had a really tough hymen and it hurt terribly, and i bled a lot... but honestly for most girls its just a little sore and some blood....<br>  <br>  if you use your fingers first, you can stretch it so that way it wont hurt...|`|A2G9foewaa	From what I have been told it hurts like hell, and the usual reaction is some kind of painful moan so it will probably hurt.|`|AA11593134	you want to break it yourself or from having sex?

1CqTmAVXaa	You can not whiten your teeth when you have braces. You could do is use whitening toothpaste. That's about it. The braces will not allow any type of strip or whitening treatment to work properly (All whitening treatments specifically state to not be used with braces). Just hang in there and wait till they get taken off. In the meantime brush your teeth everytime you eat anything, floss and mouthwash to prevent yellowing of your teeth.|`|48e80d4dffb6b005f6946b03af059d5eaa	you cannot whiten your teeth with braces. All you can do is brush, floss and use mouthwash regularly. Visit your dentist and orthodontist regularly also.|`|KGRikkJeaa	you cant, you'll get little circles because the cement they use to attach the bracket will not allow anything to penetrate. The best thing you can go is use the flouride bottles they give you, or ask for them. They'll show you how to brush. What it does, is it'll keep your teeth from getting stained so that way your tooth isnt dark, but bright where the bracket is/was.|`|eRDwzcaOaa	It is possible to whiten teeth while braces are on actually.  Ultradent's Opalescence does not need to be placed directly on the surface of a tooth for it to whiten, meaning that even if it is placed around the braces, it will still whiten the areas underneath the braces (this has been illustrated in studies w/ dyes, etc).  This is only available through your dentist however.<br>  <br>  That being said, it in general is better to wait until after you braces are off, since you may want them whitened again again if your teeth get darker while you have the braces on; and when you have braces it's difficult to tell how white (or not white) a person's teeth really are.|`|qImMwhUHaa	It's not a good idea to try to whiten your teeth while you have braces b/c you would whiten only the areas that are exposed leaving behind dark spots where your brackets were glued.  You would look really funny when you got your braces off if you were successful in whitening your teeth.  I would say to just wait until you get your braces off and until then practice very good dental hygiene.|`|EQKaMfPAaa	try whitening mouthwash/rinse. It is probably your best bet while the braces are on.

5rJ6nf2oaa	Try not to worry too much, but I know what it's like when you don't know what to expect. I had the same thing done a couple of years ago. They will use a local to numb the area a little. This is a tiny injection in the skin, no gas etc, and very simple. Then they will insert a very fine needle into the cyst to draw out the fluid. This is not painful, you can feel it slightly but it's easy to stand. Don't worry, you won't need to scream or grit your teeth. There was no pain afterwards either. Hope this makes you feel less anxious. Best wishes.|`|g6pqGjrkaa	The Doctors wil remove the Lump after giving Local anesthesia, of course after removal the pain will be their for few days after surgery by it will be covered with the surgeon who prescribes oral or inject ables with  Antibiotics If it is cancer lump radiation therapy may be advices ed .

qrGLcTh4aa	No, you need to get your teeth professionally cleaned by a dental hygienist. After that you can use teeth whitener. Teeth whitener works best on recently cleaned teeth because all that plaque and tarter(which you can't even see) will be cleaned off and your natural enamel will be exposed and ready for bleaching(or whitening).|`|5I7Ifrmraa	Crest white strips.

Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|o93Agstdaa	Yes she can still grow. Also tell her she should be happy with her height. I am 26 and I am 5'1'. my roommate who is the same age and is shorter then me.

w482zTFlaa	It's POSSIBLE... VERY not SAFE. Not eating is unhealthy and a very unwise choice. As a matter a fact, you SHOULD eat and drink water so you can be able to exercise as well. Not eating and drinking low isn't gonna help you lose weight much, it'll mostly damage your body. Your body has to get it's energy, help restore cells, help your immune system, ect... By getting the substance it needs. Food and water. If you do start working out, you probably will lose 5 KG anyhow pretty fast due to the fact that when you start working out, you lose that water (Which you need in extras because of that) which most the weight is coming from. It's actually recommended that if you do start working out you drink more water|`|jaOEtAHKaa	Dont do that.... You could ruin your health !!!! Weight loss needs to be more systematic|`|331512b4169f8467fd51d17e965e5784aa	Keep your weight loss objectives real. If you are asking whether it's safe, you probably already know it isn't. The best way to lose weight is gradual because otherwise you not only ruin your health but also if it did really work and you lost weight radically you would put it on equally easily because your lifestyle isn't going to change so radically. <br>  <br>  Eat moderately, exercise regularly, laugh a lot and sleep well those are the only secrets to maintaining a healthy body.|`|yXr3O7uDaa	Hey, try the Master Cleanse Diet!<br>  <br>  <br>  My mom followed the diet for 8-days and she lost 17 lbs!<br>  <br>  Even celebrities did it:<br>  The singer/actress Beyonce did it for 14 days and she lost 20-22 lbs!

She announced it during the Oprah show.<br>  <br>  Other celebrities include rapper Trina who did this liquid diet for 13 days and Howard Stern's cohost Robin Quivers claims to have lost 73 lb using the Master Cleanse.

HWlN2TqCaa	Weight that you gain while on the pill can be water weight from bloating, and this usually doesn't last. Another reason why people put on weight while on the pill is because it is known to increase your appetite.
7MhqxUNyaa	As a nurse and a wife I can tell you this:  You are not allowed to access information concerning your husband's health or his health records unless he has signed a consent form allowing you to have the information. Or you can access it by having power of attorney over him.  Even though you are married to him he is still an individual and the way the law sees it is if he wants you to know he will tell you.   Now a bit of advice as a wife,  do as I do,  got with him to the appointments and that way you are sitting right there when he sees the doctor.  My husband appreciates me going due to the fact I am a nurse and of course I can tell him in dummy terms what they are telling him.  He won't go without me.  Which sometimes is a pain in the butt. Hope this helps.  I would talk to your husband and tell him you would like to have a medical power of attorney on him and vice versa in case either of you would be incapacitated.  A lot of people have these so someone is there in case of emergency.
Kl0i5wRaaa	Elliptical|`|HlD9dRF2aa	First of all it depends on what you are trying to accomplish.  Second of all how much dedication do you have to the activity/machine.  Perhaps an elliptical trainer but any machine gets dull after a while.<br>  <br>  Swimming overall helps cardio, aerobic metabolism, muscle tone and endurance (sprints actually build muscle).  You are less likely to injure yourself in a lap pool than running.  Also swimming "easy" helps active recovery for other activities such as weight lifting and running.<br>  <br>  Might I suggest the books "Workouts in a Binder -- for swim coaches and Triathletes" and or "Total Immersion-- by Terry Laughlin".  Once you break that 400M barrier, you're addicted.<br>  <br>  The more varied your workouts, the more likely you are to continue and you burn more calories when you cross train.|`|t81MEJ82aa	I'll second the person that said a rowing machine. You have to work your whole body to use it, but most of the workout comes with your lower body. It can help with your core strength especially your back and abs. Elliptical machines do not really give you a full body workout. The arm motion is powered by the legs, and you do not have to include your arms.|`|F5cO0PbLaa	Rowing machines are Fantastic.<br>  <br>  They give you an awesome, high intensity cardio workout. They also will be working your legs, back, biceps, abs, butt... so most of the major muscle groups!<br>  <br>  Ellipticals only really work your legs... the arms only play a minor role.<br>  <br>  Swimming is also great, but you want a machine... so go for the Rowing Machines!|`|XaE4zDRVaa	You don't need a machine, just go swimming.
2Ltc1dAwaa	It will go away, it takes some time, depending on your overall health condition, your blood pressure etc. <br>  What happens is there is a damage in the capillaries and the blood cannot access the area to give it oxygen.  So as the capillaries heal, the bruise will be less noticeable.  <br>  <br>  I say that if you are in overall good health, it should take no more than a week to heal. The area might still be sensitive, but, each day you should be noticing improvement.  <br>  <br>  There are some tips to decrease the time it takes to heal.  For one, you need to get more blood flow to the area, so massaging the area gently tends to work a bit. <br>  Also, there are some creams that you can buy over the counter that decrease the appearance.  I am not quite sure how they work, but they are medicinal and they have helped me and my mother in the past.   <br>  Actually, its called witch hazel.  You can get it at the pharmacy and it is not expensive at all.  Also applying VItamin K should help.  <br>  <br>  Try it it and I hope it works!

sTdlAMv7aa	Erection problems may be related to how aroused you are but arousal itself, as well as erection strength, can be affected by hormones, cardiovascular health, stress, etc.  You didn't mention how much sleep you get or what quality it is, which can affect erection strength/erectile function.  Alcohol can make it difficult to get stage IV deep sleep.<br>  <br>  Alcohol also directs hormonal changes that can cause difficulty in getting erect.  Alcohol can prevent estrogen/estradiol from being eliminated, & excess estradiol can diminish libido & erection strength.  In the case of alcohol use, difficulty getting/staying erect (assuming it doesn't instill major performance anxiety) tends to resolve when alcohol has cleared the system.<br>  <br>  A good practice to maintain/increase erection strength is doing kegels.  Doing these for 8-15 min a day 4-6 days per week can help you reach your max.|`|QjP2qtSnaa	Erection size can be related to how turned on you are.  Maybe your tired of the same routine?  Change it up and see what happens.  If that's not the case, it may be a blood flow problem.  Several prescription medications are available as well as natural remedies from vitamin warehouses.  I wouldn't recommend the prescription route unless absolutely necessary.  It makes you dependent on a drug every time you have sex.|`|39KUKALFaa	You should get some Viagra from a doctor and see if it makes a difference.

If it does not go away in a few days, you may need to see your doc.|`|VtWRpxwoaa	On 22 January I thought Id broken my ankle after gracefully slipping on wet grass.... but A&E thought I had torn ligaments....as it was I had actually broke my fibula above the ankle...but when investigating the original injury they asked me if Id heard/felt a 'pop' when I slipped because apparently this is a sign of an achilles tendon injury, possibly a snap...so may pay you to check it out with Doc. Hope you feel better soon..good luck! x
6UBSUzUIaa	As long as she takes the new pack the day after she finishes the old pack, then yes you are fine! Also, if she has missed more than 1 pill at all, then you should use a contraceptive, just in case! Now, if this is a new pack ( like this is the first time she has taken birth control ) then it takes a month for you to be fully protected so you may want to use condoms for that month. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|qh0YrhN5aa	Have you read the pamphlet they give you with the birth control?<br>  <br>  If she has not stopped taking the pills, missed one or anything like it...and is taking the first pill of the pill pack the day following the last pill in the last pack, than you are still safe. Well, as safe as birth control used correctly can be.
yE2vM76naa	That wouldnt make any sense at all.<br>  Wait a few days after the burn has healed before you apply it.|`|CHCPnvksaa	I wouldn't use it because alpha hydroxy is mild acid that could irritate the burn. You're much better off putting aloe vera or sunburn gel on it.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Leave the alpha hydroxy off and the witch hazel..  The neosporin is all that you need.  The alpha will dry the area out and you don't want that.  Neosporin is the only thing recommended for burns.  Apply it twice a day, washing off the residue gently before applying a new coat.|`|xgS6WVd9aa	i would say so....but did it burn when applying it? it might just help relieve pain and not help heal but idk..what can i say i am only 13

L9Q6r42Qaa	oh hunny, that's just something you're born with. You could take estrogen but that will SERIOUSLY mess you up. And may cause problems in the future to get pregnant among other more serious things. Plus you don't want big boobs they cause back problems. Take it from me. I'm 21 years old and have a back of a 50 year old. Do it the safe way. Love the body your parents gave you and if you really want your breasts to look bigger by a seriously padded bra. <br>  <br>  Take care!|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	The only way to increase breast size is to have surgical enhancement or gain weight. Some people who take birth control with estrogen have a slight increase in breast size. People who become pregnant and breastfeed will also have a temporary increase in breast size. As far as foods go, there are none that I know of that increase breast size. Working your pectoral muscles can make the chest a bit bigger, though it is probably not the look you are going for. Some bras help with this, Victoria's Secret Very Sexy line is great.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Implants and weight gain are the only way to make your boobs bigger.  Just eat fattening foods, whatever makes you gain weight.  Big boobs are not as fun as you may think.  I went from a 38DD to a 34B and have never been happier.  I can buy clothes that fit now and NO back pain.|`|WJjr2E0haa	Fist of all why do you want BIG boobs. It is not all its cracked up to be. Look, if you were meant to have natural BIG boobs then you would know it. There are no foods to make your boobs bigger (unless you gain weight and sometimes that doesn't even help). <br>  <br>  I used to have a cup size of an I. That is a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,"i". They are not any fun. They hurt your back, you can't buy regular clothes, and people judge you by what you have up top. <br>  <br>  I am not trying to tell you that you can't have big boobs but think about it first. If you decide that you really want big ones then go buy a pair (usually around $5K-$6K). Oh and when I said "I used to have", I had a breast reduction.|`|T497f0iwaa	I think you should learn to love the breasts you have.  Small breasts are usually very pretty and sexy.  Smaller breasts have a more youthful appearance.<br>  <br>  I certainly wouldn't consider getting breast implants.  Most women who have breast implants regret it.  The fake breasts develop hard scar tissue around the implants.  The implants eventually need to be removed, and all the hard scar tissue needs to be scraped out.  Usually women with breast implants have to get follow-up surgeries.  Please don't mutilate your body.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	They're mostly fat... You could binge on cakes and sugar, if you don't mind the same thing happening to the rest of your body.<br>  <br>  Realistically, neither exercise nor diet will significantly increase their size, especially not quickly.  You either have them or don't.  And since either can be attractive, you're better off accepting them as they are.
8QrfXxaXaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Usually after tooth extraction gel gauze is placed in the socket to ensure clotting. Sometimes the bacteria from the saliva can lodge themselves in the gauze along with food particle debris and result in foul smell and bad taste in the mouth.<br>  I would suggest you to do some warm salt water rinses few times in a day and see. If the bad odor persists please check with your dentist.|`|5I7Ifrmraa	I had the same thing with an abscessed tooth.  Its due to the bacteria that's still lingering in there.  Like a few other have suggested, try a salt water rinse and see the dentist if it does not go away in a few days.  Its possible you will need some antibiotics.|`|LuIFkPfwaa	You don't say what tooth.  Since you said surgically extracted I will assume that it was a wisdom tooth and not infected.  Sometimes, even if you follow all aftercare instructions, a piece(s) of food can get caught in the socket.  If this is what happened in your case then the bad smell is the food decaying.  A quick trip to the dentist to have the socket rinsed out will fix it right up.|`|PvCngXKIaa	Assuming you had the tooth pulled for medical reasons and not cosmetic there is a slight but highly remote chance the residual drainage from the previous abscess is causing the unpleasant odor and taste even though you probably received a stitch or two.  But it would be perfectly normal for you to experience a loss of both bodily fluids other than blood and blood itself, some of which will be clotted.  If your current taste lends itself to slightly salty then it's blood which will diminish and stop altogether in a day or two.  Remember, the tongue is pretty sensitive.  If your problem doesn't stop in the next day or two or if you begin to experience additional pain you should contact your doctor for advice.|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	It sounds like the tooth was infected. If the Dentist did not prescribe antibiotics then you need to call them and have them call in a prescription for you. Take all of the medicine prescribed.|`|EMbaak9waa	It would be the infection of the tooth that got pulled out, it will go away in a few days.<br>  Did your doctor prescribe you antibiotics for that?<br>  I'm assuming that's what it is.|`|Gmlv2Ou2aa	go for a check up with the dentist. after extraction the site can get infected and give bad smell

PAhdlQ5eaa	You can work out as much or as little as you want.  You can do cardio work and abdominals everyday.  If you are doing weight training along with it, then you can either do all major muscle groups every other day (typically Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) or you can do all upper body on Mon., Wed., Fri., and then lower body on Tues, and Thurs.  Or you can flip those.<br>  <br>  There is no limit to how much you can workout.  You will be sore for a while if you do weight training and working the muscles hard, that's normal.  Just do not over do it.  Always allow muscle groups to heal at least one day (example, you work your upper body on monday, dont lift upper body again until wednesday) before working them hard again.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend though doing cardio and abs 5-7 days a week, and then weight training 3-5 days a week depending on if you wanna lift weights everyday, or every other day.|`|AA10832514	You should always allow your body time to heal after working out.

We have Kaiser health insurance, like you. Although many times Dr's have listened to his heart, none seemed very worried about it.  Most of the time, irregular heartbeats are harmless, they'd say. However, if there are other medical problems, including obesity, & high blood pressure, it can be serious enough for a person to have sudden death from cardiac failure.  Since my husband's blood pressure has been creeping up over the last few years and he has abdominal obesity, I began to push for further testing.  We've been married 25 years and he's always hated going to the Dr's and would minimize everything to them.  As you probably already know, with kaiser, you HAVE to push and complain and tell them what YOU want them to do.  Unfortunately, most people do not have enough medical knowledge to even realize they need to push for certain diagnostics.  My husband has other medical problems that he has been ignoring, so I pushed him, and he finally made an appt. for a full physical.  You know how men are---they tend to wait until a crisis happens before they'll address medical problems. So I went with him, and I tattled about his high fat sugary diet, his snoring, sleep apnea, and his constant tiredness.  The Dr. immediately was able to recognize a pronounced arrythmia and had an EKG done right then and there. It showed a significant skipped beat about every 3rd beat.  His bloodwork showed extremely high triglycerides (750) and his total cholesterol was 330, and he has low "good" cholesterol and high "bad"cholesterol.  I printed up his bloodwork and showed my husband how far out of normal ranges he was. It was so scary--I told him he was going to die if he didn't change.  I guess I scared him enough that he quit drinking coca cola cold turkey---2 liters a day worth!!  Then, we began to do the grocery shopping together, choosing low (or non) fat and sugar foods.  We paid close attention to saturated fats, too.  Instead of his usual Mc Donald's Big breakfast he would get every morning on his way to work (for years!), he began to cook organic oatmeal with ground flax and soy lethicin added.  He went from whole milk to nonfat with a dash of chocolate soymilk added for tatse. Hey, Rome wasn't built in a day...haha.  Within 2 weeks of this, his Dr. notified him of his terrible bloodwork, and the need for cholesterol lowering meds, along with further heart testing.  I told the Dr about how I already got the bloodwork and we have been on a strict diet since then.  Well, 3 weeks into this new diet, he showed up for his stress test.  He was going to have the treadmill workout and the resting xrays with the cardiac dye injectiont into his coronary arteries so they could see if he had clogged arteries.  Thankfully, his heart test was normal!  But get this; there was NO more irregular heartbeat!!!  It had disappeared completely. How about that?  We found out that it can be caused by poor diet alone as well.  In his case, a high sugar and high fat diet!  So there you go. Make a Dr appointment and push for an ekg--they are cheap and fast to get done, right there at the kaiser medical offices.  If they see irregularities, they will take it from there.  Although electrical irregularities of the heart are often harmless, there are certain kinds that can be dangerous.  EKG's will reveal what type you have.  Go check it out...and if you are a sugar addict and love high fat foods, tackle that!  Good luck, I hope you are OK :)|`|mAp90hEeaa	Intermittent periods of a fast heart rate or short bursts of an irregular heart rate can occur during periods of stress, fatigue, too much exercise, illness, too much smoking, street drug use and too much caffeine.  Most of these do not cause any problems with the heart and if you determine the underlying cause (one of the above) and change that factor, they often go away.  Only if the fast beats do not go away is when you need to seek medical attention because they will have to give you drugs to slow down your heart.  You can also go to WebMd and read up on palpitations (type in this term) and see if your symptoms match.  Common sense will tell you that if it gets worse and worse, you need to see your doctor.
