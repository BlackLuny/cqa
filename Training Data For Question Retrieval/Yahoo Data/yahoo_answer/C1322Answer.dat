cKL9AD0Jaa	Exactly what Congress is planning to do, after they have converted their dollars to gold.    That's why they have started a campaign telling you that deflation is bad, inflation is your friend.    Buying power is what counts, and it is dropping like a stone, thanks to the Bush Depression.|`|r52rfBkeaa	If the government prints more money, it means more money is in circulation and it causes inflation and everything will be more expensive (because in theory, people have more money to spend on items b/c there's more in circulation).      What needs to happen is the companies who are failing, need to fail.  It's their own fault that they got into this mess... like the big car companies.  They took advantage of the low interest rate that the government was lending money at and in turn lending money to people who didn't have sufficient income to pay it back.  That's how the housing mess got this way too.    So, the less money in circulation, the more value it has.  Imagine if there were only 5 $1 bills in the whole country and you had one - you'd be pretty powerful, right?  That's the idea.  We're experiencing a bit of deflation at the moment.  People don't have cash - they've used credit (loans and cards) to purchase things and don't really have access to cold hard cash to buy things anymore.  The credit companies are tightening up their requirements b/c they've given out money to people who couldn't pay it back too... so, rates have gone up (to protect the credit companies) and people are suffering.    The idea of printing a bunch of money is how we got into this mess to begin with... credit companies and banks (and people too) thought it was easy to buy things b/c the rate was so low... this means people could buy things without really being able to afford it.    And actually, the economy can be predicted.  You just have to look at the historical trends... remember the saying, "history repeats itself?"  It 100% applies.|`|pnZssBg9aa	I agree with PakPanja, it will only increase inflation and the money supply and make the US dollar worthless.  That was what they did in Germany during the 1920s when Germany suffered hyperinflation - they kept on printing lots of Reichmarks that a single bread loaf would cost thousands of Reichmarks.|`|mWLTYAoWaa	this is what they did in Zimbabwe, and look what happened, hyper-inflation !!!    increase in money supply will lead to an increase in inflation|`|hafFbjm8aa	ALL RIGHT!!!

That's smart, but if that happens, we will all loose our jobs and houses. All we can say at this point is "I pray that obama will lead us out of this depression."|`|lUe3IRozaa	The more money there is in circulation, the less it is worth. Printing more isn't the solution, since even printing money costs... you guessed it. money.    Though millions of bills are printed every day, abused bills are also being taken out of circulation. It really depends on the economy, and the economy my friend, is something that can not be predicted, but only guessed at.|`|l3Wq57gsaa	more money equals more inflation. the price of everything will go up like crazy because there is more money. just like how the price of a pepsi has gone up in 40 years- however it would be more rapid. this site explains inflation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation|`|0wZcKn8Zaa	in 1965 minimum wage was $1.25 a new home cost $23,300. a stamp was .05 a gallon of gas was .32 and a gallon of milk was .99.

jiMAtaCraa	All resources are scarce, because the resources in a given economy can not fulfill the needs and wants of every individual in society.|`|cjQrn5ODaa	Seems like credit is in short supply right now, once it returns we will go back to scarcity of all the usual suspects again (oil, metals, etc.), as the world economy is fundamentally still the same.|`|GR8jsGgLaa	Oil....

Look at China, they had to shut down factories to prevent Olympics from being cancelled on account of smog.    It is true that oil and other mineral resources are getting more scarce than they were before. Same for forests and fisheries. Labor and capital are getting less scarce.    Thinking that some resource is not scarce is a misconception that leads to overuse of that resource.

If supply is low and price is high then the following season more farmers will enter the market because of attractiveness but price will then lower because of increased supply.|`|4H4dUBkGaa	Farming is close to a perfectly competitive industry (depending on the commodity). That means that profit opportunities are limited. Of course, places with attributes like extremely fertile soil and very cheap labor should have an advantage in that regard.     Having an economy based on farming is also risky because a bad year is likely to be a bad year for everyone in the economy. When the economy is more diversified problems can be more evenly distributed over time so that people can help each other out (or the government can redistribute income or people can buy insurance).
IJTcGIG7aa	Good general, wrong side.    The black mark on Lee and many of our founding fathers is that they were slave holders.   I don't think any fair assessment can be done without that point.    Yes, it was legal at the time and Lee fell into Plantation ownership, but the economics doesn't justify the moral questions which had been asked for 100's of years before Lee was born.    With that one bold exception, Lee wasn't a bad person overall.

f2cQrG7jaa	Body language is key I think. You can see how willing someone is to go through what they are going through by how their body holds resistance to that change. People watching is easier with dark sunglasses. Sex catches peoples' interest. I don't suggest coming up with conclusions about people's reactions because that all depends on "your" intent. Instead just see how they react and keep asking questions about it, never coming to a conclusion. That's how you explore it best.     Smiling has a huge impact. I am hypnotized by a smile, especially a girl's. I don't think that age and race are as important as gender is. I think that the difference between guys and girls is the most interesting thing to me.    I hope that my opinion encourages you.|`|m85emlXyaa	There is an experiment that was conducted that may be of interest to you.

Basically, to prove if people where more honest when people were being watched or felt like they were being watched.
0F8hauikaa	Probably just because it's more common. I've once saw a movie about husband abuse that made me aware that it goes both ways. I think it can be uncomfortable and embarrasing to talk about for men and women, but probably more so for men.     Some facts on the subject.    Most reported cases of spousal abuse involve violence by men against women.     However, there are a significant minority of cases involving violence by women against men, violence by same-sex partners or where both parties act out violently against one another.     Men tend not to report spousal abuse at the same rate as women; partly because they diminish the impact themselves and partly because society, media, police and courts also tend to diminish its impact.    It may be pointed out, however, that while the simple tally of violent acts might be similar, studies show that men's violence usually does much more damage than women's; women are much more likely to be injured and/or hospitalized.    Wives are much more likely to be killed by their husbands than the reverse, and women in general are more likely to be killed by their spouse than by all other types of assailants combined.|`|yJNOQ91uaa	You're right, most information is based on the assumption that the victim/survivor is female and the perpetrator is male.  This is because statistics show that most perpetrators are male and the vast majority of victims are female.  However men get raped and abused too.  Below are some resources for male victim/survivors.  The nsw health one has PDFs of two excellent booklets for men - When a man is raped, and  Who can a man tell?    For information for men being abused in same sex relationships, try the gay and lesbian counselling service site.  It has lots of information and links.    I hope they help.
cJPOs7Tsaa	When I was taking Zyban in effort to quit smoking, it induced lots of crazy, lucid dreams. In my favorite, I was walking along a path through the clouds admiring these huge, beautiful mushroom shaped structures. Their stalks would rise out of the abyss below me, and the caps were enormous. Dangling from the perimeter of the caps were all these stringy things with points of light moving up and down them. Vibrant glowing colors would seem to scintillate from the caps downward, in an ever-changing spectacular display. Reds, blues, greens, gold, purple, yellow, silver... The colors would continually appear to wash down from the top, replacing one another.     Well, that was how they looked from far away. As I continued walking down the path towards them, it became evident what the dangling stringy things were. They were elevators. Tens of thousands of elevators, carrying some sort of beings up into a city contained within the caps. I sat down in awe, and admired all the beauty and technology. These mushrooms were like the most beautiful things I'd ever seen, and I couldn't stop staring at them.     This is where the dream gets weird (no, seriously it's not weird yet). So, I'm staring up at these huge things when suddenly all the caps start rippling. Previously motionless, they are all jiggly now. The rippling gradually becomes more intense, and they all eventually start "flapping," like a jelly-fish movement. Eventually, the caps lift off of the stalks, and start to "swim" away, with the dangling elevator strings behind them.     I was upset that these beautiful jelly-fish cities were leaving. I didn't even take a ride in the elevator. I never got to see the cities from the inside. I think this is where I woke up. I remember being really pissed off that I was awake, I wanted to go back sooooo bad. The psychadelic jelly-fish-mushroom cities were the niftiest place I've ever been!|`|oaiL6vnuaa	ok. a few weeks ago, i was sick, and i felt like crap. while i was sick, i had some of the weirdest dreams ever. the scaryest dream was the first night. this dream put me in a fantasy world in which every aspect of the landscape was at war. there were chairs fighting beds which were fighting tables. pieces would fly off, and broken pieces would come together to form new "creatures", and join the fighting. it was intense|`|9mfCbTvNaa	umm  i guess it was when i was about 5 or 6.  Each night i had the same dream iver and over again. It was more of a nightmare actually  but anyway, i live in a small village, and i went to the local primary school at the time. My best friend was a chinese girl who lived down the road from me, and each night for about a month i would dream that i was walking with her at night, and we turned a corner, and about 200m up the road was my school.  Each night i would see someone standing outside the school gates, and they would turn around, and the moon would shine onto their hand and they would be carrying a gun.  The person would then see me, aim and shoot me, each night right in the heart. then, i would fall into the road dead.   I have no idea where my friend was in all of this, but later on in the dream, as it turned into mornign, my other friend who had moved to New Zealand (lucky *****) would walk around the corner and see me lying dead in the road. Then i would wake up.  I had this dream over and over again, and i got more scared as the nights went by.  I dreaded going to bed as i knew that this nightmare that really freaked me out at the time would come and haunt me in my sleep.|`|uJFc9y0Faa	okay i got to say there's two really freaky dreams i had. one was that i was on a skateboard with a dachshund and we were basically just riding through the hilly streets of our suburban town. But it was really cool and pretty fun because it was like you could really feel that you were riding, and the wind in your hair. And you couldn't see yourself. It wasn't like in TV where you can see yourself acting when you watch the show. Another dream (or really a series of dreams) was when I was in kindergarten. They were like these little balls that looked like marbles or electrons illustrated in a science book, solid orange and blue. They all flowed together in a river like motion through some kind of tunnel i would believe, but i couldn't really see it because this dream was also in my view. This series persisted for a few months and ocasionally came back after a year. I used to be really scared of them at that time because when ever you close your eyes or even blink it'd come back! One time even when my eyes where open I still saw them. It was creepy when I was so small lol.|`|qs2LyiM6aa	what do you mean by freakiest ? lol ive had lots of weird dreams though when i was about 6 i dreamt that i was kidnapped and was kepted hostage in an attic by this man and women i had the same dream once a year for 3 years.|`|cz4zO8wYaa	lol... yahoo answers isn't really for asking personal questions  but my freakiest dream was when i was alone in this white  box for ever and i could not die and all i could do was sit and wait (i woke up and started talking to my brother to make me forget about it)|`|nRnokrwKaa	So I'm walking along in my dream, think it was along where this big dual-carriageway is near where I live, but rather than being road it is covered in grass like a park. I'm walking along it calmly, in no rush to get anywhere,  and I'm going through my thoughts when, suddenly, I'm falling upwards! My body feels like its still in the position it was when I was standing, and I'm not tumbling or anything, but I feel like I'm falling, with the world getting smaller below me... It was terrifying, i've had it several times actually, each time starting off in different places. Wonder what it means in a sort of psycho-analytical sense? Probably that I'm bonkers :)|`|S4QBvAaGaa	Freaky as in Sexysex or just bizarre?  As per bizarre, I lucid dream so every dream ends up becoming a bizarre dream, usually concluding to my satisfaction of course. The most bizarre dream I think I've had so far was one where I met an Angel. It was lucid but it felt so real that I have the most bizarre feeling not to put it in the random dream file. It was a very deeply emotional dream and I met a very beautiful woman who I could not see at first but she was "glowing" and I felt absolutely light and peaceful...that makes no sense but it was a very bizarre dream.   As per sexysex, it had to do with a fire hydrant. The End.  Good Luck! :)
hKy1blrqaa	Well you sure do have a complex situation. I will try to give you the best answer I can. The first thing you have to do is think about your feelings for this guy as opposed to your boyfriend. Once your boyfriend gets out of jail, and it seems like its going to be soon, do you still want to be with him or will you find yourself wishing to be with the other guy? If your feelings for the 'one time' guy are strong and you can't seem to let him go, then just wait it out, keep in touch with him and let your boyfried know that some things have changed and that you need time. The scary thing about casual dating, or planning to have only a sexual relationship with someone is that it almost always leads to real and true feelings that you werent expecting so I don't blame you for caring about him. All you need to do is figure out who you want to be with. And it seems to me like that guy cares for you as well. It's hard for guys to admit that sometimes, so you have to pay close attention to his actions. If he really wanted just a one time thing with you, he would have been out of your life after the first time you had sex. I wish you the best and I hope it all works out for you!
6oKjh6e3aa	There isn't really much you can do except be there for her when she needs you.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Wow psychology is a much nastier room than Philosophy.    A woman would say "I feel so badly for my mom, and she feels so badly" Men want to "fix things" women speak in terms of relating.    So that would make me assume you were a male.    Geeze I answered the wrong question.  I answered this one in Philosophy, okay?|`|pe415yQAaa	Give her money.|`|h9aNv6PDaa	I'm so sorry to hear your story.    The best thing I think you could do is to spend time with your family, doing fun things together with them!|`|6eed3c6ed1117fe6baa4febd3849d742aa	What a PUTZ this doctor is!!    A person is not to blame or praise for his genetic makeup!!  Or for not knowing about it for all those years.  Of course your grandfather and mother realize this at some level.  The heredity news is a cause for sorrow, but not guilt, and that's what you should clarify and reassure for them.       There is enough pain and suffering going on here that mutual comfort, love and support is all that is called for among yourselves.    I recommend that you go to some AS websites and research the mechanics of the heredity angle.  I wonder why he thinks your mother got it from your grandfather, as neither of your grandparents seem to have it.  AS does not seem to be cancer-related, so I would not put much stock in this doctor's non-cancer expertise, not to mention his "bedside manner"!!    And lastly, I hope you can look into hospice care for your grandpa.  I wish you the best.|`|ToILKl6waa	I'm sorry for this rough patch in your life and it is so sweet of you to want to help your loved ones. Things happen. However, you must be strong for both you and your family.     Your mother needs you at a time like this. She needs your reassurances, your support, your love, your comfort - YOU. Let her know she's appreciated and devote your time talking to her - perhaps trying to get her mind off the disease. You have it in you and all of this is only making you internally stronger.  Be there for your grandparents too. They need you. I advise you to make them a decorative card to show your admiration.     Best wishes to you. Try not to worry. God is always with you.|`|e7qwfj55aa	dont ever refer to your mother by saying "poor mother"  shes not a dog  and shes older than you  show her respect  shes not a baby  you could help her by showing her shes the adult.
deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	?????    You seem to think that people understanding that women are human beings needs explanation. You also seem to assume all feminists are women.    Both my parents were feminists. After the divorce, we lived with our dad.    I would probably have realized I'm human whatever my upbringing. Though the whole notion of full human rights for all humans was something I got from my parents.    Being a SAHM is perfectly compatible with being a feminist. As is being a SAHD.|`|AHpS6qPDaa	My dad is my best friend. He was a single dad after my mum walked out. He's taught me about all the important things in life. He's taught me to act like a lady and to respect my peers and they will respect and appreciate me in return. He's encouraged me to pursue my dreams, whatever they may be, and he's always been my number one dad.    I couldn't ask for a better man in my life and his left some pretty big footsteps for my boyfriend to follow.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I looked up to my father because A: we had more in common, personality wise, and because he was the breadwinner.    I never respected my mother for not working while my father struggled to pay rent, bills, and tuition for 3 kids.  I didn't respect her at all.  I especially didn't respect the fact that she had to ask my father for money, as if she was one of us.  It was shameful to me.    My mother has a very old-fashioned, damsel-in-distress way of looking at things.  My father would have been proud of the fact that I have my own mind.|`|mZVk3fP4aa	I couldn't stand either one of them.|`|pLByqcWQaa	I was raised by a single mother who felt it was very important for me to be independent and think for myself.  My feminist ideals have come from leaving an environment where my independence was expected and assumed and entering the real world where I have come across a shocking number of men who assume I don't know what I'm talking about and/or I'm stupid because I lack testicles.|`|ihkmIdtmaa	Well I had an equally close relationship with my mother and father.     Both of my parents were fairly progressive though. My mom is the "bread winner" and my dad identifies as a feminist, so I was told from essentially birth that I was just as capable as any boy. My parents encouraged me to be whoever I wanted, play with whatever toys and become active in whatever interested me. It happened to be law and politics for me, a very male dominated field.  And, this might offend some, but my dad pretty much told me I was too intelligent to be a SAHM and that I would be wasting a lot of potential.     I think anti-feminists could have had a close relationship with their father, but perhaps their father held more traditional beliefs. Mine didn't.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	Yes, I was closer to my dad and I still am to this day.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	My mother is not a feminist type, but I am by far closer to her than I was to my father.    My feminist ideas were probably from an upbringing that featured no safety or security at home, and a self-loathing of poor people that was quickly blown to bits once I got some education and stopped being such a pissant.|`|wkjncmHTaa	No, I'd say I was closer to my mother. She was the one I would go to with any problems, though my father was usually the one to look after us when we were sick. I think I'm more similar to my dad in many ways, and probably I do try to be like him more than my mother. Not that I don't love my mother, but she is quite traditional and stereotypically female, and that's just not really me.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	My parents were never married, and I rarely saw him. My mom and I moved across the country when I was 9 and didn't see him again until I was 17. At 17 I invited him out to stay with me and found out he was dying.  I at least was able to have that time to get to know him.|`|en628a4haa	I never saw much of my father, so I have to say I was much closer to my mother. She was a SAHM when I was little, but she was definitely a feminist even then. She always told me that staying at home was her choice, and not something you had to do just because you were a woman.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	I absolutely couldn't stand my father growing up.  If he so much as said, "Please pass the salt," something about the way he said it would annoy me.  My mom was the one who tried to keep the peace.  My mom has a PhD and worked in the same field as my dad. Nobody ever expected me to be a housewife.  My dad made me learn all kinds of things that I didn't really feel like learning, pointing out that I needed to be a "fully functioning adult."  Like everything my dad did or said, it annoyed the snot out of me.  In retrospect, it was a good idea though.    I'm still a lot closer to my mom than to my dad.  We chat online every day, but I only talk to my dad maybe once every couple months. I do like my dad, in general, and I admire his upbeat attitude, but we're not exactly on the same wavelength.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	I was close to my mom growing up, since she wasn't the one beating me and telling me I was stupid-but my dad did the same thing to my brothers, so it wasn't based on my gender, my dad was just a vicious bully. Both my parents are christian fundies, my dad a minister, but we were dead broke, so in spite of my dad hating it, my mom went back to school, got her degree, and supported us-she's the reason we all got to go to college-but she also left us with a sadistic violent mental case.     I always admired my mom's spunk, and will forever be grateful I was able to go to college, but in later years, I regret having been left with such a sick and violent man for years on end, who literally tortured my younger brothers and myself. I became agnostic after praying that she would leave him and of course, she never did. They're still together, and he's still nutty as a fruitcake. I avoid them like the plaque. I can't take the hypocrisy-everyone thinks they're so wonderful.They were-to everyone but their family. For some reason, I have a low opinion of the nuclear family and marriage. I know not all families and marriages are like that, but let's just say, 18 years was long enough for me. I left home at 18 and never lived with them again.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	No, to be quite honest, my dad was working a lot when I was a kid.  I certainly idealized him and loved him, but I was much closer to my mom.    She wasn't really a feminist type, either.  I guess I got it independently.|`|FL67UPPHaa	I don't identify as a feminist, but I was closer to my dad. I've always got along better with men, and I find they understand and appreciate me more, even though I'm very feminine in nature.    I get on well with my mum too, but we clashed a lot when I was growing up. I think it was just because she was the "practical" parent whereas my dad was the "fun" parent.    My mum was a part-time SAHM and part-time worker, but she's the one with the strongest and most dominant personality. My parent's roles appear to be quite traditional at first, but I'd say my mum was always the head of household. She made nearly all the decisions.    I admire both my parents, they work hard and cared for me well. I haven't always agreed with their choices, or their expectations of me, but I know they just wanted the best for me. I think having parents who worked well together and had a stable marriage helped to shape my belief in gender equality, although that wasn't the only thing. I had good role models.    I was never encouraged into any particular gender role, but I have a feminine personality and I'd love to be a SAHM when I get married. I've made sure I can be independent too though, which I probably got from my mum. She loved being a SAHM, but she was always her own person too.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	Oh no, I rejected everything my parents believed in.  They were total opposites.  I did love my father's more laid back approach but his lack of morals and his selfishness really freaked me out, along with his drinking and womanizing.  My mother was a religious nut who believed that a woman's place was serving her lord and master.  She had no other reason to be on this earth.  According to my mother, God would reward good women in Heaven - their reward was not on this earth.  My mother did work part time, and so do I.  We learnt the hard way not to rely totally on a man.    So you see, bits and pieces.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	No, the closeness with my father is a relatively recent phenomenon. I still go to my mother when I have emotional problems (rarely), but my father and I are much more alike, so I get a lot of my political and social ideas from him.|`|rpajoT0raa	No I wasn't. He had very conservative and prejudiced views, was not loving and he would not pay child support. My mother had to raise me without his help... and she was my role model. She was - and still is - incredibly resourceful and resilient and she raised me to be a loving person,to value education, to eat healthy food, to have some fun in life and to tell the truth. The complete opposite of my father - haha!     I would say that she was a feminist by example and, although very educated, she didn't actually discuss feminist theory. I grew up being completely unaffected by gender role distinctions - we are just capable human beings who may reap equal rewards for equal hard work - which is why I react in shock & disgust when anyone tries being sexist towards me. Stupidity and misogyny really p*ss me off. Feminism is still necessary.     I am so grateful to feminists for making it possible for my mother to give me a good life and raise me right.

If I'm in loose fitting clothes with loud colors, I feel like my personality is being expressed - thus it makes me feel comfortable in my own skin.

oZPLI8Y5aa	DO not fall to negatives and reject the person without due cause.   It is possible you are wrong and even if not it is better to simply be understanding with the person you are befriending.     You can be supportive without going to negatives. This is kind of like tearing down others to build yourself up by proxy. Instead - build the person up based on their strengths. Let their merits stand alone instead of using comparisons to tear down the other person|`|AA10067344	I think by catering to your one friend's insecurities you're really just helping to reinforce them.|`|45WBZkJRaa	To put it simply: If someone is wrong, whether it is your friend or your mother, they are wrong and I wouldn't play the sitting on the fence game. It's not me. I hate bullies, simple.|`|pzaAIlCBaa	Go with your instinct.|`|qKtZXDQNaa	NO I would never fake rejection of my friend but I would noy put down the insecure person.

This is true no matter what type of feminist you are.    -There's also a movement in feminism that wants to see more gender roles broken down for men, aka have have men not be afraid to be seen as "gay" or whatever for taking care of kids, teaching, etc.      -Also a lot of feminists (not all) are aligned with gay tolerance and transgender issues, and they want to see greater acceptance of GLBT folk by both men and women.    -And of course, pro-choice feminists (who are probably a majority of feminists, but again, not all), want to see guys to be hands off of abortion and choice issues.|`|pLByqcWQaa	To not be resented or seen as a "femmi-nazi" or otherwise for standing up for woman's rights and for pointing out the inequalities that still exist in our society.

And to be able to interact with men without getting an emotional REACTION to anything we do or say. Women are not mothers first, sexpots first, feminists first, housewives first, we are PEOPLE first, just like men, and the inability of so many men to see women outside whatever roles were brainwashed into them during childhood is disheartening. It amazes me every day that the men who complain about women being "emotional" and "reactive" can't have the most basic conversation with men OR women without posturing, complaining, throwing insults, or rebelling like a child. Feminism is not "Fem Nazi", just like wanting equal rights for all races is not being a Nazi.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Independence. Freedom.     That or the absence of men.

So if I was you I would do something about it before you start pissing off family and friends. Either go see a psychiatrist and get an evaluation and medication. If your afraid of what you might hear then research your symptoms on the Internet and go to GNC and fine some natural remedy for mood disorders and take that. Personally, it sounds like you have BiPolar and your just afraid to admit it. If you research to disorder on the Internet you would find that it is a treatable disorder and you can go on to live a productive normal life. The longer you go on without a doctor's care the longer you make your situation work.

And if your mind is occupied with other things more often, you won't have so much time to worry about being her number one.

e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	Yes, it is both physically and mentally challenging.    To me, you need to be able to suppress your ego and think about your fellow soldiers as a band of brothers for whom you are willing to sacrifice your life.    If you are an independent minded person who values self preservation over all other choices, then you may have a hard time adjusting to the military way.

But the reason corporations have been getting large sums of money is because they are made up of millions of people. Not to mention, the thousands of employment positions they offer. So ideally, everyone receives a fair share in this money handout; but letting corporations that root themselves financially in millions can produce higher risk costs if ignored. If the government were to simply let wallstreet burn, this would have come close, or have become, a depression.    Oh and you can also take into account income inequality. If we assume that corporations are made up of the higher class, we can take on a different perspective. The income inequality in the US is such that the top 20% (high class) of households hold 50% of the nation's wealth. By helping this minority, you ensure that at least 50% of the nation's wealth overall is secured.|`|cHaRg3fkaa	Like Thomas' answer.  To it I would add if you gave the taxpayers the money they would spend mos tof it and thus shift aggregate demand upward and to the right.  Good for the economy, but not necessarily good for those they bailed out since not all of the money spent by the taxpayers would go to the firms bailed out.  In essence, they wanted to protect many US jobs from disappearing during an economic crisis by propping up inefficient firms.  Additionally it was to stabilize the liquidity crisis spurred on by Wall Street gougers/profiteers and the lack of US regulation of financial markets.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	We are not even getting our state tax returns on time!

eBZdl7Sraa	I think you should experiment.  Eat a little piece of cheese tonight and see if you have a nightmare.  If you don't, then eat more the next night.  In this way, you can find the minimum required amount of cheese.    It's bound to give you a nightmare eventually- if nothing else, you will get an upset stomach and that will disturb your sleep.

cbZdeOSPaa	:0 Wow!!! Dude, don't take this the wrong way but you're just going through puberty!! It's the time when everyone wants independence and I understand how you feel, I'm going through the same things but I try to control myself because I know that our bodies are going through changes and this affects our mood and blah, blah...yeah I'm going scientific on you because this helps you understand yourself a bit more... anyway, sometimes this makes us angry for no particular reason, makes us feel lonely, makes us want to destroy things, etc. Since I'm the middle child I sometimes feel like the black sheep of the family, so I totally understand you, but you have to learn how to control your feelings because some day you'll look back in time and you'll regret and laugh at it. So hang in there buddy, it's just a few more years for you...and one more year for me...yes I'll be 19 this year!!! No I'm not asking you to go hippie or Barney lover,  just don't hate us all okay!

yyXs05kwaa	From my perspective, emotions are not felt in the mind or the heart. They are physiological responses...    When Im scared, my heart races, pounds in my chest. It "feels" pretty much the same as if Im on a treadmill for an hour.    When Im in love, my stomach feels queasy. I feel empty, and sick. Some call it love, missing your love, in need of your love. So when I want to tell a girl that I love her, I tell her that she makes me feel queasy.    I feel emotional pain in my heart. I know its not caused by physical damage, it feels different. But it is felt in the heart nonetheless. Its a heartache, that feels little different than what you would take an alkaseltzer for. Who is to say that the pain isnt actually there?    There is more than one physiological response in combination... which form an emotion. But all emotion can be described with physical parameters... I think.    Without the body to manifest these responses, I dont think the human mind could perceive them.    Hope this helps|`|ZEaM2y05aa	Things trigger different chemicals to be released at certain times from your brain.

This is not always true, it does not mean that someone who was powerless will grow up to be like hitler, that person may become interested in helping people that are powerless once he is out of that state himself.

3MC627quaa	1.  I have had hundreds of dreams that were of people or me dying, being chased, or catastrophic events. Once, I dreamed I was at home and relaxing with my twin sister. Then intruders broke into our house and I ran to my mother and brother who were watching a movie in her bedroom. The intruders had planned to rob and kill us but could not penitrate this weird force field around the bed. Somehow, I got out of the bed and ran to the master bathroom, climbed out the window, down the roof, and onto the ground. Suddenly this white foam started falling from  the sky and I started running as fast as I could. I came upon a great lake with dolphins and mermaids. I swam across the water to a small tropical island in the middle. Just when I had gotten on shore the lake disappearned and it became a pit of lava. Huge crowds of people surrounded the lava's edge and chanted in a foreign tongue. I was tied to the ground as lava begin to cover me. So, in the end I was sacrificed to something. I woke up after that.    2. I was out in the city and was walking through a bad neighborhood in the nightitme. I was grabbed, muffled, and then taken away. A bunch of guys keept beating me up until I got knocked out. When I woke uop ( still in the dream) I couldn't find anyone and didn't know where I was but I just knew I had been raped. I cryed until I woke up in real life to find myself perfectly fine.     3. I dreamed this around the same time as 911. I was in my school classroom which happend to be a trailer right outide of my school as there was a student surplus. We were working and learning when military tanks crushed the playground and benches near our school. Thousands of soldiers marched in and one broke into our classroom. He shot my best friend and twin sister and was about to shoot me when I woke up.       So there you go. Those are some crazy ones, but definitley not all.|`|AA11311567	Every now and then, I get a dream that I am scheduled to be executed.

8ebrivqHaa	I struggled with social anxiety for over 7 years.  I couldn't even bear to sit with my mom over coffee it got that bad.  I felt like I was on a roller coaster and panic would strike severely.  I wondered what the hell happenned I was never like this? What was wrong with me?   After many books and various drugs to calm me down they weren't the answer.  What I found to correct this phobia is !)  Start believing in yourself and quit kicking your own *** 2) Roll with it-If you have an attack who cares?  You are your worst enemy-you need to realize that u are causing your own fears.. people aren't looking at you under a microscope..seriously 3)  Accept it..hey I am only human..I dont care if I get nervous anymore I am not gonna die  believe in yourself my friend and stop kicking your own *** and you will get better.  I still at times have few moments but I just forget about it and move on.. you need to desensitize your nerves....  Smile! You are a good person!!!.good luck..|`|OUbNSXjJaa	You do not worry. The questionnaire will be simple. They will ask for basic details about your name, address, qualification, etc.    As for my thoughts, they will give you treatment and bring you back to normal or original state.
8yE2sYGeaa	You feel that this is the only way to meet women (at costco! Well, I certainly would go more often if they were available!) and perhaps feel that you lack the emotional commitment for a "real" relationship
OPQcefpRaa	Erm, A bit of a Toughie one to actually answer without knowing just a few more details, but I'll try my best, to help you with any kinda half decent answer.    Well although not fully relevant, I wonder why your Family don't think he's the Guy for you, is there or what is the reasons behind why they don't like him, (maybe, and if you don't mind me asking / saying), his he in to any kind of criminal action, like in a gang or does drugs or anything like that, do you know, (or maybe that you are unaware of), is so that's one possible reason why they might feel he's no good for you, just saying. so if as far as you know he does not do anything like that, then there should really be no real reason why your family should be upset by going out with him. it's your choice who you go out with. so maybe you could sit down with your family and actually ask why they are not happy with him, and tell them, if they can't give you 1 or more relevant reason why you should give him up, then say how much you really do love him, and in the right term / way / putting it in to the right words that sounds right, and try not to upset them even further, " Why can't you just accept that I Love him, and please let me be happy, I don't want to upset you any more then necessary, but can u let me get on with my life, (of course I stress, that I don't know how old you are, or your boyfriend is,or even what the age gap is, as it can be important to as exactually what you say and how you sat it, etc).   since you've been with him for 2 years he should understand why you introduced him as a friend, (which I can't understnd, if he didn't / doesn't understand), if not you'll just hav eto explane to him why you did it,(that your family don't like him),and get him to understand, he must understand, and say you didn't mean to hurt him, but you had to do it, not to upset your family, (Family alway comes before friends and in your case B/F. you can appologise for doing it, ask for forgiveness, (but Dont Grovle / Never Grovle), but he's got to understand, that you seem to be in the middle of loving your family and him, and you don't want to upset any of  them. the problem is You can't please everyone all the time,(though it sounds like you are trying to),sometimes you got to put yourself 1st.and say, " All I want to be is happy, and not liking him, is making you unhappy. also how much does He really Love you.   Sorry I just seem to be rambling on too much, But I do Hope all this, make some sense, and help you in one way or another, and hope in the end I didn't confuse you,  I wish you all the Best.   Try not to worry to much, or stress yourself out too much.  I believe things always work themselves out one way or another, and things happen for a reason, we just got to find out what those reason are, and how to make them work beeter for us all.
4cLCFy6Vaa	At times yeh. sometimes u can be in love to the point that ur speechless and dont kno wat to say to them. like saying : "Please dont ask me what i like bout you, becasue its every little thing you do, and thats just the way you make me feel." - song: Hey Now, by : FM Static.|`|uXQcDsiAaa	yap. Philosophist, psychologist... have tried to describe love it self but have failed. Technically, it is impossible to describe it. But on the other hand; it's not. See, love is like bein' in "like" 10000000times(u can go on with the zeros forever). When u love somebody, it's IMPSBLE to unlove them.
ToILKl6waa	You have your whole life ahead of you. The teen years are always the worst with an immense amount of pressure burdening your life. Believe it or not though, things do improve.     When you get past whatever temporary problem you're struggling with, happiness is a terrific feeling that makes you feel on top of the world. If you want that, don't let depression get the worst of you. Set goals for yourself and strive to attain them.     You are in control of the depression. The depression is not in control of you.|`|tezNJNGKaa	You just gave yourself the reason to live.  Make a life for yourself, see how you turn out.  There's no time to be depressed, I'm sure you are better than that and could be doing more important things than moping around. If its a serious depression, go to a psychologist and sort it out.  :)|`|5VdB8njTaa	Because things get better when you try and make them better ;)|`|q8VRyCc0aa	Its a phase mate, I'm 15 and have been going through it for a while.    Best advice i can give you is keep your mind occupied and go do stuff!    And if you want a reason to live, your in this place for a reason.  because you are here you are going to make a difference, at some point in your life, by surviving you make this world a better place.    And if you still feel depressed, we don't know what is next, this might be as good as it gets!|`|5EWoZsDIaa	Because its exciting, theres always something new you havent learned yet. Ill die and therell be so much I wont see, just thinking about it motivates me for the next day.     But to be always worried about the future is not a good thing, try to focus on each day. Make plans but be prepared for the unexpected, try to keep a spirit of adventure. I also have a strog belief in God and this helps me a lot, but I know people have different beliefs, you have to try to figure out what works best for you.. hope it was of any help..|`|ZGRjOlaIaa	life is worth living because if you check out early then you'll never get to experience new things OR find answers to the big questions we all have.  The best you can do now is think positive, have good  friends and good faith (if your religious).      Sorry, this was a little vague, but it is just my take on it.|`|2VCeVVOdaa	because everyone can turn their life around... you sound like you're almost at the bottom of the pile and are desperately clinging on to what you do have, and its making you depressed. You have two options: 1. You become pro-active and move yourself up the ladder. 2. You let go of what you have, and start again. If you give up everything, you're free to do whatever you want, and cannot fear anything.|`|ZYouNFQbaa	Are you feeling depressed or are you just feeling sad?  There are a lot of symptoms to being diagnosed as depressed and the word gets used as a fashion statement a lot. Being depressed is not nice and needs dealing with in a proper way.     Only you can know whether your life is worth living or not, no one else can tell you that. We can tell you about our lives but it does not mean that the same things will happen to you and if they do, you may not have the same experience of a situation as some one else.    Think about what you want from your life, what you believe will make you happy and make your life worth living to you. Write them down, even if you think that you will never achieve them.     Do the best you can with what you have to make a happy moment for each day and remember that when things are not going as you planned. If you achieve something off your list then mark it off, and be proud that you have achieved it. It may take a very long time, allow yourself to make mistakes and to learn from them, life is not perfect not to anyone but try and remember something good to counter the bad things|`|4WhsZyS2aa	because you were put here to do something.  and thats not to be suicidal.|`|HIO0yvK0aa	tough question. there are many reasons, love?     but i find in life if your upset or angry, just think:    why am i angry why? am i depressed? in most cases it's over nothing.    addtionaly to that i look at all the good things in my life.    i think i'm in love =D my life is soo worth living, just to be with her. spend time.
8e0116579f8b9dc10ee65bb0ba1bc5a6aa	In all seriousness ...    Why assume you should be relaxed in counseling? Maybe at some level you need to be [insert word for non-relaxed here] for awhile.    Trust your body's reactions ... there's wisdom there.    Also, I'd suggest sharing your question with your therapist ... doing so could open up space for some wonderful insights.|`|6eed3c6ed1117fe6baa4febd3849d742aa	By reminding yourself that you are wisely spending your money, time and energy for a product that you desire.  You are NOT there to be admired or liked as you are, or you wouldn't be there in the first place.  But I'm definitely not saying you should be hating or flogging yourself!  Just don't waste your time being overly defensive or cautious in your effort to know yourself better.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Prepare, prepare,prepare. Make a list of things to talk about beforehand. Keep a journal of your thoughts and concerns, but remember that we are all really good at avoiding those things that bother us the most. If the therapist thinks you are just using evasion, he/she might try to steer you in other directions. Remember that the therapist is on your side, it is probably one of the most nonthreatening environments you will ever be in.     Listen and learn, accept the fact that you are there to effect change and if you fight changing or continuously go on the defensive, it is just going to take that much longer, if you can accomplish anything at all. You don't have to agree with everything the therapist tells you, but at least listen and think about it.     Also remember that you are the one who will be doing most of the work. The therapist is just a facilitator, like a rudder on a boat, helping to keep you moving in the right direction. Hope this helps. Good luck.
EgbIYBehaa	You know, i felt exactly the same, in fact i still feel like that.  But, things will get better, and what goes around comes around, cliche but true, you live and you learn, good lessons and become more knowledgeable than others, and end up having a good sense of bad people.  My ex got ran over last week.. just goes to show!

nXPJ6d7eaa	If you really want your life to get better, you can't forget these things, no matter how nasty they were. The point of adversity is to live through it so we can be stronger, better people. If you want to forget it, then you will always be the victim, and you will never really be strong enough, or learn enough, to deal with life's little surprises.    You need to meet them head on and deal with them, understand why they happened, how they happened, and then move on. It's important not to forget, or you will just end up making the same mistakes, and have a miserable life.    Good luck, honey, I think you will be fine with time and a lot of hard work. You will be a better person for it, I promise you that 
sQ3PG8Ewaa	I always feel the same way. I try to talk with my parents about it, but they just think it's normal. Or they are concerned and caring for about a minute until they all go into the living room and ignore me as if nothing ever happened. They act as if I wasn't depressed about anything, and that we were all living the perfect life, when we are not. I always feel so lost and alone. None of my friends understand me at all. I just think to myself, that I only live once, and this is the only life I will ever have, so might as well make the best of it. I listen to my favorite songs like songs by leathermouth that scream out all the anger inside and I scream along to the songs under my pillow so i don't make noise when screaming.  Just a stupid tip, haha. But I have always found it relaxing to lay down on my bed, and just listen to the things around me. So peaceful. I'm weird, but being weird makes me feel better, so dare to be weird!!|`|qSSiV0mmaa	I think you need to see a psychiatrists.  You didn't really give any specifics, so it is hard to say what you need to do to help yourself, because I'm not really sure what is wrong to begin with.  You did mention that you are bored.  I feel that way too sometimes.  But then I think of times when I am not bored because I have so much drama.  At those times I wish I could go back to being bored again. If you're bored, at least you are not going through some awful things in your life like a tragedy or a bad relationship.  If you go to a psychiatrists, you can tell them anything & they will really listen & be able to diagnose your problem & help you over come it.  I had always been really jealous & insecure.  After seeing a psychiatrist, I realized that I had more to offer then I thought.  I began going to college & am now pursuing my degree.  I have never felt so good about myself in my life. Just being able to talk to someone openly & not worrying about them judging you is such a great feeling. I think it would really help you a lot.  Good luck.

BhumxInEaa	Have you even thought about this question?    If you didn't have to think about price, which car would you choose? what sort of house would you choose?    Are these the cheapest available?    For any given product quality, the producer in a capitalist economy will try to minimize cost so as to maximize profit. But:    1. The best product is almost never the cheapest. The producer can go for high quality and higher price, low quality and lower price, or somewhere in between.    For cars, most producers have a range. But even there, the cheapest Ferrari costs more than the most expensive Honda.    2. No capitalist wants to compete. What every capitalist really wants is a monopoly. That allows sales at high prices with low costs and so very high profits.    Diamonds cost much less than their prices, because the supply is controlled by the Beers cartel.  http://mises.org/econsense/ch91.asp  Surely you've heard about how OPEC tries to keep oil prices high by cutting production.    3. For some goods, high prices are part of the attraction.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good  Give people good wine under a cheap label and they'll think it is bad.  http://www.mindtweaks.com/wordpress/?p=5...  Capitalists are no dummies, they are going to keep the prices high.|`|4Vchxp32aa	Simply put, it's because of competition.  But, because I will not receive best answer for answering it correctly, I will add a sufficient amount of information to "prove" that my answer is indeed correct.    If a business does not produce the good at the lowest cost with available technology, their cost will necessarily be higher than their competitors.  And, if this a competitive market, their competitor will be able to charge a lower price will maintaining an economic profits.  If the firm that had the higher cost exists the industry, the supply curve for the market will shift to the left an existing firm will now earn a higher profit.  So, getting lower cost raises profit in 2 ways:  1.  simply lowering cost and 2.  reducing Competition.|`|lWZi2p70aa	I wish that were true, but today it is not.  The product that you see as the "best" product is the marketing strategy.    Microsoft has convinced generations that computers are unreliable and insecure, so they can market a very badly designed operating system as virtually a monopoly.  It is in fact in their interest to keep their system insecure, so they can license knowledge of their system to anti-virus writers and can sell spyware to merchants and anti-spyware to consumers...    In an ideal capitalist system where even the largest controls about 5% of the market you find people striving for that saddle point in quality and price to get and keep customers and to increase or at least not lose their market share.      But that middle class has almost completely vanished in the US.

QfTEYT3zaa	1. The central activity is to prepare and dispense prescription medicines that have been prescribed by a doctor and to give advice on over-the-counter medicine     2. It's a combination of all three, and will also depend on if you're working in a hospital (most data and things) or in a big pharmacy (all three) or a small on (lots more working with people.     3. Pharmacists can start from $70 000 to over $90 000 after 5+ years    4. Your benefits will depend on what kind of pharmacy or organization you work for - in a hospital, for a large national chain, owning your own pharmacy     5. You'll need a degree. You could also start by training to be a pharmacy technician and then gain work experience     5. Again, it depends on where you work. In a hospital you'd have much more varied hours but in a store you'll work more regular working hours.     6. Depends on the size of the pharmacy, but generally you'd be working with others (other pharmacists or technicians, as well as the all your customers)     7. This would depend on where you work, and how senior you are. As a pharamacy technician in a local pharmacy you would probably work around 40 hours Mon-Sat in store opening times    8. There will be a bit of variance, as every customer will have different needs, mixing different drugs, understanding new drugs that are constantly coming out, offering alternatives    9. There are lots of oppurtunities for advancement, and it would depend on if you want more business responsiblity or more seniority, or to work in educating other pharmacists.

ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.

edycn5ggaa	Okay so Opportunity Cost is defined as the cost that you take on by choosing a certain decision.     So this person can do the following:    In the time it takes for the person to make three statements, that person could answer 12 phone calls.    In the time it takes the person to answer 12 phone calls, that person can make three statements.    The opportunity cost of a financial statement is the following:    Let x = financial statement  Let y = phone call    The coefficient defines the number of units.    3x = 12y  x=4y  So the opportunity cost of one financial statement is 4 phone calls.    The opportunity of a phone call is as following:    12y = 3x  y=3/12x  y=1/4x    The opportunity cost of a phone call is 1/4 of a financial statement.|`|cHaRg3fkaa	The opportunity cost for something is how much you forsake with respect to an alternative.  In this case you have two possibilities - produce financial statements or answer phone calls.  In producing one financial statement you forsake four phone calls.  If you take a phone call, you forsake producing 1/4 of a financial statement.  To learn more about this, as well as other intro economics, get a good 1st year text like one written (edited) by Lipsey.|`|4Vchxp32aa	the opportunity cost of a financial statement is 4 phone calls  the opportunity cost of a phone is 1/4 of financial statement
AA11312040	Real world examples prove this theory everyday. At its crux is the idea that given a series of inputs and variables there is a point where the "ideal" cost-output ratio is met. Changing any of these variables increases costs or decreases output, both of which lower your overall efficiency.     A graphical way to look at it would be to envision a triangle, where points A, B, and C represent labor, costs and time. At their most optimum point, represented by an equilateral (all 3 sides equal) triangle your inputs are all in check, and max efficiency is realized.     If you decrease time available, thus making it an isosceles triangle from a visual perspective you will need to increase labor and money to bring it back into equilibrium.     However, because these increases did not lead to any additional output, just the originally planned output at a dramatically higher cost your returns are actually diminished.
1d144c3a5d03c47f15784117493133c8aa	First draw your graph, secondly label one axis painting,and the other one sanding. Now number each axis 1-10. Draw a line from point 8 on the sanding axis to point 6 on painting axis. This is your PPF (possible production function), it shows you all the possible combinations of painting and sanding in 24 hours. While looking at your graph you can see that if you sand 2 floors you will only be able to paint 4.5 rooms. Because opportunity cost is what you gave up to do the task you can see that your opportunity cost is painting 1.5 rooms. I took the assumption that you can paint half a room, if you are unable to use fractions your opportunity cost will be 2 rooms. Hope this helps!!!

LbbawO7naa	The way you can "force" yourself into lucid dreaming is by making yourself aware that you are NOT awake. You can do this by drawing an A on the palm of your hand (for awake) get into the habit of staring at your hand before you go to bed, and when you awake from your sleeping. The goal is to get yourself to look at your hands in your dream... In your dream there will be no A on your palm, automatically triggering the awareness that you are in fact, dreaming. Now when you are awake when ever you spot the "A" push your finger into your palm. If you do this in a dream it will feel like mush, with no resistance.   If this doesnt make much sense here is some website links  http://dreamsymbols.net/articles/1.htm  http://www.dreamweb.ch/don/  http://www.web-us.com/lucid/luciddreamin...|`|DAXgxxp3aa	tell yourself to dream about it  think about it alot.|`|pk9mwqYpaa	http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0oGkwfGxodJO3...|`|fNctrQ4Haa	You have to think about it till 7 am too 7 pm (or which ever time you wake up in the morning but remember it has to last till 7 pm) Its kinda hard to keep thinking about it because we get easily distracted so yeah but if you wanna lucid dream then you should do it without giving up. Hard huh? Yep. But that's how god made it be. And do not hate god for doing this. He created the world so, you should be happy with what you have in your hands.|`|mU2eMSi3aa	Keep a log of all your dreams.  Try thinking of a dream that you want to have as you go to sleep.  These things will make you more aware of your dreams and allow you to start lucid dreaming.

zC7pkdK1aa	It is likely that oil prices will not grow to how they were last summer for a couple of years.   The growth is due many investors purchasing large amounts of oil for investments. The reason why it started growing from 2000 is that many then were already aware of the profitable investment of oil. Low prices now are due to many investors now SELLING their oil for lucrutive profits. With a greater supply of oil and the same demand, there was a surplus of oil, thus causing the large price fall.    To an economic point of view lower fuel prices usually symbolize more recession and thus less economic activity.     For the average American, it will just lower your automobile budget.

0n04tIJ6aa	Humor is a definite ice breaker. If you can derive the initiative to make someone feel comfortable with humor, even when it's aimed at yourself it shows that you can also be comfortable with who you are. People gravitate toward that, a smile can be contagious. Who wants to be around someone so serious and intense all the time.  Friendships evolve, just use some tact in order to nurture it. Don't facilitate expectations of what you want that friendship to be, it will come naturally.    Cheers ;)|`|U4V6TkZEaa	According to a university study, women are more attracted sexually to funny guys.

a7gdFHhraa	It's the systems fault, not a product. The credit system loaning a person money via credit then judging their worth by a number system is the first flaw. A poor infastructure due to low internal spending leads to poor road systems, water/waste facilities and public school quality. Greed from companys not wanting to pay American wages send work over seas to get away with cheap labor robs us of our jobs and we lose our ability to pay back our debt and circulate money back into the system. During all this people who are above the "rat race" with higher income or statue grow rich off of our turmoil and labor. It goes to a certain point then the economy exhaust itself, saturated with product and material that cannot be supported or bought by we the people. So you have millions of new cars sitting on the car lot not moving because the average persons income is less than 20k a year and the price tag says 45k, nobody in an economical pinch can possibly go that far out on a limb and since there is no purchasing the car manufacturer takes a blow then ask for a hand out from the government despite the fact if we were to get a handout we might be able to buy the vehicle and inturn help not only ourselves but the auto industry. The problem lies in pure ignorance, the people who run the county come from millionare households and do not know what it is like to be a common person living on minimum wage, since there is a HUGE gap in interest and understanding we'll never see a better place for you and me, just for them.|`|Z2WeMbWFaa	The financial crisis, has very little to do with spike in oil price in 2008. The cause of the financial crisis will lies some longer back. It was caused by a bubble in housing prices which had been started already back in 2003. The bubble was in turn created by too easy access to mortgage loans, a low interest rate and lack of proper oversight. A collapse was bound to happen sooner or later, it was just a coincidence that it happened just after seeing the highest oil prices ever.|`|hdnI8ARiaa	I don't think so. jobs tied to sales are always susceptible to slow times.  so are high paid jobs like masons. no one can afford to pay 38 dollars an hour for 52 weeks a year.

wY3vrxTbaa	It will make him see, but chances are it will make him mad. He might pull the, "If you don't like it, why do it back to me" thing. Your best chance is to just tell him honestly how you feel, and if he doesn't care or gets angry at you for saying how you feel, tell him you need to spend some time apart from him. Maybe that will make him realize what he could lose.   Yes, I believe in reverse psychology. But reverse psychology isn't treating someone just as badly as they treat you. It's just saying things that make them think for themselves that what they are doing is stupid.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I'm not sure exactly what you mean by him acting really careless, but I'm not sure that, that is reverse psychology. But, I don't think that it will work on him unless maybe if he starts paying more attention. You're right when you said that it could make things worse. Some people don't see the big picture. My ex husband used to do things like just not answer you if you asked him something and he was watching a tv show or w/e. That used to make me so mad. He would also do things like just leave his clothes on the living room floor, or wherever and expected me to pick them up because he worked all day, stuff like that. I have no idea if that is anything like what you're going through, but the circumstances really don't matter. I knew that he wasn't smart enough to catch on to what I was doing, so I pointed it out to him.  I told him that if he could be that way to me, that I was going to do him the same way for a week and see if he could understand how he makes me feel. I did it and it actually sunk in somewhat. In other words, I told him that he was about to be shown something or he never would have gotten it and things would have probably been worse.|`|wS6U3DbKaa	Yup|`|Y6TDCkaYaa	yeah i believe it because i use it all the time|`|wnbz5gNzaa	Yes, go to couple counseling|`|AA11009322	In some cases reverse psychology works.

Is she just supposed to let you do whatever you want and not get you back?    Maybe this will be a lesson to you not to try to take advantage of someone and show off.  The ladies weren't being unkind or cruel to you, your mom and the other woman were just acknowledging how you got what you had coming to you.  I'm sorry but this is how it is.

She grabbed your balls. Yeah, it hurt. But you're the one who didn't want to go easy. If you don't want to go easy on her, she shouldn't go easy on you. and obviously you should have listened to her when she said take it easy, but YOU couldn't handle it. And she gave you a ride home, which seems nice, to me.    What'd we learn from this story?   -Not all women are unkind.   -You, however, don't seem kind.   -If a women asks you politley for something, be a frigging gentleman and give it to her.  -Don't dish out what you can't take  -Learn better english.|`|AA12196812	Are you joking?|`|zJEvYQuOaa	learn more english, i bet you are an immigrant.|`|AOBEkqzXaa	because we can :) Until you learn to birth babies deal with it.

She's an Adult and should know better.  What she did Is Illegal and considered both child abuse and possibley sexual abbuse.    Your mom should also be locked up for not taking parenting seriously.     It's bitches like them that give women a bad reputation.    As for the child birth comment some one left LMFAO,   Try passing a kidney stone, then talk to me about pain.    BTW it can take days to pass a stone.    And yes passing a kidney stone is worse than childbirth ask Any woman that's experienced both.   Women are designed for giving birth, no one is designed to pass a kidney stone.

HimBbU6caa	I hate to sound short but you need to move on. We all have a tendency to fantasize about possibilities and hypothetical scenarios with crushes. These feelings can become counterproductive when we allow them to dominate us. They begin to affect our well being. You need to understand that this crush is just that...a crush. Nothing more.    I can say that the older you get the effects of crushes is lessened. Older people tend to see things in a more realistic light. At 19 you are not at that point yet trust me.    Edit: That May/December thing is not good for you either. A man like that would run circles around you. He probably knows this and is honorable enough to keep you at arms distance. Maybe he is baiting you. Whatever the reason you need to play in your own league. I have to keep it real.

Ask a stranger for money.  go to restaurant, pay with pennies  eat with your hands  wear clothes backwards, guys could wear girls garments, wear shoes on wrong feet, don't shower, girls shave legs in public bathroom  farting, picking your nose, scratching body parts, same sex holding hands  cutting in line at bank  take groceries from other peoples shopping carts  saying hello, genuine manners  go to coffee shop and sit down with random people and talk to them about your health or sex life or do this in an office, act like you belong there and you know the people  stand while eating in a restaurant, or eat on floor  walk around the mall with an open umbrella  wear a sombrero  have a pic nic in the middle of the classroom|`|LddkW0JFaa	Go up to random people and ask, "Hey, do you have any pot?" (coke, heroin, meth, etc.)  Start praying really loud and vocally in or near a busy area.  Ask someone you don't know a very personal question. Tell her/him a ton of personal details as background info.  Go to a fast food restaurant at a busy time and ask for something that's not on the menu (something that they would be unable to prepare). When the clerk says they don't have it, ask to speak to the manager.  Go to a book store and ask somebody for books about the superiority of your ethnicity. Go on and on about how superior your ethnicity is.|`|2aRv8GPMaa	Well, since your project/paper is due tomorrow you're going to have to fabricate a story (this completely avoiding any real embarasment in public). I had this same assignment last year and I actually went to a familily dining restaurant and ate dinner with an imaginary friend. It was, needless to say, interesting. I ordered him food and got a box to go and everything. Another person in the class went to a nearly empty fast food restaurant and sat down to eat right next to the only person sitting in the dining room. You could also say you covered up and attempted to take a nap on a display bed at a department store, as this isn't breaking the store's rules... Only violating a social norm. Eat under the table at a restaurant. Talk extemely loud or extremely quiet to store personell. Use the bathroom with the stall open. Ask a stranger pervasive questions. Make strange facial expressions while using a normal voice with someone. The possibilities are endless...
qfe5vHbeaa	In regards to you calm demeanor, and I realize you aren't asking the validity of any psychopathy you may have, but for examples sake i shall use this. Psychopaths can often appear calm, seem at peace, and unshakable, but they never are. And I am entirely sure a calm demeanor can exist without an elitist set of mind. And i do not think having a calm demeanor necessarily gives one an elitist attitude. True, as would the flow of logic travels, these both COULD be independent entirely, as to say you might just happen to have both. But your calm attitude seems to me to be a case of detachment. It is somewhat similar to Police who spend a large portion of their life in turmoil. Your environment that you grew up in was one in which you are evidently the most intelligent. And you seem to have morals different entirely than those which you parents tried to instill. I congratulate you on that, truely, not many can so easily subdue subconscious instinct. Ah, silly me i seemed to have diverted form the question. Answer: no, you are both calm and an elitist. It is not a coincidence, but neither cause the other, they are simply a product of your upbringing.   Cheers, Your on the road to understanding the truth, but, as you may already suspect, no one really wants to know the truth.|`|4Zbjx8bCaa	Yes you are a psychopath and it's only because your family is equally as messed up and watches your every action.|`|LddkW0JFaa	Since you believe yourself to be intellectually superior to me I wonder if I'm wasting my time answering you. They might think you're a psycho. Just try to express your nerves more (in your vocal tone). A lot of teens your age think that they know everything. So if they talk to people about your attitude, people will tell them that it's normal. The main clue that someone's a psychopath is not just their belief that they're superior but they tend to be manipulative and they have bad tempers. So try to show respect and don't get angry.    By the way, I love the way you write. You should become a writer.|`|pAwdlwYZaa	interesting.. No you are not a psychopath. Depicting by the way you type, you seem introversive which is quite normal, though depending on your age, alot of adolescent teens feel that way. Be yourself screw everyone else.
TkCIUNxdaa	You are holding something back from someone important in your life.  The ants symbolize the secret trying to get out... you pinching the bumps is your desire to let the truth out.

You are feeling neglected and insignificant. Petty things will annoy you throughout the following day. You need to be more cooperative as this will be the only way to achieve your desires. The dream may also be a metaphor on feeling antsy or restless or it can be a pun on your "aunt".     Ants also symbolize hard work, diligence and industry. Increase business activities are expected. On a less positive note, ants symbolize social conformity and mass action. In this regard, you may feel that your life is too structured and orderly.     According to the biblical interpretations, ants symbolize diligence concerning the things of God. Despite its small size, the ant lays up substance during times of plenty. (Prov 30:25)      Pimples   To dream that you have pimples, relates to issues about your self-esteem and self-image. You are feeling awkward or out of place in some situation or relationship.     To dream that you are popping your pimples, indicates that negative emotions about need to be expressed and acknowledge. Those emotions that you are holding back are on the verge of erupting.|`|d0Pl5JOaaa	NIGHTMARE! You might have been pinching yourself during the dream.|`|8ZoSSslFaa	something is deeply bothering you even if you don't know what it is yet.|`|xri2lFpKaa	ahhhhhh i had a dream similar but rice was coming out of my neck when i pinched it!@! i think it means we  need to clean up our diets or something!@! haha idk!|`|c68XWGltaa	has your daddy ever touched you before?|`|QJuTpHL1aa	Your dream is just your subconscious mind tricking you into thinking it really means something. You were half asleep and your half-conscious mind tried to make sense of it. I think your dream is meaningless, but it makes for some interesting drama in a horror movie. Write it down and maybe someday you can write a story from it!|`|FF9mMlgKaa	it means you were actually pinching yourself which is not uncommon to actually do something you experience in a dream.|`|RPLaXU42aa	You obviously did it while you were dreaming.    Might be nervous about something or worried.|`|2BoEjhA3aa	your probably gonna have chicken pocks or gonna have ant bites every where.|`|sZXMJmQMaa	Dreams don't need to mean anything, but you probably pinched yourself in your sleep in response to your dream ...(must have been realistic).    Dreams can be triggered by so many feelings that it is hard to say. In this case I haven't a clue.    You might want to be a nice person! lol  (Freddy isn't real)|`|oTHGgowsaa	Could mean you have insecurities about your body, projected in the subconscious as say, a lack of trust the mind has for the body.|`|4W8fHj5Gaa	you were itchy|`|WhlwZeiXaa	someone was pinching you in your sleep!|`|IxGa7mnGaa	you may have a dark secret that you need to reveal, or you need to take a shower|`|dHP0eJVBaa	Ants  To see ants in your dream, signify your general dissatisfaction in your daily life.

Unless you share a room, then the feeling of being pinched if someone was playing a joke could have triggered the ant dream. But if you sleep alone, it was yourself.    You're probably just stressed out or have high anxiety.  I gotta say, though, the ants coming out of your body is really freakin' creepy. I've had scary dreams with bugs like that too. I think it was because my house was getting really dirty, and I was finding a lot of bugs, and I just felt filthy. You should take a shower or clean your room or pick all the blackhead of your face with a bobby pin, lol.  But right when you wake up, just rinse off your face and go have a glass of water. It helps me.|`|9Z48RhlKaa	That is creeeeepy!!!!   Maybe something about like a secret wants out but it needs help?|`|kep1iGHpaa	It means your crazy.  Get help.|`|9z9BW10daa	I think it means that you feel as though you lack the control that you wish to have in various situations or that when you try to take control of a situation, it gets worse or doesn't get any better as you tried pinching the "problems" and it obviously got worse.    Hope that helped!  :)
3p6wp7DYaa	I have noticed a slight increase in the price of gas in my area. Unfortunately, the price of gas is determined by supply and demand factors, not by how good or how bad the economy is. For example, if OPEC decides that the price is too low and decides to curb production to a level that is short of demand, the result will be an increase in the price we pay at the pump regardless of the state of the economy. You also have to keep in mind that gas consumption is not all that elastic. You can start saving gas by carpooling and combining shopping trips, but how much of the national consumption can be eliminated? After a certain percentage of adjustment to make up for higher prices, the consumption of gasoline is fairly fixed, making the prices more likely to keep rising if supply is limited.|`|R1LvhhTeaa	Are gas prices rising - I haven't seen that.|`|l0oDymHYaa	You are not following the News. The gas prices are going south|`|zC7pkdK1aa	The AAA average gas price fell to $1.90 in November 2008.
6H1ie8WXaa	Personally, I like her as a person, but yes, she can be biased in her beliefs.|`|z60J0Z9Daa	Haha there is even a website about her...  http://www.stopdrlaura.com/laura/    Isnt she the one who's son went crazy...  "21-year-old, Afghanistan-based soldier son  whose MySpace page supposedly had cartoon images of rape, murder, torture, child molestation, and more"  http://www.independent.com/news/2007/may...  I dont think she is "for" men either....certainly screwed her kid up.|`|jf1f7vNxaa	Dr. Laura is one of the VERY FEW people calling women on THEIR behavior.    Face it, sister, you're just too used to getting everything your way.  Along comes Dr. Laura smacking you in the face with a daily dose of reality, and you're shocked.    The fact is that she DOES in fact call men on their behavior, but it is MOSTLY women calling in, and most of the time, they're seeking affirmation of their irrational attitudes, which Dr. Laura does not provide.  Sh!t - even after Dr. Laura gives sound advice, half the women refuse to listen to it.    Now I ask you - have you ever listened to the show, or are YOU running YOUR mouth.|`|tTIXhe7daa	Who is that|`|un0C52G8aa	She is a hypocrite of the worst kind. She belittles working mothers but holds a job herself. She started out as a radical feminist and even underwent a tubal ligation to keep from getting pregnant (she later had it reversed). She posed for nude photos. She also broke up a marriage. She became estranged from her family. She eventually made peace with her father but totally froze her mother and younger sister out of her life. In 2002, her mother was found dead in her Beverly Hills condominium. It was estimated that she had been dead for more than two months by the time her remains were found. The two hadn't spoken since the 1980s. She has never been friendly with her sister. So much for family values, huh?|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Dr. Laura is a loudmouthed narcissistic jerk who is all about self-promotion and will get ahead by any means possible...even if it means selling out her sisters and maligning them.  She is the Queen "B" of all of the Queen Bees!|`|YQOT68xFaa	Not at all! I listened to Dr Laura for years. I heard her give men the exact same advice she gave women: suck it up, work on your marriage, "be the change you want to see happen". She does not hate women. She wants to help people. And I never once heard her blame a woman for a man's inappropriate behaviour and say it was all her fault and let the man off the hook.    I think people don't like her because she is traditional, she calls herself a "recovered feminist (statiing that her feminist ways/views nearly ruined her marriage), she encourages women to stay home with their children when they're small, she is against abortion (referring to it as "sucking a baby into a sink", which is what it is!), and she's big on things like personal responsibility and sacrifice and compromise. People hate that because it means you can't focus on yourself 24/7 and can't get away with everything.      RoVale - all that trouble with her family could also give her the ability to teach others how *not* to do things.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Yeah, I've seen that in quite a lot of her writing. Obviously she thinks men can't take care of themselves.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	Damned agent of patriarchal oppression!    Edit: Hmm.. I'm not doing well tonight.|`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	No, she is against stupidity and the victim mindset.  She is pro personal responsibility and integrity.  She believes in earning what you have and not riding someone else's coattails to get where you are in life.
zZY3JX30aa	You can rationalize all you want and make all the excuses you want, what it comes down to basically, is that you don;t want to be responsible for your life. It was much easier before when you had someone you could blame for whatever came along, since they were making most of your decisions for you. Now that you're a big girl, Janet, and your life has become your responsibility, the world looks a lot different and you have to do the work. Welcome to life.    I don't condone or encourage the act, but it's your life, your choice and your business.|`|nyylb6qUaa	Buddy, I have nobody in this world either. I have no friends, no family, and I am all by myself. I know it is hard, but try to stay alive. Cast your cares on me if you want. My e-mail is themark08@yahoo.com, please e-mail me. I know and understand why you feel this way. Nobody cares, or pays you any attention, and a lot of people just don't care, but you always have a friend in me. E-mail me, and I can try too help you out.

It is YOUR life after all.    But have you considered that maybe you're just going through a tough phase in your life. Everyone feels a little down now and again, but if it's recurring and lasting long periods of time, maybe you should go on an antidepressant if you're not willing to receive professional help.    As you said, you're only 17. You have your whole life ahead of you, and trust me, it gets better.    Good luck :)|`|fN3dsHERaa	Before you commit to suicide, live some more...   by live I mean, try new things, hell go to some country you've wanted to go to... if you don't see the point in living anymore-do something you used to dream about doing (because if you don't see the point in living, why not?).   Don't be too rash- if you want to die...you have time... death isn't going anywhere... so I suggest you first make a list of some cool things, places, aspirations, etc. (ex.):  - sky diving  - make a youtube video of me singing  - go to Argentina  - go to everywhere this guy went: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNF_P281U...  -get a pilot's license  - go to alaska  - road trip across the usa- picture by every state sign    then set a date for your suicide like a year and a half from now. (that's a really short time if you compare it to the time others get... so it's only like a few minutes)-but you HAVE to give your list a shot and can't think about how horrible life is. You can't move your date once you've made it, okay?   So now that you've set it for that time, you have to do everything on that list and give Life just one more shot.     If by that date you set, you still want to commit suicide,  make sure you've made videos for loved ones, a will and take care of the little details before just going, okay?     Good luck, I hope you find your reason for living, but if not, just give yourself that year and a half to do whatever (because it's not like you get another life)|`|xEI2sXKMaa	if you're going to kill yourself.    take one extra step. save up money for a bit. and travel,  i bet you after you have traveled (really traveled not a plane ticket here and back) you will have a new outlook.    take busses, a car, ride a bike through states, hitchhike, hike, trainhop, go to music shows in random towns with door fee's, go to coffee shops and meet characters!|`|a64l1dXLaa	No! Please don't. You have a future and you'll never see it if you don't live. What if you were meant to have kids? They'll never be alive. What if you were meant to meet your soul mate? You never would.|`|KKh8rikGaa	No, it is NOT ok to kill yourself,there is so many things you could be doing to help yourself and others, why don't you teach someone how to read/write, type, volunteer to help someone who can't help them self, and have you tried c h u r c h,  you might be surprised
d43dfc861b03b2e066622388398733b3aa	A person's attitude toward his name is a gauge of self-esteem, says psychologist Ron Taffel, author of Nurturing Good Children Now. "If self-esteem is low, even a David or Jenny could hate their nameas a reflection of how they feel about themselves."    You have said that you hate your name Williams. Or you don't feel like a Williams. You did not choose your name- so I would change it legally.  Go back to the Spanish relative- find a name you want and see a lawyer.      Proper names are poetry in the raw, said the bard W.H. Auden. "Like all poetry, they are untranslatable."     Mapping your name onto yourself is a tricky procedure indeed. We exist wholly independently of our names, yet they alone represent us on our birth certificates and gravestones.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	CHANGE IT WHEN YOY GET OLDER.
w4mPekKbaa	Your doing whats right for you and I applaud you for that. Of course no one else will care because of the love in their heart (not saying that they are hateful people, its that they cant allow much more room for love or feeling inside their heart)    I think you should try to get the cat to the vet, and see about the Humane Society and the other cat is just doing what cats do with other animals come into the picture, so stay true to yourself and do what makes you walk away HAPPY...    Hope it all works out for you.|`|0OTuWHhpaa	If you kittens don't get on neither will ever be happy.

You've done the right thing so far!  We all need to have compassion for those of us less fortunate than ourselves!  It is not in the least bit selfish!  Since it sounds like you've done all you can for this poor baby, maybe it is time to take him/her to the humane society or a shelter.  Please try to find help for this poor kitten - do not abandon him/her at this point.  Kudos to you for doing the right thing!|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i would take it to a shelter where they can care for it and get all the vets bills and things done  my dog came from a rescue shelter, some of them are nice  they would be willing to care for the kitten and would obviously get it medical attention
EsllB60Haa	Hey   All that you? Heres some sympathy!  Usually you either get put on some medication for depression ect, whic would probs be the main cause of most of the other problems (except stress which may cause the depression), and/or get hooked up with and NHS couselling/phschiatry service.  And if you ever feel like talking to someone impartial but experienced in such matters, email me at joey_hopelessromantic@hotmail.co.uk. I may only be year 10 but I'm aufully mature, and I'd like to help.  Hope that helped and look forward to possibly hearing from you!  Joey
HBoCDR0Maa	all you need to do is ask yourself this: do you like stuff? because you need money to buy stuff. to get money you need a job. to get a job that pays more than just rent and utilities you have to go to college. at least a community college. tell your doctor to switch your medicine because it is making you drowsy.  honsetly, it's almost impossible to get a job without a high school degree... i know from experience. tell your teachers that you are having trouble and they will probably be glad to help you out a little. I know sometimes teachers act like you're the worst thing that ever happened to them... but they really are there to help you.    oh and get a hobby or something, that should help your motivation.
wwdllMzYaa	well, im sorry things are bad for you at the mo  but you know that your depression could be making it 99 times worse than it is  maybe its not totally gone yet    if things you enjoy doesnt make you feel good, then it does sound liek your still in a depression    maybe you are not seeing all the details  ie why she dumped you  why your friends are busy, why you think your internet friends dont talk to you    life is c**p, you hve to try to make it better, by yourself, doing things you enjoy, things that make it a bit better  try soem new things, things you havent tried before    are you on medication for your depression?  if not, you need to go to the doctors and talk to them about it  if so, then maybe you need them changed, or give it more time to get used to them, they take time to work
