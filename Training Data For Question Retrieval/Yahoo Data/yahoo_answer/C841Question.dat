Look at what happens, aig is bailed out with 150 billion dollars and decides to give 100's of millions of dollars to its employees.  The fundamentals of our system have to change and I say go to you no where big business.  Big business doesn't care about anyone.  If we all go bankrupt, this will force prices to come down and wipe out debts of a lot of people.  It will force everything to reset.  Might cost lots of jobs and confidence, but that is happening anyway.  I say sc**w you to the world financial systems.

20090202172543AAzdbok	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can you qualify for the first time home buyer's credit if you're a cash buyer?	I have been in the process for awhile buying a house on short sale.  It's taken a long time, but as far as I understand it's going to go through.  Several months ago, I unexpectedly received a large inheritance.  I was already pre-approved for financing but because of the mortgage rate being higher than any secure return, I added an addendum to make the property a cash sale.      I still fit within the income guidelines... but I'm unsure if getting the inheritance and paying for the house in full will disqualify me from being eligible for the grant.      I appreciate any and all help - links to sites with information would be incredible helpful as well.  When I research it myself I tend to get lost in a sea of garbage sites.    And p.s. .... I know that this "credit" needs to be paid back.  But at 0% interest... it's helpful to have a little extra to put toward repairs/renovations.    Thanks again!

The collections guys said even though I pay my half, and your x wife is the custodial parent, that if the full amount isnt paid it still goes on my credit report.  Is this right?      I do my part and pay my child support and pay my half of the out of pocket medical bills and it still goes on my credit report.  I WANT TO CRY.  and my current wife will probably want to kill me.  this isnt right.      oh and by the way, i have provided my daughter with medical insurance her whole life, my x has done NOTHING.

My father is the one actually purchasing the duplex (I dont have enough money or risk tolerance to buy it) and I was wondering what kind of rate he should expect to get if I live there.  Will it be about the same as a home mortgage or higher (if so how much higher?)?
20090202175313AAQuijQ	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is there anythin I can do about the creepy guys my renter brings to my home?	I own a home and rent out two of the bedrooms (I live there as well.) I know both the girls. Problem is, one of them is always meeting guys on the internet and bringing them over, sometimes they spend the night. Some of them are completely creepy, and I have nice things and don't want them in my home. Not to mention some of them look like serial killers. I know this sounds horribly judgemental, but I am unnerved by her bringing in random guys she meets online to my home for their first meeting.       Legally, is there anything I can do?

I've been playing with online house affordability calculators like this one:       http://finance.yahoo.com/calculator/real...       Why do these calculators ask you to enter "Estimated annual property taxes" and "Estimated annual homeowner's insurance?"      Isn't your annual property tax going to be BASED ON how much home I can afford?  How am I supposed to know the amount of the taxes when I don't know the value of the property?  Isn't this putting the cart before the horse?  This would make a little more sense to me if they asked for a percentage.      Ditto, for the insurance.  Isn't insurance also based upon the value to be insured?      I'm probably misunderstanding these terms, but these calculators usually have really lousy instructions.      Thanks!

20090202180923AA8nIBt	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How to get approved on a rental application with my fiance with bad credit and low income due to illness?	I have a tricky situation.    I have been renting for about 2 years from the same property management. Only paid my rent late 1 time and it was only 1 day late. I have pretty good credit, but not the longest credit history, maybe 4 years.   Anyway, this coming summer I am planning on renting an apartment, house, cottage, duplex, or something similar with my fiance. I probably would be approved no problem as the only applicant. The problem is that my fiance has horrible credit and very little income because he has contracted a debilitating illness that only leaves him exhausted after an hour of light work (like an office job, not anything very physical). His parents would very likely cosign for him, but I am wondering if there is any way for me to be the only applicant and just have him on the lease so we don't have to be sneaky about him living there? It is seems like the situation would be similar to a parent applicant with a child on the lease as a resident but a non-contributor to the rent... but I don't know how it works. Any advice? A landlord's advice would be much appreciated. Thanks.

While trying to do a good deed, she was then rear ended by what she believes was an intoxicated driver because they hit and ran. Now her 2007 Chevy Cobalt LT Coupe that she was leasing is now totaled and the insurance company isn't paying her a dime. She was almost at the end of her lease. She and her friend suffered from whip lash and are extremely sore. They've closed her case and aren't trying to pursue her hit and run driver. She did give a description of the vehicle that hit her but isn't the insurance company suppose to give her what she's already paid on her vehicle instead of making her pay her deductible and closing her case? Now she's out of a car and it clearly wasn't her fault.

20090202181123AAYmvcm	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can I sue both the sellers and buyers agent under Texas law?	I just closed on a sale of my home this morning.  At the first of the month the buyers agent took the buyer to look at my house while I was out of town (they used the lockbox on the front door to gain access).  I drove by the house at 10pm one night (the house was vacant but still had my belongings in it) upon my return to town, to notice every light in the house on and the curtains wide open.  Starting to get angry, I entered the house to shut the curtains and turn off the lights, when I realized that every door in the house was unlocked (except the front door) and the gate to the back yard was unlocked.      The next day I looked online to see when the last time someone was in the house, and it was 5 days prior.  Therefore, the house was left open in that state for 5 days!!!  I told my realtor (sellers realtor) about the incident and that I wanted to file a formal complaint and I needed him to provide the buyers realtor the information necessary and the buyers realtor's license number.  He said he would provide it, but never did although we kept asking.  This morning at closing we requested this information again, and our realtor stated that he "didn't want to say anything to the realtor before the sale went through because he didn't want to jeopardize the sale" (as if he was acting in our interest).      I am thinking about sueing the buyers agent for neglagence to get our commission we paid back from her, and possibly our realtor for not acting as our agent and in our best interest.  (He also didnt present our case to the buyer for our counteroffer, and eventually we sold the house for less than market. I feel this was because to him the $2k difference was only $60 in commission, and he wanted the sale to go through so he would make something instead of nothing.)      Do I have a valid claim against either one of the realtors for recovery of the commission I have paid these people?  I am a CPA, which is a true profession, and realtors call themselves professionals?!  If I left my client's records laying out on a table in a busy restaurant at lunch with their social security number on it, they could sue me for negligence.  Surely I can do something about this whole situation...      Please advise...

I worked for a medical insurance company early 2008 as an Independent Sales Contractor.  After all was said and done, I made $4,000 all of which was untaxed.  Because this was my first time and I failed to think about it or look it up, I never kept any receipts for anything so I can only estimate how much money I spent to drive to clients homes, make copies, etc.  I am currently working on my taxes with my husband and am not sure how to file the income I made or how to pay the taxes on it.  If I file joint income taxes with my husband based on our wages through being employed, will they just take the taxes I owe from my self-employment income when I attach the schedule C to it or will I have to pay that separately?  And how do I calculate how much I owe?  I read that 15.3% of my income is owed to SS and Medicare, so do I take that out of the $4,000 plus other taxes owed?  Help!  TIA!

20090202183138AAaIFwS	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	My Boss is not reporting all my income on my W2?	I got my w2, it was 10000 short of what i thought i made, i told my boss and he said he would look into it. Today he  informed me that he forgot to call in a few checks to payroll so it never got reported that he payed me. He said if he reports it its gonna cost him money to pay my taxes and that he doesnt have it. He said hes already being audited for 2007 and doesnt want them to look into things again this year. So in the end he told me to forget about it and i would get more back if it looks like i made less which is not right because if he reported the 10000 i would have like 2000 more payed into taxes and would still get about the same even in a higher tax bracket i already did the math. I want myincome to show the full amount because im looking into getting a homeloan and think that it would look better if my income was higher what can i do????

Up until recently, I have always payed my credit cards off in full every month.  With the troubled economy, this might be the first time that I might not be able to pay my balance off in full, and I was wondering if this would negatively affect my credit score?

Thoughts?  Thanks!
20090202183706AAWFwLy	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Is the American Express Platinum card worth it?	Is the American Express Platinum card really worth it? Is it much better than Preferred Rewards Gold Card?      I've joined American Express 7 months ago & have been more-the-less happy. Although I don't have 100,000 points like I do on my VISA (yet), I see good rewards in the catalog & like their perks. I was upset when flying recently to find out that Preferred Gold wasn't good enough for the First Class lounges.    So, knowing me, I couldn't stop myself from upgrading my card to Platinum. It just sounds so much better; 24/7 Concierge, 4X Points for Shopping @ certain stores (whereas Gold was only 2-3 X points) and basically all perks they can offer.      I want to ask someone who has an AMEX Platinum Card - how can you weigh it's worth? It sounds great, but for $450 annually vs. $150 for Gold (plus first year would have been free for Gold). Am I totally out of my mind?       Furthermore, I also ordered a card for my wife, not realizing they charge $175 on top of the $450 for up to 3 extra Platinum cards. I called their customer service & explained that this wasn't clearly explained online where I upgraded. They're willing to bump her back to  Preferred Gold.       Should I:   1) Keep Platinum for both of us.   2) Keep Platinum for myself & Preferred Gold for her (meaning, she can enjoy the Platinum benefits from my card as well or we actually each need one).   3) Downgrade them both back to Preferred Gold Premium?      Is there any way around the Platinum $450 fee? At least for one year to see how it is?? For now, I'll start checking out what's different. But I can't seem to find a very precise & clear list explaining what each do & don't have.      Thanks for your help in advance.

They own a duplex- we each live in our own separate compartment. We pay all the household expenses, such as the mortgage, water, property and other necessities such as food and utility bills.  We each have and pay our own utility bill. That would be the only "housing" expense besides insurance that they pay. We have two children. According to the IRS, one of us can claim Head of Household and we can claim his parents as our dependents.  However, they were unable to tell me if claiming them will affect their social security benefits.  Will it?

20090202123352AAMp2jv	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	If career as musician is really hard to make money, then why so many people still want to be a musician?	I've just talked with a friend of mine, he had just started to pursue a Solo carer , because he loves music very much, just like me, but unfortunately, and rather sadly, just this afternoon, he poured all his heart that , as I quoted from him, "being musician in indonesia is just f*ckin hard & doesn't make sense! it's just so dirty often, and hard to get recognized, and with piracy running rampant, greedy labels, very low purchasing-power from still-poor people in the mainstream, etc etc"  , and he's even thinking of just concentrating in the business-aspect , not the artistic-side anymore in the music "industry". He's planning to just start a label & draw new artists,....instead of following his TRUE passion to become a full-time musician!      so then, i start asking myself this: if career as musician is really hard to make money, then why so many people still want to be a musician ??   why? what do you think?   do you think these people (musicians) are probably just 'naive' people who don't know that it's a cruel cruel world in a music, no, actually, music-business world.  'cuz often there're more to it than only making good & creative tunes.  this i've unfortunately & pitifully learned at least in my corrupt country, Indonesia, where sadly, music is just another corrupt tool. and that's why no wonder a lot of musicians/bands are just poor, & even some really great/talented ones is lacking so much appreciations from mainstream people, instead, many people generally only prefer for 'stupid' songs/music as long with good looks, and many other artificial/fake things!   and i'm sure the situation is no different even in advanced countries like U.S, Europe, Japan, etc.  many people are just plain stupid, don't understand 'good music' from 'bad music' , and most big-players in the so-called "music-business" are all crooked and greedy, all they think is only money, not enhancing/supporting their artists/bands!!      with all of these sad things above, i've recently often wondered & kept wondering, is there still any point for any person, no matter how talented or even multi-talented or passionate he/she is at music, to pursue career as a musician (and espcially, FULL-time musician) ?   are they just out of their mind?   but the Reality seems to speak differently: there are surprisingly an increasing amount of musicians (ie: bands, usually "indie" bands)!   why is this?  what is the reasons for they kept wanting to be a musician?

I currently am 24 and have a CPA, but I refuse to go into the BIG 4 again. I thought about going to mid-size CPA firms, but are the hours any different? I think not as i have a couple of friends who work in mid-size, but i hear their busy season isnt that far off. Plus I'm not interested in Tax at all, as i know a lot of mid-size firms like their candidates to work in audit AND tax, and not either or. I thought about going into internal auditing, but i hate controls work as they get really tiresome from my experience at a BIG 4...the only difference is that with internal auditing, the controls are ALREADY established and I'd be doing internal controls for ONE COMPANY, not like an external auditor doing controls work for four different clients. I even thought about going into private industries and doing general corporate accounting. What do you guys think? for someone who isnt so interested in controls work, internal audit wouldn't be such a stretch, but what about corporate accounting?      HELP ANYONE
20090202191558AApKGuL	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Need info on air conditioning?	My Husband and I are renting a small two bedroom apartment that has central heat and air.  The heat is working just fine.  But the air is not.  It is coming on just fine, but no cold air is blowing out.  When we cook, the heat of the kitchen makes our entire apartment hot.  Also if I am working around the house doing chores, I sometimes get hot...this is all due to a medical condition.  So yes, we need our AC in the winter.  So we called the apartment managers and they were to send a tech out to look at it.  We waited at home all day, no tech.  The apartment management made no effort to contact us.  So my Husband went to the office to see what was going on and he was advised that the tech had an emergency and had to go to the hospital.  OK, understood.  But we had a problem with our toilet and needed it attended to for the third time since we've lived here (since Aug of last year)...  So they sent someone to fix that.  They said they'd get to the AC later...      So today, a half week later, they call to follow up on the toilet problem to make sure it was fixed.  My Husband mentions the AC and they inform us that nothing can be done until it gets warmer out.  Well here we are in February, and I am not about to wait another month or two before the AC is fixed.  They said it cannot be fixed until it is warmer.  Is this true?  Can ACs not be fixed, except for warm weather?  The problem is that I sometimes get so hot, I feel like I am suffocating sometimes...and if I get really hot I get nauseous and sometimes worse.  If they do not fix the AC, would we be able to get out of the lease to move to someplace that can provide me with some relief?  I don't think it is right for them to expect us to honor our lease when the AC is not working, and they have no intention of fixing it.
