Most stones are meant to be used with oil not water. You definitely should not store them in water. But even stones that are meant to be used with water there is no reason to store them in it. How will you prevent the water from growing algae and slime mold?|`|9AQPsWpLaa	Yes you can. However any fine grit from sharpenings will very likely rust and leave a stain on the stone. I always dry mine and dust them off.

Stone can vary to much, depending it's rarity, distance to be hauled, and workability. The labor might run the same $700 range as the cement.

They'd be crazy if they didn't, it saves so much time, which is better for the contractor and for your wallet.  I would think any pro knows how to set the pressure properly and proper nail placement.  There are still some out there who believe in the old fashioned hand nail method, and there's nothing wrong with that either, it's just more time consuming.  I just wouldn't worry about whatever method your contractor uses, as long as it's done right!  Good Luck!|`|SpLWveMwaa	I use a nail gun and the only difference is time. As long as they have their compressor set at the right P.S.I. the guns wont blow the nails through the shingles.

The baskets or sacks or aprons full of this harvested sheaved grain with the sheaves and the grain still intact would be dumped into a pile that would be flayed (whipped) with a broom like device or sometimes just flaying sticks would be used.

spFmMOL2aa	no liquid anything works.<br>  <br>  rod it out.|`|440b5eeaa808017d23fb3beb1ec4fa73aa	I'm curious; don't you rinse your dishes before you put them in the dishwasher or don't you have strainer baskets in place in the kitchen sink?<br>  <br>  Anyway, you didn't say whether or not you had a single sink or a double sink, because if you have a double sink fixing the problem yourself is a little more complicated because they are connected together and share the same sewer line.<br>  <br>  The best way to fix a double sink is to pour liquid drain cleaner down the stopped up side. Then, after it sets for a while you have to seal off the other side, while you use a plunger on the plugged side. Once you get the drain open, you would fill both sides of the sink up with hot water and let them empty and the same time. Hopefully, both sides will drain at about the same speed. If they don't, then you need to plug the one that is draining the fastest and use the plunger on the side that is draining slower. Then, refill both sides with hot water again and see how they flow..<br>  <br>  If you have a single sink, then all you can do is use liquid drain cleaner and plunge the hell out if it with hot water.<br>  <br>  Once you have the kitchen sink flowing real good, then I would say try running the dishwasher empty on a short cycle to see how it goes. The idea here is to flush out all the crap you have built up in your drain pipes without having to have a plummer come out, because they will easily cost you several $100. Espcially, if you want them to come out after hours, on a weekend, or on what they consider an emergency call.<br>  <br>  I have found it also helps to do some preventative mantaince to avoid these problems, so in the future watch for when your drains are getting slow and take care of them before they get stopped up. This goes for bathroom sinks, bathtubs and showers too.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|NR3YnkVPaa	If the chemicals don't work you can get a hand rotor snake at K Mart or other store that is similar. I bought one a couple months ago for about 15 bucks. You shove it down the pipe and when it hits the clog you spin it. That will either break through the clog or dig into it enough for you to pull it up (or pieces of it up).  If you end up calling a plumber, call around and ask for quotes. When I did this I found a range from 300 bucks to $75. It was worth a few extra minutes on the phone to save the money. Just go through the yellow pages till you get a quote you can live with.|`|K7M8aWMKaa	Actual plumbing supply stores have a tool that screws to the end of a garden hose.  Take the P trap off and if the clog is in the wall or in the pipe on down the line this tool will work GREAT.  It is a rubber piece that comes in different sizes to accommodate pipe sizes.  When you insert it in the pipe and turn the hose on it will swell inside the pipe sealing it off.  When it continues to fill and swell, it will eventually start spewing water out of the end, into the pipe, clearing it of the clog.  Liquid drain cleaner is costic and will burn your skin.  Once you have it in your pipes be careful.  Wear safety glasses and rubber gloves when you take the P trap apart.  The bucket is a great idea.  This tool may cost you 10 bucks or so, but it is a lot cheaper than a plumber and you can use it over and over for years.|`|94idwoK2aa	Under the sink, there is what's called a P trap.  Take it apart and see if there is a blockage in it.  Use a bucket when taking it apart to prevent a big mess.  Be prepared for some nasty stuff in there.  A lot of times, this is where the problem is.  If the trap is clear, you may have to borrow or rent a small "snake", which is a tool that you feed into the drain to clear the blockage.  If that don't do it, you'll have to call a plumber.  Hope this helps!  Good Luck!|`|qaw8BwqTaa	Liquid Drano always worked for me. Follow direction on bottle!

59f093dfc2cc9473cea87692c7a50804aa	A grounded outlet has a safety ground in addition to the normal two conductors.      <br>  <br>  As others have noted, older houses often have only two-wire outlets.  I also noticed one answer advising to use an adapter which has a ground connection intended to be screwed down under teh cover plate screw.   The problem with those is that most of those two-wire systems do not have grounded outlet boxes, so that cover screw is not really grounded, and connecting to it does not produce a grounded outlet. <br>  <br>  What this all boils down to is a matter of safety.  Grounded outlets, when used with appliances that have a grounded plug, provide an additional measure of safety should the appliance ever develop an internal short-circuit where the hot side of the power line comes in contact with a metal housing or other metal that a person can touch.  In such a scenario, the ground would conduct the current and cause the breaker to trip, alerting you to the defect.  <br>  <br>  If you do not have grounded outlets, you can still use the treadmill, but at some (usually small) risk.   If, for example, your ungrounded treadmill DID develop an internal fault, and you had it on a wet basement floor, and had a penchant for walking around in bare feet, or if you managed to grab the treadmill with one hand and a grounded faucet or metal door frame, etc, with the other hand, you could get a shock.   If enough current flows through you, you could be electrocuted.    OTOH, if the treadmill is on a dry floor, well away from other grounds (pipes, hardwired appliances, etc.), or if you always wear thick soled shoes around it, you are safe to use it ungrounded.|`|BqXSymxjaa	Unless you live in a really old house, all your outlets should be grounded.

What we know for certain is that the practitioners of BD are doing top quality organic agriculture, even if they are wasting their time on the cow horns.<br>  <br>  Planting by the moon is another pillar of BD, and people in many cultures and many times have adhered to this tradition- it seems to work.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps the best path is to deepen your own intuitive understanding of the force that makes life from soil, rather than relying on Steiner's vision.
88SGoW1Iaa	no. no. no. If it's installed properly it will never cause any problems like those. Obviously though, if you have a tank and drainfield underground, you won't want to plant trees directly over them, as the roots will damage underground structures.

Sometimes a more aggressive type of ant moves in, and those ones might not eat sugar.  I've also changed the species of pest ants by using poison baits with sugar in them - it killed off the ants that ate sugar, and then another species moved in (and the sugar/poison bait was no longer attractive - I had to use a different control on those ants).  The world has quite a wide variety of ant species, and they're all different, making it hard to generalize about ants.|`|fI43KljAaa	okay!!, may be no mud around or your kitchen is clean odourless.
rfK4ftpJaa	My last house had a white tile floor and white grout in the bathroom.  At first I used a hand brush with Clorox Clean Up and added in a tooth brush for the hard to reach areas.  I'd just spray on the Clorox Clean Up, let it sit, get down on my hands and knees and work my way out of the room, then finish with a clean water rinse.  Since I've had three kids in the last three years, that was just way too hard on my knees when I was pregnant, so I bought a scrubber brush that attaches to a pole that I could use standing up.  I still sprayed on the Clorox Clean Up, let it sit, scrub, then a clean water rinse and that worked pretty good on the white tile and grout.  That still may be a bit much unless you want a really good workout for your arms and abs since you have so much floor surface to cover.<br>  <br>  You could also try a Hoover FloorMate.  I really like it since it scrubs my floors and pulls up the liquid so my floors aren't wet (I can see the dirty water that's being pulled up...kind of neat).  Or, you could hire a professional tile cleaner to come in every 6 months or so to do a deep clean with you using a microfiber mop w/a mild floor cleaner every so often as needed.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  For more great house cleaning tips, check out <a href="http://www.lifeorganizeit.com/house-cleaning-tips.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifeorganizeit.com/house-clea...</a>

You need to try Maxi Cleaner (LTT) which was specifically formulated for this problem and if this does not remove it then no leather cleaner will and you will need to call a qualified leather technician who will have stronger solvents that he will use and then recolour/refinish whatever is necessary.<br>  <br>  Using a good quality leather protector (Ultra Protect is the strongest one on the market) is imperative on a pale colour leather to help guard against this sort of problem as all clothing etc will give off a certain amount of dye as the body sweats and so this problem will only continue. Using a protector means the dye will sit on the surface and then can be cleaned off easily with a cleaner or maintenance product

Put in similar types of clothing, as you would probably do for each washing machine. <br>  ! would put in 2 coins at first in the drier, as 1 is never enough, then check the clothing after each coin has gone through, so you actually need to stay in the laudromat until finished.

You would just spread the product like lawn fertilizer and it will repel rodents.

However, I found some ways to lower my power bill.  It's actually pretty easy.  <br>  <br>  Unplug stuff when you aren't using it.  There's lots of stuff you leave plugged in that you don't even think about.  Even when it's plugged in but not running, it's using electricity.  You shouldn't have to freeze your tail off during winter.  Stuff I've unplugged are:<br>  <br>  Toaster<br>  Coffee Pot<br>  Microwave<br>  EVERYTHING in guest bedrooms and rooms I am not in often<br>  Stuff in the garage like the washer and dryer.  <br>  The TV in my bedroom (which I don't watch much)<br>  Cell phone chargers<br>  DVD player<br>  Wii<br>  X-Box<br>  <br>  And anything else I don't need to have plugged in all the time.  It may seem like a pain in the butt to plug stuff in when you need to use it, but it's better than a zillion dollar electric bill.  Just don't leave stuff plugged in.  Obviously, I keep my alarm clock plugged in all the time.  I leave certain lamps I need plugged in all the time. Fridge. Things like that..  but we use the game systems infrequently, so we don't need those plugged in every day.  We don't watch DVD's every day.  You get used to plugging stuff in while you're using it, then unplugging it when you're not.  I cut my electric bill in half by doing this, so it's worth it.  Since you live alone, at least you won't have to be the bad guy like me and go around reminding everybody and nagging people.  Heck, I even nag myself!  Just the other day, I was blow drying my hair and the phone rang when I was almost done, then I rushed out the door....  I left the stupid thing plugged in all day and I gave myself a lecture...  Sad, I know.  <br>  <br>  Obviously, things like turning off overhead lights when you leave the room will save energy, but I didn't know about the plugs thing until I read it in the paper.  So, I gave it a try and it worked.  Now we do it all the time!  My microwave is a power hog!|`|GWkfix89aa	It is probably not going to do any good to protest it, but I would call the company just to make sure there was not a mistake. I had a similar problem with our water bill and called to check. Sure enough the machine had made a mistake. I was not the only one it came out in the local papers that the company had made a huge error. I also am aware that all of our utilities bills just went up again (surprise). I called to electric company to see what could be done to reduce our bills. (there are 8 of us in this home and we have recently had a wave a snow) so our bills were outrageous. They suggested that we unplug all things that we did not need. Like our toaster, blender, curling iron.... any Appliances that do not need to be plugged in all the time. We also included things such as phone and Ipod chargers and even the other computers, mixers and all radios that we did not use the clock from. The first month we did not see a difference, however the next month we saw a decent difference. You might want to try this.<br>  Good Luck :)|`|IKq25y8faa	I have similar issue but with other things like my internet bill i called and argued with them a bit and they took off $15<br>  then twice with verizon they were charging me soo much and i threatened to cut the service so one time they took off $20 the other time $67<br>  THEN with chase they charged me $137 because i went under my balance by &13 i called and protested AND i got it all back!!!<br>  so call and try to find ways to get at least some money back.....<br>  <br>  and just keep your heat off, just use alot of warm blankets at night....unless you live somewhere really cold, i live in arizona and lately we've had our a/c running lol......<br>  <br>  <br>  good luckk!!|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Your bill is generated by an automated system just like everyone else's.<br>  The company won't be aware of a problem unless you call and bring it to their attention.<br>  Also,<br>  there are programs or schedules you could join that will even out your payment from month to month.<br>  And also monetary aid for low income households.<br>  They just need some proof of how much you make.<br>  Then they put you on a discounted program.<br>  <br>  All the best..|`|Av9jeRAkaa	just use less electricity than you normally do, everyone's bills are high these days!|`|auUeI2Vnaa	There are months that they don't actually read the meter and charge you based on what you used last year.

New light bulbs for lamps, some bulbs are expensive and if you got ike a wall painting with moving water or somehing it can greatly add to the bill. Id ask if the meter was personallyl read or averaged. A few things like cooking more than normal, a few days of laundry done in hot water, a few luxurious baths and it can jump that high. Most power companies have programs to assist, ask for an application for low income it takes amonth to start but if you qualify it will reduce your bill.<br>  Go to the welfare office and ask if the power programs are available to help right now.|`|xreWOKBYaa	They don't care if you don't have the money to eat - they are a power company not a sympathy company.<br>  <br>  You ran up the bill, and now it is your responsibility to pay it.<br>  <br>  Be a responsible adult and do the right thing.<br>  <br>  If you can not afford to live alone, you should get a room mate or move someplace less expensive.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	You never stated as to how long you have lived in this apartment.

You might want to check into that.<br>  <br>  I have electric heat (as I'm assuming you do, too) and our bill goes from $300-350/month in the winter to less than $80/month over the summer. <br>  <br>  It can't hurt to call them and explain your situation and see what they can do and ask about a "budget plan" or something like that.<br>  <br>  (Edit: They do have one.

sw2R5A9iaa	Tide with Bleach -skip the hot water as you'll just pay more on your utility bill.  pre treat stains.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	According to Consumers Report Liquid Tide is the top laundry detergent there is.  Yes, they do make one that is safe for all colors.  I would recommend you use Shout Stain Remover on the stains before washing.  Spray it on then rub it in.  You could also use Oxi-Clean in with your regular laundry.  You will see a difference just by using Oxi-Clean alone along with your regular detergent.  Hot water sets stains.  Clothing that you are aware of that do have stains you need to wash in cold water/cold water rinse and let air dry so you do not set the stain.  Do not dry in dryer either.  Heat from dryer will set stain also.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	it is not the laundry detergent necessarily but the way you are washing.  I have football players, baseball players and a tomboy. My children love their mud and gunk and my husband is no better  :) I can get any laundry, anytime clean from grass, mud, ketchup, mustard, blood you name it. Hot water will often set stains in.  Depending on the stain you would use different temps of water. I myself use gain and found it to work the best. Try spray and wash, peroxide on light clothes, awesome spray, baking soda and vinegar.|`|y02PZj22aa	I use Tide liquid color safe.  It works well, and if there's a spot or stain, I pour a bit of the detergent directly on the stain.  Sometimes for some stains a bit of spray for stains is required, but not often.<br>  <br>  Spray 'n' Wash is a good spray for stains that won't come out in regular washing.  And be sure to wash blood stains in COLD water--hot water sets blood stains.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Your water supply will have a great influence on how clean your laundry gets.  We currently have a water supply with very little mineral content, so getting clothes clean isn't a big challenge.  However, I have had hard water and I have had well water that was not only hard, it had iron and iron bacteria in large quantity.  With hard water, you may need to *rinse* better--I used vinegar with every washload to get all the hardness minerals out.  With the iron water, though, nothing would work except using a micromet feeder to keep the iron in suspension and a chemical water softener to get everything out.  Until we did that, we had orange clothing.

They probably went way out of their way digging for a store that still had a set that was available (probably a display from another store), and then sent it to you. The set that you received damaged was probably the very last set that exists.<br>  <br>  Return the damaged set and buy a new one somewhere else. Short of going directly to the manufacturer and having one custom made, you're not going to be able to get one. And the manufacturer is not going to honor your receipt from Macy's, so you'll have to pay for it again, probably way more than you paid at Macy's, since it will be custom. And that's assuming that the manufacturer is located in the US, rather than overseas.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  The only sets that Macy's has anymore are ones that have been returned or were display models. They no longer order the set. They are likely unable to do so just for one person. (Ordering furniture lines goes through several different people. The salesperson is not going to be able to do it.) The only way you are going to get that set from Macy's is if you take a display or return.

AA12139345	Most likely, you need to move your strike plate towards the piece of trim that acts as the door stop.<br>  <br>  Another option, if your door has a tendency to 'slam' when closing, is to place a couple of foam 'dots' on the trim piece.<br>  <br>  The foam dots can be bought just about anywhere... a department store, hardware, building, or even office supply store.<br>  <br>  It only takes a few minutes to adjust the strikeplate.<br>  <br>  By the way, if there is no return air vent in the room, the rattle is probably caused by the change in the air pressure, when the central air turns on/off.

There should be one at the top and the bottom of the hinge. Each will have two screws going into the door and two screws going into the wall. Make sure all eight are completely tight. If they aren't, then it could be the hinges themselves. If they appear loose then check for a place to screw them tighter, if they aren't screws try to push the pin into the hinge with a small hammer. If all else fails, go to a hardware store and buy new hinges. They're pretty cheap.|`|5fiGDZJpaa	Sounds like you might be able to adjust the latch... that plate on the door jamb.

If you plant a field of white corn next to a field of blue corn - when the corn tassles - if the pollen of the other variety blows over - then you could end up with white ears with a few blue kernals here and there, or vica versa.    So it's only really an issue if the aesthetics of the color of the kernels is important (which it's not for you - might even make the ears more interesting), or if you're saving the seed and wanting to plant next year and not get hybrids growing (again, not an issue for you).|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	when you plant the seed ,you have already decided what kind of corn you are going to get.it doesn't matter what pollinates it. however if you then plant those seeds then the next plant will bear seeds of a mixture.|`|hbLz0oVNaa	You should be fine.

Lowe's and Home Depot are installing carpet for the entire house for $139.  A good nylon carpet will last a good 10-15 years if you care for it properly, which means to extend to life of your carpet, all you really need to do is vacuum once a week.  However, if you buy builder's grade carpet with a cheap pad, you can expect a laminate flooring in the same price range to last significantly longer.<br>  <br>  What wins?  Probably a high quality carpet with a good pad.  It all depends on how much you want to spend and what you want from your floor.  They are pretty different materials, so it's hard to compare.  If you're attracted to laminate, you might also consider engineered wood as a better option.

If you are going to redo a floor that will get wet or dirty (such as near a front or back door) laminate might be better than carpet.  You can easily wash laminate.  BUT, if you walk on it, it is noisy.  It clicks and sounds hollow because it is a "floating" floor. I put laminate in the entry hall and I HATE IT! I plan to remove it and replace it with ceramic tiles.  If you are planning to redo a room floor, I would use real hardwood flooring.  It is beautiful, durable and sounds sturdy and solid. If the room is a child's room, I would add an area rug for a comfortable place to play on the floor.|`|UJqPMN8Vaa	Laminate, poor man's or not it doesn't have the padding and fiber that attracts and keeps allergens.

Honeybell oranges began shipment in January.  Most of the juice oranges like the Orlando tangelo were quickly harvested within the last two weeks as freezing temperatures hit the state deep into central Florida.

If you have to reverse the pieces that attach to the dowel pins,  and obviously those are off anyway,  Why do you have to take out the pins?  Couldn't you just reverse the pieces?  Oh, unless one pin is glued to the piece(s),  and one in the dresser...  Never mind.  BTW- I doubt that heating it up will get it out.  Especially with Elmer's Wood Glue.  It's not like the adhesive on duct tape,  which you can heat up and remove cleanly.  It's a glue,  which changes its composition when it dries;  like paint.  It actually becomes a different thing.  Cut the pin(s) flush with the  wood,  then just drill a new hole.  You can drill it right through the glued pin(s).  And you can get new pins at your local hardware store.  Best of luck..|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Your going to have to drill them out and put new ones in. The next time think about what your doing and try to imagine what's going to happen.

Drill the center of the pegs with an 1/8"drill,wrap tape around the drill at the proper depth to just reach the inside end of the peg and water can reach the inside of the hole.Grab the peg with vise-grips and twist. If the peg breaks off, just drill the majority of it out, then use a fullsize drill bit by hand with leather gloves to clean out the hole. A small sharp jack-knife blade will clean it out too.

216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Paisley is actually an ornate pattern that was commonly used for 19th-century shawls manufactured in the town of Paisley, a textile center in Scotland. The Scots stole the idea from similarly patterned cashmere shawls made in Kashmir from goat fleece (cashmere-Kashmir, get it?), which began to be imported from India around 1800. The traditional explanation for the commalike paisley motif is that it’s a pine cone, but if so it’s the craziest pine cone I ever saw. Textile historian Martin Hardingham has a better idea; he says it’s “more directly identifiable with the cashew fruit and seed pod which has been a symbol of fertility for thousands of years.””<br>  <br>  nfd?|`|Nv3eQenUaa	Though the recognizable paisley print pattern was originally crafted by Indian artisans, it was brought to Scotland in the early 19th century, where it received its name. Paisley print was named after the Scottish town of Paisley, where printed cotton and wool fabrics were heavily manufactured. <br>  <br>  Wikipedia says this about the development of the pattern:    <br>  Some design scholars call the distinct shape boteh and believe it is the convergence of a stylized floral spray and a cypress tree: a Zoroastrian symbol of life and eternity.[citation needed] A floral motif called buta,[3] which originated in the Safavid Dynasty of Persia (from 1501 to 1736), was a major textile pattern in Iran also during the Qajar Dynasty. In these periods, the pattern was used to decorate royal regalia, crowns, and court garments, as well as textiles used by the general population.<br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful.|`|OsFLwPd7aa	Paisley is Persian and Indian in origin, but its western name derives from the town of Paisley, in central Scotland.|`|aPClcfh9aa	India

Generally speaking, the more expensive stuff is more substantial feeling, has better printing (less muddy, etc.), and will hold up better in whatever you use it for. The reason it's on the shelf as "quilting cotton" is simply because quilting has become very popular in the last dozen years - it's a marketing thing. Twenty years ago it was often referred to as the "calico wall" with no specific mention of quilting vs. garment making. <br>  <br>  Short answer - use it for whatever you like, and judge it based on the individual fabric's characteristics, not on the name someone put on it.|`|sR8AsyyWaa	Hi, if you are just making a simple skirt, you should be okay. Quilting material seems to be a little stiff and might be hard to work with if you are doing any gathering. Be sure to wash the fabric before sewing. It will shrink and soften up quite a bit. If you are worried about seeing through your skirt, there is always a simple solution to that- put a lining in it. It's a lot easier than you think. The easiest way is to sew one end of the lining fabric (which is very inexpensive) into the waistband of the skirt (on the inside) and leave the part of the lining that is hanging down unfinished until you are done hemming the skirt. Then you can trim the lining to the correct length (where it wont show) and hem it also. If it is a full skirt, you may need to tack the lining to the skirt in a few places. Hope that helps.|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	hun quilting threads are heavy duty , thick, would be out of place on a dress. Use regular cotton thread for sewing.
