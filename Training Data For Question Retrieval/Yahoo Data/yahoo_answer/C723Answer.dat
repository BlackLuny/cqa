Why have a computer if your to lazy to look up stuff?|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	You  need  to  buy  an  instant  read  thermometer  and  learn  to  use  it;  it  will  tell  you  when  your  chicken  has  reached  the  right  temperature  and  done.  Here  are  some  tutorial  videos...    http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=ho...    http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=us...      .|`|je8B3Ltzaa	At 325 Celcius you should cook the chicken (if it's unstuffed) for 40 minutes per pound  . If you've stuffed it, increase the time to 45 minutes per pound. However, make sure you take it's internal temperature during cooking...you should insert the thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh. Be careful not to let the thermometer touch any bone, or you'll get an inaccurate reading. The chicken is done when it registers 180 degrees. Good luck!|`|O7CLaTI6aa	slow and low ,, 250. 35m,  oil, rosmary,thyme, oregano ,, all fresh

To coagulate the soymilk Nigari is normally used and can be any of several different salts. I've also made tofu using acids like vinegar and/or citrus juice.    If you need more detailed information either add to your question or email me.|`|7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	Tofu,  or bean curd  made by coagulating soy milk, and then pressing the resulting curds into blocks. The making of tofu from soy milk is similar to the technique of making cheese from milk. Wheat gluten, or seitan, in its steamed and fried forms, is often mistakenly called "tofu" in Asian or vegetarian dishes.

AA10436351	No, you'll be expected to know the math already.  There are no math classes in any culinary school I've ever heard of.  If you don't know the math, you'll struggle.    You use math skills daily while preparing the same recipes for different amounts of people.|`|622ea772914089a4e5db758f396fbb8eaa	I've never been to a culinary school, but there's one close to where I work and I've talked to some of the students.  The general impression I got was that the answer is "No."  However, if you think it through, you will realize that knowing math--at least simple stuff--is a necessity.  (If it requires x amount of sugar in a recipe for one person, how much will you need to add to make it for six?  The answer is not always 6 times "x".)    Oh, and by the way, I hope you know how much it cost to attend one of those places.  I believe one of the students quoted a price to me of $60,000.00!  And that's for a school in this country, although I'm sure prices vary from school to school, as well as country to country.|`|606c88bed2491857ffba4ac2b59fda12aa	I'm getting ready to attent Le Cordon Bleu in Las Vegas and I've heard there is 2 classes that are not Culinary classes and that is Math and Interpersonal Psych.    In the Math class you won't be learning Algebra, Calculus or anything like that, you'll just be learning all the different types of measurement and how to calculate them in any recipe.    All in all, it is an extremely easy class to pass, from what I've heard.|`|aac6ebd14e516abf0695228fede18214aa	It depends on the school and the degree program.  You have to look at the school or your choices to see what program you plan on entering.  Where I graduated from, there was a math general ed requirement for the AAS and the BA, but not for the certificate program, which is shorter.  But most colleges would have tutors available and people that can help you get through the class.|`|f31c719f2f73d4286ecf7dd901e41bccaa	you will need math courses unless they have it in all the classes anyway part of having the culinary arts as  a professional career is knowing how to break down recipes and converting   no not algebra|`|bf28d082330fb3f569140f8ea05feda8aa	Don't worry I'm sure you won't have to do calculus lol. Any other math is basic stuff that everyone should know.|`|fdc12dc20a32707e4a09e3b53eee78ecaa	You will not have a course in Math. But you will need to scale recipes and calculate costs per servings (you will do exercises like scale recipes 7 times or 1/3, menu development including costs per servings, menu prices, and profit.) and budget.  You will also use other related skills such as conversions from fluid ounces, and dry measure to weights.    And (Charles d) my tuition was about $12K plus books, knives uniforms, etc. eleven years ago    Algebra... No I did not use algebra.|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	UNFORTUNATELY YES!!

That's what I hate about math.  People say "You need to learn math and you'll use it in your life, for example you need to know how to change TV channels and how to give tips!"  Guess what people?  I passed 4th grade math with an A.

If wanted the chicken can be removed from the pan and a gravy type sauce can be made from the pan drippings by mixing in a flour/water mixture and thickened by increasing the heat and stirring constantly then serve the chicken with the sauce on top.

Roast some beef bones in the oven at 375 for two hours with salt and peper.    Take a cheap cut of roast and cube into 1 inch cuts of cubes and fry in a pot until golden brown.    Chop up an onion, bell pepper, Hot pepper of your choice. Celery about three stalks with the leaves. Two carrots and fry in pan with the beef.    Add one full can of V8 juice and let this simmer for a couple of hours stirring every so often to unstick the bottom of pan.    Add in your spices Chille powder. Garlic powder. salt. pepper. One cube bitter-sweet dark chocolate.    You can add sharp (old) chedder cheese to thicken chille and a little further demention to your chille.  Chille powder approx. two table spoons  Garlic powder approx. 1 teaspoon  Salt and pepper to taste  Chocolate helps to bring the favours together.  Add a can of mixed beans or red kiddney beans    ~~~~~~~~ Best Chili ~~~~~~~~      Suggested Toppings (any or all):   Sour cream   Finely diced red onion   Coarsely chopped cilantro   Lime wedges   Chopped fresh jalapeno or Serrano chilies   Serving: 6-8    3 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes   2 tsp ancho chili powder   1 tsp chipotle powder (see Tip)   4 tsp coarse salt, plus more for seasoning the chili   1 tsp ground cumin   2 tbsp oil   2 large yellow onions, cut into thick slices   6 garlic cloves, finely chopped   2 poblano chilies, roasted, peeled, seeded, and cut into thick strips   1 1/2 tsp dried oregano   One 35-ounce can diced tomatoes, with liquid   Two 19-ounce cans black beans, drained or 3 cups cooked black or kidney beans   1/2 disk Mexican chocolate or 2 ounces good quality bittersweet chocolate and 1 teaspoon cinnamon     Pat the beef dry with paper towels. Stir the chili powders, salt, and cumin together in a large bowl. Add the beef and toss until the cubes of beef are coated with seasoning. Heat the oil in a heavy 6-quart Dutch oven or heavy casserole over medium-high heat. Add as many of the beef cubes as will fit without crowding. Cook, turning as necessary, until the beef cubes are browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Adjust the heat as you go along so the meat gives off a lively sizzle and browns evenly without splattering. Remove the beef to a plate and repeat with the rest of the beef.   When all the beef is browned, add the onion and garlic to the empty pan. Cook, stirring, until the onions are wilted and have picked up all the brown bits from the bottom and sides of the pan. Stir in the poblano chilies and oregano. Cook 1 minute. Pour in the tomatoes and liquid and 1 cup water. Add the beef and bring to a boil Adjust the heat to simmering. Cover and cook until the beef is tender, about 1? hours. The chili can be made to this point up to 2 days in advance. Refrigerate and return to a simmer over low heat.   Just before serving, remove the chili from the heat and add the chocolate. Stir gently until the chocolate is melted. Serve hot, passing whichever of the topping you like separately, letting people help themselves.     Most bottles in the spice aisle labeled "chili powder" contain a mix of powdered dried chilies as well as seasonings like oregano, salt, and cumin. Search out individual chili powders, like the ancho or chipotle mentioned above or others such as pequin or chili de arbol. If you can't find these individual chili powders, substitute 1 to 2 tablespoons of your favorite chili powder.    Good luck! and get it hot hot hot!!!..._;-)|`|vin4l1NAaa	i got a good chilli idea..... get ya partner (or friend if u r single) to put u in the deep freeze 4 a litle while. u will b chille b4 u know it... if thats doesnt sound 2 appealing just stick an ice cube up ur ar*e

It is very simple to make and very delicious too. Here is the recipe:    1 pound spaghetti  2/3 cup olive oil  2/3 cup grated Parmesan  1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (about 3 lemons)  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 tablespoon lemon zest  1/3 cup chopped fresh basil leaves    Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the oil, Parmesan, and lemon juice in a large bowl to blend.    Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Toss the pasta with the lemon sauce, and the reserved cooking liquid, adding 1/4 cup at a time as needed to moisten. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with lemon zest and chopped basil.|`|42c1974d425360f00a87226743d5f4feaa	One bag of shell pasta, 500g of mild italian sausages, broiled and sliced (if you don't eat meat you can leave this out) 8 large cloves of garlic, pressed, two cans of plain tomato sauce, one zuchinni, two portobello mushroom caps, sliced.  Put everything into a covered oven safe pan, put it in the oven at about 350 for 1 hour and stir about every ten minutes so your pasta doesn't clump together.  Add Sargento Italian cheese blend on top of each serving.  You can substitute shrimp or scallops or both for the italian sausage, if you prefer seafood.

First clean the octopus.  Pull off the tentacles, remove and discard  the intestines and the ink sac, the eyes and the beak.  Skin the  octopus and wash and scrub it thoroughly to remove any traces of sand.  Cut it into 4-5cm (1.5-2inch) pieces and put it into a saucepan over  medium heat to release the liquid.  Stir the octopus until this liquid  has evaporated.  Pour on the oil and stir the octopus to seal it on all sides.  Add the  whole onions and cook them, stirring once or twice, until they colour  slightly.  Add the wine, the vinegar, tomatoes, tomato puree, bay leaves, oregano  and several grindings of pepper.  Stir well, cover the pan and simmer  very gently for 1-1.25 hrs, checking from time to time that the sauce  has not dried out.  If it does - and this would only happen if the  heat were too high - add a little more wine or water.  The octopus is  cooked when it can be easily pierced with a skewer.  The sauce should be thick, like a runny paste.  If any of the liquid  separates, remove the lid from the pan, slightly increase the heat and  stir until some of the liquid evaporates and the sauce thickens.  Discard the bay leaves and stir in the parsley.  Taste the sauce and  adjust the seasoning if necessary.  Serve, if you like, with rice and a salad.  A Greek essential is  country bread to mop up the sauce.    SERVES 4-6.|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	Cook thin spaghetti or angel hair pasta according to package    Blanched Spinach    Dice up some Black olives    Mince up some Basil    Cut Feta cheese into little cubes    Olive oil for drizzling      After pasta is done, put it into a large mixing bowl.

The reason Triple Bock isn't in certain states is because the distributors in those states don't believe there is that high of a demand for it. They can carry other brands and turn them over quicker.

Since its your 21st there will be some people more than willing to help you celebrate with a drink.  Wear something that makes it obvious you're celebrating.  (But be safe!  Drink with caution and stay with your friends)  There's also nothing wrong with prepartying in your hotel room before you go out.  Try Carnival Court.  Its pretty fun.  If you're into beer, the Monte Carlo has a pub that serves it in these giant glass tubes at your table (you'll need to share with some friends).  Kahunaville at T.I. has a huge fogging tropical drink that's pretty fun.  Best advice for a fab 21st - don't worry so much about where to drink.  Find something fun to do and the drinks will be there waiting for you.  Go to a club and have a great time!  Wander the strip during the day and scope out fun places for the night.  Happy Bday!|`|8uF06LE3aa	Cheapest drinks on the Strip are in Casino Royale...but it's a dive...|`|56db083a58b2d55b8cf82d894311dc1faa	The drinks are free as long as you're gambling.

I have yet to try it, but I am definitely going to tomorrow... lol. I cannot wait to see if it actually works... it could be dangerous if it does :) So with that being said, for anyone else who'd like to try, here is the "5 Minute Chocolate Cake" for one person. Enjoy!        *4 tablespoons flour  *4 tablespoons sugar  *2 tablespoons cocoa  *1 egg  *3 tablespoons milk  *3 tablespoons oil  *3 tablespoons chocolate chips (optional)  *A small splash of vanilla extract  *1 large coffee mug (MicroSafe)      Add dry ingredients to mug, and mix well. Add the egg and mix thoroughly.  Pour in the milk and oil and mix well..  Add the chocolate chips (if using) and vanilla extract, and mix again. Put your mug in the microwave and cook for 3 minutes at 1000 watts.  The cake will rise over the top of the mug, but don't be alarmed!  Allow to cool a little, and tip out onto a plate if desired.  EAT ! (this can serve 2 if you want to feel slightly more virtuous).              And why is this the most dangerous cake recipe in the world? Because now we are all only 5 minutes away from chocolate cake at any time of the day or night!

It is wonderful. It is not the traditional cauliflower cheese but it is delicious. For a traditional cauliflower cheese try simply using your favorite macaroni and cheese recipe and instead of noodles add cauliflower.   Cauliflower Gratin   1 (3-pound) head cauliflower, cut into large florets   Kosher salt   4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, divided   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour   2 cups hot milk   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg   3/4 cup freshly grated Gruyere, divided   1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan   1/4 cup fresh bread crumbs   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.   Cook the cauliflower florets in a large pot of boiling salted water for 5 to 6 minutes, until tender but still firm. Drain.   Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes. Pour the hot milk into the butter-flour mixture and stir until it comes to a boil. Boil, whisking constantly, for 1 minute, or until thickened. Off the heat, add 1 teaspoon of salt, the pepper, nutmeg, 1/2 cup of the Gruyere, and the Parmesan.   Pour 1/3 of the sauce on the bottom of an 8 by 11 by 2-inch baking dish. Place the drained cauliflower on top and then spread the rest of the sauce evenly on top. Combine the bread crumbs with the remaining 1/4 cup of Gruyere and sprinkle on top. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and drizzle over the gratin. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the top is browned. Serve hot or at room temperature.       Here is a traditional recipe. You will simply have to do the conversions. But as you can see it is pretty much the same as a macaroni and cheese recipe.    Cauliflower Cheese  1 large Cauliflower   300ml (? pint) Milk   110g (4oz) Cheddar Cheese   3 tbsp Plain Flour   50g (2oz) Butter   25g (1oz) Fresh Breadcrumbs   ? tsp Mustard   Nutmeg   Salt & Black Pepper     Trim the cauliflower boil in salted water for 10-15 minutes or until just tender.   Drain and place in a flameproof dish.   Add the milk, flour and butter to a saucepan.   Heat, stirring continuously until the sauce thickens, boils and is smooth.   Allow to simmer for a further 2 minutes.   Add three-quarters of the grated cheese, mustard, a pinch of nutmeg and seasoning.   Cook for further minute stirring well.   Pour the sauce over the cauliflower.   Mix the remaining cheese and breadcrumbs together, sprinkle over the top.   Place under a hot grill until golden brown.   Serve immediately.       Here is the history of Cauliflower Cheese-  Cauliflower cheese  Cauliflower cheese, sometimes called cauliflower and cheese, is a British dish, usually eaten as a main course for lunch or dinner, that is similar to macaroni cheese, though using cauliflower instead of macaroni. It can also be eaten as an accompanying vegetable to a traditional British "meat and vegetable" type meal.    Cauliflower cheese consists of pieces of cauliflower lightly boiled and covered with a milk-based cheese sauce, for which a strong, hard cheese (such as cheddar) tends to be preferred. The dish is topped with grated cheese (sometimes mixed with bread crumbs) and lightly grilled to finish it.    Pasta and extra ingredients, such as tuna are sometimes added.  There is another way to make a superior cheese sauce to be served upon cauliflower. Firstly create a roux sauce. This simply is the melting of 2-4 ounces of salted butter with 1/3- 1/2 a table spoon of flour. This is then lightly heated together to smoothly bind these initial ingredients together. To this roux sauce is then added enough milk whilst continued heat blends the roux with the milk into a creamy lump free "Sauce bechamel". Care needs to be taken not to over heat the sauce bechamel or it will "Break" and should be thrown away with the chef to start over. Finally enough grated hard cheese i.e. cheddar is added to the bechamel sauce, till the sauce becomes smoothe and glossy. If the sauce appears somewhat granular at this point then sauce has been over heated and "Broken".    I really hope this helps and that you enjoy your Cauliflower Cheese!|`|AA10856550	the recipes given are great but if you want a quicker low fat option try this:    1. Boil cauliflower in microwave for 15 min on high  2. Grate the amount of low fat cheese you want  3. pour low fat milk in sauce pan add salt & pepper and bring to the boil  4. mix a teaspoon & a half of corn flower with 125ml of low fat milk and add too boiling milk.  5. use a whisk to stir coz it is going to thicken very quickly. take off stove and add grated cheese and mix till cheese is melted.  6. add cheese sause to cauliflower and sprinkle some cheese on top and bake till cheese melts. ( you can also add some grated tomato to the cheese sauce)    If you want you can add brocoli, carrots and green beans. very tasty with grilled chicken or steak.

I usually use half a teaspoon of mustard powder, but I guess a dollop of normal musturd would work too and add it before the cheese.

Other recipes just apply a coating to give it a fried texture, as does this recipe. This recipe is taken straight from a book called Top Secret Restaurant Recipes: Creating Kitchen Clones from America's Favorite Restaurant Chains written by Todd Wilbur. If you like trying to imitate restaurant recipes at home go buy his book.     ? cup vegetable oil   2 flour tortillas, 6 inch each   ? teaspoon ground cinnamon   2 tbs. sugar   ? cup cornflake crumbs   2 large scoops vanilla ice cream   whipped cream in a can   2 maraschino cherries with stems   optional toppings: honey, chocolate syrup, strawberries         Fry each tortilla, one at a time in hot oil over medium/high heat until crispy. This should take about one minute on each side.     Combine the cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl.     Sprinkle half of the cinnamon mixture over both sides of the fried tortillas, coating evenly. Not all of the sugar mixture will stick to the tortillas and that's okay.     Combine the other half of the cinnamon mixture with the corn flake crumbs in another small bowl. Pour the corn flake mixture into a wide shallow bowl or plate.     Place a large scoop of ice cream in the corn flake crumbs and with your hands roll the ice cream around until the entire surface is evenly coated with corn flake crumbs. You should not be able to see any ice cream.     Place the ice cream scoop on the center of the cinnamon/sugar coated tortilla.     Spray whipped cream around the base of the ice cream. Spray an additional pile of ice cream on top of the ice cream. Put a cherry in the top pile of whipped cream.     Repeat for the remaining scoop of ice cream.         -|`|TQixspJdaa	Vanilla ice cream between two crunchy toasted waffles.  Quick and simple...and you'll want more.

Most people just skip the rum altogether when they've making virgin coladas but do whatever works best for you. However start off with a very tiny amount and gradually add more to taste.|`|fbb74ff00bf5ccffec646cf3e5a7c537aa	I don't see how else you'd do it.|`|AA10472989	Yes, it is perfectly fine to use rum extract, if you want the rum flavor to be there. Virgin pina coladas are great without also, experiment with using it and not using it and see which you like better!|`|3a1ec0c18c373bcede42ae550c505859aa	Yes, just don't use as much or the flavour will be very over powering.  Start with a teaspoon or so and work you way up to the flavour of your liking.  You may also have to compensate with juice or water for the missing liquid if you find them too thick.  But, a nice thick pina colada could be yummy!

4Tt86CNsaa	vegetable oil is fine as a substitute for olive oil. the difference is the viscosity and flavour. olive oil tends to be a little thicker and adds more flavour. if the recipe calls for olive oil, you will be missing the full flavour of the dish by substituting veg- oil. olive oil is more expensive but when you develop a taste for it, you will probably find yourself making room in your grocery budget to have it on hand lol.|`|gQ26TFYEaa	mix them together :D nah kidding, if the recipie says use olive oil theres abviously a reason so use it :)|`|L0a3Q1Rqaa	The only place where it will make a difference is in stir frying. Stir frying is done at high heat and many veggie oils will break down and burn. I use peanut oil for stir frying.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Yep you can just vegetable oil instead of olive oil. The results will be almost the same, with just a small difference in taste. Most people prefer the taste of olive oil where the taste is appropriate. Olive oil is also healthier. It contains monounsaturated fat, which is healthy because it regulates your cholesterol levels or some such thing (sorry I'm no expert) and it has antioxidants and supposedly it can lower your risk of heart disease. Extra virgin is the least processed type of olive oil so go with that if you decide to buy some.|`|zawmsUO1aa	Olive oil has a much lower smoking point than vegetable oil - pretty similar to butter.|`|Wwry0QIlaa	I don't know the difference in terms of what they're made of, but olive oil you use for cooking and vegetable oil you use for baking...DON'T SWITCH THEM!!

In most cooking regular vegetable oil will work.
cLOKLDowaa	Easy, Easy Doughnuts  The first time we made our homemade doughnuts we used premade biscuits in the tube. This is so much fun, and it just doesn't get any easier. You will need:  2-4 tubes of buttermilk or homestyle biscuits  Confectioners' sugar  Cinnamon  Granulated sugar  vegetable oil for frying  a candy/oil thermometer (optional, but VERY useful)  tiny round cookie cutter (see below for option)  stainless steel tongs  cookie sheets lightly sprayed with cooking spray  paper towel  plates    Remove biscuits from tubes and place on sprayed cookie sheet, one tube at a time works well. Take a tiny 1 inch cookie cutter, or as I used, a clean medicine cup that comes with children's pain reliever (it's the perfect size!). Press down in the middle of each biscuit until it cuts through the dough. Remove hole and set aside on a cookie sheet. This is the "assembly line" part if the kids are helping.    While you are preparing doughnuts, heat your oil in a fryer or on top of the stove in a large pan (cast iron works well for this) until oil is 370 degrees. Place 3 or 4 doughnuts at a time in the oil, watching carefully. When the bottom is golden brown, flip over with the tongs, to fry the other side. This happens very quickly! Remove doughnuts to a cookie sheet lined with paper towel. Allow to drain/cool just for one minute or so then drop in coating. When coated remove to a plate. The "holes" can be done last. Be careful, these fry VERY fast because they are so small.    Coatings: We used plain confectioners' sugar, and cinnamon mixed with granulated sugar until light brown in color. Place each coating in a medium size bowl.|`|RK1AO2Rnaa	this recipe is relatively easy :)    http://hubpages.com/hub/How-to-Make-Deli...|`|66d4c43f12acd1316044f7c16cfb569caa	lories  got it right|`|IDgSVPBxaa	lorie got it right on my grandmother taught me that one.

AA10582400	BC is not into liquor stores nor is Hillary.  Chicago reportedly has 10.25 sales tax on everything taxable, the highest in the 50 states.  Liquor has been taxed for centuries, hence the "Whiskey Rebellion".    High sugar prices reportedly killed moonshine although some will alays be produced, not necessarily SOLD.  With a permit anyone is allowed to produce 250 gallons per year for personal use.  This was not true during "Prohibition" which has been attributed MORE  to Rockyfeller's Standard Oil GREED than to teetotaler influence AKA Carrie-Nations'-hatchet-to-the-kegs types.  Yes, Elliot Ness was an enforcer and he did chase Al Capone, who unlike modern-day tax cheats, did go to prison for "cheating on his taxes".  Feds counted towels in Capones' brothels, estimated one per customer and billed Capone accordingly as a tax cheat.  About 1/2 of Obama's Cabinet choices are bonifide-100% top-rated TAX cheats and scoff-laws to boot.  This makes them highly DESIRABLE as all the lawyer friends will think they are TOP NOTCHERS and MUGWOMPS.  Apologies are in order for any surviving "Mamas and Papas" Band members.  They used to be the "MugWOMPS"
GY4yYB6jaa	People go undercover working in slaughterhouses, research labs etc and obtain the footage. They then hand the footage over to PeTA.

If you are young or poor, there is the excuse not to go to dinner.  And let's face it, at the movies when you don't talk, your breath gets stale so you need something to keep the saliva moving and eating popcorn keeps bad breath away.|`|AA11123061	just something to munch . it passes the time and when u r watching a horror movie that its also good to concentrate on the popcorn ..
t0vuwuGXaa	No, it is perfectly legal to ship wine.  Check with the shipping company to see if it is against their policy though.  Also, be sure to package it carefully so you don't have any casualties during shipment.    I would suggest against it though, it's just really expensive because it is so heavy.  Besides, Chateau Ste Michelle and Columbia Winery are great WA wineries and should be available in Kentucky.

O5Tuvb1Vaa	Depends on the temperature in your house.  If it's not to hot it would be o.k. to leave it out for a night.|`|AA11454606	Here's the facts:   All uneaten food should be refrigerated as soon as possible after cooking. Home fridges do not have the same cooling strength as commercial so sometimes it is easier on your equipment to let soup for example cool a little. Otherwise you run the risk of warming all the food in your fridge a few degrees.  If your soup has been made from scratch it is certain that all the ingredients have been heated to the point where there is very little chance of bacteria surviving.  Food left between 40 and 140 degrees has a better chance of breeding the bacteria that causes food born illness. This happens for about 4 hours. In that four hours if you bring the food to over 165 degrees you will kill most of the bacteria and it should be pretty safe. After 4 hours the bacteria begins to create toxins. You cannot get rid of these toxins even by heating properly. This is when you throw it out or up.|`|zawmsUO1aa	Unless your house is as cold as a walk-in refrigerator, put the soup in the fridge. There would be absolutely no benefit to leaving it out.|`|Ectn7tkSaa	Definitely put it in the fridge!

Ever.|`|AA11620976	Before you get into the refrigerator you need to get it down to about 60- degrees first  The way that you do that is that you immerse the metal pot *that it was cooked in a sink full of ice water and stir the soup slowly but continually   As your soup gets colder your water will of course get warmer and you  may have to periodically add more cold water and/or more cubes.  In a commercial sink you would of course just let the cold water run and it over flow from a drain on top of the sink in a home sink that may be a little harder to do  Note 1  Do not immerse your soup pot so much that  it starts to float >ice water coming about 3/4 of the way up the side of the pot will do   Note 2  If you used a crock pot then transfer your soup to a metal pot before giving it an ice water bath   Note 3   Use a properly calibrated instant read thermometer to get your temps with /  Note 4  Never cover a hot /warm product when you put it in the refrigerator b/c it will stay warmer and therefore in the danger zone much longer|`|moxrIqykaa	yes put in into the refrigerator.  leaving it out will only get you a nice case of diarrhea.

(i forgot to look at your pic -_- )   so idk if you are or not.   but if you are, you will find that your tired during your period.   but when your a vegetarian and/or your iron levels are low you'll be SO tired. but like i said, a viatmin would easily aid you through that week.    as for that person with the social life argument.  thats bull s h i t.   i'm a pretty social person thanks.       and haha, your a dude... so nvm about that girl advice.    BUT YOU SHOULD STILL TAKE A VITAMIN  because with low iron and being tired you can risk the potential of becoming anemic.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Ridicule is about the ONLY disadvantage of being vegetarian. And if you like meat a lot you don't get to enjoy it anymore, so depending on the person, that might also be a disadvantage.

Stay up awhile|`|t0vuwuGXaa	The problem with eating right before bed is that your body won't use much of the calories when you sleep, instead storing it as fat.    So no, it's not the worst thing in the world but it will contribute to weight gain.    Try regulating your diet by eating at the same times every day.  Breakfast is super important as it gets your metabolism going for the day.
bQySjz1Raa	Once formula is opened it's only good for the 48 hrs that it says on the can. As for the baby food, once you feed the baby from jar (spoon going from baby's mouth back into jar) you can't use that food again. Used baby food stored in fridge can grow bacteria. What I used to do when my kids first started eating, was put about half the food in a bowl & heat it up (about 1/2 the time it has on jar), the unused portion I would leave in the jar & refrigerate it. Also, I always made sure that the refrigerated portion was used the next day. Just remember, any portion the baby's eaten directly from can't be kept & I don't think it can be stored if it's been heated up & the baby doesn't eat it.|`|rnERBHqZaa	The formula should be used within 48 hours.

da580af9e5114d80d24d6e1ac5858417aa	I am seriously intrigued by your question, and as a very seasoned and avid cook will be researching this!  Thanks ... not often that I see a question that I completely do not have either an answer for or even a wee bit of knowledge about.  Eggs are very necessary in lots of recipes, used either as a binder, flavor, or as a main player in a recipe.    I am not a vegan, but 99% vegetarian, and do depend upon eggs for protein (in fact, it is one of my main sources).  I love eggs, but well cooked.    Thanks for the brain exercise, and I will update this post after checking out what chefs have to say ;)|`|AA12031316	I am allergic to eggs, so I leave them out of everything!  In baking, I substitute ground flax seed or tapioca starch softened in water.  I do alot of gluten free baking, and it works perfectly.  I am not much on following recipes-I prefer to just chuck stuff in until it looks right, and it usually works great!   I think eggs are often added as a binder, or for extra richness or nutrition, but, like you, I don't find them necessary in most things.  I even make an eggless "quiche" using cauliflour puree instead of the eggs-its lovely!  I gave a piece to my mom and she didn't even realize it was eggless!  Now, she uses the recipe to save on the cholesterol, lol!|`|05ff5bb18eb4c096ef430ca99d7dad2daa	I tend to leave out as much of the salt that recipes call for. It's just too much for me and I cut down the amounts to how ever much I want to make. Eggs are good for you to a point so don't totally for go them. Eggs help hold parts of dough together and make hamburgers softer when they cook. I adjust as it's needed but try not to totally cut something out unless I know I like it that way.
HxXduL1maa	Gingeris a tasty, aromatic spice that has been a mainstay of Asian and Indian cuisine and traditional medicine for thousands of years.   Ginger has been used in traditional Asian medicine to treat nausea, stimulate appetite, fight body odor, and promote perspiration. Indian ayurvedic medicine traditionally recommends ginger for the treatment of arthritis, and recent studies have shown that ginger does indeed inhibit the production of cytokines, which are chemicals that can promote inflammation.     Ginger also treats joint pain by stimulating blood circulation  ginger is beneficial to the heart as well. 5 grams of dried ginger a day slows the production of triglycerides and LDL (bad) cholesterol in the liver. Ginger also guards against heart attack and stroke by preventing the platelet clumping or stickiness that can lead to blood clots and atherosclerosis.     When given in large doses, ginger also seems to be effective for treating nausea induced by chemotherapy when given in large doses.     Pregnant women have reported relief from consuming small amounts of ginger root, ginger tea, and ginger ale. However, women should not consume large amounts of ginger during pregnancy, as it can cause the uterus to contract.     Ginger is also often used for treatment of flatulence, indigestion, diarrhea, and menstrual cramps. This is because ginger mimics some digestive enzymes used to process protein in the body, and is known to act as a gastronintestinal antispasmodic. Commission E, a panel in Germany that evaluates herbs for the government, recommends ginger to prevent and treat indigestion.     Ginger is also sometimes recommended for relief of cold symptomsit helps to loosen phlegm and fight chills by spreading a warm feeling throughout the body. Pickled ginger is traditionally eaten with sushi, probably because of its ability to destroy parasites.     The ginger root may be consumed raw, steeped in hot water to make a tea, or added to a variety of dishes. Ginger is also available in capsules, pickles, extracts, and prepared teas that can be made into compresses.     Pregnant women should be careful not to overdo it when taking ginger supplements; it has been said to stimulate uterine contractions. People taking blood thinners, barbiturates, beta-blockers, insulin or diabetes medications should consult a physician before supplementing with ginger on a regular basis, since it may increase the effects of these medications.     Ginger may interfere with the absorption of dietary iron and fat-soluble vitamins, and cause stomach upset in higher doses. Also, because ginger helps thin the blood, it should not be taken two weeks prior to surgery.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	You can eat too much ginger, especially if it is sweetened. Ginger is a blood thinner much like aspirin, and too much blood thinner can cause bleeding on the brain. I also love ginger, but try to space it out. Ginger has a lot of good uses, but like someone else said you can get too much of anything if you overdo it. It is likely your taste for it is caused by something good it is doing for your body. I started craving ginger when I was in my late 30's, a little bit after I was getting rheumatoid arthritis. Consuming ginger helps with the inflammation and pain of the arthritis. It is much safer for me than aspirin or the other recommended anti-inflammatories, they are terrible on my stomach.|`|QWaspeg7aa	Ginger is really good for you and pickled ginger is gorgeous  so knock yourself out.|`|mlmSRkhGaa	Ginger is good for you in many ways.  Vinegar is not bad for the body, but some people find it too acidic to eat a lot of.  If you feel stomach burning, Id lay off for a while.|`|BWxSSADaaa	The truth is, eating a lot of anything is sure to make you feel bad.  Even something as wholesome as an apple ... if you overdo it, you'll be feeling the consequences.  Ginger is the same, I think.  I've never tested that (I have with the apples, that's why I mentioned it), but I'm sure you can eat enough to feel bad if you try.    Now, a concern may be if you are sensitive to artificial sweeteners.  Most pickled ginger I have bought from stores (even Asian ones) contains aspartame.  If you have a sensitivity to that stuff, you may want to lay off.  Unless your version doesn't use that.|`|AA10824931	Ginger is great for the stomach and so is vinegar!  Enjoy!

829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Yes,  In the beginning it was meant to have 0 pesticides.  But farmers were getting very little yield out of their field( due to insects).

Since then, the list of allowed pesticides have grown.    http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~lhom/organi...|`|AA12031316	If it is grown commercially, then it very likely does.  The FDA allowed 1 pesticide to be used for things to be still considered organic, but as usual, the companies bend the rules.  AIthough it is a more natural pesticide than used on conventionally grown stuff, its still not good.  Thats why I grow as much of my own stuff as I can, and buy from trusted sources for other things, so I know what has been used.  Joining a local food co op can help you find things that way.|`|QjhrfHnGaa	I'm pretty sure they don't.  That's one of the things that makes them organic actually.|`|5fKnal6Haa	Okay u know what? I used to know this answer but I forgot them out. But I used to believe that organic food doesn't have pesticides in it a few minutes ago. Then I did a little research and people found out now some organic foods has pesticides in it.   Ok here's the research website: http://www.allbusiness.com/government/en...    This website will help u find your answer.|`|qzY2tRTeaa	yes they do have some in them.|`|FxWppY7Baa	There have always been organic pesticides. organic farming does not mean benign neglect and that is what you would be doing if you had no pest control. And you more often than not have huge crop losses and all organic farms would have been out of business long before the USDA NOP came into effect (before the national organic program there were over 55 private and state run organic certification programs-my farm was certified by OEFFA)    While good organic farm managers try fro an ecological balance between good insects (which make up about 97% of the insect world) and pests at times the balance goes out of whack and some sort of control must be used and that is always some sort of pesticide.    Unlike conventional pesticides that use a lot of chemicals that will persist in the environment for years organic pesticides are plant or mineral based and generally persist no more than 24 hours in the environment.     Organic farmers use a lot more than chemicals to control pests and diseases as well. Crop rotation, building healthy soil, companion planting, beneficial insects and other animals, row covers, season extension, etc..
x3rqmwrNaa	I always liked "The Grand Old Duke of York". Quite straightforward: You nominate somebody, and they have to say the nursery rhyme in it's entirety; they will usually do this in one go. Then for the second round; they have to say it again, only this time they cannot use the word "and"; including any word which has the word "and" in it. If they make a mistake they have to do a forfeit (e.g. a shot) and start all over again. It's much harder than it sounds as they will forget words like "grAND" and "ThousAND".     Then if they make it through, in the next round it becomes even harder. They must start again, only this time they cannot use the words "and", "up" or "down".     The correct answer would be:     The old duke of york, he had ten men, he marched them to the top of the hill, he marched them again. When they were they were, when they were they were, when they were only halfway, they were neither nor." (It's even difficult typing it without any alcohol!!)

But they have to be cured in water which has no salt.  So you will have to do that yourself by following this link : http://www.wikihow.com/Cure-Olives  Use the first method called 'Water curing'.    The second most healthy form is : Extra Virgin Olive oil ( or ie cold pressed ,first pressing) bottled in a dark glass bottle from olives grown in your own country.  If the olive oil bottle is imported from Europe etc then the oil inside could be a mixture 'from local and imported oils' and so some of that oil could be rancid and too old.  Hopefully, olive oils are organic by default, because there are no/not many pests on the tree to be sprayed with toxic chemicals.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Raw?  Filled with pomace?  What's pomace?

HoFL0tCtaa	Sushi               Categora: Especialidades internacionales  Dificultad: Moderado      Ingredientes:  Arroz para Sushi:       Para la caballa para hacer maki-sushi, para lo que necesitamos:     - Caballa fresca (limpia de espinas y hecha dos filetes)   - Azcar   - Vinagre de arroz   - Sal gorda       Para el sushi   Ingredientes:     - Arroz para sushi   - Algas nori para maki-sushi   - Atn fresco   - Salmn fresco   - Gambas frescas   - Huevas de trucha o de salmn   - Aguacates   - Wasabi   - Salsa de soja (para poner en la mesa)          SUSHI     Arroz para Sushi:     Ingredientes:   - Arroz de grano corto   - Agua   - Vinagre de arroz   - Azcar   - Sal          Las cantidades dependen del sushi que vayis a hacer. Para que os hagis una idea con dos vasos (de los de agua) de arroz, comimos dos das dos personas, pero muy bien comidos.   Primero lavamos el arroz. Para ello lo ponemos con abundante agua y lo movemos para que suelte el almidn, luego lo colamos le cambiamos el agua y a lavar de nuevo, eso lo hacemos unas 7 veces, nos llevar unos 25 minutos, es muy importante que el arroz quede muy limpio.        Una vez el arroz est bien lavado, lo ponemos con el agua al fuego y removemos. Las cantidades son 1 medida de arroz por 1 ? de agua (ejm. Para 2 vasos de arroz, 3 vasos de agua). Tapamos el arroz con la tapa y no vamos a levantar la tapa en ningn momento hasta el final. Ponemos a medio fuego y pasados 5 minutos, bajamos al mnimo y lo dejamos 10 minutos. Pasado el tiempo retiramos del fuego y dejamos reposar unos 10 o 15 minutos mas, pero muy importante sin levantar la tapa.     Mientras se hace el arroz, vamos a preparar una mezcla con los otros ingredientes. Esta mezcla de llama sushizu, y se le a?adir luego al arroz.   Ponemos en un cazo 1 parte de vinagre de arroz, ? parte de azcar y ? parte de sal (ejm. 8 cucharadas de vinagre, 4 cucharadas de azcar y 2 cucharadas de sal). Ponemos el cazo en el fuego hasta que se deshagan el azcar y la sal.      Cuando est listo lo pasamos a un recipiente y lo dejamos templar.   Ahora ya tenemos listo el arroz y el sushizu.          Ponemos el arroz en un recipiente amplio, preferiblemente de madera, pero si no se tiene (como yo de momento) pues de otro material. Echamos el sushizu en el arroz (yo ech un poco mas de la mitad, pero lo hice a ojo), con una cuchara de madera empezamos a removerlo para enfriarlo, y tambin a abanicarlo. Esto nos llevar un rato. El arroz tiene que quedar pringosillo pero a la vez suelto.        El arroz ya est listo.   Ahora vamos con la segunda parte, que es el sushi.     SUSHI:     Hay dos tipos de sushi, uno se llama maki-sushi, que son unos rollitos de alga nori, y otro se llama nigiri-sushi, que son unas bolitas de arroz con una lamina de pescado encima.       Vamos a preparar la caballa para hacer maki-sushi, para lo que necesitamos:     - Caballa fresca (limpia de espinas y hecha dos filetes)   - Azcar   - Vinagre de arroz   - Sal gorda          En una fuente un poco honda, ponemos un poco de azcar.        Ponemos un poco de vinagre de arroz.        Ponemos los filetes de caballa con la piel hacia arriba.        Las cubrimos con sal gorda.        Y las metemos unas 2 horas en la nevera. A las dos horas, las sacamos, las lavamos con agua fra, y las ponemos en una tabla para limpiarlas. Primero les quitamos la piel tirando de ella con cuidado, luego tenemos que quitarle a cada filete una hilera de espinas que tienen en el medio, para ello vamos cortando con el cuchillo por todo el borde de la hilera, tanto de un lado como del otro, de tal manera que quede de la siguiente manera. El filete de arriba est sin limpiar y se le ve la hilera de espinas. El filete de abajo est limpio y la hilera es la del medio, la cul va a la basura.          Las tiras de caballa, nos valen para hacer los makis.   Todo el paso de las caballas, hay que hacerlo con antelacin, para que estn listas para cuando vayamos a preparar el sushi.     Ingredientes:     - Arroz para sushi   - Algas nori para maki-sushi   - Atn fresco   - Salmn fresco   - Gambas frescas   - Huevas de trucha o de salmn   - Aguacates   - Wasabi   - Salsa de soja (para poner en la mesa)        Pelamos las gambas, ponemos a hervir en un cazo agua con sal, y cuando empiece a hervir, echamos una cucharadita de vinagre de arroz y tambin las gambas, y las cocemos a fuego bajo durante un minuto. Pasado el minuto las colamos y las echamos en un bol donde hayamos puesto hielo con agua fra para romper la coccin y enfriarlas rpidamente. Luego cortamos el pescado. Vamos a cortarlo de dos formas distintas, una para hacer maki-sushi, que se cortan tiras de unos 2 cm de grosor y de largas como la anchura de la hoja de nori, y la otra para hacer nigiri-sushi, que se cortan unas laminas finitas para luego cubrir las bolitas de arroz.

Para elaborar un sushi correcto, debes disponer como material imprescindible: lminas de alga Nori y arroz glutinoso (se puede hacer con otras variedades de arroz pero el resultado no es el mismo).  La base es: hervir el arroz con agua y escurrirlo. Una vez llegado a este punto se puede utilizar tal cual o "perfumarlo" con vinagre de arroz y atn seco y en polvo.  Se coge una hoja de alga Nori y se tuesta ligeramente (una pasada sobre el quemador de la cocina) por una de las caras. Se coloca la hoja de alga sobre una esterilla de bamb (para facilitar el enrrollamiento) y se procede a intercalar sobre el alga (con la cara tostada hacia afuera) arroz y el material que se utilice de relleno. Una vez finalizada esta operacin se procede a enrollar sobre si misma la hoja de alga (como si se tratase de un caneln), teniendo cuidado de mojar con agua de arroz la parte final del alga para facilitar su adherencia. Una vez enrollado se corta el cilindro en varios tacos, utilizando para ello un cuchillo muy bien afilado mojado previamente en agua para evitar que quede pegado al arroz.   Se sirve acompa?ado con salsa de soja y wasabe (pasta de rbanos picantes).  La adquisicin de estos productos es bastante sencilla; el alga Nori la encontrars en cualquier tienda de macrobitica o productos dietticos, el arroz lo puedes conseguir en supermercados algo grandes, la salsa de soja esta muy generalizada en comercios de diettica, y la salsa de rbanos puede ser suplida sin demasiado engorro por una buena mostaza o salsa Harissa.       --- SASHIMI FACIL ---    Ahora que llega el verano quera pasaros la receta de un aperitivo o entrante, segn se mire, muy popular en Japn. De entrada dir que se trata de un plato a base de pescado crudo. Atn, jurel, dorada, lubina, rodaballo y sepia o calamar son los ms usuales, aunque hay quien emplea tambin salmn, mientras que bacalao y merluza no son aptas. Armas: un cuchillo de ms o menos 30x4 cm, extremadamente afilado (los de sierra son anatema), tabla de cortar grande y trapo de cocina bien limpio por que la asepsia es un condimento ms.    El pescado a emplear tiene que estar prcticamente vivo, fresqusimo y sin sombra de olor. Algunos como el atn son muy complicados de cortar y no todas sus partes son aptas as que es mejor no meterse con ellos. Los ms asequibles son la sepia y la dorada.   Primero: Obtener filetes. Si no estis fuertes pedid que os los hagan en la pescatera y les saquen la piel. Por persona tocarn unos ciento cincuenta gramos, as que calculad bien al comprar para que no os salga por las orejas.   Segundo: Cortar. Antes extraed con unas pinzas las espinas del interior de los filetes. Una vez hayis hecho esto, valindoos del cuchillo largo cortar perpendicularmente los filetes de pescado en tiritas de cuatro o cinco milmetros, y se disponen en un plato lo ms delicadamente posible tratando de hacer algn dise?o con ellos aprovechando los diferentes colores y texturas. Cada vez que cambiis de tipo de pescado limpiad y secad bien la tabla para que no se mezclen los sabores.  Este plato se acompa?a de una especie de mojo que cada comensal se prepara l mismo mezclando en un platito a parte -uno de caf servir- una pasta a base de una especia picante llamada wasabi y salsa de soja. Poned en una esquina del plato de pescado de cada comensal una porcin de la citada pasta de wasabi imitando en forma y cantidad a un dedalito. Un peque?o plato de caf servir como salsera individual. Lo ponis al lado del plato de pescado de cada persona y en l echis un chorrito -sin exagerar- de shoyu, salsa de soja japonesa. La mezcla resultante es fuerte, as que no conviene abusar so pena de recibir un desatascado nasal turbo. Tanto la pasta de wasabi como la salsa de soja podis adquirirlos en una tienda de artculos japoneses. En Barcelona hay una particularmente bien surtida que se llama Tokyo-Ya, que est en la Avenida de Roma no 53, entre Rocafort y Entenza. Se consume todo inmediatamente despus de haberlo preparado. Cmo se come. Primero cada uno se hace su mojo mezclando algo de su pasta de wasabi con la salsa de soja de su salsera. Entonces se toma -preferentemente con palillos- un trocito de pescado, se moja un extremo en el mojo y se saborea sin complejos. Lo ms difcil de todo esto es evitar las exageraciones.   Es un plato finsimo en lo que lo ms importante es el equilibrio de los sabores sin que ninguno de ellos se sobreponga ahogando a los dems. Los puristas lo acompa?an con sake, caliente o fro segn la estacin, pero yo lo disfruto sin contemplaciones con vino blanco muy seco o un buen cava brut.     Sushi variado (Nigiri y Maki)    Ingredientes:      Arroz para sushi      2 tazas arroz grano redondo(use el de toda la vida)    3 tazas y media de agua     ALI?O DEL ARROZ:    7 c.s vinagre de arroz    6 c.s azucar    1/2 c.s sal     RELLENO:    mayonesa   pepino   zanahoria   tortilla   aguacate   tronkitos cangrejo  y en general lo que querais.      1 paquete algas nori    Wasabi y salsa de soja para mojar.          Preparacin:        Pasar el arroz por el grifo del agua hasta que el agua salga clarita.   Despues, lo dejamos en remojo 12 minutos.   Colamos, y lo ponemos a hervir a fuego fuerte con el agua, y cuando hierva lo bajamos a fuego lento hasta que se consuma el agua..   Yo lo echo a un tupper alargado y plano, y le a?ado el ali?o, previamente mezclado todo, lo remuevo todo bien para ir aireando el arroz, lo dejo tapado con un pa?o

Caliber is the best n/a beer.|`|AA11189961	It's sacrilegious to even think of non-alcoholic beer, but YES it does have some alcohol (thats why you can't buy it if you're under 21).  Non-alcoholic beers have to be below .5% in the US and most of Europe which means that it would take about 8 of these to reach an average beer of 4%.  You can do the math on how many you would need to drink to actually feel something.|`|0CnW95saaa	The highest alcohol content on a 'non-alcoholic' beer is .5 %.    Your average beer has about 6% or higher.  So it would take an minimum of 12 'non-alcohol' beers to equal ONE regular beer.    Thus you'd need to drink an entire case of 'non-alcoholic' beer to equal 2 regular beers.  Considering how much liquid that is, and how little alcohol that is, I'm not sure you'd even feel tipsy before you had to empy your bladder 5 or 6 times.|`|4LKm4ghWaa	Yes, they have it.|`|6SMQ4cIwaa	none|`|SKKtNaADaa	You cant get drunk by drinking non-alcoholic beer if that is what you are asking.|`|f2lx3Gxbaa	Dish water tastes better than non-alcoholic beer|`|xthHLGpvaa	Brother I know of a bean beer that is pretty good, but its alcoholic ...

Wine making as a hobby is very popular and is legal almost everywhere.  You can go to a wine hobby shop and buy the juice, yeast, fermentor, gas trap, etc and make some perfectly good wines.    As for alcohol poisoning, it is related to the amount of alcohol consumed.  Of course you need to remember that not all alcohol is safe to drink.  The form of alcohol in what you would make in either homemade wine or beer is ethanol, which is safe to drink in moderation.      While I haven't attempted any wine making, yet, I have been brewing my own beer for more than ten years and have made some very good beers with no ill effects.|`|bcd579b5470241b294acd9a9b0bbef85aa	To answer your question:  Alcohol poisoning is a factor of quantity of alcohol consumed, not the quality.

d39a1459adc2309ffddda17f75e3dac3aa	there are a ton of vinegars out there. white, apple cider, white wine, red wine, and the list can keep going for a bit. you can use them in any recipe that calls for it from potato salads to marinades. is there something you were wanting to cook with it?   the white is best for pickling, apple cider is good for salads  white and red wine are good for sauces and some salads. lets not forget balsamic....that's my favorite for salads.|`|f7f1e87a5cc5f8233c3f6c867c28998aaa	Check foodtv.com or recipezaar.com to find some great recipes for the following wines    Wine Vinegar  As with wine , these vinegars can be red or white. The quality is determined by the type of wine used. Fine vinegars come from fine wine , and are made the slow , traditional way in oak barrels. They are matured in wood for periods ranging from a few weeks to one to two years. Red wine vinegars are aged longer than those made from white wine. The very best wine vinegars are made in relatively small batches , have fine balance and subtle, complex flavour. They are characteristically rich and mellow.     Commercially produced wine vinegars are of an inferior quality , using average wine and faster production techniques that remove a lot of the more subtle flavours in the wine. Many commercially produced wines are , none-the-less very good , and as with so many things , the price reflects the quality.       Champagne Vinegar  As to be expected , this vinegar is expensive , delicate , refined and gentle. Pale gold in colour , clear and bright. Wonderful stuff , but you wouldn't want to drink a glass of it on New Years Eve.       Sherry Vinegar  A very fine vinegar type. As with other wine vinegars , the best are very expensive and justifiably so. Sherry vinegars are made from a blend of wines , just like sherry , and are left to mature in the wood for a long time. They develop fat , rich flavour and a mellow complexity. Like traditional Balsamic vinegar , excellent Sherry vinegar occupies a special place outside the vinegar spectrum.       Balsamic Vinegar  Balsamic made the traditional way is an outstanding vinegar. Dark , almost treacly in colour , it is very smooth and mellow with deep complexity and layers of subtle flavours. The very finest Balsamics are made from the the juice of Trebbiano grapes that has been boiled down to almost a syrup. This reduction goes through a first natural fermentation in wooden casks that produces alcohol. A second fermentation , with the aid of the acetobacter bacteria in the air , creates the acetic acid that is vinegar. This vinegar is then filtered into wooden casks and left to mature for anywhere from 10 to 30 years. Some for even longer. Some Balsamics mature in a succession of casks all made from a different type of wood , each type giving a another layer of flavour to the vinegar. It is this almost magical combination of wood , wine and time that makes traditionally made Balsamic vinegar such a rare and very expensive delight.     Historically , Balsamic vinegar originated in Modena; a town in northern Italy. Commercially made Balsamic vinegar is made in the region as well and while nowhere near the quality of the traditionally made vinegar , it is very good and markedly different from other wine vinegars. Though produced on a large scale , most commercial Balsamics are left to mature in wood for varying lengths of time and develop the basic characteristics of the traditionally made vinegar.     Malt Vinegar  Made from a beer-like brew using malted barley , this vinegar is made by much the same method as for commercially produced wine vinegars. Good malt vinegar is left to mature for some time before being bottled.It has a strong flavour and medium acidity. Suitable only as a condiment or for pickling.    Cider Vinegar  Made from cider or apple mash in the same way as malt vinegar. It has a sharp strong flavour at full strength and the better quality ones dilute well to reveal a delicate apple flavour. It has a warm , soft honey colour. Although usually sold filtered there is a growing belief that unfiltered organic cider vinegar is especially beneficial to over-all health. Used as a condiment and for pickling. Very good for pickling fruit. When diluted it can be used for salad dressing.     Rice Vinegar  Usually made from fermented rice or rice wine. Originating in China and Japan. Chinese rice vinegars are stronger than those of Japan and range in colour from colourless ,through various shades of red and several shades of brown. Compared to other types of vinegar Chinese and, especially , Japanese vinegars are very mild; almost sweet.     Japanese rice vinegar is very mild and mellow and ranges in colour from colourless to pale yellow. There are two distinct types of Japanese vinegar; one made from fermented rice and the other is made by adding rice vinegar to sake.     White Rice Vinegar  This is a colorless liquid, higher in vinegar content and more similar in flavour to regular vinegar (every time I taste it I immediately envision a plate of salty French fries doused in vinegar). Nonetheless, it is still less acidic and milder in flavour than regular vinegar. There is also a hint of sweetness that comes from the glutinous rice. White rice vinegar can be used in stir-fries, particularly sweet and sour dishes, and for pickling. The best brand is Pearl River Bridge.     Black Rice Vinegar  Black rice vinegar is very popular in southern China, where Chinkiang vinegar, the best of the black rice vinegars, is made. Normally black rice vinegar is made with glutinous or sweet rice, although millet or sorghum may be used instead. Dark in color, it has a deep, almost smoky flavour. One word of warning: the quality of black rice vinegars varies strongly. I recently tried a brand where the caramel and sugar overpowered all the other flavours. Gold Plum's Chinkiang vinegar, made with glutinous rice, water and salt, is generally considered to be the best. Black rice vinegar works well in braised dishes and as a dipping sauce. It can also serve as a substitute for balsamic vinegar.     Red Rice Vinegar  This is another vinegar that is dark colored, but lighter than black rice vinegar. In any event, you'll never get the two mixed up once you have a taste - red rice vinegar is an intriguing combination of t

The reason I say that is because tap water has fluoride in it. And thats very high levels of fluoride. Excessive fluoride intake causes severe complications in the body. You already have fluoride in toothpaste, you don't need more.  Fluoride is scientifically recognized as a toxic poison.

Just google about the harms of fluoride. Tap water does not give you a choice, instead it FORCES you to drink fluoride. I believe every individual should have a choice, whether he/she wants to drink fluoride or not. I choose not to.    And its not just fluoride but tap water has been found to have lead, sediment and some impurities in it.    Drink spring water which is bottled. It is fluoride free, and is very cheap -- about 80 cents a gallon.

Heres an example of baking choclate.  http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51...|`|200f630432eb7a10b4eb96339e0c7d41aa	I clicked on your link. Yes, you are correct. "Unsweetened" means exactly that...there is no added sugar. Unlike commercial "hot chocolate mix" which has premeasured sugar already added, "unsweetened" cocoa powder allows the baker to add in their own desired amount of sugar or variety of sweetner (i.e. honey). That way the baker can not only control the sweetness of the baked goods but also the "bitterness" of the chocolate flavor.
CciXZNYraa	This is like the Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe !!!!  Trust me, it's really good !    2 cups all-purpose flour   1/2 teaspoon baking soda   1/2 teaspoon salt   3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted   1 cup packed brown sugar   1/2 cup white sugar   1 tablespoon vanilla extract   1 egg   1 egg yolk   2 cups semisweet chocolate chips     Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.   Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.   In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart.   Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted.

nmsnZ80Haa	I wouldn't use a lid on it.  When I do mine, I just put the rice and water into a plastic container (a lot bigger than the amount of food and water) and then I start cooking it.  I won't do it more than about 8 minutes the first go around, stir it, and the do it for another 5 to  8 minutes.  Usually it is done by this time.  You can't do it for the whole 20 minutes.  You have to stop it and stir it in between.  I hope this helps!|`|fAcVndo7aa	I know I'll probably get reamed for this by someone, but hey, I am the crazy Tupperware lady...    Tupperware makes containers specifically for "reheating" (although I've been known to actually - gasp - cook in them - shhh!) in the microwave.  They're called Heat 'n Serve, and they are designed to be microwaved with their lids on.  They have special vents that pop open to allow steam to escape when the pressure is too much for the container, without making the huge mess you get when your cooking "explodes".  Check them out here:  http://order.tupperware.com/coe/app/tup_...    Another great Tupperware solution is the Microwave Cooker, although it is a bit more pricey.  It does do great rice.  That one's here:  http://order.tupperware.com/coe/app/tup_...    Barring that, I suppose you could put plastic wrap or paper towels over the container to keep the dirty water from making a mess.    Another good tip to make cleaning the microwave easier:  toss in an uncovered container of water for a few minutes.  It will soften any residue in the microwave and make it easier to clean.|`|WTiMxoxFaa	yea u say u cant control it well ur taking a shower how bout this wait till after ur done with your shower and have some time on ur hands

Stir in salt and  the sugar. I use a large spoon for this. Next I add  the butter. My grandmother would melt the butter   in a pan over slow heat to make it blend easier.   You can do this or just let the butter soften at   room temperature. Add the eggs, whole. At this  point I break out my mixer and begin mixing on  slow. I slowly add my buttermilk, and then the  vanilla extract. After it is thoroughly stirred,  I turn the mixer up to medium for a few minutes,  and then finally on high. If the mixture is a little  thick I add just a touch more buttermilk. If you don't  mix things thoroughly you will have lumps that will   form air bubbles in your mixture and leave holes  in your finished cake. It was always a matter of pride   not to have these air pocket holes in our cakes so we   always made sure we got all of the lumps. In the   pre-electric-mixer day that involved a lot of whipping  the cake by hand. We usually didn't have a hand cranked   mixer  that worked well, so this involved a large mixing spoon  to whip it. Some old timers even counted the number  of times they whipped the mixture - sort of made it  fun and you didn't notice your arm tiring.    Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.     Take your standard tube cake pan and oil it with  butter. Then lightly flour the oiled pan. Shake   the excess flour from the pan.     Pour the mix in, bake the cake for about 1 hour  and twenty minutes. Keep looking at how your cake  is doing through the oven door but avoid opening  the door too much while it is cooking as I have  seen this, or jarring a cake, cause it to collapse.  When you think it is done, do the toothpick test.  Stick a wooden toothpick into one of the thickest  parts of the cake. If it's dry when you pull it our,   the cake is done.    Allow the cake to cool 15 or 20 minutes in the pan.  Then gently remove it, and stick it on your favorite  decorative cake plate.

Place 3 slices bacon on plate, cover with paper towel or wax paper and microwave about 1 or 2 minutes per slice turning over half way through cooking. Bacon will look under cooked but will continue cooking after removing from oven. In a soup bowl, buttered or sprayed with cooking spray, beat 2 eggs until smooth. Cook in microwave about 2 to 3 minutes stirring outer edges towards the center. Be careful because it is easy to over cook. Eggs will look wet but will continue cooking. These will be moist and fluffy. Enjoy

4qT0TfMZaa	That green is actually part of the potato skin.  It's okay to eat, as long as it's cooked.  It is mildly toxic when raw, but you'd have to eat several pounds of it a day for it to have much of an effect at all.  The eyes of potatoes are several times more toxic, but even that much toxin is pretty much destroyed by thorough cooking.  It's really a matter of taste - cooked potatoes look much more appealing if one removes the eyes and the skin with the green.  Unless, of course, you're doing baked potatoes with the skin on - I love those, too!    Just don't eat the potato vines or leaves - those'll make ya sick!|`|AA10629349	they are ok to eat, but i dont think they are quite ripe yet.  try keeping them in a dark place for a few extra days and that should help!!  good luck!
AA11225694	. Feed your head  Wine could preserve your memory. When researchers gave memory quizzes to women in their 70s, those who drank one drink or more every day scored much better than those who drank less or not at all. Wine helps prevent clots and reduce blood vessel inflammation, both of which have been linked to cognitive decline, as well as heart disease, explains Tedd Goldfinger, DO, of University of Arizona School of Medicine. Alcohol also seems to raise HDL, the good cholesterol, which helps unclog your arteries.    2. Keep the scale in your corner  Studies find that people who drink wine daily have lower body mass than those who indulge occasionally; moderate wine drinkers have narrower waists and less abdominal fat than people who drink liquor. Alcohol may encourage your body to burn extra calories for as long as 90 minutes after you down a glass. Beer seems to have a similar effect.    3. Boost your bodys defenses  In one British study, those who drank roughly a glass of wine a day reduced by 11 percent their risk of infection by Helicobacter pylori bacteria, a major cause of gastritis, ulcers, and stomach cancers. As little as half a glass may also guard against food poisoning caused by germs like salmonella when people are exposed to contaminated food, according to a Spanish study.    4. Guard against ovarian woes  When Australian researchers recently compared women with ovarian cancer and cancer-free women, they found that roughly one glass of wine a day seemed to reduce the risk of the disease by as much as 50 percent. Earlier research at the University of Hawaii produced similar findings. Experts suspect this may be due to antioxidants or phytoestrogens, which have high anticancer properties, in the wine. And in a recent University of Michigan study, a red wine compound helped kill ovarian cancer cells in a test tube.    5. Build better bones  On average, women who drink moderately seem to have higher bone mass than abstainers. Alcohol appears to boost estrogen levels; the hormone seems to slow the bodys destruction of old bone more than it slows the production of new bone.    6. Prevent blood-sugar trouble  Premenopausal women who drink one or two glasses of wine a day are 40 percent less likely than women who dont drink to develop type 2 diabetes, according to a 10-year study by Harvard Medical School. While the reasons arent clear, wine seems to reduce insulin resistance in diabetic patients.    7) The wine has the kind of alcohol that kills the "special" brain cells. The ones that are used when you dress plaid with stripes or buy that ugly green purse you realize is ugly only 3days after buying it. With the "special" brain cells out of the way you are free to use the better ones.    8) If your spouse/boyfriend/domestic partner is kind of, lets say, butt-ugly it can make pro-creation easier.    So, no, there is no problem unless you are weak enough to be a quitter!   Drink away and enjoy the extra  brain cells and other healthy benefits.    |`|5cLZlX30aa	No, not all all.  Some people have different tolerances for alcohol, and certain types of alcohol can do different things to people.  Some people can't drink beer because there is sooo much carbonation, it just makes them sick.  Everyone is different, nothing wrong with that.|`|AA11223319	Not really, if you have self-control.    If you don't, and you already have a high possibility of being an alcoholic, then I would consider it a gate-way drink; something to be careful of.    Think of it in terms of drugs, some people say they will only ever do marajuana, but when it stops working, they reach for the more powerful drugs.|`|U2BtL6KUaa	I have nothing helpful to contribute to this question, but I couldn't help but lol at your choice of wording :)|`|C4Sw8KBZaa	Uh...nobody would say that person has issues.

AA11525891	Yes and no. Urine evaporates or specifically the water (which is over 90%) in it does. Some of the waste products also convert to gases and rise into the atmosphere and some (like salts and minerals) are just left in the soil or where ever you left the urine. The water is somewhat purified and can fall back as precipitation just like the water from the ocean or a mud-puddle. Any of the waste products that do evaporate in theory could bind with water and fall with the rain. Acid rain is an example of atmospheric pollution causing rainwater to be acidic.|`|00a8352416947125cb4ac2d7a0a201c3aa	Yes.    And if you'll watch one of the desert episodes of "Survivorman" you'll see Wes urinate on the sand, then put a clear plastic cover over it and set it up so that the water collects in a cup.

wePTUmPkaa	Go for the taste. Moderation is the answer. Eat a balanced diet. Food with a certain amount of fat and salt is fine - especially the healthy oil/fat rather than saturated or synthetic [margarine].     If however your diet is full of fat, sugar and salt - change it. I cook with no salt - I use different herbs and spices to add flavour and the most salt I add is eg. soy sauce or maggi.     I find roasted salted cashews the best. The cashew, like any nut, contain oil and this presumably withdraws somewhat with roasting. Salt and fat is not such an issue as made out - I know plenty of people on cholesterol medication who eat almost no saturated fat and almost no salt. A lot depends on exercise and whether you eat a lot of take away or processed food. Processed food is full of sugar and salt, so you need to read labels - otherwise make everything rom the basics and treat items like cashews as a treat without overindulging....just shake the bag so majority of salt goes to bottom.|`|XdlsbLrLaa	Well for me, I have to watch my sodium so the salted would be a no no for me. Besides, I think natural tastes way better anyways. I suppose it's just personal preference but also look at everything, not just the grams of fat. ( Like I said, I have to watch sodium. )|`|A5m6P0FEaa	I'd get the salted/roasted.  The only thing to be careful about is not consuming too much sodium (salt).  The salt does not add any additional fat/carbs/protien|`|l8GqF6gjaa	Fat content will not change on roasting natural cashew nuts. The problem lies in consumption of salt. Eating salt is bad for kidney. Salted cashew nuts use lot of salt, like in potato wafers.When you take lots of roasted & salted cashew nuts, which are irresistable when taken with cold beer, you are asking for trouble.|`|lvwY0ZYcaa	I have to buy both. I'm really not a huge salt fan. On the other hand I have to get cashews salted for hubby because of his low blood pressure. Just depends if you want a lot of salt, lightly salted or no salt.|`|3gH7jFJGaa	the salt is where the problem is not the actual nut its self. try the roasted unsalted ones|`|3d2bd5deee3540ede736581cb7da08adaa	The nutrition is not compromised on a raw product.  On any product fruit vegetable, nut or bean, you loose nutrition when the product is cooked.  Most people eat roasted, or cooked products.  Health nuts (people)  vegans, and people looking for a cure, will often watch everything they eat and stick to raw organic products because of there nutritional value, (and lack of toxins).

1c19c917a8f43caf8f4545efc8aa39fbaa	The best way I've found to do it is to make up your favorite mac and cheese recipe (the traditional baked kind that is like a casserole, not the liquidy kind it won't work). Make a large batch and enjoy it fresh that night. The next day (for breakfast perhaps) Cut the left over casserole into wedges, dip each wedge in an egg dredge, and then coat with panko (Japanese) bread crumb (though normal will work fine). Then deep fry in oil. Since it's been cooked already you only need to fry it long enough to set up the outside and warm the inside.      Fried Mac and Cheese    * Peanut oil, for frying  * Flour, for dredging  * 1 egg, beaten  * Plain bread crumbs, for dredging  * -------------------  * 1 recipe "The Lady's Cheesy Mac  * and cut into 15 squares      Directions:    Heat 2 inches of oil in a large, heavy Dutch oven to 350 degrees F.    Dredge each Cheesy Mac square in flour, then egg, and then bread crumbs to coat. Fry for about 1 minute on each side until golden brown. Drain on paper towels before serving.    The Lady's Cheesy Mac:  4 cups cooked elbow macaroni, drained  2 cups grated Cheddar  3 eggs, beaten  1/2 cup sour cream  4 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces  1/2 teaspoon salt  1 cup milk    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    Once you have the macaroni cooked and drained, place in a large bowl and while still hot, add the Cheddar. In a separate bowl, combine the remaining ingredients and add to the macaroni mixture. Pour macaroni mixture into a casserole dish and bake for 30 to 45 minutes. Top with additional cheese, if desired.|`|tqD9xUpYaa	Are you looking for corn fritters that are deep fat fried?  Or fried mac & cheese - Paula Deen on FoodNetwork.com has a good recipe for this.|`|DFXS4SB4aa	Those are just fried macaroni. Bake up your favorite macaroni casserole, let it cool. Cut it into slices, bread it and fry it.     You want one with corn inside? Make up a really thick creamed corn, shape, bread, and fry.
fd75a8729219cb709ba73a843e3aef5daa	It is great when you mix it with lemonade and a bit of lime juice. Put it over ice and enjoy.

Make into small balls. Flatten two balls of dough into even size. On one flattened roti, place a slice of cheese or two, depending on the size of the roti.     Then place the other one on top of this and slowly roll down with a rolling pin. Put a little butter on a roti pan and then bake the roti. Make sure it is on slow heat.

OBA3Iciraa	it's ok to burn with a wok.  thats the way its supposed to look after time, it should have a black bottom to it.  Soak it in vinegar and baking soda overnight.  IF that doesn't work, boil the ingredients and loosen it with a wooden spoon.    Burnt food is a known carcinogen.  Carbon should be avoided.  Dont throw the pot out, just clean it properly.
t0vuwuGXaa	I know you don't want to hear that you shouldn't be drinking, but drinking at 14 is a recipe for disaster (and it's illegal).  Having said that, I will still answer your question:    160 proof refers to the alcohol content.  This means it is 80% alcohol.  Most liquor is in the 80-100 proof range, so the stuff you have is really strong.    It should taste awful, it's absinthe.  It's made from wormwood and is extremely bitter.  Most people pour it over a sugar cube and mix it with a little water to help it go down easy.    The stuff is really expensive, and I would suggest keeping the bottle around as a conversation piece instead of actually drinking it.  I've never met anyone who actually drinks the stuff and enjoys it.    It's only popular because it used to be illegal and had a stigma attached to it.  It's really nothing special.  It's kind of like tequila with a worm in it, a novelty.    The most important thing is to never drink and drive.  I'd suggest not drinking by yourself either in case you go overboard and need medical help.    Actually, just wait until you are 21!|`|7CouboDraa	For starters, you are 14, you shouldn't be drinking.  Secondly, the fact that you don't even know what 160 proof means, definitely says you shouldn't be drinking.    The reason it burns your throat and "tastes terrible" is because you are 14 years old and don't know how to drink.    Do yourself a favor, stop drinking before something bad happens to you, like becoming an alcoholic. You should wait til your twenty-one, but since kids will be kids, at least wait until your 17 or so if you're going to drink and if you're going  to (now or then) be safe about it. I've seen a lot of bad things come from drinking, especially young kids drinking. Drinking alone can be just as dangerous as drinking with friends.      Your brother was obviously wrong about your maturity and I have to question his maturity considering he bought a 14 year old boy strong alcohol.    My problem is a 14 year old kid drinking, especially since it is such a strong alcohol. Your brother was wrong, because you drank it. It doesn't make a difference if you got drunk off it or not. And yes it is supposed to taste nasty (I never said otherwise), hence why it is suggested that you add the sugar and water. It is rare that people actually drink it. As the person below said, you should keep it as a conversation piece, instead of drinking it. I felt no need to answer your questions, as it would only be encouragment for you to drink it.|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Absinthe isn't something that you slam down. Absinthe is a liquor made from various herbs, so it has a very complex flavor. It is best enjoyed by mixing with a bit of ice cold water, and *sipping.* There are a lot of boutique producers of absinthe in America that have started up since it became legal. But apparently, there is a lot of crappy absinthe sold in some parts of Europe.    Again, don't shoot absinthe. Sip it with ice water. I can't say how expensive it was, but probably quite a bit because it was on the Euro. Keep it around and enjoy a drink every now and then when you are feeling adventurous. As you know, the flavor is pretty strong, so why would you even want to drink it all at once?

moxrIqykaa	I have this problem all the time.   as for keeping things cooled--- only put out a small amount and use a glass or stainless steel tray or bowls. have the serving bowl on a tray of Ice  these need to be changed often also. Ice Chests with lots of Ice.    as for hot---- I use chafing dishes and also have hot boxes and pan saver liners that I use. I also use electric roasters when the ovens will not accommodate all the meat I need to prepare.  Go to your local restaurant supply store and tell them what you are planning on doing. they will help you get the proper supplies.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Yes. You can get some cold packs, and place them under a table cloth and set your serving containers on top of them. The serving containers should be very thin, aluminum trays covered in green leaf work well for this. Tubs with ice also work well and you can cover the tub with a table cloth and then put the ice in the container. Here is some options from bed bath and beyond, they carry a condiment tray and salad bowl with areas to put ice right in the container. You can also do this.  If you have a set of aluminum bowls, take washed green leaf leaves and cover the inside and leading to over the bowl, now fill with ice, take another bowl cover with the leaves and place the fruit in it. The metal will hold the temp well, the green leaf will hide the fact their aluminum bowls and look really pretty.  If your really into this. Take plastic containers and fill one to two inches of water and freeze. Get out and place on a bed one a tray, cover with greenleaf and place groups of cut fruits and veggies on that, the block will of course melt, placing it in a larger flat box or tupperware covered in greenleaf will cover the tupperware. You get the idea though right?? Sorry I dont explain things well.|`|qzY2tRTeaa	I have this problem all the time. as for keeping things cooled--- only put out a small amount and use a glass or stainless steel tray or bowls. have the serving bowl on a tray of Ice these need to be changed often also.

This means that the elegance disappears.  To keep the veggies and fruits cool , you need large bowls or just basins will do, to hold ice. Similar to a restaurant buffet in a hotel. Place all your fruit in nice serving bowls and place them on the bed of ice in as neat a display as possible. The key is to have lots of ice.  As for the hot meatballs and other hot foods.plug in a large electric frying pan or two and control it on low, fill them up  and cover to keep warm and flying insects out.  Another method to keep food warm is with stainless steel chafing dishes.  They are very handy when serving at buffets, and a good item to own. Thery can be heated with sterno fuel for long periods of time.
4Pk6VNftaa	Sure, why not?  Though whether it makes the cookie taste better will sort of depend on whether you like fondant or not.|`|IDgSVPBxaa	ROYAL ICING FOR SUGAR COOKIES       3 egg whites  1 lb. confectioners' sugar  1/2 tsp. cream of tartar  1/2 tsp. almond extract or white vanilla extract    Place all ingredients in bowl and beat on medium high for a full 10 minutes. Icing will become thick and glossy but will not increase in volume. Keep covered with damp cloth while using, removing small portions to bowl as needed. Tint if desired. To thin, add a few drops of water. Royal icing hardens with a nice sheen.
dM5a6Pm7aa	wooden spoons last forever, dishwasher safe, soap is okay, they'll be fine in the sink, and don't get hot like metal or go out of shape with heat like plastic.  Used for stirring e.g. soups, stews, rice dishes  and mixing e.g. baking mixtures, any other mixture!  They may get stained a bit if you use them for something like a tomato soup and then don't wash them straight away, but still work just fine and are safe to use.|`|da580af9e5114d80d24d6e1ac5858417aa	I do still use wooden utelsils, however, I do let them sit in a water/bleach solution for a few minutes if I use them while cooking meats (in which case I usually opt for plastic or metal, depending upon my pan).    Here's a great article on this topic ;)    "Can I use a wooden spoon utensil when cooking chicken?    The key food safety hazard is bacteria, which is naturally present on the raw chicken and will contaminate the wood spoon. "Is a wooden spoon or utensil more prone to contamination than are non-wooden utensils, such as plastic or food-grade metal?" NO. The general recommendation is one should use food preparation utensils that are constructed from hard wood. Hard woods can withstand deterioration due to moisture and are also less prone to splitting, cuts, etc. The bottom line is that they will be easier to clean. Soft woods can be used in home food preparation but are much more difficult to maintain and clean. The key for using any utensil (wood or non-wood) is you do not want a utensil that has been in contact with raw meat to come in contact with a cooked or ready-to-eat food. This would be a source of cross-contamination. HOWEVER, if the same utensil is used during the cooking process (and comes in contact with the hot food, such as stirring the pot while the food is cooking), the bacteria on the utensil would be killed because it would be exposed to the heat of the food during cooking. Therefore, using a utensil in this manner is not a food safety hazard. It would be a food safety hazard if the utensil was used for placing raw food onto a grill and then the same unwashed utensil was used to remove the cooked food from the grill. The utensil surfaces would not have been exposed to temperatures that could kill the bacteria on it. Thus, the bacteria could re-contaminate the cooked food.    PREPARED BY: Angela M. Fraser, Ph.D., Associate Professor/Food Safety Specialist, NC State University in July 2004"|`|bf5cDEyZaa	Wooden spoons are fine for all kinds of food. They are much better than plastic or metal. Plastics are weak and metals can ruin your pots.  They can be washed in the dishwasher, with dishwasher detergent, or can be hand washed with dish soap. I would not leave them in the sink for very long, it is best to clean them right away. Old, rotting food has bacteria, which can start a nice little colony on your utensils.   If your dishwasher doesn't get very hot, you might want to soak your wooden spoons in vinegar every once in a while. This is a good disinfectant, also removes food stains. Standing them in boiling water also resolves the bacteria concern.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	To be honest - I stopped using any wooden utensil in the kitchen.  I don't know how they could be considered food safe since they are so porous.    They tell us not to use wooden cutting boards because they cannot be sterilized - they don't allow wooden food surfaces in commercial kitchens any more - so I don't know how a wooden spoon could be used in a food-safe manner - except for bleaching in between uses.    I think they are relics.  they are more expensive than plastic, metal or silicone and you know you can adequately clean those.    I'll probably get hate male from the wooden spoon council - - and every housewife who says they have been using them for years and never got sick - but for me and my family, we just aren't going to risk using them.
