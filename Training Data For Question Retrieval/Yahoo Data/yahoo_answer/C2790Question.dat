20090221003813AAT9cI4	Dining Out;Fast Food	How are Jack in the Box tacos made?	I've eaten many tacos from Jack in the Box in the past (the 2 for a dollar).  It seems like since two are included in every order, they wouldn't bother having a crew member assemble them as they're ordered, or even ahead of time.  Are they delivered to the restaurants frozen and then just deep fried, then maybe the lettuce, etc., are added?  It doesn't seem like they'd make each and every one from separate toppings by hand.
