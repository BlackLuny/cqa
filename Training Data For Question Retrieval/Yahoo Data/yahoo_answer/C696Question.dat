20090226095742AAT8449	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you call this flirting (read conversation)?	I noticed that my bf must have been having a convo with this girl he goes to school with (we go to diff schools) on his facebook page. I could only see one half of the conversation of course, but here it is, and would you call this flirting?      (These are all of her comments, and he was answering in between, but idk what he said).      -(his full name), I shall always yell at you to pull up your pants if it puts a smile on your wonderful face :B      -(his full name)! WHAT BLASPHEMY!!    Your face is completely wonderful. And it was hilariously funny. I, in fact, enjoyed it greatly.         -(his full name) stop being such a loser and realize that I speak the truth. So deal with it. Geeze! :)      -Yeah, well your role model is probably poop since you're acting like it right now :P      I'm such a five year old, (his full name).      -I guess I'll take that as a compliment.    And yeah, i store up the maturity for when I'm around adults. But otherwise, I'm about as mature as a little kid who just heard the word boobies.       -Yes, you are rather stubborn. :D   And yes. Boobies, says I.       -I know you so well :D haha

20090226100059AAc2zc6	Family & Relationships;Family	Serious question: I need help with my in-laws :) ?	Okay, here's the story: My husband's mom is totally consumed in her daughter's life and likes to tell us every detail of her marriage. Never talks about anything else, and you would never guess that she has a life at all except living vicariously through her daughter's drama. Kept calling us and telling us everything, how she just wants her daughter to get divorced and take her husband's money...bla bla bla.       So my husband told his sister's husband what his mom was saying. Kind of bad, I think, except his mom is a gossip queen, and whenever she would talk to us about her daughter, she would run back and tell her daughter everything we said, and turn it into something bad. EVIL.      Now everyone is mad at my husband, I THINK. His sister is, she blames him that she is getting divorced (well, she is usually getting divorced every other month, and then gets back together with the guy).       I think that everyone just needs to talk to eachother and not let this drag on without talking about it. I don't want to have a family that doesn't talk to eachother! Should I call one of them and talk to them about it? Or just leave it alone?
20090226100357AAaYE8t	Family & Relationships;Family	How do i get them off of my case about it?	so another college friend of mine just got married. when my parents found out about it they gave me an earful and none of it was pleasant to the ears. they're very traditional folks, and they regard my lack of a marriage prospect as a disgrace. i'm 26 btw. the girl who just got married is a year younger than me and had only dated her hubby for a year and a half. i've been dating my bf for over three years now but i have no intention of marrying him any time soon given that i am still a student right now, and also that honestly, i don't have high hopes for an interracial marriage (he's white, i'm asian).      now dont get me wrong, im crazy about my bf (i knew him from high school and had a crush on him ever since) but at times, i feel that my parents are more in love with this guy than i am, CONSTANTLY reminding me to hold on to him and saying cold and even nasty things about me (most of the time to my face!) whenever i feel like giving up on our relationship. once i told them maybe i don't ever want to get married, they jeered at me and called me a failure, saying old folks their age should already be having grandkids. damn asians and their family values. i'm so f*cking sick of it all.      i want to get the parents off of my back for good about my life and how THEY think i should live it. how do i do it without being rude to them? i've lost count how many times i've tried talking to them but it all ended with them showering my face with their spits and calling me young and stupid. i'm still a student right now and would like to focus on my career first (all of my sense of self-worth now depends on it!!!) but it's hard to stay positive when these parents of mine manage to turn every wedding invitation that i receive from my friends into verbal abuses against me. it makes me so sad sometimes i just wish i can go to sleep one night and never wake up.....

20090226100129AA81uL1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this guy???...I will answer your questions in return. THIS IS LONG?	I need to sum this up in a nutshell. This guy have taken a course with me a year ago and just last semester he walked up to me and asked me when am I going to be his girl. I took it as he was joking. He started to come over everyday and chill with me and watch tv until we fall asleep but I will wake up even if its 4 in the morning and make him leave. A couple of weeks went by and he started to stay overnight and even go to class from my room. Anyways we started to really like each other. It was a month and a half before we started to have sex. He was not so experienced but I like to accept someone how they are so I didnt judge him. He was comfortable around me. He always told me about his ex that cheated on him and he had nothing but bad things to say about her. I still had my guard up because I know that it might not have been over. His season started to play ball and we were still talking. But nothing official. I started to like him....alot. Over the break we asked eachother to not mess with other people. I did not.       When we came back off Christmas break things were cool. One day he came to my room and said he didnt want me to like him so hard. Right then i knew i had to put my guard back up except it would be harder because I knew feelings tried to break through. But he continued to show more interest. His roommate even told my roommate not to tell me that he was starting to have feelings for me but he did not know what to do. He went home that very weekend. He texted me.....Always calling me his sweet Angel....but he had some news and he dont want to hurt me. He told me he and his ex was getting back together. WTF I was pissed. For the first time I did not curse a guy out. I remained calm(around him) and played it cool although I was sad. I stayed in my room until 2 days later when we had a game that I went to. He watched me the whole time at his game. He even called me over that night to talk but he said he really just wanted to see me. He asked to hang out with me constantly and his fellow players thought he and I still talked because he didnt tell any of them about his ex. So that was about over a month ago. He asked to take me to the mall and pick out his clothes. Every once in a while he would urge to get fresh with me then would say I cant i have a girlfriend. That would always kill my high although i never showed it. He would always text me and see what I am doing. So basically he had me so confused and when we would have a heart to heart he would always say that he is so confused and he do not know what to do but he felt like he made the biggest mistake when choosing to get back with her. I always ignored it and labeled it as bull because otherwise he would not be with her.       Recently I texted his phone to tell him im not coming over because it was raining. SHE texted me back saying So you are the girl that he is talking to and she asked me to never text his phone again. I was mad. He blew my phone up that night beggin to talk to me and apologize. He was scared to lose me. Well....things havent been the same since but he talked to me and said he was so confused but he still want me to be in his life. He came over one day and things got heated....I never made him cheat though. He told me that night that they had broken up. He would rub on me and kiss my shoulders. But other times he would act hard all of a sudden around his friends but soft up and say yeah you know i like you. He always wants me near him and would not even let me get up to brush my teeth without knowing or get texts without asking who it was from. He actually put it on me the other day and I put it right back on him. But I have been ignoring him a little to see what his intentions are. He is hiding his feelings like I am but I dont know what to do about him. Let him go or not? Or what??? Please help me out!!!!!

But i suggested something a little more complex. For example, if you were in the Twin Towers right before that plane would crash and you knew that it was going to happen, what would you say to the people who are about to die or what would you do in the few minutes before the plane would crash? Sorry if this brings up any hurt feelings or for those who have lost anyone. :( im sorry. But things like these situations, any situation that had made history, what would you do, say, or try to prevent?

20090226101035AAsmyfI	Family & Relationships;Friends	I ended our friendship?	Recently my guy friend has been acting really odd around me at work. He barely talks to me and he barely looks at me. We used to be completely opposite of that. We talked and laughed as good friends would do. He has got me thinking that I did something to offend him so one day I sent him a message asking him if I had done anything that had upset him or made him mad and he denied it but then asked me how I was doing. After that I was like well ok maybe it was just a little phase. I thought that until a couple of days ago when I was standing right beside him and he didn't look or speak to me. It was like I didn't exist to him and he knew I was there because other people had said hey to me. He used to always tell me hey at least. So anyway I talked to one of my friends today and she told me that his girlfriend has some kind of grudge against me. I was furious but all the pieces came together. I sent him another message saying that I am deleting his number and his myspace and told him what I had heard and that I believed it was true and that I wish him the best in life. He definitely receieved the message but he didn't even reply. What do you think is going on? Why do you think he didnt reply? What do you think will happen?

20090226101939AARtamS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question about Man/Woman Friendships.?	I have a long story that I will condense here but am curious to see what people think or if there are any ways to make this friendship work.  I have a friend (one of my best friends) that I have known very well for 15 years (we are both 30-ish).  I was in love with the guy when we were younger and my best friend asked him out knowing how I felt.  And now she is married to him with kids and her and I are no longer friends even though him and I have remained friends.  They are having problems and he has even went as far as to say he picked the wrong person and now seems to want to talk (and confide everything in me)and hang out with me quite a bit ---as a friend.  I want to be a friend to him, but have to admit that every time I try to be the friends we used to be I end up with all those feelings again (which is annoying after 15 years) and don't know if there is any option that we are both going to be happy with.  I always seem to end up on the hurt end of this although he does not mean to hurt me I know, but it still happens that way. Any suggestions?  I don't know if I can handle being friends with him but at the same time he is one of the best ones I have ever had and don't know how I can end that friendship permanently either.  Help!  Any thoughts?  Thanks for any, because I have been going over and over this and can't find one.

Lets just say hospitals could give a newborn baby girl an extremely painful procedure to keep pubic hair from ever growing, because some see it as more hygienic and more appealing to the opposite sex, would you have it done to your baby girl? Or let her grow up and decide for herself?      Many cut boy's foreskin off in a painful procedure because they believe it to be more hygienic and more appealing to the opposite sex. Others say, "Hey, it's his body, he should get to decide when he is older."

Not that I think he cant still carry on relationships with other girls. The thing is, I'm super jealous when he has another girl around him.  How can I keep myself from falling in love with him?

20090226102502AAyQ7kV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Bf broke up w/ me, now he wants revenge on me?	my ex and i dated for a litte over a year. he broke up with me because he didn't want to be tied down anymore. it's been about a month since we broke up and we have the same friends so we were at the same party last week. he was flirting & grinding on girls and i also met a guy and this guy kissed me during the party. then this guy walked me to my car and went back to the party. now, rumor has spun all around that i went home with this guy and slept with him and had crazy wild sex.      my ex thinks i did this to spite him. and now i hear he is plotting along with my "friends" to spite me back. there is a party on friday and they are planning to move the location without telling me so i show up like a dummy. however, i wasn't even planning on hanging out with them this weekend. i have other plans with the guy i met at the party. and now he is trying to go after another girl to make me jealous, basically just using her.       i'm not jumping into bed with anyone. in fact, the only guy i've been with intimately is my ex. i feel like my ex should know that i'm not dirty like that, and my "friends" should know that about me too. but they are choosing to believe all this nonsense. i haven't talked to anyone. i just hear this from my friend/insider. none of them have the courage to confront me yet are scheming against me. and he broke up with me!! i hate that he is getting so worked up over something that NEVER happened. i didn't go home with anyone, or do anyone.       what should i do? this is so ridiculous and yet somehow i feel bad that maybe i did someting wrong...? somehow he can grind and flirt with girls and move on but if i move on then it's bad?
20090226103136AAtL1w4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am in the 'friend zone' with this girl?	So, I've been talking pretty frequently with this girl for the last couple weeks. We went out last Friday, and spent pretty much the entire evening together. She was unsure if it was a date or hanging out, so I told her it could be whatever she wanted to be. She said that "we won't call it anything."      She had gotten out of a year+ long relationship about a month and a half ago. We flirt with each other, and she seems really interested in me, but I'm pretty sure she's not ready to date anyone right now.      So, am I on a one way ticket to the friend zone? How can I avoid it?
20090226103450AAgNaGg	Family & Relationships;Family	What can I do for my mom to say sorry?	So basically, we had dinner and then my brother cleared up. Every Thursday she has a drink for half an hour with my uncle, and she asked me to sit with my little sister until she'd finished eating.       I said "oh great, i have to sit with her whilst you go for a drink?" and she got cross and said "fine, don't bother, I do a lot for you! just don't bother!"       a few minutes later when she was leaving i said "i'm sorry mom" and she said "don't bother".      I know she's still quite cross. What can I do to say sorry? It's 6.30PM here at the moment so I can't go buy her flowers or anything. What should I do? I'm 14 and a teenage girl by the way.

I think my fiance and I should arrange a dinner at our apartment and invite the parents to meet for the first time.

20090226102719AAFE9uX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I hot enough for this girl I am dating? I need ladies' opinion?	have been on 4 dates so far with a 29 year old girl who is 6 years older than me. Made out with her this Satuday for 45 mins in my car at midnight. She is a cute girl with a nice body, and was very willing during kissing. HOwever, I'm worried that I might not be cute and sexy enough during sex. I am 5'7 weighing 130 pounds, so kinda skinny, with no such huge muscles. She says she likes me, but I'm worried that she might get turned off once we start having sex. What do you girls think? Do you care about the guy's body and sexiness after liking him?
20090226102327AAKzQ9K	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is he worth my time? (Sorry if too detailed)?	I grew up not knowing my father until I was 12 years of age. When I first met him I felt like I was his little angel and he was some sort of hero that was now going to look after me and make everything ok. I was wrong. He started seeing my mother behind my back and everything got out of control. He began coming down only to see her and forgot I even existed. My mother who had been a really good parent up to this point also started to push me out and the 2 of them forgot about me. I was often left to mind my younger half brothers and sisters and feed them. I began to get ill from being so upset. I often tried to kill myself by taking overdoses but then told someone because I couldn't leave my brothers or sisters alone in the world.    My father started telling my mother I was a brat who was trying to make everyones life hell unable to see that I was truly upset. Or maybe he could see but just didn't care. He told her to beat me so she began doing that. She kicked me and punched me and pulled my hair and continued hitting me while I was curled into a ball on the ground. Once it happened on the road in my estate with people I knew watching. Everytime this happened I refused to cry because my father was into being tough and I wanted to make him proud and not let him see me cry though often he was standing there watching her and I would wonder why my new daddy who was meant to protect me was letting her hurt me so bad!    Things went badly for them and my mothers partner came back after having a baby with someone else and my dad got jelous and started trouble for them. He took me to stay sometimes but would mentally abuse me telling me it was my fault they weren't together even though they'd broken up when I was 2 because she was 19 years of age and terrified when he would beat her. Once he wanted to see her so badly that he called her and said she had to come and collect me. She refused so he drove me to a place quite far from my home and left me on the side of the road for her to find me. I was 12. My mother who was having her dinner called her friend and asked her to get me because she wanted her dinner. Its now 4 years later and my father only calls on special occasions and still gives me grief. I feel pushed out by both of them and everything that happened in the past seems to be forgotten about though it still haunts me. Am I being a spoilt brat and over-reacting the way they tell me I do or are they in the wrong?   Should I forget about my "wonderful" dad altogether and move on?

My girlfriend and I broke up after 4 years together, recently she has been talking alot (and I as well) about marriage, kids, the heavy stuff.  We also got into a fight about abortions, 2 days later she broke up with me.  She has been hanging out with 2 girls in college that are not good influences, one dates a convicted fellon, and the other just tried to kill herself.  They hate me because I dont like them.  She told me that her friends made her think and she doesnt love me anymore.  Keep in mind we are BEST friends, ands she is a very loving person.  Neither of us have ever dated other people before.  Ive talked to her parents and her cousin (who is very close to the both of us) and they seem to think that her loving me is not the case,  I never see her anymore becuse we commute an hour to college, and she decided to get a dorm room when she broke up with me.

Then one day he told my best friend he just wanted to be friends. So for a while we didn't mention it and things went back to normal. Then a few days later i was sitting at lunch as usual and he came and sat next to me. I wasn't overly surprised because him and his friends always sits at the same table with us. Then some of them started teasing him and saying he liked me back and everything. He just blushed and kept eating. I am so confused about if he does  like me back or not.

You guys have kept in touch, you just havent seen eachother. When you see her for the first time in a while, she's put on a few lbs. You're use to seeing her thin, but now she's average and has some weight. Not fat, just weight. Are you disappointed?

Last year:      She like always say hi when she sees me .(SHE GAVE ME A NICKNAME ITS NOTHING BAD JUST MY NAME SHORTENED AND ALWAYS CALLS ME BY IT)..    In Class last year if the teacher calls my name she would turn around look at me and smile and even now she still doesSometimes she would tell me she loves me but i wasnt sure if shes serious because her friends say it to. We talk mostly on msn and barely at school, but her and her friends always get excited when i show up. We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      This Year:      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop one day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np. And when I got on the bus her & her best friend saved me a seat.       Today I passed by her two different times and both times 2 different guys had there arms around her. Should I just give up on her

20090226111220AAcP4mS	Family & Relationships;Friends	Any (preferably tactful) ways to let someone know she's an intrusion?	My girlfriend has a friend who always hangs out with her. Lately I've a problem with this friend because she is depriving me of time alone with my girl, and I sure appreciate that. To make matters worse, she's brutally insensitive to my need for couple time. I shan't rant about what this friend did, but suffice to say I'm pretty angry at her.      I don't want to be a jerk towards her, but I will if this keeps going on - which entails being blunt and forceful when she crashes our dates. Until then, how can I hint strongly that I need my girl to myself when the time comes?

20090226110810AAcoz9p	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I send ashes from the UK to Australia?	Could anyone please help me with this. My Father-in-Law died recently and he wanted his ashes to be scattered off the coast of Western Australia.   His son lives in Perth so there is no problem once he is out there, the problem seems to be in getting him there.      We asked at the local Post Office who gave us a number to ring. That got us through to Royal Mail, who passed us on to Parcel force, who did not know if they were allowed to send them because of custom restrictions.       I have searched on the internet and cannot find an answer as to whether sending human ashes is allowed and if so who does it and how do we go about actually sending them.      Has any one any experience of doing this?
20090226104610AA6QYJS	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What is the deal with people asking for money for wedding gifts?	Is this some kind of accepted practice nowadays?  I recently was invited to a wedding.  The invitation had a cutsey poem in it which basically said "We want money, not presents".  To top it off, the wedding is in a foreign country at an extremely posh resort.        Some people (that would be me) can't afford cash gifts for weddings.  I try and find nice things on sale or clearance that are within my budget yet that is still something the bride and groom want or would appreciate.        Am I crazy, or is it incredibly tacky to ask for money?  I thought wedding gifts were just that - gifts!  Not order fulfillment.
20090226105502AAjj6Kh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Gentlest way to break it off with an easily enraged guy?	Quick background- I have been dating a guy for 6 months now. He is smug and snobby yet very insecure. Treats me like gold, then puts me down a bit. When he drinks he has crazy mood swings.   Event- Went out clubbing, Night turned bad. I made an inncoent comment that set him off (completely not meaning to-implied he was not tall- he hates being shorter and took it as an attack- I like shorter guys and meant no harm). He drove us home drunk and had a few fits with yelling, swearing, hitting the steering wheel while yelling and forcefully grabbed my cell phone from me. A few times demanding I get out of the car (20miles from home) because I had displeased him. (more events of the night left out 7am he fell asleep)The next day he treated me like gold. I am having a hard time getting over it. He told me if I had not set him off with my comments it would not have occured, also said he is stressed. He vows not to drink. Personally I think it may be a sign of deeper issues.   Is this justification enough to break it off. And how do I do this so he will not have a rage fit.

20090226111244AA3g8lW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think my fiance cheating on me?	Okay so we use to see each other almost everyday and we just couldn't get enough of each other. Then, he got out of school and started working full time and moved two cities away. No big deal, I was and still am very proud of him and happy for him. We missed each other all the time then because we only saw each other on weekends.   Now everytime I talk to him on the phone, he either doesn't act like he  wants to talk or he is a jerk to me. He always goes to his buddy's house for hours. I don't mind that during week days. It's fine. But on weekends lately he has been going there before I go to bed and stuff and it makes me feel bad because I only see him for 2 days a week. We argue all the time when we are at his house and when we do he always acts like he's going to leave the house. Sometimes he does. He just leaves me there crying. He goes to Hooter's all the time for lunch at work and it bothers me how often he goes there.    Last night, we got into an arguement over the phone and he said he was going out. When I asked where he was going, he wouldn't tell me.    I said sorry to him because he was blaming me and I was sick of fighting (although he kept being a jerk). Then I asked where he was going and he said to a bar. He isn't even old enough to drink. It just really makes me wonder sometimes.

20090226105656AAOrWfL	Family & Relationships;Weddings	My cousins never invited me to their weddings, but my mom wants me to invite them to mine. Should I have to?	The only wedding I've been to of a cousin is when I was really little and she needed a flower girl, and I happened to be the only girl the right age. That cousin has been married twice since and I wasn't invited to either of those.       None of my other cousins have ever invited me to their weddings either. They're mostly way older than me, and the "younger cousins" weren't invited.      Now I'm getting married and my mom really wants me to invite them. I'm not close with any of them and my fiance barely knows them at all. I rarely ever see them and when I do, I still don't spend any time with them, but they hang out together on a regular basis (I'm never invited). I'm sure most of them don't even know what I do for a living. I'm trying to keep the wedding small, and inviting them (and their spouses) will make my family outnumber my fiance's by 4 times!      I keep trying to say no, but my mom keeps pressuring me. The only reason I'm not saying no outright is that my parents are paying for a lot of the wedding.. so I know they're supposed to get a big say.      So should I stick to my guns and say no, or should I give in and invite them even though I really don't want to?

20090226110449AALXIP9	Family & Relationships;Weddings	When is, in your opinion the best time to propose? Woman Please READ and HELP!?	I have already asked this questions. However though, I think my g/f uses yahoo anwers so now I have to go into stealth mode.      So we know. She is going to say YES! for sure! April 5th is the day we met. You met on a party bus. Talk for a little while, exchanged phone numbers and that was about it. My idea for the 5th of April would be to take her and our dogs...We have three dobermans, I would have a back pack with a sheet and some food and wine,. the beach it would be a quite, no body around beach. I want to get there a half hour or so before sunset....and as we walk the beach I want to pretend i just seen somethin sparkling in dirt and to her surprise I would have the ring in my hand. tell her why I love her and then ask her to marry me.      Next on my idea list. Is the day we started to hang out and get to know each other. 26th of July. I took her to a beach on my wave runner and we had a BLAST!!! We had so much fun and we always talk about. She likes to bump me off my wave runner....so what I want to do is go back to that same beach....ride the waver runner....first though I would have the ring competely secured to me via a floating lanyard and key chain type ring on the engagement rings its self. I WILL NOT LOSE IT. So when I fall of the waver runner and she comes back for me...I am going to ask her for her hand to help me up as she reaches out for me I want to (hopefully her left hand) I want to slide the ring half way onto her hand and tell her why I love her so much and then ask her to marry me....then put the ring all the way on her hand.      My next idea is the day we went exclusive. Aug 10...but really I guess Aug 12th. You last year when we had the meator shower....me and her snuck into a park with a huge hill over looking the sky, it was beautiful! and as we are on the hill around midnight and i want to agian tell her how much I love her and ask her to marry me.   One prob though... I am very antsy to do this I want to ask her today but I know it wont be as special as the dates mentioned above. Is anytime really a good time or would you woman prefer it to be more specail like the dates I have specified?      So...April 5th, July 26th or Aug 10...maybe 12th.      Thank you for all your input! I will be deleting these questions tomorrow...Just in case...

I love her to bits and although there has been rough times in our lives, she has tried her best to give the the best life possible. I know that she has. Recently I went abroad on a school trip that my grandmother paid for me to go on. I texted my mother everyday to keep her updated on how my holiday was going and to let her know I was safe. Everything seemed good while I was away. We had a good relationship. Since I've come home she's been at my throat 24/7 and telling me how much happier she was while I was away and the atmosphere in the house was so much better. I don't know what I've done on her because I've just been in my room watching telly and helping her with the kids and being at school and football training. I admit I snap at her sometimes when she asks me stupid questions about my conversations with my friends because she's nosy and I hate nosiness. Apart from that I think she only isn't happy with me being here because when she looks at me she see's my father who she hates. When we're having dinner she puts her hands up over the side of her face so she doesn't have to look at me. She's even asked me to rent a sublet with some friends and get out of her way but I'm only 16. I'm too young to leave home and don't want to leave my brothers and sisters yet. Please help me. Why is she making me feel guilty for things I don't even know I've done?

20090226110835AArSEAa	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I be sure my dying mom knows i love her?	My parents are both in their 80's.  My mother has been "dying" off and on for over 30 years.  She's had one serious illness after another, and we've been grieving off and on every time she is near death.  My father is mean, and very controlling.  She was in the hospital a long time a few years ago and he battled with the nurses and technicians, telling them they weren't doing things right and second-guessing everything. He took her out of a nursing facility against medical advice about 5 years ago when her prognosis was very bad and she wanted to die at home.  Yet she went on and on.  They didn't allow visiting help because they didn't want a "stranger" in the house. I'm about 45 minutes away but disabled and can't run back and forth easily, nor can I do any lifting.  I also cannot be around my parents as my father verbally abuses me and that upsets my mom.  He does the same to her.  My father always blames and snaps at my brother and I, so we pretty much stay away even though we miss our mother.  She's incontinent, weak, has all sorts of physical failings, but mentally present.  It got where my father stopped telling her when I call, and refused to give her the phone.  He told me she doesn't want to speak to me, yet in the past she has called me whenever she got a chance when he left the house for a few minutes.   He just goes on about how miserable he is, although he chose to take total control.  The doctor told him insurance would cover in-home care and he declined, then he tells me how horrible it is and he has no life.  Now, we think she is really dying.  I went to see her 2 days ago, and my father was verbally abusive towards me, minimizing that I could possibly be feeling as horrible as he does because i'm not there all the time.  I'm not supposed to grieve or cry, because i couldn't be as miserable as he is.  She should be in a hospital now, she's in constant pain, too weak to sit up, wearing a diaper, refusing to eat and just wanting to sleep.  She's all swollen up everywhere with water.  My dad is very short with her and i saw her cringe when he snapped at her.  This was a couple days ago, he said nothing can be done until a particular doctor sees her and admits her.     No suggestions I give him are listened to, he has an excuse why every one is impossible.  It has to be his way only.   Me, I want to be with my mother.  If she gets into a hospital, I can visit her there in the middle of the night when my dad isn't there or is sleeping.  I know it's a messed up situation but this has been our family's way since I was a child.  He acted like he had to protect mom from us demon children or something.  He always told us we are "killing" her.  Still seems that way.   It's driving me crazy.  I'm beginning to hate him.   What can i do?

20090226104030AAdnEy6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i change her mind about me?	Ok so I took this girl on a date, we had been talking for a while(school, texts,etc.) so i think that things are goin well, and she seems like she had a good time on the date. Then about during that week at school she starts to become a little distance and responds to my texts with one word. I come out and ask her whats the deal, and she says that she doesnt see us working because i'm not serious enough. I'm caught completely off guard and the only thing i can think of that would lead her to that conclusion is that when we text we act "joke-y" i just thought that was our little "flirting". How to i win her over and prove to her that i'm not just a clown, and that i really am interested in her and want to try again?

20090226105924AAzxaJm	Family & Relationships;Family	I need help about my family! I can't live with them anymore!?	For as long as I can remember, my parents have been extremely overprotective. And while I know that means that they care about me, some of it is just ridiculous! I am 17 years old, and they will not let me do anything! I cant go to a friends house, because "they would just prefer that people came to our house"  I can not go off campus during lunch, and its just really dumb.               The worst was last night- My parents decided that they were going to take away my driving priveledges, because my sister and i had a small argument that morning.  Then my father accused me of taking the car out in the middle of the night.  Then yelled at my sister and I about being upset about all of this.  Then threatened to take my cell phone just because it was ringing.  I just cant take it anymore! I want to ask my best friend if i can live with her when i turn 18 (in 3 more weeks), which i am sure they will say yes.  But can my parents do anything about it? and am i overreacting? Please help!
20090226110001AAiNWDg	Family & Relationships;Family	How should I deal with my step-mother-in-law?	My fiance's family and I have a long, drawn out history. We have been together for over three years, and he moved to Ohio from Wisconsin a year into our relationship. We've been living together quite happily ever since. However, his father and step-mother, with whom he lived before we moved in together, were not happy with the move.       A year ago, FIL and girlfriend got married. The day after my little sister was graduating from high school. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. The two events were 1100 miles apart. As soon as I learned of the problem, I called and apologized for the inconvenience and even offered to take a bus up the night after my sister's graduation, which I was told not to do. My fiance went to the wedding, and I went to my sister's graduation, calling the day of the wedding to offer congratulations and apologize again for not being able to attend.      The other point of contention is this: when my fiance moved in with me, I was still in undergrad, whereas now I am in graduate school. we had originally planned to move closer to his family for grad school, but I was offered a much larger, and better scholarship at a much more prestigious school in Ohio. Since that would allow us to stay close to my family, remain in an apartment we love and keep our pets, as well as saving us over $50000 over the course of a 3 year program, we decided to stay. Well, now my mother in law has decided I manipulated my fiance into moving here and never had any intention of moving closer to them. That simply is not true. To make matters worse, at my graduation party(my sister and I had a joint party as I graduated from college 2 weeks later), my fiance's father and step mother showed up and she confronted me in front of my whole family and all of my friends, completely ruined our party, and then left, without staying for my graduation as planned, or spending any time with their son.      Now they're coming to visit for the first time in 18 months, and my fiance's step mother refuses to stay with us because she says I am childish and immature. I have no idea how to handle this situation. I've extended an invitation to them both to stay with us, and have gone so far as to gather information and plan activities. I tried the same thing on our last visit to their house, and his step mother did not speak one word to me for three days.      Any advice on how to deal with my evil mother in law? Or should I just plan on being elsewhere for their visit? I want to make it work for the sake of my fiance and our relationship, but I'm honestly drawing a blank.

20090226134435AA9tmyf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys do you think its fair..?	to be a complete jerk to your girlfriend just because your in a bad mood even though she didn't do anything to you?  apparently my boyfriend had a bad day and i called him and was being nice.  I was like hey babe, whats up? and hes like nothing you? and im like not much just got home and then he starts giving me an attitude about everything. hes like "well thats just f*cking awesome for you isnt it?" and i could tell he was in a bad mood then so i didn't want to piss him off any more than he already was.       so i kept my answers to a minimum and then he started getting mad at me for not talking even though he was answering me in a mean way every time and told me to talk cause he isnt just going to sit there. so i told him to call me back when he calms down because he was in a bad mood but i hadn't done anything and i said goodbye. and he got all pissed even more.      when i am pissed off and i cant be nice i tell him ill call him back when i calm down, out of respect and to save myself the trouble of feeling guilty. i mean we are only 15 but still. i know boys dont think like that though, but..      do you think this was fair to me? and if it were you would you have just talked to me at a better time?

20090226124905AATIhPp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How would you deal with lonliness in my  situation?	First of all read all of this before answering. Second of all, I'm 24 I live out in the country, I don't know how to drive because I can't. So my friends or mom take me to church or bible study. That's the only social activity I get. All the men in my church are married. ALL of them! I do not work because I'd have to drive somewhere to work. So again I don't drive and don't know how and my parents won't let me(which is fine).      I don't know any single guys and I don't have any single friends.      Sometimes though I get lonely for some male affection and cuddling. That's impossible because I live in the middle of nowhere and don't drive and the people at my church are married.      In a year and a half if I do get accepted at a college I will move to Chicago. But until then how do I deal with this lonliness and desire to cuddle with a single guy?         If this means anything I don't need a guy to make me happy, I am happy and I don't need a guy to complete me.  I don't need him to take care of me.  And I don't need someone to take care of.

I broke up with him around November and i broke up with him because to many people were nosy and in our relationship and because i felt that he was messing with other people but i never confronted him about it. To be more specific, one of my friends liked him and she was bugging him to go out with her, so he acted like he liked her but in my eyes i could see that he probably actually did like her....to this day i still don't know. my friend and him went out for 2 days after i broke up with him. then my other friend started to like him on and off. she went out with him ...believe it or not .....5 times!!!! they kept on breaking up because the girl was playing him with another guy each time!!!! now they go out and their relationship lasts longer . my friend alwasy tells me what they do together but most of the time she makes the moves...he just sits back and take it and tat lets me know that he is not really interested...because when he and i were going out, he always used to make the moves on me. now i like him more that i am not with him and i am guessing that he likes me also becasue when she wants to make a move on him when i am around, he acts like he does not want to do it. i know him more than all the other girls do and our relationship was just more than sex. i puppy love him!!!lol and i want to be with him!! but he goes with her!!!! and she is still my friend ....when we talk on the phone he says that he misses me and he said that he likes gabby to(the one he goes out with). i was thinking that if they break up, we could go out next year. gabby (my friend his gf) says that if she knew that i liked him she would back off and she says that if she breaks up with him she would hook me up with him!!!! what should i do????? and what do you get out of all of this?????

20090226134551AA6mWxc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, guys help me please.?	Okay i asked the other day about waht should i do about my ex and this and people told me to move on.  I have 3 problems now.   Well for one there is this one guy that likes me and wants to take me to prom. The thing is i only want him as a friend and nothing more. I dont mind going to prom with him (if he ever ask me) but he wants way more than friends and i just cant see my self dating him. What should i tell him?      Then there is this other guy who likes me and has for a long time but he's played my best friend before so i dont know what to do there. We've been talking like crazy since me and my ex broke up and yesterday he said he really wants to be more than friends but he understand that i want to wait because i just got out of an 8 month relationship. I like him yes but i keep thinking that if i really want a relationship that i should date him but if i want to have a good time and thats all then yeah i should go for it. So what do i do about that? Should i go for it or not?      Okay last problem, I promise. So there is a guy that i used to work with and he's really sweet and were "best buddies" as we say. Well when we worked together he would kinda flirt but only when this other guy wasnt around. Well all the flirting and everything stopped when i stopped working well lately it seems like he's been starting back with the whole flirt thing. and i have to say he is kinda cute and i do kinda like him. But i dont know what to do. I would love to go to prom with him. So how do i bring it up? What is away that maybe i could get him to ask me before the other guy?      Sorry i had so many problems but will yha'll please help me i really dont have an idea about what i should.

20090226142436AAoIUP5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So what can I do about this? I'm confused. Am I using these girls as fall-backs?	Well, there's this girl whom I dated for about 9 months, then switched schools. I was in love, I know I was. We've been talking ever since, but we decided to just try and get over each other but we couldn't. One day we ran into each other at the mall, and we started getting to real talking again. It was amazing. We planned to meet again at a friends house, and we all stayed the night. She cried to me that night telling me how much she loved me. It was the best feeling ever. I waited on her for a year, and I finally had her back :] Then this other guy came over, and she was all over him, like me and her never happened. She went into a bedroom and locked the door, and they almost had sex. I just cried and cried in a bathroom pitch black. Then we talked through everything, and we decided to just let each other go. It broke me. So I've started trying to get rid of her in my mind. Then the first couple days were terrible. Then an old friend text me and told me to come to her game, so I did, and we got to liking each other. Then the next day I switched schools, and I like like 3 people there, 4 in all! I've never ever done this. My friend says I'm probably just trying to cope and don't realize it, do you think that's possible?

20090226125239AAXfrmX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How much time is "fair" for time away from your girlfriend (guy nights, etc)?	My girlfriend comes over every weekend, and we have lunch mon/tue/fri.  We also talk to each other on Messenger throughout the day during downtime at work.  I am getting kind of tired, but last time I said this she got her feelings hurt.  Am I wrong for wanting "me" time?  How much time is considered too much.  One weekend every 2 weeks to myself?  I care for her a lot, and don't want her thinking I don't love her.  I sometimes just want time to be a man, and do man stuff without being critiqued.

Then he said said things to me like "I can feel you so good, i can feel you all around me, every inch" And "I wish I could make you c u m" "I want to get you on a bed where I can do you how I want to, would you c u m for me then?"      I know it seems more like "banging" then "love making" but the fact that he said things to me that let me know he was with "me" makes it feel to me more like an experience  we shared rather than him just 'getting his"??

20090226135516AAh9cWk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me? (20 characters)?	okay so i asked before if he like me and everybody said yes and ask him if he does like me. turns out he didnt because he asked this other girl out. but when she rejected him, he told me about it and i tried to help him. but then i started kind of ranting ? and he said "whoah TMI" and it got me mad because i tried to help him and thats all i got. not even a thankyou. but then that night i saw him in a non school related class (we dont go to the same school) and for some reason (i dont know why) halph way through the class i started crying (i dont know why. just alot of things have been happening latley... stress?) anyways, he came over to me (the whole class was starring at me) and he put his arm around me and said "are you okay?" then he kept his arm around me and the teacher asked me whats wrong but then i walked out and went in to the bathroom. i didnt want people to "OOH" and "AAH" about me. then the next day on email chat (gmail :) i asked him if he was still down about how the girl turned him down. he said, "no i think im on drugs. i dont know why im so happy..." and then we continued to talk about the subject and when he had to leave he said "thanks for talking to me. i needed it." then i said bye and so did he. aslo during that conversation he was comphorting me and helping me on my crying scene in the class and making me feel better about it.       he says he is over the rejection from her and he says that he doesnt even remember that a cried, trying i guesst o make me feel better. i get the feeling that there are feelings that werent there before between us. hes never put his arm around me before when i was down, or with any other girl, and even though we fought that night, he still came over and helped me out. and every time he sees me come in, hes like " hey look Eve's here!" and i get the feeling that he doesnt like the other girl anymore and maybey he likes me..... i dont know.........      suggestions? observations? doe he like me?

Soon after that I told two other friends who I love just as much, and then this girl Jazmine said, OMG U LIKE ***** and I smiled, and she knew. I went on vacation and I have NO clue what happened those days. It's been about a week since I got back, and a girl in my grade said, you like *****? and I asked where she heard that from, and she said she'd heard it last week. About five minutes later, she took me into the locker room and told me she was kidding, and that she didn't hear anything. I avoided the guy all day today, just to play it safe, but I'm still scared...       P.S. The guy I like might like me back, but it's such a small chance I'm positive he doesn't.

It took my wife one month to stop thinking about and craving our 3rd wheel. He was a tall and well endowed black man. My wife was so turned on by him and was so sexual with him that she only craved him after. It took her a month before she snapped out of it and finally slept with me.       Has this happened to any of you the first time you had a 3-way?
20090226141916AAbPmGB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this boy like me?	We're just friends and he is not like any other boy. He does not crave for *** but he does flirt a lot with girls. He always ims me and we talk a lot. We always have conversations and he tells me about his problems. I tell him about my problems as well. So when I feel sad he comforts me and he said he would be there in a heartbeat. He also says that if a gender is friends with the opposite gender they will always have feelings towards them at one point(That is just HIS opinion).He also said nothing was wrong with me and that I was perfect. I knew he liked me. But later on, he tells me about the girls he likes and says I'm not his type. I'm confused, does he like me or not?    btw we are both young teens.

This man exbits all of these traces too, his faces poured boiling hot water over his legs when he was 20 yrs old (this was to the man Im talking about) because there is no pattern to his drinking and its when ever he wants I dont know if hes an alcoholic or not he still keeps his job going and all but maintains no realtionships because he doesnt want too

20090226131903AABSQN3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So there's this guy......?	ok there is this guy i have a MAJOR crush on...   i told like 5 of my friends (the ones i trust)    and one of them told him i liked him.   and he had no idea who i was.   and then at school the next day   my firend who told him pointed me out for him/.   i thought she was going to like point at me at my locker,   but no   she pulled on my hood and called the guy and went" This is elizabeth!!!"   and then she finally let go and i ran to my locker, opened it up and hid my face in it.   and like everyone in my class was like "elizabeth! elizabeth! turn around!"   so i turn around.   and there is the dude i liked.   he said hi. and i said hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii   then i walked into homeroom.   then at lunch my bestie (whos friends with the guy i like)   told me this girl in my class said to the guy i liked:   "Ill give you 5 bucks if you go out with elizabeth."   and he said no.   but the bestie *friends with dude i like, i now call her bestie.*   the bestie said it was because he probably didnt want to bet on it.   andd thennn   i thought that the guy i liked thought that i told the girl to bribe him.   so my other friend tells him i had no idea...   and she makes me go and talk to him.   and she told him to say hi... and it makes me mad cuz he already said hi to me.   so i say hi and he says hi.   then she goes now lets get-   and then i rin away, she grabs me and says   "i was gettign to the point"   but i still ran      nowww i think i blew it and im embarrassed.   he also said he barely knows me..   and i want to try to get to know him but   he knows how i feel about him and i dont know how he feels about me.   and my bestie hangs out with him like everyday and whenever i ask her to hang with me so i dont look like an idoit around him she never does.   and i really want us to go out.... but theres not really a way for me to get to know him or him to get to know me without me looking like an complete idoit. is there any way i can get him to know me or better yet ask me out without me looking like an idiot..... help?
20090226131312AAzaLij	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He like EYE FU*** me....?	So I like this kid n he knows I like him n he always looks at me n holds open doors for me n stood up for me once. Were both sophmores. We've never talked before. So me n my friend passed him n I didn't c him so my friend goes look who it is so I look over n he's staring at me from the side of his eye,he didn't turn his head he just gave me the most cute innocent look ever,it was great. I guess he didn't wanna make it obvious but we both saw him n he looked at me dead in the eye. So my friend turns back to me n goes "wow he just eye ****** you" n after that he did it again. So why???
20090226121611AAkGUGC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	OMG Do you think he likes me?	Ok, so I've asked some questions about if Myles may like me. I like him, and he knows that I do. (A few of my friends also know that I like him.)   We have one class together, band. He plays trumpet and I play clarinet.   And the other day, Myles saw a bit of another side of me... Normally I'm insanely quiet and stuff, unless I'm with my friends. So. I was talking to my best friend across the music room. She said 'oh so Amanda, I got a 100 on my math quiz!' and I was like 'oh wow, that's amazing' because that isn't really normal for her at all... But anyway, so then I said 'so I still haven't finished reading the stuff' (for English which was the next class we had) and she said 'oh my God, still?' and I said that I only have a page left to read and I'd finish it soon. Then she came over to me, and explained the last page to me though I'd read sparknotes and finished it two minutes later, but throughout that part where my friend and I were talking across the room, Myles was there and I think he was listening a bit, and he seemed to have a bit of a smile/smirk on his face. That's like the first time that I've been like that near him.   We've talked on facebook a few times. The first time, he actually initiated the conversation by saying hello. I said hey, he got off a little later, and came back on about an hour later. I asked him why he said hello and he said 'idk, maybe i felt like it at the time. should i not say hello to you anymore' and I said no, and I was just wondering why.   When I told one of my friends (my best guy friend) that I liked Myles and about this conversation, he said that by saying hello, Myles was putting himself out there.   In our most recent conversation, I said hey, and he said 'you like germany' which means that he must have been looking at my profile. So then we were talking about Germany and German for a bit. He said 'konnen sie es sprechen' so he was trying to ask if I can speak German. I answered in German, and then said that if I were to correct him, what it would be. Then he said, 'wow, im impressed' Then a few minutes later I had to go eat dinner. When I got back, he was still on and I had a notification that he had tagged me in a note (25 Random Things). Then when I was back, he signed off.   So on Monday, I was walking in the halls before the first bell. There weren't many people in the halls, I was heading one way, passed a teacher I had last year, and Myles was just behind her. As we passed each other, he looked up, I smiled, and he returned the smile. (And then I was really quite happy for a while.)   Ok, so I think he may like me, but I don't know what to do now. Like how do I flirt with him, and how can I find out for sure if he likes me besides just flat out asking him if he does.   And we don't really talk in person. I know we should, but I can never talk to him alone. One of us is always with friends...   Thank you for any help.

20090226124953AATvuNG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My friend KNOWS her dad is cheating on her mom, I try to help her, but what do I say?	My friends dad is cheating on her mom. I feel TERRIBLE for her, and I don't know what she should do!      I try to give her the advice, but it's hard, I have never been in that situation. I am 14, grade eight, so were not in that "I'm too cool to talk to my mom about anything" Stage yet. Oh, and one more thing. This girl has alot of proof (Reads texts, listens to conversations, and heard one comment like)      "Yeah, pack clothes....Nooo! Don't take it off,..Well, I guess you COULD come naked if you want, but not until we get to the hotel room....Okay, love you, bye"      And he is going away on a buissiness trip TOMOROW!!      So, the options are      A) Tell her mom, pros are that she wont have to live a lie, and once her mom knows she can SCREEEEAM at her dad. Cons are that...Her family will be torn apart, and she will have to move away before graduation seeing as her dad will no longer live with her and they ALL shared the house...:(         B) Keep it a secret from everyone; pros are the her family will still love eachother and everything, cons are that she will know all the love is fake, and she will have to live with the man-whore she is forced to call a father.      C) Tell her dad that she knows everything, and force HIM to fess up so she will not have to be put in an awkward situation with her mother. Pros are that, well, no awkwardness, cons are that if she's alone with her father, it might get a bit scary..... (Not abuse, lol, he is a policeman)         HELLLP!!!
20090226135618AATxdWU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would u do if...?	what would you do if the guy u like (who also likes u) (who also likes another girl) told u that he has been "taking turns" between u and the other girl that he likes?      the guy that i like  told me today that he was "taking turns" focusing on me and that other girl. so i told him that he should just stop liking me cuz i dont wanna share and so then like hes like ''ok i dont like u anymore then''      but the night before he  told me that (his exact words) "im the most beautiful, talented, sexy, smart girl he noes and i have this 'thing' that other girls dont have"       idk what to do! hes being soo bipolar about him liking me. i want him to just make up his mind. and im upset i feel like i was just used or something...and just like that he stopped liking me...and he didnt mean what he said to me about me being beautiful and stuff.      what would u do?

20090226130228AA5N0WK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friends and Family Volunteering you to do things?	My aunt is constantly doing this. I don't know how to deal with it other than ignore it. Examples...      Her son was selling cookie dough and cakes at a very high price for band. He's 14. I'm on a extremely tight budget since I've recently gotten married and my job has went to part time. And she says you will have to let ( MY NAME ) look at the cookie dough and cakes and buy some from you. I didn't say anything. I thought did you just volunteer me to buy some? And If I say I can't I'm going to look mean.      Another thing she said during the same day. Her daughter is 21 and stays at home not looking for a job and was going to try and get people to hire her to sing for them during valentines day. So they made a bunch of flyers. My aunt says you will have to give some of those flyers to ( MY NAME ) so she can pass them out and hang them up in her town, and give some to her husband too so he can hang them around he's work area. I yet again didn't say anything. I don't have the time to do that let alone want to do that. I wouldn't benfit from it.      Then another person in our family is always volunteering her kids to stay with us. The last time we saw her she said to her 8 year old daughter in front of us when are you going to go stay with them? And then another time during christmas she said are my boys going to stay at yalls house? Right in front of them, and we didn't know what to say because we don't want to be mean and hurt anybodys feelings.      How do you deal with people doing stuff like this? Do you think it's ok? Or inconsiderate?

20090226114102AAOsLED	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I over come MASTURBATION addiction?	Hi.            Alright, this is kind of embarrassing, well, sick, but ... What the heck? I am a teenager, and I started masturbating at the age of nine (because my friends showed me a porn video! Hmmm. And I decided to give it a go). I ENJOYED IT. Ha ha ... I have never gone a day without it! Even when me and my family go on holiday and I share a room with someone, I masturbate quietly under the covers. It's become so extreme, I even masturbate in my classes! Although my attendance, behaviour, etc is good. All the kids in my year aren't even freaked out about it anymore, they're so used to seeing me do it. Even the teachers don't care anymore (the one's who have noticed). So basically I am masturbating 24/7. I have decided to stop, it's gross for a young girl to do that in public! No one has talked to me about it before, because they're used to it now. I NEED HELP! Say whatever you want, negative or bad. I just need advice.      Help.

There's a girl in my Spanish class that I like, and I think she must like me at least a little, but we can never seem to get a conversation going. We have some common interests, so it shouldn't be hard, but it is for some reason. Maybe because small talk isn't really something I'm good at. How can I get a conversation going??? What should I do? It always starts with one of us asking a question and saying something, the other one responding, and then it just kind of stops for some reason.

There's one who I've liked for 2 years (call him 'A') and one who I properly met about 5 months ago (call him 'B'), cos he sits opposite me in Chemisty, Biology and Physics.      I've liked 'A' for 2 years, I've known for 4 years, since we started secondary school. We know each other pretty well and he is possibly the nicest guy you'll ever meet. The problem is, he said he liked me too, but doesn't want to go any further than just friendship (he said this in a valentines card). But it's getting harder and harder cos I still like him.      However, 'B' I've only liked him the last few weeks. I'm not sure if he likes me too (I doubt it), but we help make science bareable for eachother, and he's quite a laugh. I've just found out that he's sort of an 'item' with someone else as of the other day :S      The problem here is I'm 5ft 9, and self concious of my height, and 'B' is probably 5ft 6? and 'A' is 6ft, and I feel more comfortable about his height, and I'm worrying if I'll look stupid with the shorter guy, even though there's no chance at all with him.      But that's not the main problem. As much as I like the 1st guy more, I'm not sure if I'm better off liking the other guy and just be friends with 'A'?      Help :(   Thanks x

In The Month That We've Been Going Out We Have Only Met Up Once, And She Says This Is Because She Is Grounded but then she is always allowed out except if its to see me, she see's her Ex more than me, and their relationship is suspicious because she says that at school they always play games which involve him "innocently" touching her.   Also i cant contact her, she says that her computer is broken (even though she went on msn the other day and didn't even speak to me, but she did change her personal message to saying all the people she loves and putting me, her supposed boyfriend, second to last and her ex before me).   her dad has confiscated her phone because she's grounded except at night she steals it back so she can text me when all her other friends are asleep (i asked her who else she texts at that time of night)   she lives in the next city so i accept that i wouldn't see her everyday, but she wont even let me take her out when she says she's free one weekend.   i'm usually really trusting when it comes to my girlfriend, but my Best friend told me that she was using me and i'm really starting to believe her but i don't know and certainly don't want to, i still think that my girlfriend is amazing beyond all end but i'm utterly confused so please help!! do you think she is using me from what i have told and if so what should i do??

I also said I didn't want a chinese last name when we get married... which is also true.       Ok, so you can see why he is mad like almost break-up mad with me.  I called him again last night to see why he was mad and we had a scary talk, he said he has "doubts" about us. I also sent him a bunch of texts last night and wrote a letter which I will mail to him.      What should I do now? Give him some space? Let him text/call me? Please help!
20090226131819AA9umku	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What happened?Where did i go wrong?	Mark is this guy i like. In October, our mutual friend told me mark liked me, after he told mark that i liked him by accident earlier that week.      Ever since before october, he's flirted with me and acted like he likes me. Especially recently, he's been doing this even more and even more intensly (kind of hard to explain).      Well ever since the beginning of the school year, i had a hunch that mark had a crush on Valerie. But as the year went on, i figured they were just friends, because he didn't really act too different around her then he does with other people.       Well now, in class at our table, him and the same mutual friend that told me mark liked me were talking quietly at times, regular voices at other times about who mark was going to ask out to the dance.i was listening to their conversation and over heard them talking that he was going to ask VALERIE!! The mutual friend said that Jonny was going to ask Velerie out soon, so Mark had to move fast.They didnt know whether or not she would say yes, because they said she was hard to read.      But he said he texts her everyday and talks to her on aim all the time. he never even asked me for phone number or screen name once.      I'm so confused now. the way he talked about her, the look on his face. he really likes her. he was messing around with his hair, worrying how he looked before he was going to ask her out. He chickened out for the past two days, but he says he's going to do it soon.      But he still acts the same way around me. i dont understand any of this.      can someone please tell me what you think of this situation, because I'm really confused and hurt right now.      by the way, i'm in 8th grade if that helps.
20090226121030AAxRuYF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is going  on with my boyfriend? Is he cheating?	i have been dating my boyfriend "d" for a little over 5 months now.  We were in a long dis relationship up until two weeks ago.  He lived about four hours away from me.  In the past we would see each other twice a month, and everything was going amazing!  He was very affectionate and just seemed really into me.  We had sex almost every weekend we saw each other and it was amazing.  Now he recently (3 weeks ago) moved in with my roommate and I and things have just been really weird.  He started shying away from my touch and acting kind of distant.  I asked him what was going on and why he wouldn't let me touch him anymore.  His answer was he was just stressed from moving and things should get better once he settles in.     It has still been going on so i brought it up the other night.  I told him it was really starting to bother me that he didn't want me to touch him.  I am a very affectionate person, that's why it bothers me.  He said that he hates being touched by anyone and it has always been an issue for him.   What really hurt me was that he told me the only reason he had sex with me when he did was because he had alcohol in his system and it calmed him down and made him more comfortable with me.  He also told me if i did not respect the fact he does not like to be touched maybe we shouldn't be together.  Another thing he brought up is that he thought i was so independent and now I'm not at all.  Just because i love to spend time with him does not mean i depend on him for anything...   He never seemed to have a problem with me touching him before and i thought he enjoyed it.  He now refuses to have sex with me and i am not allowed to touch him unless he shows he wants to be.  Even kissing and hugging are out of the question.  I hate it and it hurts me because i feel like the plague.   Someone told me it sounded like he was cheating because of the way he is now acting.  Does that make sense to you?  What is going on and how can i get things back to the way they were.  What should i do?

NO i want it as though im talking to her normally and in some way get me to say foot rub. but not in a freaky way seriously so any suggestions?

20090226112335AAI4O95	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Past sexual abuse affecting relationship?	my boyfriend and i have been fighting lately because of me. i have low self esteem issues and assume he thinks i'm ugly and fat and such.   between the ages of 5 and 8 i was molested by both my half brothers and their father. when i was 15 i told my mom and she got mad at me and blamed me. we haven't mentioned it since. i've been through therapy but find that reading about it helps me more. the other thing is witnessing my mom and siblings, and occasionally me, get the crap beaten out of us by my moms husband (and brothers' father). if they would get beaten because they were mean to me they would blame me. and still do. i wouldn't tell on them. plus i was under 10. he left us in 2000. i'm 18 now but still have some issues with men. not to mention my biological father ran off on my mom when he found out she was pregnant and i've only seen him once. and occasionally talk to him via email.      the point is i need to voice this to my boyfriend. i need advice on how to do this. we are expecting a baby in october and i really need this to be out in the open in order to continue our relationship. HELP!

20090226140711AAsyisI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is Your Boyfriend/Girlfriend also your Best Friend?	Was just wondering: is your boyfriend/girlfriend also your best friend?      My boyfriend was telling me that I am his best friend and that he feels honoured. He was saying that to many guys, they have a girlfriend and that's all she is: a girlfriend. I think it's pretty cool how he considers me to be his best friend. I don't understand what he meant by some guys just have a girlfriend and that's all she is? I mean...when you're with a guy/girl don't you need to have that same level of trust, fun, communication etc. that you have with your best friend? Or are some peoples relationships not like that? I think it's an important foundation for a long-lasting relationship with your partner..      Thanks.

20090226113131AADCdHz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she confused or what?	My girlfriend and I broke up after 4 years together, recently she has been talking alot (and I as well) about marriage, kids, the heavy stuff. We also got into a fight about abortions, 2 days later she broke up with me. She has been hanging out with 2 girls in college that are not good influences, one dates a convicted fellon, and the other just tried to kill herself. They hate me because I dont like them. She told me that her friends made her think and she doesnt love me anymore. Keep in mind we are BEST friends, ands she is a very loving person. Neither of us have ever dated other people before. Ive talked to her parents and her cousin (who is very close to the both of us) and they seem to think that her loving me is not the case, I never see her anymore becuse we commute an hour to college, and she decided to get a dorm room when she broke up with me. Any clues on whats going on? I really believe we are meant to be      Now she refuses to talk to me

20090226120052AAp5xyc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	REALLY bad breakup, help please?	Ok, so, it all started 2 years ago when i was happily dating my long term girlfriend in new Mexico...while i was in georgia, weird i know.      Anyway, this girl also talked to another one of my friends who happened to be a girl.      So, girl #2 decided to tell me that girl #1 was saying mean things about me behind my back, nothing mindblowing, just mean things, and that she wanted to break up with me.      So, I broke up with her, and she is a weird girl, so she goes suicidal and starts freaking out, and she wouldn't talk to me for 6 months.      So in that time i get together with girl #2 because i didn't know she was lying to me.      This is fine and dandy for about 2 months until one of my guy friends starts hinting that he is also dating my girlfriend, so...i look into it but i find nothing, but she always goes to his house and comes back at like 11...      so, i find out eventually from some snooping with me and the friend from the above paragraph that she has been dating 3 of my best friends simultaneously...hmm...      anyway, i confront her on this and she denies everything, posing as a good little christian girl.      so, she starts lying about me behind my back, to my best friends saying that i beat her and stuff, and that a was a possessive crybaby who couldn't let go, but i wasn't possessive or a crybaby, i just loved her =(.      So, one of my friends who remains anonymous to this day exposes her lies, very angrily, and she morphs this into my "works of jealousy" eventually making all of her friends, who are also my friends, and the majority of my friends, hate me, for hating her, which i really don't.      She gets one of her henchmen to make death threats on me and i get beaten up outside school one day and he used to be my best friend.      I tried to tell her that this was outragous and i did not hate her, but every time i tried to talk to her she would make a huge scene as if she was being raped and would make me stop talking, so a wrote a note, which she promptly reported to the administrators at our school who had previously told me and her not to have contact with one another.      The administratos had said that if she talked to me, i was to report it to them, and if i talked to her, she would, but, while she did this several times, there was no evidence.      So, when she reported the paper, i got suspended from school for a week.      which brings me to this day...      what do i do???

20090226115623AAtQ7mT	Family & Relationships;Friends	My Best friend is the opposite sex....  Evaluate...?	We are so good together, and everyone thinks we've already had sex.  We laugh constantly when we are together. The situation is this.  We are both attracted to younger people.   I value our friendship more than anything and would die if i lost it, but lately my luck with men has been really awful.  and I've been entertaining thoughts about him that i never have before.  It may be just that i'm lonely, but we have so much fun together and there's never the awkward silence and things seem so right when were together....  what do i do???  Tell him and risk losing the best friend i've ever had, or keep it to myself and spend the rest of my life wondering what if...
20090226115600AAenSPM	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I get revenge on this one girl?	There's this girl at my school, Charlotte, I used to be good friends with her when we were little but then she moved, not so far away. She went to a different school and we moved on.            This year she came back to my school and everybody is friends with her, but some of my friends and I hate her. She flirts with everybody and goes out with them the next second.            She has a boyfriend, Sean, he is actually my best guy friend that goes to that old school she went to. Since he goes to a different school he can't see that she flirts.            Before they kept it a secret since she found out my friends and I said, "She goes out with everyone." My two friends, Kayla and Elizabeth spent the night and we decided to call Sean. We we're going to see if he was really going out with her. We also wanted to tell him about her flirting with other guys in the past. It got all bad and we just ended it and said sorry.            Elizabeth actually tried pretending to be friends with Charlotte to see if she would confess anything. She actually said in one line, "It sucks to like someone when they don't know you exist." We're still not sure who she is talking about. But what's even better, Elizabeth now is best friends with Charlotte and likes her.            Anyway, the real problem. Her next target is my boyfriend. Me and my boyfriend have been going out for 6 months now and I don't think we breaking up anytime soon. The newest problem is that she is telling my boyfriend bad things about. Like the other day, she told him that I said, "I'd trade my boyfriend for (her ex boyfriend) anyday." I said that in October and was kidding and being sarcastic. My boyfriend got really upset. I told him I said that but was totally kidding and didn't even like that kid.            I know this is really long story but I want to get this girl bad. Please please help me out,

20090226121709AA95XTQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Momma's Boy? What would U do?	So after my daughter was born me and her father left each other. Mainly because he was a very unaffectionate person, I always felt lonely. Months later I met this guy, he’s probably what I always asked for in my baby’s father. Sweet, honest and very VERY respectful. He is so respectful to everyone and hates the word or thought of “disrespect” very much, it’s his pet peeve. He’s my age (25) lives with his mother because he’s an only boy. The problem is that I think he’s a momma’s boy, and he admits it, he’s told me that NO ONE will ever be more important than his mother, when he gets married she will live with him and his wife, and that whoever his wife ends up being she will have to understand how once a week he will take his mother on a date. He’s also told me how he will NEVER let anyone, even me, disrespect his mother. I’m worried, what if we end up getting married in the future and she feels “disrespected”? Is it normal that he loves his mother this much? Or am I just being a jealous ******? Oh btw, I am a very Jealous person… argh! I don’t think this is going to work out! I think I’m in love with him now, if it wouldn’t be for that then he would be THE perfect man.

20090226122814AALzuMG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this girl, but very shy?	Yesterday, I saw a girl on the bus through the window. We locked eyes for a little bit. Then she smiled, and I smiled back at her. Don't get me wrong, she is very pretty. This happened after school while I was going to my bus (I'm 14). Today I was going to my bus and her friend asked me would I like to go out with her. I didn't really know if it was that same girl that smiled at me because her head was turnt around at the time. I told him that I couldn't see her, so he tried to get her attention, but she looked mad shy cause she didn't look at me. I didn't have enough time to stay, so I went on my bus. I would go out with her, but I need her to look at me, so I let her know I would. Have any ideas on how to get with her?

20090226124021AA9nTgh	Family & Relationships;Friends	Irritating racist comments by 'friend'?	Hi guys, (and gals) I Go to secondary school in the countryside and by and large I am popular and I rarely get racism directed towards me, and when I do get racism it's in jest and not malicious, save from one person.   He calls me a 'kamikaze slit-eyed japstain' (despite the fact that I've inherited my father's English eyes, I'm 1/2) in class and around school but as soon as he gets on the bus he acts like we're best buddies.   I feel like pummelling his face into a bloody mush sometimes, but the next second I can't do it 'cos he's acting friendly.   One minute spitting out racist comments with pure venom and the next clapping me on the back Is confusing.  He won't shut up about world war two and goes on about 'the japs' I tell him that my English grandfather served in the RAF and that my Japanese grandfather was a fruit-seller but he just pulls his eyes back into slants.  Why does he act friendly at times?     It's really confusing for me.

20090226124106AA2jSOM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Stupid girlfriend. To keep or not to keep?	My 33 year old girlfriend is so stupid that she once asked me if the sun revolves around the Earth! This makes it scary to bring her to social events at my work. I always wonder what kind of stupid **** she is saying to my colleagues! I am not planning to be the President one day but I am decidedly intelligent. What should I do? Should I dump this girl who is hundreds of years behind on common sense? She is definitely not smarter than a fifth grader, which makes it hard because I have several university degrees. The worst thing is that when she asked me, I had to keep a straight face as though this is a normal intelligent question. I would never belittle her by laughing in her face. What should I do?

20090226125004AAXvOlE	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you annoy a female roommate subtly?	So my roommate keeps the light on the whole night. She keeps two alarms to wake her up, but usually I have to yell at her to wake up and turn off the alarms. All she does is put them on snooze, so I have to wake up every 15 mins throughout the night. I've told her that it bothers me and I'm losing A LOT of sleep over it, but all she says is "It's a habit, I can't change." She is messy and can sleep through anything so anything related to that doesn't help. She is passive aggressive, so I need to find a way to get back in the same manner. Help!!!

He's told me every single day that he loves me and I tell him I love him and he says one day that he wants to marry me. The past few days he's been a bit off. He's not getting along with his sister and hasn't been in the best mood and he's just not himself. I have no idea what he's thinking, I just can't tell with him :S and he just hasn't seemed too interested in me these past few days. I'm so scared that he'll dump me. :( I'm really worried because I absolutely love him to pieces and I don't know what I'd do without him. I know that might sound mad but he's the most amazing person I've ever met... and I'm terrified. Also, I do get a bit paranoid, I think about things a bit too much... the last guy I was with hurt me so that's probably why I'm so worried. Should I just ask? Any tips for me? Thanks so much x

20090226132527AAsbngu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I stay with my since I found out she slept with a woman?	My wife and I have been married for 2 years. We have recently gotten back together from a 5 month separation, which greatly hurt me. When I came back home, I found out that she had had sex with a woman during the separation. She didn't tell that she did, I found out by stumbling across a card which had been given to her by this lesbian female. Evidently, her and my wife had been seeing each for about 4 months of the separation. I confronted her about the situation and she claims that she isn't a lesbian. Then, I find more hidden cards and notes from this same female. Why is she keeping them? Will I ever be able to get over what I have found out about my wife? Should I even try to make it work with her? We do have children together and I want to be in their lives. I also love my wife very much, but it's is hard not to think about what I have found out.

20090226143847AAujsJk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm having a lot of boyfriend trouble and I need advice! I can't take this anymore!?	I'm 15 and he's 16. We've been dating for almost 7 months. He told me he loved me, but he doesn't really say that anymore. And we hold hands once a week, IF I'm lucky. He's been ignoring me on and off and has walked right past me countless times. He has ADHD, but how much would that have to do with him acting like this? When he does this, he's usually with one of his friends. Today this happened at least 3 times, and I know he saw me. He could have at least said hi to me, but he didn't say a word to me today. No hug, no nothing. My friend told him I'm mad at him (and I'm glad she did since I didn't have a chance to talk to him), and he said one of his friends is thinking about running away. I understand that, but if he at least said hi, I wouldn't be so upset. We don't have school tomorrow, and he's at his dad's this weekend, so I won't be able to see him or anything. I don't have his dad's number, and he said his cell phone "doesnt work" or he "doesnt have minutes on it" or the "charger doesn't work anymore". I was planning on telling him how I feel when he acts like I don't exist, but he walked right past me again at the end of the day. Now I have this to worry about all weekend, but I'm not suprised anymore. I don't want to break up with him, but what should I say to him if he even talks to me on Monday?? Please help! I'm really upset!

20090226143059AAJU7YK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How long should sex last?	I am beginning to get a little worried that I am taking too long over sex - particularly when I talk to some of my friends and they tell me how quick it's over with for them.      From start to finish, my average time is about 40 mins (this is the average time of the intercourse bit). My overall love sessions, including massage, tickling and teasing, usually takes about 3 or 4 hours.      Is this too long, too short or about average?
20090226154151AA2nAsZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I dont know what to do or think anymore?	I liked this guy for almost a year now, i dont see him at all at school anymore cause our classes arent by each other. I only see him on the bus but i dont talk to him anymore.. Cause a few weeks ago he told me he liked some other girl in a different school, i got hurt. But then one of his friends said the guy doesnt like anyone and he told his gal friend "someone you'll least expect" when i was right there, the day after he told me about the other chick.         So basically ive been trying to get over him and how i do that is not communicate.I've never told him i liked him cause it'd get awkward and weird or something wack. My plan is to see if he realizes that if we arent talking anymore, he'll do something. Dont get me wrong im not trying to avoid him completely xD      So should i just move on? should i tell him i used to like him? should i not talk to him or still talk to him? im confused..      thanks for your help..

20090226142838AA6pmQ6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this girl?	Okay so there is this girl and her name is Whitney.  Well she always sits next to me and stares at me.  She laughs at everything I say.  She knows I have a girlfriend and she was there when I got in a fight over my girl, long story, and she acts like she wants me to dump my girlfriend.  But I have dated her for 4 years and I would die for her.  Whitney will sit by me at lunch if my girl isn't there and she touches me when ever she can.  She asked me out once and I said no.  But now she is staring, sitting by me, and touching me more than ever.  But here is the odd thing I am strangely attracted to her.  What should I do???
20090226142558AAU07KA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he's just using me?	I have been 'seeing' this guy for about a month. We're 19, and I'm in second year of uni - he's in his first because he took a year off to volunteer. He doesn't have a job because, as I just mentioned, it's his first year in school, plus he's the president of this club he started here so he's pretty busy with that. My point of all this is - he doesn't have a job right now (he's starting to apply for some though), meaning he doesn't have a lot of money. Therefore, most of the time when we 'hang out', we hang out in my room and 'do' stuff.      To be fair, we have gone 'out' to a couple things... he invited me to come out to the bar for his friend's b-day (I couldn't though), we went to some gathering at another pub one night with some mutual friends, he took me out for pizza at his fave place (very casual), been to Starbucks a few times, etc. But never out to a sit down dinner or to a movie or anything like that.      Now, I have been okay with this... I'm going on exchange next year and we both know this isn't going to be a long term/serious thing. But today my friend asked if I thought it was weird that we normally only hang out in my room and fool around. So it got me to thinking... do you think it sounds like he's using me? Or do you think it's just because our 'relationship' is super casual, plus his whole not having money deal?      Thanks in advance.

20090225115436AAGyeKF	Family & Relationships;Friends	Find an apartment with a friend of the opposite sex?	My best friend and I graduated college last June, and we've each been living at our parents house in order to save up some money. We have steady jobs in town, and he suggested we go out for an apartment together, now that we've got money saved up.      The only thing is, we're a single girl and guy, and there are certain connotations to living together. We are definitely not friends like THAT at all. Some people believe us when we say it, but many people think we're together because we get along so well. The thing is, we have so much in common that I'd rather spend time with him than with most other people, but the thought of kissing him is disgusting. He's expressed the same opinion about me, so we have a completely mutual brother/sister type relationship.      I'm kind of nervous about what other people will presume about us if we get an apartment together. I'm on the search for a boyfriend and he's on the search for a girlfriend, and I'm wondering how living together might affect that part of our lives.      What would you think of two friends, opposite sex, living together? Would you believe them if they said they were just friends?      Would you date someone who lived with someone of the opposite sex?      If you were me, would you just stay at Mom & Dad's until you had enough money for a down payment for a permanent place, rather than wasting money on an apartment in between?

20090225115302AAjhN8j	Family & Relationships;Friends	Anyone been in this situation?	Basically in 2008, i saw a vast amount of girls and nothing seemed to come from any of them.      Its quite depressing to think how many times i have been unsuccessful but at least i have had my mates to pick me up.      Now my two best mates out of my group have met girls out of nowhere at the same time and now both in serious relationships and far too busy all the time. (literally with there girlfriend every single day)      So i have fallen out with one now because he completely forgot my birthday (he was busy seeing his girlfriend instead)       I felt like he was just using me when his girlfriend was busy........i also hardly get chance to talk to the other mate now either.      Although im quite a independent person, its just depressing to think that if i get dumped or fail a exam etc... i got no one to turn to anymore
20090226153251AA2Qrbw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do strangers (mainly in city) ask to use phone to make one call and....?	when they do, the call usually goes to voice mail.  Ill have people come up to me wanting to use my phone.  I wanna help but i dont like it if they try to use up my phone for a long time or if they call, the phone rings and then they quit the call.  Rarely ever do they talk to someone on the other line, they just dial a number, put phone to ear, listen and then they give your phone right back.      What is the purpose of them doing this.  A stranger came up to me today and was like "i lost my phone, i want to call my phone to see if i can turn it off".  She dials a number, lets phone ring, no one picks up, then she gives me my phone back.       Why does a peron do this, can a person get info off of using someone elses phone number?

20090226154600AAv9UVC	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I tell her to shut her mouth before I punch her?	Almost everyone at school (besides her jerk of a bf Keston) hates my ex BFF Trina. She was always talking sh*t and acting like she never said anything like she's so perfect. Well about 6 of my friends spoke to her yesterday and she was saying I am a "crack head c**t", a "fat wh*re" and "I had drinking problems and drank my self crazy when my fat loser ex dumped me". When they spoke to her again she denied ever talkin. Haley, Natalie, Hayley, and Aliyah are not talking to her anymore especially after that. Justina and Elizabeth still talk to her even though she always talks about them. And about everyone! And no I'm not exagerating. Should I tell her off tommorrow? I'm sure everyone always wanted to but are too scared of her making stuff up and getting them in trouble. And no, my friends would never lie about this.

I love them both so much but in very different ways.I dont want to loose my GF but I cant imagine not having my BF in my life.Its so wierd but I know one has to go.I just dont feel the same for my BF so I know she will have to let me go or I might have to let her go so she can get over me.I've been in a similar situation with another girl that I loved but I couldnt have her.I had to let her go cause I could take just being her friend.      In the end,my GF was right all along and now I feel stupid that I told her "She was insecure and selfish"She was right      What should I do?  :-(

My friend said that I was "obsessed with Colton" (the guy I used to like but now I like someone else) so I got mad at her because I thought it was mean. So then, after I left, she was talking crap about my friend! Her and someone else. Anyway, I told some guy who likes her that he's too good for her (because I was really mad about her saying that to me and talking about my friend. I know that was a mean thing to say, and I feel bad, but, you know). Anyway, she texted me asking why I was mad, and I said the Colton thing, and it was all good. Then I said I was kinda mad because she told Jessie (her friend) that I liked Jonah. Then a couple of minutes later she wrote back and said, "Ok well idk who u lik now nd ya wat ever hopfully i will get better so that way im good enough for coltor!" (Coltor is the guy that likes her). Ok, so now what should I do? Should I say sorry because I don't want drama, or nothing, or, WHAT? I need help!

20090225114033AA7q0lh	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does my friend of 8 years like me as something more?	I was over at her house the other evening helping her with Pharmacology and she was wearing pajama pants and a tank top type shirt, looking beautiful, and playing love songs on the computer. We have known each other for 8 or 9 years, but she always has viewed me as part of her family like a brother, and I feel the same way like she is my sister, and she has said she wants an older man. We are in our 20's, but I haven't had much experience with relationships, and it's hard to understand women sometimes. I don't know if she just wanted to be comfortable while studying, or was trying to turn me on or something. She did have a guys myspace page up for some of the time. She still lives with her parents while finishing up school, so I didn't want to do anything stupid. But that evening just changed my mood and changed the way I feel about her.

Some women are claiming they weight 110 pounds that are 5'4 or 120 pounds or even under 100.  Yet they wear a size 10 or 8.  I am a size 7/8 and weight 156 pounds.  I also have DDD breast but they only add about 8 pounds I think.   I also work out and look pretty good.  Yet these women i see are bigger than me yet claim to weight 110-130.
20090225114856AALzedY	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you deal with a friend's rude mother?   What would you do?	We recently went on a trip with a friend of ours who is like Forrest Gump. (not being sarcastic)  He is a great guy and we love to spend time with him.  We are his only friends.  He lives at home with his mother. We decided to plan a trip that included a small group of people including him and his mother.  To make a long story short, his mother was rude to us, mean to him and the others on the trip.  She made a scene in public a couple of times that involved her son, our friend and a friend of hers.  She also threatened to leave a person behind on our trip that was walking too slowly.  We were so shocked at that time we did not know what to do.  We are concerned about our friend and we do want to see him again.  We are not afraid to talk to his mother about this however are more concerned that if we try to discuss with her she may not let us see him again.

20090226153725AAvKWIi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get over ex-boyfriend :(?	He and I met online, and were friends/flirted with eachother for years...then we met in real life and we ended up dating for about 6 months, but since he lacks respect and the knowledge of what boundaries are, I broke up with him and it hurts me probably more then it did him.    Because, before we broke up, I told him that if he can start being respectful to me then we can still go on but he said he can not stop being "friendly"      His definition of being friendly is: holding another girl for the entire night, hand all the way around her touching her thigh and her all over him, letting girls spend the night with him.      And, I had to breakup with him because it would only get worse and I hated being hurt all the time knowing im not the only girl he wishes to do that with...I want a guy that treats me special ya know...      Anyways, it hurts me alot knowing that he did not love me enough to just quit being all over another girl and it damaged my self-esteem greatly. He does not seem to be effected by me breaking up him much...first he was all suicidal and stuff, but i told him to quit with the act because if him wanting to die was true he would of easily started respecting me.      Please help me, i see him at school alot [he is a senior so i will not have to next year] and there is no other routes to go....      I need tips other then "just get over it" because he is my first love, and im his first girlfriend so i guess he wanted to experiment, idk!?
20090225114807AASoUtZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	My boyfriend kissed my best friend :(?	I hope you can listen to me and help.      I'm 14, and my boyfriend is 15.   We have been together for quite a while now and he tells me 'i love you' and 'you're the only one' etc ect.   He goes to a different school to my best friend and me.      So finally, me, my boyfriend and my best friend met up for the first time. A couple of hours of meeting her, we were all hugging in a three, all really close. Then my best friend and my boyfriend both gave each other that look. Then they kissed for around a minute, right in front of my face. I mean, they were still hugging me.      I ran away after they'd stopped.      They found me shortly after and i forgave them quickly. My boyfriend told me how sorry he was, and how he was only messing, it meant nothing.      I know he'd never do it again, and i still want to be with him, but i can't get the picture of them out of my head. Right in front of my face. It hurts me so much, and i feel so angry with both of them. I even burst into tears sometimes when i'm with either of them.       What can i do :(   I'm so upset, this happened about 3 months ago, and i just want to go back before it happened. The image plays in my mind like a film, all the time.

20090226143029AA0E7pV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Serious relationship question, please please read!?	Please read through i whole thing, questions are at the end.      Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 11 months it will be a year on April 8. Im turning 15 and he turned 17 this year. I've meet some of his family and he's meet mine. We go to the same school and see each other out of school atleast 3 times a week. I love him and he honestly loves me. This man is the sweetest guy you'd ever meet. I meet him through my friend and she thinks the same (but in a friend way, she thinks it). We've talked about our future together and it seems so perfect. We have been through quiet a bit together, trust me. My questions are these: Do you feel this could be something that could last a long time, even forever. And do you think engagement is ok (i know its odd for our young age but i feel like were soulmates and a promise ring just doesnt seem good enough for us).      p.s. If you have any questions I'll answer back fast.      Thank you all in advance!

20090226154414AApJkOL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why don't men find taller women attractive?	I've never understood why men prefer skinny short girls to taller girls of a healthier weight.  I've called into datelines and done many experiments, I get more interest if I'm 5ft 5 and only weight 110 pounds then if I'm 5ft 8 and weigh 170(which is the healthy weight for that height). So what gives boys? Why do you like the skinny short girls over taller and healthier girls?

20090226152816AA63Fk8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice for Teenage Girls of All Ages?	Girls, I know all of the stuff you go through and there is probably some stuff that I don't know, but I think I have experienced a lot for being eighteen.  I've had good relationships and bad relationships, I've annoyed guys and been probably too clingy, I've felt like the happiest girl in the world, I've felt like there was no point to living over a boy, I've almost gotten pregnant, I actually don't regret my first time, I cried when he didn't call, and smiled so hard when he finally got it right and called when he said, I've been with guys I shouldn't have been with, I've had things with guys that ended up being so pointless to me now, I have way too big of a heart and probably care too much, but you know what?      Everything that I go through will lead me to the right man.   Maybe I am not ready right now, so God will put me with a   couple jerks just so I can learn more and pass the time, because   he knows how I kind of have to have someone in my life!  And hate being lonely And every guy that I have ever been with and everything that I've gone through will eventually lead me to happiness!  =)      You just have to learn to be strong and everything, EVERYTHING, regardless of if you do anything about it or not, will change over time and get better for you in the end      I used to get upset when things did not work out with a certain guy and I admit I still do, but if everything had worked out with the guy, I wouldn't of met the guy I am with now.. I've liked only about 4 guys in my whole life like seriously liked.. and if the first one would have worked out I wouldn't have even met the guys I was with after that.  It's like a chain reaction :)      Love, Kelly
20090226153151AAjCsnz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I hate how guys think I am clingy sometimes.?	But I am working on it.  I know that I'm probably one of the most normal, real, caring girls out there and that I'm not some crazy stalker girl, but I guess guys can think what they want.  People can say and think whatever they want about me, but why should that affect me and how I live my life?      I am learning now to let guys completely come to me.. well mostly.  I'll text him when he stops talking to me and be like we good..?  and then say hey it would be nice to see you before you leave for break, give me a call if you want to meet up.. normal!      and then finally he comes around and says lets hang out on wednesday but then wednesday comes and no phone call..      the old me would cry and text him and say im done youre an a** but the new me is just letting it be, letting him be.  being strong doesn't always have to mean sticking up for yourself, i think being strong can also mean being the bigger person and not even getting involved anymore in the dissapointment and the drama that guys cause.

This girl I never talked to before asked me if I would be her dancing partner in gym.  I said yes but we still didn't talk until this week.  (some small conversations with other people.)  She seems quiet and laughs whenever I do something funny.  I was going to ask her to junior prom because I need a date and she still does too.  I really have to do it now or never because it's getting too late.

20090225114020AAcrXDu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this weird or wrong?....kind of long?	I'm not usually one to ask relationship advise or even discuss my relationships but I've pretty much confused myself to the point I feel like this might actually be a decent idea.       Last September I broke off the relationship with my ex after 13 months. Our relationship was great, he made me happier than anyone has ever come close to but then we hit a rough patch and one day I got really mad and was being a little emotional over something he'd done (I admit I over reacted due to PMS) and so I dumped him. A few months later I started dating this guy I've known for 6 years. He's a great friend, he treats me right, and we have a lot of fun together. I do care about him and he seems to care about me a lot, honestly he seems to care for me a bit more than I do for him. But I still can't stop thinking about and missing my ex. My ex and I talk every now and again, mostly through email. But I think about him just about every moment of every day. It's been almost 6 months, I'd thought I'd be over it by now. I was just wondering if that's normal? Every other relationship I've had I was cool when it ended I'm still friends with all my ex's but this one.. I just can't seem to get over it. My current boyfriend knows how I feel (for the most part) and is pretty much cool with it which earns him massive brownie points but I was wondering, does anyone know how to get him out of my head? To stop pining over the "lost love" as it were? And before anyone accuses me of being a school girl with a crush, I'm an adult, I've been out of school for 4 years now.
20090226154743AAhTbYF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I make a good decision?

We just got back together recently because she said she won't hurt me again and went for counselling for her drinking problem.      During the time we were broken up, I got involved with a sweet, classy girl. A very traditional kind of girl. The type that believes in saving herself for true love. Where as the girl I'm dating lost her virginity at 13. She really loved me. I was her first love. I had feelings for her, but when my girlfriend came back into the picture, I got caught up with her.      Do you think I made a good choice by staying with my g/f since I love her, or would you have given the classy girl a chance... and if you did, could you eventually end up loving her?

Ex best friend personality trait      She's a very talkative polite person everyone thinks shes a great person, doesn't seem into the superficial stuff.      However she doesnt have a lot of friends and says she perfers to be alone, even though she told me she really dislikes her boyfriend and uses hem because shes afraid of being alone(weird)      She loves to talk, when we were freinds she would talk about random people and how dumb and retarded they are behind there back but smile in there face. She would always talk to me at work but never call me unless i called her first. It seemed like she used me as a venting machine.      She always would brag to me about the mean things she did to people when they hurt her.   Yet at the same time she came of as a genuinelly kind person.    How would you some up this person?
20090226145900AAOqTBC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do? I need to know!?	OK so this guy I sit across from in Algebra used to hate each other but now I don't know. I mean, whenever I see him, like passing in the halls, I always end up running into things because I can't stop looking at him even after he passes me. And I always feel, I don't know light, like I'm floating or something when we talk. But here's the thing, 3 or 4 months ago my friend was talking to him and asked him if he would rather go out with me or spend the rest of his life in prison with an insane murderer named crazy wack-job Bubba, and he goes "Are you serious? Is that a serious question?" and he started laughing histarically. But today he leaned over the table in class and whispered something in my ear and after I answered he just kind of stayed there for about 10 or 15 seconds. It was kind of akward but I didn't say anything. My friend said that he kinda likes me, but another friend said he liked one of my other friends. What should I do? I think I like him. But I don't now if he likes me. What do you guys think? Sorry for this being so long

I enjoy the girl on girl action. Sometimes when my husband comes home finds the porn in the dvd player, or one of my toys out. Dont get me wrong we watch this stuff together. We have a great sex life so no worries there. But sometimes I see the look on his face and its no a good one, or maybe Im just looking at it the wrong way.       So my question is do you thinks this bothers him?
20090226145536AA4lhdl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do we get through a miscarriage?	Recently, my wife was pregnant with our first child and at 13 weeks she had a miscarriage. We were both really distraught about it (her the most but that is completely understandable). We were so happy about the pregnancy as we have been married 7 years and this was our first attempt at a family. I love my wife with all my heart and i want to show her this in a special way. I know it will take a long time for her to come to terms will the miscarriage and I will stand by her for as long as it takes. I suppose this was just natures way of saying that it wasn't right for us at the time but some day it will happen for us. Does anybody know any nice things i could do for her? Even just simple thing?

I got real mad a wrote this mean thing that i probably should have but you know when you get mad you kinda over react, but then the day i wasn't there she was all "up" on him. Also today, she likes this boy who i really don't like also he is also very ugly and she was like " awww he is so cute, i want to go out with him, but he goes out with cindy" and i was like "ewww he is very ugly and cindy and him make a good couple so" and then she was like " umm no he is so hot and me and him would be a better couple" and then i was like " I can have my own opion about people, and if someone should go out with someone else" then she just turned bright red and walked off giving me glares. also once she told her mom about how i didnt want her to come to my party and her mom made me and her have a meeting to work things out but i really dont want to work things out because i reallly dont like her and she needs to reliase that. What should i do, i only have about 4 mouths left of her because next year i will be at high school, and proably be at different schools. So please help me

20090226150052AAGjN5U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me, or is he using me?	So, let's just start off by saying I really like this guy.   One day at a basketball game I messaged my friend,   who was standing right next to the guy I liked and   we started talking about how hot the guy I liked was..      ..Well he read the messages and that night commented like,   3 of my pictures calling me beautiful, etc..      So, we talked and I was always the one who initiated the conversation.. And it really bothered me,   so I asked him about it and he replied, " Well, it's like this.. If you want   to talk to me, you can. But I don't want to bother you by texting you all the time... I've never texted a girl first."      And I was like, well... Okay..      Well, that weekend I told him I was open to hang out anytime and he said okay... But yet he NEVER messaged me to hang out.      So we're still talking and I invited him over to my house at 8PM   to watch a movie by ourselves. (parent's consent)   Well he said he was a little "out of it" if you know what I mean.   So I asked him, will you be back to normal at about 8?   and he said yeah.      Well 8 rolls around and he doesn't show up.. So I text him and   get no reply.. I call.. No reply.. Nothing.      I was really mad, and the next morning he texted me saying   "omg im so sorry i past out"      And I said "oh"      Well, a few days later.. He still doesn't text/ message me..   So I go "Predictable"   and he goes "what"   And I replied, "nothing"   and he said, "I'm not oblivious to why you are mad but I don't know how to fix it"      I didn't text back until today when I go,  "Sorry for flipping out on you the other day"   and he said "it's ok I knew you needed a few days to cool down."   ....   What do I do?   Does he really like me, or what?   I can't figure him out...
20090226145628AATg9JF	Family & Relationships;Friends	What if your guy friend has a crush on you but you dont like him back?	Well, my guy friend is a year younger than me and we have been friends for a month now and we txt each other everyday. Now im getting the feeling that he likes me. He does anything I ask him to do and when we were in a major fight that was all my fault he forgave me right on the spot. He is a really nice guy and I don't know what to do!
20090226142556AA7lT9p	Family & Relationships;Friends	Was I wrong with this?	I was bored so I texted my friend to see what she was doing. She told me "some guys were coming to her house for some drinks", and she asked if i wanted to go. I said "alright, how will i get there?" She offered a way, for these strangers to give me a ride, all men, so i said "no, im good. see you tomorrow." She texted me back saying she gave them my number and address so they could come get me. I was pissed and then we started to argue, and now we hate each other.       I didn't want these people to know where I live or to know my number cause i don't know them.       Did I do anything wrong? Was she wrong in what she did?      She is telling everyone its my fault and I am wrong for some reason.. Can you assure me it isn't my fault.      :] thanks.      Lily.
20090226145438AAVA5lj	Family & Relationships;Family	Am i wrong for thinking/saying this?	My parents have taken my half-brother's side (about the case where he raped me but he got 16 almost 17 years in prison in oregon state) Well they just found out that he got sentenced and they have been calling me off and on so far i counted 3 time's within the past 30min, i don't want to talk to them because they blame my sister for it when she has nothing to do with it, it was my choice to turn him in and he is going to pay for what he did to me. Am i wrong for doing/saying this? I feel i shouldn't even talk/see them anymore,even my counselor says the same. But when is it harassment?
20090226153720AA4zDtK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	There is this guy...I LIKE HIM.?	That I truely have a crush on. MAD crush. It's like crazy, I can't explain my feelings. I keep having dreams about him and just last night, I had this weird dream with me having a threesome with him and these other people. I don't even know why I'm getting these dreams when I'm not even mature enough to think about 'threesomes'. (14 yr old right here..)   We met 2 years ago at a school that we take on Saturdays. He use to have a crush on me along with his other buddy who I don't like. (they admitted it to me) I regret how I didn't have feelings for him back then, now it's too late. One year ago, he asked me out to a movie with him and his annoying buddy and I went. Nothing special really happened. We just watched the movie basically and left after.    Just suddenly, he quit the Saturday school we use to go to and that was when I find myself falling in love with this guy. I barely talk to him now. He only appears online msn once a while. The only problem is, I found out that he is like a son of a random millionaire in the city. Even though if I did get the chance to be with him, I would feel so awkward cus' hes the rich guy and I'm like a girl who lives in a ghetto community plus his parents would probably reject me for that. I don't even talk to him much now and If I told him that I like him suddenly, wouldn't it be awkward? He's only a year older than me. If I could, I would go to the school he goes to but the school fees are like out of my parent's budget! I can do anything now but regret and hide my feelings for him.

I seem to have the impression that the majority of men (especially those in a relationship) have some tendency to lie whether its necessary or not. Even if it makes no difference like about the little things.          I don't know, what do you think?   Do you reckon most men even realize they do this?

20090225114903AABU6oU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I told some guy that he looks like someone, and he got maybe a little flirty?	I went to an interview for Hard Rock cafe. The guy who interviewed me looked so much like Trent Reznor. He said thank you and that he took as a complement. I did mean as a complement and nothing more.       Then, he kind of starting to lean towards me as he spoke and it made me feel a little nervous. He was really hot, but I did not mean to do that.       If I get hired, he's going to think I want to hook up with him, and seriously, I do not. I just admire, but I do not sleep around with men, even if I didn't have a boyfriend and I really do not want this to make it feel like I'm cheating on my b/f. You know what I mean?      So, what's your opinion.      Maybe I should not have done that? Do you think my chances of getting the job will be weak?

20090226154552AAfZQOp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when your boyfriend doesn't call you pretty, but not ugly?	Okay my boyfriend and I have liked each other for a long time, and I mean since we were 9 or something. He has never said anything negative and he always tells me how much he hates it when I am away from him and cute little comments like that. But when it come to my looks I never try to look pretty I am to shy when it comes to my hair and my chest. I am an early bloomer so I am the only one in all my classes you stands out more then everyone else, I am a tomboy and usually I try to hide my chest. When I go to school, I sweat the most in gym.. its sucks. So I always have to tie my hair up, I do anyways. Is that why he doesn't think I am pretty, I know looks shouldn't count, but coming from him that means alot. And plus I have never been complimented on my looks.      Sorry its so long, its just I know he is the one, and I for sure dont want to dump him.. I just dont know what it means, nor do I know how to look prettier   Note: I dont wear make-up!

20090226144037AAbmScJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i right to be feeling a little jellous? or do i need to just get over myself?	Ok so, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 months and have been best friends for about a year. Last week he bumped into this girl who he hooked up with before he started dating me. They hung out together  for a few hours that day just to catch up and he went to give her a goodbye hug (which is quite normal for my bf, he hugs everyone including his guy mates) but then apparently she wouldn’t let go and then ended up cuddling for a few mins. I wasn’t to happy about that obviously but because he told me it happened I decided not to make a big deal about it. But since then they have been talking on the phone at least every second night but a couple of nights ago when I had phoned him he told me he needed to go and 9.30 so he could ring her. I was pissed off but once again, didn’t make a big deal out of it. Last night I tried to get through to ring him and I was engaged for like and hour and a half so I assume he was talking to her then too. And they are going  to hang out at the park or something on Sunday.       My boyfriend has always had a lot of girl mates and generally gets along with chicks pretty well. He also has chicks flirting with him and asking for his number pretty much every time he goes out but that has never bothered me before but for some reason his relationship with this chick is getting on my nerves. I have trust issues and I have just opened up to him and told him a whole lot of personal stuff that nobody else knows and I am going to be very, very hurt if something happens between the two of them because I have invested so much of myself in him. I just don’t know what I’m meant to do and how I’m meant to be reacting. Help anybody?

20090226150543AAVPr8E	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean if im able to chat up a girl without a profile picture?	Im 15 and i go on the networking site bebo. I took my pic off for like 5 Min's to upload a new pic and everytime i tried to upload a new pic it was declined. That's when i saw this really cute girl she was my age around 15. I talked with her all the time on msn and bebo and  managed to make her fall in "love with me" (that's what she said)without having a pic. She would post comments like everyday asking how i was and stuff. And she'd i was so charming and how she'd date a guy with a personality like me any day. But how is this possible i didn't have a pic id think she wouldn't talk to me based soley on that. I  kinda had her wrapped around my finger not in a bad way but in a good way like she couldnt go a day without seeing how i was.      Does this mean im charming if i got her to really want me even though i didnt have a pic? Girls are really superfiacial these days not all though most just rely on looks alone. And would you ever talk to some1 without a pic?      P.S i met her and were still going out now weve been going out for like 4 months now i think shes the 1.

20090226144544AAd7DiC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this guy likes me?	I've been good friends with this guy for a long time, and he's always liked me on and off. There was this one time I dated this one guy because me and the guy liked each other even though my friend liked me. Once me and my ex broke up he was there for me, and to make a long story short my ex charmed me into dating him again. Even though I went so long without liking my friend that liked me, and he always saw me going for other guys and in other relationships that weren't with him I'd imagine that would hurt... But he still stayed around me and here for me, then the last time I broke up with my ex he was pretty much there for me, and he called me all the time, and he called me on holidays which my ex bf didn't to wish my a good holiday, and now that I like him and I'm thinking of telling him I'm not really seeing much of him, and last night was the first time I actually caught him, we had been leaving each other offline messages, but last night he called and I was about to shower and he said he'd call back, and he never did? Also his phone calls have began to decrease.      The guy though, seems as if he's kinda been infatuated with me, he liked me for a very very long time no matter what I put him through, it was on and off, but he still stayed around for me and seemed to genuinely care, so what's yahoo answers finest opinions?

20090226154055AAwuYF1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like him but I think he likes someone else?	I've liked my friend for about three months. He's a senior, and I'm a freshman, and I had no intention of going out with him, because I knew that would never happen. But my friend went and told him that I liked him, and now he won't talk to me anymore. I asked him if we were okay, because I felt bad, and he said "not really, I still feel awkward". Now, by outside hints and clues, I am starting to find out that I think he likes one of my other really good friends. She's a junior. I know I shouldn't feel bad, because I never intended him to like me that way, I just wanted to continue being his friend. But even so, it still hits me hard. I don't understand, I don't try to make myself hurt by him liking someone else, but it still hits when I least expect it. And the worst of it is, I've almost lost him as a friend too. This has been going on for the past three/four weeks, and I don't know what to do. I'm not going to attempt to be friendly with him anymore, because he's refused the smallest attempts I've tried. I've tried to forget about him. Even against the fact that I see him like everyday, and he's in one of my groups of friends. But I can't stop thinking about him, and how it hurts unintentionally when I think about him liking someone else. What can I do? Any kind advice would be amazing, thanks!

20090225115803AATwr5T	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Divorce and property?	My son is getting a divorce.  We gave him a home/paid for. He gave half of the house to his fiancee before they married.  They both borrowed 60k on the house. My son deeded his potion back to us BEFORE the divorce papers were served. He did this to repay us for money we advanced him. Now we did not sign for his portion of the loan. Since we now have half the house how is that going to effect the title to the home.  The wife has left the home refusing to pay her half of the 60 k and refusing to deed over her portion of the house. She refuses to let us rent the house. Is foreclosure inevitable if these two don't pay up on the borrowed money?

20090225114021AAdryhp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Things moving too fast or just found the right girl?	I just met this girl in the hall on campus while studying a few weeks ago.  We started talking a lot since we'd be there at the same time.  I hadn't gone on a date with her, but only talked to her in that same hall twice a week and got her phone number and started texting her.  I had asked her out last week but she was going out of town this weekend.      Yesterday, things jumped a few levels during our casual studying in hall.  She wasn't minding me touching her face, head, putting my hand behind her neck going over her anatomy homework with her.  After a bit of joking and teasing, I put my arm around her and pulled her to me and she let me keep my arm around her, and then I saw her hand next to my hand that was around her shoulder, picked up her hand and we laced our hands together while sitting there.        We were trying to find a time that we were both free and she said she's checking her schedule and then going to text me.  I felt like things were moving to new levels without even going on a date.  Should I be concerned or just keep going with it? I really like this girl, and she seems to really like me, apparently.
20090226154451AA7N3UB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i give up and move on or keep on trying? PLEASE HELP ME!!!?	i talked to this girl everyday for 3 months. we werent going out but she was my bff. i know she was talking to like 3 other guys but even when she had a bf we still talked everyday. then when she broke up with him we became closer than ever. i was thinking about finally asking her out but then 4 days ago, on my b-day, she just stop talking to me. she called me at night and said happy b-day then said she had to go. that was the last i heard from her. i called her once and sent her one text the next day and never got an answer. i havent even tried since then so i dont get annoying. we have sooo much in common too, she even said she loved me the day before i last heard from her. this doesnt make any sense at all to me. PLEASE, your help would be greatly appreciated.
20090226144224AAd7b2u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm confused as to what's wrong. Anyone help?	I split up with someone in August of last year, and the relationship had some terrible moments. I was cheated on, and it really cut me deep. After that (Which happened in May) I carried the relationship, but I'd changed...   I never go a day, even now, wishing I could 'do terrible things' I'm not going to post to the lad I was cheated on with. Not only that, I now suffer random bursts of depression and I'm curious as to why. I'm completely over the relationship. I've been through self-harming and overdoses which I'm not proud of.      Can anyone suggest a way in which to help me? :/

20090225114855AAVS89j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get over a guy who's too old for you?...?	I'm a Freshman, and he's a Senior. Let's call him Bob.   He was in one of my classes first semester, and we've talked once and a while, and we ALWAYS smile at each other in the halls, and he even helped me when I was balling my eyes out.      Well, today I found out that he has a girlfriend. I'm heartbroken, and I even shed a few tears. I don't know if I actually liked 'Bob' or if it was a silly crush/lust. He's a Senior, which means he's graduating in May, and then he's going to college in another state. So I definitely know that a relationship cannot start.      Help me out here, I don't know what to do, he's just so cute!

So I just sent him a text saying I hope you got all that you wanted from me, I'm not a toy to be played with and I  wished him the best of luck. I haven't heard from him since he was ignoring me(3 1/2 weeks ago)until today. I'm not completely over him. Thanks for you input and thoughts/advice.

I'm taking a course in school on law, and we were talking about age of concents. I don't really understand it. If you in a state the age of concent is 16 does that mean that person can have sex with whoever he or she wants? So if you are 16 you can have sex with a 20 or 22 year old and that person can't get in trouble?

We used to talk to each other often and now not even close. I know her since elementary. At first I though she liked me but I though I wanted her as a friend. Now I think it's the other way around I have fallen in love with her. I think she's real pretty and funny. One of my friends asked me today If I like her and I asked him why he'd ask. He said somebody told him I like her and that he heard her say she knew I like her to somebody else and that somebody that likes but I don't is mad at the girl I like. To me I don't think she likes me but how can I be sure. I tried asking her out but I have chicken out. How can I ask her out? I t's not as easy as it looks to me so don't say just go up to her to ask her out.
20090226144401AAaDR7J	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok, I don't normally get a lot of responses but I really need help?	I've been seeing this guy since before Christmas break which was a little over a month now. A while before Valentines day he got sick. I gave him his space and I only texted him once or twice to see if he was feeling better. I didn't hear from him AT ALL for five days then he got in touch with me on Valentines day night but I didn't see the message until the next morning then he didn't respond to me until that evening. We had a long "conversation" (I use quotes because I'm not sure if it's a real conversation when you just text back and forth) and we went to see a movie the next day to make up for missing the real Valentines day. It was great.we even decided to spontaneously see a second one. Now he's being really weird. On Monday he like totally avoided me all day. He barely adknowledged my existance. He said that he just hadn't been getting a lot of sleep and he does have work to catch up with since he missed school. It's been getting better but I still feel a little neglected. In the mornings he's fisnishing homework from last night, isn't very pleasent and won't talk at all, then he usually leaves right after school so I can't see him then. I know he has his own life and I don't want all his time. Just a smile or someting that says "hey I'm glad you're here" I'm confused and I don't like it. I keep wondering what I'm doing wrong. I feel sad, I feel anxcious and it's just messing up my life. Am I being too sensitive? Should I not care? I don't know what to do? What would a good girlfriend do?
20090226145231AAdLyvM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys please help me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	every time i turn around this guy is staring at me and then he looks away and he talks to me sometimes does he like me or what
20090226145403AAjSaaW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I make the make a certain girl like me?	The other day I asked out this girl I really like. I've known her since September and we talk a lot. She rejected me because she doesn't want to risk our friendship. First of all, how can I persuade her into thinking that it won't ruin our friendship? I don't think that's the only reason. I don't think she thinks I'm good looking. How can I make myself attractive to her and other girls in school?
20090226145521AAZkO6k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Not in a relationship but seeing someone. Is it wrong to go on a date with another person?	I been seeing this girl for about 3 months. I care and like her very much. Even though I have strong feelings for her I am not ready to fully commit to her yet. I don`t want to rush things; If I am going to be in a relationship, I want in for the long term. So thinking that our feelings were mutual (about the relationship) I told her that I am going to hang out with a girl I used to like and she got really upset. What do you guys think? Is it wrong?
20090226145623AAWwNKx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Jealous of best friend?	Okay, so...a few months ago, I began cutting my wrists. But, I kept it a secret, and only two people knew. Daniela, and Natalya (My best friend). Two days ago my best friend Natalya cut her wrist. I think she wanted attention so she told, and showed very many people. They were always talking about her all the time, and then today, she cut her other wrist, but only one stroke, because Jesse asked her to. Now even more people are talking about it, and I think I'm jealous that she's getting so much attention for doing it. I am emo, and the cuts don't hurt. She isn't emo, and the cuts do hurt her. I keep on telling her to stop, but she never listens. When I cut myself, I didn't show anyone, and there were no rumors. And now she does it, and gets so many people talking about her. I think I want attention, but at the same time I don't like lots of attention...what should I do..?      No rude comments please.   If you don't like emos, that's you're problem.   Thanks.
20090226145829AAPcmxg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't want to french kiss my boyfriend, what do i tell him?	Okay, so me and my boyfriend have been going out for a couple weeks now and I can tell he's ready to french kiss me and i don't like it and i don't want to. Im afraid if i tell him he will break up with me and think i don't really like him and he's almost three years older than me.   What should i do? Should i tell him? How do i tell him? Thanks.
20090226145836AAtJJEv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I chat with my ex or just wait until she initiates contact?	My ex and I have been broken up for 4 months. Since the break up we have had very little contact. My communication with her has been absolutely brutal since we broke up, and she has stayed off chatting with yahoo for the past 2 months to avoid me. About a month ago she started to come back online and because I knew she wanted space I did not say Hi for a week. Every day she came online and everyday we both never budged. Finally I caved and we had a very awkward conversation. The next day I emailed her a couple times and then tried calling....I know, I know...stupid...I then asked her if we could be friends again on facebook since I had deleted her to help myself heal. She wrote me back that she would like to be friends someday but not just yet considering how I still love her. So for over a month she has been offline and I have not replied to her email about not wanting to be friends. I just responded to her email by written letter yesterday. Today she comes online for the first time in over a month. Again, neither of said anything. I feel I need to let her come to me here and I'm afraid if I make the first move I will come across as smothering her all over again. Any advice?
20090226145858AAr5H95	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like to be used sexually from my boyfriend of 8 months...?	I know you will probably think this is bad but I am submissive and let my boyfriend take it whenever he wants. I get orgasms from it he calls me all types of names during sex and I enjoy it. I don't like making love during sex it bores me.And turns me off. Is that normal? If not..why? I like molestation fantasies too. He'll come in and force me to like it...and I just lay there submissively and do as I'm told until I reach orgasm.
20090226150131AAvs5mD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get over my ex??? HELP.?	Ok so even after everything I went through with my ex, I still love him. I want to hate him so bad but I just can't!   Even when I found out he got this girl I know whos my friend, pregnent before he went out with me(I just found out a few weeks ago), it was both their faults, they were drunk, it was a mistake, but I still can't!   Even though he was a piece of shiz, I always remember the sweet things, like kissing me in the rain, playing guitar and singing for me, and so on, and not the bad things.   Like how he, well I'm guessing he planned it out to be alone with me, he got me to skip school with him. And his friend couldn't drop me off at my house so he left me on the street, told me he loved me like i told him eariler, so my parents could pick me up & he didn't want them to see I was with him.   I broke up with him about a month ago because there were just so many lies and he would randomly be gone for two weeks.   Like for example he said he was on phone restricition and couldn't call. Probably a lie.   When I first went out with him, his ex gf, who was like crazy in love with him warned me about him saying he lied, did horrible things, left, and was amazing and pure hell at the same time.      I think about him constantly still. I got a bf right after him(we just broke up) thinking I wouldn't love him still. Wrong.   He was also my first boyfriend.    And today when I saw him...he began purposly i think, going over to the lunch line where i walk by. But he ignores me.   Today I was walking by and he saw me, i looked away, and when i looked back, he was hugging some girl and looking at me.   He probably still likes me but i CANNOT be with him.   When I went to class my hands were shaking. :/      Help??

20090226152216AAWIN8Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this Game or just Lame?	I have a lady friend, who knows I like her, ask me out twice. The first time she asked, I declined because I had a long day and didn't have any money. The second time, I said okay but we ended up not going out because she wanted me to meet her over somebodies house and was not too clear about what was going on.    Now last week, I text her to see what she's into and she does not respond. The next day I do the same thing and she does not respond again. Now knowing the type of guy I am, I stop texting her all together. is this wrong. She knows I'm feelin' her but I don't dig games. I have not tried to contact her and I have not heard from her since last week. I'm beginning to think that it's best if I leave her alone. What should I do?
20090226152334AA53Quc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I care about him, but can't commit. How do I convince him that I really do care?	It's complicated. Not like every relationship isn't complicated, but wow. This one's pretty weird, haha.   Anyway, we've been weirdly attached for a while now, hooking up, talking to one another, granted, half of it being under the influence. I care about him in that I want him to be safe and happy and yes, I am attracted to him. But there are certain things I don't like about him, and I am scared he will get angry and sad and make a huge deal if I agree to a relationship only to mess up and cause these feelings for him. I can't commit. And I know he's going to be angry about it since he really likes me. He's accusing me of not caring at all, and I don't know what to say to him to make him believe it.    I'm not even sure it's possible to pinpoint.    Has anyone been in a situation where they care very much for someone but have never really thought about why? How would you describe it to them now?   Is there anything I can say without making an even bigger mess?   Thanks in advance :)

20090226154106AAEhP7n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend's ex is still getting mail at his house.?	I am conducting a poll to find out if my feelings are based in insecurity or if this would be acceptable behavior in most relationships. He is a good guy & I really do want to be fair. He has been honest with me when I ask him anything directly.      We have a good relationship, but I don't want to ignore red flags either. They went out for 8 years and broke up about 1-2 years ago. We are both in our mid/late 30's.      The issues that I am struggling with are as follows:       -His ex is still getting mail at his house after over a year   -He hides my things when she comes over   -He has a  photo of them kissing on the mantle   -She has her stuff stored there   -She keeps several pairs of slippers there (they are there when you walk in the house)   -He keeps a hand made mug that he made for her in the house (before we met) that reads that he loves her (she leaves it out for me  to see each time she comes over)   -He brings her up almost daily   -She went to his house on Valentine's Day & he did not tell me about it (they exchanged gifts).   -He states he feels bad when she won't return his calls.       Is this relationship worth pursuing at this stage of the game or am I just setting myself up to get hurt? We have been going out for almost 1 year and seriously for over 6 months.

20090226114854AAqhuYo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I hate this fcking guy ! Am I wrong to ?	He is a player, and there is this woman in our class that is always so upbeat, strong, and respectable. She has character over all, but today she was really depressed and sad, and looking aimless for effection, and this player guy who goes on one date sex nights exchanges numbers with her...      He says something like " You look kind of depressed, call me if you want to talk about it ". She says "thank you, thank you, thank you.."      I so hate this guy, I am not a avid womans right supporter or anything,, feminist, but I hate this guy,      She was vulnerable, hurt, and that hurts him on, because he cant get enough of using, abusing women for their insecurities , and feelings .      If she was upbeat and they wanted sex I would be fine with it, but praying on the weak is just sick .

20090226154955AAz9ApX	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to do deal with an EX-friend bullying you?	I stopped being friends with her because I'm tired of her crap and she is too bossy. She always wants to change me, and she tries to separate me and my mom because me and my mom are really close, and she doesn't have a good mom, so she wants to take away mine.   So I ended it nicely with her, and ever since then, she won't leave me alone. Whenever she walks pass me, she keeps hitting my shoulder with her shoulder. It's so annoying. But I just ignore it. And when she sees me having a good time with my friends, she always walks past me in the hall calling me mean names. She calls me fish eye (because I have really big eyes) and ugly.   Today I went in the bathroom and she was in there, ALONE! So we were both in there all by ourselves. And she always feels like she has to say something snotty when she's around me. I don't know why she thinks its necessary. I don't say anything to her. I don't even look at her.      And she keeps bugging me to give her stuff back (the stuff she gave to me when we were friends), and everyday she's like, "You better give me my stuff back," She says it like she's gonna beat me up or something. So today in the bathroom, she hits me and says, "You better give me my stuff back," and I totally snapped! I shouted, OMG, LEAVE ME ALONE! YOU WILL GET YOUR FREAKIN STUFF BACK! YOUR GETTING ON MY NERVES!" and her eyes got really big when I did that and then she starting shouting, and I just walked out.      What do I do? What is the right thing to do when your being harassed in the hallway? If I report her, it's just gonna make things worse.

20090226155122AAEVMlD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Household chores (married) -- how to share and deal with it?	Hi, this is my story. I am 20 years old and my Wife is 21. I am British, she is American. I moved here to be with her, we have been married since August 2008. (I'm being brief with it to skip to the point.) We are very happily married, i just got my green card approved. We live with my Wife and my mother and sister in law. Her Mom loves me like i am her own son, it's great.      However... household chores... i've found myself tonight doing the dishes for the 3rd night in a row, and i have no problem taking the hit for my Wife, i've had a week off of work and she's been hard at it all day. But my sister-in-law NEVER does dishes, we'll force her once every month, and that'll be it for the month. How do we work on this?      She leaves her garbage all around the house, and it's doing my brain in! I'm a very clean and responsible person, and if i leave mess out overnight, i always take care of it in the morning. She doesn't! How do i work on this? My Wife has spoke to her but she just gets extremely defensive.. we've even tried piling her garbage into one pile and putting it inside her room so she can see what she's doing, but she doesn't care!      Does anyone have any ideas on how we can split the chores up? My Wife and I work by our work schedules, if one's hard at work with longer hours, the other takes care of things. My Wife is the main cook however, every day of the week.      We are going to be moving out within this year, but until then, i need to keep my sanity and be tidy!      Thanks in advance,      Hydey

20090226170740AAGzrao	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this the right thing to do?	I have this friend named Jenna. I have been friends with her for about five years now and we always have so much fun together. Well, recently, I have been noticing that she doesn't treat me that well. She says a lot of mean things to me. For instance, I have really bad face acne. She had one pimple on her face and was complaining about it. Then she looked at me and said, "Well, at least it not nearly as bad as your face." Then today, she told me my outfit went out of style five years ago and nobody wears it anymore. Whenever we disagree on something, she is always right. She puts me down. Once, she told me I looked like a stick because I didn't have curves.      I decided that I don't want to listen to her anymore. Especially after today. I went outside to walk my dog and I ran into this girl I know from school. Her and I were like acquaintances. When we ran into each other, we started talking. We ended up sitting down in some random person's yard and we talked for hours about everything. She was so nice, friendly, and easy to talk to! It made me think that Jenna is not really a good friend and she takes advantage of me.       I decided to quit talking to Jenna. If she wants to be my friend, then she has to come talk to me. If she does, then we can work things out. But only if she comes to me and actually notices that I have stopped talking to her. Is this the right thing to do? I just want to see if she actually wants to be my friend. Thanks!

Anyway, I've been wanting to call her and see how she was doing, but is 3 weeks too soon for that? Is that a bad idea in general?      We've broken up many times before, and we always end up back together because as soon as I go to pick something up, she makes me feel guilty, so I get back with her. This time, I made sure I had everything so I could avoid seeing her again, but I still feel guilty, so I guess what I want is some closure, to make sure she's alright on her own...?      Personally, I don't think she really cared about me. I think she only stayed with me because she didn't want to be alone. That's what makes me worry she's not alright being on her own... and worrying that she might not be moving forward is making it difficult for me to move forward.

20090226162446AArWCDn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A question about rape?	This question is not out of disrespect, first off.   I just think about how much it would hurt an offender's penis if he tried to penetrate when the woman obviously wasn't wanting it therefore she'd be unready.. and, you know.   I know it's often about control, but wouldn't that be an unpleasant experience for the offender (of course as well as the victim)?   If my husband tried to penetrate me and I was bone dry it just wouldn't work too well??!   It seems when you hear about rapes, the offender easily puts in in?      I know this has nothing to do with relationships in the marriage/dating sense but there is no sexuality column.
20090226102232AActVUA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Met this female bartender?	There's a restaurant next door. I ordered food to go but had to order at the drinking bar. A very young waitress kindly took my order and sparked a conversation. We talked about the economy and business and how everyone has been affected.       I don't think she was just being nice. There was a lot of eye contact. She kept walking around the bar, passing me as I stood waiting for my food. She occasionally glanced at me, made sure I was ok, etc. She even preened her hair. Was a little stiff walking by. When talking, she maintained eye contact... so did I... and she blinked several times. No matter what, she kept talking and talking and talking. It kept going and going. Most bartenders I met, don't really do this.       Can anyone explain her behavior?    Thoughts?

20090226115123AAAc3oP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is going on in his head?	my estranged husband and I separated in Aug he took it very very hard, moved back in w/ his grandmother and is still there, he has made no effort to get an apt of his own even though he works full time and makes enough to do so. Back in Dec I decided I wanted to give it another shot w/ him, he agreed and everything was great for a week or so, then outta nowhere, after we spent the night together he tells me that he's 'dating' someone, but it's not serious, yada, yada, yada. Next time I talked to him he said it was and he wanted to see where it goes w/ her, even though he still loves me?!? I asked if he just wanted it to be over for us and he immediately says "NO no no, I'm not saying that at all, I just need time to think, YOU"RE the one who initiated this to begin with remember?"      The extent of his 'relationship' with this girl is meeting at a bar and getting drunk together, we still talk and he says he wants to see me, but it's not a good idea right now b/c he is seeing someone. Meanwhile he carries my pic around in his wallet and has framed pics of us up at his house where he stays now.

20090226160727AAoVPJ1	Family & Relationships;Friends	"Sweet" names and stuff?	Yeah, so, I think the whole relationship thing is really disgusting and I will never be one of those girls from the movies who is totally into some dude. But I have a friend who is a guy and I can't bring myself to use his real name, and idk what to call him. So I figured I'd throw him off guard and pretend to be sweet some day when I need money in the game we play.      Anyway, he's pretty much like me. He's a dick, he's all sarcastic, but he's nice to me, yeah, he lets me yell at him. But he gets really angry, like the Hulk. Maybe i'll just call him "Hulk" (well, that's really gay, nevermind).  Uh, he has a pretty cool voice and a hilarious personality (in my opinion, everyone else hates him). Um, we do everything together, he's really domminant to everyone (you know, except me).      He totally digs me though, so, yeah. He calls me his hunny bunny. Idk how to describe him ugh he likes to exercise and his tis-tos-ter-rone is obnoxiously high, I'm waiting for him to have a stroke. Maybe I'll call him stroke

20090226103309AAPIljM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did my ex do this? *this is the last time I will ask, i promise)?	2 nights ago he called and was being really sweet and we talked for about 2 hrs. Then he finally ask me if I would ever hook back up with him, meaning would i be in a relationship. I told him prob. not bc we are in 2 different places in life. I want to keep my virginity and he wants to rush things and have sex very quickly. I mean after he dumped me, he went right to another girl and lost his virginity with her within 2 wks. This was one of the reason why we broke up. Not bc he cheated on me but he hounded me for sex the entire time we were together and I simply wasn't ready, and it was getting to the point that he made me feel bad bc i wasn't ready. The thing is that he did this like in the very beg. of the relationship.      So last night he called me and asked me was i close to my comp. I was like yeah. He said, could you log into this dating website and type in this girl's name. I want to see what she looks like. I was soo outraged bc he simply could have made up a fake account and found the person. While I am a part of that particular website, don't you find it strange and just crazy that he'd call ME and ask me to log in so I can look at some girl for him. Especially when he has his on comp. and internet.      Why did he do this? I keep seeing this pattern over and over.      He asks me to date him about every month and when i say no.. he does something crazy. Like last month he called me and started crying about his ex gf. Now him and I have only been seperated since OCt. and I make it a point to not call him. Heck, I don't even now if he was seriously crying bc afterwards he asked me again would I go back out with him, and the thing about it is that him and the other girl were together in Dec. and HE called me asking  if i would him give another chance.      How crazy is that? and the thing is that he was the one who dumped me and said i was crazy and that he didn't want 2 hear from but called 3 days later.      what is wrong with him and btw we're young adults. 20 and 21

20090226105415AAcKBvb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok, MEN, LADIES RELATIONSHIP QUESTION?	Ok so I've known this guy for about year, everything was good. In the beginning he was like, he wasn't looking for a relationship ( not ready/stable I guess) and I was like "whatever" on the whole thing. If I got into one, I got into one, but I wasn't searching for a man. So, as it progressed, we both stated that we had an attraction for one another, and by this time, I was wanting a little more, maybe towards the last 2 months I was thinking of wanting more.I didn't tell him that, but he knew that I had started to have some sort of feelings for him. Anyway, We flirted a bit, but we were just "friends", we talked a little sexually a bit, however, we were still "friends." It was a very odd thing that was going on between us. There was never any force on my end. I probed him just a bit to see where his head was and that was about it. Later on, he saying things like "these are things that should only matter to the two people..." (it was a trust thing), he sorta tried to turn it around on me, but I let him know that I wasn't going for it. He'd say things like "you're the only person who can pick up my phone." and that talking to me is refreshing and that it makes him happier... yada yada yada and I'm like WTH??? You're confusing me! He asks me if I have other males that I speak with, blah blah blah...AND then just recently, maybe around the end of January, I get no phone calls for about 2 weeks and I'm like ok, well maybe he's busy, then I start to think, NO, if he can't just text a hello...Then around early Feb, still no call, so I "fake text" a friend and "accidentally" text him, FINALLY he responds and we have a really nice little chat! ok, that was Feb 10th. I call on 13th, only to learn his phone goes straight to voicemail and continues to do so ever since, BTW he uses his cell for his work, cuz I don't think he has a landline. So, this wasn't typical of his behavior (not calling, straight to voicemail etc...) so I text him a couple of times and I sent him a couple of emails because I was concerned. He finally responds to my email saying he's just "busy" with school, yada yada yada (who hasn't heard that one?) and that it's good to hear from me... By this time, I'm like what the hell is going on? In my email I explain to him that I was concerned about him (his well being), but I also mention that I feel like something is really off about all of this, of course he doesn't respond to ANY OF THAT, lol. So, my being confused, his fickleness, and feeling like I'm second fiddle to everything else. I told him in an email that, if he can't jet off a hello every once in a while, then it's safe to say that maybe he wants out of the friendship, that he either takes me for granted or just doesn't see our friendship as a priority and I said that if any of what I've said rings true, I told him to take care of himself, because I don't have the time nor the patience to deal with fickle friends, but that I'd leave my door open should he decide otherwise and that lately I'd been feeling as if this was going one-way instead of it being a two-way street.      My question in all of this is WTH happened???? and did I do the right thing? Will distance make him realize his mistake of pulling away? He's a really great person, despite his ambivalence about things. IDK, I just want some feedback. BTW, we live in different states.
20090226161248AAdO3XD	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Can any indian answer this please?	I work in US. I was introduced to a girl by showing her picture while I was in US. By looking at the picture I was bit concerned about her looks. After my parents gave me their view on her looks after seeing her in person I decided to make a positive decisions on this proposal. Also I had spoken couple of time before I made the decision. While I was in US, engagement date and marriage date was finalized. Marriage is in May while engagement is on Sunday march 1st. This girl was very nice to talk to and sounded very homely and very well cultured. But considering the positive comments that was given to me about the girl look, I was hoping for something better than what I had seen over the picture. I met her 2-3 times from past week and found that she is indeed nice to talk to and very homely and very well cultured. Also well educated from a cultured family who are distinct relative for my mom. But I am unable to accept her looks. She has bit dark completion and look bit older to me. How much ever I try I have difficulty moving  on by accepting her looks. Due to this I am unable to give my best to her. While I was in India I use to feel like talking to her all the time, now its just the reverse. Engagement is on March first and no way it can be called off…!!!!   Also from past few meeting with her I have realized that, she likes me a looooot...!!!!    My only request for you all is to  give me some suggestion though which  I could overcome this uncertainty  and give her the best and accept her whole heartedly.   Thanks and looking forward to your response…

20090226115021AAJUCsa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know if the guy likes you back?	ok so this guy has been extra nice to me ever since. I am two years older than him but he was never juvenile. I sometimes think he is more mature than most guys older than me. He has always listened to my opinions about things, helped me carry my bag (a heavy one with a laptop), made sure i go home safely, and stuff like that. I did not want to assume anything because as I said, he may do this because he respects me but I sometimes get the feeling he may like me as much as I like him. I am scared to ask him or anything because there's this mutual respect we have for each other and it may be ruined if i did something stupid. someone, any opinion? thanks.

20090226100231AAUBrZS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whos at the wrong, me or my guy?	He asked me a few weeks ago if we had plans for the 28th, I said no. Following day he asked again because another couple is inviting us out and were the only couple they are inviting to celebrate her guys B-day. I told him nope I dont have plans. Well, a week later my son he's 18 told me he has a performance on that date. I told him Im sorry but I had already given my word and I have plans that day, my son understood, However, my kids live with thier father and I only have them every other Wknd and thats my wknd, I dont like going anywhere when my kids are here. I made an exeption for this wknd, mind you Im missing my sons performance cause I gave my word to the other couple which our date with them is at night, now they are asking my boyfriend if we can go earlier in the evening that day to have drinks before we leave. I told my B/friend that it was not a good idea because thats taking more time away from my kids that wknd and he's upset because 1. He asked me in advance if we had plans for this occation and 2. I should have kept track of my kids wknd dates. I feel like I'm not wrong, I gave him my word and I'm gonna miss my sons performance for this dinner and yes I do have my kids that wknd but THEY are my priority and if he wants to join them for drinks earlier I told him to go ahead and go and I will meet them later at night like we planned, that way I can have most of the day with my kids:) Am I wrong?

20090226114012AAd1TcN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, how often have you ever seen this?	The stance a girl uses so she can confuse a guy and slap him where she'll have her weight to ones ide and have a hand placed on her hip, so the guys frozen, then slap him hard with the other hand, how many times have you seen a female use that? Or have you yourself, ever used it? I had a babe who used it on me, and it worked. I woulda blocked her hand, but you can't. There's like, no way to. If you have seen it, or done it personally, WAS the guy able to block that move?

20090226160757AAA6FD9	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why can't I learn to shut the f**k up?	Firstly I will admit I talk a lot. Reason being is when I talk I feel i need to explain myself all the time. Its one of those never gets to the point until 10 minutes later so it seems to my family and family friends but they make it so dramatic as im actually not that bad I do finish convoy's quick but sometimes with my words it takes me longer to explain.      It peeves everyone I know off, im made out to be the dumb one on the family when im actually very bright and only have my moments [mostly when i don't realise it as it goes]. I have knowledge but they don't see it! It annoys me im being branded as something from my own family when they have no idea and when introduced other people, don't give them a chance to get to know me before the blonde moment stories come out. Its so bad and I feel I push people away as they have no idea so I don't bother with them anymore.      I can't say one thing to my family before I get told by my sister to shut up for one little thing. She acts so above me and ex-friends have noticed that before. Im always getting talked down to and sick of it, am 19 and get treated the youngest like what the hell! People seem to be drawing further away from me.............in this confusing and rather evil world can anyone tell me whats going on??

20090226105739AAxRLlS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please please help.....is not calling him the right thing to do....?	I moved to a new state with my boyfriend who I am very in love with. I was/am financially dependent upon him but I have a job. He is 32 I am 22. He recently lost his job and went home to visit. He was there for three weeks, came back for four, then went home again a week ago. He said he would only be gone for a few days, not to worry.       He got angry when I asked him when he was coming back. He almost never answers his phone since he has been gone and makes excuses not to talk to me. He says he has no money left and has no idea when he is coming back. I have bills coming and I am very upset but I can't stop calling him which makes me feel helpless and probably makes him feel in control. I decided to turn my phone off and not talk to him anymore. I left my friends, family and school to move away with him and he acts put out when I simply ask him when he is coming home.       I feel like he has abandoned me here. Is turning my phone off and not talking to him the right thing? I feel upset and lose control everytime I talk to him because he treats me like a child. PLEASE help me here.

20090226103529AAM4RBb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex BoyFriend...What do you think?	My ex boyfriend and I were on and off for 11years, we would hook up then break up for a couple years and he would get with peolple and so would I. When we were together he used to cheat on me terribly. I would find letters, pictures, numbers, even girls calling and coming over, and I stayed for so long I thought I was so in love with him, he was my first boyfriend.    I was soooooooo in love with him. And last November of 08, we went out on a date to a local bar, he got upset took me back to his place we had sex and he said he was going back to the bar and would be back later. I got mad, went back to the bar and he was hangin out with a girl. I tried to call her out, but he got mad and hit me. Now this girl is his girlfriend and they just had a baby. He only knew her for a year.   But he keeps calling me, I was so hurt, he has always treated me disrespectfully, lies, and cheats. But still wants to talk to me, you have to understand that I was 19 back when I was in love with him , I am 27 now. And I feel like I have never gotten over him, I feel like I still want him, even though we didn't talk for like 5 years and I had 3 children in a seperate relationship. But I have never felt the same about a man like I did and still do about him.          What should I do? Please don't be rude. I do not see this man, I rarely think about him. But when he calls all my old feelings come rushing back. And he called today, and I almost started crying and I told him, "What do you want from me? Would your girlfriend be happy if she knew you were calling me?" He sad no.   I told him I could not just be friends with him, and that if he didn't want to be with me then he needed to stop calling me. He said he could respect that.    But I know he will call again.      P.S. I am in a current relationship with my babies daddy.      I'm just really lost.      Thanks for your help.

20090226100310AAUwoZC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like this girl.. (im in high school)?	Before i start, PLZ NO RUDELY NEGATIVE RESPONCES.   Ok, so, im a 9'th grader in high school, & i really like this one girl. Now, she is very popular, & i am not too popular, but i am friends w/ some popular people. But anyways, i really like her. So, does anyone know any ways i can get her to notice me or like me, because i believe she likes another guy. Also, please tell me what these signs mean: I sometimes catch her starring @ me, and when i do, we look @ eachother in the eyes directly for a few seconds, then both look away. Also, we sometimes talk on facebook but not often. bu, for example, when my status says i'm sick, she says somethin like awwwwwwww. Also, if i pass her in the hallway, she seems to try to look the other way, but always ends up looking @ me. & her friends got her to walk around the cafeteria by my table twice in a row & she looked nervous. + her 1 friend always tries to get her to say somethin on facebook when i comment on her pics. So what do these things mean? Also, the other day, me & her were both late to spanish & everyone started saying ohh look, ricardo (my nickname) and alexa were both late.. and people were asking her if she liked me & stuff, & idk if this is cuz i was sittin rite there or not, but she said no, but in a uneasy or nervous way, & she kept glancing @ me. But anyways could you possibly tell me what all this stuff means & help me find ways for her to like me or notice me? Also, how could I approach her & talk to her? Please help me! Thank-you!

20090226162832AAMcJZw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is he acting like this -- what gives?	Okay so I am married and have been for just 2 years but together for a total of 10 years. I have a very close guy friend that I have been friends with for quite some time. However, something happened recently and I am unsure what to make of it. Me and my husband sometimes have issues because he likes to go out a lot and I allow him because I don’t want to cause fights and I know he does deserve to have fun although last year there was an incident that gives me reason to not trust him because he was caught red handed doing something wrong but I chose to forgive him and move on.    In any event my best guy friend does know about this because I needed someone to talk to and vented to him at the time. Well the other night my guy friend asked how me and my husband were doing I said we are okay you know that my husband still likes to go out a lot but you know things are ok. Well my friend then kind of went of on me he said the following to me in a way of a rant in a bit of a feisty voice:      “You are a dream wife. But you know what in this case especially if someone wants to take advantage of you I think things are your fault to because you don’t yell at your husband and tell him he can’t go out and question what he was doing. You know you aren’t his property that he can think he can just put you up on a shelf to wait around while he goes out and has fun and then take you down from the shelf whenever he needs you for minute. Your not just something on the floor for him to step over or through in the wash machine whenever he feels. You know I see you 30 years down the line in the same situation still married to him meanwhile he has had 3 kids with other women and bunch of diseases and your still going around like “tra la la la la” I know you won’t admit it but you are just to afraid to leave, I know you love him but I know your not happy but you are just to scared to leave him. You never will. And I am telling you this because I don’t want you to ever say to me “well you never said anything” because honestly if your husband isn’t listening when you tell him how you feel well then he is just stupid”      Since then he has been distant and ignorning me when I text him so yesterday I gave him a hard time about ignoring me I was just trying to be silly and he responded and said "What do you mean ignorning you? And last I checked your husband was "name"      What is up with him? I don't understand why he is being so hard on me and doesn't seem to want to be my friend?

20090226161314AAXC6mG	Family & Relationships;Friends	How come girls cant seem to like me more than friends.?	It's like I have so many girls that flirt and tease me at school and I fit so nice with people but I can never seem to get a girl to like me more than a friend. Sometimes they make it seem like its impossible. I remember chilling with my friend this one time and were walking down the street. she's cute and we were flirting so much and just teasing each other. Her friend tailed us like a third wheel, while after we'd told her we were just friends so many times, her little sister kept saying "you guys are acting like girlfriend and boyfriend." later on the guy at walgreens asked us if we go out and she said. "NO!" in a way that sorta' embarrased me but I just smiled and asked her why she had to say it like that. LOL. WHY!?

Looking at postings like male 4 woman or MW 4 W (couple 4 woman) what would you think???      This is what happened, I came over to my girlfriends house, I got on her computer, I was looking for a page that I was  recently on, so I scrolled through her history, and I came across craigslist postings in the casual encounters section ( which is NO Strings Attached sex section) that she was looking at . These were postings from guys wanting to hook up with a woman for a "casual encounter" There was another one that she looked at, where a couple was looking for a single woman to hang out with.       when I confronted my girl, she says that it does not show intent, but I disagree, can we get some feedback from the community on this one
20090226101538AAoxLqj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he mad at me???? PLEASE ANSWER!?	He trusts me alot and this year we just started being friends (I just met him) He trusts me. One day at lunch he first sat next to his ex girlfriend and then there was a seat next to me and he just moved and sat next to me for lunch. I talk to him alot. Then one day he sat with us but was really quiet the whole time. I siad are you ok you're really quiet and he said yeah. But he flirts with his ex girlfriend alot. Then when we got back he was in the back of the room. I asked him if he likes his ex girlfriend and he shaked his head. Then I said alot? he said yeah. But he's starting to act like he's mad at me now. He's really nice still but he use to come up to me for hugs and now I have to go up to him. He's always with his ex. Now when he sits at our table he sits all the way on the other side like not near me. Before when we were like really good friends people woould ask if we were dating and I would always denie it. Then one day he was sitting in a desk and I hugged him (when we were still good friends) and this kid came up and was like are you to going out I said shut up and then he asked again and I said shut up and left. And the guy did nothing! He just didn't say anything. After that he started not talking to me maybe even during.

My boyfriend used to call me every day while I was at work.  I LOVED IT.  Now he has apparently decided that it isn't important to do that anymore, and I have to email him or call him after I get off work or we don’t see each other.  And get this:  If I don't call him, he gets upset with me.  He’s got some weird notion that things are supposed to 50/50 equal in a relationship, but I don’t agree.  I’M THE GIRL.  He is supposed to be calling me!  When I call him, it makes me feel desperate.        How do I get him to share the calling responsibilities again without directly asking, because come on, asking for someone to call you is like asking someone to buy you flowers - what's the point, right?  I want to coerce him in to wanting to call me more.        Help!

20090226101305AAiu2jA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it a conrol thing?	my boyfriend moved in with me 3 months ago.  We are not engaged.  We have been spending ALL our time together and have had a few big arguments over his ex.  I needed a break so went out after work with a girlfriend from work - I had to give her a ride anyway - let me BF know as he was already home and had picked up my son for me.  I was home by 8:00.  He copped an attitute about me being out drinking with friends and him being home.  He made a comment about how he doesnt' even have kids so why should he be stuck at home.  My son is old enough to be home alone (15yrs) so he didn't have to. Then he referred to how he was so lonely and doing things alone during his marriage which is why he wanted out now he was alone again and he was always the one going out and leaving his wife at home and he's not use to the reverse role.  He said he always knew she was sitting home waiting for him and I'm not like that.  It's been months since I went out alone with my friends, should I feel guilty?  Did I really do some awful thing to hurt him?  Is it a control thing?

20090226103731AAveL3j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What can I do???????	First of all, I'm 14 and hes 16 and I can't 'legally' date till i'm 17. So i've known this guy since about the beginning of december {so about 3 months}. And on new years day, i got in trouble {no phone for 2 weeks} for texting a guy they don't know, and wasn't allowed to text him anymore. {great way to start off the new years!} do ya think I followed that rule?! so ever since i've known him, he has stollen my heart with the things he says to and about me. Then just tuesday night {2 nights ago}, I was at my sisters bball game and he played right afterwords and so he was there too! so I snuck outside and he met me at my car, we hugged for a little bit, talked abit, staired into each other eyes, and then I put a keychain in his hand that was in the shape of a key and it had a heart at the top. kinda like he has the 'key to my heart'! So we've talked about kissing and all, and he knows that he'll be my first kiss, so right after I gave him the keychain, he couldn't stop smiling, and he pulled me close, staired into my eyes, and before I knew it, we were kissing!!! Then he pushed me away real quick and he behind some cars. And little did I know, my dad was walking up to us. So I made up some excuse of not being able to find what I was looking for. But my dad knew the real reason that I went out there. So I confessed. and the whole ride home, I didn't say anything, neither did he. so when we got home, I went to my room and my parents followed me in there. they were telling me that if I had asked to see him, they wouldn't care {whatever! total lie!}. so I confessed to everything, about how I was texting him when I shouldn't have been {there rule}, and about how we've snuck off during other games, that we've hugged and all.   Part of Our conversation;   my parents: couldn't you wait till your 17 to start dating?      me:I'M NOT DATING. WE JUST LIKE EACH OTHER, THATS ALL.   {alittle while later}      my parents: so how long have you two been going behind out back?      me: uh idk. we've only seen each other like a few times      my parents: We won't be able to like him like we could have.      me: he is going to wait for me till I can date, and he gave me his word.      my mom: DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE HIM??? HE IS A STUPID AND LYING BOY.      me: uh no he isn't. he hasn't told me one lie, and I trust him 100%. and I care about him very much.      My parents wern't too happy I said that and i'm not going into further details.      But I didn't say that we kissed or anything because my parents would freak! So my punnishment is that I can't text anyone-anymore, I can't use the phone anymore {includes if friends call me}, can't hang out with friends anymore, I can't be out of there sight if were in publc, and i've lost all of there trust. Terriable punishment! So, what my ? is, is how can I still see him, but my parents know about it but won't get mad at me? and how can I get there trust back?
20090226105721AAeAnly	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How does this work?!?!?!?	So i've gotten in trouble alot for seeing this guy that my parents know nothing about. he kissed me and it was my first kiss, and he knew that. but what can I do so I can still see him, but my parents won't get mad at me for doing it, but we can still have privacy? {btw I can't be outta there sight anymore, so being alone with him is out of the ?}
20090226111317AAeOXEf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why he broke things off out of nowhere?	I met this guy and we had an instant, undeniable attraction and connection.  We talked about everything, made each other laugh, enjoyed the same things, and the sexual passion was through the roof.  He invited me to go out of the country with him, took me to his office to introduce me to his employees, introduced to me to all of his closest friends, and we spent just about everyday with each other.  The best part was we still continued our own lives, he tended to his company and I tended to my schooling and career and we never lost touch with our friends.  Then all of a sudden I come back after being out of town for a weekend and he instantly changes his tune.  Instead of being super affectionate like always was he was distant and things were different.  Finally he tells me the truth(so he says).  He felt like he was in a relationship all of a sudden and that things were moving too fast.  Now let me add this, I never was "that girl" that pushed herself on someone or asked annoying questions like "where's this going?"  I was always super laid back and never invited myself over or out with his friends.  I basically went with the flow of whatever energy he was throwing at me.  After going back and forth for a month with him telling me we'd get together and talk about what happened and him telling me   he missed me and wanting to see me again, all of a sudden I never heard from him.  Now almost 2 mths later I'm still hurting and I miss him so much and I really felt like he was the one.  The worst part is I STILL don't know exactly what happened and it bothers me so much.  I can't stop thinking about him and I don't know what I should do at this point.  I know I should get over him but how?

20090226101152AABnSyc	Family & Relationships;Friends	How will you deal with this?	You have a roommate who talks about nothing but herself, either directly or indirectly..

20090226161623AAhssEB	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I Wrong To Be Mad?	On Sunday my boyfriend left for the army, it was the last time I was going to see him for 7 months and I was really heartbroken.  My best friend and I had plans later that day, but I just felt so low, and I didn't want to bring her down as well, that I sent her a text at 4pm, as soon as I got home telling her I really didn't feel up to it, and I was sorry.       The next day, I text her and suggest we should hang out soon because I felt really bad for not hanging out with her.  She sent me a text saying "YEAH, LIKE YESTERDAY", and I tried to explain to her I was feeling REALLY down because my bf was leaving, and she didn't seem to understand.  In response, that night, I saw a blog she posted:      "So whatever she blows me off I get it, but its understandable for me to be upset for awhile. And she text me today when im working all like we should hang out soon and I said "yeah, like yesterday." so we get into this fight and ****, and shes being a ***** all "Boo Hoo me" "My boyfriends leaving" YEAH ***** I GET IT! But you dont have to treat your "Best friend" like dirt. Because I blew a lot of people off yesterday my mom my friend Angie"      My boyfriend, while he still had his phone, then received a text message from HER boyfriend calling me a suicidal case whale (none of which are true) and started attacking my boyfriends son, who is two years old. My boyfriend then retorted by telling him something my friend had told him while she was drunk (but she forgot and thought I told him) so she spilled all my secrets and then threatened me.  When I confronted her that I did not say anything she said she was sorry and I didn't hear from her the next day.       Then on Wednesday I recieved a text from her bragging about going to Tan-Tar-A, and how her boyfriend was taking her there.  Only two weeks a go my boyfriend had also spoiled me on a trip to Indianapolis, where he ended up proposing. I am beginning to think she was jealous or something, because she keeps texting me none stop, like nothing happened, bragging about being at this spa.         I'm not upset that she's having a good time, I'm upset because I felt she blew the whole situation out if proportion and now she's just acting like nothing happened when she said so many horrible things a bout me.

20090226112137AAerYl8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend broke up with me for his ex-girlfriend?	My boyfriend and I had been dating for almost a year. For two weeks all of a sudden he started being distant and unaffectionate. Then he broke up with me one night saying he wasnt ready for a relationship because he has too much stress and cant give me what I need. I found out from his friend later that he had broken up with me cuz he thought he had feelings for his ex still. A few days later my ex and I met up and talked, he never admitted why he really broke up with me, but we got back together cuz he said it was too hard without me. How do I know that hes really over her now?

20090226104204AAvS8XI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy like me? How can you tell if someone fancies you?	Theres this guy that i dont know that well, but i kind of like him. I know that he recently liked this other girl but i am not sure he does anymore. He's farily new in the school so i havent had much of a chance to get to know him, but hes friends with my friends and the other day in the library he came and sat opposite me in the library during our free period and we talked a little bit and joked around. And sumtyms i think i see him looking at me out of the cornor of my eye and he looks up and catches my eye when i walk in a room. But that might be just a reflex when someone new walks in. If that makes sense. I am just curious as to whether theres a possibility he might like me aswell.

20090226105117AA4XuA3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I ask him out or is he just not interested?	It's a long complicated kind of thing so every person's views and advice are very welcome: I started out hating him because of what he did to my best friend *Amy the past year.He's the built-up immature pretty boy stereotype but he's never failed to somehow getting girls to grope him.I warned her of his exterior but she kept fighting the urge to go out with him even though he was just using her like he uses all other helpless girls that fall into his trap.There's no question about it,*Jay is good looking but I've learned my lesson and have surpassed just looking at one's outward appearance.I knew it only took time for him to start checking out other girls;and that’s exactly what he did.*Amy was depressed and heartbroken but I figured she’d get over him through time and she eventually moved on.Now, it’s 09, a new year and lots of things have changed. Including my perspective towards him... I can’t stop thinking about that captivating jerk.It didn’t simultaneously happen out of thin air; it started when*Amy darted towards me one day stating that her and*Jay chatted at a b-ball game when he surprisingly stated he thought I was “kind of hot”.I wasn’t sure how to take it at the moment.I urged her that she misheard.He's not my type at all.But now, I’m head over heels.I started linking pieces together and it turns out he may have been dropping clues that I’ve ignored out of spite.I avoid him now, hiding my feelings because I don’t want to hurt *Amy; but more so I believe I don’t want to get hurt myself.      I’ve never felt anything like this before- it could just be because I’ve ignored most men’s flattering appeal to me but now I’m ready for a change.  What should I do? He barely pays attention to me anymore. Have I completely ruined the chances of there ever being anything between us?        *Note all names have been changed due to privacy issues

He likes to be "in control" with EVERYTHING. so yeah and he always puts me down. and today he called me a pushover because i would tell this person to stop telling my parents about me and him when they are like 50 years old and i'm not going to yell at an elder. you know? and he said that i let people control me and i need to stop because he wants a girl that will stand up for herself. or hes going to break up with me. and he says that he's only being hard on me because he loves me.
20090226100039AA4DBK1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Now that Bisexualistm or Bicuriosity is on the rise, Do you think In Near future Women Dating will be common?	And i dont mean Women dating with the purpose of becoming GFs  . I mean, even Straight women, just dating to know eachother and have fun but call it a date and have kissing if want to.. But then they would not consider themselves lesbian.      I think this will start happening as more and more Women start having more Freedom.      And would any Straight women here, would you not do it? I mean, just a date.. you dont have to marry the Woman. just have a nice time together.       I dont know, but i feel many straight girls think other women are cute..and just like poking a babies cheeks with your finger.. wouldn't you want to just kiss or touch a girls face because she's cute.. Not even romantic love but just because she's pretty.

20090226113256AAwNmSE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it possible for a person to have an effect on another person without that person being aware?	In my situation, I'm sure I'm having an effect on a guy and he doesn't even realize it. I notice him picking up my mannerisms and doing and saying things that I've done or said recently that normally he would never say or do. If I turn my head or make a certain face and we're standing in a group of people talking he'll end up a split second later doing the same thing. Or when we talked about a bar/ restaurant we attended with friends the other day I describe it to him as an intimate place as it was smaller from other places we all had went and he laughed at me because of how proper I speak and how he didn't understand. Then two days later I heard him describe the spot in a similar fashion. We have two very distinct signatures when we sign forms, he signs by drawing a picture and I sign by just putting my 3 initials, after he saw that one day he started signing his name by his 3 initials as well. All of this is really cute but I'm just wondering if I'm truly having an effect on him and he just doesn't know it, if I'm looking at this too much, or what?      **If it helps, a month ago I did tell him that i was attracted to him but he said that he didn't really see a future with us so we agreed to just be friends but every one in a while we may flirt with one another ( he's a big flirt). The thing is I enjoy being his friend but I still really like him and knowing that I'm having an effect on him is frustrating, and I'm wondering if I'm very slowly starting to attract him.
20090226114109AA6yUOb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend a loser?	Right now I have been dating my boyfriend for about 9 months. He is 28 years old. Right before the start of the year he got laid off from his job. Since then he has only has one screening interview and no real interviews for a job. I don't think he is trying. He tells me about all of his Xbox gaming adventures. I guess he plays Xbox until 3 or 5 am some nights. I don't think he is REALLY trying to find a new job.,. instead he is living off of unemployment. Because of this, he has moved in with his sister and her boyfriend. She is letting him stay there for a few hundred dollars a month. I feel like she is enabling him to sit on his *** for even longer. What do I do? I have tried to hint to him that he should be practicing different programming languages that will help him find more jobs in his field.. But his response is " I do java script" I don't really know how to motivate him.. I feel like hes going to still be without a job for many more months.. maybe even through the summer. I'm a very motivated full time college student with a small business on the side.. I don't understand how he can just sit around and do nothing all of this time.       I would like to point out that this isnt about how much money he has, I just feel like I am the man in this relationship and it is starting to bug me to the point where I'm not even sure if I'm attracted to him anymore. He's starting to come off to me as a weak, helpless individual.. and I don't think I like that. What can I do? Should I break it off and move on? I barely have time to see him as it is right now because of my busy schedule.. I'm torn.

20090226164103AAktoHR	Family & Relationships;Family	How to deal with separation anxiety?	I'm 2hrs from my god-mother, well she's not really my god-mother, she's the first mother figure that i have ever had. When I first moved to where I am now, I didn't have a mother figure in my life until I got introduced to her at church by my cousin and this was 9 years ago. Ever since I met her, she has played the role of a mother to me and my best friend b/c both of us were a motherless child. My god-mother and I don't get to see each other very often, its like 5 times a year or maybe less than that, idk and we don't talk that much over the phone either. Even though she has two young children of her own she treats ALL of us the same and love us the same. She is more of a mother to me than my own mother is. Don't get me wrong I love them both the same. I'm trying to get out of this separation anxiety but is having a little trouble.

My family removed all of the mirrors from her house, because whenever she looked in them, she said "Who is that?"  Everyone treats her like she's young and beautiful, and if she asks how old she is, they say "20."  I am SO angry at this, and want to break the news to the old hag.  How can I do this?  I REALLY hate the whole situation.

20090226105847AAfbrnD	Family & Relationships;Friends	I think I am depressed, what should I do?	My father died the day after my birthday in November. A couple of weeks ago my best friend has started ignoring me. I feel like he has died too. The person I'm in a 9 year relationship with is like being with a brick wall. We have not had sex for the majority of the 9 years we have been together. I am unemployed and spend most of my time with my dog and cat. I've been thinking about ending my life lately because I feel no hope that it will change. After I finish writing this I am going to Google-"what is the easiest way to end your life". I've traveled a lot and am usually a happy, positive person. Lately, I feel like a needy emotional mess that no one wants to deal with. Then why should I exist if I benefit no one?

Not because I couldn't but since I'd never see her in the halls since our classes are different.      Anyway, a few nights ago, I was helping her with some math work, I had to explain a question. This was an assignment for marks, and her partner and her did nothing. Before she logged on, she has trouble concentrating, and she said she will use her "magic" to focus.      The next day, her partner and her quickly begged me for my work, and, because the girl I like asked me politely, I gave her it, and she copied most of it down. Right when the bell went, and I took it back, she got most of it down, but then before she left said, "see   I used my magic to finish" :D.      Do you feel, I was used?       I feel like I was, being the nice guy I am. Now, I feel very angry for what has happened.

20090226135239AASXyfb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I wake him or let him sleep?	Ok, well, my fiance, Patrick, shattered his kneecap not too long ago... He's had a hard time getting around... I (or one of his friends) have to drive him everywhere, and he needs help standing up almost every time, and putting his leg up when he's sitting down, and just getting around in general. I feel so bad for him, because I know guys like to "take care of themselves" and everything... But he really can't right now... He tried that at first and ended up hurting himself more... Today I brought him to the doctor to have his knee checked and everything, and they numbed his leg to do some work on it. Now, he's at home with me and he fell asleep on the couch. He's hardly slept since he hurt himself, because it really hurts him at night and in the morning. I would let him sleep, but he was supposed to take meds for his knee now, and I made him lunch, because they said for him to take it with food. I don't want him to miss out on time that he could sleep, though... I feel so bad for him... What should I do? Wake him? Let him sleep? He needs the meds for his knee though... what should I do?

Bad =   - Not alot of my friends like him   - He goes to the other school in my area, so we wont see much of each other except for when me meet up      - Usually, we're out for a day, something stupid like that, then he dumps me., but eventually we go out again. and i dont want that to happen again, because ive seriously had enough of it, but it has improved we've been out for about 5 days, so thats an improvment, and we're planning more time to be with each other.       There are other small factors, but i just cant remember them right now.       Finally, please ive your advice about what to do. im so confused, because it seems that its changed, but im scared that the situation hasnt :(      Please explain, instead of saying dump him, or something.       thanks loads!

20090226124002AAGEOpH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help me out please, full credit to best answer!!!?	Should I take my friendship to the next level?   Does my friend of 8 years like me as something more?   I was over at her house the other evening helping her with Pharmacology and she was wearing pajama pants and a tank top type shirt, looking beautiful, and playing love songs on the computer. We have known each other for 8 or 9 years, but she always has viewed me as part of her family like a brother, and I feel the same way like she is my sister, and she has said in the past she wants an older man and views me as a good friend. We are in our 20's, but I haven't had much experience with relationships, and it's hard to understand women sometimes. I don't know if she just wanted to be comfortable while studying, or was trying to turn me on or something. She did have a guys myspace page up for some of the time while we were studying, but it seemed as if she were giving me signs. She still lives with her parents while finishing up school, so I didn't want to do anything stupid. She took a break from studying to go take a shower, and she said do you want to come with me, but joking around. I would have said yes, but her parents were in the other room. But that evening just changed my mood and changed the way I feel about her.

20090226123644AAppVPB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Jealous of bf ex gf, what was that about?	Okay, I am sooo over it now. But when i first started dating my bf last year, i was a lil jealous of his ex. More reason becasue how she had him wrapped around her finger. Reason being, he was a good guy who did alot for her, and she played him shady by cheating and lying to him. At first i though that would make him not trust me by luckily he does not have trust issues b/c he is mature. Anyways i was jealous becasue she played like she was an angel and hurt him, to where i though he would treat next gf like crap, but i am so happy he treats me very well. I love him. But has anyone ever experienced that where ur like is she or he gonna treat me bad cause they were screwed over? Now she realizes he was a good guy and she is miserable with another mans baby who doesent care about her, and a new bf who doesent do half the stuff my bf would have done for her if she was true. But i just want to know has anyone else had that feeling before? Thanks

20090226133153AAIHjgd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So confused.  I could use some help from adults?	I am 30 years old and I have a male friend who's 40.  We met off the internet with the intent on seeing what happens. We've hung out a couple times and most recently, had sex. It wasn't even very good. We had a few drinks and it was mediocre at best.  We've considered ourselves to be friends since we met. Well, we talk all day long through the phone. We probably call eachother a good 10 times lol.  and we talk about absolutely nothing on top of it.  Well, he had just called me after he had his haircut.  He told me that he was telling the girl who does his hair about me.  He said that she asked him if he's been seeing anyone and he told her how sweet I am and how kind I am. He told her that he's never met anyone like me.  Also, he's the type of guy that most would consider hard and mean, but with me, he's a sweety.  Maybe he just considers me as a friend.  Maybe a little sister.  Would it ruin the friendship if I told him how I feel? Maybe I should just see what happens.

20090226122111AAQoYtu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I get a womans point of view?	She is a family friend and I've known her for years. I was good friends with her brothers but lately I've re-connected with them, and gotten closer to her. When I saw her 2 years ago I sent her mail which she replied, and asked me to write back, which I didn't I was busy at the time.      Then 3 months ago I went to visit her again we went out a few times and she had a good time, picked flowers and gave them to me. She tells in the past she'd cry because she was so lonely and had no one and last in her family to get married. We went to her place so I can fix her computers and she put on soothing music and dimmed the lights but I didn't make my moves. I think I respect her brother too much. I live pretty far away for work. I decided to send her roses and mail to tell her why I didn't write back before cos I was busy, and that I want to keep seeing her but she tell me she has a boyfriend who has been divorced and has kids so she can't tell her parents yet. She then tells me if there is anything she can do for me to ask, and ends mail in see you next time. Since she says she has a bf, and I have met him I'd like to forget about her but I've known her so long and I love her - why didn't she mention this when we went out? I can't focus on work because I always think of her,

20090226122638AAX1xj2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a turn off for girls?	A couple years ago I liked this girl thats my friend. Were not best friends. But every  now and then she wants to go out with just me. She said she liked me then, but saw me as someone she would settle down, and wasnt ready to settle down yet. Weve been talking alot lately. She said her friends took her to see a movie, but she made them choose another because she knew I wanted to see it. We went to see it and out to eat, and she said the ticket was going in a scrapbook. But I hate playing games. Would it be ok to send her a msg saying, "Hey, what would you say if I said I still like you as more than a friend?" or something like that? Is that wrong?

20090226135451AAKH2do	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I Being the Doormat in this relationship?	My bf is off balance right now & I can tell he's cheating. He hangs out with his friends alot. I don't get to see his friends and whenever he hangs out with them he never ask me if I want to go. On Valentine's Day after he got off work he went and hung out with his friends until 3 in the morning.      I know he's cheating I can feel it in my gut, just Monday night he went out and I called his phone several times and he didn't answer. Then when he called me back he said what do you want. I started yelling at him and said where you at and he hung up the phone on me and when I called him back he didn't answer.      We barely have sex anymore, if I try to have sex with him he doesn't get aroused and turns his back and says that he's tired. I can tell he's annoyed with me because he says so. He says I call him too much when I'm out and I act crazy and clingy. He said that I don't treat him right but it's mostly because I don't trust him. I just have this uncontrollable feeling in my gut that tells me so.       He's hardly ever home when I'm there. When I'm not home he's relaxed and there. When I'm there it's almost as if he's in a hurry to leave and go somewhere else. We hardly ever do anything together except watch TV. I say something about it all the time, he says I'm nagging. I can tell he's unhappy with me but I don't know what to do to change it. He smokes alot, drinks alot and is gone sometimes till all hours of the morning.      Am I being the doormat in this relationship or what should I do. We don't talk like we use to and he said he doesn't want to go to a doctor to find out what's wrong with him

Hey girls, Im 18 in college and I need a girls perspective, I had a girlfriend for like a year and a half and we had sex very often and then when we broke up i had sex with a 20 year old girl maybe like 8 times or something, and recently I've noticed this girl in my french class who seems like a real sweetheart, but I'm pretty sure she might be a virgin. I don't really know if she'll be turned away by my past. She's really cool and we're starting to talk a lot during classes, what would you girls think? would you want to date a virgin guy if you were a virgin 18 yr old girl? I wouldn't even mind waiting a while before having sex. she has something more than just the physical aspect to her.

But yesterday on Aim we were just talking and she had to do an essay and I offered to help so I did a bit, then in class I said hey whats up and she replied, then I asked did you finish the essay and she gave me that smurk/smile girls do and said no in that weird ways girls do. And just a couple sentences more we talked. But I always find that she is looking my way I sit right next to her but it seems as if she is looking out the door as if she heard something I dont know..       Does she like me? And I find I always have to start the convos on aim, is she shy or what? Im confused         The few things iv said to her in person I felt PERFECT.. Like some other girls i talk to I tend to blush and what not..      And What do I talk about, Hellp! I have no idea what to say! I really like her! I dont want to mess it up!      Today I was in class and she kept looking at me, I could see her looking at me at the corner of my eye and when I go to look at her she turns her head.. She did it all day today in both class's         And Since I sit literally right next to her and the door is all the way on the other side (to the right) I dont know.. and in my other class i sit diagnoally behind her.. She like turns her body my way and looks and then I see her in the corner of my eye and then she turns away   32 minutes ago - 4 days

20090226120057AAOqZjv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you ever had an orgasm from eating food?	I used to cook in a restaurant. There was this young incredibly hot girl that worked in the front that ordered food from my station. I put in the extra time and effort to make it perfect for her.      When she came back she looked like she just had an orgasm. She had this blank stare on her face and her eyes were glazed over like she was in another world. She said "Oh my god! That was so good! I couldn't stop eating it." And she kept thanking me profusely for like 15 minutes straight.      Needless to say I had a huge smile on my face the rest of the night. And that's one of the reasons I still love to cook. =)
20090226135718AAWRBqZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(Girls) How would you react to this?	I am a junior is high school and there is this girl I like who is also a junior. When I was a sophomore, I talked to her in class and I kinda gave her the impression that I liked her. Now as a junior I don't have any classes with her but when I see her in the halls we both say hi to each other. I want to find some way of asking for her number so I could talk to her more.       I rarely get to talk to her and I see her talking to other guys sometimes(just friendly, I think and hope).      I was thinking that next time I got to talk to her in private or something I could say either:    "I haven't got to talk to you a lot anymore, we need to catch up, can I have you number" or    ( I knows she plays tennis and I also just started to play tennis)   "Wanna play tennis some time, can I have you number"      Girls, it that too creepy that I am asking for her number like that?      Do you have any other suggestions on how to get her number because I don't have any classes with her?       Thanks, 10 points to best answer.
20090226131934AAXGgqc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are guys such...? please help 10 pts best answer?	Ok so I went out with this guy for 2.5 years maybe a little more toward the begining of the month me and him broke up.It was over something stupid. So since we broke up he decided to go and get another girlfriend.[whore and im not just calling her a whore because i dont like her its because she really is a whore; she goes around hooking up with many different guys]. But anyway his locker and my locker are pretty close to each other and every time me and him are by our lockers and he is with his GF he shoves her in my face and starts kissing her or whatever. But yet he tells me "oh i want to get back together with you and stuff" but he acts like a total A**hole when hes with his girlfriend. Before we started dating we were really good friends. So he knows what pisses me off and stuff. I still care about him a lot. But I don't know what to do. This is seriously killing me ; im crying all the time and i don't want to do anything. im usually always hanging out with people and having a good time. But now im a mess; i don't do anything and i don't know what to do with myself. =/      Oh yeah, and I'm in high school and I'm 16 and he is 18.   sorry I know its pretty long : )   *********   and today; he comes and tells me " Im sorry, for everything... i broke up with Liana (his gf), i didnt mean to hurt you;; i miss you;; i dont know what to do without myself blah blah blah". Basically he wanted to go or hang out or whatever tonight night, so should I go or not, I dont really

20090226134558AAnjDd3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a guy with a gf keep looking at another girl?	Okay so there is this guy that goes to my school. He definitely has a girlfriend but for some reason I get the feeling that he's looking at me--actually I know that he's looking at me. When it first started I thought that I was just over my head, cause I mean why would a guy with a gf always look at the same girl? So I thought that maybe he wasn't looking at me.      But he does it a lot. And to no one else but me. So what's up??   He stares too...
20090226123833AAhDcNW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dilemma! Involved with a new boyfriend but finding it hard to let go of ex...?	I was with my previous boyfriend for a year and 10 1/2 months.   I broke up with my boyfriend around christmas and have just started to see this a new guy around the beginning of February.    This new boyfriend is great, he's funny, very smart, witty, and we get along great. He's told me he can speak to me in a way he's never been able to speak to anyone else before. He told me the other day - "When I'm talking to other people I'm just on auto-pilot, with you I actually feel like we are having a proper conversation, and I want to pay attention and respond because it's intriguing and challenging."   He is not particularly emotional in public, but is not afraid to give me hugs etc.   I've already met his parents (Mum and Step-dad had me over for dinner and got on fabulously well).   All in all, he's a great guy and treats me really well.      The EX-   I broke up with my ex because he was beginning to drink heavily, hang around with his friends too much (I don't usually have a problem with it but they act like idiots most of the time) and has been out of college for over 6 months and barely looked for a job.    However, the (almost) two years i spent with him were fantastic and I loved him dearly.      My problem is - -       Now I'm with this new guy, but he is busy a lot of the time so I don't get to see him as much as I'd like. Mainly in college for an hour or so but we are surrounded by friends so it's hard to be intimate and chat. He is busy on average 3 nights a week and is now doing a course which takes away his weekends.   I have been chatting to my ex a lot more and he keeps telling me he loves me and on occasion we have met up and talked, maybe hugged (NOTHING MORE) and now I am so confused, I don't know what to do.      Could somebody please help me make sense of everything. My feelings for my new boyfriend are clashing with the feelings of the ex, and because my new BF is always busy, I have more time to think of the ex.   When I'm with the ex, I always think of my new bf, however when I'm with my new bf I don't think I ever think of the ex.      What does everybody think? Could I just be missing what I USED to have with the ex because I don't spend enough time with the new bf or what?   Any opinions and suggestions would help me so much, because this is driving me around the bend!!      (Sorry for such a long post, wanted to give the fuller picture)
20090226122145AAVFdKE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this is turning into something serious?	I have been dating my boyfriend for a little over one month now. He has told me that he loves me and has talked about wanting to settle down with me in the future. He has already met my grandparents and wants me to go meet his family. When he came to my house to visit my grandparents, my grandma told me later that she has a feeling that he and I will get married one day. She said that that when he sat next to me, he sat in a way that looked like he was protecting me. When we're out in public, he isn't afraid to hold me, hug me, hold my hand, etc. I feel very safe with him. Since we first started dating, he has given up drinking (I never ever drink) and he won't look at or talk about other women in my presence. Does it sound like we have a long future together?
20090226132632AA3RAIn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I get involved? Should I tell  my cheating ex's gf that he's  trying to get me back?	My ex cheated on me almost 2 years ago. Every couple of months he sends me a random e-mail. It turns into a 20 email conversation expressing our feelings (i admit I still care for him, but Im engaged and pregnant with a guy I love very much more). I always end up telling him to leave me alone since it complicates things and I do not think I can trust him. But a couple months down the road I receive another email...He has been with the same girl he cheated on me with. Telling me he's miserable and misses me and wants me back. He is AGAIN being a sleeze ball in my eyes (he's been with this girl almost 2 yrs now!!) So I wanna know should I show her these emails and let her know his motives? I vowed to never get involved but I would probably appreciate a forwarn if i was in her shoes. Also, will she believe me or think Im trying to break them up to get him back maybe?

I have had many flirts and I have kissed a guy but it has never developed to anything. I'm also a virgin. I feel really bad about it. I'm not interested in any guy in my school how do I get a boyfriend and look for one?
20090226122132AADPODy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, could I have a minute of your time?	Well here is my predicament, I am in love with this girl, I mean crazily in love. I am a stand-up guy, never had an argument with her, constantly treating her with the respect and attention she deserves. When we were together, I would wake-up extra early to run and do chores for her before she woke up. Tried to make everything perfect without her having to ask. Well, out of the blue, she tells me she doesn't feel comfortable and decided it wont work between us. That our personalities don't click. So, here I am, 6 days later, sent her a text and told her that I respect that she made that decision and that she'll need her space, and that I will always be here. Things were fantastic between us, we are both catholic and never got physical because that's for marriage, but we just felt the same about everything. I guess that being old-fashioned is not what women want these days, but my question to you all, what would make her change her mind all of a sudden and should I ever expect her to return that message? It's been nearly a week and I just feel horrible, I am trying to get over her, but I am too stubborn to think that it'll just end like that. If there are any details that you feel necessary to know, email me so we can talk out of the confines of yahoo answers.

20090226121821AAf25ih	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do?????????????????	now this is sorta relating 2 one of ma other questions but anyway   there is this guy( we will call him T ) that i really like and i think he likes me but i don't know for sure. well the story behind it is. last yr he asked me for mi mobile number in the january but i never gave it 2 him so he was going on @ me 4 at least 2 months trying 2 get ma number then 1 day @ lunch me nd ma m8 were in the playground he asked me 4 it again but i didn't give it 2 him mi m8 did so that night he txt me but we only sent a few texts 2 each other cause i would ave saw him the next day @ school. well T had been acting all werid eva since he got ma number he started whispering 2 ma m8 which im guessing was about me because next thing u know he has came up behind he and slapped mi a*** then we all started joking again.  the next day we were up in the playground cause it had been reli sunny and T and mi m8 were whispering again so i shouted over to them "what are u 2 whispering about" but they never replied so i walked in front of them going towards class and next thing i know what T had his arms around mi waist hugging me. so i just thought ok just a friendly hug nothing wrong with that is there. but ever since that day he kept on doing more werid things. by now i had finished school because i had finished mi GCSEs but he was just about to end 3rd year as i was finished mi 5th and final year. now both of us didnt hear from each other the whole summer because we were both busy. thenn i saw him again in september whenever i was waiting on mi bus 2 college and he was waiting for the school bus. we had kept in contact now because i saw him 4 afternoons a week so we got to catch up on a load of things. things started to get werid again cause he started to slap mi a** again do werid things. then the week before halloween we were txting each other 1 sunday night just out of the blue cause i just sent "hey wuu2?" nd he just replied "watching tv u?" so we had started a decent conversation and we were both watching the same film that was on which was dirty dancing.  then he sent me a txt saying"come over to mi house 2mora" but i sent back "i cant ive got an evening class 2mora which isnt over til 7 what about tuesday afternoon" so u can sorta guess what his reply would ave been "rite tuesday it is" so we just started talking bout a load of things.  now he had been trying to get me over to his house since the june before but i couldnt go over cause i had to help mi mum and i usually had the dog out a walk whenever he would have asked me to come over. i had finished mi evening class on the monday nite @ 7 whenever he sent me a txt saying "ur coming to mi house 2mora" so i sent "y did u think i was gonna cancel lol" he repiled " nah i just cant wait lol :P" so we were having another conversation that night and again we were both watching the same dvd Saw 3. within 2 nights we had sent each other 64 texts :O.  finally the day came and i was going over to his house so i went over at around 4.15pm after he finished skl and i finished college. now i was txting mi mum in the hall whenever he said "hurry up and move" so all i could do was laugh and look at him but before he gave me chance to move he lifted me up as if he was carrying me over the threshold but i put mi whole weight down so he fell and i just landed on ma feet but of course he got hold of me again this time he was able to hold me up even whenever i put mi full weight on him so he threw me on his bed and again he fell on the ground so all i could do was laugh. he went and sat on the computer chair and i sat on the bed so we just talked for a while and then he said something very quietly but i pretended not 2 hear him so he had to say it again and it was "can i kiss u" but i never gave him an answer so he came over to me just leaned forwards towards me and started 2 kiss me so i started to kiss him back. now im not going to go into 2 much detail but i will just say we were kissing for a long time but nothing else happened. so whenever i looked at the time i said i had to go but he didint want me to go and u could just c it in his eyes that he didnt want me to go but my dinner was ready. so finally after 5 mins of trying 2 persuade him to let me go he finally did. now we didnt txt each other that night because i had 2 go somewhere and i could take mi mobile :( . i saw him a couple of days later but we never mentioned it to any of our m8s which was good because they would go on and on about it for ages. now we were going out unoffically for a couple of weeks but then a few things had happened within my family so i decided to call it off and we both agreed to that because of family problems but he was always there for me as a mate. so then on news year eve we were txting each other just asking each other what were we doing 2 celebrate the new in and both of us said having a drink cause our parents allow us 2 have a couple. he kept asking me on news years eve could he come round to mine

20090226121519AAptcF1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boys are so confusing please help!?	So, I went to public school and left because I was in the popular group and the girls were getting into bad things, no one knew that was why I left though. When I came back to public school, the popular girls (my old friends) didn't like me but they weren't mean to my face. The popular boys on the other hand keep saying in a kinda joking way "I want you", and they'll call out my name randomly and when i turn to look at them, they'll laugh. Now I think they're making fun of me, but I'm pretty and they don't do this to anyone else and they're like obsessed with me in a bad way!

20090226125003AAfSKXD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a really weak gag reflex and its soooo embarrassing....?	I am thirteen and I have a terrible gag reflex. I gag whenever I see things like ketchup and stuff, and I gag whenever anything crunches in my food that's not normally crunchy or whenever I taste anything weird. And I mean really gagging. I've actually thrown up at school on a few occasions, and It's really embarrassing. My friends actually put ketchup in one of my sandwiches and I threw up all over. (I got them back, lol). How can I supress this gag reflex?
20090226125306AA4HwxK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I be friends with a girl I love, even if she is in a relationship?	Ok, I have a problem.      I know that when people read the question I think they are going to think I am crazy but let me explain what's going on.      Me and this girl are staying in the same country for 3 months, we just met when we arrived here and it's been 1 month since we met.      Her boyfriend is in her home country and they have been together for 3 months.      I meet this girl everyday and I think this is the most wonderful girl I have ever met.      The first few times we met, I just thought she was a really nice girl and was just happy to be her friend. But now I am starting to have these feelings for her and I feel really bad inside.      Her boyfriend has been here to visit for the past two weeks and I think he is an ok guy but I meet her everyday and she shares everything with me, and she is always telling me they are having arguments and we actually party together and I don’t think he treats her to nicely and he definitely doesn’t fit her personality.      But every time we go out and have some drinks, she keeps telling me how nice I am and is touching me and hugging me and kissing me on the cheek for example.      Before, I just thought that was because she was drunk and didn’t really think about it, but last weekend she actually took me aside and kissed me, we were both drunk but she told me she had to do that.      And for the last few days after the weekend we have both been acting like nothing happened but we meet each other every day and talk like friends so we are not avoiding each other.      So my question is: Am I reading too much into this, should I just act like nothing happened and can we be friends or should I avoid her. Keep in mind that I have to meet here every day at work, but she leaves in 6 weeks.      I know that she has a boyfriend and all so I am not hitting on her or anything but I would still rather just have her as a friend than not have her in my life at all.

20090226133327AAr5YSO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My teacher hit on me?	The other day, we were playing basketball in PE, and I got knocked over and sprained my ankle.  It hurt really bad, and my PE teacher had to carry me into his office to wrap it.  While we were in there, he kept asking me if I was okay and was being really nice about it.  When he had finished wrapping my ankle, I slid off the table but he had to help balance me.  He caught me, but he had put one of his hands on my boob.  I blushed and he smiled and told me how pretty I was.  He kept his hand there and asked me if I had a boyfriend.  I told him no, and he started to slide his hand up under my shirt.  He started to kiss me, and at first I really liked it because I thought he was so cute.  Then he pushed my bra up and started to play with me.  I started to cry and told him no, and he stopped.  He told me he thought I had wanted to do it with him. He said we could do more, that he could teach me how to do things boys would like and that it would be our secret.  I’m 16, and he’s only like 32.  I don’t know what to do.  I don’t want to get him in trouble, because I do think he's cute, and I did kind of like it.  I’m embarrassed to tell my parents or friends.  What should I do?
20090226133221AAHovwb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you read a girl to know if she likes you?	In PE class we were jogging around the gym and this girl and her friends were behind me and one of them said 'lets go around hes too slow' and she said 'are you kidding im following this'. What does that mean? Does that mean she wants to be around me or something and likes me because i like her and i dont know if i should talk to her or if she meant something else and shed not talk to me. Ive never had a gf and not experienced in reading girls even though everyone in school is starting to. How can i tell what she is thinking?
20090226124136AACbIS9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i let him know i love him?	okay, well, i'm only 12, and the guy i like is 13. This is not teeny love, i swear i luv him, i'm crazy about him, and i want to be with him. So, we are in completly differant social groups, i mean he's that jerky popular kid, and i'm that little emo girl. So i need tips on, well, everything from talking to him, not being to obvious, to flirting.
20090226123648AAVjQK0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need a womans' insight to understand this woman. PLEASE HELP!!!!?	Ok here's the situation:       Me and this girl work kinda together. same job, but different shifts; though we still see a lot of eachother. She isn't even a year into her marriage and has one son about to turn 1. I, on the other hand, am single with no kids. lol Anyways, her husbands located quite a distance away and the 2 are only able to see eachother maybe once every 3 months. Well we start talking and hanging out, seemed like a great start to a good friendship. Then one day she says something like, "If I weren't married, we'd be doing it and then we'd probably get married when we got back." I kinda scoffed it off as a joke. Maybe a week later she asks the "what do you think of me?" question.... now seriously, we all know what that question means. So now I'm curious but not fully sure if she's really got a thing for me. Couple days later I figured I would kinda test the waters.... well this ended up in passionate kissing and her inviting me to stay the night. (she initiated the kissing btw) So I spend the night, we do the deed, and hang out for the day in bed just cuddling. I go to work and come back and spend the night again, this time we just cuddle and go to sleep. Next day comes and she starts giving me the cold shoulder. So I'm like, "great, here we go with some BS." I give her her space and later send an email to her. She replies with the whole "big mistake, didn't mean to mislead you, lets just go back to the way things were before" deal. I'm like, fine. not like I was expecting to run away with you anyways. lol But I still I valued our friendship and had THOUGHT that it could've survived after the affair was over. But now, she acts as if I don't exist anymore. she laughs and talks fine with everyone else, but she won't even go as far as look in my direction. She won't answer the door if she knows its me on the other side either.      So basically... WHAT'S GOING ON IN HER HEAD????       Does she resent me that much? Does she hate me and wish I would disappear? Does she have deeper feelings for me but can't admit to them due to her marriage and child? Will things ever return to how they were before we had sex?      Should I confront her about it? Should I send her a calm e-mail asking whats on her mind and why she resents me so? Or should I let her ignore me and wait for the day that she starts talking to me again?      I really want things to get better between her and I, so I don't want to do something that will only make matters worse.

20090226124724AA6q7SC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I a horrible person?	I really liked this guy (we'll call him Jim) last year and at the beginning of this year, and at first I thought he liked me back but then he started totally ignoring me, so I kind of gave up.  When it was becoming apparent he didn't like me, a boy from another school (let's call him Dave) started texting me.  Dave and I text each other every night for like four hours, and he told me he liked me, but I've only met him once so even though there might be potential, it's not like I really LOVE him or anything.        Now this is where it gets confusing.  My friends all knew that I liked Jim at the beginning of the year, but now they all know that I have been texting Dave and they are encouraging the relationship with Dave.  However, in a case of perfectly horrible timing, Jim has started talking to and flirting with me again.  I still have pretty strong feelings for Jim, but the other day my friend Marissa asked me if I still liked him, and I said no because she told me she likes him and I don't want to seem like a b*tch, trying to steal away my friend's crush when she thinks that I like Dave.  I don't know what to do.  Am I a horrible person for still flirting with Jim and wanting him to like me?

20090226125855AA33v8o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for guys...why do you not like just one girl and have a backup in case chatting up doesn't go well!?	I've known this happen a few times, when guys really like a girl and want to chat them up but then have this other girl as a 'plan b' chat up in case he doesnt manage to chat up the first girl or it doesnt go successfully. So do you prefer the first girl or like them equally? Do you guys never just like the one person? And why is it sometimes the girls aren't physically alike in any way like one has blonde hair the other dark, one short, one tall? As a girl, I would love to understand you better so sorry for the questions; i think girls generally tend to be interested in the one guy! Thanks...

20090226131256AAOdUAu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he ignoring me for no reason?	I met this guy homecoming at our school and we exchanged numbers and he made the promise to call. Well when he never did I didn't think much of it because I didn't relly care. I still said hey to him when i saw him, but it was no big deal. Later on in the year we went both went to a party and we talked the whole night and everything was fine. We talked all week and everything was great. Then one day he asked me if i liked his friend and I said no. I was confused at the question, but he said he was just asking. Later I met up with someone for lunch and it turns out he knew the guy so, later he asked me if i liked THAT guy. I said no and asked why. and his reply was "cause i won't go behind him"...I was at a loss for words, I just said ok and went about my business. But then the following days I noticed he was ignoring me, like i didn't even exist. I never tried to beg for his attention i just let it continue. Then the following weekend approached and he called me to come hang out with him. I didn't go because I was out of town, but as soon as the week started again he started ignoring me again!! I don't understand why he is ignoring me, he doesn't even LOOK my way....its like i'm not even there...
20090226131512AAkpqXj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you ask him too?	I met a guy through a friend at a frat party. We danced and ended up making out. I'm a virgin, so didn't sleep with him. He was cool. He emailed me the next day to see how I was. I responded and asked him the same. He responded, but didn't continue the conversation with a question, so took it as him not being interested. My friend wants me to ask him to our sorority formal b/c she thinks we would have a great time. He told her I was "a nice girl" and I told her "nice" means I didn't sleep with him. She said he is not like that. Should I ask this guy to our formal or is he just not interested?
20090226131601AAdFgMN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship advice:I feel suffocated by my boyfriend's constant presence. How do I tell him I need space?	We only started dating on Valentine's Day and we happen to work in the same office so I see him 4 out of the 5 days I work and he wants to monopolize as much time with me. I understand that I should appreciate that he wants to spend so much time with me, but it's too much.  Today I ignored one of his calls and when I called him back he told me he drove by my house but I wasn't home.  I also had an email, a voicemail, several text messages and a message on facebook from him.  He says I make him happy and I feel like he's too intense and suffocating.        How do I tell him nicely that I need my space, every time I run it by my friends they say I sound mean.  I do like him, I like being with him, but not all the time.  I don't feel ready for a relationship but committed because he seemed upset that I hadn't said "I'm your girlfriend and we're exclusive."  I was exclusive to him, I just didn't think we needed the titles and now everything is too much.  Advice anyone?

20090226132437AAufoFe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help me, I got into a fight with my boyfriend over his ex?	I'm in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend. Everything is great because we manage to see each other every weekend. The only bad thing is that he works with his ex at a tv station (the one he dumped for cheating on him). At first it bothered me, but I trust him. We were joking around and making fun of his ex's voice so I asked him what attracted him to her if she had such an annoying voice and he straight up told me : "well she's hot". He then stressed that just because she was his ex didn't mean he couldn't say she was hot. This bothers me. Am I wrong to feel irritated at this? He's been texting me since last night to apologize, but I'm very mad. What should I do? He does work with her everyday after all.
