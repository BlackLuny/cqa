20081021145842AAxbc2U	Dining Out;United States;New York City	What restaurant in New York City would be the best for a first date?	Okay, so I'm taking the guy I really like out on a first date this Sunday. I want to request you guys to tell me what restaurant is the best for a first date in New York City? I'm vegetarian by the way, but he's not.       I saw this really awesome restaurant in Manhattan, I forgot where it is located, but if I knew, it would be my first choice! It was a beautiful restaurant with open rooftop (I think) and had a lot of leaves on the top. I think they also had a water fountain. It was very breath-taking! By any chance do you know what restaurant I'm taking about? There aren't many restaurants like that in Manhattan, I know that for sure!      Please tell me your suggestions. Thanks a lot everyone!

20090304215118AAeaLwh	Dining Out;United States;Honolulu	What is the best Luau in  Kauai?	My fiance and I will be going to Kauai for our honeymoon and I've been reviewing all their Luaus but I can NOT make up my mind. We are staying at the Hyatt for four days but I heard their luau wasn't that good for the expensive price and then we are staying at the hilton by the airport. Can anyone suggest a luau that is really entertaining, exciting, and really a lot of fun? I heard of the gaylord's too...are they good? Please someone point me in the right direction. We can't go to the Sheraton's one because we will be at the hilton by then and don't really want to drive back in that direction and they only do their show on Fridays....help?
