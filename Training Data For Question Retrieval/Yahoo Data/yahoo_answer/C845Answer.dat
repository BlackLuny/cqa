So an individual is basically happy with his/her job. He/she has found it rewarding and is motivated to continue on. This in turn for a business would be beneficial as they would have happy employees thus better work production and so on.    Hope this clarifies.

I recommend Cart-Ops.com for creation and SEO.    2) You can setup a free store on ez33.com (way better than eBay) they give you $3.33 for signing up and it's $3.33 a year for a store.

eAIbzzYAaa	Absolutely. Whenever you add your social security number to an account, your credit report will be impacted; its sort of like co-signing on a loan. Im guessing that youre young and might not have a lot of credit experience under your belt, so this is a great way to get a head start on building your credit history and is actually something I would recommend for anyone that hasnt had a credit card before.    Your credit score is determined by the following information:    ? 35% - Payment history  ? 30% - Total amount owed vs. total credit available  ? 15% - Length of credit history  ? 10% - New credit accounts  ? 10% - Types of credit used    As you can see, most of these wont apply to you since you cannot open your own accounts. You can take advantage of the payment history category (comprising 35% of your score) and the length of credit history (15% of your total) by being added to your mothers account, which will prime you for your own credit card in the future at a much lower interest rate than someone with no history of any kind.    Another important thing to mention is the fact that American Express has a number of programs for people who are on joint credit accounts (usually parent & child) that can assist you in getting your own American Express card when you come of age or are ready to apply. Many of my clients choose to go this route when they go to college or when they have built up their credit score to a desired level; the majority of these people say they would recommend this to anyone who hasnt ever had their own credit card before.    American Express customer service can be reached at 1-800-528-4800.|`|d1c771fc8a224373e7eaa3944c7f6d44aa	Yes it can.  Whenever you add new credit (mortgage, car loan, student loans, credit cards) your credit will initially go lower.  After 6 months of proving to the credit bureaus that you can handle the new credit, your credit score will gradually increase.      Remember, it is important to maintain the amount you borrow on the card below 40% of the maximum limit.  If it is higher, it can hurt your credit.|`|AA11234615	No, because she remains the actual card holder responsible for debt incurred.|`|YPkTsrssaa	Yes,because my wife add me for her 2nd credit card and it show on my credit report in good standing
d6af4dee21e9e8e07e83b0cea89ddfbeaa	According to the Internal Revenue Code, you cannot use an IRA as collateral.  You can take a loan against your 401(k), but  if you could borrow your social security and risk losing it would you do that?  Unless this loan is going to make you a lot of money, I would strongly consider another option.  Typically you can lose your everything but your retirement and house in bankruptcy.  Now you want to sacrifice something that is protected!!!

You may be able to (it depends on the bank), but, depending on your credit score/history, you may be able to qualify for an unsecured loan for a decent rate online.    Also, see if you qualify to join a credit union (http://www.cuna.org offers a way to see where you qualify) because they have MUCH better interest rates as a whole.|`|ab6c137a2865f6a61d2c2280e5b8959caa	You can certainly borrow against your 401(k) if that's the type of retirement you have.

ZA8jGhtQaa	Interesting question.    Drawings are not always required.  In design patents, they are always  required.      In US utility patents drawings are required only if necessary to understand the invention.  Since the standard is subjective, it is good practice to always include at least one drawing in a patent application.  This avoids the possibility of rejection for lack of a drawing.  Since the rejection slows down the application process and carries an expense for response, avoiding such a simple rejection makes sense.    Hope this helps.  My email address is public.  -Steve

5hh6sVg5aa	Many times these two are interlaced or combined (I used Merriam Webster).    Policy refers to a plan or a course of action in accordance with a decision, in essence a rule to be followed. A company's policy can be that the President and Vice President cannot be in the same room during board meetings.    Process or Procedure refers to the steps done to perform a policy or action, a traditional method to getting things accomplisged.  The company's policy to never have the President and Vice President in the same room is followed by this process - during board meetings, the Vice President is at another company location and video conferences in to the meeting or voting is done by proxy (someone comes in to represent/ cast the VP' s vote).|`|AZ622Mggaa	The policy refers to the guidelines or rules around doing something.

oN7FMpY5aa	You can refinance out of any program at anytime, assuming there is no prepayment penalty attached to the loan.  Now, I believe that VA and FHA loans alike do not carry pre-payment penalties, but double check your current loan docs to be sure.    visit http://mortgagecounselor.blogspot.com or my website http://www.johnleblanconline.com for more info on this type of topic.    Best of luck.  If you have any questions, feel free to email me.|`|AA10074148	You may refinance out of your VA loan at anytime that you want. There is no time limit. There are normally no pre-payment penalties attached to VA loans, so that should not be a problem.    All you have to do is find a mortgage broker allow him to complete a mortgage loan application, run a credit check, supply him with the necessary documents, and pay for an appraisal.    Once that is done a loan program will be discussed along with the interest rate you can get based on your credit score, after which loan docs will be drawn and your VA loan will be paid off.    I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.    "FIGHT ON"|`|lE1rPThkaa	I can get you refinanced! Shoot me an email to msmith@premierloangroup.com, and let's chat!

Personally I think the best job in the world is the one in which you are your own boss (i.e. self employed). I have been self employed my entire adult life and wouldn't trade it for working for anyone. However, there are prices to pay for being self employed and it requires not only a certain level of skill in some area, but also certain temperment to deal with being responsible for generating your own work.

f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	Canceling a phone contract will not effect your credit unless you do not fulfill the terms of the agrement.  If you cancel early there is usually a stiff penalty for this, I have seen them up to $175 with some companies.    Paying your insurance on time will not help your credit.  But if you don't pay you will get cancelled and getting other insurance will be tougher.  Staying with the same insurance company does not matter to the other companies.  They want your business and don't care if you have been with another insurance company for 1 or 10 years.  Now a lot of insurance companies will try to reward loyalty with discounts to keep you.    All companies report your credit limit.   The thing with Capital One is that they used to(not sure if they still do) report your high balance as your Credit Limit.  So even if you had a $5000 credit limit but only went as high as $2000 they would report your CL as $2000 and not the $5000.  This really causes problems when the scores are trying to figure out your credit utilization.    To improve your credit the best thing to do is to pay all your cards/loans on time every time.  If you have any credit cards keep the balances under 30% of the limits.|`|AA10554698	Phone contract will not effect credit score.    Paying Insurance will not effect credit score.    Having the same Insurance company will have no effect to the next one.    I don't think any credit cards show your "credit limit" on your credit report.  They ALL show current outstanding balance and/or your highest outstanding balance.|`|NgDeiuJRaa	Cancelling your phone contract will not effect your credit unless you don't pay the bill.    Paying your insurance on time will not effect your credit as it is not something that is reported on your credit report. It will however help you out if you are looking to renew with that insurance company.    Staying with the same insurance company is only beneficial to you when you renew with the same company. Insurance companies just want your business, they don't care about loyalty to a competitor.    Capital One does report the high limit on your card, so no worries there.    If you are looking to improve your credit use your credit cards, make regular monthly on time payments, and then pay them off. Reuse them if you like.    Also secured loans and car loans are excellent ways of improving your credit. But you must be on time with your payments every month.    Hope that helped.|`|35f5a298a3b38c410ad01e492036c508aa	Canceling your phone contract will only result in a small penalty fee.    The insurance company can't affect your credit unless you owe them money. They'll likely cut off your coverage before reporting you to the credit bureau. they also could care less about loyalty. If you change insurance companies the new company will only wonder why you left the old one.    A credit card is the easiest way to build credit. Don't use the card to by things that you can't afford to pay cash for. Only use the card to pay monthly bills,  for gas, or anything you can afford to pay off right away.

If you pay the price they should give it to you. If they still won't or can't, there may be some legitimate reason. Review your report (or ask someone to help you understand how), and check for discrepancies. Make sure your personal information is recorded correctly (b-day, ss ), that your account numbers are accurate, and that any late payments, closed accts, open accts are all as they should be. You will likely discover the source of the problem by doing this. If there are things that need correcting, contact the bureau(s) and they will investigate.

My lender said he's seen people's score be apart by 100 points with the same info on all 3 reports.|`|AA10906058	Put the numbers ascending, and take the middle one.    if your scores are 680 710 720, your mid-fico is 710|`|AA10057151	Take the middle score. Do not average. You may have a 720, 718, and 595 and your middle score would be 718. This worked in my favor when I applied for a mortgage refinance two years ago. My scores were 687, 683, and 596. My rate was based on the 683. With credit scores differing by so much I wonder how/why the mortgage lenders all settled on the middle scores. It seems like they would try to screw everyone over and use the lowest score. Good Luck

If it wasn't made part of your contract, then yes you have to close, but don't count on the repairs getting made after you close b/c it's not going to happen.

If you didn't do that, then it's a verbal and verbal contracts in real estate are NOT binding.|`|2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa	Demand that an amount of money equal to the cost of the needed work be put into escrow.  You still go ahead with the closing, because what you're closing on is the deal with the bank as well as with the seller, and in this credit market, you do not want to delay things and give the bank an excuse to change the terms. The seller doesn't see that escrow money until the work is completed to your satisfaction.  Any good lawyer would have suggested this to you.|`|yGOabB61aa	Did you sign anything? If not, ask to see the property again, get a different lawyer, then negotiate things you want/need.    If its already been signed you're pretty much in for the ride of your life.

Product Volumes (Historical or Projected) either are acceptable it depends on the speed at which your business changes.  Historical for businesses that don't change.  Projected for fast paced change.  Material-Bill of material cost for the product of invoiced price which changes every year.  Labor- Direct labor which hopefully is part of your bill process  Overhead-The fun part.  Take your overhead cost and seperate them into cost pools like(Management, Freight, Materials)  Cost Drivers-For example weight may be a good driver for freight and materials but not necessarily relevant to management.  Headcount could be a better driver for management.  The trick is it's subjective to you and your managers.  Then take your cost driver and spread it as a percentage to different product family with the best method then spread your cost across your product.    Then you have material, labor, and overhead combined for total product cost.    This is  the full absorption method which means it can be used for financial reporting.       
2e7edc32a8153e41fff68023c059d81baa	Yes, they are great
kiiFoaPdaa	Yes. When you're refinancing or consolidating, you have to think of it as taking out a brand new loan in order to pay off the old ones. So, the old loan that you're paying off had to have interest paid on it up to the day you pay, and the new one starts right away.     Rule of thumb for interest: if you're not paying it off, it's compounding one way or another. "interest on interest" is the way of the world, because if you don't pay it then you owe the creditor something for the use of additional money.|`|AA10260180	Yes, darling you can pay interest on interest ie student loans it depends on the contract agreement.

OacSIfSiaa	Sounds like a classic case of identity theft.  If you did not recieve a card, then someone found the application and changed the billing address and opened the account.    Contact the credit card company and notify  them of the situation.  If you get no result from them then you should contact the following to file a complaint.  Report the credit card issuer to the Comptroller of the Currency.  Phone number is 202-874-4700.    Report the company to your state's attorney general's office. You can find links to your state's AG website at naag.org.  Your state might allow you to file a complaint online.  This is probably the most effective complaint to make as it is the attorney general's who have filed most of the lawsuits against credit card companies.  For example, it was the California AG who sued Providian and forced them to pay the largest judgment against a credit card company ever.    Report the company to the Better Business Bureau. Submit your case for dispute resolution online at www.bbb.org.    Next,  place a fraud alert on your credit reports to protect you from any further problems, here are the contact numbers  Equifax-800-685-1111  www.equifax.com     Experian-888-EXPERIAN (888-397-3742)  www.experian.com     TransUnion-800-916-8800  www.transunion.com     Next, go to the following  web sites to find out how to resolve this problem. here is their link  http://www.consumer.gov/sentinel/  CONSUMER FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFTS.  http://www.ftc.gov/credit  FTC WEB SITE    Hope this answers your question|`|KIh1xUjeaa	Sounds like somebody stole your identity. call household asap. and cancel all cards or applications that come into them in your name.|`|r4W6uiUbaa	call whatever company that was and tell them the situation. for the future..don't even return emails like that even when you say cancel...that probably was set up by a computer system taking any return email & assuming you wanted it. it is a most definite scam..good luck|`|FFNuKo3haa	Hey, just for future reference, when you get those credit card offers in the mail, there is a 1-800   on the back for CREDIT OPT OUT.  You call it enter in your social and your information and they remove you from their database for all credit agencies so you won't get those anymore.  I did that and I haven't recieved anything in the mail.  I highly reccommend that.    Second, about this company, you need to call them and tell them that you did not authorize any charges.  Ask them for proof or ask them what was charged.    And if they fail to take those charges off, you can file a discrepency.  Tell them that if this is not resolved you will file this as fraud with the district attorney of your area as well as contact the 3 credit agencies (experien, transunion...) that will scare them.   This happened to my friend in the past and I helped him report it and it was resolved though it took my time up.  Just also document who you talk to on the phone and get their names, the date and time you talked to them just in case.    Good luck!  Hope this helps.    PS:  Run a credit report and see what is on your credit history just in case someone else got your info.  You can get 1 free credit report each year without points being deducted.|`|VJkUhHaQaa	You have been a victim of identity theft.Call householdbank asap and explain to them everything that happened from a to z. Then they will investigate to find out exactly what happened. So you will not be penalized and make sure the account is closed!!!

And if you have any open credit card accounts and they mail you those credit checks, shred them to, to avoid any other hassles.  Good luck|`|F2JEvYX7aa	call the credit card company, let them know that you don't have a card and never used this card. It is fraud. The phone number will be on the statement that you got.

The check will be a fake, but you will not find that out until you have already shipped the item and paid the shipper.  Then you will be out of a dollhouse and whatever money he sends for the "shipper".    Also, look at the language he uses.  "Hope to read from you immediately you received this email." and  "that has already being in transit"    This is not from a native English speaker.  The email was probably sent from another country.    I would tell this man that someone else has already picked up the item and it is no longer availible.  Then block communication from him.|`|htMOl3c4aa	Well, John Terry sounds like such a unreal name that someone would just pick.

Basically, he is saying he will send you more $ and to take what you need.  It could be legit but it's risky doing business the way you are doing it so, good luck.    I wouldn't do it because if he is in Florida, he can get it cheaper.  I would respond by making that point.  |`|hyxru8Tpaa	its a scam|`|iXt3erseaa	Sounds completely fake. Wait for a real buyer.

AA11525891	The stock market no longer affects us as it did back in the Thirties. What will affect you is the current credit crisis which to you and me means a shortage of credit.

caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	It is very likely if your shortfall is due entirely to your income that you will face a penalty.  Your husband in particular may want to have additional monies withheld from his salary even though you are both at 0.  I withhold at single, 0 and have an extra $20 withheld from each pay because I work a part-time job on top of my regular job and it often happens that the PT job doesn't withhold enough.  Combined I don't make anywhere near what you husband does so $20 wouldn't do much for you, but it makes an example.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	There are 3 safe harbors for not paying enough in via either withholding or estimated taxes:    1.  Taxes owed less than $1000 (missed).  2.  Taxes owed are less than 10% of 2008 tax liability.  3.  Taxes paid in are 110% of last years tax liability.    Even if you miss this, the penalty is roughly 4% or $400 on $10,000....that is, if you pay by 4/15.      You can reduce the penalty by getting the money in NOW, even if you file later.  Your 4th quarter payment is only 16 days late.  if you had an unusual spike in income later in the year, the form 2210 can also help.|`|mI4lrKdHaa	There are precedents here. And presidents. If you owe tax money and should pay a penalty, when you get caught by a committee looking into your worthiness for a cabinet position in the US, you will pay. Just say you are sorry and hey, no problem.

xxq5JAM6aa	The latest stimulus money should be distributed to all who file an income tax. Be about $8000/payer. Collectively, they would do a much better job of spending it than the government. About half would be saved, which would prop up the banks. The rest would be spent within a year, propping up the retail economy.    'Course all this spending of borrowed money will be for naught. The 'experts' don't really have a clue as to what to do. This 'crisis' will will eventually resolve itself, just take longer with this relatively puny intervention.|`|AA11284831	While it sounds tempting, it would do little to stimulate the economy.  Most folks are hunkering down against the economic storm and would simply hang on to any extra $$$ that that would put into their pockets.  Either that or pay down existing debt.  Neither of those actions would do a thing to help the economy as a whole.    The wheels of the economy are greased by consumer spending.  When people are out of work or are afraid of losing their jobs they stop spending on anything other than essentials.  I'm out of work right now and my discretionary spending has crashed by over $2,000 per month.  On top of that I'm buying one tank of gas every 3 weeks or so instead of 3 or 4 per week and am not eating lunch at restaurants or having a few cold ones after work with coworkers.  That's another $1,500 a month pulled from the economy.    Government spending on public works projects is an excellent way of pushing the economy back onto the rails.  Sure, it costs a lot, but there are significant knock-on benefits as well as it puts folks back to work and generates taxable income.  Both of these will help restart the economy in the long term.  It also improves the infrastructure which has been decaying at an alarming rate for a couple of decades now.  The bridge collapse in MN a couple of years ago was directly related to decaying infrastructure and the ONLY way to cure that is to start spending on infrastructure repairs, upgrades, improvements, and replacements.|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	The US federal income from taxation (including social security) is 3 trillion-ish.  So half of that is 1.5 trillion, which is about as much as bailout + the proposed stimulus combined.    I don't really think a tax-free holiday is any better because it would greatly favor the rich.  They've already seen their tax burden decrease drastically over the past 8 years, and it's that transfer of wealth from the middle-class house-poor to the uber-rich that is a rather large factor for the collapse we're seeing.  Trickle down economics is a farce.  We need jobs an infrastructure.
NSKimt1Qaa	Some of the big-time officials are getting caught, but you're right, a lot aren't.  I'm not sure why some of them seem to have an invisible barrier around them keeping them safe from the IRS.  Our tax accountant made a minor mistake on our taxes a few years ago, back when we actually HAD some money.  It cost us $400.  I think the government spent more than that in all their time and paperwork.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	They are politicians and everything they do is okay.  The IRS doesn't have a strong enough commissioner to make waves.  The idiot even showed up with Rep Rangel, a big tax cheat himself,  promoting efile for taxpayers.  Big Joke|`|DAMZKbpDaa	How do you know the IRS wasn't all over them, too?    But I am rather disappointed with Obama's choices, too.

Also you might want to buy 3-5 things on Ebay before you actually put something up for sale.The buyers want to now that your active and are not going to scam them    Use good keywords in your auction title.     Dont lie be honest. If something that you are selling has something wrong with it or has been unboxed, Tell them, You will get bad reviews and no one will want to buy from you anymore.

Figure out a really good name for your ebay store's account something that has to do with what your selling.  Make sure the item's are in really good shape.  Give a description of the item and if anything is wrong with it or any damages (it will come back) with bad reviews.  Do not except checks, or money orders.  I only excepted Pay Pal.  Take really good pictures the more picture's of the item the better change you have selling it.  I haven't made enough lately to pay my account, don't go backwards get out first. You can get caught up in it and before you know it there billing you for a large amount|`|c25xSVutaa	I sell alot on Ebay. I try not to ship overseas cause I get screwed on the shipping most of the time. Also make sure you pack really good, like if you are selling dishes pack em good. Make sure you do some research on your product to see what it goes for and what other people are selling it for. Don't over charge on shipping, but be careful not to under charge either. I usually charge 5 bucks shipping unless its something really big.  Be descriptive, don't lie and take good pictures. You don't need alot of pictures one or two good ones will do.  Oh and answer your emails promptly, in case someone has a questions before they bid.  Hope this was helpful! good luck selling

70c07dc4ea7277562affa6e49eb90d6caa	If its not in writing you are not obligated to accept any "gift." Its really wrong for them to even suggest that you are obligated when in fact you are not. I see that in alot of business dealings.

Set up automatic biweekly or monthly deposits from your regular checking account - have it transfer just the amount you want to spend when you go out. Then, only use that card when you go out. Be careful, though - you don't want to overdraft on that account and get charged fees. Make sure you are always aware of how much you've spent and how much you have left on this allowance.    Bonus: Read the book "Your Money or Your Life" - it'll change how you look at things!|`|GIXwJWfvaa	i know how you feel, dont worry. many people  have this problem!! once i get money, i feel the  need to just spend it! the easiest solution to this  may be opening a bank account. or having a  responsible family member hang onto it and only  have them give it to you when needed! good luck!|`|uHuU2j5Waa	First learn how to spell responsible and then go from there
AnptZGTtaa	I am sure that you have been looking at other homes in the area in your search for the perfect home for you. So I would suggest you think about all the upgrades the other homes had to offer and come up with a price from that perspective.   Maybe the seller has a recent appraisal available for you if so that will give you the best idea of what the house is worth. Never mind all the upgrades the seller's agent keeps mentioning. They made the upgrades to suit them, not you.  Ultimately it is up to you what you feel the house is worth to you and what you should offer the seller. The appraisal mandated by your lender will make sure that you are not over paying for the property, since they will only loan you what the appraised value of the property is. Just make sure that your offer is contingent on the appraised value equaling or exceeding the sales price.|`|aAOgJvjSaa	You should be able to find the homes that sold in the last month or two in your zip code. See what they sold for and compare that with the house you are looking at. You should be able to figure out a fair price to offer. Either way just don't let the fact that you like the house get you into a mortgage that you cannot afford. Stick with what you can afford as well as what is a fair offer. The worst that happens is they say no to your offer and you look some more.|`|2yl8omcAaa	Ute b says it all :)      1st thing to do is to look around on that neighborhood and compare the prices.

3vHGjuBgaa	The first date the WMR site gives you is a general refund date showing you that they are processing your return and when you should expect it. It is a very GENERAL date. Then, the week of your actual auto deposit, the IRS (usually on Wed) will update the WMR site again and will give you the exact date that they are doing a DD of your tax refund.    My WMR page originally gave a general date of Feb 3rd, then changed to Jan 30th for a DD date on the Wed before when I checked.    So, I would NOT expect it the 3rd, but I would expect it Feb 6th because the IRS does do DD on Fridays. And, according to the IRS chart you should have a DD on Feb 6th since your return was accepted on 1/22!  http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p2043.pdf|`|l0rKjtUDaa	Don't count on it.  i have called the IRS five times and have gotten 5 different answers.  the website still says mine will be here on the 3rd but according to IRS agent  5, it hasn't even been processed yet.

0yqQg9CXaa	Call Charles Schwab the moment you get laid off.  They will do all the paperwork for you.  What you will be doing is transferring your money into a Rollover IRA.  It won't cost you a penny or any fees.    Do not let it sit in your old company.  And do not transfer it to your new company.  Schwab treats even the $100 investor with respect.  I am sure the will respect you quite a bit.  I want you to buy some 3 year cd's with that money.  The market is going to be topsy turvy for a while and at your age, you need to preserve your capital.  No fees for buying cd's.

Take a few days and review what has occurred within the last year of your mutual fund.  Sadly, the majority of Mutual funds have all stumbled in a spiral downward, the market will only cause this condition to worsen.  However, these funds will stabilize at a point of which is undetermined.    Remember, you could always get back into the MM when and if they appear to rise...    Far too many believed in the 401K to the extent that they would be millionaires when retirement was on the horizon.  I am a somewhat negative thinker concerning the 401K, I feel when this market opened to the general public it was just a trap used to gain the middle class coin.  Over 20 years have passed since i recalled the latter and i must admit i was correct for once.    All of my friends have lost practically everything in their 401K.

U7nj9Kg4aa	It will take months to realize the effects of the bailout.  The 'bailout' was only approved and the bailout was a 'line of credit' to be used to help financial institutions, it wasn't created to directly give money immediately to specific institutions.  It will take time to access things and figure out who gets what.  It was passed quickly to give people a little confidence in the markets and a little confidence that they are working to restore things a little.  The US economy is like a huge boulder...when it's rolling along smoothly it's tough to stop, but if it slows down or does stop, it's going to take a lot of people pushing and force to get it rolling again.  It can't just go from 0-1000 mph with the stroke of a pen.    People are still panicking and it's people that are panicking an selling becuase thier stock haven't skyrocketed that are causing the markets to go even lower.  Uninformed investors are saying "holy crap, the sky is falling, I better sell!"  Informed investors are saying "holy crap, look how cheap those stocks are, I can get some deals!  I better buy!"  The uninformed sell their stocks, the informed know it's a panicked sell and make a low offer to buy and the uninformed say "Holy!  It's worse than I thought!  I better sell everything!"  And the informed scoop up all the stocks cheap and will be laughing all the way to the bank in a few years.  The Great Depression caused a lot of people to be broke, but did you know that more millionaires were created in the USA during the Great Depression than any other time period in history?    Unless, you absolutely need to withdraw your investments immediately, leave them in where they are (as long as it's a decent company) and buy more if you can (just be cautious of what your buying becuase some companies will fail during these rough times gauranteed).  The only time you are losing money is if you withdraw it and the markets are down.  If the money is just sitting in an account/stock, you haven't lost anything....it's still there, just might not be worth as much at the moment.|`|AA10633259	People are still afraid of a major crash and are pulling their personal money out of the market which makes it continue to fall. The money will also take a while to show a positive effect. |`|kr6W1Bb6aa	To answer your question a little less rudely the bailout will take months to years to really take any effect. A possibility of the markets keep falling is people want to save what money they have no, as of now nobody knows where this money will go so nobody wants to take a risk of the bailout not helping their company. The dow will continue to drop until we get real answers, until then a lot of people will continue to take money out and sell their stocks.|`|FrZ2c3vmaa	The stocks are still dropping for several reasons.  One, although $700 billion seems like a lot of money, the losses incurred by bad lending practices are far greater, and it will take months for that bailout money to hit the companies that need it.  Two, the problem was too much borrowing, so the government's solution is to make it easier to borrow money.  Third, people are a little gunshy so they are selling when maybe they shouldn't be.  And lastly, the market fluctuates for strange reasons sometimes.    http://www.jobsnmoney.com|`|0JL3Mg78aa	There is still too much volatility in the markets.

The total assets are in the trillions, so the bailout will only solve a few problems, and it all hasn't been injected into the markets yet.  |`|AA11421582	You really expected to see results THAT fast?

E9yH3tWMaa	I believe that these profits and a great portion of the banks' reserves were represented by assets that were either imprudently valued in their accounts or suffered material diminution during the credit crunch.    The obscene bonuses paid to bank employees encouraged ever more complicated derivatives to be created so that paper profits could be earned to boost executive and traders' incomes. These products became so complicated that even with the combined expertise of an accountant, economist and actuary realistic valuations would have been difficult. These products were traded by ill informed individuals whose business relied on nobody saying that the King had no clothes.    When confidence was lost, banks found their assets over valued and potential liabilities that were never expected to crystallise in a rising market suddenly wiped out banks' assets.    A government not bought and paid for by International Financiers would have let the ailing banks fail and used the bail out fund to make good any shortfalls in deposits. Instead, the reckless bankers who caused the problems continue to draw their salaries at public expense while the threat of hyper inflation hangs over the heads of savers and pensioners.|`|JusfPCQgaa	It was paid out to shareholders in dividends.    The rest was reinvested.  Short sellers speculated that the stocks were over-valued and bet they would fall.    This prompted revaluation of the stock price and the short sellers cashed in.    Short sellers can be individuals or global companies.    Money never gets lost, it gets transferred.
ZzQiPJPFaa	I don't think that personal income tax cuts are the start to creating stimulus in the Australian economy. The government should be looking at ways to reduce financial burdens on employers first, not only to protect jobs, but enhance employment.  The first thing I believe should happen is to ABOLISH Payroll Tax. Why should employers be taxed for employing people ??  Secondly, remove ALL TAX on petrol & diesel other than GST. No TAX on production costs, but only one Tax, payable at the point of sale- the petrol bowser.  Cheaper fuel would reduce the cost of virtually everything, from a loaf of bread to travelling to work.  Everyone would benefit, employers, employees,self employed, unemployed AND pensioners.|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	Lower income tax isn't going to be much help to Australia's growing number of unemployed.|`|NM1L4B0Vaa	I think tax cuts should be part of a stimulus package as they have a longer-term effect than one-off handouts.    Tax cuts will give most people more money in their pockets, especially if they are made retrospective to start at the beginning of the year.      While the Rudd Government made many people happy with their previous payout, it is unlikely that the last $10 billion handout was responsible for propping up the economy, leading to two points:    1. Any payour effect is short-lived and requires more handouts.  If they give out $42 billion now, there is no more money to give and Australians end up paying for it in the long-term.    2. The last handouts were around the same time that there were drastic decreases in petrol prices and home loan rates - this gave Australians the money in the hand that was spent pre-Christmas.    Tax cuts will give us the money the following year as well because the Government would be very unlikely to raise taxes the second year when it is getting close to an election.  So, instead of getting a $300-$950 payment in one year, I would prefer a $1500+ increase on my tax return 2 years running (at least).|`|Z1DGTvunaa	The government should change the taxes on particular items, not give tax cuts or issue "one off" payments. My husband and I both work full time on average approx. 100 hours per week. Because we both work and put in the time, we are penalised by paying higher taxes and receive absolutely no family allowance or any other allowances. Where does the money that pays benefits to the unemployed, pensioners, unmarried mothers etc. come from? Hard working people like us. The money that was issued to some people depending on their income before Christmas would already have been spent. Has it helped stimulate the economy, I don't believe so.    I believe Mark's suggestions are realistic as they benefit everybody.|`|5akAfzB3aa	No, I don't think so. It suits the low income families better than the wealthy ones who can afford it and stay afloat easier than the poorer citizens who can barely afford to survive as it is.     I think It will help stimulate the economy on the short term as long as all the other aspects of the plan work and have enough consistency for the results to show themselves in a significant manner.|`|29IiPpTFaa	Tax cuts tend to help the higher income earners and the lower income earners... it is the middle income earners that tend to do it quite tough in economic times because they don't get the government benefits the lower income earners get.  Not that lower income earners don't do it tough either... I am not sure handouts will help either.  It is a short term effect.  For a month or two while the money is there fresh, it will boost, but the economy issues will be around a lot longer.  Money needs to be invested in employment opportunites...     One question that I have never seen raised... is why is the corporate tax rate not lifted.  Companies seem to be the ones that control the economy... their profits are the most important thing and if it looks like the profit is less than expected... lets sack a bunch of people.  Maybe there should be more regulation on companies and how they do business... impossible that less than a year of an economic crisis has caused companies as large as BHP to suffer??|`|dnoykOX8aa	It more about if your paying less tax you have a bit more cash in hand to pay your bills, that make life a bit easer and we all fell a bit better and not all stressing out about it all

There is a spot on the forms where you have to say that your parents are claiming you as a dependent.

ImU2a9Braa	Not all appraisers enjoy this kind of challenge and those that do and are competent at it will charge significantly more for the appraisal.  This will be an appraisal of a complex property type due to the inefficient market.  It will require significantly more time to do research, evaluate market data, investigate comparable sales, and document.    If there are truly no recent market sales in the nearby area, the appraiser will need to do a detailed cost approach on the property to set an upper bound to the value range.  This will require establishing an accurate value for the land.  The cost approach will probably need to be given more consideration than it would in appraisals of properties with abundant comparable sales.    If sufficient data exist to produce reliable trend information, the appraiser can consider, at least for one comparable sale, a property that sold outside of the normal time range (generally six months or a year).    The appraiser should have done an analysis of prior sales in the market area, even if they were one to three years old, and compared them to very similar properties in the wider area that sold during the same time frame.  With sufficient data, the approximate contributory value of the subject's location (lakefront) can be established.  With this information, a nearby recent sale of an otherwise very similar property not on a lake can be adjusted and used as a comparable sale.  A statement documenting the analysis performed for this type of adjustment, which can be large, should be in the appraisal.    Similarly sited properties not on the same lake(s) but preferably in the same county, can also be evaluated for use as comparable sales. The appraiser can even go farther afield, although it might be necessary for him/her to associate with another appraiser to evaluate data from outside his/her normal area of practice.    The appraiser should also look at non-market (FSBOs, etc.) sales.  Properly identified and evaluated to the extent possible, a non-market sale can be used.  Unless foreclosed properties are fairly common in your market area, they probably should not be used.    The key to getting appraisals of complex properties past underwriting is documentation.  Every bit of the thought process and analysis needs to be logically presented, supported, and in the appraisal.     Some appraisers, either through significant experience, additional training, or both, are better qualified to do appraisals of difficult properties.  As described, this property is outside the qualifications of a state licensed appraiser.  A certified residential or certified general (who routinely does residential work) appraiser with experience in difficult property types should be engaged by your lender.    Good luck.|`|4MypYVHYaa	There are no easy answers, most appraisers base the appraisal on what has sold in the past few months. You have a unique property that might not match up with recent sales in your area.    You might try getting an appraiser that specialize in water front properties if there is one in your area. You have to call around. When you get an appraiser on the line you should 'ask their qualifications and what background they have as well as what accreditation they possess.    I hope this has been of  some use to you, good luck.    "FIGHT ON"
K7x1RHVFaa	If you are saying you aren not paying taxes, start with a 1040ES for taxes owed. Your bosses is supposed to be reporting your income and paying your social security and tax payments but if they are not do it yourself.     If they are filing your taxes for you then you should have already filled out a W4 so that you will receive a W2 for tax purposes. It is you bosses responsibility to have filled out a W2 for you or at least a 1099MISC so that you receive a 1099. Either way that is what you use to file.    As for student loans, those are not income and the interest paid on them is only itemizable if you fill out a 1040 long form and your deductions outweigh your standard deduction after allowances for AGI. If they do then fill out Scedule A&B and move on.    Good Luck.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Your boss should issue you a 1099 form.

Odds are they will tell you that you need to bring in all your docukments and set up an appointment with one of their people to fillout your taxes at that point. On the good side, if you paid taxes you probably do not owe taxes, but; they need to find out if that is for certain. Be sure to bring the bit about the loan that shows all points and interest you paid, along with all non reimbursed medical expenses, insurance premiums, tax advise fees, casualty losses, et al. You may need deductions. In the end they will figure it all out for you and if you owe they will be a small penalty, and if you do not there will be a small return. It really is not as bad as you think. Your burden is more to pay taxes than to file for them.    Good Luck.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	Just complete the form and send it in.  There will be a penalty for late filing and interest will be charged on any amount you OWED the IRS.

K7x1RHVFaa	Yes, but why?    You will lose deductions if you file separate, which means you pay more taxes.    Community property has nothing to do with her having to file, but if she does sign your joint return; it does make her liable if you file fraudulently.    If you file separately she does not have to do anything, and yo are solely liable for your return.    And there is no reason why Turbotax should not work for you simply because you are in Texas.    Good Luck.    EDIT:    I read the addition to your question and my answer is simple and direct. You report ALL your income and that is that. Go to the IRS to learn how to notate your wife on your income taxes. You do not necessarily need a Social Security number to do so. They will give you a form to fill out and she is deductible. They may even give you an SSI number because she is your wife.     As for Turbo Tax, it is not equipt for you. You will have to do your taxes in person and with the IRS. Sorry about that but your additional information explains so much.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	It's going to take a very strange tax return situation for an MFS in Texas to get you a larger refund.  Specicially you'd have to have significantly higher unreimbursed business expenses and medical bills to  see a difference.    1.  You can file MFJ or two MFS returns.  You can't file HOH.  Your wife has to file since she has to claim half your income and half of your withholding.    2.  If you itemize, so does she, evern if the amount is $0.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	"WHAT"??? i live in texas and i e-file using turbotax all the time.none of that even matters what you're asking about if your income is considered your wife's income.just file married/seperate if you say it gets you a bigger refund (i wonder how) but if you want to file married/joint you can even if she didn't have any income (i did last year w/o income)it don't matter at all who had income and who didn't,it's still both of you'll income.    usually ,married/joint gives you the bigger refund,sometimes not.|`|4mmTyMglaa	When you do MFS, you don't just split your income in half.  You would have to include your FULL income on your return.  She would not file because she would not have any income.    Since she doesn't work, it should work out better to file MFJ.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	Since Texas does not have any state income tax, I assume you are referring to your Federal Income Tax return.    Married filing separately will not give you the largest federal refund.  Where you live doesn't matter as the federal income tax is the same for all states in the Union.    Married filing jointly almost always yields the highest allowable tax refund (or the lowest amount of tax charged on your income) unless you have some very extreme circumstances.    IF you file separately, she doesn't get to file anything at all because she had no income and didn't pay into the tax system.  So there is nothing for her to get back.    You would get a refund, but your standard deduction would only be HALF what you get if filing jointly, plus you can't claim her as a dependent so you loose that deduction as well.    You need to file as married-filing jointly.    I also live in Texas and TurboTax allowed me to e-file.  I've done so for years.  TurboTax doesn't discriminate against people who live in Texas.|`|329b61f14c0d934ae2da7015180f71edaa	it should not benefit if you do it that way - because she will have to file or if she get a job later then her ssn will show up and she has never filed then the IRS will be all in your business - if you file joint she will be counted as a dependent along with your kids -|`|AA11284831	Texas is a Community Property state.  If you file separate returns you MUST each claim half of your own earnings and withholdings and half of your spouse's earnings and withholdings.  That may or may not save you any taxes compared to filing a joint return, depending upon the numbers, so you should figure both ways and go with whichever way results in the lowest total tax liability or the largest total refunds.    Examples:      You earned $50,000 and had $10,000 in Federal income tax withheld and your wife had $0 income.  If you file separate returns you each claim $25,000 of the income and $5,000 of the tax withholdings.    You earned $40,000 and had $8,000 in Federal income tax withheld.  Your wife earned $20,000 and had $2,000 in Federal income tax withheld.  If you file separate returns you each claim $30,000 of the income and $5,000 of the tax withholdings.|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	You should file joint return to get maximum benefits.  On separate return, you will not get earned income credit, which may be couple of thousand dollars.   You can file as married filing jointly (MFJ) or married filing separately. In most cases, it is better to file as MFJ.  Read  http://taxipay.blogspot.com/2008/02/fili...
Bqi7jmsPaa	No.    The son would have to live with the godfather, and the godfather would have to provide more than 1/2 the support for the child for the entire year.  He would still not be a qualifying child for any tax credits, he would only be a "dependent".    If you made any income at all in 2008, you should take the child as your dependent and get earned income credit which can increase your refund even if you don't owe any taxes on what you earned.|`|9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	He can if your son lived with him the entire year (1/1 - 12/31) and you made under $3500 for the year.

kT4I3C6caa	We are talking about one same stock here.  1 buy and 1 sale for a loss within 30 days is not a Wash Sale. However if you continue with another buy within 30 days of your last sale at a loss, then this becomes a Wash Sale.  You can claim a loss on your above transaction, and as a short term loss. But if you buy the same stock within 30 days of your last loss sale than this is a wash sale. You cannot claim loss on this transaction; some brokerage firm will even freeze your trading account for the next1-2 months.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	The wash sale rules do not apply if you do NOT continue to own the stock.    The 30 days before rule was added to close a loophole (and the wash sale rules are decades old)--this prevented sellers from buying 100 shares on Day  1, decide to sell and take a loss on Day  500 and then to avoid the wash sale rules, try to sneak in the repurchase by doing it on day  499 just before selling the first lot of stock.

KXZm6rfRaa	No, you must lose your job through no fault of your own.  Quitting your job will not qualify you for benefits.    You have to get laid off because of a downturn in business or something like that.|`|b67w0mM2aa	You are able to claim unemployment only if your employer terminates your employment (fired, laid off, cutbacks, etc). A voluntary resignation from a job does not qualify you for benefits though unemployment. If you are terminated from your job and the state determines that you acted in "misconduct" then your unemployment benefits might be denied. Typical examples of misconduct are job abandonment (not showing up to work), sleeping on the job, fighting on the job, theft, repeated deficiencies or violations of company policies. Employers pay unemployment insurance to the state in which the business operates. A business is assigned a rate each year based upon how many claims are paid out, economic times of the state, etc (kind of like car insurance - the more claims you have the Higher your rate). I would certainly advise to not quit your job until you find another one. Spend a week of vacation out in Pennsylvania, interview for some positions, see what the schools and neighborhoods are like, visit with the local chamber of commerce. In our current economic situation it would not be advisable to quit your job until you have secured new employment.

If in the end you do owe them money, come to a reasonable arrangement regarding how much each week or month you can repay.  Then ensure that you keep to your side of the bargain.    If you are unable to agree on a reasonable figure, let them sue you and allow the Court to make a judgement.

The last company I worked for used quickbooks, and while we had our main taxes handled by an accountant i had to print out the 1099s. what a mess. it printed so  many things incorrectly because idiots handled the books before me.|`|11KAjY3Paa	Well, I would certainly report it to the IRS immediately, and as long as your signature isn't on it, you will be fine, even if he forged it, there is a way to prove that.
AA10283296	If your pet is considered a "service animal" and you have a declared disability, then part of the purchase, training and care could (arguably) be deductible.    But for the average Fido or Mittens, no.    And in most cities instead of an "exemption" you actually pay a tax on them.  Just because it is called a fee, don't be fooled, it is yet another tax.    Wait until the government goes completely broke, all our things will be taxed as there won't be much "income" for any of us.|`|tw44fqCpaa	No "pets" are not deductibe in any way - the IRS requires you report the social security numbers of dependents - this is so no one writes off their pets.

U7nj9Kg4aa	ratings are tough to judge a company on alone.  Sometimes they are based on the value of assets to see how stable they are.  Sometimes they are based on market share.    Both are very stable companies and there is very little concern that either will disappear anytime soon.    go with the better deal price wise.  Just doing some quick math, I would assume the IA one would work out to be cheaper:  $120x12 months x15 years = $21,600.  The Sun Life would would be more depending how old you are right now (if you're 25 and you have to pay until age 65 it's going to cost you $28,560 [$68x12 months x35 years]by the time you are done).  Buy going with the IA one you will also free up some cashflow alot earlier and that $120 a month can then start going into retirement savings or an investment account or something.

LUoZC3ycaa	The is a big problem with duplicate content and not just copyright issues. You will need to link back to the articles and blogs the content originally came from in order to justify it legally.    The problem as far as the internet is concerned is that only 1 of the pages with the same content can show in the index and this is usually the main authority, therefore your duplicate content pages will eventually, if not already, be booted out of the index into the supplementary pile.    You are never going to create a lot of traffic with a duplicate content site.    Sorry to put a downer on it, just an honest answer.|`|AA10464818	Many people do this, unfortunately. It's an easy -- ummm, ok, lazy -- way to create content (why think and write when you can copy?)    However, two things to consider:    - your blog will not get much traffic because you have nothing unique to offer (afterall, your target users may have read the content from their original sources)    - you risk your Adsense account because the content owner may file a DMCA with both Google and Google Adsense http://www.google.com/adsense_dmca.html . If proven you copied the content without permission, Adsense can kick you out of the program|`|W8Uf5LsAaa	Now it is like, google will be seeing for the content first and also checks if has been copied from other site. Naturally the age of the blog reveals the entire thing and for obvious reasons, your blog will be de-indexed and also losses the page rank.   So why don't you start writing the blog instead of copying!!!!!|`|LHWeXLJ3aa	It is neither fair nor legal, and your pagerank will suffer greatly for doing it. So no, the internet isn't your own personal cash cow.|`|Gfj621t0aa	go ahead....  there is no harm and it is appreciable from the point of both advertiser and publisher (blog author in u r case)...    one shud not place adsense on its website if the site is an e commerce portal or any kind of business website. because ads appearing on the site may lead u r visitors to u r own competitors.....    goodluck

THqvEAIxaa	The money was never here in the first place. All the money that is 'in' banks is all electronic. Due to inflation a while ago this money has become worth less. Banks lended out the virtual money to people who couldn't pay it back and so now they can't get this money back. The amount of electronic money is at about 1800Billion but a large chunk of this has gone because of the amount they paid out and have not received back. Also a lot of the money is sitting in people's home accounts, and as they are worried about the recession, they are not spending it. So everyone in the recession country is to blame. If people started spending again then the recession might sort itself.|`|jg1pbV5Xaa	Depends on which country your asking about, laugh. Politicians get very nice wages, super good retirement packages, nothing like that unless your a CEO of a big company, we won't mention the bonus packages for either.  The bail out packages secured those, the rich take care of the rich, not the meerly common workers.      The banks have socked away what they got rather than used it for anything. No explanation. None required it seems.     Inflation problems will result from the printing of all that artificial money and you pay that price, they write it off as part of their costs expences. No problem to those with money.     The price of oil was super inflated to suck money out of us, make some rich people much richer, created lots of paper millionairs. They became a threat to the really rich people, this crash breaks most of  them. Look at the price of gas now. Remember profit is what you get 'after' expences and yet that is the excuse used to cause price increases and is now being used to cause this recession.    The money is in a few peoples pockets (like the banks). In a bit they will start making loans when they realize they can make more profit by actually loaning money again, they won't do that until the government stops giving them billions.|`|df6f139089176891ad0fbe3562d6dcc8aa	I would have thought the answer to your question was very obvious

AA10144492	You've got a couple of issues here -- let's tackle one at a time.    RE: Retail Sales of the trading cards    The best routes to take are to research the process of starting a business as well as the industry you're interested in.    I recommend checking out the SBA, Entrepreneur, The Start Up Journal & Nolo. All 4 are great informational resources for the new/small business owner. I posted links for you in the source box.    Associations may be a good avenue to explore as well. These organizations will address many of the thoughts, questions and concerns you'll inevitably have as well as many you haven't anticipated yet. See the source box for some relevant links.     Research, research, research  this cannot be stressed enough. Read as much as you can about the industry. Here are some book titles that are relevant:    * Start and Run a Profitable Retail Business by Jim Dion, Ted Topping  * Retail Business Kit for Dummies by Rick Segel   * Specialty Shop Retailing: How to Run Your Own Store Revised by Carol L. Schroeder  * So You Want To Own The Store: Secrets to Running a Successful Retail Operation by Mort Brown    There are plenty of free informational resources out there. Check the source box for links to articles.    RE: Copyright    You would apply for a copyright, not a patent, for any original designs.    Copyrights can be obtained for things of an artistic nature. This includes, of course, poetry, films, sculptures, music, fiction, etc. But can also include things that may not necessarily seem "artistic" in the general sense of the word. Copyrights can also be obtained for advertising copy, games, software programs and blueprints, to name just a few.     You can do this at the US Copyright Office  see the last 2 links in the source box. The application is fairly simple & the cost is $30 per application (it will likely rise to $45 by July 1).

AA10167681	You've definately taken a beating on this one. You should check into "Money Management" principles for your own self-assurance    You didn't say whether you bought it on the rise in March, on in the decline in May.     If you bought it on the rise in March, then you had a $0.20 profit in April, at which point you should have set a stop at your entry point.      If you bought it in the decline, and it has been going against you from day one, nobody takes more than a 20% hit right off the bat. At 10% or 20% immediate loss, then you're wrong, and you get out. You let it go against you almost twice that amount. Not good business. You are breaking every rule in the book with that huge percentage loss. Warren Buffet would castigate you.    The best time to make these decisions is before the trade is ever executed. After it's on, with money on the line, it becomes emotional, and emotional decisions are rarely on target. So when you buy, set a protective stop immediately. That is part of what is called a Trading Plan.    Your stock is acting well, and following along with the market nicely; not lagging. It popped up on the close today from $2.36 to $2.50 in the last five minutes with the highest volume of the week for any 5-min period. So there is definately still buying pressure.    You seem to have lucked out this time. I would hold it, now that the market has turned around to the upside. But I would also set a stop at $2.30, because the market is forever uncertain.    Good luck. Read a little; you'll enjoy it, instead of living off of hope and fear.|`|c2aabed26d573505ce71ae1375e57c83aa	It looks like Conexant will rebound to its former support level at $3.25 or so.  It won't go much further than that, though, I don't think.  If you can, put in a limit order to sell at 3.25 and wait for it to tick back up.  And yes, you did get lucky this time.  You should really keep a closer eye on your positions...
c2aabed26d573505ce71ae1375e57c83aa	Ha!  You get the same newsletters as I do.  Use Marketwatch.com and the Internet for better research.  I found it in like five minutes.  It is called Syntroleum.  Ticker:SYNM.  You can't really believe everything this guy says, you know.  That engine that he keeps hawking, well it is still basically on the drawing board and the design is more for large-scale commercial aplications than it is to run an automobile.  There is supposed to be (another) test of the engine late this summer.  Don't hold your breath on that on.  And...  he doesn't mention about Syntroleum that, while they have patents on all this stuff, it still takes way too much energy to create the fuel than it is worth.  He says the fuel is a viable alternative with oil over $50bbl.  What he fails to mention is that the added energy needed to make the fuel raise the target price to about $82bbl for it to be cost-effective.  All I did was look up the method described in the newsletter and I had it on my desktop.  Also, Wikipedia is very helpful for these things...the Fischer-Tropf Method (sp.?) FT fuel.  That is where I found out that it is not quite as cost effective as this guy wants us to believe.|`|AA10739550	you may be talking about Rentech....rtk

Monetary policy should be used to spur growth and to get people working.  Fiscal policy should be used to keep taxes low and let people start their own businesses.  More business, more people working, more income from taxation.  Supply-side economics.  Read Lawrence Kudrow, he can tell you.  Even if the goverment has to go into debt to jump-start an economy, it may be necessary to do that.  The important thing is to put the monies from taxes back into the government so that their bonds are worth something, and to keep the monies out of the pockets of low-life dictators.

Any advertisment of an opportunity that wants money up from is not legitimate.  Don't get involved and don't waste your time or money.    Think about it logically.  If you were to be paid for remote typing, how would the information be transported to you for you to read and then type into some sort of document, form or database?    Transporting the information to you for you to type will cost something to accomplish.  That cost could be postal, freight or labor needed to scan and email/upload to you.  That cost, whether for physical transport or clerical scanning/sending is  going to be higher than paying someone locally to type.

c2aabed26d573505ce71ae1375e57c83aa	Yes, Microsoft stock will close at $29.87 on Friday, 26 January 2007 then gap up on Monday, the next trading day to over $30.    There are several reasons for this:  First, stocks in general will be making a rebound after a major, major sell-off in October and November 2007.  (Did I mention major?)  Second, Microsoft will have a successful launch of their new OS Vista and Office Software bundles.  Third, they will announce that sales of their new Mp3 player that competes with the iPod were much, much better than expected over the Holiday season.  Fourth, Google will announce for the second time that they are cutting forecasts on revenue, citing overseas difficulties.  The problem will be, found out only later, that their pay-per-click model isn't working as well as expected and they are lagging the industry in a new business model to combat this growing problem.  By that time, Microsoft will have stepped in and gobbled up an extreme amount of market-share of the on-line advertising from them, as has Yahoo!.  Fifth, every fund and his brother owns Microsoft to such an extent that if all the funds dumped their shares, the very funds themselves would collapse with nowhere else to go.  They have to hold their shares and they will be rewarded for it, making them look like reluctant geniuses.  Truth is that they got caught with their pants down and Microsoft saved the day for them.

It should be all over with before February 2007 here in Houston.  Until then, people will be panicked, etc., and it is just not a pretty scene.  According to my calculations, you should be able to pick up some brand new houses with builder discounts in Cinco Ranch and Grand Lakes.  Sugar Land would also be a good place to look.  Best advice, wait until after the Fannie Mae report comes out later this summer, after the stock market crash and the credit crunch to go for it.  You won't pay a whole lot less because Houston is pretty much insulated from this for a number of factors, but you will save yourself a ton of worry and hand-wringing.

Each individual company is different. Its psychologically hard to ignore the index...but once you get used to it, you will probably really try to understand the companies you are interested in.    Study the market, books, reports of : DELL, MSFT, ORCL,  INTC, etc    A lot of these companies are having problems.

Whenever there is something going on in the company, they are required by law to release this information.  If people are trading before that, it is called "insider trading" and that is frowned upon by the United States Government and there are very stiff penalties involved.  Second, go to the website http://www.sec.gov/ and type in the name of the company you are researching.  Go to their SEC filings, including their 10-K filings, which will tell you all about the financial health of the company.  Learn to read the charts.  Basically,if they are making more money and paying down debt, have fewer shares outstanding, then they are in good shape and getting better.  Also, you can go to http://www.marketwatch.com/ and sign up for an Email Alert for the company, too.  Just type in the name AND the ticker symbol and when there is any news for the company, they will send it to you in your email as soon as it is released.

c2aabed26d573505ce71ae1375e57c83aa	Mr. Dredude is correct but there are ways to beat the volatility factor, which is the one that will make options worthwhile or make you nothing.  Try to find stocks that have as little volatility in them as possible that are about to make a major move.  He is right in that these guys have teams of people adjusting these prices all day long.  A five cent tick is worth potentially millions, so they have to be careful.  My theory is to go around those guys by looking at the underlying equity.  Don't concentrate on the option itself but on the stock that just streams along and suddenly your trusted indicators say is going to break out either to the upside or downside.  If you buy at a low volatility, the price is relatively cheap.  When it starts to move, the prices are adjusted at the exchanges for volatility and the price goes up.  That's what you want to happen.    Take Honda Motor and Google.  HMC options are relatively cheap as compared to Google because Honda is so much less volatile.  When Honda makes a large move to the upside or downside, your return is much greater because you paid so much less for the volatility.    You can get an options calculator and adjust it for yourself to see some "what-if" scenarios.  You can get it at http://www.cboe.com/ under the Educational Tools section.  It is free.  You can learn a lot from the CBOE.    Best of luck to you!|`|AA10167681	You need an option analysis program or some type of screener on an internet service, or a newsletter that does it for you. But there's always a catch.    Option pricing models give a good estimate of the option's price, if you can accurately describe what is going to happen to the underlying price and its volatility. Of course, that's an impossible task, so all you can do is get a fair idea, or close, like horseshoes, except this ain't horseshoes.    It doesn't matter which pricing model you use -- they are not substantially different -- but you need some form of a model. You are on the right track, and see that trading options without one is foolhardy, and puts you at an extreme disadvantage.    One of the benefits of a model is that it can give you estimates of what-if situations. One of the simplest is the delta of the option.    You also need a good handle on the time decay, or theta. It is usually a negative number.    But the number that will give you the most trouble is volatility; historical volatility is pretty easy, to obtain, but how does it change, and which way? Implied volatility, the volatility component built into the option price, is something you're trying to determine in the future. So you'll also need a crystal ball. It's a prediction.     If you want to try taking a look at the option pricing formala, the original one is called the Black Scholes model, and is easily obtained. But you won't want to mess with it, or try coming up with all of those numbers every day, let alone intraday.     You don't give us much information here about what you're trying to do, whether to buy options or write them., or do calendar spreads or ratio spreads or straddles, etc.     Mispricing is handled quickly in today's technological environment, and there are teams of people that hedge these things out of existence. You're messing with the big boys here, and Joe Public doesn't have an advantage.    The only way I've found to take advantage of these situations is to have an intraday data feed for options, and get to know the range of premium fluctuation, then anticipate the over/under pricing at extreme volatility. Psychologically, this will be the most challenging aspect of the trader, to trade against the market when it comes crashing down to your number, or takes off like a rocket and you are supposed to sell it. Not many can do it, or have the financial backing to do it.    This looks doable to the novice, but you should probably get a few more years experience with options before you try it. Your conventional definition of "underpriced" has no place here.|`|605ed7d9a96abb238726f8307829bebdaa	1.Use Black Scholes Model .    2.

Learn the basics of Japanese Candlestick charting and learn to use those indicators to trade.  Stocks behave in unpredictable fashion sometimes but having a "system" to figure out which ones will rise and which ones will fall takes work.  Sorry.  Not so simple.

c2aabed26d573505ce71ae1375e57c83aa	Yes, Marvell Technology Group stock will continue its decline.  It has set a new 52-week low and has broken through its support level here at $33.  The next level of any substantial support appears to be at around $29 but that support is rather sparse.    Technology stocks and semiconductor stocks in general are going to take a whipping over the next six months.  I fully expect the stock to slide to its initial support level of two years ago and settle at about $24/share.  One way to play it is to take some out-of-the-money Put Options on the stock.  The Jan 07 $25 Puts (.UVMME) are now trading for about $0.60 (sixty cents...) and I can see the stock moving toward that level over the next two and a half months.

AA11113975	Wow... It always amazes me how people view the governement as one cohesive entity, where everyone from the janitor to the elected officials have a say in the budget and operations.  It is equally amazing how there is some perception of prefferential treatment, outstanding benefit packages, etc.    First off, "government workers" are just regular people who do not have much of a say in budgetary issues.  In every level of government, there are finance committees that create a budget based on tax income (income tax, tariffs, B&O, Hotel/Motel, Personal Property, etc.) and the needs of the departments under their realm of control.  These committees are made up of your elected officials who actually make decisions with only very few administrative workers who only serve to make departmental needs known.  So, I wouldn't be so quick to 'blame' government workers for budgetary woes.  They often get paid MUCH less than what they would if they worked in the private sector and work just as hard.... so it would follow that you keep your cheap labor, if anything.    I work for a municipal governement in a capital city.  The reason my job is secure is that, unlike a corporation where departments and divisions are added and cut based on profit and loss, my job is still necessary no matter the state of the budget.  The things that are cut back when a budget crisis arises are capital goods.... new vehicles and equipment are put on the backburner.      So, Mr. Taxpayer what would you rather have your money spent on..... civil services or retraining an underpaid workforce.  I'm sure you've heard that it is much more expensive to recruit employees and train new employees rather than maintain current ones.  That hold true much moreso in government becuase the wages are already low, there are no bonuses, and the only overtime paid is to police and fire personnel.    Take it easy on the little guy. If you are corporate, jsut know that the higher salary you get comes at the risk of decreased job security and being a slave to the success of your company, industry, and market.        **************************************...  In response to your additional details..    While you may not be against government workers, you very well may be a little jealous.  Layoffs are not common in government like they are in the private sector.  They are just two completely different organization types.  Layoffs occur in the private sector because demand falls or a product/service is being killed by the competition.  In the case of a major parent company like Proctor and Gamble, if toothpaste isnt performing well and baby powder is doing great guess who gets laid off.   The demand for government remains relatively even and there is no competition.  I really dont know if it gets much clearer than that.      I really dont know what politicians you are talking about.  On the state level, Senate and House members are, in effect, part-time salaried workers.  In my state, a state level senator will pull a whopping $15-18K a year, not including per diem during sessions which is about $90-100 a day, and also paid travel mileage.  Their pension isnt by any means heavy either. It is about 50% of their official pay, and thats only if they are old enough.  So they will have that 8K a year pension, then they could have a pension from their private sector job as well.  There is nothing wrong with any of that.  Other government folks can do much better than that.  Police and Fire folks can retire from their post once they reach the proper age at 50% of average of their two highest pay years, then get re-hired to perform another job.  After they pass the service year requirement, they can then retire from that post as well.  The heavy part you may be thinking of is that the calculation of the highest pay years INCLUDES overtime pay so an officer that is salaried at $40K. may in fact have been paid close to $70K because he worked his *** off for 80 hours a week.  So then his pension will be close to his base salary.  Sorry buddy, I dont know what to tell you, people get paid for what they put inits not really luck.    Finally, in times of a major crisis like a flood, I can see salaried government workers still being paid because they have vacation days and sick days that the administration can pull from and still pay workers.  Yes, they still get paid, but their vacation time goes away, and nobody ever hears about that part of the equation. If it happened to be an extended shut down, they still pay their people for the reasons I discussed above.  If you dont pay people, they quit, and if they quit, you have hire new people at great cost.  But that goes back to government workers a.k.a. the little guy, rather than politicians.

I know this doesnt sound like a ton of money, but for a little time as I invest in this the return is great. AND the best part is the return isn't month to month, the return is comprehensive.

Nothing but a place to stay in until the lease expires. Do you get a tax write off? No. A share in the property's appreciation? Not a chance.     If you can get out of this lease, do it. Then talk to a Realtor and a mortgage broker. As soon as you've been qualified, pick up one of the many bargains there are out there now and start building your future.|`|93e5968d10c5d457bc58c4bf0c325d37aa	One answer - read the contract and find out!  If there is something about "best effort', then you're hosed, if it says that the unit will be ready, then landlord didn't uphold his part of the agreement.    You're not done yet - then read the part of the agreement on dispute resolution - sometimes they make you go to binding arbitration, or something else, it doens't always mean that you can walk.

I have to assume, since rates went up recently, that you probably have a very good rate on your existing loan.  A refinance may increase your payments on that debt so it would not be a good choice.      However if you have an adjustable rate mortgage which is increasing each year, then a refinance to a more fixed loan, and reamortizing the loan may actually net you some cash, with the same or very little extra payment, while locking in a new rate.    You really need to give me more details on you current situation or sit and talk with a reputable loan officer or Realtor.

Refinancing is re-doing the existing loans on the property.    As to which is worse and which is better, that depends upon a lot of factors.  What rates are available now versus what rates you have.  Your equity picture.  Your credit.  And so on.  The idea is to have the lowest interest charges, as long as the payments are something you can afford.|`|38224f567fc1a596ddac3d08a8396c6caa	Refinancing your home loan is more than likely your best choice. when you refinance you are really just taking out a new loan on your home, and will have one payment like you do now. When you choose a second mortgage you will have your original payment plus a second payment on the amount that you take out on the equity that you have in your home.|`|d9170e5b900bf6415c3c642f11eea32eaa	with a second mortgage you are creating another opportunity to get further in debt. with having two separate loans you are creating two different interest rates. which means you are paying more through out the course of the loan. When you refinance you are consolidating all of your debt into one payment and into one interest rate.  You can cash out and use the money for home improvement of maybe a vacation...i recommend refinancing!.....my husband works for home funds direct.. he a loan officer and can help you refinance in a week....give him call call if you need help...his name is mark fragola 714-244-2446.|`|b9083f222a46830e191cd47b0a2b4216aa	One is not worse than the other, the question is, what is the right thing to do economically--in YOUR case?

You can avoid paying this tax legally if you purchase residential property of the same amount, within a span of two years.    Another way of avoiding the tax is to invest in bonds under the capital gains scheme for three years. Interest on these bonds is low.

The key element to keep in mind  in regards to the market to-at the pump price is that by the time the commodity reaches the pump there are freight fees, taxes, and some regional variance due to pipeline constraints and and regional demand. So movement of the underlying commodity will effect the base price at retail, but with all the adjustments, it is sometimes hardly recognizable.

Appraisers are not limited to doing appraisals, but also can do consultations and reviews of other appraisers' work.    - The amount of experience the appraiser has (with more experience, an appraiser can do their work more quickly and will be able to work on more complex assignments)    - The type of appraisal license - does the appraiser have a license that allows them to appraise residential or a commercial properties? Commerical appraisers tend to make more than residential appraisers because the work is more compex and commerical appraisal require more depth of analysis.    - Place of employement - Are you working solo or with an appraisal office. Solo appraisers will gain 100% of the fee and set their own hours. Salary structures and working hours at appraisal offices vary from one appraisal office to another.

It is unlikely things will brighten up in a few months, afterall, this bubble took 5 years for form.    It might be better to give some discount so you unload the house quickly and can use the gain of the home to make money elsewhere quickly.  At the same time, you will save money by not paying mortgage for the next 5 months.    For example, if mortgage is $2500/mo. and you have $300,000 gain sitting in the house, by selling it now rather than 5 months later will save you $12500.  It will also earn you as much as $7000 from interests (Assuming CD are paying 5.5% or higher).    Total financial benefit for selling early would be $20,000.  I would give buyer some discount just because of that.    Finally, keeping a house in selling condition is a lot of work.  If your realtor does staging, it costs extra to rent furnitures.  If you are living in the unit, it takes extra effort to keep it clean.  So, sell it fast!    http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/08/real_est...  http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/05/real_est...

Check into the maintenance fees before you purchase. I know a lot of people who have purchased an apartment or condominium only to have to pay as much in maintenance fees as other people that are only paying their rent. For example in my building I pay $799 for three bedrooms other people in here have purchased their condos for over $100, 000 and are paying $650 in maintenance fees. A two bedroom in my building rents for $720. They end up paying their mortgage loan on top of these fees. This does not seem to make any sense since they will have to pay the maintenance fees for the rest of their time in the building. Just thought you might want to know.|`|AA12276600	the price correction that is occuring in the US will probably effect us here.  The market is predicted to rise, but may plateau for a while this year as there is more product on the market than last year, and it is staying on the market for more days than it was last year.

Give them some time to make amends (roughly a few days - they will likely reship or dispute it was delivered).    If this fails, then contact the issuer of your credit card (bank) and notify them that you would like to dispute the transaction.  They will likley have you file a formal dispute (written) describing the details of the transaction.  They will in turn contact the merchant to request certain information, including shipment details.  If the merchant fails to provide the information in a timely manner, or cannot verify delivery - the dispute will become a 'chargeback' - and the merchant will be required to provide delivery confirmation.

AA10491538	Your best weapon is you and your business cards.  The more money you spend on ads and marketing, the faster you will make yourself become a statistic of people who have "tried" the industry because they heard about someone who was doing so well.  What they didn't further explain, is that this same successful person has been building his/her client base for the past 10 years and has focused his efforts on his existing client base.  That base will grow through word of mouth... but it takes years to grow.  You don't have a base? Yes, you do.  You start with your friends and family.  If you won't do this, you have no business being in sales.  Your friends and family are your own marketing team. Next, is all the networking groups you belong to; sports teams, church groups, BNI http://www.highenergylunch.com/memberdir... Leads Club, Chamber of Commerce.  Your referrals come from those who know and trust you.  Consistency over time will get you referrals.  Make sure you always dress to a "T". Suit and tie is a must.  Just because you can get away with wearing kakis... should you?  Someone wants to work with someone who takes themselves seriously and what they do for a living seriously.  If you don't, your clients surely won't.  Eye contact, shaking hands, and handing out your business card is how you do it.  It's hard.

e05801df50648b30b812a673c83b5eadaa	You have to talk to the person in charge or else you are wasting your time.      I would inspect the building if possible and determine where the areas are that are "NOT" being cleaned.  It always amazes me actually how filthy some offices are that have professional cleaners.      If at all possible when you get an appointment with the person in charge see if they will walk around the building with you and have "them" point out the trouble spots.  Sometimes all it takes is for them to take the time to actually see how well their office is being cleaned or not cleaned which is most likely.  At this point, you better take mental notes and explain how your service will see to those details.  The key is people will tell you, if you listen, what their hot buttons are.  It is different for everyone.  Someone may want blinds cleaned and probably doesn't notice anything else, or someone's hot button maybe baseboards.  So listen and they will tell you.  When you get the contract you had better take care of those things they mentioned because believe me they will be watching.  Also the most common item that seems never to be cleaned is real or artificial flowers/plants.  So far I haven't found one office yet that these are cleaned.  Public areas are the most important, but don't forget the employees will also notice what is "not" being cleaned and if possible talk to them.      Hope this helps.  I own and operate a cleaning service and I am not cheap but I am always completely booked because I not only promise superior cleaning I also provide it.  Also if they say that "so and so" is here three hours and they obviously are not getting the job done, you better make sure you quote for enough hours to do the job right, but don't abuse this or you will be out the door.|`|AA10975888	Solicitation is always the best way.    Start by trying to find out who owns/manages the office buidlings in your area and try and get an appointement with them to present your services. Put together, a prospectus of your company, menu of services and prices. Do a walk thru of the bldg and go back with a definite quote based on the customers needs.    Keep in mind that some offices have cleaning services provided as part of their lease agmt. So going directly to the property managers, owners is the best way.|`|b9d6a217510596f11f29ebc4d5b5a4f0aa	Hello, first off I would print flyers and hang every where you can think of...(stores,resturants,post office,etc)I would then run an ad in all the local newspapers, and the papers in surrounding counties...also,word of mouth works very well...tell everyone you know and ask them to please tell everyone they know...(this works).... be sure to run a "special" of some sort for the first few people who you clean for....charge them a really low rate to begin with....sort of like an introductory offer....and if they like you and decide to stick with you...you change up your rates somewhat...

d3920179c0c6134de7306d62c2807d1faa	I'm interviewing a few candidates on Monday.  We work in a lucrative field, but with quieter coworkers generally.      1.  Be confident, but don't be smug.  2.  Try to show some knowledge of a company, but look to ask questions to expand what you know.  3.  Be polite and share yourself with the interviewer.  In the end we want someone who we can work around.  4. Don't mention salary immediately, not unless things are going great and they say they'll offer you the position.  5.  Be yourself!  Relax... even if it's hard to do at first.  Breathe and relax.  6. Always write thank you's.  Email thank you's are all right, sometimes better because you showed your gratitude for their time before the other interviewee.

On top of that, to be a truly great sales person, you must believe in your product and be able to make comparative statements that bolster your presentation of the product.    If you have any personal doubts or doubts about the product you're trying to sell, it will show.  Especially if you're a naturally honest person.  Your doubts will nag at you and that will show through in your presentation or pitch.  People are not sheep, they are mostly savvy and will see through someones uncertainty and you'll lose the sale.    So be careful and be positive.  If you believe in yourself and your product, selling come naturally and you will suceed.

It's still something I have to remind myself of but it works and it makes sense. No doesn't create a positive or negative result so therefore it is considered neutral. It doesn't ever change anything and half the time in sales no might only mean not right now. What company were you thinking about signing up with? Have you done research on the company?

nAl7Weccaa	Accountants originally worked only in public practice, selling advice and services to other individuals and businesses, but today, in addition, many work within private corporations, the financial industry and various government bodies.    Accountants are independent business advisers, they are in a position to help the clients build and develop their businesses. Accountants can offer an extensive range of service    Accountants, who are legally registered auditors, may audit a company's accounts - such an audit may, in some circumstances, be required by law.      Accountants also can provide a variety of services that improve and assure the quality of information, or its context, for business decision-making. And also be ensuring that financial statements reflect fairly the financial performance of the company.    Preventing, detecting, and investigating financial frauds such as embezzlement, securities fraud, tax evasion, and money-laundering schemes. Demand for this specialty has grown significantly as a result of recent corporate scandals.    Addressing how companies can be both environmentally responsible and profitable. This includes focusing the variety of projects like environmental compliance audits and managing and preventing claims and disputes.    Accountants may set up systems to ensure that the clients know how their businesses are performing. Additional services offered include budgeting and performance monitoring and helping to ensure that a business runs in a smooth and efficient manner.    Accountants may offer advice on how to finance a business and how to buy or sell a business, as well as other related considerations. Such as providing a variety of services to organizations and individuals that interpret and add value by utilizing a wide range of financial information.      Accountants are able to offer advice on tax including corporation tax, income tax, capital gains tax.   Business advisers can also offer tax planning advice and minimize your tax liability now and in the future.    Accountants can provide independent advice to managers of businesses        Accountants &auditors keep track of a company's money.   The company's managers and people outside the company read their reports.   Managers look at the accountants' reports to see how well their companies are doing. Governments use the reports to tell how much tax a company should pay.   Some people read them to decide if they want to do business with the company. Others use them to decide if they want to lend money to the company or not.    There are 4  kinds of accountants.        1 Public accountants work for public accounting companies. They do accounting, auditing, tax, and consulting work. Some have their own businesses.   They do many different kinds of accounting for people outside the company.      2 Management accountants keep track of the money spent and made by the companies for which they work.      3  Internal auditors make sure that a company's accounting records are right. They check the records to see that no one in the company is stealing&also check to see that no one in the company is wasting the company's money.      4 Government accountants and auditors make sure that government accounting records are right & check the records of people doing business with the government.    Accountants& auditors work in offices.   They generally work a standard 40-hour week, but some work 50 hours a week or more. Tax accountants often work long hours during the tax season, from January to April.   Accountants working for the government and public companies travel to audit other companies or branches of their own company.|`|AA11464583	Math.|`|6sx95Ig8aa	count other peoples money|`|b69f4963fbf4a6d7284077c67db64f27aa	keeps your books in order. help file your taxes.gives you tax advise etc and more|`|K9zJLtxjaa	There are many aspects to business including understanding the customers, the buying, the people and they are all interellated. An accountants role is to understand the financial aspects of the business for two reasons     1) to control the costs and profits  2) to make sure everyone else understands them and what is going on    Being an accountant can be quite technical knowing how to do things and knowing the rules but because it also gives an excellent understanding of the business if you want to do more provides an excellent platform to do other things in business later on.
9yurQ85Eaa	SAME THING IS HAPPENING TO ME. I GO TO THE IRS WEB SITE THEY SAY I GOT BACK 600 WHEN IN FACT I ONLY GOT BACK 300 MY BANK IS TRACKING DOWN THE DEPOSIT I MADE SO I CAN GIVE THAT TO THE IRS AND THEY CAN GO FROM THERE.  THIS TO IS HOLDING UP MY REFUND.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Go here and verify the amount real-time from the IRS.  This is from YOUR tax account.    https://sa2.www4.irs.gov/irfof/IRServlet...    If this says $1500, you got $1500.  It might have been offset for back taxes or child support or student loan, but you use the pre-offset amount.    For married couples with children, it was $600-$1200 for the parents and $300 for each child under the age of 17.  If you had 3 children, you most certainly could get $1500 even if you didn't pay a dime in tax.
NwkZ5OmCaa	The IRS is not on these boards.  They have enough to do answering the phones to monitor anything here.    If you had $3000 or more of Income (not withholding and the $3000 could include combat pay), you, your wife and your children under the age of 17 were eligible for $300 each.  If you and your wife actually paid $1200 in tax, the amount for you and your wife could have been $600 each.    As for "I know for a fact" did you get a check or direct deposit?  How many children do you have that are under the age of 17?  Did you do your 2007 taxes correctly and not screw up the names, ssns or check boxes for your children?  (VERY few people forgot the check boxes and that was fixed by late summer.)  Does the IRS say you got ONE check or TWO checks?    Before submitting the 3911, I'd make darn sure I had my facts right.  It would be pretty dumb if you had a direct deposit for $1500 and claimed you didn't.  Or signed a check and forgot you deposited it.|`|8yQYmxVOaa	Married filing either joint or separate, if separate wife got $600 plus the $300 for kid in other words the whole amount due was paid, can't collect twice on same SSN number.|`|91ff4dbbfbd7827f11b99d3972e133e1aa	After reading your statement, there couldve been an error on IRS side  but you do need to prove it, a question that comes to mind, is did you  claim any of yur children, if not maybe the IRS somewhow sent the  other half to the chioldren  Or go to the bank/company where you  cashed/deposited it, they should keep a copy of the check or deposit  amount, dates, sometimes I can even see the checks ive sent online  but you will have to track it down to see what happened or get some  form of explanation.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I asked my friends to check the irs website that tells you how much you got and everyone I know found that it was correct and told them the correct amount that they received.
fSlZQzS4aa	IRS doesn't do it at all.  It notifies the Treasury Dept Bureau of Accounts who makes the deposits on its schedule.|`|5DJcir9saa	I know they send out checks twice a week and I thought they did deposits twice a week as well, but maybe not.  With the economy the way it is this year, there are a lot of people who want their refunds ASAP so I think people are filing a lot earlier this year if they know they have some $$$$ coming to them.  So that could be the cause for the delay.|`|fEnKOqJvaa	i hade and student loan in 1989 the irs been taking my taxes for the past 17years. but the irs never paid my student loan. this year 2009 i was happy becuases it was time to get a puch in life. the irs tuck from me 4,400.00 with the ecuses to paid the student loan more the 24,000.00 dollars when the statud of  limitation is 5 years to collected a db. not only that never got credit for missing child. wow! i love the usa. we are lossing are right as a usa american.guess what? 24,000 dollars student loan still not paid. irs i will see u in court|`|a5b6eaf1e6e065c5886203f517c6f330aa	Welcome to the CLUB!

3a37c6d3eb9e914f155df7ad545276f4aa	Legally he cannot tell your health condition.  There is a law called HIPPA which prevents disclose of health information with out your written consent.  It may be no big deal but what  if it was.  I ended up in a psych hospital in Nov. and my manager told every one I was in the hospital with pneumonia.  Thanks to that there were no weird questions to try to answer after wards.  If he had said I was in a psych hospital there would have been serious legal ramifications.|`|4ys766Ewaa	ABSOLUTLEY!!! The disclosure of one's personal information, regardless of it's significance, to ANYONE other than a law enforcement agency with the proper warrant is illegal! If this person is disclosing personal health information, who's is to say he/she is not giving out other information that could very well lead to identity theft. This person is obviously not trustworthy in this position!|`|PzrbJrGcaa	Absolutely not.  This is the HIPPA law.  No employer or management personnel can reveal any medical history or information what so ever.  There are a few exceptions to this, and I am not sure what they are, but I believe there is an exception when the situation has put the public's or anothers life in danger, such as having TB or Hep C or HIV and exposing others to it.  Others can be told they have been exposed, but I do not believe that they can be told by whom.

77572a80bd52c9ac41f018aff97424c1aa	Todas las tarjetas de credito convienen, en especial la walmart ya que al ser una compa?ia muy fuerte te abre la puerta a otras instituciones crediticias.    La tarjeta walmart es una tarjeta de autoservicio y te sirve principalmnete para hacer compras en tiendas y restaurantes de la cadena walmart.    Pero uno de sus mejores  atractivos son que te permite comprar ciertos articulos en mensualidades sin intereses. Esto aplica a rticulos grandes como refrigeradores, televisiones, lectores dvd, redios, llantas, colchones etc.    Por ah mencionan las comisiones altas, pero la verdad es que si eliges bien y si compras aprovechando las ofertas de 12 meses sin intereses, te sale baratisimo comprar en walmart y sobre todo,  consigues comprar cosas que de otra forma te seria imposible (una sala por ejemplo).    Claro, debes ser cuidadoso y procurar no gastar mas de lo que ganas, sobre todo debes pagar en la feche y nunca atrazaste. Si vas liquidando tus saldos asi como van lelgando ten la seguridad que no tendras problema alguno y que no te cobraran intereses.    Si solo pagas los minimos entonces si te cobran intereses, pero sirve por que te permite hacer gastos grandes en epocas dificiles y reponer lo gastado luego cuando la situacion mejore. Por ejemplo, ayuda mucho en las fiestas de fin de a?o, pagas con tu tarjeta todo lo que necesitas, y luego liquidas el saldo con tu siguiente cheque ya en enero.    Son muy utilies, lo unico es no tenerles miedo y ser cuidadoso para no gastar mas de lo que efectivamente ganas y poderlas pagar a tiempo.    ?Saludos!|`|B2aloViDaa	hola amigo la verdad no te conviene te cobran muchisimo de interes y sales pagando lo doble de lo que cuesta y ademas las quincenas son muy altas la tarjeta wal mart no te conviene, te recomiendo comprar en coopel es mas economico y no te friegan acada rato es mas bajo el interes y no te piden muchos requisitos y eso de manejar tarjetas de credito tienes que saber manejarlas para no sobregirarte y pagar a tiempo y los interes te comen debes de ser muy responsable en tus pagos y tratar de liquidar lo antes posible yo tuve una experiencia y me esta costando trabajo salir de ellas, te recomiendo que solo ocupes una. puede ser bancome o banamex bismat y paga a 12 o 24 mensualidades sin intereses es lo mejor no te endrogues con muchas sigue mi consejo no enbarques e investiga la tasa anual de cada uno de los bancos entre mas bajo sea, mejor y elige una que puedan recibir en cualquier establecimiento porque no todas las aceptan. ojo amigo elige bien y la verdad es mejor no tenerlas asi gastas solo lo que tienes en la mano.|`|5ynMqCtXaa	te sugiero entres a la pagina de la condusef que es www.condusef.gob.mx ahi podras encontrar algunas recomendaciones asi como , calculadoras para que veas y simules como se comportaria tu credito, es decir si debes $XX.xx cuanto tiempo tardarias en pagarlo y cuale seria el importe de tus pagos , cuando hagas varios ejercicios decide si el credito que te dan, que es atravez de bancomer, es manejable dentro de tu economia o no.

Pero de bes de considerar antes aceptarla,es la comision anual que anda sobre los $450.00 que debe de considerarse como costo de financiamiento,y esto quiere decir que  si tus compras son pequenas y esporadicas te sera mas conveniente pagar en efectivo.Yo estoy por cancelarla,por que mis compras son muy escasas en esa cadena de establecimientos,hay tarjetas mas convenientes como una de hsbc que  te reembolsan hata 5% de tu compra,y la pudes usar en todos lados.Asi que piensalo bien|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	Aceptala, es muy buena, ademas es una buena manera de empezar un historial de credito
OlHFq87waa	Depending on the area, the convenience a website provides could be enough to entice a potential customer. Also,they might appear not to sell anything except classes, but I always wondered if the studios get any kickback from companies from the sales of costumes and oufits the kids are required to have for shows.
Ur09nnclaa	I honestly dont have faith in the fact that it will be there but if it is please let us know. I filed and was accepted on the 19th and money was supposed to be deposited on the 30th. Nothing in my account. Now the irs site says the tenth, but it was to my understanding that the irs ony does weekly deposits every friday, not on odd days like tuesday or wednesday. Because of this, I am hoping that it will be in my account this Friday, the 6th and not on the 10th.|`|WYzVw19Uaa	alot of Filers Tax Refunds have been delayed due to the Recovery Rebate and a glitch in the system|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	Come back on February 4th.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	it's only the 2nd. wait another day.|`|SEwqwjPkaa	But today is the second...I would think you would at least need to wait until tomorrow.

yyZeOAONaa	First of all, congrats on being a stay at home dad.  Most of us men can't or won't do it.  I'm not a stay at home dad, but I spend more time with my kids than most stay at home moms do.    Internet sales and marketing is a tough business.  With search engines changing the rules all of the time, ie Google, it makes it nearly impossible to stay on top.  Let's not even talk about the cost.    There is a relatively new approach called attraction marketing.  Attraction marketing is basically getting people to chase you down.  It's opposite from the traditional marketing approach.  You don't bombard people with a message until it sticks.  You learn to position yourself so that individuals looking for your skills, knowledge, or products will come seeking you out.    There are a number of companies that teach this approach.  I use Renegade University.  I highly recommend what they teach.  They do offer a trial period for free.
bFLP6COgaa	How would you do that, since your taxes are withheld from your paycheck every week?|`|cwKNDZz9aa	Awesome idea!!!!!      You start. I'll jump in as soon as I see it's working.

HmiFGACXaa	When you receive payment since you are a cash basis
Svanlzg7aa	Choose, "specified dollar amount". Put in the amount you want to pay.   The first option is to pay the full balance owed, the second is for paying the minimum payment they specify.
K7x1RHVFaa	To begin with, your father should not claim you if you make this much money. He needs to show that he paid more than 50% of your living expenses, meaning more than twice your 9972.54, basically 20,000 dollars. If he can show that then he can deduct you, otherwise he can not. He also has to show he pays for where you live and that you are in fact a full time student.    Filing single you should get back 451.05    Filing as a dependent you should you get 99.05     But your income argues that you can not be a dependent.    And the why is because you deductions drop from 8950 down to 5450 raising your taxes owed by 362 dollars and reducing you rebate by the same. Your dad is getting your 3500 dollar personal exemption.    You should tell him he owed you 362.|`|82d08fd822e2036932a49a3ffc4ff5e4aa	You said state tax return was 99 dollars that is correct. You only paid in129 in state taxes. If you are talking about your federal taxes then you need to understand that your father claimed your exception so you could not claim it. Actually since you earned 9973 he should not have claimed you unless he paid more than 9973 out on you. He is saying he supported you so the gov will not let you claim that you supported yourself. If you made the same thing last year and this year and your father claimed you last year and they took out the same last year as this year you should be getting close to the same thing. Either you are mistaken about last years and this years differences are who ever did your return made a mistake, take them and have someone else check it.
AA11206283	I'm avoiding properties that have big issues. Being foreclosed is a big issue.    If you choose to go there, make sure you get an owner's title insurance issue.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	I'll address your question regarding buying foreclosed homes.  Yes, they're usually priced very low, however in most cases you are buying "as is."  While the bank may permit you to have the property inspected by a professional inspection service, they won't let you cancel the contract if the inspection report is not to your satisfaction.  My advise is to make your offer subject to an inspection and you have the option to cancel based on the inspection.  Some banks won't accept that, but there are many foreclosed homes on the market, so keep trying.  Also, they're usually firm on the price, so don't be surprised if you offer is rejected.    realtor.sailor|`|HmiFGACXaa	Look at regular listings as well. Most of these homes are priced lower because of all the foreclosures.     Many of the regular listings are in much better shape than foreclosures. With a forclosure, you buy it as is. Who knows what kind of repairs will be needed. Think about it, it they couldn't afford the payment, they probably didn't keep up with the maintenance.|`|2ADjGm9haa	We just bought our house on November here in AZ. The house was a forclosure and we got a great deal on it. We got our house over 50,000 less than what the private sellers are selliing there houses for on our block. Keep in mind that most forclosures are not in good shape. The owners either were mad when they left or they were just not good housekeepers. But you can also be lucky like us and get a newer house. Our house is only 2 years old and is good shape.|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	watch buying a foreclosed home. have it inspected, some homes get destroyed before & after people move out of it.|`|IUQzWrb7aa	You don't indicate your financial assets and/or objectives. While foreclosed  homes may seem like a good deal, keep in mind that if the owner has fallen behind on monthly mortgage payments, he/she may have also fallen behind on regular maintenance, and you may find a home that "needs lots of work".
QUCIdBp5aa	Do this yourself in just a few minutes and get your refund faster.     http://www.irs.gov/app/freeFile/jsp/inde...    Personally, I recommend TaxAct.|`|cwKNDZz9aa	Why are you wasting your time on this mindless excuse for an activity instead of completing your return?      We're not the sharpest knife in the drawer, now, are we?|`|AA10730159	like 6500
5Gxll9Hkaa	For the vast majority of bankruptcy filers, the bankruptcy has no effect on taxes.  However for a very, very small minority there may be some adjustments necessary to their tax returns.  This can occur in (uncommon) situations in which capital gains were realized from the trustee's sale of some kinds of assets to pay creditors (which usually doesn't happen in Ch 13).  You still get the mortgage interest tax deduction while you are in Ch 13, assuming that you are still paying your mortgage.    Also (a word to the wise...) many bankruptcy attorneys are excellent attorneys in the areas in which they practice, but aren't really very well versed in tax law.  If you have tax questions you may be better off asking a tax professional than asking your bankruptcy attorney (and your bankruptcy attorney may even so advise you).
p2J4i6Aiaa	No. Hope it will come Friday!|`|0QRDC2R1aa	Nope, not me.......still just says that if there are no processing delays or I owe other taxes, that I should expect to have my refund by February 10th.........|`|m45HPQx6aa	I didn't recieve mine yet and also changed from the 3rd to the 10th of Feb  and my co-worker filed Janaury 9th and her date change and she has never received it so whats up?|`|y46FXf62aa	I am hoping it comes Friday but I will not count on it.

It is stating on the website that its the 10th. Who the heck really knows.|`|SEwqwjPkaa	Mine was also changed from the 3rd to the 10th.  But nothing as of 2 minutes ago.  Also, many around the Answers board are stating that recovery rebate processing is delaying the issuance of refunds.  I was on the IRS site a moment ago and noticed an update they posted regarding this last friday.  Looks like the recovery rebates have NOTHING to do with the delays...just normal processing time.  Fingers crossed.    Here's the quote from IRS.GOV:  Stimulus Payments Not Taxable; Reports of Extensive Refund Delays False    The IRS has received a number of recurring questions involving stimulus payments and the recovery rebate credit. Here are some important tips to keep in mind:    Taxability. The economic stimulus payment is not taxable and it should not be reported as income on the 2008 Form 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ.    Refund delays. IRS personnel are aware of reports that errors in claiming the recovery rebate credit could delay tax refunds for as much as eight to 12 weeks. These reports are false. As the IRS detects and corrects return errors concerning the recovery rebate credit, refund delays are currently no longer than about one week.    Peace and good luck getting it soon!  The Reverend
nsaejjnMaa	Just buy plastic that you put on the windows. It creates an air tight seal and will really reduce your heating bills. Put it on all your windows. All you need is a hair dryer and maybe an hour to put them up. (depending on how many windows you have.)    Best of luck!|`|joZFuLEwaa	Well what I would do a few months in advance before you lease is up is approach your landlord.  Mention that your heating bill is always sky high.  Let him know how much you enjoy living in this unit but are considering moving to a place that has more economical heating bills.  Then ask him if he has ever thought of replacing the windows.  See what he says.  Good Luck Realtor Tina in CT|`|8yQYmxVOaa	Agree with the plastic as that is what I do and own the home. You can request but also realize that if he does replace them you rent will most likely go up to cover the costs.
