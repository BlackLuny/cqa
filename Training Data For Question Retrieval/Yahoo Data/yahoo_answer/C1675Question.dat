20090131102332AAY2Twe	Travel;Asia Pacific;Philippines	Mother's death or daughter's birth?	What would you do?  My daughter was recently in a local hospital here in Cebu and I ran into a young man with a strange problem.  His mother was in the hospital, dying of a heart related illness and his wife was giving birth to their first child at the same time.  His mother was fully conscious at the time all of this was going on and told him he should watch his child being born as it was a once in a lifetime event and anything could go wrong.  He talked to his wife and they decided that he should be with his mother as this would also be a once in a lifetime event.  He decided that it was his last time with his mother, but he really wanted to watch the birth of his child, so he weighed his options and made the decision to be with his mother.  This is unusual here in our area, but he did have proper clearance to be in the delivery room because he is a health professional.  In the end, he did say he was glad his wife had no complications because if there were, he would never be able to forgive himself for not being there for her.    My question is, what would you have done if you were in this situation?    It would have been a hard decision for me to make and I am wondering if it would be for you as well.

20090131125307AArVuaI	Travel;Mexico;Cancun	We found 2 kittens in Cancun, Mexico ?	PLEASE READ THIS FIRST IT IS VERY IMPORTANT !!!    When I went to Cancun , Mexico I heard meow-ing in the bushes the first day I was there , (i was staying for 2 weeks ) i looked there and I saw kittens , i decided to leave them alone , there mom had to be somewhere around.    But I heard the same meow-ing in the bushes for 4 straight days , so i finally said "let me just check them out to see if there ok " so i picked them up and they were so skinny ! I could see there ribs !     So i was so sad because well , i'm a sucker for animals , and they were so small and hungry , one was a boy and the other was a girl , then i remembered that I had a blanket in my bag (i was heading for the beach ) so i put the blanket in the bushes and put the kittens on it , where they couldn't be seen. And I went out and bought some fish, chicken , corn beef , and water . They looked to be at least 2 months old . And when I gave it to them , uh , they ate and drank so fast ! They ate everything ! when they were done there stomachs looked like tennis balls .     After that they trusted me , they let me touch them , and they purred when I did it too . Then they took a nap . 2 hours later i went to check on them , they were up and hungry again , so i bought them what they ate last time , except while i was at the store I bought them some toys too . After they ate I played with them . I did this every 2 hours , except for at nights .     I have been doing this for the past 2 weeks and I have to leave Cancun in 2 days ! I don't want to leave them , i've become so attached to them ! And when I'm gone , who will feed them ? Play with them ? And pet them ?  (there not so skinny anymore by the way) I don't know what to do !    And then they will notice that i'm gone , and they will never trust humans again because of what i've done ! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME !!!!

20090131114729AAx9Zzg	Travel;United States;Honolulu	Using an experience or example of when you were close to the beach, or on a cliff, in a house, in a hotel room?	In a lighthouse that is 120 feet high, a person sees a ship on the horizon. Due to the curvature of the earth, how far is the ship from the lighthouse? Use the formula: d = ?[3h/2]        where d is the distance in miles and h is the height in feet.             Therefore, if h = 120,             d = ?[3(120)/2]            d = ?[3(60)]            d = ?[180]            d = ?[(36)(5)]            d = 6?[5]                     d ? 6(2.2361)            d ? 13.4 miles            Using an experience or example of when you were close to the beach, or on a cliff, in a house, in a hotel room, etc., estimate how high above sea level you were and solve to see how far out you would be able to see a boat.

20090131140437AAmDP4n	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Need help planning my road trip?	My dad and I are driving from northwestern Pennsylvania to the Pacific Northwest and back this summer and are looking for places/things to see.  We already plan to see the obvious places like Badlands, Mt. Rushmore, Devils Tower, Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, Glacier NP, Seattle, Oregon Coast, Redwoods and Rocky Mountain NP.  What are some of the lesser known places (state parks, national parks, or anything that's just plain weird) and good scenic routes that aren't to far out of the way?  Also, we have about 3 to 3 1/2 weeks, give or take, to do this trip so we are trying to save as much time as possible.  Is it better to start the trip with a lot of driving (I-80 west towards Denver, then to redwood, head up the coast towards seattle, then take I-90 as the major route heading back, stopping at glacier, yellowstone and badlands) or should we go the opposite way (I-90 to badlands, to yellowstone, and so on) and put the pedal to the metal coming home?  Is there really a difference between the two interstates? Is one more pleasant to drive than another? Does one have more of a 'going out west' type of feel than another?  Or are they generally about the same?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
