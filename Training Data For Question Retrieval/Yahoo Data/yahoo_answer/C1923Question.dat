20090202195056AA90wdt	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	Home surveillance...what would work for us...?	Last weekend while bringing groceries into our condo, I had left our groceries right in front of our door.  We share a hallway with 3 other people.  I naturally bring the groceries in a few bags at a time.  When I came back into the hallway I noticed my only plastic bag missing (which was all meat...really expensive steaks!) and a gallon of milk gone. One of my bastard neighbors took it!  I knocked on each door and only the old woman next to me answered.  I don't 'not' suspect her but...you never know.  She didn't hear any noises or anything.    So my husband is dead set on getting surveillance and security now because he really doesn't trust our neighbors.  He thinks wireless cameras and a touch pad system.    We cannot move right now...    what types of security worked best for you? prices? suggestions?

Ok, I got the 80 GB PS3 so I wanted to buy some games for it but when I looked in the back of the games, it said "Minimum space required: 3.1GB, or 4000MB" WTF?   What does that mean, do I have to Install the games?      I mean if that were true I could only play less than 20 games, not counting the movies, music, pictures or game demos.

20090202233134AAFhSpW	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PC	Warhammer Gaming PC - $400-450 (Question)?	Mainly I wanted to know if this is all going to work together . . . I'm new to building PCs and wanted one that's going to run Warhammer fairly smooth, since my computer is 7 years old and both the CPU / GPU fail to meet the requirements.  I'd just rather start off new rather than upgrading. So, without further ado . . . I present to you my wish list! lol  thanks in advanced, your time and assistance is greatly appreciated.      Case:    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    PSU:    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    CPU:    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    GPU:    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    MOBO:    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    RAM:    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    OS:    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    HDD:    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    Optical:    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...        If I forgot anything please let me know, I have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.  I will not be OCing this PC.  This computer is based purely on running Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning.        Warhammer Requirements (Minimum I believe):      For Windows VISTA      · 2.5 GHz P4 processor or equivalent   · 2 Gigabyte RAM   · A 128 MB Video Card, with support for Pixel Shader 2.0   · At least 15 GB of hard drive space      Supported Video Cards      ATI Radeon(TM) series      · 9500, 9600, 9800   · X300, X600, X700, X800, X850   · X1300, X1600, X1800, X1900, X1950   · 2400, 2600, 2900,   · 3650, 3850, 3870   · 4850, 4870      NVIDIA GeForce series      · FX 5900, FX 5950   · 6600, 6800,   · 7600, 7800, 7900, 7950   · 8400, 8500, 8600, 8800   · 9400, 9500, 9600, 9800   · GTX 260, GTX 280      Intel(R) Extreme Graphics      · GMA X4500      Laptop versions of these chipsets may work, but may run comparatively slowly. Standalone cards that are installed in vanilla PCI slots (not PCIe or PCIx or AGP), such as some GeForce FX variants, will perform poorly. Integrated chipsets such as the ATI Xpress and the NVIDIA TurboCache variants will have low settings selected, but should run satisfactorily.      Please note that attempting to play the game using video hardware that isn’t listed above may result in reduced performance, graphical issues or cause the game to not run at all.      The NVIDIA GeForce FX series is unsupported under Vista.       ---------------------      Should this run Warhammer at decent FPS?  (High graphic settings are not a big concern) . . .       Once again, thank you, and all answers are welcomed and appreciated, as well as any recommendations to changes I should make to run this game as smooth as possible, while staying within the low-budget range.  I'm ordering the computer regardless in 2 days, so please give me some reassurance that everything is going to be okay!  Thanks!!!!!!!

20090203000613AAEAqWz	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	File Sharing on the xbox 360?	I cant get file sharing to work on my xbox 360. My computer can detect the xbox 360, but I think its the 360 that cant detect my computer. Obviously I have a router, but can it be the settings on my router, cause I have no filtering, or vista, but no firewall :( One thing I found odd is I cant get  "Network Discovery" to "On", it stays at "Custom" :S another thing funny is my subnet according to WAN on my router says 255.255.240, whereas my computers is 255.255.255. Also says the ip is 216.x.x. as my computer is 192.x.x. I think this might be the problem. I try to use Media Player 11 with sharing and it always says sharing is disabled, enable it but does not give me a xbox 360 emblem, instead a computer emblem stating "Other users of this computer". Could it be the subnet mask? If so, how can I change it?   if you need ipconfig /all just ask and ill see if i can post it

I broke my phone and using a really bad phone right now, but it's not time to get an upgrade yet. I tried getting a phone at the AT&T store, at full price without the commitment, just the phone. They said I needed the account holder to purchase the phone. I don't understnad why they need the account holder. I thought about getting the phone i want from walmart, it is cheapest getting it online. All I want to do it buy the phone, and put my SIKM card into from the phone I'm using now. But to activiate the phone, don't I need to go through at&t for them to activate it? and they will need the account holder for that? So I am guessing there's no way around it . Please help.

I want to buy my first mp3 player but I just spent the last 4 hours browsing sites online (cnet etc.) and am still feeling overwhelmed and clueless. so I was hoping someone could help me find what I'm looking for or make a good suggestion.    essentially, the features I'm looking for are:  1) Radio tuner  2) Can record audio directly onto it. (I play music and it would be good to have something onto which I can make quick recordings.)  3) Good battery life.  4) at least 20 gig.  5) Ideally, under 250 dollars.  6) good customer support    These are features which I'd want, but if you have a really good recommendation which doesn't have all the above, then please tell me about it.     *It need not play video or image files.*   I don't intend to watch videos on it.     thanks so much for your help!

I have a 1GB SD in my dying mp3 player, so I could use that if one was expandable and a 1GB minimum.      I need over 1GB memory...probably 2GB would be the best. Either a 1GB expandable or a 2GB internal. Please do NOT suggest IPods.      The max I'll spend is about $100, but I really don't want to spend that much.       I'm looking at either the Creative Zens, Zen Plus, Zen V and V Plus). Also looking at Sandisk Sansa (2GB).  And also a Memorex MMP8564 w/ SD expansion slot, it's apparently water resistant. No radio, but the thing is $30 and has expansion. The expensive ones don't even have expansion...what kind of junk is that?  I also want something I can use NIMH rechargeable Double-A's or Triple-A's in...no built-in batteries. Gotta have good sound quality...that's the whole point. Suggestions?

I am just starting out but I don't want a camera that I will outgrown quickly. I have been checking out the Cannon XSI and the Nikon D80. I used a Nikon slr film camera for a few year a liked it but I know that Digital is a whole new ball game. I was wondering if anyone has used either of these cameras or if you have any recommendations. I'm going to be using the camera daily for recreational use..taking pics of my daughter, family, and wildlife.  Budget for a new camera is about $800.00. Also, do you have any recommended editing software.
