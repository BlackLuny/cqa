I have this hard green "deposit" in the bathtub (presumably because of the water drops constantly falling down from leaky tap above, but I dunno by now). I have tried cleaning it using various cleaners and both sponges and brush to no avail - there are like these scattered drops of green and surface around them is kinda scratchy. Another thing is that this is on a bathtub slope so I have no idea how to use all these cleaners that suggest "spay and leave for 3 minutes" - they all just stream down. Any ideas?

20090225093908AAVhbXk	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Can you help me with some landscaping advice please? My back lot is about 3/4 acre, it is a rolling open area?	There is an 3 ft. elevated area against one of the property lines where there is a very large shade tree (Maple). That is the patio area. I love the openness of the land, makes mowing and maintaining a breeze. My problem is I'd like to plant a grape arbor and don't want it to look like a gian structure in the middle of an open space. The land is rectangular, against one long side of the rectangle is my home and the raised patio area, the opposite long side borders the road and is lined with newly planted flowering pear tree's. On the back narrow border is a barn and chicken coop. That border stretches from the raised area to the tree lined street. The narrow border opposite goes from a double wide driveway (lined with blueberry bushes) to the tree lined street.   How can I add an arbor without it looking out of place in an open lawn?

I am having problems with light bulbs continually burning out.  5 years ago I had this problem as well.   The  electric company replaced a transformer, the problem had been fixed and the bulbs had a normal life span.  Now I have the problem again.  I called the electric company recently but they told me before they put a meter to check my electricity I need to call an electrician to make sure there is nothing wrong with the wiring in my house.  I just wanted to get input from anyone who can give my advice.  Another problem I noticed is a ceiling fan in the family room now runs really slow (it's only 6 months old) like its not getting enough amps. Any advice on what to do?  I was thinking of getting some kind of amp/ voltage device from home depot but not sure what to look for.

I checked my breath and it doesn't stink.  I even dropped down the blind in case my walking around the office would keep them from landing on the feeder.        Would it be that the window reflects too much light?      Thanks for your input.

20090225101042AAjxsFW	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	How difficult is it for a non-plumber to replace the filters & membranes on a 4-stage R/O water filter system?	This is a Challenger brand reverse osmosis (R/O) system; Model "Conqueror II".  I bought the 3 required filters and membrane myself but the company who sold us the filtration system wants to charge a high fee to come service it and if they can't make money off the near 100% mark-up on filters and membranes they supply, they'll charge me extra for using my own replacement supplies.  Can we say "con-artist"?  (NO!  Not in the Water business!!)      While I'm an able bodied, intelligent adult male who can do many home repairs myself, I'm not a plumber and some of this requires crouching under the sink, working with special wrenches in precarious places.  I've had one general appliance repairman say he THINKS he can replace these 3 filters and 1 membrane/bladder...but now I'm thinking I might be able to do it myself.        But I wanted to double check with the Yahoo! Answers community first to see if there are any do-it-yourselfers out there or R/O Water Filtration specialists who could advise as to whether I should attempt this on my own.      I've searched online for the instructions to replace the filters and membrane for this make and model, but have yet to discover the magic site.      Any advice?
