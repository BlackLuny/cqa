20090307175213AAX1SBo	Environment;Green Living	Has anyone heard of a solar system that combines photovoltaics and heating water?	I was thinking that if a system could both concentrate sunlight to get more voltage out of solar cells and in order to cool them, run water through the system. This way a building could get both electricity and heat with one system.
20090307181119AAIWiJK	Environment;Green Living	Isn't there the technology of safely disposing plastic into nature?	for those plastics that are no more recycleable. After all plastic molecules are sized in the range of microns and contain nothing else but Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen , Nitrogen and some soft metals at the most.       There is so much talk about nano-technology, then why are the governments choking the watermasses (oceans) with plastics and why the **** are the environmentalists after humanity to get rid of such a useful material?

20090307184154AAEWIEx	Environment;Green Living	How/what can I do to make people aware/care about the environment?	At my part time job, I work with complete, pardon my french, assholes who won't recycle their boxes. When I ask them to give me their boxes so I can break them down, they won't even give them to me. I work in a grocery store, so of course you know we use a fair amount of boxes a day. The produce department is the worst. It alone uses anywhere from 150-400 boxes a day, and they're all being thrown out. They say stuff like "**** the earth!" and "I think everyone who cares about the environment should go to hell!" It makes me angry. I want to do something that will get them to see how much we really should care, or at least make them aware of what they are doing is wrong, and hopefully, after some time, some of them will change what they're doing. I've talked to the manager and they tell them they should recycle the boxes, but he doesnt really inforce it, so I don't think telling the managers/ store managers (I've talked to them too, they've done nothing) will do anything. So does anyone have any creative ways to show them that we need to do something to help climate change?   :( I hate to see that even the places that I work at won't do anything about recycling. We only recycle cardboard. We use SO much plastic containers that could be recycled, and we don't. The fact that they don't strictly inforce the recycling of cardboard drives me insane. I understand that breaking down that many boxes a day is kind time-consuming, but when you dont have much work to do, and you dont have to deal with customers, shouldnt it be mandatory? I have to deal with customers, do my job, I only work 4 hours a day, and i still manage to find time to finish my job, help customers, break down my cardboard AND produce cardboard (depending whos in that night, and if they'll give it to me or not).      Help anyone?

20090307210252AAzq7nT	Environment;Alternative Fuel Vehicles	Rather than screwing around with basically unproven electric cars, why doesn't Detroit go nuclear?	Now that it seems the automakers will end up in receivership at least, why don't we skip the stupid electric hybrid nonsense and build nuclear-powered vehicles? I'm dead serious - it would easy to drop a miniature uranium hydride reactor in a passenger vehicle. Ford had the nuclear-powered Nucleon concept all the way back in the 1950's.      Let the Japanese, Chinese, and Germans mess around with batteries and plug-ins. Let them build go-karts that can travel 200 miles without charging up - we'll have 500-horsepower Escalades that can go a million miles without refueling or emitting a single ounce of carbon, and which would be vastly safer than riding around with 20 gallons of uber-flammable gasoline in a steel tank a few inches off the ground. Just imagine what that would to revitalize American industry and the economy!      So, do you agree? Is is time to get serious and start building nuke-powered vehicles?
