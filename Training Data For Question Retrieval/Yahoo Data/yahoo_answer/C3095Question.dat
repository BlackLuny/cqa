20090226101704AANz065	Local Businesses;United Kingdom;London	CV HELP!: What 'achievements' can I extract from cinema retail work?	Hello,   I need some major help in putting across my 'colourful' CV, after uni (2006) I had temped for a while since 2007-2008 (call centre, then receptionist roles), afterward I went onto a cinema staff job, as it was only supposed to be a stop-gap job as having A job is better than NO job right? (ironically ended up there for 9 months instead of 3!), anyway, it got a bit ridiculous (not to mention pay-wise ridiculous, & it was a job that led nowhere for me)..so I left, with enough savings to see me through till a new temp assignment (so i thought, as my previous agency was so successful for me...then the credit crisis happened!). Anyway, I resigned last Aug and been job hunting since.      So far I am not having much luck getting ANYWHERE, and I have applied to many places :( ...so...I know one weak spot on my CV is trying to state achievments related to my cinema work..   Involved was: multi-tasking, cash handling (& attention to detail), enquiry handling, phone/ticket sales procsessing, queue managing, other customer service blarb, maintaining cinema's overall tidyness and food stock including displays, prompt screen cleaning & co-managing these with colleagues.      At the moment I'v tried putting my jobs down as concise as possible..but I don't think its doing any favours, as perhaps ppl dont get how its relevant to anything? So how can I extract relevant things from that list?? (I had no management roles, not any real supervisory role as I was just basic staff).      The jobs I want now are: Office assistant or library/information assistant work.      THANK YOU
