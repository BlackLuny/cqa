20090205134955AASvJWD	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Agree / disagree?: NW Indiana Times columnist (P. Seat) on George W. Bush's "greatness"?	Please read and react this posted Guest Op-Ed for the NW Indiana Times (Lake County, IN) - - online edition      "Whether in the Oval Office, aboard Air Force One or at the president's Crawford, Texas, ranch, I saw a man that embodied his Secret Service code name, Trailblazer. He tackled the biggest issues of the day, without regard for how it would shape popularity polls. He was a man not burdened by his position, but an ordinary man, with an extraordinary job, focused on doing what was best for our country.      These analysis pieces balance every ounce of the president's accomplishments with a pound of selective reporting chosen to fit their predetermined narrative. While I enjoy fiction, most of the pieces are worthy of staged readings at the Laugh Factory.      Allow me to disabuse you of the popular fairytale that the entire world hates us. In nearly each one of the 23 countries on five continents that I visited with our nation's 43rd president, we were greeted by cheering crowds. Of course, you only saw this when inaccurate rumors swirled that a local had nabbed the president's wristwatch in Albania.      President Bush kept us safe, brought accountability to our schools, prescription drugs to seniors and helped liberate 50 million people from tyranny. Our relations with China, India, South Korea and Japan have never been stronger.      Congress approved and dispersed the largest aid package to combat a single disease in history with the president's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. We have free trade agreements with 14 countries, compared to three when President Bush took office, and he cut the number of nuclear weapons in half five years ahead of schedule.      At home, the president presided over 52 months of uninterrupted job growth -- the longest sustained growth in our Nation's history.? What about those "rich Americans," the ones that liberals claim got the biggest breaks from the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts? They actually pay a greater share of the income tax burden today than they did when President Bush took office. Take that!      This is in no way a comprehensive list of President Bush's accomplishments, but it definitely paints a different picture than the one perpetuated by media outlets intent on convincing you that he was a failure.      So, how would I respond to Colbert? All kidding aside, George W. Bush was surely a great president. If you do not believe me now, we should talk in a few years."      Pete Seat, a Schererville native, ?is former deputy assistant press secretary to President George W. Bush. His column will appear in this spot every other Thursday.

Caylee was last seen July 16th    George Anthony demanded to look in Caseys trunk (and found the gas cans) on June 24th but never mentioned an odor.  So where was Caylees body at that point?    Then she abandons the car on the 27th so that smell had to have developed between the 24th & the 27th.    As far as the pizza or ham & cheese idea, Caseys boyfriend DID say that she had bags of food with her on the 27th so realistically she could have left ham & cheese in there & by July 15th the odor could have gotten really bad HOWEVER . . .     She sent Amy Huizenga text messages prior to abandoning her car talking about the odor.  Do you know what DATE that was?  I think it was the 26th.  And if she was perplexed by this odor, would she not have searched her car & found the ham & cheese?  Or the pizza?    So what do you really think happened?    Could Caylees body have been somewhere else already decomposing and then AFTER the 24th, she put her in the car & was complaining about the smell by the 26th?  Could that smell have happened in that small time frame?    I understand she then went on the squirrel rant so shes obviously lying but the time line & the smell confuses me.    Any theories?

You have got to be lucky to make $4 Billion killing on a 6-month investment of $124 Million Larry Silverstein is the New York property tycoon who purchased the entire WTC complex just 6 months prior to the 9/11 attacks. That was the first time in its 33-year history the complex had EVER changed ownership. Mr.     Silversteins first order of business as the new owner was to change the company responsible for the security of the complex. The new security company he hired was Securacom (now Stratasec). George W. Bush's brother, Marvin Bush, was on its board of directors, and Marvins cousin, Wirt Walker III, was its CEO. According to public records, not only did Securacom provide electronic security for the World Trade Center, it also covered Dulles International Airport and United Airlines, two key players in the 9/11 attacks.    The company was backed by an investment firm, the Kuwait-American Corp., also linked for many years to the Bush family. KuwAm has been linked to the Bush family financially since the Gulf War. One of its principals and a member of the Kuwaiti royal family, Mishal Yousef Saud al Sabah, served on the board of Stratesec.    Follow the money.

20090205101640AApV96r	News & Events;Current Events	What do you think of this? Is President Barack Obama being idealistic or is there hope this could work?	Washington, Feb 5 (IANS) Noting that no religion, be it Christianity, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism, teaches hatred, President Barack Obama Thursday said he will reach out to world leaders to foster a more productive and peaceful dialogue on faith.      'No matter what we choose to believe, let us remember that there is no religion whose central tenet is hate,' he said during a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast. 'There is no God who condones taking the life of an innocent human being. This much we know.'      'We know too that whatever our differences, there is one law that binds all great religions together. Jesus told us to 'love thy neighbour as thyself'. The Torah commands, 'That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow.'      'In Islam, there is a hadith that reads 'None of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself'.      'And the same is true for Buddhists and Hindus; for followers of Confucius and for humanists,' Obama said.      'It is, of course, the Golden Rule - the call to love one another; to understand one another; to treat with dignity and respect those with whom we share a brief moment on this earth.'      Obama said Washington 'will also reach out to leaders and scholars around the world to foster a more productive and peaceful dialogue on faith. I don't expect divisions to disappear overnight, nor do I believe that long-held views and conflicts will suddenly vanish.'      'But I do believe that if we can talk to one another openly and honestly, then perhaps old rifts will start to mend and new partnerships will begin to emerge.'      'In a world that grows smaller by the day, perhaps we can begin to crowd out the destructive forces of zealotry and make room for the healing power of understanding,' he said.      Besides Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, a tradition started by President Dwight Eisenhower, was attended by national and foreign dignitaries, including former British prime minister Tony Blair.

Hey as long as he's not doing anything else, then its ok if he lets loose on occasion. But since he is supposed to be a positive role model for kids, that idiot who released the photo should be punched in the head and knock some sense into him; hey, we are all human with pressures in life, so let Michael enjoy his time off from the spotlight.

If our country is in such bad shape (so they tell me) would it be a good idea to move out of the country? The US isn't going to turn into a 3rd world country is it? The president says we could fall into a recession that might be irreversible.....forever?? My husband and I haven't been hurt by the economy....we both have great jobs and job security. In fact my husband got a promotion and hefty raise the day the banks bombed. If we had the option to leave for Canada or South Pacific countries...should we?  I don't know why people think we're in such bad shape. I don't think we're at all anything like how it was in the 30's during the Great Depression...not even close.
