Your motherboard is the most important factor when considering upgrades, for example can it support dual/quad core CPUs, how much RAM does it support, what expansion slots does it have, AGP,PCI,PCIE, all these factors play a part when upgrading. If your P.C is getting on a bit then i would think you will need to upgrade your motherboard and if that's the case your gonna end up building a new P.C. A good motherboard is the heart of a P.C, find out what one you currently have and see what it supports thats your first step.

0AqkCOWIaa	The Canon G-10 isn't a professional camera.<br>  <br>  It is not the world's best camera. It's a good point and shoot camera, but it's still just a point and shoot camera. <br>  <br>  Yes, it does have Full Automatic controls. Why wouldn't it? The Professional 1d Mark III does as well, and it's thousands more expensive.|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	ALL point and shoot cameras have an Auto shooting mode (that's why they call them point & shoot cameras) and some also have the inclusion of full manual controls (aperture & shutter priority modes). <br>  <br>  The G10 is a point & shoot camera, that also has full manual controls. The only real advantage it has over similar cameras, is that it can also shoot in RAW.<br>  <br>  But, at the end of the day...it's no better than most other point & shoot cameras because it has a teeny tiny sensor (small sensor = poor ISO capability, high noise).|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	If you buy such a great compact and decide to stick it to auto mode, I suggest you get one of those waterproof, fallproof, shockproof, freeze-proof, crush proof Olympus cameras.

7lmfkZgfaa	I agree with Milk84, you can just leave the timer on there. And yes, he most likely WILL get upset and very agitated, but it's the best if you care for him that much. I'm ashamed to even admit that, I too, used to be like this when I was younger lol. My parents took my video games away due to bad grades. Yes, I was pissed but overtime I just got over it. hell, my grades got a lot better haha. <br>  <br>  What you can do is let him play for, say, three hours? or such? usually games take some time to beat or play. Usually by then, he should already get his fill. Then when that timer goes up, you can have some kind of planned activity, like go to the mall, movie, get something to eat, anything else he may enjoy besides video games. lol, it all may sound cheesy but it seems to be the sure way of easing off his gaming time AND helping him get over it.<br>  <br>  At the time, it just took awhile for me to realize that video games isn't everything. I still play a lot, but i'm just glad I realized that at an early age :)|`|05e016606880eeb17bb38e2e4396e1e5aa	My little brother has the same problem. Take it away, let him think for a bit.

ghlZwYPEaa	To make friends you need to exchange wii numbers. I think that you get people on your mii parade by playing wiht them online in a game like mario kart or by being friends w/ them but you need to have internet.. You can also put your own miis in the mii parade. You dont need to buy the wii gun first to play house of dead it is only optional. Super mario galaxy is not compatible w/ the classic controller. But some games that are are Super smash brothers brawl, mario kart or any wii virtual console game. It is recommended that you get a GCN controller instead because then you can play gamecube games and almost any game that you can get from the wii shop channel. Also it has a netter feel to it.|`|oZgDxBTGaa	For making friends, just ask your RL friends' Friend Code (a 12 digit number used to play games online).

xwSNEYICaa	As far as I know, from research I have done, you can move your person from DS to Wii.  It does not remove it from the DS, just imports the person and their catalog (it does not transfer bells or items in your pocket, so put those in the bank before transferring).  So your friend would be able to upload her character from her DS to your  Wii game, and/or upload her character from her DS to her Wii game, then play with you via Wii WiFi.  <br>  <br>  So, she can upload her person to your town, and still will be able to play her person on her DS afterwards.

kgTPnjhkaa	First you'll need a compatible wireless router that can be found by going to the following site: <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendowifi.com/</a><br>  <br>  From there, select your country, which will then take you to the WiFi index page. On this page, mouse over TECH SUPPORT at the top and from the menu that drops down, click on ROUTER INFO. Near the top of the following page, under the words "I don't own a wireless router, help me find one!" there is a "click here" link, which will finally take you to Nintendo's wireless router rating page, which you can look through to either see if your router will work or if you don't have a router, which one to get. For reference, if you live in North America, here is the router rating page.<br>  From the wii home menu...<br>  <br>  Go to Wii Options in the lower left.<br>  <br>  Click on Wii Settings to the right.<br>  <br>  From this first list, click the right arrow.<br>  <br>  Now on page 2, click on Internet.<br>  <br>  Then click Connection Settings.<br>  <br>  From this list, click Connection 1.<br>  <br>  Then, click Wireless Connection...<br>  <br>  and then click Search for an Access Point.<br>  <br>  it will briefly search for any access points and when this screen comes up, click OK.<br>  The following will be a list of nearby access points. If the one you are looking for doesn't show up, click Try again. Then, click the one you have access to...<br>  <br>  When the following screen appears, click OK...<br>  <br>  and OK again.<br>  <br>  it will test the connection...<br>  <br>  And if successful, the following will drop down. Click Yes to update Wii.<br>  Sometimes the above screen is false, saying there is an update when there isn't and the following will appear...<br>  <br>  Now, back in Wii System Settings, click on WiiConnect24.<br>  <br>  From the following list click WiiConnect24.<br>  Click On and then Confirm to save your settings. This feature allows for updates to be seemlessly sent to your Wii so you don't have to do the final step every time.<br>  <br>  Ok, the final step, just as a way to make sure your Wii is up to date. Click the right arrow from the 2nd page of Wii System Settings.<br>  <br>  Click Wii System Update...<br>  <br>  click yes...<br>  <br>  it will test your connection for a few seconds...<br>  <br>  an update screen may quickly come up and tell you there is an update (whether or not your Wii actually needs one)<br>  <br>  and the following screen will appear. Click Wii Menu to finish.<br>  <br>  Now, some of you have gotten different errors and have had problems getting online. I'm guessing many of these hassles come from the fact that hundreds if not thousands of new Wii owners are all trying to, for example, post on the Wii Message Boards and browsing the Wii Shop, looking at and downloading Virtual Console games, all at the same time. In probably a week or so, many of these problems will disappear, so don't worry|`|mYrYYomraa	First, you have to have a wireless router in the house connected to the computer modem. Then, you have to go to the Wii menu and go to settings. Next, go to internet and try to connect it. It should say which system you want to link to, then select your houses.|`|0KSIGekOaa	I believe the best way is Wireless. <br>  Very simple process. <br>  Search for wireless network - then connect. <br>  But then again all networks can be a little tricky and each one is different. <br>  Yours might be especially tricky.|`|5HfuI3MEaa	SSID is name of connecton.|`|ktbyKKK9aa	You need to have a wireless internet connection.

2g5W67Ueaa	no. the blue is only Protector plastic.. you peal it off when you get the phone. i have black. i think it is best because if you get a case for it. the black goes with many more cases than most. i think the maroon color looks weird with cases on it.<br>  <br>  i would say around $200. Give or take becuase there may be deals near you. Don't forget to include the cost of a plan if you have to get one of those too.<br>  <br>  Im not sure.

I think the Maroon is ugly. But, that's my opinion.<br>  <br>  2) Depends on where you get it .<br>  <br>  3) Some stores still have them. Again, depends where you get  it.

Once the device memory reaches a threshold of 800kb or less, LMM will automatically remove data in order of importance to free up device memory.  Once the device has reached full capacity, the device will not be able to store any new data such as SMS text, email, call log entries, etc.  This is a list of the items which may be deleted: <br>  Low Priority: Delete attachment data, browser cache <br>  Medium Priority: Delete old calendar entries <br>  High Priority: Delete oldest e-mail messages<br>  NOTE: Saved messages will not be deleted.  This list is not complete as there may be other items such as SMS text or call log entries which may be deleted.<br>  Cause 2 <br>    <br>  Switching between two applications on the device using ALT+ESC approximately 25 times will cause a memory leak.

RWRhad0oaa	Hi, the exact same thing happened to me, since its not the actual screen you can use it, but cant read much of it since its the touch screen inside has been punctured (that can also happen if you press to hard (like really hard) on the screen). The insurance with the phone covered mine. I got mine from the Car Phone Warehouse and it was ￡30 insurance. I just got mine back today and it was ￡29.99 excess, so its sort of ￡50 anyway. I would definitely recommend taking it to the shop you got it from and getting it fixed, they could fix my phone and didn't have to give me a new one, and they also didn't have to wipe it so everything is still on it. Mine looks as good as new, there isn't a scratch on it.<br>  However switch it off when its in your bag or on the bus, as the touch screen wont be on and it wont puncture it again, I would also recommend putting it in a case as well when its off, because lg cookies are really delicate. Hope you get it fixed.|`|6YXPHVpBaa	I have The Same Phone, <br>  <br>  Well ￡50 Is Cheap, I Sat On My Phone And It Scratched The Screen, I had To Pay ￡120<br>  <br>  Because its a touch screen you need to get it done proffesionaly,<br>  <br>  do not trust these online phone repairs, my mate done it and they nicked his phone and he never saw the phone again, lucky it wasnt a expensive phone (Nokia 5200) <br>  <br>  ￡50 is the cheapest you will get for quality, <br>  <br>  Thanks <br>  <br>  Ben

s2TYiaC7aa	Have you tried going to the mobile version of various websites?  These tend to be less flash-intensive and more friendly to cell phones. For YouTube, try using the shortcut that came pre-installed on your phone it's in the apps drawer - at the very end) instead of using the browser to go there. The videos may take a little while to load, but they will play, even without flash.

Every company has it's own overrated accessories that look "cool" or "useful", but they aren't that good...<br>  <br>  In my opinion though, I think it fits great depends on you.  It would fit great on people who like to play online a lot.  It doesn't fit very good if you just play games.  So I would say no.  But in some ways, yes.|`|fVJbVkJbaa	If you calibrate the keypad as in the instruction manual, it is very useful. If you don't, however, it WILL NOT work.<br>  <br>  I got mine for free, so I'm not complaining. It's very useful for Internet browsing (another PS3 advantage over XBOX)... and very useful for chatting/sending messages.|`|sFz6v7Ohaa	No. It was actually one of the best accessories for the PS3. Some people may say that the mouse feature is useless. This is because they forgot to calibrate the mouse pad (which said so in the instruction manual).|`|UphoLYGYaa	the keypad is definitely worth it. i dont use the touch pad feature, but it is still good without it.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	I dunno, I don't use the keypad.

uGQZWvGOaa	Bring up a screen where the unit asks you to enter in the parental code. You can either insert a restricted disc, or enter the DVD setup menu and go to "parental control" under custom setup.<br>    <br>  When the screen asks for the code, press the SELECT button, then enter in the code "7444".<br>    <br>  The level adjustment under Parental Control dictates the strictness of the player. The lower the value, the more strict it will be. Either increase the value to lower the restriction, or disable the lock entirely by setting it to "off".<br>    <br>  Once you have made your adjustments, be sure that the DVD tray is empty, and press the RESET button on the front of the Playstation 2. It is imperative the tray is clear of any DVD or game for the unit to save your settings.
0PQdeKzaaa	Hi meme before you actually buy 1 of these phones what you need to do is see if your network provider actually sells this model of phone the reason i say this is because what ive found in the past is my network provider didnt sell the particular phone so i had had major problems getting the settings for mms & internet ! the only way you find out if you can get the settings is go onto the phone makers website & see if you can download the settings from there but then thats not always guaranteed ... hope this helps|`|972OdSIJaa	i think you know the right answer. dont buy. <br>  <br>  no point buying overseas and getting scammed.

I had a standard desktop PC, an Xbox that i already ran an ethernet cable through the floor into the basement for, and a wireless laptop.  So i needed a wireless router with ethernet ports.

Its perfect for my application.  I payed $55 for it.  But im sure you can get a DYNEX router that isn't wireless for less then $50. <br>  <br>  And no, your computer doesn't need to be on when your Xbox is on only as long as you do use a router.  Because the internet goes to your router, then splits off to your computer and you Xbox.  So if your router is on you will have connection to both.  <br>  <br>  I hope i cleared that up for you.  Im really tired right now and probably don't make any sense.  I figured i would try anyway.

HVQFVtelaa	I'm sorry, but it doesn't seem that they had extra remotes made for the accessory market. It also looks like they don't have a support site for speakers like some of their other products. <br>  <br>  It also looks like their main web site is not much of a support site.

I suggest having an electrician do it if you don't know what you are doing.|`|de60565995a7f29e41d87d0421edb32eaa	First off that is a  3 phase motor.  It can be done, but you won't like the cost.

Much more than just a transformer.|`|HVvBZhRkaa	It looks like you are going to install yourself an air conditioner or swamp cooler in your home. If this is the case, you will want to call a licensed electrician to come and install the proper hardware to facilitate your installation. It would be very bad if you attempted this yourself. Your standard electrical wiring and breaker box was not designed for this and will have to be upgraded specifically for your project in order to remain in conformance to current electrical and fire codes.|`|dba82cf5cd4968ddc11ebd0e20d4ae34aa	You need a step-up transformer.|`|1ce0b31352ddac4983f71b8fd4ae3b56aa	You could install a transformer, but your current draw would be somewhat excessive.

OiT5SJM8aa	Is it true that if you charge it when there's still some life, it makes it not last as long?<br>  <br>  Not true, the battery inside is a lithium ion battery which is not affected by the "memory effect". This only apply to Ni-Cad batteries.<br>  <br>  However, you still should wait for it to be empty so you minimize the amount of cycles you go thru ( cycle = discharge + recharge ). The battery will start holding less and less charge as you go thru cycles.<br>  <br>  Tips to maximize how long the battery last:<br>  <br>  1: Turn WiFi off : If left on, it will always try to find a signal and it will use a lot of battery overtime.<br>  <br>  2: Reduce the brightness, reduce the time it take for the Ipod to go to sleep or show the screensaver.<br>  <br>  You can buy a very nice "Juice Pack" at Mophie ( <a href="http://www.mophie.com/collections/ipod-touch-accessories" rel="nofollow">http://www.mophie.com/collections/ipod-t...</a> )<br>  <br>  Mophie really makes the best fitting external battery out there.<br>  <br>  I guess also, if you have any other questions regarding batteries in general, Batteries Plus ( <a href="http://www.batteriesplus.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.batteriesplus.com</a> ) are very helpful.|`|IHHOHsMbaa	Don't touch the screen as much, put the light to low, make sure to make the light turn off as quickly as possible. Keep in mind that videos take up more battery power than music and games take up even more battery power than videos since it needs to output video and sound and is receiving input all at the same time. As far as the charging, you should let the battery completely discharge and then recharge it for the first 3 times or so.|`|HJR5ZCpHaa	Um.. I don't think so..

Certainly here in the UK, it's a very recent addition that you can call the Emergency Services over a VoIP line - and only then if the provider supports it.<br>  <br>  That said, to get broadband here in the UK, you're either on ADSL (which requires a phone line!) or Cable (who offer very cheap phone lines).  If you're thinking of VoIP over mobile / 3G broadband, I wouldn't bother - it's unreliable, and the data usage can be excessive.<br>  <br>  By the time you'd paid for a subscription to an internet provider, a VoIP service, and bought the new hardware (you'd need an ATA or a VoIP handset and a router as a minimum to use VoIP without your PC) you might be financially better off with a good ol' land-line.

XYReu11daa	Of course some cameras take better pictures than others. A lot of cameras are more sensitive to color, and have better color balances than others. This depends on the quality of the camera chip, even if the two cameras have the same megapixels. One way to make your pictures have better color is to get a program like Photoshop to adjust the contrast.|`|HFuI8oVYaa	Some cameras have a setting to set the saturation, or "vividness", of the images. You'll need to wade through your setup menus or manual to see if there is such a setting for your camera. I have a feeling that your camera won't have this setting. <br>  <br>  Often times, poor lighting will make your images look dull.|`|c3b645N5aa	The picture you get from your camera is dependent on two main things.<br>  First is the actual hardware, the sensor in the camera can affect picture quality a good amount. Second is the in camera post processing. what the camera gives you is not necessarily what it sees, unless you're shooting in RAW, you're getting a picture that was edited pretty heavily. Fortunately, you can set the in-camera editing, usually, somewhere in the menu. Look for a setting like Saturation or Contrast.<br>  <br>  If you don't find it there, Photoshop is the next best thing.

tgT5MAO5aa	Its possible your game did glitch. I once had that game glitch on me so  I couldn't complete the main quest so I had to revert to a save that was SEVEN hours behind, talk about pain in the ***. I hope you have a save before your game screwed up, I suggest you make a new save at least every hour because in oblivion, this **** happens. What you need to do is connect to Xbox Live and it will download the updates for you immedietly just by starting up the game and that may work. And yes you can get kicked out of the thieves guild, just steal from another thieves guild member and you can join again. Its also possible that have not completed the quest properly.

p6LgotqRaa	If you've bloomed every tree, and fed every animal, then the only solution left is to do the random quests that people give you. For example, racing both Ida (In Shinshu Field) and Hayate (On the beach of Ryoshima Coast) will get you a massive amount of praise. Blockheads are also a good source, but require patience. Doing these side tasks also gives you a hidden / secret power. (It upgrades your brushes) For instance, ‘blessing’ the stones in back of Queen Himiko’s palace will give you a load of praise and will give you the ‘Rain’ brush power. (To ‘bless’ the stones, just use the bush to link the water to each stone. Do this to every stone individually and then the god will appear once more to grant you another part of his/her power.) Side quests like digging for the water to restore Sei-an city also give you praise. (There are two I can think of off the top of my head, one in the Dragon Palace (The door to the right), and Bingo in Taka Pass. (A little past the Cutter’s house.) That’s it for a brief description. If you need any more help or clarification, let me know.

The SMS is then routed to a UK mobile for the final leg to your message centre.|`|AA12316360	In all liklihood, it is to do with the message centre number, some networks use local ones when sending abroad, ie, if she is sending it, then it uses a US message centre number, and some use the ones abroad, ie she sends, it goes through a british message centre number.  Chances are it is cheaper for Sprint to send via the english number than the US one.<br>  <br>  As Elvira said, she got a new phone, so the chances are a different message centre number will have been used, you can usually specify these in the text message settings, reply paths and that, but it isn't generally a good idea to muck about with these unless you know what you are doing and have a list of all the message centre numbers you will need.  I have had to do this when I used to get second hand phones, since I got contract ones, it is all done at the mobile company.

kgTPnjhkaa	The Wii can output 480i/576i/480p over component but some TVs don't like the lower interlaced resolutions. This has nothing to do with the TV being cheap or anything. My Philips LCD isn't able to display anything lower than 480p when I use component cables for example. <br>  <br>  As said there are games that do not support 480p and thus will switch back to 480i/576i - if your TV can't handle this then the picture will stay black and you will have to use another cable. Many VC games suffer from that since they run in their original resolution. NES games for example run in 240p (PAL resolution is 224p I think). If your TV has problems with 480i/576i it is almost a given that the other resolutions used by VC games will not work as well. <br>  <br>  Sadly also disc releases don't always support 480p. I do have a few games that are not 480p compliant: Metal Slug Anthology, Trauma Centre: Second Opinion, Trauma Centre: New Blood, Harvest Moon: Magical Melody, Heatseeker and Kororinpa. I'm not sure about Mercury Meltdown Revolution and Eledees at the moment.....

AbRfd29Haa	If your player workds with CDs but not DVDs, and you have tried a bunch of discs (which you have), there's an excellent chance that your player's red laser is dead. <br>  <br>  CDs and DVDs look very similar, but they're not. The difference is the size and depth of tiny microscopic pits, used to represent data. When CDs came out, they used an infrared laser at a wavelength of around 780nm. They chose infrared primarily because at the time, it was pretty easy to make long lasting, low power, solid-state infrared lasers, and the wavelength was fine for the size of the pits. <br>  <br>  When DVDs were designed, it was clear that the IR lasers for CDs would not work.. they had to shrink the pit and track size, and that made 780nm too large to read the new discs. So they switched to a red laser at 650nm or so. Early DVD drives used only the red laser, as it worked just fine on CDs, too. But red lasers didn't work on CD-Rs... they use an organic dye rather than real pits to represent data, and the CD-R formulations didn't show up right under the red light. So practically every DVD drive or player has two lasers (or, more likely, a single device with two laser diodes on it). Thus, if the red one dies, no fun with DVDs, but CDs can still work. <br>  <br>  It's unlikely you can get this fixed... DVD models are replaced regularly, and repair fees would be more than the cost of replacement. If it's not too old, check your warrenty.|`|0NVypgGSaa	try cleaning your lens with Qtips very gently.

Ask your local mobile dealer at your nearest market if he will do it.
MKuDawP7aa	Restart. Try restarting your iPhone but if your iPhone is locked up or an application was frozen, you need to cancel the frozen application first before you can restart. To cancel the frozen app, press the home button and hold for about 6 seconds. You should be able to cancel the program that is locked up. Then restart your iPhone. To do this hold the sleep/wake button and wait for a red colored slider to appear. Slide your finger across the slider to turn off your iPhone. Before you turn it back on, wait for at least 10 seconds. To turn your iPhone on, hold the sleep/wake button until you see the Apple logo.<br>  <br>  If recharging or restarting your iPhone doesn't solve your problem try another solution.<br>  <br>  Reset. To do this, hold the sleep/wake button and Home buttons simultaneously for a few seconds. The display will quickly wipe itself and you should see the black background and white Apple logo. Just ignore any other symbols that may appear. It is important that you wait for the Apple Logo before releasing the two buttons. The Apple logo signifies that a reset is well done.<br>  <br>  But then again, if recharging or restarting or resetting your iPhone doesn't solve the problem, you may also try another way.<br>  <br>  Remove. More often than not, your iPhone will not work as you expect, if there is content that is not properly synced. This will require more than a restart... you may need to totally remove the problematic content. You may try to remove certain content such as contacts, calendars, songs, photos, videos, or podcasts. Such content may be causing your iPhone not to sync properly. To do this, connect your iPhone to your computer and go to the iTunes site. Change your sync options for each of the following categories: contacts, podcasts, calendars, etc. Click on the iPhone in the Source list, then select each tab to change what content is synced, and then click apply.<br>  <br>  But if recharging,restarting, resetting or removing content from your iPhone still doesn't solve the problem, try another one.<br>  <br>  Reset Settings. There are two ways to reset the settings of your iPhone. First go to settings and then general, then reset, then reset all settings. This will reset everything but no data or media will be deleted. Second, go to settings, select general, select reset and choose erase all contents and settings. This will unfortunately remove all of your saved files, folders, and content, so do this with caution. You may want to backup all of your content before attempting this. The second way will put your iPhone back to the state when you first bought it. Again, use the second option with care.<br>  <br>  If all the tips mentioned above didn't work... you may try this option.<br>  <br>  Restore. Try restoring iPhone using the latest version of iTunes. Connect iPhone. When it appears in the Source list, click on Restore in the Summary tab. This will also wipe the iPhone and all your information on it.<br>  <br>  There are many ways to troubleshoot your iPhone. If you are still have problems the best advice I can give you now is to go to Apple.com The iPhone troubleshooting section of Apple's main iPhone support site contains a walkthrough for situations like this. They have an enormous amount of information out there for you. This may be the best way for troubleshooting your iPhone.|`|WykeMDVMaa	hold the power and the home button for like 15 secs

xgVe3zQMaa	I don't know how you pay only $5 for a sidekick feature.  You can take off the sidekick feature and put it back on as you please but if you intend to purchase another sidekick in the future then I suggest you leave the sidekick feature on since the price of the sidekick plan has gone up.  Also unless only the sidekick data plan with no minutes, you will not have to pay a termination fee. <br>  <br>  You can still use the sidekick's texting feature on a regular phone.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|cn0ALwwLaa	I believe you do not like the Sidekick Slide because it is widely acknowledged as being the worst, stupidest Sidekick produced. You are not alone in this. What was wrong with it from the start:<br>  <br>  1) It was made by Motorola and not Sharp;<br>  2) As a result, it had a smaller screen;<br>  3) It was officially discontinued after only 6 months because:<br>  4) It was a Sidekick that did not Kick. it Slid.<br>  <br>  I have a Sidekick iD, and it is the best one I have had. Sidekick 3s break a lot, and have same size screen.<br>  <br>  Sidekick LX is actually kinda big but good, and I like the Sidekick 2008 the most.<br>  <br>  I think you are lucky you only pay $5 a month for the Sidekick feature. How you do that, I do not know. I can tell you this: Leave it on, the price has gone up.<br>  <br>  If you did remove the feature to set yourself up for more when you put it back on, you would not be resetting your contract. THis is because Sidekick is a -feature,- not a plan. You can add it and remove it as much as you want. It does not change your minutes plan.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to Downgrade your Sidekick is to go Online and buy a Sidekick iD or whatever sidekick you like best, and use it. I am not joking.<br>  <br>  I will sell you my sidekick for $55 if you really want. The extra $5 will cover shipping. Click on my Profile and E-mail me for pics, or whatever you want to see. PayPal works. Thanks.

1gqrH9Ykaa	Haha, calm down. I've jailbroken my iPod plenty of times. <br>  <br>  I think this happened to me my first time also.<br>  Anyway, If it's absolutely unresponsive, try doing a hard restart first. You do this by holding down the hold/sleep button, and the home button at the same time for about 10 seconds. If it gives you the slide to turn off thing, just ignore it and keep holding down until it completely turns off. Wait a few seconds and see if you can get it to turn back on with the on button.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't work, plug it into your computer and try restoring it. Hopefully there's nothing on the iPod that isn't on your computer.<br>  Let it do it's thing, and hopefully it'll come back to life.<br>  <br>  <br>  The problem in what happened, may be that most software (from what I've seen so far...I haven't looked for any recently) don't support 2.0 firmware.<br>  In the future, you may want to try downgrading your firmware to one of the previous versions (i.e. 1.1.3, 1.1.4, etc.) and try again. I think the jailbreaking software I used when I did it was Ziphone. It worked like a charm, and downgrading would probably be safer anyways.<br>  The higher firmware versions are pretty much useless when they're jailbroken anyways.<br>  <br>  Don't let people think it's broken, because chances are there are ways to get it to snap out of it.<br>  <br>  If this still doesn't work feel free to email me for more assistance. <br>  Hope I helped. :]|`|cQ6UFMmyaa	Plug your ipod into you computer and reset your ipod to factory defaults|`|9wojIiiWaa	theres proly vids of what to do on youtube.. if not then check on the site where you got the jailbreak download on for help|`|Iqjm4zLsaa	You shouldnt have done that.<br>  <br>  Ugh you messed up<br>  Its broken now.
yw13cnDgaa	toothpaste. Now, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but try it. It works, trust me. Okay, now take the scratched CD and put a generous amount of toothpaste on a cotton towel. Take the towel and apply the toothpaste from CENTER-OUTWARDS all the way around, doing one section at a time. Leave to dry. Then, take a dry towel and rub the CD until clean. Hope this helps! xoxo|`|3tp7Hii7aa	Buy a liquid or towelette for CD Cleaning at a local electronics store and rub it down. Helps a lot.

If it's just the glass that got broken, perhaps you can get glass replaced by a local dealer or have it sent out to the manufacturer.  I'tll obviously cost you some loot but it won't be as much to buy another 50", thats for sure.  Good luck!
IoKjLtN9aa	Sounds like hardware failure. <br>  <br>  Because you got it refurbished just call apple and they'll take very good care of you, sorry you had a bad experience with refurbs, I buy refurb computers all the time and have never had a problem! <br>  <br>  They'll send you another one in a heart beat :).
NmzWCCdLaa	Try uninstalling then installing it again. The message you get probably means you are missing part of the software. If re-installing doesnt work check the internet for patches and if that doest work try and take it to a local gameing station for advice.<br>  <br>  Also try typing this problem on a search engine - someone else may have found a solution.

You can change the controls to what you feel is most comfortable.

TBPYrtD1aa	I really have zero idea how or why that happened. I would try turning off the phone for a few minutes and then turning it back on.
