20090202110023AAKS8bA	Arts & Humanities;History	The Amistad Case. How was it a landmark case in the history of America and the World?	The Amistad case was a case regarding enslaved Africans who took over a Cuban vessel. They demanded the captain sail them back to Africa, but the captain instead steered them to America. There, they were seized by an American vessel and jailed. Their trial was difficult, because they didn't speak English, and no one knew where they came from. In the end, the verdict was the the Africans were free and were allowed to be sent back to Africa.      I understand the case, but I don't understand how it is a landmark in America and the World.      Please help me understand?

20090202112248AAIW8eK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this?	Okay so it's kind of long, but I would still really appreciate any opinions or advice given.  I have written much more and I am thinking of publishing it soon since it turned out better than i thought it would.  This is the beginning.  I kind of don't like my first sentence and how I started so i will accept any advice about that.   Thank you =]      “Oh great, I need a new French book.”  I mumbled as I leaved through my copy of Tout Va Bien.  I needed to stop using my ‘power’ on my books, and my clothes, and worksheets.  I simply just couldn’t lie to my parents anymore about me losing all kinds of stuff; they would stop believing me soon.     I knew I was different.  I felt different.  All these things I could do, they weren’t normal, not for a 17 year old at least.  Maybe, for fan fiction books they were awesome.  But not for me, no.  But I was used to them by now.  They didn’t scare me like they did in the beginning, when I first discovered I could make people do anything I wanted them to for instance.    “Give it to me!”  I yelled as Layla, my older sister by one year, stretched her hand in the opposite direction and with the other blocked me for reaching it.  She was holding my pink lip gloss and would not give it back until I apologized for accusing her of stealing it.  But she did.  She had kept it hidden for a week, since the day she borrowed it and then claimed to have given it back to me.     “Not until you say you’re sorry.” she said simply, tilting her head sideways.    I looked at her in the eyes, giving her my most fierce look.  My brows arched together over my golden brown eyes and I said through my teeth “Give.  It.  To.  Me.”     I was shocked when I saw her features unwind and her hand relax.  She passed the lip gloss towards me slowly and put it carefully in my hand.  I looked at it, sitting on my white palm, the glossy liquid flowing around in its container.  Then I looked at her, and blinked.  Wow, my fierce stare is scary after all.  I turned to leave, skipping out the room and said “Thank you” over my shoulder.     “Hey!” she called and reached her hand out to stop me.   “What?”     “Give it back to me!  How- how did you do that?”  She asked, a puzzled look on her face, her brows pulling together in confusion.   “Do what?”     “That.  Make me give it to you.  I didn’t want to, I just did.”   “You’re nuts, L.”  I scoffed and left.      That was the first time.  Many followed that made me wonder what was wrong – or maybe right – with me to make everyone do anything I wanted them to do.  However, I only used this power every once in a while, whenever I was in really big trouble.  Most importantly, I avoided using it on my parents.     Nevertheless, it didn’t always work when I wanted it to.  Every time I did it, I seemed to be missing something, doing something wrong and I just couldn’t figure out what.  I concentrated, and I stared, but it just wouldn’t work.  The other person would just look at me dismissively and insist on saying no.    That wasn’t the only power I had though, and every time I discovered something new, I felt like the hero in a fantasy story and wondered if I was really awake.  I could control fire.  I could start it any time I felt like it, move it around to burn anything I pleased and turn it out anytime I wanted.  The fires started usually when I was angry, or emotionally pressured.   I also had a knack of turning things into ash if I ran my hands on them for some time, therefore I avoided any kind of caressing on animals, or patting on backs.   No one knew about my powers.  I hadn’t told anyone.  Not my parents, and certainly not my sister.  They would call me crazy, and I wouldn’t blame them.  And knowing them as I do, if I tried to prove to them my abilities, they would hang crucifixes around the house, and send me out for an exorcism, even though they weren’t really the God feared kind.

Wally the Amazing Elephant    By, ***** ******* You can't steel it because It's mine and if you do...BEWARE      Wally snuggled into his blanket trying to hide from the roaring wind blowing through the cracks of his crate. He was cold, hungry, tired, and miserable. He missed his mother, who was sold to the San Diego Zoo. But poor Wally had to stay with The Mike and Laura’s Circus.     With a crash, a bang, and a jerk, the train skidded to a halt. Wally heard people yelling, pigs squealing, monkeys screeching, and doors slamming. After an hour or two everything was silent. Wally was confused; he had no idea what had just happened. Even though Wally was so scared, he managed to fall asleep, fast asleep. In fact he was so deep in sleep a bomb could’ve went off and he wouldn’t even have noticed it.     Something soft and fluffy was tickling Wally’s foot. At first he didn’t really notice, but as he gain conciseness, he jumped up and screamed. “Whoa there big guy, don’t squash me!” Yelled a small squeaky voice. “Who said that?” asked Wally shaking all over. “Down here!” came the voice again. Wally looked down, and sitting in front of him was the most peculiar rabbit he had ever laid eyes on. He was wearing a tuxedo shirt complete with a tie, and matching the tie was an orange hat with red polka dots.     “I’m Flea, who are you?” He asked having to look quite a far way up at Wally. “I’m Wally.” answered Wally kind of shocked. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a big black blob swings to the ground next to Flea. It took only a second for Wally to realize it was a chimpanzee.Wally backed away bumping into the wall of the crate. Sorry buddy, thought I should come swing by.” said the chimp. “Uh…What’s your name?” stammered Wally. “It’s Bananas, Wally.” He answered opening the crate door. “How do you know my name?” asked Wally in awe. “Doesn’t really matter does it? Now let’s go!” Bananas yelled picking up Flea and jumping onto Wally’s back. “Where to?” Wally asked stepping forward. “Home, of course!”  Bananas and Flea yelled.   It was getting dark, and there was still no sign of home anywhere. The ground was vast and dried up. “Hey elephant!” called a voice from above Wally. Wally lifted his exhausted head. And saw a crow.  “Um we are trying to find our home!” Wally yelled up to the crow. The crow swooped to the ground and answered “Oh I see, you from the circus?” he asked nodding to the blanket resting on Wally’s back that said “Circus”.  “Yes we are, and what’s your name?” Wally asked looking down at the bird. “It’s Cracker-Jack, but just call me Jack, and I can help you just follow me to the city.” And with that Jack flew into to the air, and Wally followed.     After awhile of endless walking, Wally spotted tall building, and light. When he entered the city people were screaming, cars were stopping, and people were surrounding poor Wally and his friends.      “Stand back people!” yelled a man holding a strange gun. Wally was terrified, and so was Bananas and Flea for they were griping his skin. He was shaking all over. Suddenly there was a loud pop and Wally felt woozy. His vision started to get blurry.  Then everything went black.     Wally was alone, and he was walking, but going nowhere. ‘Where oh where can home be” he wondered. Suddenly everything was black; he was walking through black, but not going anywhere.      “Ahhh!” screamed Wally sitting up. He was drenched in sweat. That was his worst nightmare ever. “Now, now sweetie, I’m right here.” said the most beautiful voice ever to enter Wally’s ears. He turned around to see his beautifully amazing mother sitting in front of him. Now, Wally knew he was home.

20090203163821AAfcJUS	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please Edit! Easy 10 points to the person who gives best advice!!!!!!!?	Can a boy put up with his overprotective mother not letting him do anything fun due to minor cuts and bruises? Well in this gut-busting book he does, at least for a while.    Sam Harris, the story’s humorous eleven year old protagonist, can’t do anything fun like play football (soccer) or walk to school with his friends. Why can’t he? Your head is probably bubbling with curiosity. He can’t do anything fun because his Mother is afraid he’ll get injured. Injuries over walking to school? Like that’s ever going to happen!     Since Sam can’t do anything fun he’s bored, but not for long. Soon the hysterical Griswalds move in next-door and Sam starts having some fun but his mother is still interfering with his play. Even though the Griswalds are fun to play with, they start causing trouble doing reckless things like burning down the bus shelter. While Sam and the Griswalds are busy becoming friends, there are problems around the city involving them. Will they be able to find solutions to all of them or will it be too late? Read this rib tickling book to find out!    Emma Barnes will absorb readers of all ages into this side splitting. The pictures by Tim Archbold are really something to look at. Readers who like humour and adventure will love this really funny book. Both the paperback and hardcover of Sam and the Griswalds which has 320 pages were published in 2004 by Bloomsbury Publishing Co.
20090203163848AAuoiTn	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Poetry, please read/rate/criticize?	I'm not very good at writing poetry, so please rate, and tell me if I should change a word or two. Thanks      "BLACK      Black...   is a colour I ver well know,   it brings us all darkness.   It is also the colour of my soul...   My eyes, blocked by a black shroud.   My head, stuck in a black cloud.   A black fog, corrupting my mind,   walking through a haze, tripping endlessly   trying to find any sign,   a beam of hope, shunned by darkness   Inner light, covered by my heart,   black and stained, tainted by hate,   frienship turns black, and love will also start.   People, only seen as silhouettes.   I'm blind to their face, heart, and love.   Only seeing what I don't get   lost in my own head, having enough.   Tired of hate, tired of pain   running fast, and going nowhere.   Looking in every direction and it's all the same.      With love comes pain, it's only fair.   The ones you love, always to suffer,   nothing you can do, helpless and useless,   hearts filled with pain, faces disappearing.   Wishing we all could just turn to nothingness.   I can only stand and watch them cry,   feeling the weight, and their pain.   I'm only holding onto life, by a lie.   Held in, never letting out.   Emotions kept back, all turning black.   Head coming in, pain..., wishing I could stop,   and let them all go away. Never want them back.   My body crumbles, and my knees stutter.   Body hurting from simple feelings.   Blackened by hurt souls, black in colour.   Black to the floors, walls, and ceilings,   filling the room, hiding the light,   With all this pain...   It is hard ..to win the fight."      please tell me what to make better, feels like I may have lost a bit of topic at one point

Never lost my path but things have corrupted my thoughts so that i cant see the light that shines my way through the darkness, if only I had stayed in my safe place then maybe it wouldn’t be so hard on me, time after time i fall but get back up but this time I’m stuck, I need a hand 2 lead me back cause i know I cant change the past, but oh man how I wish I could. if I could rewind everything and go back 2 the first day and show him how much it hurt, how many tears I’ve shed but it doesn’t change anything he’s gone and I’m here, alone with my heart in the stars, shooting farther and farther away, trying 2 find its way back, but it wont and never will, I’ve felt more than this but it hits harder each time and i know i wont be alright, there’s hope 4 those that believe and then there’s just life 4 the others, no faith no reason 2 go on, that’s where the truth hits u and u realize u never had dreams only wishes of lies 2 keep u alive, so u fall and don’t get up well this is me I’ve never believed and never will so lie all u want it wont change anything.

Melanie Prokop- main character   Laurel Prokop- Melanie's older sister   James Ronan- love interest   Miriam Ronan- James' sister, something of a love-hate relationship with Melanie   David Ronan- James' brother who also loves Melanie, who views him as a friend but nothing more.    Caleb Foley- adopted younger brother of Melanie   Sara Whipple- Melanie's cousin, very close to her   Rosaline Whipple- Mel's aunt, a maternal figure to her      P. S. You'll be pleased to know that, unlike most of the books being written by other 15-year-old girls, this book is startlingly lacking any sort of werewolves, vampires, or related such creatures, and, unlike Twillight, actually has a plot that goes somewhere.

20090202150349AAZkQRp	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Edward Cullen is possessive, controlling, overprotective, bossy, clingy boyfriend who wouldn't be that way if.?	he had a life of his own outside of Bella and their relationship.   Agree or disagree?   I love Twilight and I couldn't wait to read the other books.   SPOILERS FROM NEW MOON AND ON   I read New Moon and I thought Bella was so dramatic how she's going to wonder into the forest and take a nap on the cold, wet, dirty ground because Edward broke up with her. The whole book was basically about her losing her mind and whining about Edward and that got old. I thought New Moon was okay. I liked it a lot, but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would.      I read Eclipse and that's where I started to stop liking the story. Edward is just way to overprotective and it's annoying. Bella wakes up and she and Edward drive to school together. They have practically every class together. They hang out with each other after school when she's not working. He pretends to leave then when she goes upstairs he's waiting in her room so he can watch her sleep. There's nothing romantic about him watching her sleep. that's so weird. I would be freaked out if my boyfriend did that before we even started dating let alone while we were dating. Bella is just whiny, selfish, stupid (she keeps calling herself selfish and stupid for playing with Jacob's heart but she's obviously not that sorry because she won't leave him alone), clingy, whiny, she complains way too much, submissive, a doormat (Edward will not let her see Jacob and even goes so far as to take her engine out of her car. she actually begged him to see him. she's not 9 years old, if she wanted to go she should have. what could he do about it), and she can't breathe for 15 minutes if Edward's gone. Their love was so cute but it started to make me sick and both of their behavior got on my nerves.      And Breaking Dawn was just stupid. I'm not even going to get started. first of all...What the hell is Reneesme?? if that's even how you spell it. why would she do that? then she considers giving the child to her best friend that was in love with her that just had love at first sight with the child and is basically a pedohile and all she thinks about is having sex with Edward. Bella needs to be smacked. hard. twice.      I was so disapointed in the Twlight series. I thought it could have been something great, but I feel like Stephanie Meyer just rushed it. I think she was trying too hard to catch everyone by surprise and she ruined the story.   What do you think?   Do you think Edward would be less-Edwardish if he had a social life?

20090202151823AAoxi52	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Read my poem ant tell me what you think?	Eyes closed, I still see,   Solitude around for miles.   Only this road of infinite sound,   Presses concrete on my face.   Ages pass.   Still happy, sensing joy,    Every time the chimes sing.   It is enough, here I will wait,   Here between day and night,   Here at the third choice.      I feel complete when the sound returns,   Every decade.    No need to go above or below.   The perfect middle.   Nor life nor death.   Only latent thoughts that come at dark,   Remind me that I exist.   How I wish others could see this road.      Just look below a simple dream,   It is always there, always was.   And if you see it, be sure to wait,   For the first sound.   Let it flow, reverberate.   And you shall know your cradle,   You shall see your tomb.   You will return and,   Walk on the road each night.   For it is right,   To know the meaning.    It is right to know the truth.

20090202151936AAsd1wv	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Do you find joy in growing old together?	an hour to compose.      GROWING OLD TOGETHER      Close the shutters lock out the night   Turn up the wick that we may have light.   Put another log on the fire; keep us warm   Now to enfold each other until next morn.        Rest your curled head upon my breast   As we watch the firelight while we rest.   See the patterns the dancing flames shape   Across the oak beams we both did make .      From Oak trees felled on Oakley Moor   We built this cottage with its stout door,   Thatched with reed from waters edge,   Set back windows with their wider ledge.      Where grow the flowers in window box   As Pied Magpie on the pain he knocks.   This night is ours as in the warmth we lie   On the ceiling moving shapes make no cry.      They add only comfort to our little home   From which we have no desire to roam.   Though far off lands called many away   In our own abode we are content to stay.      We have our hens and a good milking cow,   What else we need we will dig and sow   To reap the reward of our own hard labor   With enough to share with a friendly neighbor.      Five acres of freehold land we do own   Each year it is plowed, farrowed and sown.   Wheat and barley saved from our last yield   A portion fed to our cow in yonder top field.       We are not rich with the worlds sought wealth   But we have each other and our good health.   Neither do we stray far from our small village    But benefit by what the land gives after tillage.      All three of our children have flown the nest   Kindley many have said we now can take rest.   But when one has worked  most their long life   Having learned that idle hands can cause  strife.      So we live in quite agreeable contentment,    With few disagreements, even less argument.   Sixty grand years we have now been wedded   Thirty years a bachelor before I was netted.      No complaints with she who's life I share   My life without her I could not bare.   For she is the heart and soul of our home,   There is no desire for me to want to roam.      No woman could please a man more than she,   I am at peace, I am content as she looks at me   As it were but yesterday that we were married   During all past years only once was I worried.      At the church doors she did stop with her father   I trying with all my might to will her in further.   She turned and looked at my anxious face   Then they walked down the isle at a snails pace.      My heart was pounding as I lifted her veil,   While her mothers sniffing turned into a wail.   'That was my most happiest of days' she said,   But all I could think about was home and bed.      Our honeymoon was at crowded  Blackpool.   Her father gave us a good milking stool.   Which we still use after all these past years   As we built up the farm with our sweat and tears.      All of these hard years have taken their toll,    In  past times we would stroll up the knoll   Of the only hill we have on our fertile land,   Now when we go we  hold each others hand.

Tired, despaired father,   Sighing melancholy tones,    Awaiting his,   Inevitable, relentless destiny.      Soot covered young lady,   Clinging onto her husband,   Wishing, hoping, begging,   For his life.      Ruddy cheeks, round brown eyes   As she cries, not understanding,   Desolation, anguish, sorrow,   A lost soul.      Time is running out.

20090202164736AABubkD	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you think I should be an author?	My dad is always saying that I have a lot of talent and that I should become an author one day. What do you think? Here's a little excerpt of what I wrote for my State Writing Assessment (I chose the creative prompt "Lightning Strikes"--so far the main character was teleported in a bolt of lightning):      I lay on the ground with a racing heart beating loud as a thousand bass drums. As I searched around me, however, I found that I had not yet returned home. I found myself in an empty blank hallway, with fizzling fluorescent tracks fixed on the ceiling. The temperature was cool enough that my breath became a visible puff of condensation. I listened to the eerie whispers of my name all round, a chorus of sandpaper hissing against rough tree bark.    “James…James…”    I had to escape; my whole body seized up, poised to sprint away at first chance. The whispers grew louder, a din which erased any hope of a coherent train of thought. The walls melted into a rubbery membrane as a hundred gnarled, large-knuckled hands pushed through, clawing and grabbing at me. I bit and kicked and screamed louder than I ever remember having done, all to no effect. The hands were followed by spindly arms and hunched, bat-like bodies. Their skin was waxy and covered in grime, so repellent that I was tempted to vomit...      PS: I'm in seventh grade right now.

Haven't written in ages so I'm quite rusty, this is my second attempt at writing an opening paragraph. I need people to tell me my mistakes and if this would catch your interest or not.      Blood roared in my ears and ice cold air pierced my lungs. I was being chased by several trained warriors who were all after my blood. I was already running as fast as I could, but the distance between me and the warriors was slowly shortening. I had already abandoned my sword a while back. It was just a dead weight considering I couldn’t fend of five, maybe more, warriors. “Faia!” someone shouted my name from not too far away. Relief swept through my body, but quickly vanished. An arrow flew past my head, missing me by a hair. Panic seeped through my tired body and my knee’s started to buckle underneath me. “Stay strong!” I mentally screamed at myself, pushing myself up and sprinting in the direction of whom ever called my name.

20090202163319AAyAunT	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	This is kindof crazy, i just couldnt stop typing it all now...you dont have to read it all!!?	. I want to see him so much, my heart aches I would embrace the insanity if it would gain me my sight, let me see him again. How desperate this all is, how sad it seems that I cannot accept my mistake, I cannot accept that such happiness was within my grasp and I let it slip, I have fallen into such darkness will I ever find the way out as I sit here, typing with as much dexterity as I can muster to distract myself from seizing the razor before me to cut at more veins. The darkness envelops the soul so quickly when the lights are diminished. All I want to do is be consumed by the flames that lap at my feet and dissolve into the hallucinations before my eyes with the drugs at my hands. I don’t want to see anymore, the world is bleak and the rain falls with heavy regret upon the pane of my window. I don’t want to hear anymore for the music drums and thrashes with heavy beats upon the skin of my kit, and I do not want to feel anymore for the torn state of that skin is so raw and bruised no touch could ever soothe its scars.                       Take me away, take me to the dormant land that is found to sleep, let me linger in its realms and heal through its peace. I don’t want to think. Is it over I ask? It never started though, it was nothing, but who could have thought that nothing would hurt so much and wield so much self destruction. What self destruction? What damage is there really they may ask, or is it mere teenage distraction. There was always damage, there was always a hole present, a black hole which pulled at everything around it with a gravitational force too strong to resist, and every speck of white hope there ever was, was drawn into its vortex of arid colour and forced reluctantly to wind in circles, to remain in its place and appear at its moment within the cycle, hopes moment within the cycle – where aurora’s voice reveals itself and she feels as though she can escape and there is hope yet to run, to flee. You cannot run from your feelings forever, they will always be there to taunt at your memories, what was real – I do not know anymore.    She was always messed up, he said, maybe he is right, everyone always thought I was a mess before I knew myself and will I rise above the pointing fingers and jeering around me – I do not think so, for I would rather sink to the hollows than swim anyway. Swimming gets you nowhere, nowhere other than these circles that will not disintegrate, running is circular too. I cannot escape the circles of my life I should embrace the lines, the straight lines of death that are before me. Everyday is a circle, we get up, live then sleep to then awaken, a line is different, where I only live, never sleep or I only ever sleep to live. Right now I still feel the bitter pangs of pain upon my wrists where the blood oozes and sweet adrenaline floods my heart. Another night welcomes the arrival of insistent/invading insomnia. My head is overwhelmed with thoughts, my heart swells with pain, I can hardly endure the memories of the day as they sweep over me and I recollect another of my wreckless acts which are sure to condemn me to bars one day, as opposed to current misery.
20090202160431AAV33zP	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Trying to remember a book?	I am trying to rememeber this book.   A girl's mother died when she was young. Her father recently remarried to a women with a son. The girl and boy take turns taking trash to the supermarket dumpster or something along that lines. Then she sees an extra dumster and wonders what is was for. She also saw something that looked like a glowing crisp bag, she thinks it was trash. Her father gets annoyed at her for finding this peice of trash.    Then the girl was kidnapped and kept in a room. I remember they took away her glasses and her clothes so she couldn't run away. They gave her sleeping pills and a boy about her age fed her.    She learned that her mother was a magic person from a clanish sort of thing. They lived in a special tree. She learns that she was kidnapped by a perosn who was kicked out of the clan for being bad but wants to make a new one. He needed another magic person to make the clan ( i think the number was 13), so he kidnapped her. He apperently murdered or help to murder the girl's mother.    The trash she had found had been a used spell.   She also had a familiar with a spider. Her clan was still in contact with the girl's father and had in encouraged him to get her a dog to bond with but the father wouldn't. (Her father brought the used spells to the clan).   The evil magic people try and force her to join them, but she refuses.  The main evil man (the father of the boy) had a raven as a familiar...(i think)   She and the boy make a friendship and run away. Her father comes after her with his stepson and his friends (the step son kept getting into bad things during the book). They try and save her.    Eventually the girl gets to visit the tree that was her mother's tree and home.  Her mtoher talks to her in a weird way and says the told her father to marry again through a dream. I think the mother was blind....   that is all i remember   i think it was named spell something   or star something

20090202164734AA5aIyg	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How is the beginning of my story?	I’m finding it hard to sleep tonight; I can’t seem to settle. All I can think about is blood, I close my eyes and I picture a razor gashing across someone’s wrist, and I watch as the cut gets so deep a vein bursts. And all that beautiful shimmering blood pours out, down her arm. It begins to slow down, and then it stops, the arm falls and it doesn’t move. It’s like an overwhelmingly beautiful piece of music being played to you, all these little emotions that you savour. I knew it was time, I had to kill again.    I had already buried about four people in their unmarked graves in the past two months. I normally only kill when I feel a dire need. It’s a precious thing, taking away someone’s life and so I don’t like to do it too often, I don’t want my favourite hobby getting boring on me. Tonight I was having one of those urges; it’s only so long that I can function in society slightly normal before I have the need to kill again.    I reached out under my bed and pulled out my tool bag. Where I keep most of the instruments I use when I head off to do my work. All those little knives I carry are so pretty, they can really create true art, and the body of my poor defenceless victims is my canvas. Just splash that crimson blood around a bit and a masterpiece is born. My favourite is the pen knife, so simple, easy to hide; your victim won’t even see it as you crawl up behind them and slit their throats. Oh so dark, rich, and delightful.                i will add more if i get a good response but i didnt want the question to be too long.

We did not exist beyond the gaze of a boy.      Shaking water off our limbs, we lifted   up from ladder rungs across the fern-cool   lip of rim. Afternoon. Oiled and sated,   we sunbathed, rose and paraded the concrete,      danced to the low beat of "Duke of Earl".   Past cherry colas, hot-dogs, Dreamsicles,   we came to the counter where bees staggered   into root beer cups and drowned. We gobbled      cotton candy torches, sweet as furtive kisses,   shared on benches beneath summer shadows.   Cherry. Elm. Sycamore. We spread our chenille   blankets across grass, pressed radios to our ears,      mouthing the old words, then loosened   thin bikini straps and rubbed baby oil with iodine   across sunburned shoulders, tossing a glance   through the chain link at an improbable world.

20090202161541AAtPVy6	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I really need help analyzing the poem, "On Turning Ten" by Billy Collins. I need to find literary element?	Literary elements such as metaphors, similes, tone, diction, language, etc.          The whole idea of it makes me feel   like I'm coming down with something,   something worse than any stomach ache   or the headaches I get from reading in bad light--   a kind of measles of the spirit,   a mumps of the psyche,   a disfiguring chicken pox of the soul.      You tell me it is too early to be looking back,   but that is because you have forgotten   the perfect simplicity of being one   and the beautiful complexity introduced by two.   But I can lie on my bed and remember every digit.   At four I was an Arabian wizard.   I could make myself invisible   by drinking a glass of milk a certain way.   At seven I was a soldier, at nine a prince.      But now I am mostly at the window   watching the late afternoon light.   Back then it never fell so solemnly   against the side of my tree house,   and my bicycle never leaned against the garage   as it does today,   all the dark blue speed drained out of it.      This is the beginning of sadness, I say to myself,   as I walk through the universe in my sneakers.   It is time to say good-bye to my imaginary friends,   time to turn the first big number.      It seems only yesterday I used to believe   there was nothing under my skin but light.   If you cut me I could shine.   But now when I fall upon the sidewalks of life,   I skin my knees. I bleed.       Thanks

20090202162936AALVhvb	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is this argument logical?	I want to know if this is a logical argument/conclusion. I told someone that I am not surprised that they do not like asparagus because they prefer eating canned vegetables to frozen or fresh vegetables. As asparagus is a slightly more bitter/flavorful vegetable than a more traditional American vegetable like a green bean or a pea, and the person already prefers canned vegetables to fresh ones (canned vegetables having relatively low amounts of flavor) then I concluded that it makes sense that the person did not like asparagus. I realize that this question is stupid, but I just want to know if I was able to make that assertion logically.

I'm in 7th grade advanced language arts, so I need a good sized book without too many big words...thich enough to read in 9 weeks but good enough for me to understand. :) You can read the the rest if you want to, to understand my style if you want:      One time I tried reading "The Uglies" only because everyone was doing it, and it was the boring-est thing ever. It took me 3 months to read 90 pages, and then I quit. On the other hand, my sister read the same book and was latched onto it. (my sister is an avid reader though.)      But, a good book like The Outsiders, Drift House, The Giver, and The 5 People you Meet in Heaven really made me happy. I started reading them and couldn't stop!! Books like that are great!   Could you help me find a book like that? It needs to be pretty thick, like 200-300 or more pages..and definately good.   Do not suggest Harry Potter please...to many thick books...and don't say Twilight I'm already going to read it sooner or later in my life.

20090202164531AAJhcjF	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	What is the best way to go about choreographing a dance?	I like to dance to hip-hop and I'm getting into making choreography, but what's the best way to go about it? Should I listen to the music and just do whatever comes to mind? Should I listen to each line one at a time over and over again and slowly create the steps based on the beats? Is there a universal way on how to choreograph a dance?      I find that doing whatever comes to mind while the music playing isn't good for me because almost a second later I may forget the move I just did and all purpose has been lost.      I'm currently using the second method I mentioned: listening to one line after another, making up the choreography for each line. However, I sort of find this a bit tedious...      I'm just really confused. Is there a better way to do this?   And also, what's the eight-count method? I know that music plays in counts of eights and that you could assign each count to a set of dance steps but I don't even know how to count it... I mean I know how to count to eight, but how fast do I go? At what point of the song should I go up to eight? It's just so confusing to me and I can't seem to find a well-detailed explanation on how to use the eight-count.      But even with the eight-count what's the best method to choreograph things? That's my main purpose here.      Thank you =]

In Madness Suffered   In madness suffered,   Of wickedness foretold,   With evil’s justice implored,   I’ve been there, where,   No lower place to hide,   But for the face of condemnation,   As we know; we took to seed.      All fantasy notwithstanding,   There was not, nor shall there ever be   A realm so vast, so hypnotic, so personal,    A vacuous essence as irrational as time itself,   Like the twisted vortex of an endless chasm,   Like the place where parallel lines cross,   Like the apprehension of the abyss,   Rapture can never imagine.      I’ve taken my share of sustenance,    Of beast flesh, tossed on china or tin or ceramic,   Pleasure dripping from quieted tongues,      I have sat in counsel with dark forces   To earn back the tears    Shed in loneliness and self-pity.      I’ve strained to see the sacred vault of heaven,   To ensure to my soul its end,   In passion’s holy bowers:      I’ve been there, where,   The Gods would have us do this,   Still, because our life is ours to make,   Our soul’s final pursuit, survival,   The soul is not in its death.

Barbie Says Math Is Hard   by: Kyoko Mori      As a boy, I'd still have asked    why Jack must spend exactly    two dollars at the corner store.    Give him a coin purse is as    good an answer as five apples    and two oranges. Also: would    he bake the apples into pies    or cobblers, save the orange peel    in glass jars to spice up his    tea or cake? If his father    paints their house with Mr. Jones,    which man will take the peaks and    why? Would the raspberry beetles    swarm over wet paint? Why is    Mr. Jones slower than his    neighbor? If x equals y,    is it like putting apples into    cole slaw, the way a tomato    is really a fruit? None of my    dolls talked or grew hair. In    third grade, Satsuki and I    traded our Barbies' limbs so    mine could flex her left biceps    while hers sat cross-legged    raising one stiff arm    like a weapon. If Satsuki has    daughters, she might remember    the grasshoppers we caught,    how we cupped two hands together    into crooked globes to    hear them rattling inside like    a small motor. She would tell    her daughters: Yes, math was hard,    but not because we were girls.

Although the boat seemed to be more of a home to him and his father since they spent most their days on it, they did live in a small cottage in Galway, Ireland with his mother.  But his mother was always worried about him because he kept to himself and was a very quite gentleman. She would always try to set him up with young ladies in town and plan social gatherings in their house but Jimmy was never interested in finding a bride or making friends. His bride was the sea; to him there was no one as beautiful as she was. During his spare time on the boat he would stare out into the never ending ocean and whisper lines of poetry. His father became worried about him and started to limit the trips they made on the boat, but that never stopped Jimmy from visiting his star crossed lover. He would walk along the beach for hours in till someone came to take him inside.     One day he was sitting on the beach near the tide just starring out into the sea. His eyes were wide and seemed like they were more in a trance than anything else. He heard a voice singing. The voice was unworldly but more beautiful than any other sound that he had ever heard. Then Jimmy noticed something emerging from the water, it was a beautiful woman.  She walked towards him with grace and then he went down on his knee and asked the mysterious woman to marry him. She nodded slowly but she never said a word. Jimmy brought her home to his mother and told her the wonderful news. His mother did not approve but Jimmy didn’t care about his mother’s blessings he loved the mysterious girl. To him she was the sea’s soul. He quickly spread the news despite his shy fa?ade.  Then one person asked him something that changed everything. “What is her name?” Jimmy was baffled. He admitted that he didn’t know but he knew he loved her. After that everyone was against the marriage and everywhere they went people would stare at them, except for their cozy hiding place, the sea.     The wedding was planned and the invitations were sent. The woman was happy to be with her groom but there was something inside her that just didn’t feel right. Jimmy on the other hand felt like he was on top of the world with no doubts at all. He was sure he loved her and that was all he needed. Two nights before the wedding she talked to him for the first time, she talked slowly and just like her singing her voice, when she talked it sounded unworldly but still beautiful. “I have to go back soon Jimmy.” A tear slid down her cheek. He was completely silent and then she explained. “You were right about me. I’m the sea’s soul. I was able to come here in human form but I had no idea what it would do to the sea. Haven’t you noticed it Jimmy? The sea is dead without me.” Jimmy nodded slowly. Then she explained that it was possible for them to be together…forever.  Jimmy would have to give his soul to the sea just like she would have to.  The woman encouraged him to think about it because he wouldn’t be able to come back.     Jimmy and the Woman set off to the ocean that night.  He left a note to his family saying that he left with the Woman and the wedding was off but he wanted them to know that he was truly happy.  The couple went into the sea and was never seen again. The whole town mourned for Jimmy and came to the conclusion that he was dead while The Woman and Jimmy were living happily together…forever.

20090202122448AAHwsqy	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Please tell me what you think about my writing?	The ink from my pen is dripping all over this torn darkpage.The thoughts that consume my head are whirling, pouring out of every hole in my body. My heart keeps beating, my blood still flowing. My foot is already in my grave. I bleed just to know I'm alive. This paper is all I've got. He's with her, she's with him, and I'm with this pen that won't stop ******* dripping. I'll use this razor blade to cut another line, I'll use this paper to pass some more time. Someone get a bucket for these thoughts violently pouring out  of my ears. Someone try to put them back together, because I sure as hell can't. I light another cigarette. I'll chain smoke my cancer until you come back home to me. Forgive me for drinking the whole bottle of wine, and the mascara stains on your bed sheet.  Forgive me for the cigarette stains on the counter, and for the tears on your pillow. The salt will soon dissapear after a wash, but I won't. You might get the scent off, but it's going to take a lot more than bounty to get my imprint off your queen sized bed of lust, lies, and deceit.....
