kvjp8GPnaa	I've got the Saniplus model fitted in an upstairs bathroom - it's been in about 18 months and so far no problems. It does make a bit of a noise but, if it's for a toilet, the noise is no louder and lasts no longer than the cistern refilling. With a bit of ingenuity you can box it in with a bit of soundproofing insulation if required.<br>  <br>  There is a small vent on top, a breather of sorts, with a charcoal insert fitted - there is a slight odour from this but you have to get really close up to smell anything. The charcoal insert needs to be changed yearly apparently.<br>  <br>  You have to be really careful what you put down them though, anything but toilet tissue and the obvious will cause a breakdown. Wet wipes, sanitary towels, anything like that, will block it up.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind when installing it that at some time in it's life you may need to service it so make sure you can get it out without too much aggro. Plan the pipework with this in mind. You can use 1" - 2" pipework for the discharge but bear in mind that you will have to drain the discharge and a 1" pipe holds much less than a 2"! The golden rule when running discharge pipework is to avoid too many bends and only use swept 90 deg bends instead of sharp elbows.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	Wouldn't touch them with a barge pole.

It is super easy to use and install but if your basement only has 8 feet of headspace now you will lose 6-8 inches of that because the floor has to be build up above the toilet.

wipJ9OE7aa	Yeah, I've learned that you really have to be careful about what you purchase at Walmart, they take anything and everything back. Someone probably bought it, switched it with their old one and returned it, now either the person who returned it sealed the box back and told Walmart that they didn't want it or Walmart didn't check and sealed it back. Mostly like the person who bought it did it. People are gross like that. Don't be embarrassed especially since you didn't do it. As long as your firm when you go in there you should be okay. When I worked in retail people use to bring back crazy stuff such as shoes that had clearly been worn, clothing, and towels. I use to get so frustrated because managers would do anything and everything to please these people who were clearing trying to take advantage of the store. One woman had once brought back about 15 towels saying that they didn't wash well and that the die had came off on her son, but she then wanted 15 more of the same exact towels. Basically, she wanted new towels. I'm sorry that this happened to you. I would be so disgusted. I probably would have called the store immediately and then take it back. But nonetheless I'm sure it'll be okay.|`|721dc6202a3a978496a32f796da9793caa	Yes. I bought blinds that had the wrong blinds in the box. I simply took them back and explained and they exchanged it.

Yx2nmc4Yaa	Is there a thermostat on out side of cylinder?If so turn it down to 60*C.If not,get one fitted and in the mean while,turn the boiler temp down as it is heating the water in cylinder to a too high temp,and causing it to back up into cold water tank.|`|w3KDePAeaa	This is a complex question. As I am from a southern state and a fairly warmer climate, we do not use cold storage tanks. A lot of people will use a second "hot" storage tank beside the water heater (or in this case boiler) and the entire system will be on a recirculating pump. okay. That being said is your pump working? If it were to quit, then the water in your WH/boiler would stay in the heating device and not go throughout the rest of the house until you opened a faucet or tub-valve hot side. Thereby, city street pressure or pump (whichever you have) would be the only means of pushing the water into your second storage tank ONLY after there is a negative pressure on the outlet "hot" side. which, by that time the water in your storage tank has become cool. Which means that later in the day... when you need to get hot water you end up with luke warm (at best) instead because your boiler may be working but when the hot water from your boiler is brought into the cold water of your "hot" water storage tank then it mixes and pushes the cold out with the hot. I would look at my recirc pump first if you have one.  About the banging pipes .. get a watter hammer arrestor. Oh yeah if you have recently added the night timer... go check the settings..... or better yet get a plumber to come out and check it for you. preferably the company that installed the unit to begin with. They are licensed for a reason. If they aren't licensed they shouldn't have touched it to begin with. I have a father-in-law who thinks that he can do anything.. But he is always asking me plumbing questions while at "his" customer's house! He doesn't understand everything that I am explaining and I even have to fix some of what he messes up sometimes! Be sure that there is atleast one licensed plumber physically at your house while the work is being done! I have seen some "helpers" who do a good job most of the time but fudge things and cut corners on others. Someone who has taken the years it requires to attain a mechanical contractor's lic. will put their pride into their work. (not all but most) ..

It is a days work and the cylinder itself is around ￡250. and you will probably need a new immersion heater too.    If the former I would suggest ￡900 is about right, bearing in mind someone will have to get a suitably sized replacement tank up there through a trapdoor which will almost certainly be too small!

As it is cold water, get a plastic one. Shut of water supply to the old tank, and drain it out by opening a hot tap. Remove all the fittings and put one side. measure the centre of the holes in the tank, and drill out the same size holes in the same position. You can drill it with woodbits from B&Q or such like. Then position the new tank, and connect all the fittings that were removed. turn on the water to fill the tank, and test for any leakage.

Call a professional plumber! That is what they are there for. If you are unhappy with the price, call another professional plumber in your area. I have recently started my own small business and I can't afford any help yet(just me) . I do all of the advertising, the work and the billing myself (my overhead is nothing).

One big circle but you would get a much cheaper rate and probably done with a little more pride if you get a young entrepreneur to do the work rather than a larger Corporation or business. Just be sure that you don't just hire any old "handyman" who says that he knows how to do "plumbing". Odds are that he may know enough to barely scrape by, and it would save you some money short term. But, since this is an investment property, you want someone to do it right, fast, have all of the tools at their disposal that they require and in the long term, save you money!

w3KDePAeaa	If this is a brand new residence, you have either #1 (most common)a venting problem or #2 a backwards drain.<br>   Let's attack each problem. <br>          #1) If you imagine holding your thumb over a straw filled with liquid, what makes the liquid stay in the straw? Ans-lack of atmospheric pressure to "push" the liquid out. If you remove the thumb, all of the liquid comes gushing out! (even if you just let a little air pressure in. The air "replaces" where the liquid was.<br>     The quickest and cheapest way to solve a venting problem with a kitchen sink would be to install an automatic vent (Studor makes the best available while others may be slightly cheaper). If the your vent becomes "clogged" by squirrels or birds then you can usually wash any of their debris down the drain with a water hose on your roof.  If not rodents, then the original plumber didn't do a very good job and I guarantee that you have a slow drain even on your first sink. You will truly be amazed at the difference a studor vent can make!<br>  <br>   #2) Although this is the unlikely culprit, Maybe you have a drain line that goes into the wall slightly higher than the bottom of your sink.

They will bear the first year, though the second will be much better.<br>  <br>  If you buy a several-years-old Serviceberry shrub.  Select one in the spring with lots of blooms, and it will give you that many fruits in June.<br>  <br>  But really, most fruits (aside from veggies that  botanically classed as fruits...I know you mean what we consider "fruit" in a meal) require an investment of time.  They grow on trees, shrubs, vines and brambles.|`|NiRFYhVDaa	dont know any...i know some vegetables that you can harvest in 3 months but not fruit plant|`|FR9HlyYmaa	Strawberries grow pretty fast, and they are wonderful and great tasting too.

KtDdU1DXaa	Might be too much water. We had this with our Yucca, not giving water for a few weeks helped. Also, taking it out of the pot and changing the soil may help, also if the problem is not water. Don't try to damage too much of the roots, although it's not too delicate.

31dXpgzEaa	Hi, try this. Spread some white toothpaste (not gel) onto the scratch and rub it in. Let it dry, then polish with a soft cloth. This makes the scratch less noticeable. Then try this. Mix a paste of dry mustard and white vinegar, using one part of each. Rub the paste into the scratch with a cloth, then buff with a dry, soft cloth. This is as effective as toothpaste, but some mirrors repair better with mustard paste.|`|AA10283947	A good way to begin would be to use some BRASSO, a metal cleaner with slight abrasive action.<br>  Put some on a cloth and attack the scratch with some vigour, rubbing at the glass in tiny circles, it may take a while to disappear but keep at it ...unless the wound is deep.<br>  Brasso Wadding is also available.<br>  Another method is to use Brasso on the felt ball drill ends that are sometimes in electric mini drill kits, plug in and whizz away.|`|m941ZFDPaa	use cut an polish the type you would use on your car it fills in scratches and is undetectable also works wonders on scratched dvds/cds|`|m53cNF4iaa	Try bathroom cleaner strong one like cif<br>  or just use mirror wipes thats what i use x
bc2c20578f51c5d8576556ddbba6f0a2aa	just keep them watered and let them have plenty of time in the sun.<br>  <br>  if you want to give them a boost you can give them an epsom watering when the flowers start, and again when fruit starts. it's 1T of epsom to 1G of water. <br>  <br>  when they are larger you can either move them to a permanent pot or garden spot|`|NvtetB2laa	Thin to 1 or 2 seedlings per pot. Pots should not be tiny, or the seedlings can become rootbound. Take them outdoors in the daytime and bring them in after dark. The seedlings need to get used to the outdoors. After frost danger is past put them in the ground in a location that gets lots of sun. Depending on soil type, water sparingly. Too much water dilutes the flavor of the tomatoes.|`|3sU90myfaa	Plant them individually in each pot so you will have room..they do not need to go outside untill the night time temperatures or no lower than 65 degrees for better harvest..If indoors they need alot of sun and bottom heat..I have plants going inside right now under flourescent lights, as well as an electric blanket on the table covered with plastic to set them on for bottom heat..It keeps them a nice 80 degrees and I give them 16 hours a day of the light for proper growth..people try to transplant thier tomatoes too early outside..I am In Fllorida and will not transplant mine outside untill around the 1st of april, even though it will be aropund 50 degrees at night here about the middle of march..Plant them when it is not real warm you will cut your harvest down by at least 25%..wait untill the weather is good and warm..heres pictures of my set up...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28022122@N03/3268637097/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/28022122@N0...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28022122@N03/3268636875/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/28022122@N0...</a>

Spruce Pine and Fur all are about the same quality and strength.   <br>  <br>  But if you are looking for stronger woods then you need to be species specific.

MhgLNm3daa	You can find raw fertilizers chemicals in the planted aquarium trade; they like to mix things for special purposes also.  I think that a pound of potassium nitrate is less than ten dollars, for instance. <br>  <br>  As far as non- urea based nitrogen, no problem.  You can get ammonia based nitrogen, or a nitrate salt.  A nitrate salt will also contain potassium, sodium or calcium, unless you go with ammonium nitrate.  I know orchids need quite a bit of nitrogen, but I would think you need to keep the total dissolved salts low.<br>  <br>  As far as trace nutrients, the aquarium or hydroponic trade both offer some solutions.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	High Times Magazine...|`|180035e5602039870639d3ffb09af7d0aa	buy a rabbit and use its poop or chickens but rabbits is the best to use next to bat poop but where are you gonna get that|`|K3gEmRc0aa	Sperm :)|`|BmKewiG3aa	The best fertilizer in the whole wide world is compost.  So make compost, and you will be getting a great fertilizer.  If you don't believe me, go walking in the woods.  See how pretty everything is?  No-one's out there puting chemical fertilizer on the trees, vines, bushes, or wildflowers.  It's all natural compost!  I have orchids, and I use zero chemical on them.  I use moss as compost.  Orchids usually live in rain forests, and there are no chemicals there!|`|gFHTcIc8aa	You could use a urea based fertilizer with the following cautions:<br>  Use the higher nitrogen fertilizer only during orchid peak growth.  Orchid will use more of the available N at this time.<br>  <br>  Switch to a low N formula during periods of slow growth i.e. 5-10-10 .<br>  As you're already aware, excess urea buildup will lead to high salt concentration which can destroy the moisture sensitive Orchid. Insure to water frequently when applying any fertilizer.<br>  <br>  Manure is an organic source of N but it can be difficult to control the amount of N available and the rate at which it's dispersed into soil.  Urea (or SCU--sulfur coated urea) gives you a better means for measurement and control of Nitrogen release.<br>  <br>  As far as micronutrients check out available fertilizers at Lesco.com or JohnDeereLandscapes. Many of their fertilizers have micronutrients: Mn, Zn, Fe added into fertilizer. But they're all Urea based.  It's unlikely though soil PH would be affected to the point of micronutrient deficiency or toxicity.  You can always check this by soil testing and make appropriate correction with Lime and/or Sulfur.<br>  <br>  Edit:  You did not state that you were trying to grow Orchids in bark.  There are species of Orchids which are grown in potting soil.  <br>  You need to be more specific with your details in your original question.  What species of Orchid are you growing?  There are thousands of species of Orchids which have completely different nutrient management strategies.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	I would try a greenhouse, and also I would check into whatever Miraclegrow has because they make ferts for everything. That would save you hassle. Check their website and ask them. Even if you don't buy it is still worth your time to see what they say and what they have listed.

Be careful not to dig too many or you wont have any left to get bigger. Once the plants have died back you will be able to dig the full size tubers. Be careful how you dig so as not to cut into the tuber. To help with this problem we will hill up with soil the first time, then with straw and soil the second time and straw there after. This makes digging easier and helps to maintain moisture. Good luck.|`|yEUo24Znaa	They are ready to harvest once the vine dies.

d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	Daisymae, a competent/professional drywall tradesman knows how to limit debris and dust to almost 0 when working in an occupied residence.  Primarily this is done by blocking off the work in progress zones from the rest of the house, sealing HVAC ductwork, use of dust barricades, and finishing the walls with a finishing sponges and water.  Any sanding is minimal and done with a hand sanding block (those little rubber sanding sponges) also with water.<br>  <br>  I do occupied remodels all the time, in one now, and don't have any problems.  As I understand your description what you need to do is laminate 1/4" or 3/8" drywall over the existing paneling.

V9HNzXFuaa	They actually make little foam insulation things just for this purpose.  All you do is take the cover plate off, put it over the outlet or switch, and put the cover back on.  I think you can get them at home depot or lowes.

You should be able to do it yourself.  Does not take very long and you will notice a difference.  The insulation kits are not expensive at all but will save you a bundle on your heat bills.|`|KSx6E3s0aa	1. You can use expanding foam insulation around the outside of the box. You must be careful that it does not push its way into the back of the box through any of the wire knock outs. <br>  <br>  2. You can also buy foam backing that goes between the cover plate and the outlet box. These cover can be found at you local home centers.<br>  <br>  3. The wire knock outs in the back of the electrical boxes can also be sealed with silicon caulk to stop the air from entering the electrical box.<br>  <br>  All of the suggestions also make you home safer because air moving through an electrical box can turn a spark into a flam. What you do have to be careful is is getting any of this material in the electric box it's self.|`|02A4qFXEaa	The other 2 answers were correct, they do make insulated wall covers.  Please do take apart the box and stuff insulation in, that would be a fire hazard in my opinion.  The plates should be easy to find at any home store or hardware store.|`|vwOwnjUiaa	go to any hardware store, they carry foam pads, that are cut to fit switches and outlets.  you just take the covers off, insert the foam pad, and put the cover back on.|`|evItC2KQaa	You can get foam outlet covers at any home imp.store that go between the outlet and the covers.

Adding refrigerant to your system will not fix the leak, it will only leak out again. On the outdoor unit there will be a manufacturers name tag. The type of refrigerant your system uses will be marked on that tag. If it is an older unit, it will use R-22. Newer systems will use R-410a. Refrigerant can only be purchased by EPA certified refrigerant technicians and is only available from hvac supply houses such as Johnstone Supply, United Refrigeration, CC Dickson, RE Michels, Mingledorff's, and others. Adding refrigerant is charged by the pound. R-22 costs approximately $20.00 to $25.00 per pound. R-410a costs approximately $65.00 to $75.00 per pound. R-22 is an older type of refrigerant and is being phased out of production. R-410a is the newer replacement for R-22. The two refrigerants cannot be mixed and there is a substantial process involved with changing systems over. Locating and repairing a leak can be costly. Leaks can be located using a bubble solution or by using an electronic leak detector. Occassionally the leak will be from a fitting that can be tightened with wrenches. More often than not the leak will have to be fixed by brazing (welding) with a torch. Refrigerant must be removed from the system in order to repair by brazing. Anytime a refrigerant system is opened it is recommended that a new liquid line filter drier be installed. Finding a leak, making the repair, intalling a new filter drier, vacuuming the system down, and recharging the unit typically costs about $375.00 to $400.00. That does not include the cost of the replacement refrigerant. If refrigerant is recovered from your unit, it may or may not be reused, depending on whether it is contaminated or not. If it is not contaminated, it can be replaced into your unit but you will be charged for additional refrigerant to bring the charge to its required amount. Hope this helps.|`|Z6ghljeGaa	First off it may not be as simple as freon, it could be r-14 r-22 r-34a, all depending on what type of system it is.  Second how do you know you're low on it?  If you are low and it's not the first time you probably have a leak you want to get fixed.  It's also possible the system could be overcharged and that would cause just as much of a problem.<br>  <br>  It can also be a bad txv valve or several other things, if you're just assuming it's the same problem you had before.  <br>  <br>  Although if you do decide to buy one of the recharge kits that some one mentioned it will probably be "hot-shot" and completable with many different types of refrigerant, basically just a filler.   Just check to make sure to see what type you're a/c unit uses first.

Good luck!|`|BoO62GMJaa	just take the kids and leave everything else behind|`|88pwJ4jmaa	Take it easy, you can't rush everything. Pack all the small things the you can put into boxes, get boxes from like grocery store so you save you some money, get tape and start taping and fill the boxes with the stuff goes there (As you begin doing this you will get your own idea of how to get the stuff together). Put them some area in your home. Next, look at the bigger things can you take apart for e.g. the bed if you can't leave it till last. If you pack the small things and can take it to the new place yourself that way only the bigger things are left. So I don't know your budget but if nobody can help you call a moving company and tell them that you have just the big things to take couch, t.v., bed and they will do it for but make sure you get lowest rate possible for 2 people to get hired i would not pay more than 50/hour. Also for glass and stuff you can use lots and lots of newspaper to stuff it also save money that way. <br>  <br>  And remember don't panic you will be ok :) it won't be easy, moves are usually tough, annoying, but you got to it so try to get some company to help you like girlfriends or boy friend...It will be faster and more fun that way.<br>  <br>  Anyways, good luck everything will turn out just do it step by step. :)|`|orLUNzrraa	First, take a moment and breathe.<br>  <br>  Second, call everyone you can think of that you trust to watch your children, and set up a schedule where everyone takes them for as much time as they can in the hours that you're not working.  Let your friends and family help you mind the children for the next few weeks.  Use your resources-and make plans for after you've settled into your new house to have them over for a thank you dinner (or perhaps a picnic in a park if your new space is too small).  Ask other friends to help on the actual moving day.<br>  <br>  Third, go to the store.  You'll need extra trash bags, newspapers, markers, tape and cleaning supplies including laundry detergent.  On the way home, pick up boxes from stores and businesses to pack your things in.<br>  <br>  Once you get home, get all the laundry sorted first, then start a load of laundry.  Starting in your linen closet, pack everything you won't need the next few weeks.  Next, go to the children's room and pick out 5 or 6 outfits, and set them aside.  Pack all their other clothes.  Do the same in your room.  Get the first load of laundry drying and get another in to wash.<br>  <br>  Now that you've got the clothes addressed (either packed, set aside for wear, or ready to wash, designate a donation box and get those trash bags ready.  As you pack, throw out or donate anything that you're not ever going to use again.  Remember that you're moving to a smaller space, so you may need to downsize what you have.<br>  <br>  You'll want to have one box that you label #1.  This will be the first box you unpack (you may need a #2 and #3).  In box #1, put a full set of bedding for each bed, three towels, several washcloths, and a clean set of clothes for everyone.  As you pack, you will want to add items like bath supplies, cooking supplies, plates, etc.  These every day supplies will be the last things you pack, but it's important to have boxes set aside for them.<br>  <br>  Next, start packing the unessentials, room by room.  Leave aside some toys, and other activities for the children, but pack all your knickknacks, extra blankets, dishes you won't use this week, books, etc.  Set aside an area for packed boxes so you aren't walking around them while you're living in the current house.<br>  <br>  As you get closer to time, start packing the essentials after you use them for the last time.  As you wash and dry laundry, if you won't need it this week, pack it away.  Label all of your boxes.  As you get each room completely packed, take a trashbag in and get rid of all the trash, wipe down the walls, and vacuum.<br>  <br>  On the last day, wash the windows, pull the stove and fridge out and clean behind them.  Clean and wash the oven and inside of the fridge.  Do a final check in all the cabinets to make sure they're empty, and then wipe them out.  Drop off the donations.<br>  <br>  You CAN do this!<br>  <br>  Good luck in your new home!

kvjp8GPnaa	It sounds like you've got your hands full there Rene.<br>  <br>  As per the previous correspondence you need to get your landlord involved, partly to sort out the soundproofing but also to make him aware of your neighbour's unreasonable behaviour. You don't mention whether your neighbour is also a tenant of your landlord.<br>  <br>  As to the soundproofing a possible solution is to take up sufficient flooring to expose all the voids between the joists - you might be lucky and find that the joists run perpendicular to the run of the corridor so you only need to take up one floorboard - and then fill the voids with loose insulation, the kind of thing you get blown into your attic to insulate it. I have used this method in the past where we had an upstairs bathroom above a kitchen and I wanted to reduce the noise - it worked fine. The only thing to watch out for is that you don't cover over inset light fittings in your neighbour's ceiling or they will overheat.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this.|`|180035e5602039870639d3ffb09af7d0aa	tell your landlord shes bitchen.tell him or her to live with it maybe she should live by herself in her own place.but you could try rubbing baby powder all over the floor into the cracks.this should reduce squeaking.what about runner rugsin your walking paths?|`|AuVtjlqGaa	Put area rugs down.

If she complains again why don't you ask if you can go down into her flat while someone else walks the corridor so you can hear the noise. Then you will get a better idea of how much noise and how to deal with it.

AA11078918	You could report to your local authorities as it appears that someone shot your squirrel with a blow gun. Think about your neighbors, who has a teenager, most likely male, who might have done this. Or you could ignore it and bury it, then hope the person who did it doesn't target your dog or the neighbors cat.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DHt8w4oFaa	awwwwwwwwwwww .. poor squirrelllll, yes bury it :( & have a whole big ceremony with you & your dog .. that is sooo sad & cruel!!|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Just bury it down around 2 feet or so. Some young person probably shot it with a blow dart gun but it could be something else like some fancy trap or something, or maybe it rolled around and got something impalled in its neck. I wouldn't worry about it I would just bury it.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	You could bury it yourself.  If you do not want to do that you may be able to take it to a local vet and he may be able to take care of the animal for you.
AA11656886	If the fuse is ok then it is the transformer or your outlet. Check the breaker or run an extension cord from another outlet. Generally it is the fuse, they are really small and can be hard to see if they are broken. You should also have a reset button. If nothing else works un plug for 1 hr and re try. You can buy the transformer seperate if it is bad.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Look for a reset button inside the control box.|`|FgTkF31iaa	The problem is likely the transformer check the voltage and try replacing it.|`|LPamjcQIaa	Try the reset button and or try unplugging it for about 5 minutes then plugging it back in.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't correct it the board or transformer is bad but easily replaceable but could be expensive compared to a new unit..

R8v712Gvaa	Well, I had the same problem. For pots and pans, you could buy a rack to put above a sink or island or table. For Tupperware you could claim one shelf for ALL Tupperware and Corning Ware. You would then stack the Tupperware smallest to largest inside of each other with largest at the bottom and smallest at the top. You would also put the lids in a separate basket near the Tupperware.  Glasses could also claim two or three shelves and organize the glasses by if they are formal wine glasses or just water-drinking glasses. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped :)|`|AA11287854	Check home improvement stores, they will have lots of products that can help you organize your kitchen. They also have people that can help if you're still unsure. Also try The Container Store.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	In our home we only keep what we use.  We do not keep what we may need or may use.  This only takes up space that we could use for something else.  When organizing your kitchen get rid of the things that are just taking up space.  By doing this you will be surprised as to how much more space you will have available for storage.|`|Bg3lbGR1aa	brat is right... if you purchased a your tupperware as a set, but only use the small containers... find a new home for the others. Getting rid of stuff that you are not using is a good way to free up space. I know where you are at because I've been there too.<br>  <br>  A pot/pan rack over an island or by your range would free up space... so would a rack for wine glasses, use your lazy susan (if it's inside your cabinetry) for spices that are most commonly used.
AfnOU04paa	It would be good to know if you think you have plenty of cupboard space or not enough.  Most of us would like more, so I will assume that is part of your disorganization problem. Get rid of everything you hate or haven't used in years.  If it's a gift, put it in a storage box.<br>  <br>  Basically, keep all things that are alike or that you use together in the same place.  That way if you are baking, for instance, the bowls, sifter, measurers, etc. are in the same place.<br>    <br>  First of all, Tupperware and other plastic storage containers are the biggest pain in the butt, and no matter how I stack them, they end up in a jumble.  But, I have gotten rid of all containers except Tupperware, and it is much easier to stack and sort them into one cupboard or one shelf, or a deep drawer.    <br>  <br>  All of my pots, pans, skillets, their lids are dedicated to one large cupboard.  Everything is stacked smaller inside of the other with most used sauce pans in front.  If you have room, a wire lid rack can be purchased at Lowe's.  It screws onto the shelf, and pulls out for access without standing on your head.  The Corning Ware I dedicate to a certain shelf with lid on upside down, and stacked.  The handles go in the utensil drawer.<br>  <br>  All baking pans, muffin tins, pie plates, quich pan, bundt cake pan, etc. are in one cupboard or shelf.   Mixing bowls, measuring cups, sifter, nut cruncher, funnels, gravey separater are on part of one shelf.<br>  <br>  All coffee mugs are together, and all glasses are together in one cupboard.  <br>  <br>  Dishes:  dedicate one cupboard for the whole set.  Stack like items.  A  two tier corner wire shelf will give you extra place for lunch plates or saucers.  Fit the little dipping saucers inbetween or keep them together with your serving bowls and platters.  If you have crystal that you use only occasionally, keep all on a top shelf.    <br>  <br>  Flatware in one drawer, if room put some of the utencils you seldomly use in the back of the drawer.  All other utencils, spatulas, flippers, spoons, tongs, measuring spoons, mellon ballers, garlic squishers into another drawer.  Too many utencils?  Split them up into odd things you don't use every day into a smaller drawer.<br>  <br>  If you have room for a plastic 4 tier shelf in the basement or garage, keep all the big stuff like fryers, pressure cooker, soup pots, trays, griddles on it.  Throw a sheet over it.  Kill your husband if he puts his oil funnel on it. <br>  <br>  Put spice jars on the turntable.  I have one shelf for only spices and seasonings.<br>  <br>  Under the sink I keep scouring powder, polishes, soap, sponges and rags, glass cleaner; basically all cleaning items you use frequently.  I suggest you put some sort of lock on the doors anyway.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	I suggest you put things in the area you use them..under my sink I put a little metal shelf, one I picked up at Walmart for just a few dollars. That gave me twice the room under there for storage...I have dish soap, dishwasher soap, all the kitchen cleaners for the stainless and granite and windows, and I store light bulbs there too with the extra storage I made. If you have a corner cabinet, then the lazy susan would be perfect for that, so you don't have to reach in..you can put anything on it..crackers, canned items, anything you want to store in there..as for your tupperware that is a hard one (I threw mine out) stack all you can and get the metal storage rack that screws on to the inside of your cupboard door to store all the lids, but make sure your lids will fit into this..small saucers can be placed either with your dishes, or with your mixing bowls..depends on how often you use them..the best thing I can tell you is to store your most used items neatly at arm's reach and the least used items in those cupboards you never use (above the fridge, or above the stove).Every time you get something out of the cupboard, ask yourself whether there is a better spot (more convenient) and go from there.

Not your normal house plant. a.k.a.  san-si-ver-ia (latin name, or something close to that.)|`|2zgv89OQaa	The Cast Iron Plant, Aspidistra elatior, was so named because it can grow under the worst of conditions, including deep shade. It’s great for the corners of your place. It was very popular in Victorian homes, when windows weren’t as numerous or as large as they are today. It’s slow growing and will tolerate temperatures to just below freezing. Occasionally it will produce small purplish flowers. It is pest resistant as well and it doesn’t require a lot of watering. Simply keep the soil moist.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I second the mother in laws tongue suggestion. Also called a snake plant.<br>  <br>  Literally you only have to water it once a month or so during the winter.

All I do is water them twice a week--they don't even need direct sunlight.  I even have one start from the monster where I just cut off 6" lengths from the bottom and stuck them in water about a year ago.  The vase is filled with roots, and I just never got around to replanting them, but they're doing great.  Also, if you really like a girl who wants a start, you could stick one in a vase for her so the roots will grow out.

x86mC8yyaa	You might increase your chances by hanging different sorts of feeders from the edges of your bird table, eg peanut feeder, fat balls, niger seed (in a special feeder) for goldfinches etc. Also make sure you are putting out the proper food - High Energy No Mess mixture is a high-calorie mix of hulled sunflower seeds and other seeds which won't make a mess on the ground below like unhulled sunflower seeds will do. (visit www.birdfood.co.uk ) For a real treat, especially in the nesting season, try mealworms (put them in a little pot to stop them wriggling away if you use live ones, or if you don't fancy this you can buy freeze-dried.) Also you might try scattering some seed around on the ground under your table, for ground feeding birds. You might also try screwing your feeders on to special poles you can buy to stick in the ground, because then you can experiment to find where the birds like to fly down to, and also spread out the feeding area so they don't feel so crowded. Birds do like to have a bush or tree to land on before they fly down to the feeders, they sort of have a look around to see if it's safe before committing themselves. If you plant your sorbus a few feet away from the table, this will help, as will any other large shrubs or trees you may have in your garden. Don't put out too much food at first, little and often is best, as it will go mouldy if not eaten, or blow off the table and attract the rats (this is the main problem with tables, as opposed to hanging feeders, which are more waterproof and contain the food more effectively until it's eaten.)|`|haCssg2Laa	cats and birds dont mix<br>  <br>  but birds do like a bit of protection/shelter nearby too<br>  and are always aware of predetors<br>  <br>  you should get birds almost immediately if they feel safe<br>  if they do not, you will have a battle on your hands<br>  <br>  the reason your neighbours have birds is their garden is enclosed<br>  i have 4 bird tables, all near trees and fences<br>  cats dont seem to be a problem despite my neighbours having them<br>  move the table a bit nearer the fence, and put out something tasty for them, they will soon learn its a safe place to feed<br>  <br>  they do get cheeky and will wait for you to feed them very quickly<br>  i love watching them<br>  and kudos to you for thinking of our feathered friends|`|h3s02b3Jaa	I'm sure your neighbours birds will soon find your table. Make sure you put out a variety of food in different feeders. We find we get different birds at different times of the year, so do not be surprised if they seem to come and go. But when they start feeding, especially at nesting time, make sure the table is always filled up. We sometime have to do this every day.

Wait until the word spreads among the flock. <br>  <br>  Food must suit the birds.  There are different seeds (few eat millet, you need to supply the better seeds)  plus some eat fruit or protein......meal worms for example.  Robins are wanting meal worms big time right now.  <br>  <br>  Water is always necessary.  <br>  <br>  If you want a resident population, have the nesting potential in the garden.  The Sorbus is a good start.  You may need to add other food and nesting plants.  Don't forget the nectar feeders by adding the appropriate flowers and feeders for them.|`|FlsrXuJOaa	It can take a couple of weeks for the birds to find a new feeder. But once they do, get ready to keep it filled! :) Also, most birds like fresh food, so if they haven't found your feeder in a week or so, you should consider changing out the food, so that when they do find it, they will want to eat the food and keep coming back.

FlsrXuJOaa	it is a great time to start most of your veggies indoors. Pumpkins are a little different though.

It will probably take a couple years to actually grow a championship pumpking.<br>  <br>  If you want to, you need to find shelter where it won't get frostbite, rained on, or anything that could harm it's growth. Try to limit only one pumpkin per plant.<br>  <br>  It will be very hard to do, but if you plan on entering a "cool looking" pumpking contest, you could take a squar plastic box, and still the tiny pumpkin (when it is still immature) into a hole in the box. Put soil in it or something confortable for the pumpking to grow on. When it starts to bulge out of the box, crack the box (with a hammer) and pull the pumpkin out. You have a square pumpkin!

Bg3lbGR1aa	I know that old houses are seldom ever pest free, especially if they've been unoccupied for a long time. If you are getting roaches in your kitchen then you need to be looking for water leaks. <br>  <br>  When I moved into my old farm house, I remember the roaches being mainly in the baths & kitchen, and then we found that there wasn't enough ventilation underneath the house and there was a water leak in the plumbing that goes from the kitchen sink & one in the bathroom lavatory.<br>  <br>  We sprayed POISON, but also had the plumbing redone and that fixed our problem. I haven't had roaches since. I bought something called BUG STOP @ walmart. I believe it was a full gallon with a hose/sprayer for under $7.00. It's clear, and doesn't have a smell. I sprayed it all along the moulding, corner of walls and the ceilings, inside cupboards/cabinets, and left open for 24 hours. Spray the exterior of the house too, the steps, door frames etc.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|zBKUS5hxaa	Look for "Integrated Pest Management" solutions.  The secret will be to remove whatever the roaches are eating and drinking.  You've got to keep an absolutely clean house.  Even a drop of oil is a feast to a roach, so you've got to cut off their food supply.  Eventually they will go.<br>  <br>  Stop using poisons in your house.  The roaches will only adjust and you are subjecting yourself to things bad for your health.<br>  <br>  That should help.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Cockroaches are kinda hard to get rid of.  Might want to hire an exterminator to get rid of them.   Or you could call an exterminator to see what they may recommend you use to get rid of them if you can not afford an exterminator.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Yeah, call the pros or you will be battling them for ever.
Ncu1wJU4aa	Probably, if you know what that smells like.<br>  Compressor burn outs usually blow the compressor wiring terminals out and that's how you would smell it. All the refrigerant would be lost.<br>  If your compressor is still under warranty (usually 5 years) it may be worth the repair otherwise replace the whole unit.<br>  If your smelling it inside it may be something burning near the electric heating elements or faulty fan motor.
w3KDePAeaa	You have a problem downstream somewhere. If you know your neighbors fairly well ask if they are having at least slow drains. You could have a city stoppage although doubtful. It is probably in your own drain lines. You probably won't  have to dig up your yard just yet though so don't freak out. You can have a licensed plumber come out and "pull" your toilet to access your drain lines. They would then "snake" out your lines and remove your blockage. Back in ship shape! The ice cream salt WILL help once your roots that you have now are removed IF it is a root problem! Call the plumbing company and ask if they have a camera service.. If they do you may pay an extra $50 or so but you would know what your problem was AND they could locate the problem outside as well for you for repairs or they may recommend a re pipe (YIKES!) Get ready for a bumpy ride but hope for a smooth landing. Hope I helped.|`|Wrf5orAuaa	You can hire an electric eel drain cleaning machine which has flexible drive cables with a cutter on the end to cut through roots and blockages inside the pipe.<br>  Your dad can use it and clear your drain in a couple of hours.|`|LJM0zMNPaa	Call in a professional drain auger company.<br>  If the pipe is THAT cloggged the stuff you put down the drain probably won't cut it.<br>  You could buy a 25 to 50 snake yourself and try using that..it might get you some relief.<br>  Eric|`|LPamjcQIaa	1st;  if you your father or friend are a bit mechanically inclined rent a  power auger(snake) from a Home Depot or other rental co. Make sure it's one with it's own motor.<br>  <br>  There pretty straight forward machines.<br>  <br>  From the description it sounds like there is a clog down from the clean out that slowly drains but eventually backs up to the house thus creating standing water in the toilet sinks tub etc... <br>  <br>  If it's roots then product's available to consumers woun't do a thing. A plumber will be able to determine this if the blockage cannot be opened with the auger.<br>  <br>  Start at the 'clean out' working the snake away from the house(towards the blockage). <br>  <br>  Depending on where the clog is this should open the line up.<br>  <br>  You'll know the clog is open when you don't see any more water standing at the clean out.<br>  <br>  If you cant reach the blockage with the power snake then you'll have to call the pro in that's got a longer auger snake.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	call roto rooter...they'll clear it out in 30 minutes and charge you $120-150<br>  <br>  worth it|`|wH9f3FcKaa	You can rent a snake from your local rental store and run it down through the pipes.  If it is a normal obstruction or buildup the snake will dislodge it.  If it is a root, it will not go through the pipes.  It is a lot cheaper than a plumber and may help.  In our area, they are about $25 to rent.

4qTlIEWyaa	Very carefully dab some "Goof-Off" on the paint.|`|BVJBY4eQaa	Paint spillage<br>  <br>  The secret is to act quickly whilst the paint is still wet. Remove the excess using a knife or wallpaper scraper, taking care not to scratch the surface, and work form the outside in to avoid spreading it further. Once the bulk is removed, mop up the rest with a cloth or paper towel, again working from the outside. Finally, clean the area with Leather Shampoo.<br>  <br>  This is a tricky problem once the paint is dry. If the finish on the leather does not simply allow you to pick it off (some do and some don't) then you ned to try cleaning the area first with LTT Maxi Cleaner.(this is a strong detergent cleaner),  If it won’t come off with this, then I’m afraid there’s nothing you can safely use without damaging the leather. Don’t be tempted to use brush cleaner, white spirit, turps or nail varnish remover as these are likely to damage the leather finish and make final repairs difficult or impossible. Instead, leave it to the professionals who should be able to reduce the paint stain and colour over any residues.<br>  <br>  Please do not use a magic eraser as this will only rectify the problem by removig the finish on the leather and will cost even more to fix.|`|om89gdFIaa	Get a cotton-bud, dip it in nail polish remover; tap off the excess, then go over the paint.  It should come off immediately.  Then go over it with  a damp sponge.  Next time, make sure you cover all your furniture with dust sheets, or remove it out of the room first.  Remove everything posible that you can.  That way, the only thing that gets paint on it, apart from what you want, is yourself!|`|3HSNFDaJaa	Didn't your husband cover it either! I got white emulsion paint off a black leather sofa 2 weeks ago by rubbing with olive oil. Try somewhere inconspicuous first.|`|nyD9cGVVaa	will it not just pick off?
4z0Rk4Ddaa	The generic ones do not work as well as the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.  If you want to, you could probably take a sponge and dip it into Mr. Clean cleaning solutions or pour some Mr. Clean cleaning solution onto a sponge and you would have the same effect as a Magic Eraser.<br>  Only difference would be is the sponge will not dissolve after so many uses like the Magic Eraser does.|`|VWpEZhnDaa	generic ones are being sold at dollar stores nowadays. that might be a better option than trying to make one! it might even be cheaper! gooood luck!

Make sure you bag it or the "pooh" will just get shredded and spit back out on to the lawn.  You can pay someone to mow just your back yard if you don't want to do it.  Tell them you want it bagged.

Rather i m also wish to buy second hand furnitures having good conditions instead of getting new one. In fact i already hv secondhand old furniture at my home which r in good condition, whereas i am capable to buy new one, but why should i spend my money un-necessary and also remember that one day that new furniture will also become old. So the important thing is that we should maintain those things properly. In this way we also save some money which can be used  4 some other house holds or as required. We dont need to expense our money un-necessarily which hv hardly earned.  So come on Cheers up.

If you are a bit handy, the materials, called wet blanket can be purchased for -$100.00. The existing insulation can be scraped off w/ a putty knife and removed. However you must remove the burner to do this. This could be a problem if you break the bolts. If all goes well it is a simple matter to cut the new blanket w/ a  scissor and to install it in sections, as large as is manageable. Having this done by a tech. will cost at least $200.

4z0Rk4Ddaa	Need to purchase Tide on the go pen.  You can keep one at work, in your car so when situations like this arise you are covered.  Or you could keep an extra blouse in your car so if this happens again is all you have to do is change.  Seeings that the blouse is silk what ever you use at work to remove the stain will leave a mark probably worser then the mark you all ready have on your shirt.  Better off to leave it until you get home.  Or try to cover up by wearing a sweater or something if possible.|`|RTgMgT6baa	solvent based cleaner or dry cleaner|`|cpmiJQyIaa	Wow, I just answered another question almost identical to this one.  It must be a really rough week for silk.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I would not recommend using anything but a delicate fabric wash.  The best you can do is use water and dab it, do not rub it.  Anything else may ruin the fabric.  You can try to run someplace on a break and get some delicate fabric wash like Woolite or Delicare.  Most dollar stores carry their own brands, as well, if that helps. Wet stain and apply a little of the laundry wash.  Work in gently and rinse.  Hopefully that will remove most of it.  Blot dry as best as you can.<br>  <br>  When you get home you will have to hand wash the garment with a gentle laundry wash like Woolite of Delicare.  Do not use anything else, except a laundry wash specifically designed for silk and other delicate fabrics.  I personally use Delicare.<br>  <br>  Use only cold water and apply laundry wash to the already wet stain.  Work in gently.  Follow laundry wash instructions for hand washing.  Rinse and wash only in cold water.<br>  <br>  Once garment is washed and rinsed, air dry only.  Do not put it in the dryer.  Once it is completely dry, check to see if stain is gone.  If not, repeat washing steps.

We do clean them, but essentially what we do is what just about anyone could do, with the right products. It would probably be cheaper for you to do it yourself, unless you are wanting to have them sanded and refinished, which yields much better results, but also costs more.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	I myself would just do the job myself and save all of that money.<br>  Sometimes you can do a better job yourself.  Instead of paying them to do it just go out and purchase a steam cleaner and do it yourself.|`|AVsdfdMSaa	You could do it yourself, why bother to have a special service. My friend is a big fan of tv stuff and she bought a H2O Mop to help her to clean the floor,may you could try it.|`|WtqsWctjaa	Instead of giving hard earn money to professional try Lustro Italiano Cleaner  which always work for me. You can find it in my source site.
FlsrXuJOaa	Most sod cannot be cut until it comes out of dormancy. It might be a little too early for bermuda sod to have had a chance to green up, so you might have to wait a little bit. Call a local garden center that sells sod and ask when they start selling it. In the meantime, it is probably not too early to start preparing your yard for new sod.<br>  <br>   Btw, you shouldn't need to till the ground. The sod just needs contact with the soil. If you till, you will stir up dormant weed seeds and by the time it really starts warming up, you will have a yard full of weeds!|`|HwfYEQUOaa	By the end of March will be fine. Even if it hasn't warmed up good yet, you can lay the sod and keep it watered. It will start growing when the temperatures get right. Spray the yard with Roundup first to kill all weeds prior to planting, then till them into the soil. Level the yard insuring proper drainage, then plant green side up.|`|AA11656886	I live in Marietta and have been doing landscaping and irrigation in the Atlanta area for 12 years. It really is not hot enough for Bermuda sod until May. Most sod company's wont even have it until then. The best way to prep your yard is to spread some topsoil (1") over the area and then lay the sod on it. I think you should install an irrigation system first due to the drought. ( I do that on the side ).|`|Z0hgioE8aa	You are correct about March being the right time to sod in Atlanta.  Most people from other parts of the country are unfamiliar with the hot summer that starts early here.  I would agree with not tiling the yard and suggest a fertilizer with halts to prevent those weeds from germinating and growing up through your new sod.
