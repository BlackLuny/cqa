3AChQgbZaa	It's really up to EA.  Valve doesnt have developers for PS3.  Becasue 360 and PC architecture are very similar its easy to port games between them.  If it does go to ps3, it would be outsourced to EA like the orange box.  I have it for PC and its alright, it gets repetitive though|`|HcZppReOaa	Don't think it will.<br>  <br>  I wish it did.<br>  <br>  It's out for PC though.|`|n3cN61enaa	Probably. More like eventually. And get a 360 man!!|`|kKaBXd9Oaa	Not Sure... Sorry..
XqNvIcw3aa	Well Banjo Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts is fun for a while, I would insist that you go with the Orange Box. For starters the Orange Box comes with FIVE games and has, my estimate from experience, at least twice as much gameplay time than Banjo Kazooie. The Orange Box is also cheaper and extremely good reviews, ratings, and won several gaming awards. Banjo Kazooie, through MY experience, is not very much fun after beating the game, while the Half Life 2 and Portal games are some of the only single-player games that I still beat over again. As a plus the Orange Box comes with TeamFortress: 2, which is just plain fun. <br>  Now don't get me wrong, Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts is fun... it just doesn't compare to the Orange Box. :D|`|XxU94aKlaa	The Orange Box is cheaper and a better bang for your buck in my opinion (4 games for $20). The 4 games could probably keep you entertained until you got enough money together to go back and get the Banjo Kazooie game as well.<br>  Then again I didn't enjoy BK:N&B much personally.

DWJOMWQ8aa	It was probably saying that an older model of GeForce wouldn't be supported, like GeForce 2 or 3 series. But I am pretty confident that it will support GeFroce 6 series and up.<br>  <br>  I also think it will run just fine on Vista.|`|B20bhtioaa	It will be alright.

lQGDV7MEaa	In the past year, I think I was really let down by Haze. Seriously, it looked like a good game, but when I bought it, it wasn't anything better than any other army game.<br>  <br>  But the biggest disappointment of 2008 had to have been Spore. It was the most overhyped game in history, and it was let down by poor execution and tedious gameplay.|`|hqY5XwMiaa	I was actually excited about echochrome, but when i played it, i got bored after 10 minutes.|`|4IwVNpJ7aa	Most of them were good.

CGfJ7fsRaa	It's a wierd rankign system. I'm currently rank 3. but there are level 2's who are just as good as me and level 4's who i can own. never seen a level 5 though.<br>  It's not a point ranking system like COD4.<br>  I think it's a win to lose ratio. but the level of the team you play also comes into account.<br>  Playing well and winning is the only way. but since team work can't really be statisitcal shown, the ranking system is flawed.<br>  A personal thought on rankign up is the way you kill someone, chainsawing alot doesn't help. I never ever chainsaw and i keep my rank, while other chainsaw loads and get no ranks. Personally i think torque bow and sniper are the best way of killing some1. the creme ala creme of kills has to be a headshot with the magnum though (boltok pistol).<br>  no one really understands the ranking system since it's such a talked about topic on GOW2,

I played Crisis Core, and that was decent, but nothing to write home about.<br>  And graphics are joke. I wouldn't care if a game looked like Goldeneye: 007 (for the N64) as long as it had good, fluid gameplay.<br>  <br>  Obviously not getting Best Answer here, but whatever...|`|LctX2cGbaa	Final Fantasy X is an AMAZING game. The characters had great personalities, the story was more than just exciting, the battle system was really fun, and the graphics were breathtaking. I couldn't help but want to be an actual character in the game, although that would've been dangerous with Sin lurking around.|`|Tdps3Xx3aa	hmm X......a very odd game indeed the battle system is weird as heck. That sphere grid thing is pointless everyone can be exactly the same save what jobs they are. The story is one of those holy crap things that turns into wtf. The music is odd and the voice acting in english is somewhat annoying.<br>  <br>  It's a fairly good game but man it's not that great, the new generation that got the PS2 love it cause it's there first one just like all the FFVII fans who started with the playstation or even me I started with the NES and SNES I and VI are still great to me.|`|EC91Nam0aa	arre you ok? if u are stop looking so deep into a /game its PRETTY CREEPY k? kinda weird... its just a game, u play it, beat it, and move on... if it is an art(i wouldnt know) is it reely important? might as well just say its an amazing game u gotta try right?

30nfKtMhaa	Sure why not? - They have improved Runescape A LOT since two years ago! You have some catching up to do :P<br>  <br>  There are better graphics now especially with the new HD feature. <br>  <br>  There are also new games for you to try out also as a non-member on Runescape like: Clan Wars, The Great Orb Project, Bounty Hunters, Fist of Guthix, and the Duel Arena. -- So you might not be as bored :D<br>  <br>  You can also go to PVP world which are specal worlds in which the entire world is a wilderness expect Lumbridge and Safe Zones. <br>  <br>  I think you should just go back to your old account if it was a medium - high level. If not then you can always make a new account. Since your account isn't a member anymore you can always upgrade to the members feature again, but I suggest you do this after you get used to Runescape and its new features again.<br>  <br>  Find out more at:<br>  <a href="http://www.runescape.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.runescape.com</a><br>  <br>  If you want to try World of War Caft go for it. <br>  <br>  You can always play both =P<br>  <br>  I Hope This Helped =]|`|bacgwHhOaa	WoW > Runescape<br>  Real Life > WoW<br>  WoW=takes life|`|s9d8I0Uaaa	runescape is better. but coming back to it is complicated. you forget how the whole game worked. and wow costs. so they are both gay!|`|2f780106b6266fa3be1b34e9e9d15f0aaa	Runescape sucks..<br>  <br>  WoW sucks now that the expansion is out.. <br>  <br>  Go play Warhammer.|`|FdZySYsiaa	In my opionion runescape is better, because it's less addictive. Runescape can be fun especially if you were a member, i think you should go back to being a member because if you don't you probably won't be able to put anything in your bank account. once i got bored on runescape so i just saved up my money and baught a ton of stuff and gave it to the new players they really apprieciated it. <br>  <br>  Sorry about the 6 misspellings.|`|qZCzlkL1aa	WoW is fun but you have to learn to limit yourself on how much yo play or it will become to addicting. Runescape has been improved but it still isn't necessarily good. Go with WoW id say i play its very fun.|`|YAoTPiv0aa	I'd say WoW is probably better if you don't mind paying, but it is a bit expensive for a game. Or try something else, i recomend guild wars if you don't mind the level cap|`|0jvrbgEVaa	get a xbox360 and have some fun on dat|`|PQy6if0Waa	WoW if anything... they made Runescape terrible.

Yeah, I didn't have much fun on the pc either. I bought mine (xbox) for about 45 bucks (versus its new $ 60 pricetag).  Mind you I had my gamer card that had taken off another 10% and I was lucky to find one around 50 dollars.  <br>  In my opinion used may be the cheapest way to go while still getting a near new quality game.  The same goes for PS3. You can get one used or refurbished for a much lower price but I wouldn't suggest it.  You miss out on the warranty and things like that so if you really want a ps3 just save up or trade in some old games you don't want.  I was able to buy my new 60 gb xbox for about 200 with all the ps2 games I traded!  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps you, peace out
BiMeb75Gaa	To use DS download play you must have a friend with a Nintendo DS that is playing a game and has selected multiplayer. DS Download play is not Wi-fi, you get Wi-Fi on the actual games. I'm sorry but there is not much you can do with the DS when you don't have games. If you have a Nintendo Wii you can download demos of games onto your DS using download play.|`|PpgJUpINaa	I have a Nintendo DS. The thing is, you have to have a cartridge in your DS to play with the Wi-Fi Connection. You can only downloadle software on the DS if another DS is sending you software to play. BTW, this software is usually only for multiplayer matches. Since the DS doesnt hav memory, you cant actually store software on it. Also, you can download software temporarily from the Wii on the Nintendo Channel Its in the DS Demo section. Sorry about the bad news...|`|59AZ4GKVaa	Hello, here is your friend Joey with yet another answer to give to people in need like you. Ok, the way I see it, you don't have any games.

Game on !!|`|NjcV19f3aa	Oh my sister has a ds but im the one that plays with it the most.

When you are at an area where wifi is free, then (I've never done it but i think..) you can search the web. :) I hope i helped.|`|c231bbpTaa	You either need to be in a store with a DS download play spot like gamestop.

It is one of the most popular RPGs online at the moment with a massive following. You can play for free to start with and if you want more you can gain membership for around ￡5.00 per month. That money entitles you to more skills, better rewards, armour, more towns and cities to visit and much more. There are also community rules to stick to as there are children playing too. For instance, no swearing, and in fact, most of the swearing is blanked out with stars. There are forums to talk about all aspects of the game, and also outside of game forums too. You can put ideas to the creators on the forums for future updates, and lots of other fun stuff.

uctxzjIIaa	The PS2 version (compared to Gamecube) has 1 extra superweapon, 1 extra costume, and a new 5-hour side game where you play as a different character. But it has worse graphics. The cutscenes are all done with pre-rendered movies, so the costume you choose does not show up in them, but you can now watch the cutscenes from a new option in the main menu.<br>  <br>  The Wii upgrades that new superweapon, keeps the graphics of the Gamecube (including putting the costumes in the cutscenes, except for the new costume on the PS2), and keeps all the gameplay modes from the PS2. It also adds cursor aiming through the Wiimote, which actually lets you aim while moving (though you still have to stop to shoot).<br>  <br>  <br>  The Wii version is the definitive version. So long as you have a Wii, there's no reason to buy any other version.|`|PpgJUpINaa	Gamecube version has somewhat superior graphics than PS2. PS2 version has extra Ada Wong side missions and other little extras. The Wii version is the best by far. It combines the superior GameCube version's graphics with the PS2's extras and gives it sublime controls to make possibly my favourite game even better! So, yeah, go for the Wii version!

3l9aYnXVaa	You can cancel ANY movie including the Flash Kick, depends on how you have your controller set up. For example med punch and med kick together would create a focus attack. Or if you change your controller around you can have 1 button be specificly a focus attack.<br>  <br>  Now to cancel a move you have to start the move and right as you start the move you push and hold the focus attack button and while holding it you dash by pressing forward forward or back back.<br>  <br>  So for the flash kick cancel you would hold down than up and kick to start the flash kick then as soon as you let go of up and kick you hold down focus attack and while holding press back back or foward foward to cancel the attack.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	You can cancel regular moves and the flash kick is not a regular move.|`|912Gde6Naa	the above poster that said you can only cancel regular attacks is wrong. Please don't  post advice if you don't know the answer. Infact if you do the challenges you would see that some combo's require you to cancel out of moves such as the flash kick or ken and ryu's dragon punch. The second poster is exactly right, to cancel out of a move (any move) you use and hold focus attack while dashing (left left or right right) and you do it all as if it were a combo.

It will not be considered Rock Band 3 but it's own title track. Hope this information is helpful to you.|`|UQWusO1waa	I didnt even know they were gay,|`|PpgJUpINaa	Check www.ign.com
PpgJUpINaa	CoD WaW is definately worth buying for the Wii, especially if you dont have XBOX 360 or PS3. It my not have great graphics, but it have brilliant controls. I found games like Metroid Prime 3 and Red Steel easy to use with the Wii remote, but CoD 5 was hard to get used to with the Wiimote. Having said this, the controls are fantastic once you get used to 'em and are better tha XBOX 360's or PS3's controls. BTW, the online set up is pretty good! There is always someone playing CoD 5 online so you wont get lonely!|`|qvnrag48aa	Yeessss and I totally agree with the other guy that answered
d9329ea0bdca3de02039a3f70fc57a5faa	To increase your money, you can either: lower player wages or get a better sponsor at the end of each season.<br>  <br>  When you get a sponsor, also look if there is a win bonus deal under where you find how much they pay you each game, that way when you win you get a lot more money each game.<br>  <br>  To decrease player wages, try selling or loaning players that you don't need. Loaning will just take away the pay and you don't receive money from a transfer fee. Selling your players can get you millions of dollars that you may have lost and take quite a bit of money off the payroll.|`|ZWkxKtsdaa	buy cheap young talented players. loan them and then when they get better you can sell them for alot|`|mVTyFeHiaa	put player wages down, sell a few players if u have too many. get a beter sponsorship deal. i dun this nd i get like ￡700,000 each match :)

FXBNO1GTaa	alright i think i see a flaw in this deck ... if you plan on getting a beatdown deck ... then most monsters u would see would for the most part be in face down defense . So therefore ... i would suggest taking out rush recklessly ... 1 lightning vortex ... 1 shrink ... nd adding a nobleman of crossout and cards that make you unable to set .. etc ... take out fissure since u have a smashing already ... and for monsters .. if u want to keep ur lineup of spells .. then i suggest adding 1-2 spear dragon ... and powering that ...  <br>  <br>  a GREAT card for a beatdown deck is the trap ... final attack order ... it prevents any monster from going to defense ... they stay in attack ... which is awesome for your golbin attack force .. spear dragon if u put it in .. which u shud to attack those face down defnese ... etc ... <br>  <br>  i hope i helped.|`|g863rNLJaa	add 2 more bottomless and 3 trap holes and take out giant trunade.|`|d2X4wwiyaa	Nice deck. However I would recommend going to the 40 card minimum.  I would drop cards such as nobleman, axe of despair and fissure.  I would also take out Fighter Lei Lei because of his effect.  I recommend taking out rush reckless since you already have 2 shrinks.  I would also add 2 solemn judgements but try to stay at the 40 card limit.  Hope this helped.|`|gIyBJIgPaa	9/10. <br>  <br>  Good, strong monster and with those magic cards you can really do some damage.

Coronet, through the entrance on the side of Celestic Town. From there, navigate south in the first room of the cave. You should see a Team Galactic member there. Battle and win. Then continue to navigate through until you reach the Sky Pillar. After you finish the event there, you should then go to Valor Lakefront and head east. Keep heading east and you should end up in Sunnyshore City. From there, you can battle the last Gym Leader. Afterward, you should talk to Jasmine in the north of the city, she'll give you the HM for Waterfall. Teach one of your Pokemon Waterfall, and surf north. Keep surfing north until you reach a huge waterfall. Use waterfall and you should be brought to an area where there's a Pokemon Center and the entrance to the Victory Road. Navigate through the Victory Road and you should end up at the entrance of the Elite Four. From there, battle through the Elite Four, beat the Champion, and have fun.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  I hope this helps =D|`|0yeeibcsaa	You use rock climb in that one cave to the right of that one girls grandmas house I think it was celetic town or something like that.<br>  <br>  Hope it helped and heres a tip next up is the legandary pokemon.

54ee904ce0957cabc081644147eab797aa	It depends where you want to gamble, and what time of day.  I haven't heard of anywhere that has $1/hand blackjack tables.<br>  <br>  I live in a suburb of Windsor, ON, home of Caesar's Windsor.  On a weekday morning, you can find $10/hand tables, but normally tables are at $15/hand.  On the weekend, especially on Saturday nights (their busiest time), it'll be difficult to find a table under $25/hand. <br>  <br>  I'm going to Brantford, ON this weekend, and that town has a charity casino.  Definitely not as "classy" as Caesar's, but they do have $5/hand blackjack tables. <br>  <br>  Las Vegas has a wide range of blackjack tables, normally starting at $3/hand.  But because of the selection, you should also be weary of specific table rules that are less than ideal.  For example, some tables pay out 6 to 5 on a blackjack instead of the conventional 3 to 2.

8vSYo9Gqaa	Honestly this should be a given!!<br>  <br>   Where do you think the slimy corporation makes all its money from... the expansions of course!! They will keep making them as long as we keep buying them. They would have to be semi retarded to cease the production of expansions, it would cost them millions and millions of dollars. Its like releasing an entire new game every 6 months without having to come up with a unique and completely new concept, not to mention they dont have to develop a whole new fan base to buy a new game. Its easy money as far as they are concerned, sims fans want every expansion and will pay good money for them all. <br>  <br>  Pets will most certainly be included, considering they are trying to make sims 3 more realistic. Certainly wouldnt be realistic without pets now would it? Not to mention players would complain until they got it anyway. Usually they are pretty good about eventually giving the players what they want. I expect to see similar type sims 2 things in sims 3, but not exact carbon copys, i mean that would be quite boring wouldnt it!! You might as well just go back to playing sims 2 to get the exact same things! <br>  <br>  But don't worry, the best things will eventually be added to sims 3, weather and pets and the like!! In the meantime just enjoy Sims 2 and the fact that there are no more expansions that you have to keep buying, because it certainly gets expensive!!

3jw6WfG7aa	Bandos is the best strength armour, a strength amulet for strength, a neitznot for a helmet, for boots use dragon boots, the best cape for strength is fire cape, but a skill cape is just fine, the best ring is a berserker ring, the best weapon is a godsword but if you want to use a shield use the dragonfire shield and a whip, the best gloves are the "barrow gloves you get from recipe for disaster.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you don't have enough for a bandos chest (it gives +4 strength, you can use a fighter torso which has the same defence as a rune plate, and it gives +4 strength as well)|`|SNACHcceaa	Bandos chest and tassets, dragon boots, zerk ring, fury ammy, zerk helm, lava cape/str cape, for shield id say obby shield ( i havent played in a while... ), best 1h wep id say is abby whip, best 2h is armadyl god sword
lmvG5Sj1aa	If you want to try to sell them have a yard sale.

XxU94aKlaa	I find it hard to go back and play the old Pokemon games simply because I've gotten so use to the Diamond and Pearl style.<br>  I would suggest Fire Red or Leaf Green (pick one, the only difference is a few exclusive Pokes) if you never played the original red and blue. <br>  If you're looking into the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald group I suggest just going for Emerald simply because it has extras Ruby and Sapphire does not and is a more up to date game overall.<br>  Between FR/LG or Emerald I personally would be more likely to chose FR/LG simply because I miss the old games, but arguably Emerald is more up to date.|`|uMyRO93Yaa	Pokemon Emerald is definitely the best choice .

In place of the contest halls in various cities they have put up battle tents to simulate some of the events you will find at the battle frontier. There are still Pokemon contests they have just moved it to one building in Lilycove city.

You can sell anything like clothes, furniture, etc that are placed in your main room. The flea market runs from 6AM - 6AM the next day. The animals that are roaming in your town when you start playing will be the ones that will come into your house. Each animal will come to your house one time, and each time they will buy 3 things. If you still want him/her to buy more things, walk into another room, go back into the main room, and they will buy 3 more things.

I can say that the merchant who comes and sells you guns is a very popular character. We get this question a lot, so we’re definitely going to have him in there in some shape or form. But, we haven’t decided exactly what just yet. As for the weapon upgrade system, again, I cant say anything for definite, but as an online game and a co-op game, I don’t think it would be very good to have the same weapon all the way through the game. So we’re definitely thinking of some style like that. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://gamesblog.ugo.com/index.php/gamesblog/more/resident_evil_5_interview1/" rel="nofollow">http://gamesblog.ugo.com/index.php/games...</a>|`|D5KqI9WCaa	:o|`|SezWmqHxaa	no he is not in the game but jill is as a zombie
fRIsCmUhaa	2- 4 weeks from now. New ranking system, 250 new achievement points, tweaks to reduce laggy matches, If a player quits out of a multiplayer match he is replaced with an insane bot. If the host quits a match he is the only person penalized. The scum that stand-by or use the lag-switch will be banned from playing multiplayer, 2 second recovery time for everyone who gets hit with a smoke grenade, country / region filters to reduce the chance you get matched up with some douche from the UK and either you or him will have a terrible connection to each other. Shield glitch on Pavillion fixed, New shield glitch gone. No more melee or chainsaw out of a roadie run, no more invicible chainsaws.|`|7PwLPWb4aa	The next TU3 is coming either sometime in March or April.  The info on the new update is that the ranking system is going to change and probably new achievements.

Cl8FwsI2aa	Both are good. The Xbox 360 is the better video game console while the PlayStation 3 is better at playing movies since it has a built-in Blu-ray player. The PlayStation 3 also has better games releasing than the Xbox 360. As for online experience, Xbox LIVE blows the PSN out of the water.|`|mzN3hlb9aa	dude get the PS3 but i would get the older one the new ones suck i got mine in 2006 and the new ones just suck you cant play PS2 games on it|`|W2YtVUqKaa	rule of thumb <br>  <br>  If you don't have any friends then you get the PS3 because it's a hardcore gaming machine for the single player. and also god of war 3 is coming only on ps3 too<br>  <br>  if you only have online friends then you get the xbox|`|uPRYwa3zaa	well i'd go with xbox 360, i think it has a better selection of games and i think live is better, but that just me|`|NS3BxXEmaa	ps3 much better then a Xbox 360<br>  The ps3|`|0IWZXeL9aa	PS3 you also get a nice Blu-Ray player....no doubt there are better games and better online play onthe 360 though....The PS3 has gotten a few good games, i.e. Killzone 2.|`|oiHQ0kCkaa	PS3 for sure.<br>  <br>  - Has so many new games coming out for it.<br>  - Already has some amazing platform games such as LittleBigPlanet, Killzone 2, Motorstorm1&2, Resistance 1&2 and more!<br>  - Can hold lots of memory<br>  - Is able to play music, movies, and games<br>  - You can search the internet with it<br>  - Bluetooth compatible ( Mics, keyboards and mouse )<br>  - Has a blu ray built right into it.<br>  - Though may be a bit more expensive ( i think ) its better :)<br>  <br>  Hopefully these points make you choose one!|`|J4wTIhsoaa	it really depends on what you want.

j6MvCr6Naa	Sorry man, Forza Motorsport 2 is exclusive to the Xbox 360.|`|37zTLMT7aa	Yes, i have it for the 360 but it is a great game. However it is a LOT more realistic than those other racing games, so if you don't drive too well, you'll probably end up failing miserably for the first 10 times at least. <br>  <br>  If you like racing SIM's then you'll love it.
BFWlt6uCaa	Ok, When doing ryu's ultra combo instead of pushing the three punch buttons just hit the left bumper because if you look in the button config. menu the 3 punch buttons should be on the left bumper if not, then just change it. <br>  As for bison it means to hold it to the left for 3 secs then right+punch. <br>  Hope this helps lol sorry if i didn't explain well this is my first time using yahoo answers<br>  bye!|`|b7xOZs3Vaa	right, left, right for super kick

8vSYo9Gqaa	The Sims 3 comes to England June, 5 this year! So not to long of a wait left. <br>  <br>  Nobody else has sims 3 yet, and if they say they do its clearly a lie! The only people that have it are the creators, and the only other people who have gotten to try it are the handful of people who got to go to the creators camp a couple months ago, to create some custom content for the game. According to them the game was as awesome as expected!! <br>  <br>  You should visit some sites to brush up on sims 3. You can do pretty much anything in the wonderful world of Sims, thats whats so wonderful, its like life bottled into a game!! - Well not quite, but its the closest thing to simulated life out there. <br>  <br>  Some sites  i recommend you visit are- <br>  Sims2.ea.com- Go and read in the forums about sims 3 and <a href="http://thesims2.co.uk/news.read.asp?id=1080" rel="nofollow">http://thesims2.co.uk/news.read.asp?id=1...</a> - The official sims uk site<br>  or go to <a href="http://thesims3.ea.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thesims3.ea.com/</a> for sims 3 info <br>  and lastly my favorite site is <a href="http://www.snootysims.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.snootysims.com/</a><br>   Hope you find everything you are looking for!|`|24uO1zNRaa	Sometime in July..

M4L3QY3gaa	For Generation II, you may have to wait a while until level 46. that's when it learns Horn Drill. It's an OHKO move that is very powerful...<br>  <br>  But, in GSC i'd rate it a waste of time because Nidoking has a very poor movepool. <br>  <br>  All in all, you can evolve it any time you want before level 23, which is when Nidoking learns the powerful Thrash attack.

YQMCVuFiaa	Obviously, the Elite is going to be better, but really it all boils down to what you're into, or what you're planning on doing with your box.<br>  <br>  Though, for the most part, the only thing that changes per person is how much memory you need ;)|`|AA11570752	the elite is more better cause it has the death ring worked out|`|AA12186403	Well you are wrong the Elite does not have the RROD fixed on it. Microsoft has just announced that they found out the problem to it. So all the systems are still able to have it happen. The 360 normal isnt a bad system if your not an avid gamer. But if you game all the time and plan on getting alot of games and downloading the map packs and stuff then you should get the Elite. With the 120GB hard drive you will have more than enough memory.<br>  <br>  Also if your near a FYI store they have had some great deals on there 360, they just had the Elite for $299 so check around and get the best for your buck.|`|NHYE9q8naa	the elite for sure. it has a 120gb hardrive which is a beast. believe me you'll need the elite with that massive hardrive because you can do so much more like download more content and just having a lot of space for your games.|`|slDXd84saa	well, Xbox Elite is better as it has a 120 GB hardrive.

nrrsG5oiaa	Well, assuming you just lost the discs but have already played it and registered the key #'s and whatnot...<br>  <br>  A few solutions:<br>  <br>  1) buy a new copy of the game from a retailer<br>  2) buy a used copy from eBay or somewhere online since you don't need the registration key<br>  3) *I don't recommend this one since its illegal* download the program from a torrent site <br>  4) borrow the discs from a friend who plays and just install it again<br>  <br>  If you didn't actually use & register the code yet, then I'd say your kinda screwed and just need to buy a new copy of the game.  Amazon has it listed for around $40

AA11905831	Here's how you get to the general store.  When you enter Bowerstone, walk past the bridge atop of you.  Look to your right, and there should be a general store.  Go there, and they should sell your scrolls and much more.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and if you want to know how to get really good really fast, buy the lute.  Then, go in front of someone, open up your expressions with the right bumper, press the top icon, and there should be a green icon there, with the picture of a lute.  Hold the A button on that, and let go on the green.  <br>  <br>  Nice helping you!           <br>  <br>  E|(: ] )>|`|q6uyloYdaa	There is a store in bowerstone where you can buy them.

0yUnnmdJaa	In game, without using any built in phot things, go to where you want to take a picture, and you can press the button on your keyboard: PrtSc, or Print Screen or something similar to take a picture of... the whole screen. You then press the windows button on your keyboard, mine is an icon if MS windows, its next to Ctrl and Alt, you then get out of the game screen but the game is still running in the background, then open paint or a picture editor in which you can crop(slice the picture:read on for understanding) then in the picture editor hold down Ctrl+V  / or you can just go to edit>paste, then if not using paint, find the Crop tool(usually a thickish black line that is showing a right angle like: L  or the other way round) and with the crop tool, crop the picture so its how you want it, or just get rid of the interface ((G)UI - (LOL)) with the crop tool, if in MS Paint then you DONT have a CROP-tool,  but you can still use the selection tool to select the whole picture and delete parts... and blah blah you can work it out. EVENTUALLY Save the file, as the right format, Gif probably, see the requierments for uploading and work it out... paint sucks for giving a pure actual normal gif as i have found in the past.... ahem.. hope this helped. thanks for reading my essay.|`|97nXJF24aa	you need pics first|`|mzN3hlb9aa	take a picture on your camera and upload on your computer like a simpleton|`|XxU94aKlaa	On your keyboard you should see a button that says "print screen" (it's generally on the right neat the delete, home, page up/down, and other such buttons)<br>  Click that, open a visual program of some sort (paint shop, or what ever you have) and click to paste the image (Ctrl + V). The picture that was up at the time of hitting print screen should be pasted.<br>  Another more complex option is basically using the in game video recorder and taking a single image out of that (you could technically use the print screen method on the video, or break up the video into so many frames and choose a single image).

dDR4RGrbaa	The exact same thing happened to me! I forgot my birthday because I was only 11 when I made my account, then I tried to log back on a few months ago to check back on things and it was asking for my bday. I very kindly sent them in an email asking if they could give me my birthday, then they emailed me back saying my account was "frozen for participating in cyber sex???" wtf is that bs?? I would NEVER do that! So then, I looked up my account and it's not even frozen!!! See for yourself, look up horse_girl_79! So, don't do what I did. Don't bother sending them an email. I guess you're out of luck like me.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Omg! taifallos, THANK YOU! I did what you suggested with getting your neofriend to check your age, and IT ACTUALLY WORKED. It said I was 26 years old and I just put in my actual birthday with the year as 1982, and it worked. You don't know how long I've wanted to get my account back lol!|`|S4sIDiU7aa	I know right!? I'm onaria_ria, 7yrs and going, but unfortunately I can no longer bypass the birthday request when logging in. I sent them an email and filled out one of their forms but when I received an email back I was told that my account was frozen. Ummm... what? I don't think so!- This really peeved me because I've worked so hard at this account. Anyways, my new account is isaisnautilus (your welcome to add me) I was thinking of starting up a neopet lost account support group on neopets.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately after all my searching and questing for the answer, it seems all you can do is guess 3 different months/days/year every day. Time consuming?-very! But this is all I have for now. If anyone else has a better idea I'd love to know. Try to remember when you signed up, what was your favourite month or day when you first joined? Some people know that there's certain months that for whatever reason they just don't use even when filling out false/temp info. The date itself might be a number you're partial to. Some people have suggested that if you have a friend who's also your neofriend ask them what your birthday is listed as on the neopets site. (apparently only neofriends can view this info). Then they can report this back to you, and if they can't see the birthday, hopefully they can see your age and at least tell you that so you know what year you put your birthday down as.<br>  <br>  It does say on your profile though that you were last seen 1 day ago, so what happened between then and now? Maybe try logging in on a comp with a different ip address, I've been told that it doesn't always request a birthday that way.<br>  <br>  Good luck! More power to ya! I hope you find it soon!|`|OrFu77k3aa	Buy cheap neopoints at <a href="http://www.turmaculus.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.turmaculus.com</a>

The purpose of recruiting a friend is to get new people to try it out.<br>  <br>  But, Secondly, I looked it up on their site and it doesn't appear that you can recruit an inactive account and still get the same benefits: <br>  <br>  "Does this promotion only apply to new subscribers? Can I recruit someone using a Scroll of Resurrection?<br>  <br>  This promotion is valid only for those accounts referred and created after 08/05/08 and via an Authentication Key sent through a Recruit-a-Friend invitation email.

XxU94aKlaa	Depends on the games you like as to which is better really.<br>  I tend to play my 360 more personally simply as it has more games that appeal to me and the system is in a more convent location of my home.<br>  The Wii has some wonderful games, is great when I want some extra movement, and can not be beat when you have friends over to play games. Though really at the end of the day I generally want my games to be more lazy than the wii allows (yay button mashing!).

You get to interact with the game it isn't just button pushing, even though with Wii you can make it just button pushing. <br>  <br>  If you're looking at buying a system then I suggest Wii, you can buy Wii points and buy older games and have them downloaded onto your Wii wirelessly via Internet. It's an amazing system. There's going to be a new Final Fantasy coming out soon for the DS and the Wii where you can hook up your DS to the Wii and play against each other.|`|78QTdcBlaa	If you're talking about the original Xbox, get the Wii. If you're talkin about the 360 and the Wii, get the 360.<br>  Reasons why the 360 is better than the wii.<br>  1. The 360 has way better graphics.<br>  2. The 360 has acheivements.<br>  3. The 360 can do more moves, like in Call of Duty for Wii, it is short on some buttons.<br>  4. The 360 has more games.<br>  So the 360 is better than the Wii. That's my opionion.|`|qlgsyv2Laa	Well i have both system's but i like Xbox better because there is more games and with the fighting games you can use a controller instead of looking like a idiot in front of the tv screen trying to fight.

vFF23pQjaa	In the first Monster Hunter Freedom, there is a glitch in the Garuga mission that will significantly weaken it. All you need to do is trade a Spiderweb to the Veggie Elder during the mission. I can't remember all the details on how weak the Garuga will become, but it is a LOT weaker after this glitch is implemented. You can get large monster bones by killing lower class large monsters like Gravios and Diablos. You get monster bone + when you kill hard class large monsters and hard monster bones when you kill G class large monsters. To get Electro sacs, kill a Khezu. To get pure crystals, you need either upgrade you farm by increasing you Hunter Rank or ore at the Volcano or Swamp zones in Hard Class quests. If this doesn't help you can check out the Monster Hunter Wiki.

lP2dN2U9aa	Wow, runescape, haha it's been a while since i last played.<br>  <br>  Ok at your level i would reccomend fighting giant rats and goblins around lumbridge/draynor. don't bother picking up the drops unless you want to get cooking and prayer levels up. (by burying the bones and cooking the meat)<br>  <br>  In order to get your magic level up i suggest you use air strike on chickens untill you can afford to use more efficient spells, for example alchemy. alot of people will be offering you more expensive ideas but at your level this is your best option.<br>  <br>  to get your agility up im afriad you'll need a members account, in which case you can run around the gnome agility course untill your satisfied with your level.<br>  <br>  to get your strength up you will need to use the stregnth option in your attack mode, simply hover your mouse over the 3 or 4 modes to see what exp they give. if you can't find the modes just click on the two crossed swords to the left of your inventory/stats tabs.<br>  <br>  Good luck :D|`|tX71oIplaa	Well to your strength looks fine but to increase your str depends on which form of attack you do. Each weapon has 3 types of attack which all correspond the 3 combat stats (attk, str and def). Choose the stat you want to work on and switch to that attack style. I think the button is located at the top left of your inventory space. to get your magic skill up you must perform spells such as wind strike. So you must get a lot of runes if you want to increase your magic. Agility is a membership skill therefore you must pay real money. But to increase it you must go to obstacle courses located through out R.S after completing the courses you get your agility exp. Fishing is all located near the water if you see a sparkling in the water thats where u can fish for certain things. Fletching is bow and arrow making.|`|37d6ehdUaa	For you magic level i'd go to Fist of Guthix mini-game (located in wilderness but once you get there no danger), because you can use the runes supplied to train your level with no cost to yourself.

ysiE6IDjaa	There is nothing wrong. The game is designed like that. Sims will return home at the same time they left when returning from the business. Time does not pass in lots you are not playing.<br>  <br>  Imagine what would happen if time did pass on lots you weren't playing. You would go to visit a lot that you hadn't played for a couple of Sim weeks and find all your Sims dead from old age!

EUaIGX0Gaa	Sora, Donald and Goofy travel down a long road that meanders through endless fields, and come to a crossroads. As Sora stands in the crossroads, he gazes up at the night sky and thinks of his lost friends. Just then, a mysterious man approaches from down one of the branching paths. "Ahead lies something you need," he says, "but to claim it, you must lose something dear." The man vanishes before a single path, leading to a castle that eerily resembles a girl's drawing... In the coming journey, what will Sora and his companions gain, and what will they lose? In addition to Sora, players can control Riku in this adventure that bridges the gap between KINGDOM HEARTS and KINGDOM HEARTS II A full 3D remake of the original GBA release, KINGDOM HEARTS Re:Chain of Memories offers a refreshing rendition of the hit title for the PlayStation 2 system.

afJz77pjaa	Beneath the Ashes would make more sense if you finished the game first, but I don't think you HAVE to finish the game to download and play it. And Lara's Shadow doesn't come out until Christmas time, possibly next year.
ngtNT23Xaa	It's not available in Multiplayer, but you can activate it by pressing start, and turning the skull on that implemets it.
yLCo7Ntsaa	Are you downloading the file from the official website? You probably need a very large disk because the installation is actually composed of 5 disk. If this doesn't work, then you probably have to go to the store and buy it.

In euros or dollars?<br>  The 20GB is no longer made but can be found online still for about $60.<br>  The 60GB runs about $90.<br>  The 60GB Live starter kit runs about $105.<br>  The 120GB runs about $140.|`|PdfvF104aa	60 pounds|`|KmIfVCj9aa	It depends on the size you want:<br>  A 20GB one from amazon is about ￡35 <br>  A120GB one from play.com is about ￡70|`|UVdRnx8Faa	Cost around 100 dollars was how much I got mine for and it is perfect.|`|MFxZLuChaa	Roughly about ￡60, go to Play.com as its pretty cheap and postage is always free and quick!

njdbtnvwaa	When you say it blocks...what do you mean exactly?<br>  There could be a number of problems. Please make sure you actually have the disc in, or mounted properly. Go to My Computer and make sure you see the disc in the drive there. <br>  <br>  If you are getting an error from some kind of outside problem like a anti-virus or something like that, just disable it. <br>  <br>  If those don't seem to be the problem, try unistalling it. Go to My Computer, Add/Remove Programs, and find it on the list. Uninstall it and just try again.
tjbEKSjSaa	if you like strategies yes you should if you don't just save your money to buy Halo 3 ODST . but there are some achievements in Halo wars that will make it so you can get a very cool set of armor in Halo 3 ODST and it is not the recon armor , that is what game informer magazine said.|`|faeGZvZeaa	I would not say yes or no, but it is a whole lot different from halo 3. To me, it feels more like a PC game than a console game.|`|6GIrW5eWaa	If the demo is still available I would suggest playing that before ordering. If you are not familiar with RTS and you are only buying it to get the mythic maps as well I would say be patient 4/7 will be here before you know it and you will not have to spend the addition $$$ to find out you don't like RTS. Just my opinion good luck|`|HiU8pyfjaa	First get the demo<br>  if u have halo 3 and cant wait anymore for the mythic map packs buy it<br>  but u dont shoot anything just command RTS|`|obKSk23aaa	I'm not. Console RTS isn't very fun to me.
U9LDqPdMaa	I like Super Mario Galaxy, but I also have Super Smash Bros.

up6I8etaaa	Ooh... this is a toughie.  Mario Kart DS is probably the best, but I thought the gamecube one was pretty good.<br>  <br>  For Zelda, it feels like everyone is good!  The old 2D RPG's are fun, the newer cartoony ones (wind waker, phantom hourglass) are fun, and all of the 3D ones are classics (ocarina of time, majora's mask, twilight princess).  Ocarina of Time is the best, but I think Twilight Princess is awesome because of the graphics, gameplay, the controls, and FREEDOM!!!<br>  <br>  My favorite super mario game is Galaxy, but for it's time, 64 and super mario bros. are the bomb.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|30nfKtMhaa	My favourite Zelda game is: Zelda Ocarnia of Time. (N64 & Wii) I loved that game! The songs were great and have been featured in to many other games like Super Smash Bros Brawl. I like the "Song of Storms" in that game. I  like the song "Gerudo Valley", the "Market Square" song and many more from Zelda Ocarnia of Time.<br>  <br>  My favourite Super Mario games will have to be: Super Mario 64 (N64) and Super Mario Galaxy (Wii). This is because "Super Mario 64" was my first video game when I was young. <br>  <br>  I like the Mario Kart game for Wii as well. I also liked the N64 Mario Kart game =p<br>  <br>  I love Mario games And Zelda games =]<br>  <br>  Lol =P<br>  <br>  The Nintendo 64 games were classics!|`|stJR9uR0aa	Favorite mario kart would be: mario kart wii, because the steering wheel has amazing controls.. Favorite Zelda would be: Legend of Zelda and the Ocrania of Time, because of the amazing graphics, great storyline, and a pretty good sound track. Favorite mario game would be: Super Mario 64 or Super Mario Galaxy, they both great games i just can't decide between them.<br>  <br>  -aRoN|`|tX71oIplaa	Mariokart wii is fun because of its online capabilities.<br>  <br>  Legend of zelda Orcarina of time and major's mask are both amazing games.<br>  <br>  I agree super mario galaxy is a good super mario 64 remake.|`|0orf8HJIaa	mario kart the original for n64<br>  zelda ocarina of time<br>  super mario 64|`|27278449ec41d2bc430d6b609b7a5445aa	Mario Kart Wii my only let down on it was that there was no Petey Piranha. Other than that the online play and all the unlockables fun game.<br>  <br>  The Legend Of Zelda Wind Waker- I may be the only person to like this but meh it's fun and cute game.<br>  <br>  Super Mario Brothers 3. Nothing will ever beat this timeless classic. Almost 20 years later and I'm STILL playing it ^_^|`|exZGdQBRaa	mario cart double dash ftw

The car you are driving will go directly to the bottom of the water and keep going without losing any health.

There were many reasons to this. In my opinion Metro looks a bit better then Antagonist and suits and outfit and hat fine. Plus if you only plan on getting a hair coupon with your Nx/Maple points or if you don't plan to have Nx clothing for the rest of your days playing then get Metro. This is because at the very start of the game, there is an hair quest (Amoria.) This hair quest gives Antagonist but NOT Metro. So if you get Metro, the people will know you had NX before. If you get Antagonist, people might think that you got it from the hair quest. So go with Metro!<br>  <br>  ~Happing Mapling|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Sorry I don't know that game
tD6LXTAOaa	COD 4 was brilliant, if i say do myself.....it was new, different, and fun! But COD 5.......oh my god what a lump of ****! I bought it thinking, this is gonna own like 4, it didn't. They basically got COD 4, gave it worse weapons, worse campaign, worse maps, added in Nazi Zombies, which quickly gets boring......and called it Call of Duty 5. It is so laughably the same as 4......my first game online, i came 4th, because it was EXACTLY - THE - SAME. I mean it, everything is worse, the storyline has no real twists and basically all you do is; kill people, walk, kill people, walk, kill people etc. The weapons i hate. Nazi Zombies is fun at first but it just gets annoying. It won game of the year because of biased fanboys.<br>  <br>  You want a real game?, get Killzone2.(or gears if you aren't lucky enough to have a PS3).|`|d1zz0Afwaa	If everyone else likes it then surely they have a reason.|`|pK708QPOaa	It's personal preference... I liked both COD games. Call of Duty: World at War had an awesome thing after you beat the game, it unlocks a nazi zombie mode. I don't really agree with you about having bad graphics, sound, and game play.. I thought they were excellent. I liked Bad Company too though and agree with you... awesome game.

i7ZArzliaa	Hands down the Tekken series is better. SC, like Tk, is a Namco product, but I feel it's like the younger brother who rides the coat-tails of its more successful older sibling. There's a reason why the Tekken series has been a top 3D fighting game franchise for the past 15 years (only comparable by Sega's Virtua Fighter)...<br>  <br>  The Tekken series has a rich history and storyline. It is also a much faster paced game with more game-play depth. In the Tekken series, I believe the games focus more on drawing out all the aspects of a player's strategies, techniques, and his/her skill in reading the play on-the-fly... not just purely on player reaction time and button mashing.<br>  <br>  Moreover, the Tekken series now boasts an unparalleled 42 playable characters in "Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion"... that's all in one game, leaving a lot of room for the player to enjoy a myriad of character choices and combinations, while also showcasing a learning curve that reinforces the game's replayability.<br>  <br>  Lastly, in the gaming industry, the prosperity of a fighting game series is not only dependent on the home TV consoles... but can also be gauged by its successful opens in game-centers world-wide. Personally, I think of it like blockbuster movies hitting the big screen compared to B-rated films that are released straight onto DVD. Tk6:BR just debuted this past December (2008) in Japan, about 1 year after its predecessor Tk6 in international arcades... SC's last arcade appearance was SC3, about 4 years ago in 2005...<br>  <br>  SC does use a myriad of weapons, which is the one point that it has over Tk, but for a serious gamer willing to spend the time and effort to train a fighting-game character, I would definitely go with Tekken.<br>  <br>  Well, just my thoughts~ *sound of 2 pennies hitting the table*<br>  <br>  Offnote to all original posters: It would be much appreciated if you chose a Best Answer to your question when you feel you've gotten it... even if it is not mine... many people spend a lot of time honestly researching and typing an answer, but sadly, most of them never even receive a simple "Thanks".

JwT2GfF9aa	In my personal opinion, the team is somewhat lackluster.  You have two water pokemon on your team, and most of your pokemon are offensive pokemon.  Also, this might sound scary, but over the years, I've seen too many mewtwo and tyranitar teams getting rip into shreds by one pokemon - HERACROSS.  This is because heracross is a bug/fighting which takes out psychic and dark.  <br>  <br>  Overall though, you might win some friendly battles, but not real serious players because of your choice type.  <br>  Here's how it goes:<br>  Blastoise, Charizard, and Polywrath can beaten by an electric pokemon like electavire<br>  Mewtwo, Tyranitar, and Venasaur  can be beaten by a bug type pokemon heracross<br>  <br>  even though you might take both of these pokemon down, your team might be down to only 2 pokemon while the opponent has 4.|`|s4psKJrPaa	youve gotta be a total nerd if your 13+ and play with pokemon.....dork.|`|aaqKW3pRaa	Depends on what game it is.

4He3bNO7aa	You need to be a bit more specific. Dog or a Furry who is like a dog?<br>  <br>  Dog avatars can be found all over SL. Personally, I thing the best is a Japanese-made one of a beagle at a place called Happy Mood, but it costs 2000L. You could also try a place called Grendel's Children, where avatars are much cheaper. I can't say I've actually seen a dog avie there, but I've never looked specifically for one. But it's a big place and it does have a large section of animal avatars - some very low-priced. I got an ant avatar for L$1 there just to (no pun intended) bug my friends. Hey for L$1, you can't go wrong and it is funny.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a furry avatar, it's harder for me to help you, but I do remember one place called Kitsune. I went there a long time ago to buy an English/Japanese translator and the place sold a variety of furry and animal avatars. Try searching for that place as well.<br>  <br>  I'm betting though, is that as soon as you see the Beagle at Happy Mood, you'll want that. It's very cute.|`|A3WSl24Yaa	collect some bones and save them until u die. before u die right in ur will to bury them with u when u die

N5e3xenWaa	Anyone who can claim that any first person shooter isn't "Run'n'gun" is out of their mind of course thats what this game is and thats how FPS games are defined. <br>  Tip#1 Spawn at the back of the map. I know it may take longer to run up but this gives you a fresh perspective on the battle and you aren't immediately getting shot in the back. <br>  #2 Do not sprint if you turn a corner and see an enemy while sprinting you may as well consider it a death. Do not sprint especially indoors as this will increase your advantage over someone who is.<br>  #3 Throw your hand grenades, because everyone thinks this is a "Tactical" shooter they hide around corners and in their spawn, throw your nades through doorways where the enemy is surely hiding.<br>  Follow these tips and develop your own strategy around them.|`|p2BUNHTdaa	well for me, in everygame i have always been a sniper first player so i wasn't doin too well with the rifle either until i unlocked the sniper. Maybe you're just meant to be a sniper if you like to lay back and stay afar. <br>  <br>  And i disagree about this game not being a run n gun type of game. except in a few maps most can be suited to play w/ run n gun style. this is the fastest way to level up, allthough not the best way to get k/d ratio. <br>  <br>  so anyways with a rifle i find it better not scoping, but rather firing from the hip. but then again i might just not be good w/ it. But like i said earlier, try and get to scout and see if u prefer sniping if you like attacking from far. I've improved by k/d ratio by .67 since unlocking the scout. Going for 2kdr by end of the week|`|ZDv2oQluaa	I think he meant find cover by ducking behind objects not sticking to them like the single player game. Shooting from a far can be a good tactic just don't stay in one spot for too long or the killed will hunt you down. When re spawning try using the camera view to look for campers that might attack when you appear or join a squad and re spawn to the leader.|`|AA11328192	It seems like your not taking cover. Killzone 2 is not a game that u just run around and shoot everyone. Its a tatical shooter. Take some cover and duck with L2. Or u can find a good hiding spot in a corner where a lot of enemies come through. Also try to throw grenades at your eniemes. That would stun them for some seconds and get in cover.

ef31622afe2e22cbfa13414f8bbb6b0caa	Only 8 chao can be in one garden. If you bring a chao into an already full garden, 1 chao will be moved to another. If you have only 2 of the 3 gardens, and both of those gardens are full, don't buy another egg. A chao will get pushed out into the garden that you still down have and you won't be able to raise it. That's how I thought I lost two of my chao years ago, and they were a couple of my oldest.

"If there is one downside to worshipping shadows and darkness its that we have to take our tea without milk."<br>  <br>  2. There are many conflicting legends as to whether or not the Hero of Oakvale killed the Guildmaster.

66AZhLnEaa	Call of Duty 4:Modern Warfare. It is my favorite game. It has amazing online play and it was voted game of the year. Although there are some other great fps games such as Call of Duty: World at War, which has a zombie mode if you beat the game, Resistance 1& 2. But my favorite is COD4. Its totally your choice though|`|7fZ6tpuBaa	stranglehold is a quality run and gun but not in first person.

For bruno, use venusaur on his onix's and pidgeot and kadabra on the rest (watch out for pidgeot, his pokemon know rock tomb). For Agatha, ust kadabra(they are all waek against psychic moves). For Lance, use lapras and snorlax because they both know ice beam which is super effective against all his pokemon. Finally, for your rival, use riachu for pidgeot, charizard, and gyrados. Use lapras and snorlax on exegutor.

It's absolutely HUGE! If you're a fan of games like Fallout 1,2, or 3, or large RPG games, this is definitely a good one to pick up.

IExYJjeoaa	Okay,  you start off my choosing a number of cards that you want to play.   lets say 20.   everyone gets 20 cards,  and you lay them face down and you do not look at them.  you also get a hand of i think 5 or 7 cards,   and the rest of the cards go in the middle.   you then make 4 piles around the middle using your hand  (and you flip the first card on top of your deck of 20 face up on top of your deck,  the goal is to try and get rid of your 20 cards,  each time you use one, you flip the next one up.   at the start of each of your turns,  you draw cars till you have 5 total in your hand.   and you also have to discard at the end of every turn,    you make 4 discard piles next to your pile of 20,  and after you have 4 down,  you then start to over lap them,   at anytime you can use the very end cards of your discard piles as if they were in your hand,  but just the last ones,  you cant use a card thats covered up by another card.       <br>  <br>  the piles around the deck must go      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,  ect.    and skip bos are used as anything,<br>  i hope this helps.  <br>  it's pretty complicated

rAWUCB1eaa	i say if you are a big fan of gta iv, yeah it's worth it.  It contains at least ten hours of new game content, and new weapons/gametypes for multiplayer. If you aren't a big fan of gta iv, wait for the price to go down, because you could get bored of it easily. People think other shooters like Call of duty, gears, and halo is better.

So that isn't the problem.   GW also runs just fine on Vista, so it may be something specific with the laptop.  I'd recommend e-mailing support and giving them the specs for your laptop and the error message you are getting.  They can probably help.

b3b268bd86d730469f543b3c4b321e88aa	It looks pretty good, but you can check up more on serebii.net for additional info, and what is needed to continue growing them good and get better
7p9wmL8Yaa	It's probably just a flea. Instead of pressing A, just swing your net at it. The townie will thank you for it too! :)
7p9wmL8Yaa	You can get skins that show characters from your favorite game, plus cool stylus's too! :)|`|Hhd2TPL2aa	There are many different types of cool covers to keep your case from getting dirty|`|EgFAOcgoaa	pouch for your nds <br>  screen protectors<br>  game cases<br>  stylus case etc
SP1ZpEiuaa	Out of those 3, id get Call of Duty WaW. The graphics are great, the story mode is awesome, and online play is some of the best ive seen. Plus, nazi zombies is on it and 3 new multiplayer maps and 1 new nazi zombie map will be out on monday. So I reccomend that. I also recommend Fallout 3. It is by far one of the greatest games ever. It is a FPS (First Person Shooter) and you decide your guys own fate. You can like anybody you want, kill anybody you want, and do almost anything all in one game. the only downside however is no multiplayer but it is still very good. So I recommend Fallout 3 and/or Call of Duty WaW.|`|aaqKW3pRaa	If you are really good at Xbox games get Call of duty. It takes a lot of skill.|`|LyJaMD5xaa	Gears of war
7AdXFnedaa	well i wouldnt say no right away. remeber game stop held a campaigne saaying "bring in your GBA or SP and get like 70 bucks nocked off a DS lite". they may hold this event again im not to sure it would be awesome cause i could get a new DSi and all. as for right now it doesnt look like you can just wait till it comes out and stores start thinking of ways to sell the new product|`|lpKlfC8Vaa	Nope. I think you can trade in to Game Stop or a video game store for store credit. Then you could use that credit towards a DSi|`|l5opEF8Zaa	Nope.|`|2MsOTVSVaa	I traded my PSP 2000 toward the Nintendo DSi and therefore I was able to lower the price of the DSi itself.

b3b268bd86d730469f543b3c4b321e88aa	check gamefaqs.com or gamespot.com; preferable gamespot if you want to get a list of psp games that are currently available and have good rating
hvEnC8iYaa	I'd suggest:<br>  <br>  Final Fantasy X<br>  Final Fantasy XII<br>  Gran Theft Auto: San Andreas|`|EL45UeUJaa	Yeah Ratchet and Clank and Jak and Daxter are great :D<br>  I enjoy games like Kingdom hearts, Medal of Honor and Hack :D|`|7AdXFnedaa	have you ever played jak and daxter? the first one is a little kidish the second one its a pain but you get to just own anyone you want GTA style while exploring a huge map. you can also transform into a beat at will sometimes. and jak 3 is GTA styled again just more weapons more attacks and a new form plus a new map and new vehicls to take out new enimes
j6MvCr6Naa	It's because the universe is taking its revenge on you for making multiple accounts and ruining it for new players to the game and everybody in between.
bSIsPN6gaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  No. Just kidding. Buy it, cheapskate.
R5nwTe2Iaa	Chaos Black isn't a real pokémon game. It's a hack version, which means it will be unpredictable in terms of reliability.
l5opEF8Zaa	No. Although, there is a prototype 160 dollar DSi flashcard out for sale.....in Japan....with no refund...or customer support....or a FAQ...
AA11070360	Like with any battery operated systems (cell phones, i pods or gameboys) the batteries should only be charged when they are completely life less, and should always be charged off, and all the way. Fact. batteries have memory.  lets say  you only charge the battery 50%  the next time you go to charge even if you leave it plugged in to charge 100% of the way, chances are it will only charge 50%.|`|7AdXFnedaa	i put mine on the charger once i seen the red light hit. heck i do it with my ds now days old habits XD. but in hnset opinion it when ever you want to charge it and i did that for a couple of years with my SP and i didnt have any problem with the battery life

tX71oIplaa	World of warcraft is basically an online rpg (role-playing game). Like most rpg's then point of the game is to level get better equipment and try to reach the highest level possible by grinding (killing monsters over and over) or quests. The reason WoW is such a popular game because it has a wide variety of classes such as warlock, rogue etc. as well the range in skills and the ability for the player to customize their character to try and be the strongest. In addition, it has one the largest maps in the rpg world so it will be likely that you'll discover new areas every day. If you plan on getting the game i offer an opinion. If you have many real life friends who play this game it is a very fun experience if you can play with them online. However, if you don't have many that play WoW you will usually find yourself bored. Thats what happened to me when my friends quit. But its all up to you. Good luck.|`|zHRFHO93aa	Warcraft is a MMORPG or Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game that over 10 million people play via their PC's.  You pay a monthly subscription to the games owner Blizzard and in return you can log in to the 'game world' as much as you want, for as long as you want.  The game is set in a fantasy world and you fight both other real players and computer generated ones too.<br>  <br>  The point of the game ultimately is just to have fun, meet new people, make friends and 'level up' - to become stronger and acquire new spells, weapons, armour etc as you progress through the game.  It's an awesome game, in my view the best of its kind and its definitely worth a try if your thinking whether it's worth it.  It is time-consuming and it's also easy to get addicted to lol, as I did for a while.  So much fun though is unreal.  They offer a free trial 10 day trial too.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|A4EQUBKEaa	WoW is the best MMORPG.A lot of people are playing this game.You can't miss it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.YehforGames.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.YehforGames.com</a><br>  Yeh! for Games, Inc. is an American company that helps you get levels and PvP gear on World of Warcraft.<br>  1.

The main objective of the game is to gain levels (the highest currently is level 80) and complete quests. In my opinion, the game, while rather expensive at around $80-$100 for the game and both expansions and $14.99 per month (in the U.S. at least), is worth the price and is very good. There is something for everyone in the game, players can fight other players, players can just play the game alone, and players can also do more difficult things with a group. The last time I read something on it, each player could have a grand total of 59 characters per account, and 10 characters per server. There are a number of different classes as well. There are also Role-Playing servers for those that like to follow the games deep lore. There are also different holidays that a player can participate in, as well as world events that are very fun. Since I really do not wish to waste the entire page, here's the URL of the page that covers some of the main things of World of Warcraft (the links to different articles start at the middle of the page): <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/</a>|`|iNcH3Om1aa	World of Warcraft is MMORPG that costs 15.99 a month. You get to choose your class, race, and whether you want to be on the Alliance (good) or Horde (bad). You go around doing quests, fighting monsters, and other stuff. You really should get the game, it comes w/ a 14 day free trial, after that you have to pay.|`|goA7HnSsaa	Basically like everyone here has said its a MMORPG. But its also a fun experience (if you like gaming) to keep it short and simple. You level up your own customizable character and collect items and defeat monsters.<br>  Its great :D
ysiE6IDjaa	I wonder if you are playing with the boolprop testing cheats on. If so, don't. Turn then off by entering boolProp testingCheatsEnabled false and don't use them unless it is for a specific purpose...and always turn them straight off afterwards or they can corrupt your game. <br>  You can then select the toddler as the other answerer said to see if the 'grow up' option is there, or else buy the birthday cake and carry her to it.<br>  <br>  Edit: enter the cheat 'moveObjects on'. Delete your toddler. Save and exit the lot. When you re-enter the lot she will be sitting or crawling by the mailbox and you should be able to play her normally.Then buy the birthday cake if the 'grow up' option still isn't there.|`|JSx9PZdiaa	Try clicking on the child. Does it say "Grow Up"? If it does click that. Hope this helps!|`|S2dzWHTKaa	Well there is a cheat.. you press control, shift, c all at the same time, and a box will pop up. type in  boolProp testingcheatsenabled true and then enter. save and go into the neighborhood, and then go back in the house. Right click the  toddler and if you can see it press set to birthday. I hope that helps..!|`|BdyuJBTVaa	Well maybe he/she isnt old enough yet they range from 4-6

C8DOT8Y7aa	Sorry I don't know that game
3q6Gzfw7aa	find the cacao in Douala
mg2BJbeAaa	Kind of difficult to understand your problem.<br>  Has the e-mail address for your account always gone to your father? You'd have to request an e-mail address change and have access to both in order for it to be changed.<br>  The only way to have gotten your account hacked is to clicked on an ad, spam, or phish site. Always look at what you are clicking on, downloading, or linking to. Anti-virus software can't prevent stupidity.<br>  There really isn't a way to "close" and account. As long as you keep paying for it, Blizzard will let you use it. Otherwise, it's frozen. Now, if you were banned for not following the Terms of Service, that's a different story. No luck, as banned accounts are gone for good.<br>  I recommend that you just get a new account. Just buy a prepaid card too, so no credit cards are involved. There is also an anti-hack device you can purchase at GameStop or similar stores. It generates a random number attuned to your account. The only way to access your account would be to know your password and the random number.
ysiE6IDjaa	I had this problem with a custom pool I downloaded...in my case it was something to do with having Seasons and having a pool that was built by someone who didn't have Seasons. Anyway it's fairly easy to fix, just use the cheat moveObjects on and delete your Sims. Save and restart and your Sims will be standing normally by the letterbox. To be on the safe side delete the pool if it was a custom pool and build your own. If you weren't using a custom pool make sure you patch your game.|`|612e94c5c73b26b5e7ba3a55f32b7155aa	do your other sims do the same or just that one?<br>  If its just the one its a glitch and may be irriversable <br>  Your only hope is to save, and restart, if that doesn't work,<br>  The only other thing that Should work is if you move him out of the lot and then move him back in, as it should reset all the animations|`|IEg96ORWaa	Hmmm, sounds like a glitch. Try installing it again.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  :)|`|VjGrt5Lxaa	JUST SAVE AND RESTART MAYBE YOUR CD IS SCRATCHED........

The site has charts, new releases etc so it should give you some ideas of whats new and fresh.|`|aOFdtoR4aa	100% HERE...|`|INLkuy4iaa	Some says torrent or Limewire but I don't because sometimes it brought me virus. That was scary. So I suggest you <a href="http://hobbylazy.com" rel="nofollow">http://hobbylazy.com</a> , one of the best site of my favorite sites. I suggest this one because it is very easy to use and download music for completely free. This site is virus and spam free. No need any risky software like Limewire and whatsoever. Another reason to suggest is because there are many many latest songs out there, like 50 Cent, Eminem, Kelly Clarkson, Jonas Brother, Charlie Wilson, The Fray, Bruce, T.I., Beyonce, Britney, Pink, Taylor Swift, Sugarland, Ne-yo, Justin, Britney, Beyonce, Pink, Coldplay Akon, Take That, and many more. If you want find more, you can simply type your keyword in the search box of the website or click on See All Albums to browse all the available albums. Those songs are completely downloadable. Please check out and have fun.

A friend of mine who in real life works at a major tower in the US thought it would be cool to be a radar controller and me a real life radar controller thought it would be cool to team up and try my hand at local in a tower. On my scope  (and believe me being a radar guy, I was lost in the virtual cab and always had that sucker in view) it didn't matter the squawk, they always tagged up with their callsigns.

I would just suggest that there are a lot of scientific advancements going on, and with a murder, there will probably be a lot of smart people trying to solve it.  I don't know anything about how to murder people without getting caught, and have no need to know this - but I suspect it is difficult to do and if you make even the slightest mistake they will catch you - if not now, perhaps 10 years from now - then you'll be in jail for life.<br>  <br>  For a lesser crime like a burglary (victim isn't home, no weapons involved), unless the person you steal from is important, the police will probably be too busy eating donuts and giving out parking tickets (and in Chicago, taking bribes) to want to bother with it - especially if they are anything like the NYPD in New York.  But if you kill someone, I think the police will have to leave the donut shop and try to solve it.  Since murder rates have been low in recent years, they will have a lot more resources to investigate each murder.

Jbkk7NrJaa	Accessing Vault 87<br>  <br>  Vault 87 can only be accessed through Little Lamplight. At the appropriate time in the game, the player will have the option of questioning mayor MacCready about how to access Vault 87. The mayor will suggest taking Murder Pass. However, he will also inform the player that there is a broken computer terminal in Little Lamplight that will allow direct access to the vault via a different, safer route.<br>  <br>  To access the terminal, the player must speak to Joseph (Fallout 3), (as directed by the mayor). Joseph can fix the broken terminal, allowing it to be hacked, but he will only do so if the player has rescued Penny from Paradise Falls, or if the player has a high enough science or persuasion skill. Joseph can be found in the Little Lamplight schoolhouse in the morning. The player must have 50 (average) Science skill to actually hack the computer to get into the vault.<br>  <br>  If Penny is not rescued, or if Joseph becomes upset through dialogue, entrance through Murder Pass will be the only option to get to Vault 87. Murder Pass houses several super mutants armed with heavy weaponry like missile launchers and miniguns. Murder Pass is a good choice for earning experience, which is north of the souvenir building. Mayor MacCready will open the gate for you if asked.<br>  edit Traveling Through the Vault<br>  <br>  Once inside the vault, the player will encounter super mutants, super mutant masters and several super mutant brutes.<br>  <br>  Eventually, the player will encounter a friendly super mutant named Fawkes, who was sealed in a test chamber and left there decades before. Fawkes, via the intercom, will offer his services in acquiring the G.E.C.K in return for freedom. The player need not free Fawkes, but the super mutant will indeed honor this bargain, and will help the player acquire the G.E.C.K., serving as a guide, pulverizing any enemies in the meantime, and finally, retrieving the device itself from its highly irradiated resting place.<br>  <br>  If you are stealthy, you can overhear a scripted conversation between the first two super mutants encountered in the facility.<br>  # SM1: We almost out of green stuff. Others go to find some. We must have more of us to stop the humans!<br>  # SM2: Need to find more humans then... make them like us.<br>  # SM1: Stupid Fawkes (sic) say men will come to us one day.

xRimEBNgaa	Wow, your mom's not being a mom and that's not fair to you. The national problem gamblers helpline (800.522.4700) may have local resources, but I also would suggest talking with a trusted adult because it may take that before she's willing to cooperate with treatment. Gambling has a focusing effect for compulsives that essentially puts them in a trance, so what your describing isn't so unusual for a compulsive gambler, but that doesn't make it okay.|`|rSTNUGy3aa	I'm really sorry that you're having to deal with your mother's apparent gambling addiction.  Please talk with someone that you trust such as your aunt, school guidance counselor, teacher, school nurse or such especially since your mom leaves you in the care of your siblings.  Addiction typically affects the whole family and not just the addict as you seem to be finding out.  <br>  <br>  Someone mentioned that your mom (and you and your siblings) would really benefit from professional help and that is a wonderful idea.  Those with any type of dependency (gambling, drugs, alcohol, food, shopping/spending) may be very resistant to change and even be in denial that there is a problem.  <br>  <br>  There are free support groups (Not usually run by professionals though) for those with family or friends that have a gambling problem called Gam-anon though I'm not sure if there are any local groups.  A similar support group for relatives and friends of the alcoholic called Al-anon may have more groups nationwide and one may attend an "open" Al-anon group for anyone to participate.<br>  <br>  For Gam-anon:  <a href="http://www.gam-anon.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.gam-anon.org</a><br>  <br>  For Al-anon:  <a href="http://www.al-anon.alateen.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-anon.alateen.org</a><br>  <br>  For the addicts themselves (or to attend a possible "open" Gambler's Anonymous meeting:  <a href="http://www.gamblersanonymous.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamblersanonymous.org</a>|`|8yAQjqRpaa	that sounds really bad you should  ask the professionals.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gamblingtherapy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamblingtherapy.org/</a>|`|85AoQYh8aa	wow thats bad i wish i could help but i really think she needs some sort of intervention if it is that bad.<br>  <br>  What she needs to know is what this addiction will cause and someone needs to tell her that this type of compulsive gambling can and will cause her to lose you guys and her husband sometime in the future if it persists just a matter of time.<br>  <br>  I dont expect you to be able to do this alone and It will be tough without your dad around but what you need to do and it will sound tough but its for the best is get in touch with your aunt or someone close and tell them whats going on and eventually confront your mother and let her know what it is doing to you guys and you have to make it clear that if she continues down the same road she will not only lose money but more importantly the ones that love her and i presume that deep down she loves.

9syRhKe9aa	There is no other secret besides the super mode that will enhance your score with practice. The staff member does nothing. I never tried to master the super mode; my brain prefers to work linearly. I find it faster to wait for a fish/rainbow negg to pop up if I need a high score (that's the way I beat AAA, anyway :P). The only way to consistently get scores nearing 1000, though, is to use that mode. <br>  <br>  This seems to be a really good guide: <a href="http://petpages.neopets.com/~Striped_Tiger156" rel="nofollow">http://petpages.neopets.com/~Striped_Tig...</a>
Xm5ab6F6aa	The company will buy their graphics from an artist, or use a staff artist. The art has to be at a much higher resolution than web art, for most good presses 300 dpi at cmyk (Cyan, Magenta,yellow and Black) with a 5th or 6th on the press.<br>  <br>  Also then have to be very care full about owning the rights to the artwork, since they could be sued by the artist who produced the art. Most artist own the rights to their artwork. This would be a copyright infringement and they would have a huge lawsuit against them, that's why you see that small copyright symbol on the art.
NI8pKCEpaa	Theme parks are an amazing time for kids... they forget about being bored by the fact that they are scared shitless of the ride their on. when i was a kid family activities were always boring... kids usually dont want to do family activities its more about the parents, but sometimes the kids will learn to like it and have more fun than they expected.  Also its not a bad idea to bring along some of your kids freinds on family activities, that way your happy your with your kid, and he's happy he gets to see his friends. especially if your kids are into sports, go play basketball or football with the kids and their Friends. Something like football where u are the all time QB to keep it fair. You may think your kids don't want to play competitively, but i strongly disagree that almost every kid has an amazing competitive spirit that parents overlook because they see how small and fragile they are. Sports are great because the Competition makes it so they will never grow tired of it, if you take a kid to a duck pond every day hes gunna get sick of it, but a kid may never grow sick of basketball if  he has somone to play against. And by playing sports you will introduce him to other good ways to have fun on his own.<br>  Or you could go fishing if you like to fish.<br>  Or snowboarding or skiing if there is a mountain near by.<br>  Or something like laser tag depending on how old they are, or an arcade<br>  <br>  My main point is that it's hard for kids to have fun during family events (because they want to be with their Friends to have fun not their family), so unless the activity is something the kid genuinely likes, he will be upset. It doesn't seem to matter as much to the Mom, dad, and other older members of family events because they can enjoy just being with each other and talking and seeing their children.<br>  <br>  This is off topic and u might completely disregard everything i said for making this one point, but, if your kids are at an age of 16 or so (one where they increasingly stop spending time with you to hang out with their teenage friends), you may seriously want to consider smoking marijuana with them (especially if you have already caught them, or you know they already do it with their friends). The way i see it you have 2 options: You can be the parent who grows far away from his kid and is just there to yell at him when he comes home, and ground him on the weekend, ruining some of the best years of his and your life. OR you could say maybe the government got this one wrong... and start caring about your kid more than whats legal. You will find that events like this make you and your son feel more alike, and you will both GENUINELY enjoy spending time with each other...what more could you want with your kid.<br>  Sorry if you are against marijuana and you think this idea is stupid, but i am extremely passionate about this topic, and i just thought it might help.<br>  <br>  <br>  These are all just my personal opinions,im not trying to give parenting advice i just remember what being a kid was like.|`|mVZBiACSaa	How about :<br>  <br>  Uno Spin<br>  Twister<br>   or if there yougner you could play goldfish and snap and those fun card games..

wAiVxAKNaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Please note immediately that crafting Law Runes is a members-only feature.<br>  <br>  The Law Altar is on Entrana, a small island Northwest of Port Sarim. DO NOT TRY GETTING THERE ON FOOT! :P It won't work because you have to travel there by ship from Port Sarim.<br>  <br>  Okay, here is how you can get to Port Sarim from Lumbridge. From Lumbridge General Store, head West until you reach Draynor VIllage. You will know if it is Draynor Village because there will be several Willow trees behind the bank. Bank all your weapons, armor and familiars at this point.<br>  <br>  From Draynor Village, head Northwest from the Market and then turn South from the cabbage patch. You will see some docks. Go onto the docks, and when you see monks (They will probably be the first humans you will see) talk to them.<br>  <br>  The monks will inspect you for anything that is "not approved of by Saradomin". You can not take weapons, armor or familiars and scrolls on to Entrana. If you have these items, bank them and return to the Monks.<br>  <br>  When you're on Entrana, head North until you cross a bridge and you will see the Mysterious Ruins. Click on them and you will enter into the area where you can craft law runes. You will need LEVEL 54 Runecrafting to make law runes.|`|pzdLyDzLaa	Hey, the law rune altar is on an island called Entrana. To get there you have to be a member, just search up on the internet "law rune altar" and it'll tell you where it is, im pretty sure you a take a boat from Port Sarim there though.

Mathematically you win. So <br>    the options are part of the strategic increase in power.  Power over <br>    the opponents is fear.  The idea therefore is to guess where they <br>    are trying to damage your system.  You place lots of armies here<br>    and the simple fool will try to batter himself off your wall.  Another<br>    outcome is to spread out quickly.  If you have to move against the<br>    strongest team with quality dice.  This chance game is not something<br>    that has intellectual results so the game of chance it is is part of <br>    the second choice in play, go for the gold.  Play it with someone that<br>    has played before and perhaps after 2 games you will be solid.|`|gxdej2deaa	yes you do draft a certain number of troops at the beginning of each turn based on the number of countries you own and the number of continents that you have conquered|`|AOgK773Eaa	read the freakin directions...|`|IGXE3aDraa	theres a book of directions read those|`|h34uz6Rgaa	If you don't own any continents or didn't cash cards, you get 3 armies.<br>  You get the bonus of your continent if you own the entire continent at the start of your turn:<br>  South America 2<br>  North America 5<br>  Europe 5<br>  Asia 7<br>  and Australia 2<br>  If you exchange cards then you get the number of armies the cards are worth:<br>  3 artilleries are 4 armies<br>  3 infantry are 6 armies<br>  3 tanks are 8 armies<br>  and 1 of each are 10 armies<br>  hope that helps<br>  <br>  Oh, and for every three countries you own after 9 countries (12,15, etc.) you get an extra army.|`|ZnC6X87Laa	There are several versions of risk, and you can always change the rules if everyone agrees to it. But if I remember correctly, everyone gets 3 units every turn no matter what. Also there is a number next to all the continents which determine how many units you get if you control that entire continent. There is also a card pile which you take 1 card from each turn which has either 1 or 2 stars at the bottom. You can trade in cards for more units. One game I played it was like 10 stars for 30 units, or 5 stars for like 15 and so on...but you need to read the rules to fully understand the game.|`|gkxUYCq6aa	There is two ways to set up...<br>  The territories are either dealt out randomly, or the players take turns picking (placing a single army on each).  <br>  <br>  Then additional armies are placed (either all at once or one at a time).  The amount of armies received depends on the number of players...<br>  3 players: 35<br>  4 players: 30<br>  5 players: 25<br>  and so on...<br>  <br>  Then once you begin playing you get additional armies at the beginning of each turn using the following...<br>  take the total number of territories and divide by three (round down) with a minimum of three armies.<br>  you will get additional armies if you control an entire continent (those amounts can be found on your game board).<br>  You get more armies by trading in "Risk Cards."  <br>  The first set traded in - 4 armies<br>  The second set traded in - 6 armies<br>  The third set traded in - 8 armies<br>  The fourth set traded in - 10 armies<br>  The fifth set traded in - 12 armies<br>  The sixth set traded in - 15 armies<br>  <br>  Hope it helps...<br>  if you have more questions i've included the url to the rulebooks (all of them).|`|c9121491eeaf13f0417f764440eacfb5aa	You get reinforcements at the beginning of every turn depending on the amount of countries you have.|`|AA10271718	<a href="http://gamebits.gameroom.com/RULES/Risk_Rules.html" rel="nofollow">http://gamebits.gameroom.com/RULES/Risk_...</a><br>  Official list of rules.|`|DFTB95BQaa	<a href="http://gamebits.gameroom.com/RULES/Risk_Rules.html" rel="nofollow">http://gamebits.gameroom.com/RULES/Risk_...</a>

I am 53, and have a horrible confession:<br>  Although I currently have no NERF toys, until not long ago I did.  I gave them to a friend or relative's kid.  I can't recall who I gave them too.   <br>  <br>  NERF toys are great to relive tension, are harmless, and are used by some executive trainers for "role playing / learning games".<br>  <br>  If you like NERF toys, good for you!<br>  I;d rather you throw a nerf football than rocks.

154dzJ1Faa	The simplest mordant we use with wool is alum.  If you are using any of the metals (chrome, tin, copper) those are extremely poisonous, so you want to avoid those.<br>  <br>  You can also use some modifiers such as vinegar, rhubarb leaves, iron, to get various intensities and variations of colours.<br>  <br>  You can use any kind of plant material for your source of colour.  Not all plants give the colour you think!  Beets, a deep red colour that stains everything, only gives you a kind of tan dye. Blueberries come out slightly brown too.  Most green plants will give a yellow or greenish tone.  But it's fun to try and see what shades you can get!

I350V2jsaa	Remote lines usually come with some trouble, when people at the paintball park i go to have problems with remote lines, it comes as no surprise, but along the chopping, most of the problem is probably because a cyclone feed uses air to run it, and due to that the length of the line creates a very small time delay in between when the trigger is pulled, when the air goes through the line, and when the feed turns, not to mention shoot the ball.  but all i can recommend is get a shorter line, try a different kind, or just don't use one.|`|aa9gieAIaa	im almost 100% sure most of your problems are unrelated to useing a long coiled remote line. it sounds to me like if your playing in decent temperatures (above 50 degrees Fahrenheit) you might have a clog/leak from the valve body to the feed system and/or response trigger. or if its just dirty/needs oil that can cause both symptoms. the cyclone should never chop balls when its working regardless of tank pressure. it should load it or not load it at all provided its like the a5 one. you may have clogged it up because of garbage that was in that remote system when you bought it as thats probably no coincidence. id take it apart and clean/inspect it all if your able to. ive used remote systems in cold/warm weather with the a5 and would say it improves performance   due to the increase in surface area to absorb heat. if you have a leak or hold the tank upside down that is bad of course and can cause "freezing". id guess garbage in the air system is all that did it though. good luck

3rgJpqjZaa	The Conduit is a futuristic first-person shooter game under development by High Voltage Software for the Wii console. <br>  <br>  The storyline focuses on an alien invasion of Washington, D.C. in the near future.

An organization called the Trust sends Mr. Ford, a newly inducted agent, into the area to discover the reasons for the attack.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conduit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conduit</a>|`|z2LGqY0Gaa	Well there are certainly a lot of different games for the wii.  That's how I pick my games too.  Yeah, Chop Till You Drop wasn't as good on the wii, but that's cause there aren't as many hordes of zombies, which can make for a boring zombie game if you are a fan.  Also it had some lame mini games added, but it did get the photography taken away if you didn't like that!  Boom Blox is a different one that I got, like the game jenga, but digital.  If you like rail shooters the new House of the Dead Overkill got good reviews, but it might be pushing your 50 in store cred cause it's brand new.  No More Heroes is a very different and interesting title for the wii.  Wario Ware smooth moves would be great if they have it but it's not all too common and can be as much as a new release.  Either of the Resident evils are great choices and relatively cheap.  Umbrella Chronicles has res evil 0 and 3 nemesis presented as a rail shooter.  Res evil 4 is a wii vamped version of the old great game.  You could get a wii points card from gamestop and buy anything on the wii network, World of Good being the most interesting title right now.  Okami is a cool release that has you as a wolf character and consists of drawing attack patterns and traveling through beautifully drawn lands.  Mad World does look awesome but this is a title that I think I'm going to wait on, I watched the gameplay video on xplay and it looked boring, they just kept picking up enemies and taking them to the side to kill them one at a time.  I'm hoping there is more content to it they couldn't show than this cause the video was dull.  It could end up going for a lot cheaper on ebay the week it comes out like prince of persia did for 360 and ps3.  Trauma center is a cool game, but if you have one it plays better on a ds.  Hope this gave you a few ideas!  Links to gameplay footage posted below.|`|CENBZINeaa	The last Wii got I got was "Boom Blox."  It's pretty cool, kinda a puzzle game, I suppose.  It's especially fun w/ some pal playing w/ you.  My friend got "Blazing Angels" and it's pretty cool.  But, you may not like flying games.  For me, good Wii games seem few n' far between.  I love Mario, Zelda, Metroid, n' Mario Kart, but there are some killer games, which one can only play on 360 or PS3.  Street Fighter 4 on 360 kicks butt!  "Wario Ware: Smooth Moves" is pretty fun.....very odd n' wacky n' bizarre.  Good luck n' keep on gaming.|`|rEzc8ooLaa	i wouldnt get deadrising. i hear it is WAY too easy cause the zombies barely attack you. I would get Resident Evil 4 or Animal Crossing Wild World.

I mean, the Water Temple in Ocarina of Time is widely regarded as one of the most difficult, complicated dungeons ever (seriously, it's a nightmare), and fighting the final form of Puppet Ganon in Wind Waker is pretty difficult; he moved to quickly for me to hit his tail with the light arrows.  Personally though, I think The Legend of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link was the most difficult; I had a lot of trouble fighting the constant stream of enemies that came from both sides once I was engaged in battle or exploring a dungeon.  And it generally seems like the 3D Zelda games are more difficult than their 2D cousins; especially the archery minigames.|`|7lYxPRiQaa	Twight princess on gamecube|`|vOFjegFvaa	Ocarina of time!!!!!!<br>  Well thats my personal favorite|`|djBYzX4Qaa	i dont know.. very wide range..

Well, My answers is that Lots of Spellcasters have high attack power and have awesome effects...Why waste getting weak spellcasters that summon more spellcasters if you can have powerful ones with awesome effects...|`|93z96Ue9aa	my favorite is apprentice magician. it pulls out a lvl 2 or lower spellcaster (like old vindictive magician) n even lets you put a spell counter on a card. try this|`|g863rNLJaa	yes. skilled dark magician. when your opponent or you uses a spell card. put 1 spell counter on it. once you have 3 spell counters u can tribute that card and the counters to special summon dark magician. also their are those lv magicians but i forgot the name of the card
