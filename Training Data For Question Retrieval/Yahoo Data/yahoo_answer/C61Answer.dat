Those notifications went out to deaf ears who did not react . As Bush sat in a classroom preparing for his presidency to begin that morning a look was on his face of Its really going down just as it was planned and I need to get myself together and pull this off . <br>  Act as If I am shocked that this happened when I had made it possible in the first place by ordering the close surveillance lifted on this group of Foreigners the Fbi had been in close contact with for months . <br>  Now no one need believe the truth if their mind can wrap around the truth of this tragic event and those responsible but the confession will go down in history and the truth will become just anther conspiracy theory that no one could possibly believe . That this government assisted in an attack on our own soil for the purpose of creating an on going need to manufacture weapons and to begin closer survalliance of its own people . <br>  Soon we will be like England with police cameras on every corner .

0422dba13a1c20003a0e7488873e0b13aa	The final solution is to put enough soldiers on the ground, in the streets so that we can deter violence long enough to win hearts and minds in the communities. By the time we lighten up the presence and the militias/insurgents/terrorists come back to the surface, the people will no longer want them there and prefer to live in peace. That's the solution. We have only been doing that on a small scale. Now is our chance, with this surge, to make it happen all over Baghdad. It does work. I've been able to do it in my area of Baghdad with great success. <br>  <br>  When it's all said and done, we can complete the peace enforcing part of this war and be a complete success.|`|AA12163514	That is why the libs are unqualified- 4 years of war- and you still don't get it.|`|CnuvceURaa	Winning in Iraq, give me a break nobody can win this kinda war with terrorists I am sorry to say.

Si tu y vis vraiment tu verrais que la majorité des gens (jeunes et moins jeunes) se lève le matin pour aller bosser s'ils ne l'ont pas fait pendant la nuit...

Le 1er but des 4 candidats majeurs (ceux qui ont plus de 15% d'intention de vote) est de se qualifier pour le second tour, et pour cela à la fois de se démarquer suffisament des autres sur un électorat quantitativement susceptible de lui faire passer ce cap.  Pour Sarko, son électorat est entre le centre et l'extrème droite.  Il lui faut grapiller de chaque coté pour passer et il ne peut grapiller des voix que là où ses adversaires sont les plus faibles.<br>  Logiquement, le plus faible de ses 2 limites (Bayrou et Le Pen) est Le Pen, mais la limite est ténue.   Ceci dit il a la chance que la droite fasse 60 % des votes fran?ais.<br>  Pour Sego, c'est plus compliqué.  Tant qu'il n'y avait pas Bayrou, elle pouvait ratisser du centre à l'extrême gauche.

RggSdnvcaa	Cuando tenia 17 a?os fui a estudiar a Londres por 9 meses, y al final me quede por 2 a?os, esto debido a que mi novia me dejaba vivir con ella y hasta ahy todo estaba bien, el problema es que no podia conseguir un trabajo porque solo tenia 19 a?os y nada mas era bachiller, cosa que no valia en londres, estuve un tiempo trabajando en el negocio de unos colombianos, pero una vez llegaron los de inmigracion y se armo todo un rollo con el jefe por meter a trabajar a ilegales, asi que no le quedo de otra que despedirme, en mi pais era un ni?o mimado que no sabia planchar, cocinar, lavar ni siquiera sabia como manejar un taladro, asi que el hecho de valerme por mi mismo fue una leccion que aprendi a golpes (metaforicamente hablando) mis padres me mandaban 600 euros todos los meses pero eso no me alcanzaba para vivir, especialmente en londres que es una ciudad excesivamente costosa, me mantenia paseando perros y haciendo uno que otro trabajo, pero un dia la relacion con mi novia se volvio insoportable y terminamos, yo decidi que lo mejor era regresarme a mi pais.<br>  <br>  Aun asi, por mas que extra?ara a mi familia, no queria regresar al tercer mundismo, asi que me fui a vivir a Barcelona, Espa?a, donde tenia a unos tios, ellos tenian una franquicia de Subway y empeze a trabajar en ella, pero nunca me pude adaptar a tanta xenofobia, no podia entender como en una ciudad donde habia tantos compatriotas latinos hubiera tanto odio contra ellos, yo no la pazaba tan mal por ser blanco, pero tenia 2 amigos peruanos con facciones indigenas muy marcadas, y salir con ellos era casi traumatico, no los dejaban entrar a ciertos lugares y en los restauranes los mesoneros no nos atendian y cuando caminabamos por la calle la gente se los quedaba mirando fijamente, como si fueran bichos de circo, y apenas yo le decia a la gente que era de Venezuela, lo primero que mencionaban era a Chavez, nos tardabamos horas hablando de esto, porque pareciera que no conocieran mas nada de Venezuela que Chavez, cansado de esto, aveces decia que era colombiano, debido a que mi mama es colombiana puedo imitar muy bien el acento, y en estos casos me iba peor, la gente me miraba de reojo, como si estuvieran esperando que sacara una bolsa de droga o una pistola y que derrepente empezara a cantar vallenatos.<br>  <br>  Despues de 4 meses, decidi que tenia mas metas en la vida que ser un cajero en un restaurante de comida rapida hasta mi muerte, asi que tome la desicion de regresarme a Venezuela a estudiar Estudios Internacionales, y eso es lo que estoy estudiando ahorita, me va muy bien, manejo casi perfectamente el ingles y aprendi mucho de frances y algo de hindu en Londres, tambien catalan. Espero poder trabajar algun dia en el exterior (me gustaria que fuera Paris, pero no soy exigente) ) para luchar por el bien de mi pais.|`|VgJi5vulaa	A ninguno de ellos.

But for the conservative party to get back on track they need to embrace their base once again.  Fallwell was a polarizing figure at times but he was also a target in the left's war on christianity.  More and more everyday, it is Christianity that is blamed for the world's problems in lieu of the genuine culprits.<br>  <br>  The christian base is the power of the conservative party and they all know that.<br>  <br>  Jerry Fallwell was a good man.  He did everything that he could do for those ailing in this world.  He did preach, but he lived what he preached.  He was not a hypocrite.  I am in no way a very religious man, but I appreciate those who do not live a hypocritical lifestyle.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that they should not be ashamed, they should praise the man's life.|`|39e478f7414d720b5bfa453f2467ceddaa	No, not unless they endorse those particular opinions at the same time that they praise Falwell.

Por ello, hoy más que nunca nos manifestamos contra el poder sin control, no democrático e impune de los grandes medios de comunicación que intentan imponer su visión de la realidad y sus valores. Estos oligopolios sirven a intereses económicos y políticos de accionistas, financieros y anunciantes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sin embargo, las transnacionales mediáticas están perdiendo credibilidad y se ha echado por tierra el mito de la invulnerabilidad de los medios. En América Latina, hay dos polos equidistantes: por un lado, el refuerzo de la soberanía, y por otro, la renuncia al espacio público. Por ejemplo, mientras México está renunciando a ese ámbito para entregarlo a perpetuidad a dos consorcios mediáticos, en Venezuela se está recobrando una concesión que imponía la dictadura de la palabra y la imagen únicas (RCTV). Como dijo el Presidente Hugo Chávez, ahora no estamos luchando contra la libertad de prensa, estamos restableciendo esa libertad.<br>  <br>  <br>  La red de redes En Defensa de la Humanidad se pronuncia por asegurar el derecho a la información y la comunicación como un derecho humano fundamental. Para ello, es de primer orden demostrar la ilegitimidad del sistema actual donde los medios están al servicio de los poderosos. Hay que recordar que se ha producido una enorme concentración antidemocrática y es abrumador el control del capital financiero sobre los grandes medios. <br>  <br>  <br>  Debemos identificar quiénes son los aliados de los pueblos en los medios y quiénes son sus enemigos. Denunciamos a los mercenarios intelectuales que alquilan su pensamiento a las grandes transnacionales. Denunciamos a instituciones y grupos de comunicación que en nombre de un distorsionado concepto de la libertad de expresión sirven a estructuras económicas e imperialistas, como Reporteros Sin Fronteras y la Sociedad Interamericana de Prensa. Asimismo, condenamos el asesinato, la persecución y la exclusión en los medios de comunicación, de periodistas que han hecho y hacen de su ejercicio una tradición de lucha por los mejores intereses de sus pueblos.<br>  <br>  <br>  Para enfrentar al sistema dominante, contamos con los medios alternativos y la posibilidad real de fortalecer la voz de los pueblos en los medios tradicionales. Lo alternativo no está re?ido con la excelencia. Es vital no enajenarnos de la veracidad, el rigor y la profesionalidad, y evitar reproducir formatos alienantes, conceptos y prácticas clasistas, sexistas y racistas de las transnacionales de la información. <br>  <br>  <br>  El modelo de comunicación que defendemos no es el del “socialismo real”, controlado por una élite política que renunciaba a la pluralidad y a la comunicación verdadera con sus pueblos. Reconocemos que la neutralidad y la imparcialidad no existen: toda información tiene una intencionalidad oculta o manifiesta.<br>  <br>  <br>  Los estados tienen el deber de garantizar el derecho a la información y la democratización de los medios y el acceso a todos los sectores sociales. Esa garantía se logra mediante el uso público del espacio radioeléctrico y la propiedad social de los medios.<br>  <br>  <br>  La palabra socialismo tiene múltiples interpretaciones, y por eso genera resistencia en parte de la opinión pública. Legitimarla supone rescatar sus tradiciones en la lucha por la justicia social, la paz y la felicidad de los pueblos. Debemos insistir más en el contenido que en el vocablo. De manera estratégica hay que combatir y seguir deslegitimando al capitalismo, e identificar desde los problemas del medioambiente hasta la destrucción social. <br>  <br>  <br>  La red de redes En Defensa de la Humanidad destaca los valores centrales del socialismo de nuestros días: el uso sustentable de los recursos naturales y el control público de los que no son renovables; la satisfacción de las necesidades de la gente por encima de los criterios de mercado; la defensa de la democracia en todas las relaciones colectivas y de género, y también, la interculturalidad, la posibilidad de acceso a todos los saberes, filosofías y religiones.<br>  <br>  <br>  Reconocemos el papel trascendente de los pueblos originarios en los procesos revolucionarios de nuestro tiempo y su aporte a la práctica de una democracia participativa que concibe el gobierno como servicio, que manda obedeciendo en la solidaridad y el sentido colectivo de sus instituciones. Valoramos que se deben defender y promover los medios propios de las comunidades.<br>  <br>  <br>  Nos solidarizamos con las resistencias contra la ocupación en Iraq y contra las intervenciones en el Medio Oriente que, debilitando al imperio, permiten que los procesos revolucionarios sigan avanzando en América Latina.<br>  <br>  <br>  Condenamos el doble rasero del gobierno de Washington, la Unión Europa y los emporios mediáticos, que promueven la doctrina del buen y el mal terrorista, como se verifica en los casos de Luis Posada Carriles y los Cinco cubanos presos en Estados Unidos.<br>  <br>  <br>  Apoyamos los procesos revolucionarios en América Latina y la presencia de la voz legítima de los pueblos en las asambleas constituyentes. En particular, apoyamos los procesos de cambio que están teniendo lugar en Bolivia, que han permitido que los pueblos acrecienten su protagonismo. Reivindicamos el trascendente papel de los pueblos originarios, de las mujeres y de la juventud en las luchas de hoy.<br>  <br>  <br>  La Red de Redes en Defensa de la Humanidad debe ampliarse y fortalecerse; debe promover estructuras de traducción para que las lenguas no sean barreras entre los pueblos; estimular procesos legales en contra de los medios de comunicación que violan el derecho legítimo a la información. ?Nuestra lucha es por la verdad y por la justicia!<br>  <br>  <br>  Cochabamba, Bolivia, 23 de mayo de 2007|`|oUmo9oUyaa	pobrecitos los que no van a ver el programa del gay que lee el tarot?????? o la novelita de bajo presupuesto???? me da lastima?????

rAcQW9afaa	Like most things, it depends.  Any lawyer would probably want to know at least the following:<br>  a) when did you have the surgery?  <br>  b) when did the doctor admit this?<br>  c) did he admit it in writing?  if not,were there any witnesses present when he admitted it?<br>  d) will another (reputable) doctor or doctors be able to testify that the current condition of your foot is the fault of the doctor who performed the surgery?<br>  e) did you do anything to contribute to the current state of your foot (for example, did you fail to rehabilitate it through exercise, etc.)?|`|02d254c8ad07aa851c90779a6749d806aa	You can always file suit..... but it don't mean you will win.<br>  <br>  The issues are is did the Doctor commit an act upon you that is something that could be malpractice.  Is the surgery something that has left you disfigured in a way that had malice?<br>  <br>  If you could prove that you were disfigured in a way that would make the common man see you as handicapped because of the procedure and not your affliction than you might have a case.<br>  <br>  There are some things that are not worth fighting in court. If you have reached maximum recovery and the doctors did all that they could, then you have no case.|`|C5IDIAZoaa	The statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims in Texas is 2 years.

Different states have different SOL's, which are, in essence, legal deadlines, after which you do not have recourse.<br>  The second question pertains to the first. Depending on your state you must provide the date of alleged negligence to an attorney to see if you have a valid and viable case.<br>  Speak to an attorney who specialized in medical malpractice and only charges you a percentage (no more than 35-40%) of the recovered damages. This way you don't pay anyone anything unless you collect.<br>  Call and see. It doesn't hurt to check it out, but if it's been a while, don't get your hopes up too high.

It is not the intent of the law to allow someone to gain a windfall through civil action, but rather to be made whole in light of their lose and or damages.  He is trying to justify some ridiculous damages.  I think this case should be on the poster for torte reform.

He thinks (as do some others) that he's simply a test case for the Consumer Protection Act in the District--showing its poorly drafted nature.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the amount he's asking for is patently ridiculous.  According to him, they ruined an $1100 suit by losing the pants. They offered him $150 (minus money for age of the suit) to replace the pants--although they were part of a suit and could not be individually replaced. The $1100 is justified, as is some monies for his attorneys fees (he is acting as his own attorney, but DC has very set law allowing an attorney representing themselves to collect reasonable attorneys fees).  But fees for renting a car to drive to another cleaners?  Not going to another dry cleaners because your satisfaction is guaranteed?  Come on, people!<br>  <br>  I actually predict that he will win something.  Nothing close to the $54 million that he's currently asking for, but something nonetheless.

Se tu li prendessi a uno per uno anzichè in branco come i conigli, probabilmente non saprebbero dirti cos'ha fatto di buono Mussolini, che pure di cose buone ne ha fatte in vent'anni.

Mussolini è stato il più grande uomo politico che abbiamo avuto, non per il fascismo e l'alleanza con Hitler ma perchè ha prodotto le migliori legge che ancora oggi ci governano, fornendo ai lavoratori paghe, contratti e posti migliori di lavoro. Ha sbagliato a fidarsi di Hitler per carità non lo neghiamo  ma di cose grandi ne ha fatte tante. Documentati e capirai che questo centra poco con chi e deficiente che sia a dx o a sx.

8MrCPnKLaa	La réponse est non... Même si ton algérienne n'est pas musulmane (car il faut le rappeler ce n'est pas parce qu'on est algérien qu'on est forcément musulman) tu seras obligé de te convertir à l'islam car il n'y a pas en algérie de séparation entre la religion et l'état comme en France. L'algérie n'est pas un pays la?c. Donc si tu comptes vivre là-bas, fais-le, et personne viendra regarder chez toi si tu es pratiquant ou pas.

MOST NEWSPAPERS & TELEVISION NEWS HAS A LEFT WING SLANT.|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Yes.Most media outlets are owned by a handful of conservative corporations and individuals, and funded by usually economically conservative advertisers who have no need for an educated, alert, independent and critical citizenry. What they need is a dumb, bored, cynical and apathetic public that has abandoned all critical faculties and is easily distracted by celebrity gossip and mindless sports games. A public that will believe anything it is told, or nothing at all, which amounts to the same end result. This pro-corporate conservative bias of the media is well-documented and shows itself in consistent under-reporting or ignoring of any information that would lead people to question the fundamental status quo. <br>  Even Republican Pat Buchanan confessed, "For heaven sakes, we kid about the liberal media, but every Republican on earth does that." Neo-conservative pundit Bill Kristol also said, "I admit it: the liberal media were never that powerful, and the whole thing was often used as an excuse by conservatives for conservative failures."|`|e123ba186cea4e32b1880639ba3d784daa	Let's see here..<br>  <br>  FOX- Leans to the right, but allows both sides to express their views, the only news outlet that does so..<br>  <br>  CNN- Left<br>  ABC-Left<br>  NBC-Left<br>  MSNBC-Left<br>  CNBC-Left<br>  CBS-Left<br>  <br>  Need I go on?|`|w9hQnaTOaa	Only on Fox is their a right leaning media.

I go to the malls , car lots , and see hundreds of homes empty in my community .<br>  The mall shelves are loaded and so are the car lots and we seem to have enough food that locks have to be placed on the dumpsters behind grocery stores to prevent people from getting the food out . <br>  <br>  Its not a liberal thing to notice injustice . <br>  Its not liberal to notice that we can change for the better . <br>  <br>  It is only pig headed conservatives who hate change and have sex on thursday evening at 8;30 pm each week and go to Churches to worship a murderous God .|`|AA12349768	Obviously talk radio is biased to the right wing.

Elle est la deuxième puissance économique en Afrique avec un PIB annuel de 120 milliards USD en 2006, après l’Afrique du Sud avec 255.0 milliards USD. Sa monnaie est le dinar algérien (DA) abréviation courante ou (DZD) abréviation bancaire.<br>  <br>   L’Algérie est un important producteur et exportateur de gaz naturel (5e producteur et 4e exportateur[30]) et de pétrole (13e producteur et 9e exportateur[31]), et dispose aussi de réserves importantes de fer au Sud-Ouest, ainsi que d’or, d’uranium et de zinc à l’extrême Sud. Le pétrole et le gaz naturel, exploités par la société nationale Sonatrach, sont les principales sources de revenus. L’Algérie a su diversifier son économie en réformant son système agraire et en modernisant son industrie lourde, mais les hydrocarbures constituent encore la quasi-totalité des exportations. En outre, même si parmi les productions agricoles de l'Algérie, le pays est dans le monde le 1er producteur de fève verte, 5e de figue, 6e de datte, 9e d'abricot ou encore 10e d'amande[32], il est le 5e pays qui exporte le moins sa production agricole[33]. La dette extérieure de l’Algérie s’élevait en décembre 2006 à 4,7 milliards USD contre 17,5 milliards USD en 2005 – le pays est en train de rembourser par anticipation de vastes parts de ses dettes, utilisant ainsi l’afflux de devises inattendues liées à la hausse du prix du pétrole (voir : Pic pétrolier).<br>  <br>  En 2006, l’Algérie a achevé le remboursement anticipé de la totalité de sa dette rééchelonnée. En effet, des accords ont été signés sur le remboursement par anticipation de dettes notamment avec la Pologne, l’Arabie saoudite, la Turquie, l’Inde, la Slovénie et le Portugal, selon la presse locale. Avec ses créanciers publics du Club de Paris, l’Algérie a clos à la mi-novembre tout le processus de remboursement anticipé pour un montant global de 7,75 milliards de dollars. Elle avait également remboursé par anticipation sa dette rééchelonnée avec le Club de Londres en septembre dernier pour un montant de 800 millions de dollars.<br>  <br>  Grace à la hausse des prix de pétrole sur le marché international, la trésorerie de l’Algérie, membre de l’Organisation des pays exportateurs de pétrole (OPEP), est relativement solide, ce qui lui permet non seulement de rembourser par anticipation ses dettes extérieures, mais aussi de lancer plusieurs importants projets d’infrastructures.<br>  <br>  D’après la Banque mondiale[34], le classement de 2006 par produit intérieur brut (PIB) des principales puissances économiques du continent africain positionne l'Algérie à la deuxième place. Ci-dessous le classement établi :<br>  <br>  <br>  Avec la libéralisation progressive de son économie[36], l’Algérie commence à séduire de plus en plus d’investisseurs étrangers, notamment après la promulgation de la loi n° 02-01 du 5 février 2002 qui pose les principes de base de la libéralisation des marchés de l’électricité et de la distribution du gaz par canalisations et la création de la Commission de régulation de l’électricité et du gaz (CREG). L’Algérie vient en tête de la région MEDA en termes de ? flux d’investissements ?, souligne une étude sur l’investissement direct étranger en 2004 dans la région MEDA, du réseau euro-méditerranéen des agences de promotion des investissements (Anima)[37]. Le document précise que la reprise ? très nette ? observée en 2004 est largement due au secteur de l’énergie. Les IDE commencent cependant à s’élargir à d’autres domaines que les hydrocarbures tels que les télécommunications, le tourisme, l’industrie, etc. Autant de projets qui font qu’aujourd’hui, note le document d’Anima, l’Algérie devient une destination pour les IDE, malgré un climat d’investissement qui reste à améliorer. Le montant des investissements annoncé par le Mediterranean Investiment Project Observatory (MIPO) pour l’Algérie est de 5,857 milliards d’euros pour 59 projets contre 2,519 milliards d’euros en 2003 pour 31 projets.<br>  <br>  La croissance économique a été obtenue en premier lieu par le secteur du batiment et des travaux publics (+7,1 %), suivi de celui des hydrocarbures (+5,8 %) et des services (+5,6 %), alors que l’agriculture n’a progresse que de 1,9 %.<br>  <br>  Principaux indicateurs économiques Indicateur valeur <br>  PIB 120 milliards USD (2006)[38] <br>  PIB/habitant 3 487 USD (2006)[39] <br>  Croissance 5,1 % (2005) <br>  Inflation 2,5 % (2006)[39] <br>  Ch?mage 12,3 % (2006)[40] <br>  Réserves en devise 90,96 milliards USD (juin 2007)[41] <br>  Dette extérieure 4,6 milliards USD (juin 2007)[42] <br>  Solde budgétaire +3,9 % du PIB (2003) <br>  Exportations 54,6 milliards USD (2006) <br>  Importations 21,4 milliards USD (2006) <br>  Production pétrolière 1,450 million de barils par jour (2004) <br>  Réserves pétrolières 43 milliards bep (2006) <br>  Réserves de gaz 4 500 milliards de mètres cubes <br>  Investissements directs étrangers : 1,7 milliard USD (2006) <br>  Source : CIA World Factbook[43] et Présidence de la République Algérienne[44].|`|c3f4e2dc857840ac96afcf1c89d9cbb9aa	ok et ensuite ?|`|dMWgEQWFaa	un peuple solide...des feignasses oui!!!  un des pays les plus corrompus au monde.|`|xN0oF3l0aa	Les Algériens sont respectables, ils ont un très beau pays et une richesse naturelle et humaine importante, avec le prix du pétrole actuelle, l'Algérie peut améliorer ses agrégats économiques et sociaux, regarder l'avenir et mettez entre parenthèse le passé.

Her parents, Black Loyalists, came to Nova Scotia when Rose was ten, where they were given their freedom. To earn money, Rose began working as a baggage carrier, transporting luggage and other items from the docks in a wheelbarrow. She expanded her business to cover all of the town and also operated a ‘wake-up’ service, alerting travellers so they wouldn't miss their boat.<br>  <br>  Also at this time, Rose Fortune appointed herself as the police department of Annapolis Royal. She imposed and enforced curfews and kept the wharves under control. She was the first known policewoman in Canada.<br>  <br>  Rose Fortune is buried in an unmarked grave in the Royal Garrison cemetery.

They could have charged him with posession. In order to get the charge thrown out he would need to hire a lawyer to file a motion to suppress the evidence. The evidence would be excluded as it was obtained without a proper warrant. <br>  He would still have to pay his lawyer who would likely charge more than two thousand.<br>  <br>  You might beat the charge but they can still make you take the ride!|`|9XJLlPaEaa	If it's illegal, it' illegal whether or not the cop has found it. <br>  <br>  Any evidence would be the fruit of the poisonous tree. <br>  <br>  He should be able to get his money back but nothing else.

Just doesn't sound right.  And that's if the rest of the story is really true.|`|s8cZsSX0aa	Well they can't get him on it but can confiscate what they found, it is still an illegal substance. The warrant even though in the previous owners name is valid enough to enter the home. After they have entrance anything in plain sight is fair game. The money should serve always as a reminder that when something is illegal it is against the law to have it. The money will be tagged as evidence to an ongoing investigation, which local authorities will now be investigating your friend. So the money is gone. Tell your friend to stay clean and don't do anything wrong and he hasn't got anything to worry about, and take the loss of money as a lesson.

I would not put anything past this wolf in sheep's clothing.|`|znAV0dRDaa	This is so irresponsible.  Osama bin Laden is responsible for the deaths of many people, most of which were Americans.  He is responsible for the worse terrorist attack on American soil.  Obama is loyal American citizen. He is a church going man.  A Christian church.   A husband and father of 2 little girls.  He has served his country in the US Senate and is now wanting to lead this country because he believes that we need change.  What in any of the things we know about his life would make you think that he is a terrorist?  Because his name rhymes with a terrorist name?  That is so ignorant.  Even if you don't believe in his political views, which I'm guessing you don't even know, this accusation is horrible.  A pastor at his church said things that you don't like.

j1iRQp6faa	Just because he is 15 he can't get convicted for having a knife at school?  Please, yes he can.  Especially if it was found on his person.  He might not have used it, but there was intent.  Why did he feel the need to take the knife to school, and why didn't he tell someone about the problem?  Did you know about the problem?  If you did why didn't you as a parent do something about it.  You must teach your child that there are other solutions other than violence.  And taking a weapon to school is a serious matter, what if he used it and accidentally hurt another student who wasn't involved.  What then?<br>  <br>  I know that he is your son but this is a lesson well learned.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	 Yes he can.|`|u23sBafTaa	 Yes he can be convicted, it is a concealed weapon.

If it's his first problem they may go easy on him with house arrest and a bracelet to make sure he is there.|`|Gezfmghuaa	You didn't say where you were so its kind of hard to give specifics.  However, he is definately in trouble for carrying a concealed weapons plus carrying it in school is usually a second violation.  He's looking at probation, suspension and maybe expulsion most likely.<br>  |`|p0c4mek6aa	Yes he can. And so he bloody should be, for reasons you mentioned in the first paragraph of your question details.|`|MI2U5sWyaa	definelty yes|`|TGPTu1Suaa	You need to provide more information to get a useful answer.  Regardless, you should try to get your son a lawyer.  <br>  <br>  1.  Was he 15 or 16 at the time of the alleged offense?<br>  2.  What state was he in?<br>  3.  What kind of knife was it / how long is the blade?  (Switchblade?  Swiss Army?  Kitchen knife?  Gravity knife?  The laws may differ).<br>  4.  How was the knife found?  Did he pull it out?  Did a teacher simply decide to search his bag?  Did he set off a metal detector at the entrance?<br>  5.  Is he alleged to have used the knife in any way?<br>  6. You said you and your son attended the police station for an interview.  Going to the interview was probably a mistake.  Remember, your son -- and indeed all of us -- have the right to remain silent.  Criminal suspects should exercise that right (or at least consult with a good lawyer before making the unusual decision to talk to the cops).  What exactly did your son say?  Did he say, "yeah I had the knife.  Yes I gave permission to the teacher to search my bag.  I was going to stab Johnny if he threatened me again"?<br>  <br>  Answers / responses to the above will get you better answers.<br>  <br>  FOLLOW-UP:  To respond to your additional info, you still don't tell us your jurisdiction so it makes responding very difficult.  You did describe yourself as "mum" so you may be a Brit or Canadian.  Either way, you say he got the knife from the school kitchen, which means he stole the knife.  Right there, he committed a crime, whether or not possession of a three inch blade in your jurisdiction is legal.  Get your son a lawyer.  If you don't think you can afford one, there are possible sources of free lawyers in the U.S., Canada and the UK.  Ask the court clerk; ask the local bar association. Tell us where you are.  He needs a lawyer.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	In general, whether having a knife is illegal will depend on local and state laws and will often depend on the length of the knife and whether it was concealed. However, having a weapon on school property is likely a more serious charge - but again it will depend on local and/or state laws. <br>  <br>  Assuming your son has a clean record and is not accused of actually brandishing the weapon or threatening someone with the weapon, it's very likely he won't get anything more serious than probation and/or community service. |`|6Gx7Bnniaa	i'm pretty sure you can be convicted of a crime, regardless of age. how heavy of a sentence he might receive, i have no idea. assuming since he wasn't threatening anyone with it, he might not get as bad of a sentence. it all really depends.|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	he can be prosecuted for this. However, if your legal representation is told the full story, they can make it known to the magistrates or judge that he was only carrying it for protection. If they believe him, he may get a reduced sentence.|`|M7GnRpd0aa	Yes he can. They are coming down very hard on anybody caught carrying a knife. He could even be sent to a youth detention center. I hope he has learnt his lesson. It's always the parents who have to pick up the pieces.|`|OQsj0Am3aa	Yes he can, and he can be sent to a juvenile detention centre as well.<br>  <br>  And at the moment they seem to be taking a really tough stance on Knife related crimes, so I'd be prepared for it not to go well.|`|aR8GDOqVaa	afraid so...after all the knife crime happening lately the government finally pulled their thumbs out their arses and did something about it|`|03v1j2lYaa	Of course he can. He had the knife with intention to use it. Thank goodness it didn't come to that else he could now be on a murder charge!|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	It's against the law to carry a knife in England.<br>  It would seem he's broken the law and, despite his reasons for carrying it, will have to suffer whatever consequences the courts decide.<br>  Although I can understand why young people carry knives for "self-defence", it does seem fairly obvious that that is an excuse that can be used by anybody. If they all use that excuse, and they do, and it's accepted as valid by the courts, nobody will ever be convicted.<br>  We have, as you and your son must know, enormous problems with knife crime in England. It has to be stopped, and the law is the only reasonable way to go about it.<br>  Although it may seem harsh to you that your son is looking at a fairly unsympathetic court, and probable conviction, I'm afraid you are both going to have to face the fact that he behaved criminally, and must face up to it.<br>  I don't believe his age should come into it - at 15 he is quite old enough to know right from wrong.|`|bspRfskYaa	Anybody above the age of 12 can be held criminally responsible so yes you can be convicted and I think the current rule is one month for every inch above 3 inches in jail/young offenders institute,  if it was less than three inches long he may be lucky.  Also, they are unlikely to be severe if it is his first offence.  Hopefully he will only get community service though and that will teach him a lesson.<br>  Good luck |`|MYfqL2Coaa	it depends on your Definition of convicted. i think that while they could be sencteced, if they are under 18 it would only be juvenille (i cant spell that word) and wouldnt be proper adult prison. but if its a first offence and the knife wasnt used, it would probably be a caution and some therapy thing or counselling or something|`|fUmo11IUaa	I'm guessing you're aware of all the teenagers that have been stabbed to death by other teenagers? The most usual excuse for carrying a knife is the person needed it for protection.

I very much hope he is prosecuted. Presumably he wasn't carrying it to make his sandwiches with! He must have intended to use even if in self defense. Even if he isn't violent, it could have been taken from him and used to stab him or somebody else. |`|Fhjc0xbAaa	I'm sorry to tell you it is a crime.<br>  Lets hope this lesson saves his life.  When you see how many young lives have been lost in the last year alone in the UK.<br>  <br>  Young people should be encourage to tell on the bullies that are frightening them at school.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	It sounds to me as though the knife can be classed as an offensive weapon as you have said he was carrying it because some boys were after him. That is an offense and he can be charged with it. <br>  You need a good lawyer.|`|aRkYiXtGaa	yes he can, there is no excuse for carrying a knife, if one carries a knife then others will follow, its a vicious circle, and if you carry a knife then you should take the consequences, juvenile centre or whatever comes|`|AA11755900	A lot of this actually depends on how big the knife is...if its over 3.5 inches total length then yes he could be convicted...but i would expect it to be not much more than a misdemeanor, depending on where you live...|`|ALxvsSWiaa	No, not in Scotland. It's official policy to let any under 16 off with a warning, unless it's rape or murder. Then it would go to court.|`|AA10711210	Yes. It's a crime. Outcome? Don't know; may depend on whether the bench had a good breakfast.|`|1wbZTCksaa	dude hes f.u.c.k.e.d i'm srry but they take that serious hes lookin at juvie and on top of tat he can be charged as an adult srry|`|OykWHoxkaa	uh, if he's being charged, damn straight he can get convicted. What would be the point of the charges otherwise?|`|7cegxTbFaa	im sorry yes he can|`|J8mlIt4Naa	Yes i'm afraid he can and will probably get a 3-6 month sentence tho if your lawyer is good he will appeal it and will get out same day. If you had asked this question 18 months ago then i would have said no he would escape with a warning but in the current climate can you expect anything else?<br>  <br>  UPDATE:- When you reached the age of 10 you probably didn't realise you had reached the age of criminal responsibility. Until the age of 10 the law says that you cannot be held responsible for a crime.<br>  <br>  Between the ages of 10 and 14 you can be convicted of a criminal offence if the prosecution can show you were aware that what you were doing was seriously wrong. For example, the case of Jamie Bulger, who was killed by two 10 year olds, was based on this principle. The prosecution showed that the two boys knew that what they were doing was seriously wrong and they were given prison sentences.<br>  <br>  After the age of 14 the law considers you are fully responsible for your actions in the same way as an adult. As such you will be treated as an adult in a court of law in terms of criminal responsibility (although not in terms of sentencing).|`|iEKeixLOaa	Like most cases, it depends on yours state laws. <br>  <br>  Yes, he can receive charges for the knife. But, the charges can be different depending on several things. Size and type of the knife are big factors. Including the fact that is was taken to a school. Now-a-days that has become a big "no no". <br>  <br>  Where I live, any knife is considered a concealed weapon if it is over 3 inches long. Also Butterfly and switch blades are illegal. If he threatened anyone with it it could be considered felony menacing.<br>  <br>  Another factor could be the Judge he gets and whether or not it's his first offense. He could get charged or put on a diversion program.   <br>  <br>  I hope for the best out come for both of you. It's a hard lesson learned. |`|vY1JRrj6aa	Yes I believe he can be convicted, however if there is no previous record or the knife was not used in a violent crime the punishment would probably be very light, from community service to probation.  I would ask a lawyer or the crown if the minor finishes his punishment and there are no futher run ins with the law that it be removed from his record.|`|8pF38UxYaa	was the knife used by him?<br>  If not you should get a very good lawyer and fight this because i believe that this is an unfair trial and your son is fully innocent the way that you worded it. you might want to be a little more specific. <br>  But good luck at the trial and i hope all turns out well for you and your son in the end.|`|sGf4Bii1aa	Depends on the jurisdiction you live in and what their laws are for carrying a concealed weapon (I am assuming he was not waving it around was he?) <br>  <br>  As long as there was no "Intent to inflict injury" on another person, then he may get a slap on the wrist and a fine... if he threatened someone with the knife, he could get a harsh penalty depending on the laws in your jurisdiction. You may want to search your local laws instead of asking on Yahoo... |`|5235d0a6d802361fc1541ef6b4e8c99eaa	What makes you think not?  There are places in this country where possession of a knife is against the law, such as on an airplane, in a school, in a court of law, etc.  Please don't tell me you didn't know this.  Ignorance of the law is not an excuse.|`|Gh8tMBsEaa	yes, he can. i have prior convictions, including one for having a knife, on my record. but it will all be exponged (sp?) when i'm 18. <br>  <br>  theres a special program that kids under 18 can go through, though i forget what its called. the oaaresting officer would reccommend it.|`|jbZzCKxEaa	Its not a big deal and you're definately overreacting and being over controlling of your son. I've carried a knife on me since I was 15. Fight it to the teeth, and tell him to hide is knife better.|`|fHEXSgh4aa	He has to prove to the jury that there was no mallicious intent behind him carrying a knife, but chances are his motives will likely be called into question.|`|WskGIE5Caa	i would suspect so but they would probably need more Evidence and they would have to know it was him/her i think that they can be convicted butnot thrown into jail that would be reall harsh.|`|2HZTrvmbaa	Definitely.<br>  Carrying a knife at any school is a major no no.<br>  |`|1mL6UYMaaa	of course he can, ur doing a great job as a mum by the way. Im sure ur son will go to university and get a degree.... nah just joking pull ur finger out and maybe he wont end up in jail!|`|FclrmREraa	they definitely can one boy is still away after like years for that|`|bf1e8ef08639f4b769fc13b0cda2926caa	Im sorry to tell you, but as you've probably guessed he can be convicted.<br>  <br>  Reading your additional details, he was in possession of a prohibited item with the express intent of using it. <br>   <br>  In the UK the current climate, knife crime is particularly looked down on and my advice would be plead guilty early on and mitigate to the factors that he was a stupid kid and it was a heat of the moment thing and he is sorry, this may not negate some form of custodial sentence.<br>  <br>  In respect of his passport status he committed a crime here and therefore will be tried and can be convicted in the country the offence was committed.<br>  <br>  I will not lie that it will stay on his criminal records forever, however, it does not completely ruin his life, if he gets his life into order. A stupid mistake at 15 is not completely held against you.<br>  <br>  I would hope that you have expressed the extreme ramifications of his actions had he actually used it, it merely takes one stab to end a life, this could have been far worse than possession of an offencive weapon.<br>  <br>  Delays in the case will make no difference, as he is being asked to attend the police station in order to be arrested, many trials can take up to 2 years without any problems.|`|iRd7DYRLaa	Yes, he could be convicted even at 15 or 16.  You will have to show why he was carrying a knife, but also in the same way show that you don't condone your son having a knife.  You may want an attorney if you can afford one, but the key answer is your son willing to admit that carrying the knife to school was wrong and you have no intentions of ever breaking that law again as he understands there are other ways to deal with the problem other than with weapons?<br>  I wish him the best, be on your best behavior and make sure he is well dressed and acts with his best behavior.  Demonstrate to the judge that not only is this out of character for your son, but also that he has learned an important lesson and that he is willing to settle differences without weapons.  That is what the judge is going to want to hear.  They don't care about excuses as much as whether this event changed our son's life for the better and how it changed his life for the better.
7o3DMzXQaa	i highly doubt that congress would approve something like that... it's kind of like how they "approve" raises for themselves, but you never see them approve pay cuts. accountability is a fairy tale in the world of politics.|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	Not very likely, it’s a great idea but why on earth would Congress pass a low that restricts themselves. Historically governments restrict and interfere with the lives of citizens, not members of the government.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	that's generous!   think about the money they can steal from the taxpayers in two years!  every  2 weeks wouldn't get the job done!  if  Diogenes went to DC;  he would return empty handed!|`|BJERgbM5aa	Not only that, but since they're not, Maybe someone should audit the auditors!|`|DAMZKbpDaa	How do you know that they're not? The IRS isn't going to tell anyone if they audit someone.<br>  <br>  A lot more people go through a "computer" audit that most people believe. The audited, if nothing looks suspicious, never even realize. If there are "red flags," the IRS will ask for supporting information.<br>  <br>  It is illegal to audit someone based on political preference, and to have a mandatory audit of politicians seems to me to violate that law.

You should call the cops, and let them deal with it.... You also have a right to pursue a civil action, obtain a judgement and make her pay for the damages....  You should also look at your state laws in reference to protection of property..... Texas for example, you can use deadly force for the protection of property....

hOD1NA7Xaa	I hope not, McCain does not represent change, he may print it on signs, chant it at rallies but he does not represents change. He has no clue what middle class americans are going through and honestly neither does palin. His recent take on the economy was insight into his true beliefs, he said things are fine and he thinks things are fine. He agrees with the Bush tax cuts and will keep them. He likes war we will stay at war. This is not change. He supports the gas tax holiday knowing it will only save about 38 bucks, he said maybe they could use the money to buy pizza? Are you serious?|`|AA10090799	I want McCain to win but Im afraid Obama will.  He has many worshippers and followers...kind of scary.  Did you see the Obama kids video?  Creepy.  Im sure Obama is a nice guy but there is something not right about the way people speak of him and worship him like he is some kind of a god.  He hasnt even done anything yet.  Its bible prohecy being fullfilled.  Yes, Im afraid Obama will be the next president.|`|2wp6uSAAaa	yes its all media hype about obama being in the lead...polls conducted by groups like acorn should not be trusted after all they were caught adding names that were not real.|`|SC5Ds0ofaa	maybe in his dreams.|`|AA11952957	No doubt about it.|`|7HEZhx46aa	No. Which is a good thing, because the LAST thing this country needs is a President Palin. She's toxic and he should have known better.|`|hJiWqnf5aa	He's not coming back from any where. He won this race the day he was nominated. He is being rewarded, for his years of dedicated service. That's how things work in Washington. Maybe in 20 years, Obama will be rewarded too. But, don't hold you breath. Democrat for McCain/Palin 2008.

ASXeYOjAaa	Liberals are divided on this. There's variation on the details but on basics there are 3 groups.<br>  a) Their belief is upside-down. ONLY people lacking these things could possibly have earned them.<br>  b) Huh? (they're too dumb to understand the question)<br>  c) They're wanna-be dictators who aspire to control who gets what.|`|9EW08emXaa	Yes. Yes they do. <br>  <br>  Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness ... they just forgot the "pursuit" part.  They will soon find out that it doesn't make you happy when someone just GIVES you happiness.

That sure sounds like they are ready for their handout from the Messiah to me. <br>  <br>  Perhaps instead of wanting to get a better tax return, when one doesn't pay taxes in the first place sometimes, they should be more concerned with handling their own affairs and recognizing what needs to do be done in their own lives to better them instead of waiting on someone else to do it for them.|`|I0PnftNKaa	no.. obama can't. obama takes money from people who lives in USA as a tax. some he keep. some he steal. and left over the rest, he shares with his own people/ colleague.

A few years ago many Minnesotans made an error of judgment when they cast away there ballots for another "showtime dandy".   For many it was a protest vote against the "Suits" that were running for that governorship.   Well, Jessie the body won and although the bumper stickers were funny, "My governor can beat up your governor" Minnesotans were glad to see ole Jessie hit the trail at the end of his term.   Al Franken falls smack dab into that same scenario, outsider, lived in Manhattan for the past 20 some years with a house here in Edina, Minnesota.   Coming home to "Roost" his spot in the Senate and all will be good and funny for Al Franken, joke again will be on the faces of Minnesotans.    Members of his own party, have challenged his character to represent the state of Minnesota.   He made his living as a comedian out of state, good at what he does and tried his had at politics here and there..    Air America I believe?   That went down like a lead balloon not to mention his on going tax issues, constant references to his rather "salty" writings.    Oh well, Minnesota has demonstrated an ability to make fools of themselves before so I suppose it's not out of the question that "Frankenstein" will be going to Washington but not on my vote...|`|Us2UnLHUaa	Yes.

I don't live in Minnesota, but used to listen to his radio show on Air America -- I was very happy when he announced he would be running for the Senate position.

Not because Obama is black but because of all the empty promises he has thrown out to the american people. And stealing from the rich to give to the poor promotes laziness. I see it all the time and trust me Canada isn't perfect. But taxing big corporations is going to equal big job losses for americans. Companies are going to move where they make more money and pay less taxes.|`|AA11559018	Republicans aren't the only ones who dislike Obama. You forget about the Libertarians, the members of the Green party, etc. I personally know of several Democrats who did not vote for Obama, (one is a racist, but the other 5 are business owners who know what his policies will do to the country)|`|n1mvD8IWaa	No, I am not going anywhere.  I'll spend the next 4 Years explaining to people why voting for Obama was a bad idea, and while we're feeling the repercussions of his agenda; I'll explain to people why they're under the circumstances they're in.  I'll inform people who to get out of it, and I personally will CHANGE as many AMERICANS as possible back into people who actually have some integrity on the matter.<br>  <br>  If he does away with guns, I'll be one of the first people to stand up, and point my rifle into the air, and pull the trigger.  For as long as possible.<br>  I won't give up on you!!!  There is much for the Liberals to learn, and not much time.  I can only wonder what it's going to take for America to wake up, but I personally WILL NOT have my rights to own a gun taken away from me.  <br>  <br>  I can't do anything about the economy, I don't control taxes in this country; but spreading the wealth is about the dumbest idea I've heard in a while.  Does he not realize how many people he's going to hurt by doing this.<br>  <br>  All of the employers, has he considered them?  How much is going to be on their minds?  The repercussions of such an action will force employers to get rid of employees.  People that don't get enough incentive to work will stop working.  Welfare Recipient numbers will go UP, and Tax Rates will Go UP because of it; with more and more incentive being lost.  Driving us into an even bigger Economic Mess.  I won't support it.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, giving people a reason not to work is a REALLY BAD IDEA.  How do you think we've come so far?  The F-22 Raptor, The Automatic Shifting Vehicle, The Space Shuttle, Nuclear Submarines.<br>  <br>  People realized there was progress to be made, and that with the United States Economy, there was incentive to work for such an idea.<br>  And America supports a presidential candidate who wants to TAKE THAT IDEA WAY?<br>  <br>  The ideas that Barack Obama has presented to the United States have been appealing, but the things that people live for, that they strive for, are all going to vanish because our economic system cannot promote them.  How do you expect us to get anywhere with a president like that?  No Technological Advancements, so now; other countries will have an edge over us.  No reason to be creative anymore, you won't gain anything for creating it anyway; nor will you have the inventory to do so.  Living in general will become harder, how do you expect to buy food if Welfare can't even support you?<br>  <br>  THINK ABOUT IT AMERICA.  QUIT BEING DUMB AND WAKE UP!!!!!<br>  |`|dehzwM7baa	I liked Obama until I found out he supports afterbirth abortions. You should google after birth Britons and see who you just voted for.

ee14e206dbb372dcb6ac973cd2828e69aa	    My answer is opinion only. Hue and Cry would possibly work in very small towns, while the current systems of police departments would have to be in place for larger towns and cities. The problem is that you would have to have a populace that agrees on a set of standards of what is unacceptable conduct. Most people would agree that murder, robbery and criminal violence would not be allowed. Then there are those offenses which people just cannot seem to agree on such as public drunkenness, loitering and loud noise. All of the previous items are against the law in almost every community, yet they generally ignored and not enforced. How would they be handled under a Hue and Cry system? How would a Hue and Cry community handle drug and physical abuse which most often happens out of public sight?<br>      My answer then is that each system works best for its time period and location. Just one more piece of opinion; I believe Hue and Cry would have worked well at the time it was in existence because the largest proportion of the population had strong moral standards and a course of action was therefore clear. This is the problem for the Police Departments of today, that although there are laws on the books, much of the population only wants them applied to other people while they choose the ones they want to obey (i.e. speed laws).|`|ujwituRUaa	Obama wants to change the Constitution and reinstate the draft to promote his new world order:

There you think, wrongly of course, the crap in your little rant.<br>  <br>  She is very knowledgeable of the issues as proven in her debate with Joe Baldin.  She is extremely competent to do her job as VP and MORE qualified to be president than Obama.  She is a skilled executive as Governor and an executive is what the president is.  Dishonesty is not an issue since no politician holds the wholly grail on that one.  Her support is not shrinking at all.  Palin rallies are turning out more people than Obama's.  In fact, Obama rallies are shrinking.  The American voter is finally starting to come around about the real Obama and you will see the polls (for those of you who think presidential election polls are accurate) tighten up considerably in the next couple weeks.|`|0686e457a634ce1e335c836cdfa1f056aa	Her support may be shrinking but she still has A LOT of supporters and that absolutely amazes me.

Covert operations to under-mind the current political leadership by an outside political force - large percentage.<br>  3.

Actions perpetrated by one party to blame another to start a war for the profit of either or both of the weapon suppliers. - small percentage<br>  <br>  It has been in the news several times all over the world.

M2XQMPNNaa	To me he looked like he was just barely keeping his infamous temper in check. The sheer force of trying not to explode was resulting in lots of jaw clenching. This guy is a ticking time bomb who inspires 0 confidence in his ability to handle the stress and challenges of the position of President. He is desperate, and desperation brings out the worst in people. His wild antics have been on full display this past week, he is all over the place as far as what he says and what he is doing!! I mean, what on earth was that whole "suspending my campaign" nonsense!! He not only didn't suspend his campaign for even 30 minutes, he caused nothing but problems in Washington until finally he was told to take his publicity stunt somewhere else because he was making it harder for the people actually trying to work!! McShame is a dangerous, unstable candidate and this country can not afford for him to be anywhere near the white house.|`|QWLNBtUeaa	He showed utter contempt for Obama, it was a disgrace.  If he behaved like that towards world leaders your nation would be disowned.|`|SdAil0TSaa	I sure hope he would be the same. He is very level headed.

This is a World War between Islam and Judeo-Christian civilization. <br>  <br>  And the key, the hinge to it is that we have the life’s blood of the developed world, the West, sunk in the middle eastern fields. And it is because of that life’s blood being there that I predict that you will see the people today who would not want their sons and daughters to be drafted, I give you 2 years, 2 to 2,5 years, those same people, many of them will understand they have to send their sons and daughters to the Middle East because if new east becomes unrevealed and the origin oil source for the West is suddenly in doubt, and your oil costs 200 $ per barrel, so much so that your economy cannot survive, you cannot even fill the trucks that feed your town, you cannot fly in the air, everything stops. <br>  <br>  If there is the threat of that, I can see Bush and people of this country, left or right, getting the lowdown saying: “Folks, this war is now becoming battle for the survival of our way of life!” <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  And when that happens, people will drop their intelligence, people will drop thinking of how they got in this mess, and they will soldier all along and rally with the President and their culture. <br>  <br>  You will see even Europe sending many troops in the Middle East because their oil is also cut-off. <br>  <br>  I have always sensed that first stages of this 27 years war will be about the resources of oil… <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  If you do not like this future scenario talk to your government, talk to your representatives. Be that Mercury force that can make our President listen to reason rather then listen to imaginary gods that he thinks talks to him… <br>  <br>  |`|bf1306ac2536db7c2247e7068c58b896aa	I agree totally, he understands the needs of citizens more than senator Obama.

pglTZOi3aa	While it isn't what I want, I believe it's going to be Obama, but I think it'll be a lot closer than most people suspect.  There is a strong anti-republican sentiment in the country right now, which is where Obama gets most of his edge, but McCain has some things going for him too.  The demographic that has some of the highest voter turnout tends to be white senior citizens, who grew up in a time when African Americans were not put in leadership positions.  While it isn't a stereotype I hold to, I think it's a hard viewpoint to turn against.  Personally, I think that there will be a higher voter turnout than usual and most of those who vote that normally don't will go for McCain, but I don't think it'll be enough to beat Obama.|`|KdFiVGTRaa	OBAMA!!

LPO8RlVdaa	Because many people who are NOT racist (despite what the left wing liberal fascists would have you believe) have been driven to the BNP because the mainstream parties will not listen or give them a voice over genuine concerns on issues such as immigration, the failure of multiculturalism and the rise of ethnic groups and in particular, the section of those ethnic groups that are extremist. The BNP give them this voice. If the Conservatives decided to find a backbone and fight for these issues then the BNP would lose a lot of support to the conservatives.<br>  <br>  Another point to make is that regardless of wether you are a policeman, a nurse, a teacher, a doctor, or anyone working in the public sector, you still have the undeniable right to believe and think whatever the hell you like. You can hold any political views you like. This is still a democracy, despite the recent witch hunts against the public sector workers who vote BNP. 99% of those people in public sector jobs are able to hold certain political views and still perform their duties proffessionally and impartially.<br>  <br>  I would like to add as well that the policeman being suspended (and there will be many more) stinks of rank hypocricy. The Police force is an inherently racist force, but not against minorities as many people think. It allows an association of Black Police members, it has an open policy of positive discrimination, and so on.

So if the world does end in 2012, then there's nothing we can do about it.

That doesn't mean the world will end.<br>  <br>  The mayans were intense geniuses, and I think they calculated at that moment that the planets would reset to the position at their year 0, so the whole calendar would restart. They used the calculator a lot for astronomy.<br>  <br>  And you know, X Files doesn't really count.<br>  <br>  I'm going to give a resounding no.

They'd use human sacrifices by ripping someone open on a stone slab and TEARING THEIR HEART OUT WHILE IT WAS STILL BEATING!!!<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure we had saner people predict the end of the world.<br>  <br>  2. The Mayans were conquered by Spain<br>  <br>  You know, if a civilization can predict the end of the world with such pinpoint precision, they'd be able to see invaders coming from a mile away, right?<br>  <br>  WRONG!<br>  <br>  They were absolutely crushed by the spaniards. Perhaps they should've used their uber-clairvoyance more wisely.<br>  <br>  3. Planet X (or Nibiru) won't do us in<br>  <br>  I guess the most common arguement for the end of the world is that Planet X is gonna mosey up by us and kick us all to the curb. Thankfully, that can be diusregarded as a bunch of baloney.<br>  <br>  First off, any kind of object the size of Planet Xcan be spotted if its arriving here in 2012. If it can't be seen and its arriving in 2012, then its moving so fast that it defies all logic.<br>  <br>  Second, the theory that Planet X is a brown dwarf is also sketchy. Sure, we can't see them with the naked eye, but we have infared scopes that do sight them. If there was anything like Planet X coming near us, we would know.<br>  <br>  Good source of Planet X-disproving info<br>  <br>  4. A polar shift won't slaughter us either<br>  <br>  Okay, let me just say this and get it out of the way: Polar shift is only a theory, not an actual scientific law.<br>  <br>  Second (and the biggest point), a polar shift doesn't happen all of a sudden. It actually takes anywhere from about 500-MILLIONS of years!<br>  <br>  Oh, and let's not forget that NASA even says a polar shift won't happen.<br>  <br>  Who're you gonna believe, some crazy doomsayers or NASA?<br>  <br>  5. A solar flare won't bake us all<br>  <br>  Another false claim is that a giant solar flare's gonna jump out of the sun and make fresh baked cookies out of us.<br>  <br>  Ye....No.<br>  <br>  First off, there's something called the Magnetosphere that protects us from these sort of things by absorbing (and, in most cases, nullifying) the effects of any radiation that comes from a solar flare.<br>  <br>  Second, the sun would have to be a red giant before it could produce something of that magnitude. Thankfully, it'll be a long, loooooooooooooooooooooong time before it reaches that stage.<br>  <br>  Besides, the intensity of the flares are at an all-time low and I don't think it'll shift into overdrive in 4 years.<br>  <br>  6. The Mayan calendar had a bad numbering system<br>  <br>  The sheer amount of thought it takes to fully understand this complex numbering system is so great that I think it doesn't even end in December 2012.The way they counted back then was so convoluted that I think e Mayans drew this system up to confuse people in the future.<br>  <br>  In fact, there's even more after December 2012! If the world is supposed to end in December 2012, WHY IS THERE MORE DATES AFTER THAT!?<br>  <br>  7. The Mayans didn't say the world would end<br>  <br>  What most people overlook is that December 2012 wasn't noted as the end of the world by the Mayans. It just meant that the world would be entering a new age. In fact, that "new age" they're talking about might even be one of prosperity! Maybe we'll all be happy and gleeful for eternity once the calendar turns to this month! YAY!!!<br>  <br>  ...Or maybe they were still working on it when they got steamrolled by Spain.<br>  <br>  -----------<br>  <br>  So, there you go: 7 reasons why the world won't end in 2012.<br>  <br>  You can put the tinfoil away now.|`|rnFebL9zaa	i think no, but if global warming and other environmental stuff keeps going on its a maybe but everyone wants to live to 100 ( i think ) and scientists say antarctica is melting but i believe not.

f7d83c762cb406c908e27d40d488f350aa	I've been following this story since it's early days on the website that originally did the analysis/research at <a href="http://texasdarlin.wordpress.com/." rel="nofollow">http://texasdarlin.wordpress.com/.</a> After bloggers on this website (which is, by the way, started by a democrat) began to wonder why all the stalling in showing his birth certificate, they were very skeptical when he finally posted the certificate of live birth on the Daily Kos website and his fight-the-smears website. The investigative blogger (Texasdarlin) and several other smart bloggers did an amazing job researching the legitimacy of the birth certificate and researching the sequence of events in Obama's life--much of which came from his own writings as well as other interviews and articles. They concluded that the certificate of live birth (which is not a birth certificate--no one has ever seen a copy of his full length birth certificate) is a forgery.<br>  <br>  They then used deductive reasoning to conclude that either he is hiding the fact that he was, in fact, not born in the US OR that his current, legal birth certificate is, in fact, the one he got when he was adopted by his Indonesian step-father and therefore, his current legal name is Barry Soetoro. This would mean that he is probably still an Indonesian citizen and may not have ever gotten his US citizenship back. Berg picked up on all the blogs they had written to support their argument, which was impressive, and moved it into this lawsuit. If either assertion turns out to be true, then Obama will not be eligible to be president and we will have been witness to an amazing con of the American people. It is now becoming obvious that Obama has something to hide or else he would have done what John McCain did when his birth circumstances were questioned--bring out the full length birth certificate.<br>  <br>  In addition, all this has brought to light the gaping hole in our national security that exists surrounding a presidential election. First of all, the FBI does NOT do background checks on sitting US Senators before giving them a security clearance. Although the constitution states the requirements of eligibility to be president, it is NO ONE's official duty to check to make sure the candidate, in fact, qualifies. It's all based on the candidate signing an affidavit declaring himself qualified. NO ONE checks up to see if they are lying! And once the election starts, no one wants to be the one to question the integrity of a candidate (even one from Chicago!) so everyone tiptoes around the issue.<br>  <br>  If he is disqualified, it will come as a huge shock because the only way anyone will have heard of this is through the internet.<br>  It has all been amazing to watch this unfold and realize that the mainstream media is SO in the tank for Obama that none of them would even report the lawsuit. Of course, documentation supporting this may be what the McCain campaign has been holding back as the rumored "October Surprise".  Oops-sorry--I guess I wasn't brief like you asked for but it's a complicated topic...<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|6JQUIZFTaa	There is no new news, just gossip.  I do not believe that Obama was born in the USA.<br>  <br>  Obama Crimes<br>  ALERT: Contrary to Internet Rumor, No Court Ruling Yet On Obama / DNC Motion to Dismiss in Berg v. Obama <br>  Wednesday, 01 October 2008 23:50 administrator   I received a phone call from Phil J. Berg  a few minutes ago. He informed me that a rumor is circulating on the Internet that the Court has ruled on the Motion to Dismiss filed by Senator Obama and the Democratic National Committee in the Berg v. Obama case. Some of the visitors to this website have posted comments claiming the Court has ruled. The comments on this site were written by visitors to the site.<br>  <br>  On Mr. Berg's behalf, I am posting this to state clearly the Court has not yet ruled on the Motion to Dismiss in Berg v. Obama.<br>  <br>  Here's the status:<br>  <br>  Last week Senator Obama and the Democratic National Committee filed a Motion to Dismiss the Berg v. Obama lawsuit.<br>  On Monday, Mr. Berg filed an answer requesting that the suit not be dismissed and that the Court order production of documents proving Senator Obama's consitutional qualifications to serve as President of The United States. <br>  As of 1 AM EST today, October 2nd, 2008, the Court has not ruled on the Motion for Dismissal in Berg v. Obama.<br>  Obama Crimes Webmaster ''<br>  <br>  Why does Obama need this kind of a lawyer?<br>  <br>  Just In: OBAMA is USING TERRORIST’S LAWYER to Defend Against Berg’s LAWSUIT <br>  <br>  Via yidwithlid. OBAMA is USING TERRORIST’S LAWYER to Defend LAWSUIT <br>  Here come another of those “Guilt by Associations” that Senator Barack Obama will try to weasel himself out of. As you may know, Philip Berg is suing Senator Obama in Civil Court. Berg wants Obama to Produce his real birth certificate to prove that he meets the citizenship requirements to be President. Rather than just product the birth certificate (is he trying to hide something? Did you notice he didn't even try to show that lame forged facsimile he's got posted on factcheck and kos and smears to the judge?) Obama’s legal team filed a motion to dismiss. One of the Lawyers filing the motion was Joe Sandler ( sandler@sandlerreiff.comThis e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it ) of the Washington law firm Sandler, Reiff, and Young (see the document below). <br>  <br>  If Mr. Sandler’s name sounds familiar it Should. He is the Legal Hit Man for the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). CAIR is an organization with terrorist ties, and has been as an un-indicted co-conspirator in the Holyland Foundation Hamas Funding trial. <br>  <br>  Sandler’s role for CAIR has been to stifle people from telling the truth about Islam. For example, last year he tried to get Jihad Expert Robert Spencer banned from speaking to the Young American Foundation, by using a threatening letter. Sandler followed up by threatening columnist Mike Adams for writing about the Spencer incident. <br>  <br>  Look, everyone deserves legal representation that is not the Issue. The real issue is why is a candidate for President of the United States, a guy who wants to take over the role of Commander-in-Chief in the war on terror, using the Lawyer for CAIR a group with terrorist connections, to represent him in a law suit? Once again the Junior Senator from Illinois leave us with questions and no answers.|`|PrsWmUSDaa	A couple weeks ago, I read on Yahoo News that somebody in Philadelphia is taking him to court, claiming that he was actually born in Kenya and not in the US, and that he also has or had citizenship in Indonesia.

Berg, Esquire, of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit on Thursday seeking a Declaratory Judgement and Injunction that Barack Obama does not meet the qualifications to become President of the United States. In the lawsuit Berg alleges that Obama is not eligible for the presidency because he is not a naturalized citizen, and/or lost his citizenship when he was adopted in Indonesia, and/or has duel citizenship with Kenya and Indonesia.<br>  <br>  Berg said that he has filed the suit on behalf of the Democratic Party and citizens of the United States for their best interests. Berg, an attorney with offices in Montgomery County, PA and an active practice in Philadelphia, filed the lawsuit, Berg vs. Obama, Civil Action No. 08-cv-4083, in Federal Court.<br>  <br>  In the filing Berg says:<br>  <br>  There have been numerous questions raised about Obama’s background with no satisfactory answers. The questions that I have addressed include, but are not limited to:<br>  <br>  1. Where was Obama born? Hawaii; an island off of Hawaii; Kenya; Canada; or ?<br>  <br>  2. Was he a citizen of Kenya, Indonesia and/or Canada?<br>  <br>  3. What was the early childhood of Obama in Hawaii; in Kenya; in Indonesia when he was adopted; and later, back to Hawaii?<br>  <br>  4. An explanation as to the various names utilized by Obama that include: Barack Hussein Obama; Barry Soetoro; Barry Obama; Barack Dunham; and Barry Dunham.<br>  <br>  5. Illinois Bar Application – Obama fails to acknowledge use of names other than Barack Hussein Obama, a blatant lie.<br>  <br>  If Obama can prove U.S. citizenship, we still have the issue of muti-citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegance to other countries. <br>  <br>  Berg goes on to make very direct accusations against Obama, stating that he "lied and cheated his way into a fraudulent candidacy and cheated legitimately eligible natural born citizens from competing in a fair process." <br>  <br>  Interestingly, Obama isn't the only one who's citizenship has been questioned in this election. John McCain's citizenship was also questioned because he was born on a military base in the Panama Canal Zone, which is not a US territory.<br>  <br>  The full court filings and claims can be found at ObamaCrimes.com, Berg's website. Philip J. Berg is the former Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, former candidate for Govenor and US Senate in Democratic Primaries, former Chair of the Democratic Party in Montgomery County, and former member of the Democratic State Commitee.<br>  <br>  This filing comes less than two weeks after an AP photo was revealed of the school register of a child then known as Barry Soetoro, now known as Barack Hussein Obama, whose citizenship was listed as "Indonesian" and whose religion was listed as "Islam." the photo strongly contradicts the Obama camp's claim that he was not a Muslim, and is said to confirm he is a national of at least one other country.

A democrat in Pennsylvania sued in court for Obama to prove that he was born in the US. If not he is to prove his loyalty oath was signed.

Obama has sought to have the case dismissed, yet the court ruled yesterday that he has 3 days to turn over the documents. <br>  <br>  My suspicion is he has something on the original (like notation of a defect or VD, that he does not want public, otherwise why not just provide it?

Us2UnLHUaa	Sad, but true.<br>  <br>  It is a little brother/big brother thing. Canadians feel disrespected by Americans, so they respond as a defense mechanism. Americans, for the most part, know little about Canada and it annoys the hell out of most Canadians. Canadians know everything about America and there is a mixture of awe and disgust about what is seen. It is a love/hate relationship from the Canadians perspective, which is very similar to an American liberal's view.<br>  <br>  Obviously, I am a Canadian. I love America, although I understand and sympathize with some of the feelings of my compatriots. In most ways, Canada and the USA  are family and I will always give family the benefit of the doubt.|`|LAPl7EDBaa	Americans often make two fatuous assertions concerning how people in Canada feel about America and Americans, and why they do. <br>  <br>  Specifically, that Canadians: <br>  1.are characteristically anti-American; <br>  2. are anti-American because they are envious. <br>  <br>  Regarding #1 – anti-americanism: The 2005 16-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey (see: <a href="http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=801)" rel="nofollow">http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php...</a> shows that: <br>  <br>  1. Only The Poles (Poland) had a more favourable view of the United States than do Canadians. Moreover, Canadians held an even more positive opinion of their southern neighbour than did Britons -- who had backed the American-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, while Canadians wouldn’t. <br>  <br>  2. The consensus of favourable opinion in Canada towards “Americans” per se, as opposed to “America” itself, was the third most favourable polled (66%). Only Britain and Poland scored higher. <br>  <br>  Regarding #2 - envy: Canada is a G7 country. That means Canada is not only a model democracy, but by numerous measures, one of the seven most successful societies in human history. Depending upon one’s criteria of ‘more successful’ -- GDP per capita, longevity, access to quality education (primary, secondary, post-secondary), or absolute economic and military power -- then the US and Canada tend to switch their relative positions back and forth within the Group of Seven (now called: G-8, to include Russia as a 'courtesy', though they don't really qualify for membership). In short, Canadians don’t lack for much that’s available in America, nor regard US perceptions of 'shortfall' as anything worthy of envy. <br>  <br>  So, I hope I have cleared up the record, to show that: (i) Canadians are neither inherently anti-American (are perhaps less so than most people), or, (ii) envious of  America.  The latter view is a defensive rationalization, in fact. <br>  <br>  Let's take an opportunity to discuss why our political outlooks are distinct. History defined attitudes that still resonate on both sides of the US-Canada border: Americans are largely unaware that for the first century and a half of their country’s existence relations between their forebears and those of their northern neighbours were indescribably bad. Firstly, in the late 18th Century, once The Revolution was for them ‘lost’, The Loyalists (usually called “Tories” in US history) suffered greatly, being driven northward out of America as the result of brutal lynchings, property confiscations, or both; secondly, ‘Manifest Destiny’ later saw a militarily aggressive America attempting to acquire the territories where The Loyalists had successfully re-established themselves, either by force or threat of force. Bunker Hill (1775) and The Siege of Baltimore (1814) resonate in American souls each time the US anthem is played or the New England Patriots win the Super Bowl; likewise, Canadians still take pride at raising militias which stood against The US Army during 1812-15, and for defending itself against a mercenary force of a US based, probably US armed, “Irish Army” that invaded Canada after the US Civil War (see: “Fenian Raids” <a href="http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-2999-e.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confe...</a> <br>  <br>  Furthermore, the CIA World Factbook declares that Canada ... " resembles the US in its market-oriented economic system, pattern of production, and affluent living standards".  Though market oriented, Canada can differ from America as to the extent that government may intervene in economic affairs to regulate markets.  The difference arises because Canada was largely founded by persons who were "Tory", people who believed governance could beneficial, if well managed. America, on the other hand, has been "Whig",  inclined to repudiate intervention and regulation by governors -- at least until the sub-prime mortgage crisis and Wall Street meltdown happened. These differences explain why America's founders referred to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" while Canada's 1st Constitution enshrined "peace, order and good government" as the bedrock of democratic freedom. <br>  <br>  No one should forget their history, it should not prevent people from moving forward constructively, nor be any excuse for ill manners or grossly ignorant behaviours. <br>  <br>  FOOTNOTE: here’s why, IMHO, Americans find Canadian criticisms of America particularly galling: <br>  <br>  1.Americans have a belief that their country has a unique role in history. Whether that viewed is shared by most, many or just a few other countries is neither here nor there: what is important is that Americans believe it to be the case. America is certainly the most potent country in history, economically (still) and militarily, which makes it the object of much criticism. Furthermore, because they love their country, which has many great achievements to boast, Americans are hyper-sensitive to the magnitude and tone of criticism thrown towards it due America's current position as the world's only hyper-power (for now, at least). <br>  <br>  2.Unlike even 30 years ago, our deeply interconnected digital world enables criticisms of America to register immediately, irrespective of from where on the Globe the source comes. This effect is less important for countries that interact in languages other than English: Americans can seldom read comments made in foreign languages, and seldom receive translations through their own media. Most Canadians, however, speak English – even those whose first language is French. Thus, every criticism of America by a Canadian TV or newspaper journalist can have immediate impact, often negative; ditto for any Canuck crackpot posting on the blogosphere. (Remember, too: the internet often attracts crackpots, largely because the interaction is remote, anonymous, and usually without consequence). <br>  <br>  3. common origins plus the fact of shared language and lifestyle causes most Americans to regard Canadians as “cousins”** -- perhaps anachronistic cousins (i.e. constitutional monarchism), perhaps retarded cousins -- but “cousins” nonetheless. Moreover, Americans are largely unaware that a difficult historical record stands between them and Canadians. Thus, any criticism of American actions or policy from a Canadian source tends to be viewed as a kind of inter-family betrayal, especially resented, thus rationalized away as the product of ‘envy’ or ‘liberalism’ (usually, only if the complainant is a ‘Republican’). <br>  <br>  ** Americans tend to regard Canadians as “family”, largely unaware that the view is not really reciprocated. For example, I live in a town frequented by American tourists: one often hears US visitors declare “[they] don’t see Canada as ‘foreign’ nor Canadians as ‘foreigners’”. Canadians tend to regard Americans as “neighbours” in a North American community, however, rather than “family”, largely the resonance of 18th and 19th Century history.|`|hiCSVwchaa	Possibly because they know the difference between "they're" and "their."|`|ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	Maybe they can spell?

Also, what kind of a sentence would you propose for a person serving a life sentence who kills another prisoner, or a guard? Make him serve 2 life sentences? And, by the way, "murder" is a legal term, not a moral one. One who commits murder has violated the law, clearly not the case for one who performs a legal execution.|`|AA11719145	Here is my opinion: It's a little long, but I hope you'll do me the courtesy of reading it.    The problem is your interpretation of the Commandment "Thou Shalt Not Kill".     The Commandment "Thou Shalt Not Kill" is incorrect. This Commandment was given to Moses on Mount Sinai along with the other 9 Commandments while the Israelites were wandering in the desert during the exodus from Egypt. The account of this was written by Moses in Hebrew and is recorded in the Old Testament Book of the Bible.     Now, most people already know this. But what most English-speaking people do NOT know is that when the Hebrew texts were translated into English for the King James Bible some of the Hebrew was mistranslated. Ask any person who speaks Hebrew and they will tell you that. When you read the Old Testament in the original Hebrew, that Commandment reads "Thou Shalt Not Murder"...not "Thou Shalt Not Kill"...and here is why that difference is important:    In English, the word "kill" and the word "murder" mean the same thing. But in Hebrew, there are different meanings for the words "kill" and "murder". They mean 2 different things.    "Murder" in Hebrew means to take a life wrongly. "Kill" in Hebrew means to take a life justifiably. How can taking a life be justified? That is the whole issue of your question. In war, when a Soldier takes the lives of his enemy, we do not call that murder. It is the taking of a life, but it is justified....right? There is the difference between "murder" and "kill". According to the Old Testament, it is justifiable to put a murderer to death. It is the justifiable taking of a life. So, according to the Ten Commandments, the person who executes a murderer is not a murderer himself.     I used to feel the same way you did, until I began to study my Bible after learning Hebrew. I am not Jewish - I am a Christian - but I did want to learn Hebrew to better study the Old Testament.     Ask your pastor about this. Ministers and Pastors are often taught Hebrew while earning their Theology degrees.     Thank you for reading my answer.|`|bpBbO8mWaa	I completely agree with it, they killed an innocent person then they can die themselves. If you let a murderer live, they could get out of jail after 20yrs-who's to say they won't kill again?|`|Ebh0T9ncaa	I believe that if you murder someone or rape a child; figuratively ending their life, you deserve to die.  You can argue against the ethics of why its okay for the state to kill but not for an individual but if taking one scumbag off the streets prevents many more people from dying then why not?  Aside from that, look at it from the fiscal side.  It costs about $40,000/year of our tax dollars to incarcerate those deviants.|`|gRvHucPPaa	I totally agree with Rick.  I think you would sing a different tune if someone that you know, mother, dad, sister brother, got murdered.  Do you turn the other cheek for that?  What happened to an eye for an eye?

That being so, the judicial system sometimes finds people guilty "100% beyond any possibility of doubt", who turn out later to have been innocent all along, despite DNA (not always available anyway), wonderful investigation techniques and the best judicial system in the world.  Unless the state can devise a way to bring back from the dead those innocent people it has murdered in the name of justice, it is just plain wrong to have a capital punishment available.

Also, what kind of a sentence would you propose for a person serving a life sentence who kills another prisoner, or a guard? Make him serve 2 life sentences? And, by the way, "murder" is a legal term, not a moral one. One who commits murder has violated the law, clearly not the case for one who performs a legal execution.|`|AA11719145	Here is my opinion: It's a little long, but I hope you'll do me the courtesy of reading it.    The problem is your interpretation of the Commandment "Thou Shalt Not Kill".     The Commandment "Thou Shalt Not Kill" is incorrect. This Commandment was given to Moses on Mount Sinai along with the other 9 Commandments while the Israelites were wandering in the desert during the exodus from Egypt. The account of this was written by Moses in Hebrew and is recorded in the Old Testament Book of the Bible.     Now, most people already know this. But what most English-speaking people do NOT know is that when the Hebrew texts were translated into English for the King James Bible some of the Hebrew was mistranslated. Ask any person who speaks Hebrew and they will tell you that. When you read the Old Testament in the original Hebrew, that Commandment reads "Thou Shalt Not Murder"...not "Thou Shalt Not Kill"...and here is why that difference is important:    In English, the word "kill" and the word "murder" mean the same thing. But in Hebrew, there are different meanings for the words "kill" and "murder". They mean 2 different things.    "Murder" in Hebrew means to take a life wrongly. "Kill" in Hebrew means to take a life justifiably. How can taking a life be justified? That is the whole issue of your question. In war, when a Soldier takes the lives of his enemy, we do not call that murder. It is the taking of a life, but it is justified....right? There is the difference between "murder" and "kill". According to the Old Testament, it is justifiable to put a murderer to death. It is the justifiable taking of a life. So, according to the Ten Commandments, the person who executes a murderer is not a murderer himself.     I used to feel the same way you did, until I began to study my Bible after learning Hebrew. I am not Jewish - I am a Christian - but I did want to learn Hebrew to better study the Old Testament.     Ask your pastor about this. Ministers and Pastors are often taught Hebrew while earning their Theology degrees.     Thank you for reading my answer.|`|bpBbO8mWaa	I completely agree with it, they killed an innocent person then they can die themselves. If you let a murderer live, they could get out of jail after 20yrs-who's to say they won't kill again?

BIQrsl4paa	Yes, the Army definately promotes faster than the AF. I'll use myself as an example: I made E7 in 9 years and knew AF E6's with 18 years that were still hoping to make E7. Additionally, the AF is the only branch where an E5 is allowed to stay in long enough to earn a retirement.<br>  So, while it is true that the AF lives in somewhat nicer barracks and never has to sleep in a foxhole, I'd much rather put up with the inconveniences and get paid more, than the other way around.<br>  Additionally, the Army will guarantee you a specific job, whereas the AF usually will only guarantee a career field or, more likely, an open contract.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	In the Army you go to a boardm but you must be recommended by your SGT, in the air force you must take a test, I don;t know if you have to be ecommended for that test, you may want to ask your dad, I had problems in the army gettign recommended for the baord, even had to go to IG or EO because no one would recommend me for the board. <br>  I do hear that the test is harder to pass in the AF then going to the baord in the army.

4VzVfKvdaa	No mechanical background? Hmmmm...well, it's a good job anyway once you learn what you are doing.  The crew chief can be thought of as one of the most important jobs in the air force.  They basically know nose to tail all of an aircraft's systems and they literally "own" an aircraft.  The pilots just borrow them from the crew chief.  Next time you look at the names on a fighter and see if it is an enlisted guy or an officer. Without crew chiefs, there would be no air force. As for you fear of heights, it depends on the aircraft you are assigned whether you fly or not, but it is still a great job.|`|0fc72d23b6a968354c2c0fc32ac9056aaa	wow that other guy was a little light in the pants....a crew chief has to do a bunch of stuff on the plane , pre flight checks in flight checks post flight checks cabin prep-which means get things ready for the piolts, do what the piolts tell you to do, after all they are in charge of the aircraft, prepare loads coming on and going off the plane, and im sure there is a whole other list but that is the basics, dont worry though- your joining the airforce-you guys dont really do alot of work|`|AcWMpmPwaa	basically, once you finish your training, you'll be assigned to a squadron, you'll do some training on whatever aircraft they need you on and from there...you'll get a plane...and it's yours!!! you make it what it is. yes it can be a thankless job but it can also be pretty rewarding. i'm not sure if this is how it's done now it's been 30 years since i was in. we used to call crew chiefs 'tire kickers' but w/o them the plane goes nowhere just like my career field... inertial nav/radar specialist!!<br>  <br>  added note...if they give you choices, try to stick with fighters, they're a lot more fun to work on and there is nothing more orgasmic than listening to the sound of authority when they light off the after burners!!!<br>  <br>  hey icearmy2...you're a funny guy...i busted my backside when i was in, like i said i don't know how they do it today. but you're right, the c/c has a load of work to do, but you make your job what it is, right!!|`|m5J36D28aa	He is responsible for all of the maintenance on his aircraft while it is on the ground.

S3ktbzDNaa	Cities are always more liberal the rural areas. This year, suburban voters are among the biggest swing voters.<br>  <br>  Bill Maher offered a theory: on the coasts, where people are forced to actually talk to each other, people tend to be more liberal. While there may be something to that, you should probably take most things that come out of his mouth with a grain of salt.<br>  <br>  However, exposure to different types of people does make people more liberal on average, which you see far more in major cities, especially on the coasts, and in few places more than my home town of NYC. Many people who move here do become more liberal, but not all. The reverse happens sometimes for people who move to more conservative areas. When people around you talk about politics one way, many people can be swayed over time. Also, many of the people who choose to move to NYC (like my mother) are already more liberal than people from their home states (Ohio in my mother's case).<br>  <br>  A lot of people who move here are well educated and/or artists, both of which tend to be liberal groups. And those who grow up here (like me) grow up in a liberal city with many different kinds of people and lots of exposure to different points of view (most of which are different degrees of liberal), which tends to make us more liberal.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Alden Brown, you misunderstood my town based on your cursory research. Like southern democrats, New York republicans are not nearly as conservative as their counterparts in other states. Bloomberg, our current mayor, is now an independent. He was republican when he was elected, but basically switched parties from democrat to win the primary and then got elected largely on the strength of a Guiliani endorsement right after 9/11. As for Guiliani, the city was in crisis when he got elected and Guiliani beat an ineffective democrat on the strength of his experience as a prosecutor. He was popular in his first term because we needed someone who ran the city as a police state. He was unpopular in his second term because we no longer needed that, but he ran the city the same way. He would have left office with very low approval numbers if it weren't for 9/11. The man knows how to handle a crisis, but little else.<br>  <br>  Other than Mayor, we almost never elect any republicans in NYC. Our city counsel is 51 members with 48 democrats. Two of the three republicans are from Staten Island, a republican stronghold within NYC. For most Citywide races, winning the democratic primary guarantees you the office, often unconstested.<br>  <br>  As for the state level, most of the state (other than NYC) tends to go republican, but again, it's New York republican, much more liberal than the rest of the country. On national elections, we're solidly blue. The New York Metro area has about half the population of the state. NYC itself has 8 of the state's 28 million, but when you factor in Westchester and Long Island, it's about half. That half includes some areas far more republican than the city and the other half includes a few regions that are pretty liberal, but overall, the state is split about 50/50. Our state assembly has been democrat for years and our state senate has been republican for the last 70 years. That may change this year. Most of the republicans in congress from New York are behind in the polls and in our state senate, the republicans are right on the cusp of losing their majority (could go either way). Regardless, it doesn't reflect on NYC.<br>  <br>  As for the Obama stickers, most New Yorkers don't drive, we take the subway. The cars are either cabs, who rarely put stickers on, or they are from New Jersey or upstate. Of the ones that belong to New Yorkers, we see little reason to put political bumper stickers on our cars when our state is never in contention in national elections.<br>  <br>  I have campaigned for Kerry 4 years ago on Wall Street. Yes, there are conservatives there and they outnumber the liberals, but the liberals gave enough money to Kerry to make up for their smaller numbers. The financial district has a lot of cash, but it is a very small portion of the NYC by numbers and it is not solidly republican by any stretch of the imagination. I have worked their and campagined there and know it well.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Most larger cities in the US tend to be liberal.  The Republican party likes to court the agricultural and small town interests (farm subsidies, for example), while the Democratic party is more concerned with city issues (crime control, housing, and so on).<br>  <br>  It's the same thing in California.  Of the 58 counties, the vast majority vote Republican.  But the 8 or 10 that regularly vote Democratic have the majority of the population.  |`|8Kmp90JDaa	Large cities are usually multicultural and diverse with many educated people. Because the cities are so diverse, people are who live there are more accepting of "different", which basically makes them a liberal. The majority of intelligent people with a good education, almost always vote for Democrat's. The exception is extremely rich people, such as CEO's of oil companies, who vote Republican to keep the rich richer and the poor poorer.<br>  <br>  Also, a lot of people in the south and the midwest are very religious, and unfortunately, a lot of them involve their religion with their politics which results in a lot of right wing Republicans from those parts of the country who try to rewrite our constitution and turn it into a Christian theocracy.|`|caefe9fcecf0459fc50d20cbc39f206faa	I asked this same question of a young lady - fellow passenger on a flight into JFK - and she glared at me. Politely, anyway. <br>  <br>  She ensured me that most in the city who bother to vote, vote Republican. <br>  <br>  A better question, though, would be, "If we bother to vote at all, and given that our power to vote was won for us by fearless Revolutionaries who insisted that only by scar of the occasional Revolution would these liberties survive, WHY are we so docile, fearful, shy, pitiful, self-condescending, spring-loaded to silence, etc as to find strength ONLY in shutting up the discussion of Revolution?"<br>  <br>  ...|`|3tLW7fZQaa	Multiculturalism and education are liberal things...<br>  <br>  a liberal has a worldview.<br>  a conservative has a neighborhood view.<br>  <br>  you will notice that the main blue areas of the map are always heavy urban areas, massive GNP, etc...red areas are alot of farmland, alot of xenophobic viewpoints, etc.|`|f7KKrMJvaa	They've been duped <br>  <br>  If your looking for real America don't bother looking in NYC|`|gu6MtWt8aa	Its Separation of the Haves & Have nots.Haves (Mostly Republicans) move to suburbs the Have-nots(Democrats mostly) live in the city on top of each other like sardines in a can.

I kinda wonder how on earth Rudy Giuliani ever became mayor.|`|GhIw1mGxaa	people in nyc arent as liberal or democratic as you think. the mayor has been a republican for the past 14yrs. the governor of ny from 95-06 was also a republican. many of the immigrants are also republicans because prior to moving to the us, they know they are moving to a right wing country. in addition to most of the immigration applicants being right wing, the us govt also has certain standards as to who they let in or give visas to. they usually give them to right wing republican types. so in the end, most of the immigrants in nyc and other parts of america are right wing. nyc's main industry is finance. people in finance or driven by finance are usually right wing, so thats another reason why so many new yorkers are right wing. many of the new york immigrants i have met went to the u.s. specifically for capitalist reasons, and are thus right wing. many of them were also accepted into the u.s. for their right wing, or republican views. for example, you get certain russian jews in new york that speak out against russia, and socialism. the us thinks to itself, great, now we can have some russian citizens that can speak badly about their own country and show the world how bad russia is. they accept many chinese citizens under the same pretenses. the u.s. also took in a lot of right wing cubans that spoke badly about cuba. the same goes for venezuela. you also get alot of these indian guys who work 60 hours a week. you think they want to give their taxes to the govt? of course theyre going to vote right wing. capitalism and republican go hand in hand. democrats are also capitalist, but republicans are more extreme. ny is also an expensive place to live, meaning most of the people who live there have a bit of money. youre talking about $1100 a month for a 1 bedroom in the ghetto. the voting trends are- if you have money, you will vote right wing.  if you drive around nyc, you dont actually see that many obama stickers. i actually saw more of them in vermont, which is a rural state.

[la cai è nata male....e sarà servita su un piatto d'argento al partner internazionale]<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  certo è stata colpa dei sindacati....ma anche di berlusconi....perchè prima nn è intervenuto con i sindacati come ha fatto adesso? insomma ha fatto la prima donna senza averne la capacità......<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  guarda ho viaggiato parecchio con alitalia e ha fatto sempre acqua da tutte le parti....attese lunghe, hostess antipatiche......e nn ho viaggiato poco e nn solo in europa.... ti posso solo dire che cathay pacific la batte 10000 volte a uno.....perchè devo pagare di più per avere un servizio pessimo? è sempre stato un fallimento viaggiare con alitalia....anzi nn so com'è durata a così lungo.....uno spende i soldi per i servizi offerti, per la cortesia, per la qualità dei servizi e mi pare che molti offrano servizi migliori.....ma quando mai potrà essere migliore di etihad? insomma alitalia sta pagando il disastro provocato dai suoi amministratori...nessuno è stato mai all'altezza! <br>  <br>  p.p.s. tu credi che un nostro businessman voglia partire con cai quando questi della cai hanno detto che ci saranno pochi voli settimanali internazionali e verso pochissime destinazioni? loro puntano molto sul volo tra milano e roma....pensano in piccolo e guadagneranno in piccolo! poi con la recessione e con il crollo dei fatturati dei big lei guadagnerà? sì, tre calci nelle parti basse!|`|ltwWdbutaa	Questo problema ha portato alla luce una realtà che era nei sottofondi: i sindacati italiani. <br>  Spesso, quando un'impresa è in crisi, arrivano loro a rovinare tutto. Non fanno realmente il bene dei loro lavoratori, ma li fanno del tutto rendere disoccupanti, facendo aumentare di tanto il costo di produzione e togliendo dal mercato concorrenziale le nostre imprese italiane. Questo era successo negli anni '80, e si ripete oggi. Le imprese estere sono "intimorite" dai sindacati italiani: una volta che assumi un dipendente, è impossibile licenziarlo. E' un bene? no. Primo, si fa in modo di non "educare" il lavoratore, facendo credergli che è suo diritto far il meno possibile per aver uno stipendio. E secondo, non si tenta nemmeno di incentivare il lavoratore, ma lasciarlo li con il suo stipendio senza possibilità di migliorare in quell'impresa. <br>  <br>  Tutte le imprese pubbliche sono naufragate: Enel, Sip, Fs, Alitalia, Scuole, Ospedali e Sicurezza. Senza dimenticare il servizio offerto dai pompieri. Di queste imprese, quale è stata un "successo"? E visto che la risposta è "nessuna", perchè si vuole testardamente continuare su quella strada che ci hanno regalato bilanci mostruosi, con consecutive crisi finanziarie italiane? Non pensiamo nemmeno a cambiare sistema?<br>  <br>  L'Alitalia, dati alla mano, aveva circa 4volte il personale di AirFrance, e delle altre compagnie aeree, pur avendo ricavi inferiori ed offrendo un servizio peggiore. Se la Cai, volesse cambiare traiettorie imprenditoriali, farebbe solo bene. E' impensabile pagare personale inefficiente, e tenere i bilanci in negativo. La Cai ha solo una possibilità di risollevare l'Alitalia: diminuire i costi della filiera diminuendo il personale e delle rotte  (in quanto gli altri costi sono fissi[ e quindi non modificabili nel breve periodo], come costi degli aerei), aumentare le qualità dei servizi e puntare sulla ricerca e sulle nuove idee. <br>  |`|w32OBRFAaa	hai ragione è ora di dire basta alle proteste inutili dei piloti non ne posso più invece di dare atto alla CAI che sta salvando la nostra compagnia di bandiera (anche se è già fallita) loro la vogliono far fallire allo scopo di rimanere tutti senza lavoro,poi oggi a fiumicino hanno provocato l' inferno cancellando tutti i voli e la povera gente che ha pagato regolarmente il biglietto aereo e dovuta stare a terra e chi li rimborsa adesso i piloti?<br>  se si è arrivati fino a questo punto è perché si è detto sempre di no alle altre offerte come quella dell' alleanza con air france e KLM che era la cosa migliore ma adesso bisogna guardare avanti e remare dalla stessa parte della CAI che è vantaggiosa anche per i piloti ed è normale che qualcuno deve essere sacrificato poi diciamoci la verità tra i dipendenti Alitala ci sono molti raccomandati che non sanno fare per niente il loro lavoro e a differenza delle altre compagnie aeree l'Alitalia è quella che ha più dipendenti cosa che non si può permettere |`|PR4tYsR1aa	Si infatti, è assurdo!<br>  Avrebbero potuto perdere tutti il lavoro, e invece che tirare un sospiro di sollievo e tirarsi su le maniche in un momento difficile, in attesa che tutto torni alla normalità (perché solo lavorando tutti insieme possono tornare alla normalità) rendono la situazione ancora più complicata!|`|Y6Cza3ycaa	Sinceramente io assumerei da subito piloti stranieri,e quelli Italiani a casa senza la cassa integrazione,che fra l'altro la paghiamo noi con i nostri contributi,è proprio una vergogna anche per tutti noi Italiani.|`|A1AkOs8kaa	non saprei<br>

b1c45661beb2a8e1f192d241d65240cfaa	The term libertarian today refers to a person who supports freedom in both economics and in personal issues. The term "populist" means different things to different people but people who claim to be "populists" mean that they support the general population as opposed to people they consider elites. The term "liberal" today means different things to different people but usually refers to "left liberals" or people who support freedom in the personal sphere but not in the economic sphere.

gasquENMaa	What you are asking for is called a criminal background check. Most prospective employers will request this themselves ( with your written permission) if they feel it is needed, but to answer your specific question:<br>  <br>  You can stop in at your local police precinct or sheriff's department and request a BCI check. This is a state wide background check. Either department can do this for you. You will be fingerprinted at that time and will need proof of who you are ( driver's license ). The cost is usually $18-$20.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and you can find it useful|`|026407cde2bc8691b34593dbabae7e6eaa	you have to go to the clerk for the jurisdiction you were arrested in (county, district, municipal, etc.) and request it.

EAjTiYj0aa	It's a difficult issue.<br>  <br>  I am basically pro-choice as I think that the woman must have the right to decide-she is the one who's pregnant after all.I am certainly in favour of it in cases where the child would not live long after birth or where having the baby would probably kill the mother.Also of course in situations where the pregnancy is the result of a rape-though I know some women do choose to keep children that result from rape and that is their right of course.<br>  <br>  What does concern me about abortion and the way it's often used (at least here in the UK-it may be different in other countries) is that many people seem to see it as just another form of birth control as if it were no different to condoms or the pill.This encourages some people to not bother with other forms of safe sex which isn't helping with the control of sexually transmitted illnesses so I think the attitude needs to change.Having an abortion to end an unplanned pregnancy should be an option but that doesn't mean you should think you don't need to worry about safe sex.<br>  <br>  I'm male and aged 26 (well 27 in one week lol)|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Not really, but there are circumstances where it is right.<br>  <br>  52 female with a daughter who is a very young mom.|`|LIpCGz4oaa	yes it has to be ok. first of all. there  are too many people on this planet. <br>  32 and female<br>   babies should be born to  loving caring  parents. that is a mum and a dad. both with the concerns of the child uppermost in their minds. a child should have a caring loving upbringing.<br>  i would not give birth to an unwanted baby.|`|OR8hrr0aaa	nope, unless the mother or baby's life is really at risk.|`|4zKmOkI4aa	no,but i love all of my kids.|`|oojO4WAraa	51 F - I think in some cases it is okay.  Abortion should not be used as birth control.  There are just cases in life where, because of medical circumstances or life circumstances, abortion is the best option available.  <br>  <br>  Birth control ought to be readily available and schools should teach comprehensive sex education so that abortion isn't necessary because of stupidity or accidents.  But ther are medical reasons, and rape, and other situation where the woman should be able to consult her physician and decide what is best for her.  |`|kvWF1a2Yaa	For me morally I do not approve.

I know for myself if I found myself pregnant now I would abort the baby why because I had a horrific birth with my last child then I had serve post natal depression where I had thoughts to harm my new born baby and myself,  I have taken steps never to get pregnant again because of my experiences but for this moral question say I did find myself pregnant then I know I would abort because I could not put myself or my children through that again.<br>  There are circumstances where a woman does have a valid reason for wishing to abort but there are women that use abortions has a contaceptive which it is not. <br>  I think the question should be at what week should an abortion not be performed.|`|TxC6Fry0aa	ok?? no, not really....but neither is proscuting women and doctors, throwing yourself down the stairs while pregnant, or using coat hangars....I think the choice of allowing abortion is moral....I wouldn't personally have one, but I haven't personally been raped, so I don't know that that wouldn't change my opinion.<br>  <br>  I DO know that there are thousands of unwanted children in the system currently and millions around the world who need families. Not only are they underfunded and undercared for....but they are often forgotten in this 'moral equation'. If we are AGAINST abortion, we must demand that these children are cared for and fully funded until at LEAST age 18.....the fact is, the same people who are against abortion are the exact same people who are against welfare, medicaid, and other social services for our poor.<br>  <br>  <<30, Female, Foster Mommy through Child Protective Services.|`|X3PmWPUraa	there is no right or wrong over abortion.  Women choose to have abortion for a number of reasons and many of these are not those anyone would want to go through ie, rape, incest, mother's life is at risk, ectopic pregnancy - that is just some examples.  As the woman has to carry the baby and take the risks resulting from giving birth - even in Western societies women do die during childbirth.  Do we force a woman to go through with a pregnancy and possibly have to have an operation if necessary to deliver the baby?  No one can make that choice other than the mother.  It is her body so her choice.  Whatever views people have, they do not have the right to put them onto anyone else.<br>  <br>  Female, 40s|`|Qqj1VTmXaa	When two people have sex without any form of protection they are both fully aware that one may get pregnant and as such should be responsible for that birth regardless of their circumstances. The basis of our existence is because our mothers gave birth to us so abortion goes totally against those principles. <br>  The actual act allowing abortion was the Abortion Act of 1967 which arose out a Private Members Bill introduced by David Steele (later leader of the Liberal Party). This set out that abortions were allowable under specific circumstances (physical or mental health of the mother, condition of the foetus etc.) with strict time limits. It was never intended that abortion on demand (e.g just because someone couldn't be bothered to use contraception and found themselves pregnant) would be made legal by this Act but the situation has moved further and further towards this in the years since.<br>  |`|72248a32d1dd27455d195b25e247cb66aa	I think its a personal choice, it is however a choice I would not make myself, but to make abortion illegal would just lead to "backstreet abortions" as in the days of old when someone would claim to be able to do the operation and many women died as this was not the case.

That baby could grow up to do many things, and you're taking that away from the baby and the world.<br>    It is a human being. Just because it's not in the world yet doesn't mean it's not. Abortion should be illegal. It is murder. Not just killing, it is murder. It is taking one's life. It sickens me that in some states you  can get an abortion at up to 8 months pregnant. But I don't care if the woman is 5 days or 5 months. I don't care if you're 10 or 20 or 35. It's wrong.<br>    It's not the baby's fault the parents weren't smart enough to use protection, and even still. Sex is a responsibility.

If a woman wants to exercise her right to choose for her own body, she can choose to remain celibate or use a reliable form of birth control if she doesn't want to become pregnant.  If a woman chooses abortion to end an unplanned pregnancy, she is not making a decision for her own body only, but for the body of her unborn child.  <br>  <br>  There are other times when an abortion may be indicated if the life of the mother or child is in danger or in the presence of incest or rape.  While still a moral question, I think the decision should be left to the people involved, including a doctor and counselor.<br>  <br>  I'm a female  and let's just say I'm old enough!

I'm female, 24, currently living in the UK.<br>  Why?<br>  I fail to see how the 'rights' of an unborn fetus that is not viable outside the womb, that has no consciousness and is far from being a baby could possibly come before the rights of a fully grown woman who's life could potentially be ruined by a pregnancy.<br>  I do not think of abortion as an easy way out, it should not be used as a contraceptive so to speak, ie. I don't think it's alright to screw around without protection and then get a load of abortions because you behaved unresponsibly. However I do believe if you behave responsibly, use contraception to the best of your knowledge, to everything to prevent getting pregnant and end up pregnant anyway, in that case it is a valid last way out.<br>  Some people do not want to have children, should they be forced to remain abstinent for the rest of their lives on the off chance that they may become pregnant and can't do anything about it?<br>  Sure there's adoption but that is not going to give you 9 months of your life back, 9 months that may ruin your job, your health and superficial as this concern may be, your figure.<br>  Furthermore, there are already too many people in this world, it's overpopulated and we are doing serious damage to the world, do we really need to bring more unwanted children into this world when there are so many parentless children already?<br>  Abortion has always happened and will always happen, making it illegal just means more people will come to harm doing it.<br>  Just a side note, I personally believe male opinion on abortion is completely and utterly irrelevant. Yes, it is their sperm that fertilised your egg, but they are not going to be dragging it around with them for 9 months, they are not going to be affected by the pregnancy, they will not have to give birth to it and they can always bugger off it gets too much for them.|`|WSqJ26uCaa	no no no NO on so many levels i can't even explain in this small space because i'll be here all day typing. under NO circumstances whatsoever is abortion ok. period. end of story. bye bye.<br>  female, 16|`|cSif7PNNaa	Male - 18<br>  <br>  In general: no<br>  <br>  However I would condone abortion for reasons not related to convenience, i.e. health risk to the mother, rape, severe disability of child.|`|lXY4leHuaa	15 Male, I think it is ok, I only think it is wrong to kill sentient, conscious beings, young unborn children are not as far as i know.|`|12k69N6Yaa	I dunno, sometimes - if the baby is un-wanted and is going to be born into a hateful enviroment....<br>  but probs only in the early stages of pregnacy..<br>  <br>  =) hope thats helps wid ur hw<br>  <br>  13, female|`|4eaad6a567061722003ccb0606251d45aa	NO I would liken abortion up with king Herrots slaughter of the innocence.       female  45|`|8jca3WYlaa	age 16<br>  gender female<br>  <br>  Abortion is ok if the child is at risk or has a chance of a sh*t life,,,<br>  |`|JBHlQ1KTaa	Not at all, or under any circumstances.<br>  BTW, fifteen year old sophmore girl.

Of course, the problem with traffic tickets is that even if you are in the right, it cost's more to fight it than it will to pay it.  It will probably be a 200 hit for the ticket and then 100 a month extra (I think reckless driving for a teenager will put you in high risk) on your insurance for the next 3 years, so figure 3800 total cost.  Probably cost that or more for a lawyer.

VUgCSQ6Daa	She is partially correct. The 3 groups I blame are the Government for relaxing the rules and oversight on lending, The Lenders, for pushing the paper so aggressively, knowing they were bad loans, and The Borrowers, who leveraged themselves beyond their means and took the loans that they knew they couldn't afford.|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	YES - Predatory lending should carry MOST of the blame.<br>  <br>  I used to work for a non-profit agency.  My job was to PROTECT people from Predatory lending.  Unfortunately, not everyone that was preyed upon would go through a program like ours.  I worked through HUD's HOME Program that helped low income families get into RESPONSIBLE home ownership.<br>  <br>  I STOPPED some of these loans.  The PROBLEM was that we were NOT ALLOWED to call them Predatory lenders.  We were not allowed by LAW to tell these people that the lender was preying on them and giving them a rotten deal.  The only thing that I could do was tell them that I thought they could get a better option from a certain list of lenders that I knew were legitimate.<br>  <br>  The victims really are not always in a position to take the blame as much as some people may want to believe.  Sometimes these people did not seek out the loan in the first place.  They were often under educated, lied to, elderly and immigrants that did not understand all the jargon, the lenders would SCARE them into thinking that if they were to "shop around" for a better rate, it would hurt their credit (that's a lie)<br>  <br>  So if Palin thinks Predatory lending is a huge part of the problem, then I have to agree with her on that.  <br>  <br>  Those of us in roles working directly with the targets of these loans saw it coming long ago.<br>  <br>  I had a family whose lender let them refinance their home once a year before we stopped it.  (The lender called them up and offered it to them)  They owed $85,000 on a house worth no more than $50,000.  They kept refinancing to pay off the bills they couldn't afford and kept digging deeper into the hole.  They were immigrants who did not undertand exactly what they were doing.  When we got involved, we put a stop to it.<br>  <br>  I can go on with stories.  But I'll stop there.<br>  <br>  The CEO's and other officials of the Predatory lenders should have to pay every cent they earned back to the people... from their own pocket... then they should be put in jail.<br>  <br>  Even if people applied for loans that they could not afford, the BANKS should never have approved them.

They capitalized in a way unconscionable to most people. They thought the housing boom wasn't anywhere close to ending, so they rode the wave of greed and relative certainty until it hit the beach. They were willing to deal with people with risky credit because of the ultimate possession of the house. ("A house in my possession is a house not in my competitor's possession.")

As a person who has accounting experience, who has been in the financial world for a very long time, I can tell you these things and be confident in their reality and their factuality.<br>  <br>  1.  The markets are controlled.  Traders and Companies can suspend trading when there is a run on the market.  Therefore the huge drop in the market was blackmail to force us to bailout the bad guys.<br>  2.  The USA is bankrupt.  We don't have $250 million let alone $810 billion to bail out wall street or even our own taxpayers.  All that money is financed -- it is borrowed from other countries and other sources.  When they "call in those loans"  they control our government and our finances.  China has threatened to shut down our economy and I believe that they are in league with Dubai and a consortium of other governments to do exactly that. <br>  3.  The Democrats (and the Republicans) for that matter know that if they can create a crisis, they can control the elections and also provide for an excuse to fail when they can't deliver on their promises.<br>  After the November election, we will no doubt have a new Treasury Secretary and we have no idea who that will be or how he/she will carry out this bail out plan.  We have played into the hands of Economic Terrorists and sold out our country.<br>  4.  I listened to C-Span a week or so ago when the Senate interviewed both the Presidents and CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  When asked exactly what the cash flow of both were, both answered that they had a "positive cash flow".  That confirms to me that this bailout is a sham and a blackmail attempt on the people of the USA by the corrupt politicians, corrupt banksters and corrupt wall street executives.  Further it confirms that the USA is falling victim to Dubai and China and other foreign governments at the hands of our Congress who has no idea how our financial markets actually work.<br>  5.  Since the USA has been bleeding jobs to overseas enterprises, we have no way of doing anything but continuing our downfall unless the people of the USA take it upon themselves to start and run businesses in their own communities and buy and promote U.S. made and purchased goods and services.  Unless we force the hand of government just as they have forced our hand, there will be no end to this economic crisis.<br>  6.  Low doc and no document loans were made to illegal immigrants and those who could not afford to buy homes.  They were sold a "bill of goods".  Meanwhile, those who defaulted played right into the hands of the predators who got their money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and then turned right around and sold the foreclosed homes to huxters who perpetrated the same scam again and then took their money and ran.  They helped the banksters and themselves.<br>  7.  It should be noted that only 4-6% of the mortgages in the USA have been in default.  That means that 94-96% of the mortgages are being paid.  That draws into serious question the government's figures and the need for a bailout at all.<br>  8.  Asset backed securities (CDOs) are worthless paper.  They are made up of some legitimate mortgages, bad debts and credit instrument bundles (like car loans).  The mortgages are already insured by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government as well as Private Mortgage Insurance and others.  As a result, Wall Street and Bank and Mortgage Company greed was responsible for those same assets being "valued" at least twice -- once as a legitimate mortgage and then again as a security.  The security was sold on the market and when it went into defaul or the bad debts could not be collected upon, the security couldn't be churned or sold any longer.   That means that a crisis was created because the banks and investors were sitting on a great deal of worthless paper that they should have known was worthless to begin with.  Those securities should have been given a "G" rating instead of an "A" rating.  <br>  9.  Insurance companies and banks and even mortgage companies are limited by law as to what kinds of instruments they can invest our dollars into.  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation guarantees our retirement portfolios so again, they are backed by the full faith and credit of the USA government.   So, I'm telling all of you that failure of the government to regulate and oversee the use of these financial documents and failure to enforce the laws is the true cause of this crisis.  We the people have been insured 100% before today for most of our assets -- at least the common people have because we don't have more than $100,000 in any bank and because our Pensions have been insured and even our life insurance policies have been insured.  <br>  Those of us who truly understand the markets and the finances know that this whole situation is not as critical as the government and the banksters want us to believe.  They just blackmail us by tig|`|zf1Sa6dNaa	Let's get real.  It's called A LOAN.  If you can afford the Loan then you can afford the house.  It's called credit.  But what isn't taken into account is when the "Predatory" loans change and requires means the borrower cannot supply. These loans were being given out based on the market and when the market goes **** up, money is being lost and have to be regained by the borrower and the loans change requiring more=higher rates.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	If you're concerned about taxpayer money, you should be against capital punishment in ALL cases.  It's not even close - it costs WAY more to execute a prisoner than to keep him incarcerated for life.<br>  <br>  It differs by state (in the U.S.), but the reason for this is that the government wants to be as sure as possible that it does not execute an innocent person.  Toward that end, much more is spent on pre-trial preparation (most DP cases take about a year to come to trial), more pre-trial motions, more expert witnesses (on both sides), more attorneys (also on both sides), jury sequestration, security (needed because of more publicity in DP trials), an extra sentencing trial, and an exhaustive appeals process.<br>  <br>  Some think this is why violent crime rates are HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions - because these enormous costs drain resources from police, education, and other government programs that help reduce crime.<br>  <br>  Even with all of these precautions in place, innocent people STILL get sentenced to death pretty regularly.  In the last 30 years in the U.S. alone, over 100 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence.  These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  Many would argue that is the highest cost of all.<br>  |`|AA11206283	I wish you were right. I'm not sure it's so.|`|ajaZr8Axaa	You should do some research.  It costs far more--close to a million dollars--from the process of filing a capital case, selecting a death-qualified jury, through the trial, incarceration, multiple appeals, and finally execution of a single person than it does to imprison that same person for life.  If you want to put forth a logical (ie not emotionally-based) argument for upholding the death penalty, that's fine, but make sure it holds water first.  This one doesn't.|`|2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	It would actually cost more to bring back the death penatly.  The death penalty costs much more than life in prison, mostly because of the legal process, which is supposed to prevent executions of innocent people.  The bulk of these costs are  UPFRONT, before and during the trial.  Just one example:<br>  <br>  “The study counted death penalty case costs through to execution and found that the median death penalty case costs $1.26 million. Non-death penalty cases were counted through to the end of incarceration and were found to have a median cost of $740,000. For death penalty cases, the pre-trial and trial level expenses were the most expensive part, 49% of the total cost. The investigation costs for death-sentence cases were about 3 times greater than for non-death cases.  The trial costs for death cases were about 16 times greater than for non-death cases ($508,000 for death case; $32,000 for non-death case).”  (.

He simply stated the fact that executing a prisoner costs more money than keeping that prisoner in jail for life.

PZKmZ95Yaa	So, when did Obama find out that Ayers..... ?<br>  <br>  had been a member of an organization the FBI called a "domestic terrorist" group, and had been, for years, a fugitive from the law?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Not that there's been any clear explanation of this relationship forthcoming from the Obama campaign.<br>  <br>  So, did he know who Ayers was when he went to his home in 1995?<br>  <br>  Obama and Ayers were a lot closer than just a fundraiser. They spent more than six years working together at the Chicago Anneberg Project and the Woods Foundation. Obama and Ayers oversaw the spending of $100 million dollars from the Anneberg Project over a six year period. Obama and Ayers were board members of the Woods Foundation. Ayers and Obama directed a $75,000 grant to an organization run by the Mona Khalidi, wife of Rashid Khalidi a longtime friend of Ayers and Obama. Ayers raised money for Obama's campaign.<br>  <br>  Obama has repeated this type of behavior with his statements about Reverand Wright. Obama called Wright my spiritual mentor and friend of twenty years. Yet when Wright's controversial sermons came to light Obama changed his tune, saying he was never present when the Reverand made controversial statements.<br>  <br>  What about Rezko. Obama stated "It was a bonehead move" when talking about how he and Michelle paid well below market price for a part of the lot the Rezko's owned next to Obama's new home. Obama had been in the Illinois Legislature for six years, he knew who Rezko was and what Rezko was about. He knew Rezko tried to buy or bully political influence. Heck, Rezko raised $159,000 in campaign money for Obama. Yet according to Obama, it was an innocent mistake.<br>  <br>  Obama keeps changing his story on these issues, just like he changes his political views depending on what he thinks people want to hear. <br>  <br>  So the issue of what Obama knew about Ayers' and when he knew it is important, because it is another example of Obama saying anything, including lies, to get elected. <br>  <br>  And he wasn't aware of who "Ayers" was?<br>  |`|shtP63traa	Because he represents the change we need.<br>  <br>  Why are you scared of change?|`|AA10617196	Those are just the kind the media LOVES! <br>  <br>  If a dem wants to win, they gotta be ultra-liberal then the MSM will help pass them off as moderate or conservative in order to win over the mostly center-right American citizenry.<br>  <br>  And, by George, being a minority just about makes 'em act like cats invited to a fish fry.

It is a SHAME they know nothing about what it took to give them those rights.<br>  <br>  When they lose them.....they might get their heads out of their butts....but it will have been too late.<br>  <br>  People in America believe that "government for the people" means that the government is supposed to do everything for the people. They want to fight the fact that  the Declaration of Independence only gives them the right to PURSUE happiness--they have to catch it themselves. <br>  <br>  Time and time again our founding fathers reminded us that this noble experiment would not work without ethical and spiritual values because a government of the people, by the people and for the people can only be as good as the people. <br>  <br>  The American People are failing our founding fathers and our country!<br>  <br>  I was in the Army for three years I am a veteran and PROUD Of it...I am proud of my country.

Maybe some protests and some looting, remote but highly captured and magnified by leftwing media machinery.<br>  <br>  A civil war would only occur if there were something that violated one of the 'truths we hold to be self-evident". Since most people today can't even agree on what truth is, or even what 'is' is, then I doubt it. <br>  <br>  We are more likely to see massive demonstrations, marches and prolonged protests due to a destroyed economy, loss of jobs, shutdown of industry and the recent sell out of our banking industry by our Congress. Once that reality hits home, and it affects everyone and everything in this country, then who knows?<br>  <br>  |`|9XAqnmOQaa	There cannot be another Civil War.

However, Palin conservatism is not of an "individual", It is a right wing evangelical conservatism that claims individualism, except when it comes to an "individuals" body, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs.  |`|4b99d9999be50b0318aee157c7f60950aa	It's kind of vague.

But in my opinion, she's more of a Conservative than Bush or McCain. |`|nMW6f9fzaa	It is someone who is strong on taxes and very, very right-leaning on social issues like abortion, guns etc. This a different ideology than the "Neo-conservative", huge government, Bush, McCain type of conservative.|`|t92FAGpGaa	True conservative means small government and individual liberty.<br>  <br>  Palin is into socialism for the rich, Religous fundmentalism, and military expansionism.|`|XLCSfrfIaa	That picture is disgusting and I think you need to focus on cleaning up your act before attempting to understand politics.|`|Us2UnLHUaa	It means you are either a hillbilly or a bible thumper....or both.|`|pZSZUhXNaa	compliment.<br>  she's old skool|`|jilrS1FLaa	true conservatives =<br>  <br>  *rejection of communism, socialism, socialism lite, liberalism, liberalism lite.<br>  <br>  *rejection of universal anything (except universal acknowledgement of traditional American moral goodness and American power).<br>  <br>  *rejection of terrorism and terrorists (foreign & domestic).  <br>  <br>  *believing in the restriction of government powers as outlined in the Constitution et. al.<br>  <br>  *still believe that holding US citizenship is a very special privilige.<br>  <br>  *understanding that Western religion is the bedrock upon which the success of our civil society rests (without religion, people have no reason to behave properly)<br>  <br>  *understanding that welfare helps no one, especially the recipient and that the way to prosperity is to work harder than you ever believed you could and to try try again, never quitting.<br>  <br>  *reject slavery in all forms, including that suffered by illegal immigrants by their immoral employers/owners.<br>  <br>  and that's for starters.|`|b79a2a725d502d3e781e988531784711aa	Old school.Basically anti today's day and age.|`|IJTcGIG7aa	At this point......saying you are a true conservative means you have completely abandoned the Republican party, since it has completely abandoned conservative ideals.<br>  <br>  Look....<br>  <br>  Neo-Conservative HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH True Conservative <br>  <br>  The Bush/Palin form of 'CONSERVATIVE' is a spend happy, debt running, nation invading orgy that relies on jingoism, division and fear rather then offer anything optimistic or hopeful about our nation's future.<br>  <br>  Barry Goldwater would be a Democrat if he was entering politics today.|`|gjAZeRyfaa	I luv your picture<br>  <br>  just a compliment|`|3dcf970bfeee9b5095b51cf05b1e82d5aa	It depends on what side of the fence you're on politically.  If you're a liberal you may think that being labelled a true conservative is an offense, if you consider yourself a conservative and are labeled a true conservative then you'll think it's a compliment.<br>  <br>  However, a true conservative is one who politically believes in smaller government, fiscal responsibility (low spending), strong military, and injects moral values into their political decision making.  Sarah Palin fits the bill for most of this, but I wonder if anyone realizes she's not exactly a true conservative because she has done more spending than most republican governors to date.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	compliment! A true Conservative loves small government, lower taxes and respects always the rights and libertys of the INDIVIDUAL!

Marriage will always be a union btw. a a man and a woman, regardless what the law says. Messing with the definition from a legal standpoint, will bring about anarchy and persecution. The agenda they're pursuing here is to obligate the church officials to perform such marriages even if it is against their beliefs and their conscience. This is what the "love is love, I- like- fairness, "i- am - a peace-loving-person" ellen -the- degenerous and the likes of her are really after.<br>  To tell you the truth ,its' not fair to me to have to accept such a imposition on one of the most sacred beliefs I hold so dear.

Qqj1VTmXaa	The scum responsible for baby ps death and other perverts will on entering jail be placed on rule 43 now rule 45 or VP which is vulnerable prisoner, they will be regarded as nonce's nonce first came into widespread use in UK prisons, where it is primarily used by prisoners to refer to convicted sex offenders, especially abusers of children. "Nonce's" are traditionally targets of physical abuse from their prison inmates, and so usually go on Rule 45 (formerly Rule 43), the rule that enables the segregation of vulnerable prisoners from the other prisoners for their own safety. The Rule 45 section of British prisons in which sex offenders are segregated (also known as going on 'The Numbers') is often referred to as the "nonce wing those that work there ie so called prison officers do so by choice and are not liked by other prison staff. This protection system is in place because other serving cons would and do take revenge against these filth which also include rapist and informers i believe that no such system should exist and they should suffer the full consequences of their acts and its a sad day when i have to rely on another serving prisoner to administer justice to these animals, it beggars belief why someone would want to choose to protect these evil bastards.<br>  For those whom have answered no i suggest  you know your facts before you answer.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	No, and nor should you.<br>  As others have said, it is part of the job to look after some really unpleasant people.<br>  Imagine the situation if prison officers could pick and choose.<br>  I, personally, detest drug dealers.

It took six years to defeat them, they were allowed to gain power because the good people in Germany did not stand up and stop them gaining power and authority.  To allow these people into any jobs where they have the authority and power over others would make the sacrifices made during world war 2 meaningless.<br>  <br>  If you doubt what I say look at their website and research their history, they are evil white supremacists and should be seen as such.<br>  <br>  They are allowed the right to form a party and have free speech.<br>  <br>  This ban should extend to teachers as well, I would certainly not let any child of mine be taught by a fascist, you only need to look at history to see what German fascists did when they got hold of young minds.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	I have no time for the BNP.<br>  Having said that, I have absolutely no argument with your point.<br>  "I am a member of the BNP, a recognised political party" -"Fine, you are sacked".<br>  <br>  PARDON?<br>  <br>  "I am Conservative".<br>  "I am Labour",<br>  "I am Liberal".<br>  "I am Green",<br>  "I am Raving Monster Loony Party",<br>  "I am anything else"<br>  <br>  So should we not just disqualify EVERYBODY who has ANY political affiliation from the police force and teaching, and sociall work, and local planning - in fact from absoluitely EVERY possible employment opportunity?<br>  And I do mean ALL of those political, and other, affililiations (or even sporting preferences).<br>  Are you beginning to get a grip on the Orwellian machinations of the state yet?

Being a BNP member is proof that someone is likely to discriminate on the basis of ethnicity.<br>  <br>  I suspect that it is entirely legal to ban BNP members from the police force - the policy has been in place for a while and hasn't been challenged as far as I know.|`|FEiAcj7vaa	I am deeply anti-racist but I feel very uncomfortable about a person losing their job/career because of their political views in a democracy. There was a time when the BNP were just the NF with a new name and were traitorous scum in this society. And many policemen fell into that same catergory, especially in the inner cities. But the BNP (Despite it's racist long-term goals) is now a much more legitimate party in a grass roots sense and many of the people who vote for the party are simply NOT extremists. I think that the police was so riven with racist excrement for so long that they have now gone too far the other way and become ultra-PC, at least in theory, but to some degree in practice as well. It is technically against the Police Code for a policeman to be BNP. I think that this is wrong! If a policeman is demonstrably racist he should be sacked and imprisoned for being a disgusting streak of p*ss. But if he simply votes BNP. or campaigns for the BNP and it does not affect his work, he should surely have the right to express his views like anyone else. It seems even more ridiculous a situation when we have so many BNP councillors (All potentially more influencial than a bobby on the beat) and that is just fine. Fair Question!|`|D3wfxgxMaa	Merseyside police, who discovered the name of one of its constables on the list, identified him and said that he had served briefly as the chief constable's driver. A spokesman said: "We are very clear: membership of the British National party is totally incompatible with the duties and values of the police service and Merseyside police. We will not accept a police officer or police staff being a member of BNP. As a matter of urgency, we have immediately started an investigation into all aspects of this case."|`|8Bl0VUzeaa	I also think one has to question the legality of prohibiting membership of the BNP for certain professions. Whether one agrees with their policies or not surely people have a right to be a member of a legal, recognised political party? Hazel Blears is now calling for a drive against the BNP, with protests and picketing. How is this acceptable and legal? Personally I would vote BNP before I vote Labour.

tGCOBfaWaa	I for one would prefer to see McKinnon charged in the UK and held here. He's fully aware that he has committed a crime, and I genuinely believe his intentions were not malicious, just fact-finding for his own use.<br>  <br>  However, the problem isn't to do with where he's living, it's to do with the location of the servers he hacked into. The US government is arguing that because he damaged property based on US soil, he should be extradited and charged in the US. If he was committing an act of terrorism, I'd be inclined to agree with them, but he's clearly not a terrorist, and the US courts should at least offer some degree of leniency considering his condition.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't go as far as to call the government a bunch of traitors quite yet, it's quite obviously all very political and tied to a law which should have a bit of give when needed.<br>  <br>  I do however think our position with the US is far too close, and some government official with a set of brass iron balls wouldn't go amiss here. Maybe we should start taking some advice from the Russians?|`|60cwSqE9aa	I don't fully follow everything you've written but, while I think the US has a prima facie case for extradition, there are two reasons why it should be refused.<br>  <br>  The first reason is that the possible penalty that a US court could impose. At 75 years without parole, it's disproportionate and I'd describe it as cruel and unfair. For the alleged offence, I'd think the maximum penalty should be less than 5 years in jail.<br>  <br>  The second reason is that this man has Asperger's Syndrome. Having it myself, I fully understand how he could get so engrossed that he didn't realize that he was doing wrong. Intense concentration and fascination are characteristic of this autistic spectrum disorder. Also, the individual sometimes doesn't fully appreciate the implications of their actions. In itself, the US authorities' failure to acknowledge the effects of Asperger's is sufficient grounds to refuse extradition in my opinion.|`|AA12349988	"US foreign policy is akin to government-sponsored terrorism these days...

I don't republican, I vote conservative|`|AA11284831	Politically, abortion was a non-issue until Ronald Reagan latched on to it during his first campaign.  He promised to propose and push through a Constitutional ban on abortions.  It's one of the bell-weather issues that got him elected in the first place.  BUT once in office, he never ventured near it again.  The Republican party frequently trots the issue out as a campaign platform issue then does little if anything to try to move on it.<br>  <br>  The major problem with the Bible is that you can prove almost any point with it.  There are numerous passages that can be interpreted as both endorsing and opposing abortion.  And don't forget that "God" himself slaughtered millions of innocents if you take the Bible literally, such as in the Great Flood, Egypt, and Sodom and Gomorrah.<br>  <br>  This is the reason that the Founding Fathers drew a line between church and state and barred any religious test for public office.  They had just cast off the chains of religious oppression and wanted to assure that it would NEVER be an issue again as they birthed our great nation.  If they returned today and saw what hold religion had on the population and how it was so woven into politics, they would haul Reagan up on treason charges if he were still alive and have him executed.  |`|pElG2K61aa	There are many anti-abortion Democrats on the Hill too.

Vor Somalia liegen ertragreiche Fischgründe welche laut Seerecht zu Somalia geh?ren. Da Somalia über keine Marine verfügt k?nnen die dieses Recht nicht duchdrücken. Das wissen vor allem die gro?en Fischfangflotten aus Italien Grichenland usw. Diese Plündern nun die Fischgründe vor Somalia und die Dortlebenden Fischer deren t?glich Brot der Fang ist bekommen immer weniger in ihre Netze. Also besorgen die sich ein Paar AK`s und fahren bewaffnet aufs Meer und vertreiben die Ausl?ndischen Fangflotten meisten hat dazu ein paar Warnschüsse gereicht. <br>  Nun bezahlen die Internationalen Fangflotten einen Somalier Geld das er sich ein Altes Schnellboot kauft und dieses Ausrüstet und dann auf die Jagt geht gegen die bewaffneten Fischer. <br>  Damit die Fischer sich wehren müssen mehr Waffen kaufen. Was nicht gut Ist aber zu verstehen.Deswegen überfallen sie Tanker bzw Fachtschiffe die wie einen Skyliene wirken im Golf von Somalia so viele sind es.<br>  Auch diese zerst?ren die Umwelt Somalias ohne das Entsch?digungen bezahlt werden oder die Wirtschaft einen Gewinn erh?lt.<br>  Gegen die bewaffneten Fischer k?mpft die Bundeswehr.

Das was du als Vorratsdatenspeicherung bezeichnest, wird nicht erst seit kurzem so gemacht, es ist nur noch nicht all zu lange in den Medien. Schon in vielen Bereichen wird seit lagem das Sammeln von Daten durchgeführt, es hat sich nur noch niemand dagegen gewehrt (z.B. jede Beh?rde speichert seit ewigen Zeiten auch Daten, die nur indirekt mit einem bestimmten Vorgang zu tun haben)<br>  Warum deshalb niemand mehr meckert? Das ist einfach: Dem normalen Menschen wird ja von den (bunten) Medien eingeredet, dass es nur Vorteile bringt. Es ist ja auch toll, wenn man Straft?ter schneller fassen kann, oder wenn der Staat sündigen Mautpreller schnell auf die Spur kommt, wenn Sozialbetrüger schnell ermittelt werden k?nnen. Aber niemand redet davon, welche Nachteile dem (un)mündigen Bürger dadurch entstehen k?nnen. <br>  Beispiel Gesundheitskarte: Nicht jeden Arzt geht meine komplette Krankengeschichte etwas an<br>  Beispiel Vorratsdaten bei den Providern: Es geht niemanden etwas an, welches Surfverhalten ich an den Tag lege, und wer garantiert mir, dass mit meinen Daten kein pers?nlichkeitsprovil erstellt wird? Immerhin sind die Daten ja abgelegt, und warum soll man die dann ungenutzt rumliegen lassen.<br>  Beispiel Mautdaten: Damit lassen sich Bewegungprofile jedes einzelnen Autobahnbenutzers erstellen, und wer sagt uns, dass die gesammlten Daten nicht doch irgendwann für genau diesen Zweck genutzt werden?<br>  Das sind nur mal paar kleine und offensichtliche Dinge, aber es gibt ja noch viel viel mehr.<br>  Warum niemand dagegen auf die Strasse geht? hmm, keine Ahnung wie es bei nem "Wessi" ist, aber die "Ossis" sind mit Sicherheit Demo-müde und sie wissen, dass sie niemals das erreichen, wofür sie auf die Strasse gehen.<br>  Denn von dem, wofür sie mal demonstriert haben, ist nicht viel Wirklichkeit geworden.<br>  Und in Sachen Freiheit und überwachung, bin ich der Meinung, dass es damit im Westen ?hnlich schli9mm ist, wie im Osten.<br>  Aber das ist eben die Siegermentalit?t.

Worin liegt der Vorteil der Regierenden? Bessere Kontrolle! Aber nicht aus Sorge um den Bürger sondern bessere Kontrolle des Bürgers. Nur als weiteres Beispiel, Du hast ja schon genügend Beispiele aufgeführt, vor zwei Jahren wurde das Bankgeheimnis abgeschafft. Seit dem wurden im ersten Jahr, also 2005 3 mio Konten durchleuchtet und in 2006 noch mal weitere 7 mio Konten. Abgeschafft wurde das Bankgeheimnis um weltweiten Terrornetzwerken die Finanzierung abzudrehen. Bei der Gelegenheit wurde auch der Berufsschutz von Anw?lten und Steuerberatern eingeschr?nkt. Konsequenz aus diesem Gesetz ist aber, wenn man sich die nackten Zahlen ansieht, dass man den Bürger besser ausquetschen m?chte. Denn im Gegenzug zu den 7 mio Konten spricht der BND von ca. 30.000 gewaltbereiten, achtung lediglich gewaltbereit, das hei?t noch nicht Terrorist, Moslems und ca. 10.000 gewaltbereiten Rechtsradikalen. Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass diese 40.000 Sicherheitsgef?hrdenden Personen je 175 Konten unterhalten! Warum man hier nur glaubt durch eine Demo gegen den Abbau von Bürgerrechten vorgehen zu k?nnen erscheint mir ein wenig komisch. Ich geh mindestens alle 4 Jahre zur Wahl und entscheide mich für eine Politik, die ich gern m?chte. Das mach ich sowieso nur leider mu? ich mich seit 1989 einer wachsenden Mehrheit unterordnen, die jedesmal mit sch?ner Regelm??igkeit die Parteien in die Regierung w?hlt, die sich geradezu versuchen zu überbieten mit weiteren Einschr?nkungen meiner Bürgerrechte.|`|a55243f5aec726f6b5ca6d5f2995ed9eaa	Hallo, weil den Menschen über die Medien totale Angst eingeredet wird.

So kamen Ermittler nach den Attentaten von London einem Verd?chtigen durch die Anrufe auf seinem Handy auf die Spur. Um auch nachtr?glich herausfinden zu k?nnen, wer wann mit wem telefoniert oder sich wie oft ins Internet eingew?hlt hat, verlangen Innenpolitiker die Speicherung der Verbindungsdaten, so dass Polizei und Staatsanwaltschaft darauf zugreifen k?nnen. Schon kurz nach dem 11. September hatte sich der Rat der EU-Staats- und Regierungschefs für den Ausbau der Datenspeicherung ausgesprochen. Auch die EU-Kommission forderte eine entsprechende Regelung.<br>  <br>  Ich empfinde es für eine Frechheit das wir gl?sern bzw.durchsichtig gemacht werden.Wo bleibt da die Achtung vor der eigenen Pers?nlichkeit auch lt den Gesetzen der Bundesrepublik.<br>  Die 450 Millionen EU-Bürger dürften nicht durch eine generelle Speicherung ihrer Verbindungsdaten unter Pauschal verdacht als Terroristen oder Kriminelle gestellt werden.

Incorporating that idea, in the battle field, take dead pigs and put over doors of places so the taliban will always be in the open a they wouldn't wanna touch piggy boy to get into a vantage point ... or put some sort of explosive into it so if it does get touched.. bang :-P|`|T2zD3FS6aa	That plan sounds about as brilliant as the Arabs attacking Israel on Yom Kippur because the Jews wouldn't fight on such a high holy day.

I immigrated to Canada. You can go to the official governement immigration site. See immigrating, If the adults have enough points based on a test they have you can immigrate on your own, otherwise you need a job or a family member to sponsor you. You have to have immigration phsyicals here, unless you had a spouse already there, <br>  <br>  The exams are around 300 here, each, you need to submit an fbi and local state criminal background check, pay the fees and sit and wait. <br>  <br>  <br>  www.cic.gc.ca <br>  <br>  Food is more expensive there, so is rent, and medical is not all free. You still must pay for dental eye exams and rx. IF you are not legal you cannot attend school like you can in the us.<br>  <br>  GO to www.canada.gc.ca the govt of Canada site and learn more.

261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	This is not about helping the banks. This is about spending so much money, no one will be able to cut taxes. This is about reparations. This is an excuse to raise taxes. This is an excuse to cause poverty and misery so more people will demand taxes on the rich. The more poor people the democrats can make, the more power they have. The party of the poor, needs to produce more poor people. The more poor people they create, the more power they will have. Banks are a personification of "the rich" Liberals are inciting envy of the rich with every single sentence of every speech they make. If you add poverty and envy, you get taxes on the rich. <br>  <br>  The economy started to turn sour long before anyone realized it. It happened under Carter when the Democrats instituted a regulation called "The Community reinvestment Act" It forced banks to make loans to people who could never afford the loans. This created a force to increase the price of homes by increasing the supply of home buyers. Homes became an investment tool since there was a built in demand for homes. Housing prices spun out of control. During 2 of his "State of the Union Addresses" Bush mentioned the fact that there was a crisis looming in the housing market. Nancy Pelosi and Harry reed stood on the floor of congress and denied it. Pelosi even went so far as to claim Fannie and Freddie were being wonderfully run! Of course, no legitimate businessman would have conducted the nefarious business of the democrats at Fannie and Freddie, so they installed left wing political hacks who cooked the books to make it look like nothing was wrong. Lo and behold, just before an election, they let the ketsup hit the fan. Then they blamed it on Bush. when the housing market collapsed. My proof? The directors of Fannie and Freddie, never went to jail even after committing, what looks like, the most massive fraud in the history of the world. <br>  <br>  I'm just going to throw out a wild thought. China with all the US dollars they are holding, will be buying up vast tracks of US land. I'll wager, some of that land just might be oil and mineral rich. What do you want to bet, China will give Obama an ultimatum. "Let us drill, or we will flood your country with your own money and make your currency worthless"|`|AA11702773	Why should we nationalize banks when the government can't name a single 'business' it runs that turns a profit, and itself brags when it lessens a temporary increase of deficit?<br>  <br>  Why go to the WORST performer in choosing management for the banking system?|`|fbeba5dc300a1f4a43941be04a82654aaa	Of course not, although we already own ctibank a the money put in to date would buy all the stock.  Just want we need Barney frank and "banking queen" (sorry ABBA) to run this bank to, he did a hell of a job with fredddie mac.   I can agree with increaasing the capital base of some of banks and getting a preferred stock back.  Although waht would be the real anwer, bu these butt heads will never consider.

Basically you are doing a bench press with  130lbs. Mot serious weight lifters do that as a warm up. Now it admirable  that you can do that. But its not that impressive. However just doing a push up isnt a true test of  your strength either. Its more than that. How fast can you run 2 miles? How many pullups?  You need to include more things and activities for a more accurate assessment|`|Qy174ujuaa	because the military requires and trains you to do pushups with people on your back, they are thinking of making it an olympic sport.... go to the health and fitness section.

U2bJVUfzaa	I believe that this plan will absolutely not work.  $13/paycheck will help some people who struggle to pay their gas bills, or buy an extra few loaves of bread.  It could be saved, of course, but it is very little to help anything significantly.<br>  <br>  I agree that the Fed Govnmt should NOT bailout anyone.  all of this money we are pumping into GM and AIG and so forth is all lost money.  We are borrowing it by selling treasuries to foreign countries, like China & Japan, which CAN be ok.  The problem is that if China and and the likes start calling on these treasures, we are going to have a run on the dollar that will cause inflation in America like has never been seen, and at that point, we will instantly be worse off than we ever were in the Great Depression.  <br>  <br>  If the Government were to reduce income taxes by the $1.3 Trillion, we could all have our income taxes HALVED for the entire calendar year 2009.  It would not only stimulate the economy, but it would protect us from inflation, and it would allow every tax paying American to contribute to our economy.  Can you image keeping half of the money you pay in income taxes in a year?  We would be spending it, and companies would have orders, they could manufacture, their profits would go up, investors would invest in profitable businesses, the market index would go up, balance sheets would be favorable, banks would loan to low risk (based on balance sheets) borrowers.  All would be well.  <br>  <br>  Of course, i believe that these BAILOUT bills aren't intended to bail us out, out right.  They are more of a way to get the pet projects and earmarks passed into law under the guise of "economic stimulus".  They do not stimulate, and none of these measures would pass as a bill under it's own merit.  Only through a rushed, hushed, and irresponsible scare tactic did it every even pass.|`|m5J36D28aa	Only time will tell.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	think of it as a savings plan<br>  <br>  instead of running off to the gas station or McDonald's<br>  <br>  put the money aside for a rainy day<br>  <br>  I know most Americans abhor saving money but when the Depression<br>  hits you will at least eat~also store up on can good and food you can<br>  store for a long time and have a six week to two month supply of<br>  food~the  Depression is coming~Prepare for the worst and hope for<br>  the best|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Well let put it this way<br>  .<br>  When the gas price is up by 3 cents in just a couple of hours <br>  .<br>  How many of us bit_ _ about it<br>  .<br>  Or if there is a quarter lying in the Walmarts parking lot who among us will pass by with out picking it up<br>  .<br>  Get my idea <br>  .<br>  better in my pocket than there's or left on in the parking lot<br>  .|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Honestly I don't know.

I'm so not worried about making the government more like "communist" countries like England or France or Canada.  <br>  <br>  I'm also willing to start using 2 dollar coins, having a second lunch break, and eating more cheese if that will help too, but I haven't gotten the report on that plan as of yet.|`|c6f91ae0c145dcd89ff8090736731713aa	I agree and disagree with you.<br>  $13/week won't do squat for the economy.<br>  And while I disagree with bailing out the automakers (this is the 2nd time for Chrysler; Jimmy Carter did it in the mid-70's), they do employee a huge number of Americans... having them out of work too, I believe is far more harmful to the economy than bailing their employers is. Having said that however, the gov't needs to place strong restrictions on the bailout money. The big 3 cannot continue to place greed (pursuit of a quick buck) over long term strength and stability of the company... example: GM made the Hummer series, which made them a ton of money in a short period of time, but with $4/gallon gas prices, demand quickly disappeared. Now GM is stuck with a costly re-tooling of those manufacturing plants so they can build cars Americans need, rather than cars Americans want (although they never complained when they tooled up to build the Hummers). I'm all for letting the free market & supply and demand run it's course, letting only the strong companies survive, but we have to get the Big 3 up and running again first, to see which ones survive. <br>  Just my thoughts.

E o contingente dos que decidiram trilhar esses caminhos foi crescendo continuamente com o passar dos séculos.

Now he is in fact a liar and a cheat that deserves to be smashed on election day.|`|A8ygY9Saaa	So before you call one man a liar better look at your own candidate a little closer.<br>  <br>  Senator Obama: His promise will not tax 95% of Americans. <br>  <br>  Well take a look at what is waiting for all Americans when and if he is elected President.  <br>  <br>  No taxes right, has he mentioned to his prospective voters a Bill he has pending in the Senate? I think not.<br>  This is a Bill he introduced and that Biden tried to fast track to get passed before the election.<br>  <br>  Obama’s Global Tax Proposal Up for Senate Vote. <br>  <br>  This is prior to his being named Obama’s V.P. choice:<br>  <br>  Senator Joe Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has not endorsed either Senator Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. But on Thursday, February 14, he is trying to rush Obama's "Global Poverty Act" (S.2433) through his committee. The legislation would commit the U.S. to spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on foreign aid, which amounts to a phenomenal 13-year total of $845 billion over and above what the U.S. already spends. Obama calls us "selfish" that takes a a lot of nerve.<br>  <br>  Everyone has said 20 years, in Rev. Wrights Church had no influence on Obama, guess again.<br>  <br>  He wants to take even more American Dollars and send the money to Africa. Rev. Wrights' church taught Africa First, well Obama is going to do just that when or if he is elected.<br>  <br>  The majority of Third World Countries are located in Africa.<br>  <br>  If any of you believe for one moment that he is going to take from what he defines as rich and give to the "Poverty stricken" here in America, better guess again.  Start dialing you Senators and tell them to vote NO on this Bill. The Pelosi Led Democratic House has already passed this Bill.<br>  <br>  The Millennium Declaration also affirms the U.N. as "the indispensable common house of the entire human family, through which we will seek to realize our universal aspirations for peace, cooperation and development."  <br>  <br>  <br>  Is this what We as American really want?

lvyEnAtAaa	Why would we become a socialist state?  We just elected a capitalist just like we always do.<br>  <br>  Socialism and collective action are two entirely different things.  It is really too bad that conservatives are too narrow to understand that, but it is obvious to everybody else.<br>  <br>  Every nation has an armed forces, most have post offices and school systems, and every other developed democracy has some form of public health system.  These are functions that the citizens have decided to take collective action about.  Does mailing a letter make an American into a red?<br>  <br>  There are a few nations that are frankly socialist, but still democracies.  This would include Sweden, where shoes are made in every size.  I think that dismisses your argument right there.<br>  <br>  Relax about Obama.  He is just another American capitalist, and his decisions will be made from that perspective.  Even if he wasn't he would not get far with an unwanted revolution.

We all learned that he got us out of the depression  and other myths. You never learn of the horrible effects of his big government policies that still haunt us to this day.

My parents (both from different town in Missouri) met in Washington DC while employed in FDR make-work type programs.  They raised us while they both worked for government agencies.  Neither ever voted for a Republican.  We, theit five children, were raised in suburbia and educated in college and became more Republican as the Democratic party moved away from their base.<br>  
DLsdhfuuaa	No, we're a few levels behind you.  The liberals have just begun to demonize Republicans -- like they did to the BNP.  The strategy is getting stronger.  I've been called a racist for over a year for supporting McCain.  Once they succeed in making Republican synonymous with Nazi, then the same things will happen to our country with immigration, asylum as happened in Europe.  We're just now starting the process of being led by people who hate our country and Americans and preaching the fears of patriotism.<br>  <br>  And then you'll start seeing the same progression back to the right as is happening in Europe.  It's a hard battle after the liberal indoctrination has set in.|`|yjDM4Mzfaa	Yes, it's called the Republican party!  You know the current administration, Bush/Cheney, the reason we're in this terrible mess of the last 8 years!  Nobody has been further to the right than Bush in quite sometime, yet not even he was able to get Roe vs. Wade overturned, nor did he make any substantial progress on curtailing illegal immigration (or quite frankly anything else for that matter)!  The Republican party candidates, McCain/Palin, also lost the last election probably because they were too far to the right in their ideologies!  America needs to be more inclusive and less divisive/exclusionary!  Maybe you should move elsewhere, but they probably wouldn't let you become a citizen because of their own divisive/exclusionary policies!

The hat known as a 'Cavalier' hat today was the standard men's hat of the time, worn by both cavaliers and puritans. This was a wide brimmed hat with a moderately conical crown. The difference was in the decoration and styling, the puritans, as one would expect, considered anything more than a simple buckle and band around the crown as being excessive while the cavaliers couldn't put enough jewelled and feathered decoration on theirs, as well as applying a jaunty upward curl to one side of the brim.|`|B7abZOTJaa	I'm with Pete on this good concise answer.|`|30R7gIXtaa	lobster pot helmet

Yeah, right, What a shame to help a little some of the most impoverished areas of the country, where at times families earn 5000 bucks a year (yes, you read it right).

It is no coincidence that one of the countries with the highest tax rates in the world, Denmark, is also considered the happiest country on Earth and also has very low unemployment.<br>  <br>  Besides, lowering taxes usually does not increase revenue, at least not enough to make up for the lowered taxes. You would have to be on the right spot on the Laffer curve for that to happen, and our taxes are nowhere near high enough that lowering them would increase our revenue.

(Specific Event)<br>  3.  Omnibus -- CBO says fail -- it's just spending they couldn't cram through Congress last year and the year before.  (Specific Event)<br>  4.  Cap and Trade will hurt business as they'll have to purchase their particulate matter credits on the free-market...b/c there's a limited supply, the price of them just skyrocketed.  They'll have to compensate by scaling back or shuffling the increased cost to you -- both outcomes result in hurting the middle/lower classes the most.  After all, the rich business man will still be rich.  (Specific Event)<br>  5.  Removing Farm Subsidies pushes American farmers out of the global market.  Although other countries don't get direct farm payments like Americans, in China for instance, the land is owned by the government, the seed is paid for by the government, the crop is planted by the government, the crop is maintained by the government and the crop is harvested and sold by the government.  Anyone w/ any brain power would realize those are government subsidies that allow the Chinese to undercut American prices on the market.  The farms will scale back -- workers will be unemployed...that's assuming the farms stay afloat at all.  Food prices will also go up w/ the reduced supply on the market.  (Specific Event)<br>  6.

Things that Obama is either facing or created are waaaay more difficult, such as the 10.7 TRILLION dollars in debt he is placing on MY generation to pay back, when WE DON'T NEED IT.  Sure, we are in a recession and very likely will be in a depression soon, but what the hell is throwing out MORE money going to do? Appease people for a month? Obama's the first black president.

67ea71af780ce95553f2ddb1eddee690aa	I think the government and all of the citizens of this country need to mind their own business and/or stop being hypocrites at the same time. Natural drugs should be made legal...period. No one can argue about how many lives it destroys when alcohol (which is totally legal) has a body bag count that can't even be compared to that of marijuana or other natural substances. If opium was legal, so many people would have a better quality of life that suffer now because of gov't regulations on pain medicines.<br>  <br>  Those who excessively abused the drugs would quickly weed  (I said weed...haha!) themselves out of the gene pool not to mention gang violence would go down, taxes could be imposed on the regulated and the money could go into the state education system, and many other benefits to at least the decriminalization of certain drugs (things exclusively grown naturally...not things like LSD or PCP because those are processed chemicals. But yes, drugs should be legalized. People who bash people who use drugs are seriously misinformed and it's clearly obvious that they can't think for themselves. All the while some people who bash pot smokers will go out and get hammered up drunk trying to drive to the store to get more booze and killing innocents along the way with two tons of screaming death a.k.a. a car or truck coming at them. Alcohol also contributes to domestic violence rates being as high (I said high...haha!) as they are. If someone smokes weed they're not going to attack or hurt anyone.

I think Obama will stay in the White House where he has his teleprompter close at hand.<br>  <br>  You need to realize that there is a reason that Rush is so popular and successful. You need to try and figure out why the left has never been successful in this medium where people can turn you off. But for some reason, folks like you never try to do that. You simply hug your 'belief system' and hum to yourself. Well, keep humming, dude. You're everything we've come to expect from a follower of Obama.|`|wz9szz3Gaa	Ask your leader Obama. Rush asked him to come and debate and bring no teleprompter or index cards and he would . Obama has no chance with him!|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Presidents do NOT debate talk show hosts<br>  <br>  if Rush were serious about politics he would RUN<br>  instead of just RUNNING his mouth|`|SFnxkS3Raa	because Obama is the President of the United States, Rush is a bombastic entertainer.|`|wwzoqIvVaa	Why would Obama waste his time?  Rush Limbaugh is not worth my time, why would it be worth his?|`|MM8rqTMtaa	You've got Obama responding to an AM disk jockey.  Even Clinton with his complete lack of self control never did that.

US taxpayers are tired of spending over $300 billion a year to support them and their anchor babies. We are tired of our gov, illegally, giving birthright citizenship to aliens. In 1950s these children were deported along with their parents.<br>  WE are tired of the inferior education our children are getting, while being forced to pay millions of dollars every year to teach their children english.<br>  We are tired of the "extra" crime illegals commit in the US. (rape, murder, robbery, ID theft, fraud, kidnapping)<br>  We are fed up with the bilingual crap. No other nationality is extended this privilege. <br>  We are sick of our property values going down because of the crime and damage they bring into the neighborhoods they inhabit.<br>  It has nothing to do with hate or (race) nationality.  It's all about the crime, welfare abuse, poverty, birth rates, education and tax dollars spent (wasted). The drop out rate is almost 50%.<br>  <br>  EDIT: it's wonderful how all of you forget anchor babies. With over 5 million in the US at this time that is a lot of illegal families qualifying for welfare. DES does not ask a persons immigration status when they apply. Nor do they verify Soc Sec #s.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	I can't think of one reason that someone would fear mexicans other then they do commit a lot of crime. Most of them start by coming over here illegally and continue from there. The illegals are making it worse for legal mexicans, which is pretty sad. U.S. tax payers are fed up and since our government hasn't done anything to stop illegals the citizens feel they need to do it.|`|FpioJ7F5aa	Because over 98% of the illegal aliens in the United States... most of whom are collecting some form of welfare to compensate for the low wages... are Mexican Nationals.  Because the illegal aliens have discovered many, many way to hide in our 'open' society, what the numbers are cannot be determined by a government that shucks and jives, but as nearly as we can tell, the welfare is running at something over 485 BILLION a year.  <br>  <br>  Any fool who thinks that is acceptable is dumber than a rock.  MOST of Washington is dumber than a rock, and Americans are very angry about it.  We ARE gonna talk about it too.|`|ZXkOQapLaa	It's not for some of us.

They also refuse to acknowledge that "illegal aliens" are different from legal immigrants, lumping both into the ambiguous term "immigrant".  My take:  they're trying to pretend that opposition to illegal immigration is racism, and that it doesn't matter if someone breaks our laws to come here and remain here because everyone's an "immigrant". Yes, there are illegal aliens from other countries, probably every country on earth, with lots from Ireland, Poland, China, India, and so on.  But you don't see them demanding we speak their languages, provide bilingual education or that they're exempt from our laws because of their "culture".  And yes, illegal aliens are human, but that doesn't exempt them from following our laws. All the more reason that they do, in fact, because laws/rules are necessary to the smooth functioning of society (look at Mexico now and see how well not respecting the law works out).  As an Arab-American, I am personally offended by the implication that Hispanics have the right to ignore U.S. laws in coming here illegally and committing other crimes in support of their illegal presence here, while U.S. citizens and legal immigrants obey them.|`|bA4ucVDTaa	GREAT QUESTION! and if you hang around, you'll see the same people on here go off on questions regarding Illegal Mexicans while almost ignoring all others.

Here is the thing - if we had a surplus, or even if the economy was climbing steady on its way to getting rid of our huge deficit, THEN these things could be considered on SEPARATE pieces of legislation - NOT on a Emergency Stimulus bill (call it what you want, I know, I know, it is called a Reinvestment and Reform Act - same thing).<br>  <br>  There is a time and place for everything - THIS is NOT the time for items like these!

Neither of which does anything to make citizens healthier.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Health care isn't tied to jobs.  Anyone who wants can go out and get health coverage.  There are plans already in place to assist those who are disabled, and the elderly/retired as well.  I know people, my mother being one, who are self employed and have health coverage.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Most full-time jobs do.      The reason this is the case is that after WWII, Truman kept wartime wage and price controls in place, and employers, who weren't allowed legally to give their employees raises, started offering "fringe benefits" to retain their best talent (yes you read that correctly - it was illegal to give their employees raises, so employers found a way around the law to increase compensation - not because they were such nice people but so that they could retain talent, because that's how the market works).    <br>  <br>  This worked for insurance companies because the actuarial tables work only with respect to populations - i.e., you need a broad pool of insureds, otherwise the tables don't work.    The odds of my having a heart attack are X%.    Say 3%.   That doesn't mean I'm going to have 3% of a heart attack.    It means out of 100 people similar to me in some respects, it is likely that 3 of us will have cardiac arrest.   That enables the insurer to establish premium rates for the 100 of us that will in turn enable the insurer to pay for the care of the 3 of us.<br>  <br>  It so happens that a large workplace is also a large pool of insureds.    <br>  <br>  There are other potential pools of insureds - but this is why the concept basically works and this is how it came to be that we get our insurance through our jobs.<br>  <br>  Perhaps getting it through our schools would make more sense, IDK.

Furthermore, I believe that every young American should have to spend a mandatory 2 years in either the military or the Peace Corps to truly understand what it's about, and what goes on in other countries. <br>  <br>  Knowledge is power and no one can make a reasonable argument for or against something that they don't understand and know nothing about.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	I say let military personnel drink a beer at 18.<br>  <br>  But don't raise the military age.

A buddy of mine is a Lt. Col in the rangers and he did recruiting in this area until just recently.  He would not talk to the kid unless his parents were on board.  <br>  <br>  The drinking age used to be 18.  However the liberals changed everything because of the DUI laws.  So who is to blame for that?  When Ohio changed to 21, they did it in steps.  I was 18 and legal to purchase beer.  However they changed it to 19 and I missed the grandfather by 1 month.  <br>  <br>  If you change the military, you also need to change the age of consent for everything to 21.  This means apartment leases, car purchases, opening bank accounts, etc.  <br>  <br>  Do you really want that?|`|WjkVSWZRaa	>Why can you fight for your country at 18 but can't drink a beer until you are 21?<br>  <br>  Because an ignorant democrat congress threatened to cut off federal highway funding unless states changed their drinking age to 21.|`|P8JWNjyHaa	NO. You think an 18 year old dont have a clue about there signing up for when they enlist? I think youve forgotten what its like to be 18. They have a CLUE, if not the actual idea. There not as naive as you believe them to be. <br>  <br>  Its their choice, and let it be their choice. Its a way to pay off college and serve their country. I would say most, if not all, are proud to serve their country. It also gives them an amazing look at the outside world and a lifetime of experience.<br>  <br>  However, there are MANY downsides. But I believe the military age should be at 18.
03rOCajTaa	I see where you are coming from. Personally I don't feel right telling them they can only have so many children. Then again I don't think we should be giving food stamps to support  a couple of children their hole life...hmmm well I wouldn't want the children to starve either. <br>  This is a tough one<br>  Maybe food stamps for a certain amount of time.

People who stay on welfare and don't do anything to better their situation annoy me.  That said, I know several people on government assistance who have kids. One of them is 18 and going to college. She has a part time job and uses student loans to pay for tuition. She's also on WIC to get formula for her baby and is on government health care. She doesn't make enough to pay for insurance for her and a baby. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't even come close to suggesting she should be sterilized. She's taking responsibility for her life without any help from her parents. Finishing college will keep her off of government support for the rest of her life. You're just a bit harsh, I think.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	I don't think you can make a universal statement about that. I think there is no doubt some people take Advantage of the system but there are also some very fine parents who do a great job of raising their kids.<br>  I guess bottom line is I would be in favor of no more kids while on welfare but not mandatory surgical sterilization.In other birth control but not sterilization (to much like Nazi Germany).

I defy them to live on what I have, in a 936 square foot house, in the poorest county in my state. Sometimes can't afford the down-payment on a free lunch! At any rate, I'm pretty sure I said, way back in October, that if Mr. Obama was elected, he'd be changing his tune about what HE was gonna do if elected. I think he got a whiff of the winds of change, and the smell left him looking for the barf bags. It always looks different from the other side of the fence. Careful what you wish for, Mr. President...now whatchya gonna do? Time to do some major backpedaling. There's no way he can deliever on a lot of his promises, especially on keeping taxes at the rates he was talking about. We're all gonna pay, and pay dearly. And every meeting that he comes out of will show him that this is definitely a bigger hunk of meat than he thought it was. Mom always told us to eat everything that you put on your plate, so choose wisely & don't be wasteful. Me thinks that someone wasn't listening to his mama too well. That's an awful big plate there, Mr. President...and guess what? You're required to eat even more! I would think that the stock in barf bags should be going through the roof pretty soon, as many of these fellas will be using them after each meeting.

avVdKiWKaa	It is scary, the fact that police wield lethal force.  You look at some of these guys, this huge sidearm bouncing on their donut thighs, and realize that SOME of them are even more nuts than you or me.  It is very, very scary indeed.  What do I think of thug tactics with so little accountability?  Well, I could rant about it, I guess, but that would be obvious.  What I do know is that your average beat cop sees a lot of crap we are fortunate enough not to have to confront on practically a daily basis.  Many of them develop a real revulsion towards human nature in general.  Man beating his wife half to death because dinner's late, juveniles drunk and stealing a car and running over some kid in the process, and on and on and on.  It's awful what these "brave policemen" did, exercising their option to commit murder because they could get away with it.  Their transference of making this hapless Polish immigrant stand and pay for all the assholes they come in contact with on a dazzling regular basis is inexcusable, but on some level understandable.  Perhaps the inquiry will yield convictions.  It wouldn't be totally inconceivable, although unfortunately highly unlikely.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	I remember that video, and the force used looks excessive. Putting your knee on somebody's windpipe is a bad idea, unless you're fighting him by yourself and there's no other way to control him. But I don't care much for your hyperbole. A uniformed cop doesn't need to speak your language for you to know that you need to stop and calm down, and any object you pick up and threaten him with can be deemed a weapon (I had a desk stapler thrown at me once, and yes those things can be heavy and they do hurt).|`|zLUQJxJkaa	I think:<br>   you should give me a link, I don't know the full details of the case, you are intentionally not providing full details (or at least more and better ones), and that NOBODY gets tased just for not speaking English so something else must have happened- hence details that you didn't provide me with.<br>  ..

You are not telling all the story.|`|nwMBfgcdaa	First, you are not giving the whole story.<br>  Secondly, at the time, the use of a Taser was lowest on the Use of Force Continuum used by RCMP.  These men were trained that a Taser is a safe, useful option without getting into a physical confrontation.  Their training told them it was a non-lethal use of force option.  Although it was mentioned that there have been deaths "related" to Tasers, none have actually been to blame.  Most of these guys have probably been tasered themselves during training. <br>  <br>  At the time of the incident, their policies support the use of a Taser in that situation.  <br>  <br>  The RCMP has now accepted the fact that a Taser can be a lethal weapon and has moved its use to just below deadly force.  <br>  <br>  While I don't agree with Tasering the man 5 times and failing to render assistance to him, I think you should give the whole story.|`|qwaWd14vaa	It is quite obvious that you would make a good news reporter, reporting on sensationalism, rather then the facts in the matter.<br>  The story you cite is not as your cite says. The stapler was a weapon. The Polish Immigrant, did not speak english, but later it was found, had severe mental problems, was not in compliance to orders being given by the police to put the weapon down. It is quite obvious, you have never been hit by a stapler or had a stapler when making contact with your skin release a staple into it?<br>  I suggest you watch the video again and again. Ask yourself what would I have done? The man never complied with the police orders, so what are you gonna do, let him go about the airport ranting and raving and possibly hurting an unarmed civilian, maybe even you?|`|6cTj2iOAaa	Absolutely an open stapler is a weapon, as much as a nunchuk is.  But then so is a clenched fist, which he also had, and, according to published reports, was approaching the constables in a menacing manner.<br>  <br>  Witness video at news site bears that out also.<br>  <br>  Tazers are less lethal then shooting, or clubbing combative people to submission, but not perfect.<br>  <br>  My suggestion?

Sad, but not the cops fault.|`|Fy54FMemaa	Anything you pick up to use as a weapon is deemed as dangerous.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Anything can be used as a weapon.I think you may be leaving  part of the story out.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	I agree with the first guy. Im sure the older man was doing something alittle more then just getting a little upset. for the police to want to detain him he would have to be getting very irate and threatening people. Tazers usually dont kill people so this guy obviously had some health issues. If he did have a stapler in his hand then what was its purpose? was he trying to use it as a weapon? cause that alone would be grounds for the police to tazer him.<br>  <br>  Edit: I just watched the video, he was doing alot more then just not speaking english he picked up a table and was acting like he was gunna throw it. im supprised they didnt do more then tazer him.

O5KOwhovaa	Wise words, unfortunately the Americans who yell "Communist!!!" at everything they don't like simply do not possess the intellect to read your excellent definitions and comprehend your argument|`|P8JWNjyHaa	Socialism is the creation of certain violation of human rights : sweatshops, does not creat fair trade overseas, enables exploitation of natural resources.<br>  <br>  Communism also doesnt work.|`|ESWdyM6Haa	I never cease to be amazed at the ignorant drivel I read on here. Dude, you are illiterate! Not in the sense that you can't read but rather, apparently, you don't read! Now, rather than reading books 'about' these various economic and/or political systems you need to study their source documents then, at least, you'll be able to use their proper nouns correctly in sentences.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	point by point:<br>  <br>  1.  government provided free services will always be overused and thus taxes will have to rise to the point of stifling economic opportunity.  Ask the Swedes about this.<br>  <br>  2.  prevent bad consequences always leads to more and more bad decisions.  if there is no need to save for possible bad outcomes, where will the capital required for economic growth come from?<br>  <br>  3.  where is it written that unions will contribute to effective economic growth?  non-union Wal-Mart is the largest force for low prices in America.  regulation of business and markets should be limited to those cases where an imbalace of bargaining power exists naturally between the participants.<br>  <br>  4.  neither alternative energy sources nor global warming is based on sound engineering and science.  thus, all government programs in these areas will inherent steal resources from real economic growth and thus real economic opportunity.<br>  <br>  5.  there is no evidence that either VAT or progressive taxation promotes real economic opportunity as opposed to uncontrolled growth of government and its inherent inefficiencies.<br>  <br>  6.  progressive social policy is not a measurable outcome and thus will be manipulated by demagogic politicians for their own glorification and seizure of power over others.<br>  <br>  7.  immigration -- is this a code word for unrestricted movement of people to where ever they please?  This works fine as long as they expect nothing from the government of the place the move to -- which isn't what you propose to provide.  Otherwise, people move to the place where they get the most for free -- which means at the expense of everyone else.  <br>  <br>  multiculturalism is an unproven theory and, from the perspective of evolution may be a dead end.  certainly, some cultures provide more opportunities and more freedoms than others do.  evolution as applied to cultures suggests that some will die out and for evolutionary good reasons.  why would you want to preserve losing cultures by adding burdens to the winning ones?<br>  <br>  8.  "Fair" is a value laden concept which can not be defined.  "free", however, is reasonably definable -- it means without hindrance or barriers.  Thus, "fair trade" will always be manipulated by pressure groups and politicians for their own benefit and thus will always be used to oppress some minority group.<br>  <br>  9.  "social justice" is also inherently undefinable and thus will always be abused.  the other concepts here amount to "freedom", which can be achieved only if you are willing to confront evil and possibly die for doing so.<br>  <br>  10.  artificially raising the standard of living of any group implies taxing other groups and flies in the face of the concepts underlying evolution.  sorry, but you do not get to vote on whether evolution is a real force in Universe -- you either recognize that it is or get run over by it.  such artificial alterations of economic outcomes will always result in reductions or failures of economic growth and thus tend to create the very thing you oppose -- entrenched elites wielding power to stay entrenched.<br>  <br>  11.  global poverty and inequality are not the outcomes of free markets, they are the outcomes of cultures that fail to adapt to the imperatives of learning what works and what does not.  free markets are the prime driver in lifting people out of poverty and thus creating equality.<br>  <br>  12.  no where it is written in stone that economic stability is required for efficient growth or learning to occur.  they may, in fact, require periodic cleansing of outmoded ideas and failed firms.  stability isn't necessary, but rather something humans want because it makes their lives easier ... ease isn't an objective function of Universe.  In a similar vein, extreme poverty is a judgment, not evidence that the system isn't working.  surely, extreme poverty is a prime motivator in getting people off their attitudes and initiating change.<br>  <br>  13.  that other run up deficits does not make more deficits the answer.  government "accounting" is and always has been a bad joke by the standards we hold corporations to.<br>  <br>  14.  restricting rights always leads to sub-par economic performance.  There is no economic magic inherent in the voting booth -- collective decision making is always far less efficient than millions of individuals deciding based on immediate signals what the best course of action for them is.|`|TItRpckpaa	The problem is it sounds good on paper but where it has been tried it doesn not work. It's part of the human condition. <br>  <br>  We fled Europe and came here to start a free country, where each state governs and enforces its own laws while still operating under the umbrella of the federal law, however federal government was made small so that each state has its own laws and people move to variouse states according to how they wanted to live.  <br>  <br>  If certain states want to have social programs thats fine but what if I want to bear arms and live ina  free market to reap the many benefits of capitalism? Without having to worry about the government taking my money and distributing it around as they see fit? Calling it "fair"|`|e36bcd7f45f132e8833b6f65649c3f42aa	No, I believe in the American design of a republic, not a democracy.<br>  <br>  You can bray all you want about wealth redistribution raising living standards, but the fact of the matter is that this country achieved it's greatest advances and successes when we had more freedom, and no personal taxes. No death taxes, no estate taxes, no real estate taxes, no capital gains taxes....nada. Only tariffs to pay for our needs.<br>  <br>  The gap between rich and poor was smaller too, because currency was commodity based. <br>  <br>  You can't even name a single inregulated market.  The banks and the securities industries are the most regulated in the world. Stop pretending that the free market is the problem.<br>  <br>  We can't have a free market as long as we have a central bank.<br>  <br>  Socialized health care's failures are evident right here in America.  The people used to be able to pay cash at the doctor's office, and only carried affordable major medical / hospitalization policies.  Then the government "helped" by introducing Medicare, Medicaid, and HMO plans....which meant they started picking up the tab for 50% of our health care costs, and as a result those costs went through the roof,  and also enabling the for-profit models to drive the charity / church run operations out of business. <br>  <br>  Right now, health care is rationed by who can afford it.  Obama's plan will ration it by taking it away from the very people who need it - the sick and the elderly.  It's a form of genocide, and it is quite disturbing to see how many people think that it's a fine plan.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	Let's pick on social security for a moment.  It's an interesting one because liberals and "social democrats" claim to be progressive, but social security represents one of the largest transfers of wealth from the poor and middle class to the wealthy today.  Who do you think controls the most wealth in our society?  That's right: people over 50.  What percentage of rich retirees collect social security checks?  100%<br>  <br>  One quick fix to social security is to make it need based.  Quit calling it a retirement plan and start calling it a tax to help the elderly that are in need.|`|yW418gIJaa	This is basically what you have now.  The fear is derived from when it starts leaning farther towards communism because Socialism is just a transition phase.  Socialism is the attempt and like a subtle good for you pill that people swallow that eventually gives them horrendous stomach problems because it metabolized into communism.  You open the potential to power, and once that monster has his head in the door, it gets to difficult to shut it.  <br>  <br>  Which is where we are headed now. People are already flirting with the idea now, saying "let's give it a try".

NEWSFLASH, you are a socialist.<br>  <br>  Socialism, at ANY level, caters to the lowest achievers at the expensive of the best and brightest.  When a society rewards failure and punishes success that society ceases to advance.<br>  <br>  Before you start cheering for socialism, please take note that it's a failure everywhere it's been tried.  Even in the European countries your kind likes to prop up as some example of success.<br>  <br>  And FYI public debt held by both the US and UK is a lower percent of GDP than the debt held by Germany and France.  And the European socialist countries have begun scaling back social programs because they're just not sustainable.<br>  <br>  The worst case scenerios of US unemployement numbers.. have US unemployment in an economic crisis reaching the level the socialist utopias have during their regular economic conditions.<br>  <br>  Finally, the quality of health care service in the US is second to none.  We pay for it, but we get the best.|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	GREAT QUESTION and nicely put thanks, I like discussion  <br>  <br>  <br>  ? A mixed economy consisting of both private enterprise and government-owned or subsidized programs of education, health care, child care and related social services for all citizens.<br>  <br>  I don’t think the Federal Government should own anything, State and local government run programs is a bit different because it is up to the individuals of those states to pick and choose what they want their community to look like, it is like the social model of the free market system. The Federal government has a specific purpose and should not over step it.  <br>  <br>  <br>  ? An extensive system of social security (although not to the extent advocated by socialists), with the stated goal of counteracting the effects of poverty and insuring the citizens against loss of income following illness, unemployment or retirement.<br>  <br>  To an extent, though the idea of Social Security is noble, with the likes of Abortion (killing off working people to pay into the system) and the worry of the entitlement mentality It is a rough one for me, I mean yeah it is a good idea but controlling it doesn’t seem feasible what I would rather see is us as human beings having the mentality of my neighbor is my family and caring for the widows and needy as a community, maybe community farms and programs but again not a federal system. I think the old Jewish/Biblical model is pretty spot on and I think that social security was the idea of governmentalize that train of thought but again when government gets involved (unless at the local level) It becomes so over reaching and controlling that it gets out of control and starts dictating so yeah tough one. But I will say I don’t think it promotes responsibility. <br>  <br>  ? Government bodies that regulate big business enterprise in the interests of workers and consumers by ensuring labor rights (i.e. supporting worker access to trade unions), consumer protections, and fair market competition.<br>  <br>  Ok fair enough that is ok as long as they don’t become like the Labor unions of today and the Lobbyists and such. The government never knows its limits. Government can govern sure but people should control the market, if a company is engaging in poor labor rights don’t buy from them, people need to have their own values and morality and not expect government to dictate to them right and wrong that is something that should come out through us and through God through us. But yeah government is there to protect and serve agreed<br>  <br>  <br>  ? Environmentalism and environmental protection laws; for example, funding for alternative energy resources and laws designed to combat global warming.<br>  <br>  Global warming is a farce – except for the fact that God said we will be burned up and scorched in the end, so yeah it will happen but we are humans and we don’t effect things like that, we are a spec of sand on the beach ya know. It is arrogant to say we have that much power. BUT GOD did call us to be good stewards of the earth so yes we should care for that which is ours and not abuse the earth, she is precious and God has entrusted it to us but ya know God is still God and we aint gonna effect any climate the way the Enviro- wackos think we can. George Carlin said it best.<br>  <br>  ? A value-added/progressive taxation system to fund government expenditures.<br>  If that means no federal taxes (state and local ok agreed) no income tax, no property taxes but a fair tax instead YES agreed <br>  <br>  ? A secular and progressive social policy, although this varies markedly in degree.<br>  <br>  Well you lost me at secular – the First paragraph of the Constitution and Declaration of independence says it all <br>  <br>  <br>  ? Immigration and multiculturalism.<br>  <br>  What about it, we are all immigrants (well except me I am part Native American so I am only part immigrant LOL) and multiculturalism is a joke. We should all be proud of our heritage and promote it and acknowledge with in our families, never forget your history but other wise we are all just Americans, see the oath to become an American Citizen I think that says it all <br>  <br>  ? Fair trade over free trade. – YEAP – Ok although we might not be on the same page but it sounds good what you said and how I envision it in my head <br>  <br>  <br>  ? A foreign policy supporting the promotion of democracy, the protection of human rights and where possible, effective multilateralism.<br>  <br>  Ok sure, as long as that doesn’t mean legitimizing terrorists and those who could care less about humanity, or as long as the doesn’t mean negotiating out of fear <br>  <br>  ? Advocacy of social justice, human rights, social rights, civil rights and civil liberties.<br>  <br>  NO!!!! get out of town, our constitution and Bill or Rights got it covered, legislating from the BENCH IS WRONG WRONG WRONG on every level <br>  <br>  ? Social democratic policies actually enhance individual rights by raising the standard of living of the great majority of the population, increasing social mobility, raising the power of workers and consumers in society.<br>  <br>  Ask Margerate Sanger and the Pro-Slavery party of the Democrats until after the Vietnam war, yeah NOT! What enhances individual rights and standards etc.. is compassion and humanity which is wrapped up in one thing LOVE, AGAPE, GOD promote that and everything else falls into place we are men not children. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ? The unregulated market that fiscal conservatives advocate is incapable of addressing global poverty and inequality in an equitable way.<br>  Nope not at all, unless you think it is wrong to give what you have, give what you don’t have and volunteer every chance you can. Don’t just throw a man a fish all the time (sometimes sure) but teach him how to fish. Teach him how to build and how to irrigate and how to read, education and love man you cant beat that. <br>  <br>  <br>  ? Social democracy stabilizes economic conditions by providing economic security to individuals and eliminating the threat of extreme poverty.<br>  What does that even mean, that is like emotional drivel just something to say that sounds good and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.<br>  There will always be rich and poor, the disabled and the healthy. Until Jesus comes back. All I can do is be my brothers keeper, help those who cannot help themselves and encourage those who just want to be lazy. <br>  <br>  <br>  ? The argument that social democratic governments spend too much and run up deficits is undermined by the record of conservative administrations (e.g. in the United States and the United Kingdom) which have run up unprecedented deficits.<br>  <br>  Well yeah because they are not being “Conservatives” they are cutting taxes and increasing spending and the size of government or they are raising taxes and increasing spending and the size of government. They are borrowing against what they don’t have. There is not fiscal discipline just oh look programs, programs, programs that the federal government has no business being in, in the first place and if they want to be in it then fund the programs but not by taxing the people, figure out something else, run it like a business and then they might get somewhere or a charity ya know. I mean why are congressmen making more than the average American on my taxes, that is not helpful or constitutional<br>  <br>  <br>  ? By restricting some economic rights, social democracy makes the market more fair (for small businesses and consumers, for example).<br>  <br>  Restricting is controlling and controlling is not fair that is why it is called restricting and besides restricting is what a parent does to a child. And government is not my mother or father or God. <br>  <br>  Oversight and regulations have their place but not as a means to control. People need to get back to individual morals, values, principle, family and God and that is what will ensure a more fair market from the crack head on the street to the CEO of Microsoft to the CIA and the President. It is about who you are as a person and what you will accept as right and wrong and if people had personal integrity then no one would get away with crap and at least not for too long. But instead the left keeps telling us morality is relative that everything is circumstantial instead of telling the truth; life is filled with rights and wrongs and lines and we need to live with in those boundaries for the good of self and the greater good of humanity, if it feels good do it is a recipe for disaster, it is like trying to play a baseball game with no rules|`|qKr5wRxyaa	It amazes me how little factual information most Americans have about basic fundamental principles of economic systems.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	lol,your wrong! all unions are is microsocialism.where the few take care of the unproductive.if this isn't true,why is it that union states are are the lowest gdp? look at europe.it is on the verge of total collapse.germany and others want to keep their own money.lol,you libs kill me.|`|wbIEau0qaa	france, canada and most of europe have socialized healthcare, it seems to work fine for them|`|3caq6SFxaa	Socialism will work in a limited scale or degree.  We have had socialism for a long time and it has been limited; the problem/concern is how far do you take it.  I do not think bailing out people who took a chance that they would be able to refinance their home at a lower rate or sell it for a profit before ARMs went up should be helped-they took a chance and lost; if the market had gone up would they have not kept any profit?  I understand the plight of people who lost their jobs and they should be helped, pay cuts probably be helped, but those betting on the housing market and pay raises to make it made a bad investment and it is the way the ball bounces.  As far as your concerns about global this and that-I live on this planet but I am an American first and foremost; too much of the global poverty is caused by the governments of those areas and helping them is a lost cause without major changes in how the leadership of those countries act.  Yes social democracy works but where does the line between social democracy and pure socialism or even communism?   Our deficits are as much caused by the social programs as anything else; the military iis notthe largest spender in the US budget but social programs are.The concern is how far it is being taken and what rights are we expected to give up?  Question yesterday that was widely agreed with is that the right to a good paying job is more important then the right of freedom of speech;  the question did not surprise me as much as the large number of primarily young people who agreed-that is cause for concern for the people of this nation.  Those who would give up liberty for security will soon have and deserve neither.|`|SS1VReF0aa	socialist health care does not work...not the way Americans expect their health care to work.  I'm ok with government running education, law enforcement, the military, road crews and public transportation systems. I am ok with them mostly at the state level (That is the key to this, STATES run the programs), of course the military needs to be federal.<br>  <br>  I am not ok with my health care being managed by the government, I am not ok with my retirement being managed by the government. I am perfectly capable of doing this on my own through private businesses as is every American.<br>  <br>  My reasoning for this is simple...<br>  1. Government is wasteful, corrupt and incompetent. The government has proven time and time again that it is not nearly as efficient or as intelligent as the private sector.<br>  2. When you have the federal government run these programs, I lose control of my life. If the people of California want to try socialist health care they can. They can elect officials in their state to get that program started and do it if they want. Then when it doesn't work they can remove them from office and change to whatever else they want. However, if its at the federal level then California is going to push these crap programs on me and my family. I no longer have control over that because I cannot vote Nancy Pelosi out of office. We don't want it in our state!

3hAPLJ4Iaa	Well, there must be someone who cares what he says, he is the highest paid talk show celebrity in radio history.  It could be that since he hauling in such a big paycheck Limbaugh is in constant need of new material in order to keep his listeners interested, and with that pressure he needs to be constantly in the news, and it is easy to do, an outlandish statement here, a rough commentary there, and the public that tunes him in is sufficiently entertained.  <br>  <br>  People must get past the part that this guy is nothing more than a circus clown who has other interests rather than the public good.  THIS GUY IS AN ENTERTAINER - nothing more.  His opinion means nothing.<br>  <br>  Like most (if not all) political commutators Limbaugh likes to ***** and moan allot but he really has no substance, nor any solutions to any of the problems that he comments on.  Political commentators/talk show hosts can talk a good fight, and they complain about different political, international, public and financial problems but  none of them haven't a clue on how to fix them. <br>  <br>  So like any other blow hard, know-it-all Limbaugh gets the ball rolling as so far as public discussion on various subjects, but besides that the guy is once again a circus clown (and a very rich one at that). <br>  <br>  So if you have a brain in your head, and any common sense, you will see past the shomanship and ask for substance.  Good luck in the search.|`|kMYE3vV8aa	I wonder if you're truly a republican or just playing one on YA...<br>  <br>  In either case, you're entitled to your opinion, but you're just as bad as the others on here that are hurling insults at Rush.  He is also entitled to his opinion and if you don't want to listen to him then don't, but true conservatives find his words true most of the time.

Congratulations.|`|7Z9U4f5paa	Also a big blowhard for the ecentric lefttest.|`|cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	People care about what he says because the word Republican has lost it's meaning in the last decade or so.  He articulates thoughts about conservatism better than most, and incorporates humor into the mix.  The White House wants to elevate him to a status within the party because as popular as he is, he is MORE unpopular.  The republicans are wary of dismissing him, because he speaks to/for some twenty odd million conservatives every week.  All that being said, it is a huge distraction from the problems we really face right now, and should be ignored.|`|jrdtQi04aa	If ;you listen to Rush, sometimes what he says makes some sense.  I really dont have a problem with what he says.  I usually have a problem with the way he says it.  I think he speaks rudely and I believe he promotes a lot of hatred with the WAY he says things.  The one thing that bugs me about him is how he is always yapping about the African American issues, such as drugs and what not, and who was on drugs themself?  He just didnt do any time for it, but he sure wants to put any 16 year old black kid under the jail for the same thing.|`|JqYYspAAaa	About 10% of what he says is true the rest is no better that what Obama says, Stupid BS.<br>  This is a case of the pot calling the kettle black, no pun intended.|`|43zXRpLYaa	My guess is either you don't understand the difference between conservative and liberal and/or never listened to Rush more than a few minutes.|`|y3XaJhhAaa	Kinda hard not to listen to him since hes a radio host.|`|uxu8qJUYaa	I don't listen to him.

I'm done on that issue.<br>  <br>  I listened to him for a bit 18 years ago, and he made a lot of sense on some issues. I don't know what he's been up to since then, but he obviously has the power to galvanize his listeners, and not a lot of media personalities have that ability.<br>  <br>  As for the "drug addict" BS, well, many painkillers DO cause addiction. It is in their chemical makeup. I take antiseizure medication, and am I a drug addict? You bet your ***. What I take has the side effect of addiction, and if I were to quit suddenly it would entail a hellish withdrawal for me (not to mention that I'd be risking a fatal seizure). Everyone here knows SOMEONE who has had a substance problem. Maybe some (like me) have it themselves. It's hardly an example of liberal virtue to call dissenters "drug addicts" but turn a blind eye to liberal addicts. <br>  <br>  Addiction has brought a lot of people (both people we approve of and people we don't) down. I don't see people trashing Robert Downey Jr. On the contrary, I'm thrilled to see him get another chance at a sober life. <br>  <br>  Addiction isn't a virtue, but if it's truly addiction, it isn't a vice, either.<br>  <br>  If you have to attack Limbaugh on his words and views, that's fair game.

The Congress is by far more in control of the economy than the President, that is why the economy has been sliding into the toilet ever since the Democrats took control of Congress in 2006.  The Dow is down 55% since the Democrats won the 2006 elections and why the Dow drops 200 points every time Barack Obama speaks.|`|AA10096992	As executive, it's Bush's job to enforce the laws and regulations.

I do blame the Democrats for creating it even their intentions were good, by helping the "poor" they ended harming the rich and the poor. Democrats created several programs to help people with low income to have full access to mortgage credits (which is a great idea). Their big mistake was to name the federal government as co-signer o debts secured by the gov.  This made almost everyone a potential buyer, so when a house came to the market there were tens of potential buyers on the line pushing home's prices to the sky. This was started by Jimmy Carter and aggravated during Clinton. I'm sure W Bush was aware of the need to stop the uncontrolled house market but in his first months came 9-11 so the wars became his number one priority. Remember that the collapse came when W Bush on his lasts month in WH intervened Freddie Mac and Freddie Mae. This happen after the situation in Irak improved.|`|39KUKALFaa	The reality of Bush is that the economy tanked because he entered a room where the Dems had spilt gasoline all over the floor and on barrels of oil by forcing bankers to lend to uncreditworthy borrowers.<br>  <br>  A clever and sincere man would have turned off the light and locked the door, while working out how to douse the place in water or something better.<br>  <br>  George decided that he did not care, even though he knew about it, because he proposed legislation that the Democrats blocked.  It would have gone a long way to solve the problem.<br>  <br>  But bad character will out.  He and Cheney were so greedy for Texas and Wyoming that they decided to put the oil price through the roof.<br>  <br>  First, they manipulated the strategic petroleum reserve.  Congress had to close that down.  They were using it as a price support for Arabian oil.<br>  <br>  Second, they refused to police the Iraqi oil fields, so they never recovered production.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, they kept in place Bush I's ban on the drilling offshore.  This was an executive order in addition to the legislative ban.<br>  <br>  Fourthly, they decided that when McCain/Palin was about to win, that they would kill Lehman Brothers to throw Obama the election, because he is against offshore oil drilling.  Bush went on television 3 times before the election to tank the economy.  He could have waited until after the election and he could have bailed Lehman out.  He bailed everyone else out.  Lehman had money market funds like bank accounts and this is what killed intermediation by non-banks.<br>  <br>  The sum of all these is that Bush is not only a crook, but the higher oil prices amounted to the straw that broke the camel's back - in this case, people's budgets.  People could not afford their mortgages.  In prolonging the Iraq War, he is probably capable of being prosecuted for war crimes.  I think that he should be as an example of what happens when you put country last.<br>  <br>  But I agree that he did not create the situation, but he tried to take advantage of it and tanked the economy, the GOP, the country and McCain/Palin.  He is a miserable sob.|`|Wt01utSbaa	What part of personal responsibility causes people to say these sorts of things?<br>  <br>  The recession and collapse of the country was ushered in during the Bush administration... <br>  <br>  What is so hard to understand about that?<br>  <br>  Was he alone?

One line in Limbaugh's speech to CPAC last Saturday sums up the difference between libs and conservatives.  He said, and I paraphrase. " libs want equality and so do conservatives.  The difference is that conservatives want to raise the poor, the libs want to drag down the rich".<br>  <br>  The democrats in power now are afraid that their base will will come to the realization that the libs need to have the poor as their base and desperately want to keep them there for political reasons.

The wait lists are largely exaggerated. My friend just got into a specialist less than a week after seeing her regular doctor. The specialist referred her to have an MRI, which she is getting on Monday, and if the MRI turns up something that she needs to have surgery on, the "wait list" for that right now is 2-3 weeks. Oh, and, by the way, it's not for a life threatening condition or anything like that. It's just for an old knee injury that she aggravated. So, I suppose in all, she's waiting for at the most one month from initial appointment to her surgery.

Understand that much?  Good, let's move on.  The midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys by George W. Bush administration's Department of Justice was unprecedented.  Once U.S. Attorneys are in place it is not okay to then fire certain ones for the reason that they refuse to do the President's partisan bidding.  Once they are in place, the President shouldn't even SNEEZE in their direction.  That's attempting unconstitutional use of the Department of Justice and U.S. Attorneys for his own political purposes.<br>  <br>  These attorneys were directed specifically by Bush's Administration to target possible Democrat voting abuses, and when the attorneys found that it was Republicans who had committed voting abuses instead, they got fired for daring to ferret them out.

I think you either misunderstood the story or wherever you heard it is full of BS.<br>  <br>  <br>  SFC<br>  US Army<br>  Retired|`|dVQdswtTaa	Some people have difficulty with their terms. <br>  <br>  An electrocution is death by electricity. An electric shock is just that, a shock which may or may not produce injury. <br>  <br>  If just getting a shock were called electrocution, I could run a sensational news story claiming that a million kids a year are electrocuted in their own homes merely by rubbing their feet across a carpet.<br>  <br>  The news story did exactly what it was designed to do. It elicited an emotional reaction from you instead of a reasoned out response. <br>  <br>  There have been cases of shoddy workmanship that has killed anywhere from 3 to 13 service members, depending on who you believe. I do not like that this happens, and standards need to be enforced. But I won't be duped by a ratings seeking reporter into an emotional rant that greatly exaggerates the scope of the problem.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	The numbers here don't add up. They may mean there have been electrical shocks that did not kill at that rate. There have been a small number of men, including a Special Forces member who have died because of electrocution. The US contractor hired unqualified contractors who did not properly ground high voltage systems leading to the deaths.<br>  <br>  This is a direct cause of a lack of oversight of military contractors and a former administration who did not care about these types of problems. Don't worry nothing will happen. The same contractors are doing the same crap today. This is the result of having un-accountable contractors do these jobs.<br>  <br>  Frankly, some of them should be in jail.|`|stHOHpe0aa	Electrocution does NOT necessarily mean death by electric shock, it means to kill OR injure:<br>  <br>  electrocute <br>  Verb<br>  <br>  [-cuting, -cuted] to kill or injure by an electric shock<br>  <br>  Collins Essential English Dictionary 2nd Edition 2006 ?

He is blowing smoke up your panties.|`|Cl2VHwVQaa	I agree that people should be outraged.  My husband is in the military and has been deployed twice, and I do not think they should have to worry about being electrocuted, however I don't think that figure is correct.  If we have been in Iraq for 6 years, that would be about 2190 days (give or take because of leap year), 1 soldier every 3 days would be approximately 730 soldiers.  I think someone exaggerated the number, but don't get me wrong every death matters.
bQJzUgiXaa	Seems like the gov'ment don't be giving a care about them own solders.  Maybe is 'bout time we MILITIA MEN got togher and had ourselves a good ole fashion roman "kill the senators" slapp happy hoe down!!  Mutiny.|`|CsSizOhpaa	This to me is further reason why I don't want the government to take over the health care industry.<br>  <br>  If the government is so big that it can't take care of those who are sworn to defend our liberties, freedoms, and way of life, then what makes you think that they would actually be effecient at running health care for 300,000,000 people?<br>  <br>  The company probably will be fired but, there are 10 levels of bureaucracy that the people have to go through to get to the decision makers.|`|4rd5IYouaa	Your tax dollars at work. Instead of getting all bent out of shape and having a hissy fit, you might want to go look in the mirror and ask yourself why you keep paying for it if you don't believe in it? Doesn't make sense does it? So, why are you doing it? Take your "outrage" and stop feeding it....duh! You see, THIS is why foreigners think we americans are so stupid! And with good reason! How can you yourself not see the connection between what you pay for and the end result of your "loyal patronage" You paid for it, and you are STILL complaining!<br>     And before you babble about how you didn't know about it, the Germans already have that excuse, invent one of your own, don't plagiarize someone else's excuse.
ce1KbZBDaa	Fairly good, but the line are too long, if you try doing each line to a standard 4/4 beat, it becomes too fast. Generally war poems are about sad and tranquil moments, so a slower pace is required. Shorten up each line, increase the amount of verses and it will fit the style of people much better.<br>   Also, repeating "the wife of an American soldier" becomes very frustrating to have to repeat constantly. If you just start with it once every four or five lines the poem becoems more fluent.|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	I think it is a fantastic poem.  Very insightful and moving.<br>  <br>  I am the proud daughter-in-law, sister-in-law and aunt of Army and Navy Soldiers, and I appreciate the service of all our brave troops and their families.|`|CAdHpqyOaa	love it|`|lfs8bXSoaa	It's pretty good.  But a little weepy.<br>  <br>  I think all soldiers and their husbands and wives, just like all people of all professions and trades, need to carry out the job they signed up for with professionalism, gratitude, and courage.  <br>  <br>  Believe me, your service is appreciated.|`|54OjRZm8aa	I like it and I wish more people would appreciate the american soldier. Plus I wish more people would go into the military with the thought of saving this country not the pay check but that's impossible.|`|XzAD49iraa	these are really good.|`|wUrTB7DAaa	I like the subject matter, but not the writing style.. there's no set rythm. when writing poetry, readers tend to find poems with a nice, steady rythm far more appealing. keep practicing. =)|`|n8SXykVRaa	Really nice poem :-) and defently makes you think|`|hXQBbOlvaa	The first poem has a  few grammatical errors, but overall is an insightful look at how some Americans view soldiers.  The second poem is much better (in my opinion).  You could also play around with your capitalization in both poems to emphasize your points.  For example, in the first poem you could not capitalize the word when you mention the soldier (putting "american soldier" instead of American soldier or "he's" instead of "He's").  In the second example, you could capitalize the "W" in wife to emphasize her importance while de-captializing the "A" in american soldier.  Those are just a few of my suggestions...

pAVfFAe2aa	If you want equality, then you need to work for it.<br>  <br>  What you are suggesting is from the communist manifesto.<br>  <br>  Your equality would be better understood as follows:<br>  <br>  In college, you make a 4.0 GPA...you have worked hard for that good grade, giving up much, but not all of the social scene of the college experience.<br>  <br>  Your friends however, don't have that great GPA....theirs is a 1.0.....they never studied or sacrificed anything to get the better grade.<br>  <br>  By your standards: YOU should give up 1.5 points of your GPA to the lesser student or equality purposes....are YOU willing to do that?<br>  <br>  Bet not!  Unless you are the 1.0 GPA student....and the economy and rewards of hard work and sacrifice are the same......you are willing to give away something that is not yours to begin with.....why and who are you to do so?

We buy American whenever possible.  However, there isn't much made in America anymore.  Pretty much everything is made overseas.  Even cars manufactored in America have less parts made in America than some foreign cars... weird.<br>  <br>  2.  We don't buy it if we cannot afford it today.  So we spend our money, not borrowed money.  Which I think does help the economy moer than spending on credit.<br>  <br>  3.  We don't have titles of presitge.  :)|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	1. I try to buy American whenever I can.  Some items of clothing don't have tags that tell where they were made.<br>  <br>  2. My family and I live within our means.  We are thrifty and look for bargains.  We don't use credit cards - if we can't buy it with the money we have now, then we do without.<br>  <br>  3. I don't care what my title is.  I am just grateful to have a job.  That said, people's titles need to reflect their positions in an organization.  My General Manager needs to have a title that reflects his authority, just as my assistant needs to have a title that reflects her job.  If they didn't, then how would people know who does what job?|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Less spending doesn't improve the economy.  Spending and then not paying for it is what tanked the economy.  If you don't go to the store a cashier loses her job.  Look at that way.<br>  <br>  I don't know what a title of prestige is.<br>  <br>  There's no real way to know if clothes are made in America or not.

I guess I could start buying more American made products but which ones are? How am I supposed to know? should i check the label on every single thing i buy? what about food and stuff? alot of that isnt from America so where do i buy my food? it seems like a lot of work to look up and study all the brands to find out where it is comeing from. Whom ever is supplying the grocery store needs to find only American made products. <br>  <br>  2. Nobody is spending extra. Nobody has the money to spend extra and even if they did it will not improve the economy only make it worse. think about all the little stores that would go out of business if we didnt buy extra stuff. All the jobs that would be lost if those stores would go out of business? <br>  <br>  3. Im not sure what this is to be honest with you.

NCS applicants should therefore endeavor to protect the fact that they have applied and/or are thinking of applying to the NCS. We urge your discretion throughout the entire hiring process to ensure maximum flexibility for your potential NCS career. Further guidance will be provided as competitive applicants move through the hiring steps.<br>  [Note: NCS means National Clandestine Services.]<br>  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/careers/jobs/view-all-jobs/paramilitary-operations-officer-specialized-skills-officer.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.cia.gov/careers/jobs/view-al...</a><br>  <br>  Yes,  West Point is one of the five federal service academies-usma, usna, usafa, uscga, usmma- and considered a highly selective college. The actual  name is The United States Military Academy. Located  at West Point, New York. Before the formation of the actual Ivy League athletic conference in the 1950's, West Point and Annapolis were also considered to be Ivy League. <br>  A candidate is nominated to west point by his congressman or one of his state's united states senators, the vice president or the president of the united states, or the secretary of the army. Candidates who do not receive LOA's(Letters of Assurance) then compete within their nominating source(s) for an appointment. All west point cadets are  appointed by the president of the united states. <br>  <br>  Each MOC(Member of Congress=reps, senators and vp) can have 5 nominated cadets at west point, 5 nominated midshipmen at annapolis, 5 nominated cadets at the air force academy at any point in time. When a vacancy occurs due to graduation or other separation from the service academy, a MOC may nominate 10 candidates to compete for the appointment.<br>  <br>  To be considered fully qualified,  a candidate must be scholastically, physically and medically qualified, and pass his oral officer interview.<br>  <br>  Candidates that a service academy consider to be scholastically very highly qualified are given LOA's.  Candidates who have received LOA's and are subsequently appointed are not charged off to the MOC as one of his 5 nominated cadets/midshipmen.<br>  <br>  A MOC may:<br>  1) name a principal nomination and rank alternate nominations.<br>  2) name a principal nomination and not rank alternates.<br>  3) name alternate nominations.<br>  <br>  About 25% of MOC name a principal nomination. <br>  <br>  A fully  qualified principal nomination or the highest  ranked alternate nomination that is fully qualified  will receive the appointment regardless of whether there are fully qualified alternate nominations  with higher "whole person scores"  as determined by the service academy. <br>  <br>  Fully qualified candidates who did not receive an LOA and do not receive an appointment from the competition within their nominating source(s) then compete nationally for the offers of appointment that have been declined till the class is filled. <br>  <br>  Great advice for preparing for any service academy or highly selective college:<br>  <a href="http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/preparation/" rel="nofollow">http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/preparation/academic_prep.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/preparation/leadership_prep.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/" rel="nofollow">http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissi...</a><br>  Good Luck!|`|XIZKNNuhaa	Here's some basic info on the careerfield. And yes, West Point is a university. There could be a military commitment after a certain number of years there so you would be better off just going to a regular school, then going into the military, then the CIA.

Here is a nice quote to send you off, Its from David Rockefeller, a man who has more power in the U.S. than anyone in the government, especially Obama.

How can you say this is old business when much of this bill was written with the knowledge that Obama had won and that he would sign just about anything that crossed his desk. It is pretty obvious that the stimulus bill was Obama's attempt to get through as much pork as he could before Americans demand that he live up to campaign promises.<br>  <br>  All of this was trumped by a concerted attempt by Carville, and the rest of the Cronies in league with Rom, to distract America enough to get past this with no debate.<br>  <br>  It is wagging something.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	wagging the dog? no but this is a good way for the government to try <br>  to silence the voice of dissent.<br>  <br>  I never listen to Rush Limbaugh but by Rahm and the admin trying to <br>  silence the voice of dissent~Rush Limbaugh~it just draws more attention to Rush and gives him more publicity|`|wbIEau0qaa	you obviously arent educated in "wag the dog"|`|GfIwCC6saa	Rahm and the admin are raising Rush's ratings.|`|Wt01utSbaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  But I thought you said the Democrats are obsessed with Limbaugh, but every question you ask is about Rush.<br>  <br>  ironic.|`|FpMCFvV5aa	Obama and his flunky need a straw man to mask the fact that, thus far, Obama is a total and complete failure.|`|00edd366abb2b33249aae666469aaa31aa	Steel is, maybe, with his convincing impressions of a slave and a kitty cat.|`|RjhzHcSuaa	Wag the dog?

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	You definitely got the tougher side to argue.  You'll have to be prepared to address all of the strongest arguments against the death penalty.  Among them:<br>  <br>  1. By far the most compelling is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  2. Cost: Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, and the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason #1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.<br>  <br>  3. It is not a deterrent.  Violent crime rates are actually HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida – the most active execution state at the time – to carry out his final murder spree).  It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (see #2), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime.  Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murder…by killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, ‘do as I say, not as I do.’<br>  <br>  4. There’s also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DON’T have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, “I wish you had killed me.”  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death.  In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."<br>  <br>  I hope that helps - good luck in your debate!|`|4qT0TfMZaa	There is no good reason to engage in such barbarism.  It has been conclusively proven that the death penalty does not - I repeat, does NOT - reduce crime.  It merely lowers all of us to the level of the criminal scum we're trying to control.|`|eoXAdLrjaa	Rather than just state "kill those criminals" I will try to answer it a bit more intelligently.  Right now we have generated laws and punishments in American, and similarly other countries have done the same.  The reason for these rules and punishments for breaking them, is to instill a sense of fear into the minds of the possible criminals.  When you are not handicapped to emotional outcomes or handicapped to feeling regret, then the thought of punishment makes you think further about your actions, rather than just acting on impulse.  The death penalty is the ultimate punishment for the most heinous crimes.  The mental stability of the people that usually commit those crimes is low and they usually feel that they are above the law, and many of the repeat offenders have nothing to live for anyway.  Many of them would love the ability to sit in a prison, receive free food, tv, and all the other amenities that are awarded to inmates.  To many of them it would be easier than real life if they were promised life in prison.  If we take away the death penalty we are giving them nothing to fear, and it is almost an incentive to commit the crimes for those who are on this level, with nothing to live for in the "real world".<br>  <br>  I am pro death penalty for the above reason, and for other's but this is my main reason.|`|eAGFE0G6aa	Texas and other states have a "death penalty" industry and the legal apparatus to overview appeals - - to stop it would be a negative message for those who are in the political status quo of that state|`|QTgm2ZTvaa	kill those criminals ^^

d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	Of course Reich is correct. To understand why, consider the almost magical quality in economics (1 = 7). Let me explain.<br>  <br>  A while back, the German Mercedes Benz Corporation built a large factory in Vance, Alabama. The factory employs about 11,000 people.<br>  <br>  Now, what are these people going to do with their income? They will buy houses (which someone has to build). They will buy clothes (which someone has to sell them). They will go to restaurants, movies, etc, etc, etc. <br>  <br>  By creating these jobs Mercedes Benz has indirectly created tens of thousand more jobs. Is Mercedes Benz making a profit on this company? I'm sure we all hope so. But whatever profit they are making is dwarfed by the benefits obtained by the people and the state of Alabama. That's why Reich is correct. A factory owned by General Motors in Germany only benefits the GM stockholders in America; but a foreign company set up in America benefits society.<br>  <br>  As to your other part. Yes, both the Chinese and the Japanese have practiced unfair trade practices in violation of both GATT and the WTO. That they continue to do so is because the US has never pushed them hard enough. And the reason the US hasn't pushed is because of the enormous amount of American debt these countries have purchased.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Cheers.|`|96e31ceb1fe7561cc98bdbb17b080483aa	The way I understand someone as Robert Reich is to read between the lines.

He has a need to be heard from and the desperate need to be vital and important, but fails to recognize the truth as the truth will disagree with his assessments.

Being a Conservative is about upholding and adhering to the Constitution. <br>  Rush Limbaugh supports and believes in the Constitution which is why consevatives support him. <br>  It might benefit you to read the constitution and listen to someone who has an Idea about what America is about instead of wasting your time listening to whatever garbage you are spouting on here.|`|AA11206283	I bet you voted for Bill Clinton.<br>  <br>  Case Closed.|`|oojO4WAraa	People are always able to forgive their own.

Democracy does not always work.<br>  <br>  If the majority voters voted to remove the rights of women to vote, own property, etc... thus putting them back to 2nd class citizen, would that seem reasonable?  What about removing the rights for racial minorities on a state by state basis?  Should that be allowed if the majority votes for it? Some of the southern states would still have slavery I expect, or at least 2nd class citizenship for racial minorities.  <br>  <br>  To remove the rights of any minority does not seem reasonable.  The history of the United States has illustrated this many times over, but we are slow to learn.|`|AA10465540	Your concepts of democratic and republican are a bit too narrowly interpreted to really answer your question.  Proposition 8 is similar to one that was proposed and defeated before.  It was sparked by a California Supreme Court decision that found the restriction of marriage to only heterosexual couples to be unconstitutional.  The same Supreme Court could nullify proposition 8 for the same reason or  a new proposition could be proposed that would change the law yet again.  California is just like that.  things change there.|`|8RflQ9DVaa	Prop 8 WAS the overturning. And it's hard to fight the HUGE sums of money that were used to get it passed.

No way are they gonna support Prop 8,  more likely more will vote against it.|`|smNue2tUaa	Yes, it will be overturned because is was unconstitutional and illegal.  You can not amend the California state constitution to take away rights that already existed by a simple majority vote.  It would require a constitutional convention.  Just because there is a majority vote does not make it legal or constitutional.  Just like someone above said, would it be right if a majority voted to take away the rights from women or racial minorities?  ..No!<br>  <br>  Those who insist that marriage is not a right and it is religious institution, you must realize that there in a separation on church and state in this great land.  Therefor Prop 8 is VOID.<br>  <br>  Even the republican governor believes that Prop 8 should be overturned<br>  <br>  Proposition 8 will be overturned, it's gonna happen.  "Whether you like or not!"|`|fnXMF09baa	The issue before the court is not about "gay marriage." The issue is whether the voters have the right to amend the state's constitution. Even "experts" on the no on 8 side think at prop 8 will be upheld.<br>  <br>  The voters have spoken TWICE. We don't want gay marriage. The voters decision MUST be upheld or this will be a mockery of democracy.<br>  <br>  While this will probably go to the US Supremes, I doubt they will hear it since this is a state issue. I wish they would just get on with life and stop the lawsuits. The no on 8 actually spent more money than the yes on 8 group so they can't say they didn't have a chance to defeat this in November!<br>  <br>  Prop 8 never was about gay rights. It's a definition of marriage. Voters want marriage to be between a man and a woman! Get on with life, PLEASE!|`|43zXRpLYaa	Here's the problem: marriage is a man and a women getting together and making a union. Now, gays, a man and a man, or a woman and a woman want to get together and call that marriage, but it's not. Marriage is a man and a woman and that's the way it's been for 1,000's of years. A tree is a tree, an orange is an orange. Just because people want to now call an orange a fire hydrant, it's still and orange and not a fire hydrant.<br>  <br>  Most likely the liberal courts in Mexifornia will overturn it because that is what they ALWAYS do. They could care less what is right or wrong, or what the laws the VOTERS pass.|`|IqyIch2Taa	If prop 8 is overturned, it would yet another example of judicial tyranny and legislating from the bench. nothing new to liberals who want it both ways.

It's got letters from soldiers away from home and some letters from home to the soldiers. It dates back past the Civil War, I think, and goes all the way through Desert Storm. It was compiled before most of the Iraq and Afghanistan stuff. Some of the letters are even from famous people, including past presidents, during their military service.<br>  <br>  He actually wrote a 2nd book with letters from military members of other countries, take Japan during WW2 for example. I haven't read it, but it would also be an interested read to see what the other side was thinking.

DlVuee1jaa	because people are full of proud and hate. ppl hate each other. you hate russians , americans, jews etc. why do you hate them? Because of jealousy. The US is a greatest and strongest country. Russia is the biggest and rich in natural resourses, nice ppl. All hate jews because they have money and they are smart etc.<br>  <br>  ppl are racists. ppl hate anybody who is different. the problem is inside us human beings. As said Jeesus ppl do not love each other and that is it. there is no other reason.ppl love money more than humans. that is why there are jobless and homeless. many cannot stand it and start taking narcotics drugs etc. Love your enemy, jeesus said. look at the Palestine and Israel they are fighting for land. How about other cheek? Never. So we will never have peace. Ppl must be wise but the emotions take over and ppl loose their minds hating each other and eating each other alive. ppl are dying bc they have no money for health care for heart operation etc. no one cares. all care about money only. The biggest reason is fear of death. ppl think that with death comes an end. but it is not so. That is why ppl kill each other thinking they punish others with death. but they change nothing by killing their enemy. ppl do not have faith in that ppl do not die. that ppl have iternal life. if ppl  belived in what jeesus said that we do not die, they would stop killing each other and the wars would stop.<br>  <br>  all wars are because of money, hate and jelousy and that ppl have no faith in that we are iternal. Proof? You will not get the proof. The wise man knows the proof without proof and thus the man tested on his wiseness. Jeesus was the wisest man on the earth.<br>  <br>  Only wise men go to paradise. Stupid ones, who do not have love in their hearts, who cannot control their hate, who do not accept life as it is, as it was given to men by nature stay there where they belong too.|`|PPKuHl9baa	There is no peace without war. You can't have two nations interact nicely and send fruit baskets and lovely flowers to each other on their birthdays. It doesn't work that way. Before there is peace, there must be war. One nation has to completely take out another and then a treaty is signed. Then there is peace. <br>  Do you think that when we were bombed at Pearl Harbor we would send them a note that said, "Oh come on Japan! What's up with that? That was harsh!" NO! We went to war with them. We beat them, we signed a treaty and now there is peace between us and them. Everlasting peace. Our trade centers were bombed, we went to war, the war is almost at an end, there will be peace between us and Iraq after all is said and done. Everlasting peace? Probably not, but some kind of peace. War comes first, then peace.|`|jrdtQi04aa	Because people jsut cant seem to get along.  A lot of these wars are based on religion.  A lot of these people believe in actually wiping out someone of different faiths.  They want to kill them all.  Men, women, children, everyone.  They will even kill the dogs.  Some folks are greedy.  They want your oil, or your land.  They dont want you to worship as you see fit.  It probably all really comes down to money.  Most wars are about money.|`|RdfPFIOoaa	because ppl have forgotten how to work out their problems with words. it has nothing to do with the men. one thing iv'e learned in 18 years is that women are usually quicker to fight and they hold grudges for much longer. guys fight one time and let it go.|`|kynzqmWgaa	Cause if it were filled with peace, there would be no need to have separate countries and governments.

ULTRJJ6waa	Hi. People need to realize that he can't fix the world's problems in a month. Geez, give the guy some time before beating him down. I think he will help the country, but it won't happen overnight. There's a lot of damage to repair. I believe him when he promises to do what he can to help the economy. Anything would be an improvement at this point :-)|`|ZDN8XD6taa	He just spent 760 billion dollars on a resolve that is not absolutely sure to solve our economic problems and the funds are being used fast.  If that 760 billion dollar stimulus package runs out before the economy is fixed, not only US but the international stock market will fall apart.  As a result, every country in the world will be plunged into poverty as we are totally dependent upon trade and globalization.  Moreover, agricultural businesses are failing on an international scale and it wil get worse through the years resulting to famine.  If food is a problem, everything becomes a problem.  Obama should now be concerned of fixing world poverty rather than just the US recession.  If the third world countries, who happen to be the international producers suffer, we all suffer.  It's just like a pyramid where we happen to be on the top.  If you knock out the foundation, everything goes down.<br>  <br>  If you ask me, it's too early to say if he is a good president but for now, I would say the he is not.  As I am seeing, he only has Plan A (stimulus plan) and no Plan B.  The solution that he has come up with is too risky and useless spending still occurs.  If his Plan A fails, what is to happen to the rest of us?  When our government can no longer help us, how can we help ourselves?  We should be more focused on that<br>  <br>  He indeed brings hope to people but hope is not what we need right now.  What we need is a solution and a good strategy that has not just been thought off for just a couple of months.|`|CsSizOhpaa	He is running so far to the left, that I don't even think he can see the middle anymore.<br>  <br>  The way he and the Democrats are rushing to nationalize the mortgage industry, the automotive industry, the health care industry, the banking industry, pension plans, and so on and so forth, plus the way he almost assuredly will at least try to silence voices of dissent (talk radio, net neutrality, etc.) by using one of three tactics (Local content, diviersity of ownership, or fairness doctrine), plus the way they are expanding the welfare state, refusing to explore for oil, natural gas, etc., also how they insist on burning food (corn) for fuel, refusing to expand the greenest of energy sources (nuclear), and so many other things are going to lead to a revolt by the American Citizens and when he is up for re-election if the Republicans put up a better candidate then they did in 2008, he will go down in history as the worst President ever. Not to mention how his foreign policy is a flashback to 1993-2001, where that the FBI and CIA were barred from sharing information lead to us being attacked on 9/11. I pray to God, there is not another terrorist attack ever again, especially during the Obamanation that will be the next 4 years.<br>  <br>  I feel he is emmulating hte likes of Hugo Chavez, Robert Mugabe, and Fidel Castro, all of which are totalitarian dictators.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	If you look at the markets he is not helping any.

2bkV73gpaa	Want to talk about something you can't undo? He could have killed someone while driving drunk. And you might be held liable.<br>  <br>  He should be more humiliated that he was driving drunk than because he wet his pants.<br>  <br>  Take away his license and his car. He's obviously very irresponsible and immature.|`|6cTj2iOAaa	No specific 'right to pee' that I am aware of, beyond the prohibition against cruel and unusual treatment.  You would have to prove they intended to cause him undue maltreatment to prevail in your case.<br>  <br>  Giving he was drunk while driving, you are not likely to get much support or legal assistance unless you have incontrovertible evidence, such as a video, showing they intended to humiliate and harm him.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, a little humiliation was likely in order.  He's alive and apparently, didn't kill anyone.  Count it as a victory, and move on.|`|YQRDr3Lkaa	I think that the humiliation of your sons accident is the least of your worries.  You should be more concerned with the fact that he was breaking the law and was arrested for doing so.  Personally, I do not think that it would set a good example for you, the parent, to pursue legal action against the police force essentially showing your lack of respect for the law and almost excusing the fact that he committed a crime in the first instance.|`|zabgS2apaa	Are you having a laugh? He was DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE you stupid woman. He deserved everything he got and if he had killed someone, a child maybe? would you be taking such a moral high ground? You have got no rights at all to be taking legal action against anybody. Your son was at fault, fact. They are not obliged in any way to uncuff him and let him go to the toilet, and hopefully he has learnt his lesson and wont be so stupid and selfish in future. You should think about what your parenting skills say about you too.|`|il36RWQDaa	You should be glad that your son didn't get himself or someone else seriously hurt or killed. And he's going to feel more humiliated after he goes to court on his charges and get put on probation, plus pay the fines for his mistake. I hope he learned a better lesson from his experience other than he should go to the bathroom before getting arrested.|`|AA10503123	what?  your son has committed 2 very serious crimes and your upset because he pissed on himself!

What would your response be had your son rear ended a family and killed them all?|`|zlmnfFpYaa	You may think this is harsh, but it seems to me your son has learned a very valuable lesson.  Trying to shift some sort of blame to the police is exactly the wrong thing to be demonstrating right now.  The blame lies with one person and one person only, that is your son.  The sooner he realizes that negative actions have negative consequences, the better.|`|irxnnhnEaa	So, your son, who was illegally drinking, and then worse, drinking and driving, pissed in his pants and this is what you are upset over?<br>  <br>  My guess is that with your priorites so messed up, your son is going to end up in jail A LOT more times.<br>  <br>  You should be ashamed of yourself as a parent|`|PHOyKsmPaa	He was drunk and probably urinated on himself because he was scared. Why don't you think of the people your son could have killed instead of his "humiliation". Are you kidding???|`|oocV6d0taa	Your kid is peeing everywhere.|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	Your son has had his license for one month and is arrested for drunk driving and you are worried about peed pants. He peed his pants because he was scared and drunk. That is so common in young heavy drinkers anyway. You need to start shifting your anger back at yourself for allowing this to happen.  Can you imagine if someone were killed.  It takes a good year or two before a driver is a safe driver and now your son has a strike against him. Next time he may kill someone and then this will have been the first offense so the penalty will be much more severe.  It is more likely that he peed himself before he got in the cruiser. That is why the back seats are plastic and have a drain hole for drunks in case they pee themselves or vomit all over the place.  They can just hose it out and get ready for the next bunch of hoodlums.|`|voX1bRvNaa	Generally they don't allow one to use the bathroom until the alcohol test is given because the subject may ingest something and because the subject must be kept under constant observation for 15-20 minutes before the test. <br>  Be glad that he was stopped and removed from the road before he killed or was killed. If the humiliation keeps him from driving drunk again, and it was my kid, I'd applaud it. In 34 years I've seen a lot of dead kids in drunk driving accidents, and I've also had to tell the parents of a teenage (more than once) that their kids are dead.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	He got scared and peed in his pants?<br>  <br>  They may sent you the bill to clean the cruiser.<br>  <br>  Let me guess: single mom? ....and a perfect son.... right.|`|wwzoqIvVaa	I think you asked a ? a few minutes ago about finding something under your son's bed.  It is unfortunate that many of our officers seem to have a bullying issue and lack humanity sometimes.  I wonder how they would feel if it was their son being denied the bathroom.  Sad, and I'm sorry he has to go through that.  Being arrested is a harsh thing.  I'm glad no one got more hurt than that if he was driving while impaired.  Good Luck with your son.  I hope all works out.|`|AA11280073	He probably peed in his pants because he was scared. You should be more concerned about his drinking that the fact that he was "humiliated."<br>  He deserved to be humiliated. What if he had killed himself or someone else while he was driving under the influence? On top of that, he is an underage drinker. You have more to be upset about than his wetting himself. You have misplaced anger and you are in denial.|`|oojO4WAraa	This was a lesson your son needed.  He was an idiot to drive under the influence. <br>  <br>  The police are not required to let your little boy go pee on demand.  Thats the way it works when you are arrested, especially for DUI - they do not let you go potty. It isn't grade school <br>  <br>  He needs to grow up and realize he should do everything in his power to avoid putting himself in a situation like this again.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	Take action on the police department because your son was taken into custody for being drunk while driving a car, and he was a minor at the time?  You make me laugh!<br>  <br>  If it was possible I would add a "cleaning fee" to his fines to compensate the officer that had to clean up the mess he left in the patrol car.<br>  <br>  You are lucky the officer stopped your son from driving while intoxicated, if he had not been caught you might have been called to the Emergency Room or morgue for your son after his crash!  Humiliation at wetting your pants is bad ... injuries received in an accident are worse, and tend to have a longer effect on a person's quality of life.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	haha Misty M is right.. yea he should have gone before getting arrested.<br>  <br>  Ma'am your priorities are messed up! You're more worried that the peace officers didn't let a drunk guy take a piss than the fact that YOUR son was DUI?!<br>  Of course his hands were behind his back, that's what police do to people who don't follow the rules.<br>  Nothing can undo the humiliation that your son suffered? He brought that on himself when he a) drank something that he knew he shouldn't and b) GOT IN A FREAKING CAR with it.<br>  Nothing can undo the harm that your son could have caused. Your son could have made someone lose their life, be glad he didn't.<br>  You can't take legal action against some police who take in a drunk guy just because drunk guy pees his pants! Oh my gosh if that were the case then why would he want cops in the first place?<br>  You obviously weren't responsible enough to keep your kid from doing that/ teaching and instructing your child so that they know what's wrong.<br>  Your son learned a lesson: drive drunk and put others in danger= get embarrassed and face consequences.<br>  Your priorities need rearranging ma'am.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	Exactly when did your son spring a leak?<br>  I'm sure they probably allowed him access to a toilet once they got him back to their station, but you can't reasonably expect the cops to be able to provide plumbing facilities while they're still investigating a suspect on the scene.|`|Z0I5Qvk7aa	*laughing* God, you have some messed up priorities. Drunk people piss themselves all the time... He was arrested for a DUI, he could've killed someone. Personally, I think the police did him a favor. Maybe next time he won't drink and drive. Lesson learned.|`|UgZq1pXjaa	You should have made him wear one of the diapers you found under his bed since you said this in another post.  I think you are the one with a diaper fetish since your other 5th grader wears diapers 24/7 and you want him to make friends in your neighborhood.  Are you in diapers now??|`|AA10465540	You will find yourself up against a pretty powerful system.  The potential gain from any lawsuit would be wiped out by the legal costs.  The D.U.I. especially an underage one, trumps the inconvenience he found himself in.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	If I read your question correctly, he announced that he had to go to the bathroom while in the car???  What were they supposed to do?  Pull over, uncuff him,  and send him to the nearby bushes?<br>  <br>  Sorry about your son's self-made luck, but "I have to go" is one of the oldest escape tricks in the book.  Once they get him into a processing area, where he's locked in, they can let him go to the bathroom, but even then he'd have to be searched first.  What if he went in to eat his hidden drugs, or to pull out his hidden weapon and either hurt them or himself?  These are things that have to be considered.  Once that's all reasonably-well ruled out, he can go, but until then he's just going to have to hold it.  <br>  <br>  That said, I fall right in line with the others here.  He could've killed who-knows-how-many people, and you're worried about  him wetting his pants when drunk?  Pfffft.|`|kiOD8s8Kaa	From reading your questions. it sounds like you have two sons, both with bladder control issues: your fifth-grade son who still wears diapers, and your teenage son who wears adult diapers at night (or maybe all the time).<br>  <br>  It sounds like you had a problem in potty training both of your sons.  What's going to happen to them in the real world when they're stuck in line somewhere, or waiting for something other than an arrest, and they tinkle all over themselves?  Moreover, if you've raised your older son to think that driving under the influence is OK, it sounds like you've made another big mistake in raising your kids.<br>  <br>  I was going to suggest a urologist, but now I'm thinking that an intensive outpatient psychiatric program would be more appropriate.  Or maybe foster parenting.|`|qwaWd14vaa	1. "He told them he needed the bathroom, but they did not uncuff him."<br>  What are they suppose to do? Let him out, uncuff him and urinate on the side walk? Urinate in public for all too see? Then the public would be at an outcry.<br>  <br>  2. "Nothing can undo the humiliation my son suffered, but maybe if I take legal action against the police force, it won't happen to someone else in the future."<br>  So you are not upset that your son was out drunk driving, with his friends after getting his license to drive only a month ago?<br>  You are not thinking, well if he did not drink in excess, he probably would not have had a full bladder, would not have had to pee, and probably could have controlled his bladder if he was not drunk.<br>  <br>  It's a parent(s) like you, they need to arrest for allowing your son to operate a 2500 lb Bob Sled while drunk. Then shift the Blame, to being more worried about your son peeing on himself, rather then whom he may have killed in his first month of driving.<br>  Thank GOD the police stopped your son now, within his first month of driving, too show the court how much of an idiot he is as well as irresponsible and self centered.<br>  Like they say Like father like son, I hope he does not get to drive for a year.|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	As everyone with sense/experience has said:<br>  he had no right to use the restroom.<br>  <br>  - you want the officer to uncuff somebody and let them pee in public?<br>  "nothing can undo the humiliation"<br>  - nothing can undo your son plowing into a mini-van and killing a family of 6.....maybe some humiliation will help prevent that in the future<br>  <br>  The fact that you say he was "celebrating"<br>  instead of "being extremely irresponsible and endangering the lives of countless innocent people"<br>  And the fact that you're trying to place blame on the officer(s) who got this dangerous person off the road....<br>  Will only hurt your son.<br>  Maybe it's this kind of attitude that lead him to believe he can drink and drive?<br>  <br>  I'm not saying this to be mean.....<br>  But it seems as if you're lacking some common sense <br>  <br>  <br>  Again though, he had no right to use the restroom.<br>  And trust me, no officer wants somebody to clean up pee....they'll do what they can to avoid having people wet themselves

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	I supported capital punishment for a long time, but the more I learned about it, the more I came to oppose it.  In the end, several factors changed my mind:<br>  <br>  1. By far the most compelling is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  Really, that should be reason enough for most people to oppose it. If you need more, read on:<br>  <br>  2. Cost: Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, and the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason #1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.<br>  <br>  3. The deterrent effect is questionable at best. Violent crime rates are actually HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida – the most active execution state at the time – to carry out his final murder spree).  It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (see #2), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime.  Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murder…by killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, ‘do as I say, not as I do.’<br>  <br>  4. There’s also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DON’T have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, “I wish you had killed me.”  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death.  In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."<br>  <br>  5. Most governments are supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible.  The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty.  For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects “an eye for an eye” (Matthew 5:38-39).  James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice.  In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	A ridiculous punishment. Death is not a punishment, rather we are freeing the criminal from paying for his crimes.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	A sad necessity. It's justice for some deeds.|`|AA11297232	I am all for it.

Our justice system has proven to have huge flaws and we should respond accordingly by not putting people to death.   If they live on and are found at sometime during their incarceration, not to be guilty, then they have the opportunity to be relaeased.  If however, it is found they are not guilty and we have put them to death, then what? No man has the right to take another's life, even if we try and justify it through legalities.|`|boVKnnFCaa	I personally think if someones done something THAT bad, they don't deserve and ending, they deserve to suffer.|`|yU2MbiTCaa	DEAD-ON!|`|hgX6Gnpeaa	life sux, it should be used often
XLSfTnISaa	No. I am a city officer and can perform a stop on my section of the interstate, as long as its in my jurisdiction.|`|9PAavWnyaa	No, not true. Any law enforcement officer can enforce the law. The detaining officer will probably call the state police for further action, but they can pull you over. Think about it:  a police from one of the outlying areas in a county has delivered a prisoner to the county lock up in the city. She's back on her way to her jurisdiction and sees a person driving erratically on the interstate. It is her obligation, in the interest of public safety, to get that person off the highway.|`|0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	As long as any roadway goes through a particular law enforcement jurisdiction, that police agency can stop a car on the highway.<br>   <br>  This means any law enforcement officer, city...county...or state police can stop you on any roadway, city...county...or state highway!|`|voX1bRvNaa	Not true. I have stopped many vehicles on the Interstate. We as municipal police don't generally patrol the highway, but may be out there either returning from a hospital or jail trip, or we may have been called for mutual assistance by the state police, who are tied up on another matter. If we see a violation we wil stop it, and either issue a ticket ourselves , or we can call the state police violation, depending on the violation. The most frequent reason we are called out there is drunk drivers, and those we arrest ourselves.|`|Zr0fShabaa	No it is not.  City police have jurisdiction over the portions of Interstate Highway that transit their city boundaries.  Sheriffs have jurisdiction over portions that transit their counties.  As a general rule, they have interlocal agreements as to which agency polices what stretch of highway.  That is more a matter of economics rather than law.|`|IBr52ecsaa	Not true fact They can pull you over anytime an anywhere .They are called  state police so that means the whole state

4oCADms6aa	If you mean a gateway to being stoned, then yes. If you mean does marijuana lead to the use of other drugs, I'd have to say no, not really.  Some people move on to using harder stuff, but plenty of folks just smoke pot and never do anything else.  Still others don't ever smoke weed but use heroin or crack (or whatever) exclusively.<br>  <br>  As for decriminalising it, I see no reason why it's been made against the law in the first place.  It's a matter of personal choice, not something to be outlawed or decided upon by the government.  For far too long the federal government has been getting too big for its britches, deciding what we as citizens can and cannot do, what they will and will not allow.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a joint to roll.  This stuff's not going to smoke itself...|`|zLUQJxJkaa	No it isn't necessarily a gateway drug.<br>  No it shouldn't be decriminalized. For these reasons (I have hundreds more reasons but here's a short list):<br>  - Marijuana, if legal, would be much easier for younger children to get their hands on.<br>  - It DOES cause damage, and if used improperly (as is almost always the case outside of legal prescription) does do harm.<br>  - Marijuana comes from somewhere. Drug dealers are more than just drug dealers, they are ALWAYS very violent criminals. Legalize what they sell and you're supporting criminals.<br>  - Drug money very often goes almost directly to terrorists. Yes you heard me, they DO use drugs to gain money. That's one area where they get it from.<br>  <br>  I think that alcohol isn't good either. It is also a drug.. but at least it doesn't come from criminals and terrorists.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	If there's really such a thing as a "gateway" drug, then alcohol and religion should be illegal as well.|`|vRY2vExRaa	Marijuana is not a gateway drug.  The term "gateway" is a red herring ( does having sex lead to prostitution?).<br>  I have always been for the decriminalization of it because it just makes no sense to label people as criminals for their use of a drug that is far less physically and emotionally debilitating than alcohol.|`|VSiMrZkOaa	No I don't think it's a gateway drug at all, there are people that have been smoking pot all their lives and that's all they do and they have never tried anything else. And yes I do think it should be legalized, and in return alcohol should be made illegal! We had a big discussion about this in my criminal law class, and alcohol is sooo much worse than marijuana, I mean have you ever heard of anyone coming home after they smoked a joint and beat the sh!t out of their wife?!|`|spuz7DvNaa	I hope they legalize all drugs so liberals will be high all the time not to mention the disease drug users pass on to each other. Maybe while liberals are busy being stoned we can get the country back on track.|`|Ke4ZtUoOaa	No I don't.  Actually, I think that alcohol is the gateway drug, and it's legal.
GL240ih0aa	Logically, it should. I dont even like the stuff and i think it should. Alcohol is a much more dangerous drug that is responsible for infinitely more deaths, yet its legal. So wheres the logic in that right? And then you have the unlimited healing properties of marijuana, helps build appetite in cancer patients to keep them alive, fights (yes fights) emphysema, the list literally goes on. Hell Ive even seen new studies that show marijuana THC kills MRSA flesh eating bacteria, the new superbug that has scientist scared. The U.S. just has it all ***-backwards on this subject, and they spend too much time making adds and mis-informing people that marijuana is some kind of evil thing. If anyone saw the videos they used to show in schools a long time ago where they would tell you if you smoked it, your babies would be deformed, knows the kind of crap the government tried to feed the public. Honestly if anyone thinks that marijuana is bad, they simply do not know ANYTHING about it. An amazing plant that has been used since the dawn of time to cure countless ailments.|`|wg78UkxFaa	No I don't.  I know a guy who smoked marijuana for years and didn't use any other illegal drugs.  He's not be as sharp as he use to be, it seemed to mess with his memory.  He wasn't some one who sat around smoking it 24/7 or any thing like that, it was more recreational use just once in a while.  But as I have said he's not the same as he use to be, and that's sad.  <br>  <br>  I have talked with a few other people who know him and they have said the same thing about him.  He's a good person, but he made a mistake smoking it for all of the years that he did.<br>  <br>  He quit smoking it about 10 years ago,  I'm really proud of him for having done so.  <br>  <br>  He seems a lot happier since he no longer smoke it.  Also he made the comment that since he quit smoking it he doesn't feel so with drawn when he's around other people.  I often wonder if when he started smoking it that he shut him self off to others in a way.   So that his mental growth some what stopped as well, sort of keeping him at the age of where he was when he first started smoking it.<br>  <br>  So no I don't think that it should be made legal.  I think that any illegal drug that people use can have long term affects on the body and they are not always going to be good affects.   <br>  <br>  Just my views.  God bless!<br>  <br>  BTW: For the  people saying that all illegal drugs should be made legal you obviously have never seen a pregnant mother stung out on heroin have you?  It isn't a pretty sight to have to see.  <br>  <br>  It's a sad seeing that and knowing that her baby is going to born addicted to heroin,  that baby didn't ask for that.  While the woman may make the choice for her self to use drugs.  Babies are not able to make that same choice for them selves, where they end up being born addicted to drugs.  So that when they are born they are born addicted to drugs they are  sick, shaking, overly small and every noise that they hear makes them jump due to being sick.  Nothing calms them down because they are addicted to drugs, and they are going through with drawls.  How sad is that?|`|xcvuJfKMaa	It absolutely should be.  It would stop a great deal of illegal activity in our society, as alcohol prohibition had proven to be a mistake, it only leads to escalated criminal activity and gang wars and death.  Especially over a drug that is no more harmful than alcohol and has, in some cases medicinal use. It could provide revenue through taxation for our gov., and could be regulated by a legal age limit, as well as where it is allowed to be grown. It would create jobs, thats for sure, (transportation industry, sales, shipping and receiving, warehousing and storage, and DISTRIBUTION). lol.|`|nkr0Nvemaa	No. If it was what would our politicians rally against to get their base excited. It would also lead to less funding for the police. Who cares if it is readily available throughout the US. That our Presidents have smoked it and so have most of the Congressmen.|`|GQ63zs4Taa	yes i think that it should be.   alcohol has much worse effects on the body than marijuana.  and if the government legalized it there is a lot of money to be made selling it.|`|c695e3d842e5ce7f37359934a75d6b3caa	Yes.  For medical reasons only.

And all drugs should be given away free by the government.  This would totally destroy all of the drug lords within 24 hours.  The cost in dollars would be a tiny fraction of all the money now "going to waste" to fight the "drug war", all the money lost through crime (stealing, robbery and murder, etc.), and all the law-enforcement time spent for nothing.<br>  <br>  Give it away --- with the only stipulation being that it is for one "fix".  This, to eliminate dealing.  Everybody gets a fix, just sign on the dotted line.  What a difference this would make.  And do not start with the bleeding heart crap about "saving these people".  Nobody cares!  Just as they do not care about alcoholics, who have a proven disease.|`|UDQqY3pHaa	All drugs should be made legal and controlled. The main danger form drugs are the criminal gangs that profit from their sales. Switzerland has proven that legalizing heroin can reduce its use dramatically. If we are serious about curtailing drug use we need to use different tactics than prohibition. Remember Al Capone? He made millions off prohibition of alcohol and killed dozens in the process. <br>  <br>  The critical element of the drug trade is greed. If a dealer wants to sell more  he must always be working to expand his market. If the profit motive is removed then the gangs disappear, the violence ends, the active marketing of dangerous substances goes away. <br>  <br>  The war on drugs has made strange allies in the continued prohibition of street drugs; drug gangs and law enforcement. They both want drugs to be kept illegal. What does that tell you?|`|MM8rqTMtaa	If you legalize it and apply the same legal age limit as alcohol - 21 -, 50% of pot smokers will be using it illegally anyway.  The government isn't going to "tax the hell out of it" as people will just grow their own.  If they tried to tax it, there would continue to be large law enforcement issues.|`|9PAavWnyaa	Marijuana should be legalized for two reasons: for the taxes it would generate, and, everyone would be high (a direct or contact high) and then would care less about the sorry state of affairs in the country.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	i think it should be.they spend billions a year to stop it.and there is more pot than there ever was before.i say lets make it legal.tax it like we do alcohol.make a age limit like 18 or 21. it is stupid to spend that money on this.
QI74CxD0aa	Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.<br>  <br>  In too many places union bosses abuse their power.  Workers suffer. Customers suffer.  Taxpayers suffer.  And the economy suffers.<br>  <br>  Many organizations were founded for good purposes, but over time they just became instruments to further the interests of a controlling minority.  This tendency was recognized by the founding fathers of our country when they carefully set up "check and balances."  We need checks and balances in other places a s well.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	all unions are is microsocialisms.where the few take care of the unproductive.all union states have the lowest gdp.that is a fact!|`|3oNcHdgCaa	For better or worse, unions are legal. They have their good points and their bad points, and some organizations are better than others. If a bunch of employees in a company decide that they need one and they don't want you "ruining the curve" and making the rest of them look bad, there's not much you can do about it except leave. Fortunately, people in most workplaces these days are independent and don't see a need for unions anyway. And at least labor unions today generally aren't involved in organized crime, and you don't have to worry about winding up buried in concrete if you cross them.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Here is some reality for you...<br>  Several years ago I was in a union and working at a car dealership.The union was Machinists and Aerospace Workers.I was making $8.00 an hour as a mechanic.Our porters who were in the same union went on strike for more pay and I was forced to honor their picket line.I was paid from the union while we were off work and the porter's ended up settling for a wage of $7.45 an hour.(this was in the 70's).It pissed me off because I had to buy my tools to do my job,and I also had to know what I was doing as a mechanic.They however did not have to know anything and made almost as much money as I did and did not have to buy tools.<br>  <br>  Fair   NO.<br>  <br>  Now on the reverse side---I worked at a dealership that was non union and had worked there for 7 1/2 years busting my butt and never missed a day.I had been promoted to assistant parts manager and worked in that posistion for 1 1/2 yrs.Due to a business decision to sell after market parts and wanting to expand sales down in the Rio Grand valley they wanted a spanish speaking sales associate.The person that they wanted to hire would only accept if he were made assistant manager,so they demoted me and cut my pay by $2.000.<br>  per month.Naturally I did not like that and put in for a transfer to another dealership that this same company owned to keep my same general salary.They fired me even though other employees had done transfers for one reason or another.And Texas being a right to work state means that they do not have to have a reason to fire you.<br>  <br>  Fair?  NO<br>  <br>  So, there are good points and bad about unions.Beside when you talk about workers only doing what they have to,the government is a prime example of having workers that are only there because of their color and not their ability.I have stories about that too......|`|Vgk8VnXwaa	With laws that are now in place, such as wage and hour provisions and laws regarding discrimination, unions have become largely irrelevant for the American worker.  Unions have become nothing more than a fund raising arm of the democratic party.  If you want $100 per month of your wages going to the dems in the form of union dues, vote union.  After all, everyone can see all the good they are doing for the auto industry.|`|0Yyl68oDaa	If your questions is:  Are Unions necessary in to today's workplace?  Then one must ask the sub question: "Necessary for whom?   <br>  <br>  Who benefits from Unions?   <br>  <br>  Employers, do benefit from union in some trade jobs, in that a company does not have to hire a full time employee for the occasional plumbing, electrical, or HVAC job.   --- A Union sub-contractor would supplied a trained and local city "licensed" (i.e. taxed) worker for such short term jobs.<br>  <br>  Worker, due to the deterioration of public education, can benefit from unions --- since unions offer training as small part of their "dues".  Sadly, training could (should) could be obtained from education in schools or vo-tech colleges (often funded by state dollars).   But do to political skulduggery --- a A+ student of a vo-tech college electrician, plumber, carpenter program is not likely to obtain a "license" to do business in a city:    Milwaukee is one such city:  You can be an electrical engineer working for a utility company yet you cannot legal obtain a permit (tax) to change a light switch or move a panel box.  You can pay a $150.00 fee to have a "recommended" union electrician who has a license to pull the permit (fee extra)--- you do the work --- call this cretin give another $75 or $100.  when done.  He calls the inspector ---  both arrive a your home ---they drink a coffee, talk about  their buxom clients and the inspector signs the proper paper work.  <br>  <br>  Would love to see an unbiased study of electrical fires between licensed electricians and home owner electrician  both being inspected by a unbiased neutral inspector.<br>  <br>  Politician benefit from unions since union dues have artfully been arranged as a tax deductible political pay off --- If you gave $50/week to your bank with instructions to the bank to transfer $10/wk to a political party account -- That $520 dollars could not be deducted from current income due to its political nature:   Unions workers can deduct the whole $2600 dues ---- Union also supply manpower to do lit drops call phones or to encourage voters to think their way.   <br>  <br>  As your story noted --- unions are not a meritocracy, then encourage sloth on a job ---<br>  <br>  Another sub-question is:  Does governmental licensure improve the quality/ quanitity of work, does it improve health/safety, to it encourage innovations?|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	You need to strike a balance between the company and the Unions. Too much power to the company and you get unfair dismissals and workers get treated shoddily.<br>  <br>  Too much power to the Unions, and no work gets done. <br>  <br>  They are necessary as a guardian of employee rights, but not anything more than that.

At that trial you can examine the cop.  The cop will testify to your statement that you weren't paying attention and the court will consider that if you testify that you were indeed paying attention and are certain that you stopped.  However, if you are asking how the judge will rule, I cannot guess.|`|nYgUfUd7aa	Do go to court.

I mean a complete stop.  he didn't have to give you the ticket though, he could have just let you go with a warning or just not stop you at all, like normally.  but if you did not come to a complete stop, it's running a stop sign.  also, if your front tires are ahead of the white line, it is running through an intersection, no matter if you stopped at the light/sign completely.  but if you front tires are ahead of the white line before the light turns red, you can proceed through the intersection.  <br>  <br>  just a little intersection knowledge.<br>  <br>  he didn't have to ticket you, and it doesn't matter the offense, there is no standard for first time offenders...that just shows you the amount of compassion the cop has.  but if you didn't come to a complete stop, you probably won't win.|`|v8INGQ6taa	you do deserve it if you ran a stop sign|`|9FkARMlzaa	First thing to check is if the fine is for the correct amount. Ring the telephone number as instructed on the ticket and ask them what the fine is for the traffic offence (also detailed on yout ticket). If the amount of the fine is incorrect the authorities may be obliged to cancel the fine altogether.<br>  <br>  If you can't get the fine canceled, you need to decide which is more affordable - (a) simply paying the fine or (b) appearing in court.<br>  <br>  If you decide on (b) you might consider asking a number of different people to swear to your good character. Perhaps the judge will let you off for this first offence. Keep in mind the policeman is charging you with a traffic offence and not a criminal offence. It seems unlikely to me that 1 traffic offence would interfere with your insurance arrangement.|`|GL240ih0aa	Write "Accepted For Full Value" on the ticket and send it in to the courts within 3 days of when you received it. Go down to the county clerks office then and ask for 1. the name of the law you broke (i dont know the name exactly, check with the clerk) and 2. the law that gives the judge power to pass judgment over you. Both of those have to be on "bond" paper. Sign both of those documents and write "Accepted For Full Value" at the bottom of each. Now when you go into the court room, before you pass the wooden barrier, ask the judge if you can enter the court under "special appearance". He has to say "yes" and if he doesn't, ask until he does. When you enter, go give him your documents on bond paper and ask him "do you have any power to proceed". he will say "no" because he doesn't and your charges will have be dropped. <br>  Yea, I know you don't believe me. But I know something people don't. Put Simply. The courts system we run under now is playing by football rules, while the general public believes they're playing by basketball rules.|`|ZNe6B9TQaa	All police vehicles have video cameras in them that will have your stop sign experience on camera.  The officer will usually bring the video to Court and you can view it before your hearing starts and determine whether or not it will be used as evidence in the hearing.  <br>  <br>  Sadly for you, I believe that in all states stopping at a stop sign requires that the vehicle come to a complete stop (some have rules about seconds) with your mph at zero.  Be sure to read up on your state's law before you go to Court!<br>  <br>  You can also check up on whether or not there are ways to get a ticket off of your record in your state (TX has tons of options), and if there is ANY flaw in your ticket--i.e. misinformation or misspellings--it is invalid and you can turn it into the court office to have it reviewed where it will then be deemed illegible.|`|m76Pfc80aa	Go to court and explain your side of the story to the judge. It's not hard. I've had tickets thrown out before. Sometimes the cop doesn't even show up (I'm not sure, but I think they sometimes have to go to traffic court on their off time). And don't worry about your insurance untel you go to court; it's not on your record until you're found guilty.<br>  <br>  Common sense applies:<br>  * Be polite<br>  * Dress nice<br>  * DO try and leave the kid with a friend or someone. last thing you need is a baby frazzeling your nerves.<br>  * Bring a statement from the DMV about your clean record (in court paperwork is like gold)|`|oMVSKGKbaa	Police routinely look for frantic mothers who are paying more attention to their kid than driving. They love to give tickets out to people who completely stop at stop signs, drive just under the speed limit and signal to make lane changes. YEA RIGHT you even told the cop "i'm sorry my baby is screaming i guess i wasn't paying attention". YOU RAN THE STOP SIGN!!!!! get over it, it happens, be more careful next time pay the fine and no your insurance will not go up. You can sometimes attend defensive driving and not even have it on your record.

That total is $500,000.  You can give the SGLI to anyone you want to, your parents, your siblings, you can have some of it put into a trust fund for your children, etc.  The $100,000 check will go directly to your Primary Next of Kin, which will be your wife.  I just wanted to clear that up because you're getting a lot of weird information about that.<br>  <br>  We also have a secondary life insurance policy that is for $800,000 and we pay $35 a for it.  We did this because my husbands SGLI is set up to where his parents get a quarter, I get half, and our kids get a quarter in a trust fund.  We didn't feel like it was enough for me and the kids, and he wanted to give his parents some money if something happens to him.<br>  <br>  Anyway as far as talking to her about it, just be upfront and honest with her.

But it involves retaining an attorney and filing a suit in the foreign state establishing the judgment under the laws of the other state and then she must proceed to collect under that state's laws.  Effectiveness of foreign enforcement varies widely.  Except in Canada, Australia, NZ,  the UK & some north European countries, collection in Europe is very difficult; & in most of the rest of the world nearly impossible. Moreover, if you think US lawyers are expensive, wait until you see how expensive they are in other countries.  So unless there's a LOT of $$ involved, it is generally not worth the attempt.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	Amendment 11 of the Constitution specifically states that the US courts do not address suits against foreign citizens.

You will only be concerned with an attorney in the U.S., it will be pricey but your attorney fees can be included in a settlement if you seek damages.

The processing fees for these are absorbed by the service that the member belongs to.  Most military members don't qualify for this and what they are suggesting is that you get a civilian passport which you would have to pay for yourself.  That is not a bad thing in this day and age since you can't even go to Canada or Mexico on vacation now without a passport or take a cruise to the Caribbean.   There were times when I would use my civilian passport when traveling through certain countries instead of my military passport even though I was traveling on official government business.  Military passports clearly identify you as a member of the US military and that can be a bad thing in some places when you are wanting to keep a low profile.  A civilian passport requires a birth certificate with a raised seal and is about $75.00.  You can ask for one to be expedited and that about doubles the fee and you can get that in about forty-five days.|`|9I3wHIdraa	Only if it is a requirement for the Navy mission.

I presume that you are applying for your relative (wife?) and you have stated that she lives with you in MD. The USICS office in MD is located in Baltimore. Therefore in question # 22 you would fill in Baltimore, MD.  It is so they know where to schedule the adjustment of status interview.  If for example you were applying for your sister who lived in Germany, she would not be eligible for adjustment of status as she is outside the USA, In that case you would fill in her local consular post.

How difficult it would be would depend on which state they're in and what kind of gun they want.<br>  <br>  For example, if they lived in California they'd need a handgun permit to buy a handgun, and that would involve a security check.

otYOxmnuaa	"Conservatives" in office, also known as Republicans, turned more liberal by mimicking their spending and increasing the size of government.  Real conservatives are pissed at Republicans for losing their way.  We got a taste of the party during the "stimulus" vote but they went right back to their ways on the stimulus bill by cramming a bunch of earmarks in it in a time when we can't afford them.  <br>  <br>  The war was unpopular and G-dubs' speeches failed to motivate and encourage the populace.  He was actually quite embarrassing at times to be the face/mind representing the U.S..<br>  <br>  That being said, people saw a lot of G-dubs' economic policy favoring the rich at the expense of the middle/lower classes (which isn't true) and made a lot of people upset.  <br>  <br>  So hatred for the Republicans helped Obama get elected -- he ran on "change" and "hope" and has been bringing both strongly:<br>  <br>  Change -- as in the rattle in your pocket when inflation kicks in and your purchasing power is diminished -- most likely devastating the very people who elected him, poor/middle classes.  (Cap and Trade/Farm Subsidies, Stimulus, Housing Bill, Omnibus -- all of which CBO said will do more harm in the long run.  www.cbo.gov).  <br>  <br>  Hope -- as in we hope the opposition is strong enough to stifle the Demos move to nationalizing damn near everything w/in the 4 years Obama will be president.  Once we do that -- anyone trying to repeal the policies will be called a racist and only looking out for the rich.  It's the ol' foot in the door...and we don't have the money to pay for it.<br>  <br>  And yes -- many libs operate on emotion and can't stand up the simple question "Why?"<br>  <br>  However, that doesn't include all libs -- there are some very smart ones out there that have very logical explanations backed by concrete historical facts.  My best friend is formally educated and very leftist -- we have some great and civil debates.<br>  <br>  Just as some Republicans cling to Guns and Religion -- there are millions who are highly educated and logical in their requests/hopes/dreams.|`|oojO4WAraa	Nope.   The democrats won this election because the religious right has ruined the republican party.  The Republican party has lost its way - acting like abortion is the biggest problem facing this country, that and getting creation taught in schools.  The Democrats also won because Bush was such a bad president.  <br>  <br>  I think both sides use emotional arguments.  If they are arguing - it is emotional.  If they were discussing instead of arguing - something might get done.|`|JCxE0mq9aa	Liberals talk driven by emotions and not facts. That is really dumb.<br>  The self-ascribed Conservatives are fool hardy cut-throat dumb-wit.<br>  CNN is anti- Barack Obama look to the stream of guests who come to their shows.<br>  Wise up.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Liberals took over because we are the majority of Americans.|`|NDMesTasaa	They took over because we didn't fight hard enough.  We should have gotten Bin Laden.  We should not have disbanded the Iraqi Army.  The tax breaks geared to the upper class, who refuse to trickle, were a mistake.  And too many closet homosexuals creating republican gay scandals, ultimately tarnished the image of the party.  There needs to be young loud talking conservatives, who are truly what they say they are, to bring back the Right.|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	no, Republicans don't seem to be the timid type, they speak their mind without restraint. The democrats took over for one reason and one reason only, GWB. His actions outraged the democrats and 1/2 the Republicans. He cost the party congressional seats and the whitehouse.<br>  BTW: 9 years ago I was a Republican and proud of it. Although I supported McCain in the 2000 primaries and voted against Bush. I know for me it was GWB that me ashamed to be a Republican because he did not represent the core values of the party. Also, I didn't vote for McCain this time because the McCain of 2000 was not the same man as McCain in 2008.|`|e2facf0a453208536391b6d4d3f72b15aa	You are saying that Christians are factual, while liberals are run by emotion?? We are not blowing up abortion clinics because of our beliefs.  And saying Christians are afraid to speak out is about the biggest load of garbage I have seen here today. Not to mention you assume that liberals are not Christian, you are brainwashed, must be all that Fox.|`|UcizgK8maa	Because Bush and the republicans acted like Democrats when they had the White House and the Congress. They lied, cheated and stole from the American people. Bush also turned into a liberal in his fiscal and social policies. That's why I say that it makes no difference who has the White house because the two parties are two wings of the same bird that is pooping on all Americans. Nether party is protecting our language, culture and borders. With BHO, we have finally turned on the the highway and are traveling at full speed to the final destination of socialism.|`|Vgk8VnXwaa	V  It's been years since any abortion clinic has been blown up and even then there is only one instance that I remember.  But libs are always demonstrating ( an adult temper tantrum) at things like the G-10 meetings, Iraq war demonstrations, etc. where they frequently are smashing storefronts and sparking riots.  Libs are emotional and rarely can they back up their positions with facts.|`|PtHThRoNaa	Christian conservatives don't speak out?  Where are you living?<br>  Far right wing radical Christians are what is driving the Republican party.  As they like to call it their base.<br>  I hope you are not saying that only Republicans are Christians?|`|iS5EbUAjaa	You seem to have Liberalism pretty well pegged. They are all for diversity and open dialog as long as you agree with them.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	I agree with your assessment in part.  <br>  <br>  Another reason is that conservatives and Republicans were somewhat divided. <br>  <br>  Moreover, many conservatives and Republicans were apathetic in this campaign, and a larger number than usual did not vote.<br>  <br>  In addition, too many conservatives and republicans wanted to buy into Obama's phony message of hope and change regarding politics as usual.  <br>  <br>  Because Obama had no long track record to judge by, it was easier to believe his lies. <br>  <br>  Lastly the Democratic campaign was far more organized then the Republican campaign in this election.  <br>  <br>  The democrats also used the internet more than did the Republicans. <br>  <br>  The Democrats also gave cigarettes and soda to the homeless to encourage them to vote, as well as bussed the homeless, elderly and disabled people to the polls. <br>  <br>  And don't forget, too, that ACORN committed voter fraud in which people were registered to vote multiple times. And the Democrats also allowed the dead to vote. <br>  <br>  With hope, the Republicans will learn their lesson and change their campaign strategy in the next election.   All they need do is pick up some of the tactics of the Democrats, with the exception of voter fraud.  <br>  <br>  Lastly, with hope the conservatives will realize that the republicans are closer to the conservative ideology than are the Democrats.|`|Wt01utSbaa	No... But Wow! How many unfounded stereotypes can you fit into 1 question?<br>  <br>  Ironic considering you claim to use facts, but just spewed a whole list of emotion.<br>  <br>  Ironic.|`|NFHeDrrPaa	I agree with you entirely except I think that Republicans are too addicted to oil and nonchalant about environmental issues.|`|m5J36D28aa	Conservatives can't run on facts because they don't support the conservative's premise.|`|1oj4aamaaa	Like many conservatives, your statement shows that you see everything in black and white, with no shades of gray.
ys7de75Vaa	The consular officer will probably just ask you to confirm the information you wrote on the various government forms.

Or the microphone clearly shows the "Shure" logo on the side. <br>  It is no more trying to promote or advertise than watching a news story and seeing that same BMW drive by in the shot.|`|GSJ9gqVWaa	It's fine.  You are allowed to show a car, so long as you don't make a big thing about it's brand name (which is a trade mark) such as BMW.|`|VTuSPl9Daa	I think you'd be okay as long as you are careful not to show any identifying features of the car, not just the BMW logo, but anything else that might scream "BMW."<br>  <br>  Hopefully an expert will step in, someone in law school or otherwise, but there are probably other sites that will be more helpful. If you google copyright law, for instance, you might find some really resourceful links. There might be a lot of words to read through, but the answer would be there, and it would probably be more definitive than a polling of yahoo answers...

Many years a ago they had a name for such people  fifth columnists , and were shot , would that we could return to them days.

Find new friends|`|B7qO5CsYaa	Hell|`|2b7VqUXXaa	That’s a good question. I would tend to assume that he was conceived in the US because his mother was from Kansas, and met his father in the US. Now, from what records remain, (those his lawyers didn’t destroy) we know that his mother traveled to Kenya prior to his birth. The controversy here is that she was in the later stages of pregnancy when she supposedly flew back to Hawaii before he was born. Even in the 60’s women in their third trimester weren’t allowed to fly. It’s very suspicious because she shouldn’t have been able to fly pregnant, and Obama’s Paternal Grandmother claims she was present for his birth in Kenya prior to his mother flying home. I’m not a conspiracy nut, but it’s just weird that Obama wouldn’t release his birth certificate, not a “Certificate of Birth” which only says that Hawaii’s pretty sure he was born (somewhere) but an actual birth certificate that shows when and where (the hospital) he was born.|`|mbgBFjKOaa	Hawaii.<br>  <br>  So there, happy?<br>  <br>  And by the way, for there to be an antichrist, people have to poof up to heaven first.

There is no international legislative body.<br>  <br>  International Law is built up of widely accepted notions combined with treaties.  Enforcement is by treaty and force of arms.  Many countries have come to agree that certain behaviors are unacceptable, but enforcement becomes political and usually doesn't happen until after defeat in a military operation.|`|27vNdc4baa	Actually studying Public International Law this year! Tough Subject gotta tell ya!!<br>  <br>  Unfortunately there is no international legislative that makes law. This means that there is no way to enforce laws on every country by one central law enforcement body. The reason for this is because states run themselves and don't want to be told what to do.<br>  <br>  There are exceptions of course. If you country is a member of the UN, and they have signed and ratified a treaty, they will have to abide by what the treaty says. Also, the Security council may make an order if there is a "threat to international peace and security" in which they authorize the use of force.<br>  <br>  So what law would you want to get passed?

If you want really basic knowledge, then news stations like five live can be good, but they do not go into enough depth on stories for me.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Get outside of Yahoo and do some research...preferably basic research, not partisan, and go from there.|`|hy45DHxgaa	Get a Poli-Sci Degree!<br>  Study Econ. & Business.<br>  Get a LAW Degree & Pass The Bar Exam.<br>  <br>  While I was in College~<br>  I was elected & involved in Student Govt.!<br>  <br>  Do all of the above~<br>  & lay a Firm Foundation for your Future.<br>  Always Hunger for Genuine Knowledge.<br>  Be Open-Minded & READ a LOT!<br>  <br>  Does the above make any sense to you?<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1CCeJ6pgaa	i would do my own research if i were you. you cant believe half of the things that are posted in yahoo answers. trust me. i wouldn't believe everything i heard in college either, they tend to be very liberally biased. just research for yourself and dont allow yourself to be swayed by emotion, only the facts.|`|2b3ihDVuaa	The libraries are full of books on political science!|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	Is your user name supposed to be funny?|`|xocIN0scaa	start watching the news .. read papers.. look on internet.. just get all sides not just left or right.

ftELrRJraa	This incident took place July 26, 2001.  Information is available on the ODMP.org web site, search by state, (Ca.) then by county. This site is dedicated to the slain officers, not the offender.
AA11206283	Why would they give you their tax records?<br>  <br>  Loan agreement. Articles of incorporation from the state if you  can get a copy.<br>  <br>  Everything else is on them to provide.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Their business records will only be relevant if the written loan agreement expressly states that the money was for a loan for that business and you would be paid back from the proceeds of that business in such-n-such a time period.<br>  <br>  What does the written agreement say?  Who signed the agreement?  Is he the sole owner?  Many times nightclubs are owned by a corporation or partnership.  You might not be able to get the records.
zMKyNcHWaa	With California broke they're probably not investigating the health plan crooks or any other scama for that matter.  It takes a lot of resources to get the evidence together.<br>  <br>  Maybe if the state went on TV and asked anyone with records of intentional delays and underpayments, etc, etc, to send them to a certain place, the public would gather the evidence for them!!!|`|T864ejaiaa	they're worried about paying health care for the illegals.
WyCmQBuvaa	Every single case that I know of, either in the papers or someone I know - lots of domestic violence "mistakes - the outcome is always the same.<br>  <br>  Once the incident is reported and they are "in the system", the state takes over and she can't drop the charges.  The victim is usually traumatized or fears retribution and gets pressured into dropping the charges.  <br>  <br>  He will have to face the charge of assault.  The state is going to have the hospital records and all the information that the 19 year old said to the police when he turned himself in.    What did he say when he turned himself in????    It must have been incriminating because they charged him with assault and now is facing jail time.  You have to look at what he said to the police and what is on the reports.  You have to look at what the girl said to the hospital staff/doctors/admissions.<br>  <br>  Was the stab wound life threatening?  If he didn't call the ambulance, would she have died?  Why did he call the ambulance after stabbing her?  Doesn't make any sense.|`|e2facf0a453208536391b6d4d3f72b15aa	In most states charges will be pressed by the state itself, not the victim.  Good luck with that, chances are the courts will not care, especially if there is any history at all. He would go to jail.|`|AA11206283	Fictionally, she can just tell thje police she can't identify the attacker, or she refuses to press charges.<br>  <br>  Not always the case in real life in every jurisdiction.|`|dCewrtXaaa	In felony cases, prosecution is not at the discretion of the victim but of the DA, so there is nothing she could do. If he turned himself in, which wouldn't make sense anyway since he could have called the ambulance and then disappeared, chances are he would also have made self-incriminating statements that would lead to charges being filed. Better develop a different plot line.

Get a damn job and stop looking for a handout.<br>  <br>  There is no, I repeat, NO damage done here. Every little kid is scared of needles. You can fight the insurance company on the emergency-room payment, but you have no standing to win any sort of a lawsuit in this case.<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|ac89nvFgaa	for the blood sample if the same nurse 'pricked' him 10 times then yes you can sue.|`|AA11716013	Did they prick him 10 times because they could not find the vein? If that was the case, then you probably can not sue. A lot of children are terrified of needles. They hurt! I'm sure the Phlebotomist didn't enjoy poking your son. <br>  <br>  If they dropped the blood, I am sure it was an accident. Accidents happen. Even in hospitals. In a perfect world, none would ever happen in a hospital, but we are all human and we all make mistakes. <br>  <br>  About your insurance, I work for a major insurance company as a claims processor.  If they denied your claim, you need to call your insurance company. they will work with you. If you have HMO and went to the ER, then your bill HAS to be paid. It is the law. Call them and explain why you took your son to the ER. I don't know who your insurance is, but I work for blue cross blue shield and if you have any questions, you can email me.|`|AA11424005	You don't have a case.  The child is so young, he will forget the events.  <br>  You have a better chance of making the insurance company pay up.  If you are in the US, file a complaint with your state's Insurance Department.|`|T864ejaiaa	the child will not forget. i never did. i hate needles to this day. talk to a lawyer.|`|ANcCxdEfaa	He's 2, it can't possibly be easy to get blood samples from someone that young unless they are ultra brave.  However, it's unlikely that he's traumatized since he's so young.  Suing and dragging his experience through the courts is a sure-fire way to get that memory to stick though so think about it, was he traumatized or were you?|`|WyCmQBuvaa	I don't know where you live, but this wouldn't happen where I live.<br>  <br>  Pneumonia is fluid in the lungs.  Why would they need a blood test to diagnose that?  Poking, prodding and dropping blood?  What kind of hospital is this?  Then to find out before you even left that the insurance company denied your claim????? Preposterous!!|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	No.  You cannot sue.   It's hard to get a blood sample form a child.  Did you go to a children's hospital or the closest ER?  Children's hospitals are better at getting blood out of such small veins.  If you did not go to a children's hospital they will blame you.<br>  <br>  Do you have a ER co-pay?|`|NW1PfiVIaa	Suck it up the kid will forget. He is only 2.

0gNlwcaVaa	Every illegal immigrant is a criminal because entry into a country illegally is, well er illegal.<br>  <br>  The government has also committed a crime in allowing it to happen just because they wanted  cheap labour.<br>  <br>  It has backfired on the government and that is why it is difficult to get full information about this invasion of criminals|`|FpioJ7F5aa	The answer has to be a guess because the illegal aliens who go to jail are offered, as we all are, the option to identify the group they are from.  Illegal aliens were told by the Hispanic Legal Groups to tell the authorities they were 'white', and those illegal aliens were recorded as such at that point, and that wasn't changed.

During the 1940s, the United States accepted a million immigrants; almost three times more came from Canada (172,000) than from Mexico (60,000). Many Mexicans moved to the United States illegally and, in the notorious 1954 "Operation *******," more than a million were returned, including some children who were U.S.-born and thus U.S. citizens.<br>  <br>  Fourth-wave immigrants began arriving in the United States after 1965, when the preference system changed. Instead of giving priority to immigrants from western Europe, the new system favored people whose U.S. relatives would sponsor them and those with skills in demand by U.S. employers. These changes in U.S. priorities, as well as prosperity in Europe and strong ties to Mexico established during the Bracero program (see Box 2), shifted the predominant origin of U.S. immigrants from Europe to Latin America and Asia.<br>  <br>  There are many similarities between immigration at the beginning of the 20th century and the start of the 21st. The number of immigrants arriving annually-more than 1 million-is about the same, although the foreign-born accounted for more of the U.S. population in 1900 (15 percent) than in 2005 (12 percent). During both periods, the economy was undergoing fundamental restructuring, from services to information at the start of the 21st century, and from agriculture to industry in the early years of the 20th. Both waves brought people from countries that had not previously sent large numbers of immigrants, raising questions about language, religion, and culture and prompting a reassessment of immigration policies.<br>  <br>  U.S. Immigration Policies<br>  <br>  Immigration policies aim to determine how many, from where, and in what status newcomers arrive. U.S. immigration policies have gone through three major phases: laissez-faire, qualitative restrictions, and quantitative restrictions.<br>  <br>   1780-1875

You're probably getting flooded with cortisol and other stress hormones every time you run.<br>  <br>  Your wind will come with - guess what - running.  Your leg strength you can help along with some weight training.  <br>  <br>  If you're serious about getting in shape, I'd look for a Crossfit gym nearby.

Once you have over come that you start to increase your speed. <br>  ALWAYS STRETCH BEFORE RUNNING, this may make your legs feel better when you run and then stretch after you run.

ade3d3f3ca191c9247976e755ae8c508aa	You wrote, "...5 years in wheat n paddy crops..." We don't need any farmers and, if you are referring to rice, Canada doesn't grow any. Our climate is too cold for that.<br>  <br>  As for you wanting to move to Canada it is not easy. You need to qualify to immigrate and Yahoo! Answers isn't really the place to find out. Check <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.cic.gc.ca</a> and read through the whole site VERY CAREFULLY. There you will discover,<br>  1. it takes a long time to immigrate to Canada<br>  2. there are nearly 1 million other applicants ahead of you and, as we only accept about 250,000 new qualified immigrants each year you can see roughly how long the whole process will take<br>  3. unless you have a job offer from a company, your chances of being able to come over are severely reduced<br>  <br>  You asked, "...does it seems fair to the civilized world to discriminate us by denying the chance of survival.?" Nobody is denying you anything or discriminating against you; Canada, like every other nation on the world, is undergoing a severe and worsening economic recession. That means that what few jobs there are out there will go to qualified Canadian citizens, not immigrants. That is the way it is everywhere else - nobody is discriminating against you so you'd be best to stop assuming that. You are one of many many others who want a better life for one's family but who also seem to believe that Canada is a free land of plenty. Be assured it is not. We are having a tough enough time finding work for our own people to then have to worry about immigrants.<br>  <br>  My advice? STAY PUT at least for now. When the economy improves, whenever that may be, revisit your idea. It is not that you or your family would not be welcome, despite your assertion. It is just that now is just not the right time. Stop assuming that anyone who says 'no' to you is discriminating against you. It's that kind of stuff that makes a lot of people want to close the doors to any and all immigration and that would be a bad thing!|`|HQKuzxulaa	A Pakistani citizen wouldn't say " plz. ".

bkav003oaa	Most middle class and poor people have grown accustomed to spending any extra cash on valueless items like DVD's or trinkets.<br>  <br>  My family was poor for years and they still have that mentality. They use any excess income for escapist products or vacations, saving little and investing less. <br>  <br>  The stress generated by low income leads to such purchasing decisions, whereas those who are wealthy are more inclined to think about where their money is going and search for better deals on consumer products and trips. <br>  However the poor families purchases in a year add up to very little - at most a few thousand dollars, whereas a wealthy individual can blow that on a few articles of clothing in a day.<br>  <br>  But to answer your second question, most wealthy people depend on the much larger middle and poor classes for their income. So even though the poor spend less per year on consumer products there are so many poor people that the aggregate total is much larger that the wealthy classes expenditures in a year. <br>  <br>  To answer your second question, keeping poor and middle class people employed and with some disposable income is far more important than keeping the rich prosperous. <br>  <br>  If a wealthy person loses a portion of income they will simply slip into the middle class, if a middle class person loses a portion of income, then they slip into poverty and contribute little to the nation's financial health.|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	The keyword there is "disposable."<br>  <br>  By far the middle-class has been programmed to spend more than they can afford on consumer goods and this has had an overall negative affect on the economy.<br>  <br>  1) Consumer goods retain little or no value, so they are not "investments."  Therfore, net-worth goes down while spending increases.<br>  <br>  2) MIddle class consumers are more price-sensitive than the wealthy, therefore they will support the "lowest price" philosophy that has made Walmart king and sent American Manufacturing to China.<br>  <br>  3) I'd say that this mentality has hurt "job creation" and has only supported "retention" by creating a new class of serial debtors who are slaves to their monthly payments.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Disposable shouldn't really be in that question.<br>  <br>  The poor spend 100% of their paychecks, realistically they probably spend more like 120%, on bills, food, clothing and a little entertainment.<br>  <br>  Most of the middle class spends most of their income on those things too.  It probably ranges from about 85% - 100%.<br>  <br>  The wealthy spend between 20% - 60% of their income and save and invest the rest.<br>  <br>  This question is exactly why the "fair" tax is a terrible idea.

The foundation of our economic structure has been undermined over many years. Some would suggest this started in the Reagan years when he created the largest debt in American history, up until that time. Of course, since then, President Bush (43) oversaw the largest debt. Consequently, it's unrealistic to expect for the structures of the economy to be fixed in days, weeks, or even a few months.

You will also learn that the election marked an acute point of heightened divisiveness between the two parties, exacerbated by (among many other things) the Supreme Court intervening in the Florida recount, Republicans overt despising of the 42nd President, the relatively recent revelations of Clinton's "Monica meanderings", Newt Gingrich's "scorched Earth" strategy of non-consensus building and his failed "Contract with America," and the small additional fact that Gore won the popular vote by around 500,000 votes.<br>  <br>  It was known before Bush was elected that he was like a turtle on a fencepost. There is no logical reason for him getting there other than being placed. Now we have 8 years of proof of his incompetence. It is simply disingenuous and fatuous to try to draw a comparison between these two, not to mention petty and short-sighted.<br>  <br>  Republicans are in a state of change to put it kindly.

They wanted those wars lost and they didn't care about our troops or the Iraqi's when our troops were yanked out or anyone else. They didn't care about anything but their own selfish agenda's. Now they've got the messiah they wanted and the rest of us get to watch him hand this country over to the Chinese, the Russians, and the Arabs. <br>  <br>  At least we know who is responsible for and deserving of the Communism this South Chicago gang-banger in suit is bringing on us.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	The liberals live in La La land. <br>  <br>  Facts don't mean anything to the liberals.

AA10895669	There is nothing "Wrong" with being liberal, But there is a lot wrong with instituting many of the popular liberal concepts and social conditions mostly because they are anti growth, anti motivational and anti life.<br>  <br>  The concept of being a liberal is a wonderful idea, it allows you to think outside the box and consider more options then the traditional. But unfortunately human nature takes advantage of all those wonderful ideas. For example. We want to live in a crime free environment a liber says we need to "understand" and we need to "help" and protect the criminial. It says if we are just more compassionate for the perpetrator then will reduce the numbers of victims.<br>  <br>   If we attempt to make up for the wrongs of the past by making exceptions for those with only a connection to that past and not a reality in it, then we create an expectation for reparations or compensation even though no person in this day was responcible for the wrongs of the past.<br>  <br>   If we place restrictions and inhibit what we do on this world due to an unproven and propagandized phenomenon, we are actually over looking the realities of "proper stewardship" and aggrandize the emotional ploys and profit margins of those who will take advantage. While causing more and more unemployment lines and doing nothing to confront the contamination of a healthy environment that will sustain our life form.<br>  <br>  The Conservative, contrary to all the stereotypes cares about all of these things as well. We just don't agree on the way you solve them. <br>  <br>  For example. Instead of fearing a gun in every house we educate the public and give people skills with an understanding as to how to use and respect them. This will prevent more crime then being nice to the bad guys. Basically criminals can pick out victims a lot better and easier then a victim can pick out criminals. Putting a little more options in peoples hands by teaching awarness and control in favor of just treating the criminal with more rights will deter most any crime.<br>  <br>  We believe that each individual is responcible (provide they have the mental and physical ability to do so) for their own happiness and well being. To provide for those who can provide for themselves by an overt government is basically legal theft let alone anti constitutional.<br>  <br>  And then of course there is the abortion divisions. Inherently life is more important than rights, No person can with out regret remorse or hardship decide on what that life is or should be even for a potential life. So this  becomes a sticky situation and where I feel (my personal opinion) A law prohibiting does interefear with a womans right to her body. But, the other edge of that sword says we are not a society that is pro active in a preventitive way, (no of course this will not deal with 100% of all abortions) but it will certainly reduce the numbers, if were to go back to a society that frowns on casual sex, taught abstance in a serious way, and forced people to be more responcible for their actions. Such as making it diffecult to get help without disclosure of the fathers name, or taking the insentives away from having more children, if you can not provide for that child own your own.<br>  <br>  Basically a liberal ideology has little no consequences for actions that can be disruptive or negitive to a society structure. A conservative ideology always lifts up a society to exceed it's own standards.<br>  <br>   As a conservative, I and my friends do not care who or what a person is, we care about what that person does for themselves, for their neighbors, and for their country. We used to be a nation of doers, we could sermount any task or hardship. Now we seem to only turn to the government or are forced to turn to the governmen, if we aren't provided with the right number of bath rooms. This isn't the American dream.<br>  <br>   Liberalism if left to it's extreem would provide for people that can provide for themselves. <br>  <br>   Conservatisim allows a person and expects a person to provide for themselves.|`|ERVib5gYaa	Liberalism is for political and social change, conservatives are traditional. There is no right or wrong, it's just one's belief on what is best for a country. Making a country completely liberal is wrong as it doesn't pay attention to conservative wants, and vice versa. Everyone can live in country without it being liberal or conservative... That said, we would need to lose central government.|`|98EXXItdaa	If that's all you ever care about, you'll be a liberal forever.<br>  <br>  When you start caring about your family and neighbors and country.. that's when you start diverging from liberal ideals.|`|RDQittNDaa	Because pro-business conservatives don't want to be environmentally friendly because it will cost them more money.

The economy has taken plenty of its toll on me, I've had enough happen to know why I chose to vote as a liberal this time. I can see myself as a conservative in some ways, but not right now. Being a liberal has hardly anything to do with tree-hugging, hemp-bracelet-making stuff. It's about what you want for your country. If a clean environment is part of it, fine, but that's not all of it. If the environment is all you care about, that doesn't make you liberal. It makes you a hippie.<br>  <br>  Geraldine: Agreed.|`|AcWMpmPwaa	we conservatives are not saying it's wrong...just don't hide behind word attachments like...progressive, fiscal conservative/socially liberal or any other fake curtain statements. and what makes you anymore special caring about the environment or the like, do you think that being conservative this doesn't concern us too. i happen to like clean water to drink also my friend. and i love wild animals, i just happen to like them on my table more than you guys. try not to paint us as enemies of the environment because we're not, it makes absolute sense to utilize our God given resources.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	Obama has targeted non-profit organizations like your father's for extermination with his proposal to eliminate charitible deductions.  There is no room in the socialist workers paradise for non-profits.  They compete with an all-powerful government.  Perhaps when your father loses his job you will start to get the idea that liberalism has nothing to do with the environment; it is about government control of your life.  You could also travel around the world and take a look at the state of the environment in Marxist countries like the one Obama wants to force down our throats.  Be sure to take a face mask to cover your nose and mouth.|`|reeU4N0eaa	Oh that's right.

Not partisan but we are a bit surly when you make us put up with your tears but ignored our concerns about assaults on the the constitution and why we attacked a country that did nothing to us.<br>  ADDED: you seem to forget that the CIA and the FBI are under the executive branch and all the intelligence provided to Congress was screened through the president first. We have since learned that those reports were adjusted to align with making a case for invasion.  You also seem to forget that we invaded before Congress approved articles of war (check the dates in the congressional record they are a matter of public record).

They get their party designation from whatever their parents were. Then, they don't bother to really see who the best candidate is. They choose to vote with the party. <br>  2. A lot of people are confused. They think all Republicans are right leaning. Our last 2 Republican presidents were central to left leaning. They failed in some aspects of their presidency (economics) and did not find out what VETO meant until it was to late. These actions caused a lot of people to have a bad taste in their mouth for Republicans.|`|N0iM1mo8aa	I think we're a little more centrist to just mildly right leaning if anything.

If you believe that low taxes and small government work, you probably thought the economy of those six years were excellent. Obama is not the fault of our economic problems. He can only act by issuing matters related to the law or signing ones passed by Congress.

Neighbors, friends, etc.  We are on duty 24/7.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	It depends on the situation for most.  Police officers today, though required to intervene in some fashion or another, in immediate safety issues, are also caught between two often-warring schools of thought.  On one hand, it is their job and most take it seriously.  On the other hand, police administrations often frown upon officers involving themselves in too many things, while off duty...some even while on duty, and can make life harder for the officer for doing so.  It's a shame to see, but it does happen.  Things can spiral out of control in off-duty situations, leading to failures to recognize the officer's authority, fights, and of course accusations of misconduct, which may not hold as much weight, when the officer can document having been "summoned" to the scene, instead of being involved in a neighborhood dispute.  One of the most common ways for even on-duty officers to get hurt, and into trouble, is intervening in domestic disputes.<br>  <br>  For these reasons, officers must be selective about the severity of the incidents, in which they involve themselves.   Any officer worth their salt will absolutely intervene if their neighbor is being hurt, or may be imminently hurt.  If not, of if there is a potential for harm, but there is enough time for an on-duty officer, or child protective services, or another similar agency, to be summoned, then they will likely just watch and make sure the neighbor is ok, while awaiting the appropriate response.

Unfortunately the only thing that trickles down is the crap when everything goes wrong.<br>  Much like a child stamping its feet next to an empty cookie jar, theres something you need to realise - without us horrid poor people, there will be no one to produce goods in factories, provide with services, or guard you while you sleep. If the economy is knackered, as it is on a global scale, you cant fix it unless you have the basic things that make an economy run in the first place. This means we need to get people back into work, confidence returned to the market, and to do this, we need to speculate to accumulate. You'd understand this if you were a true capitalist, rather than the product of a parent state looking to feather their own nest and screw everyone else.<br>  I know what I'm saying probably angers you, but it doesn't matter -people like you screwed our economy on a global scale, and your time is up.

Contact your local lawmakers, instead.|`|dgQ4MciGaa	Christians.<br>  <br>  Sunday "blue" laws are making a comeback.<br>  <br>  These old chestnuts, such as "No bathing on Sunday" (Pennsylvania), "No buying or selling of alcohol or tobacco on Sunday" (also PA), are being dragged out by your LOCAL christian fundys.  Unsuccesful at having their moralistic way on the national scene, they have turned their attention to local politics such as the town council, the school board, and the library committee (which selects books the library will buy and lend out).  As noted by another answerer, the movie, "Footloose", is a good example of this type law.<br>  <br>  The law in question, not allowing dancing where liquor is sold, was aimed at 'roadhouses' originally.  These establishments, most often located on the County line, were rowdy places with lots of fights, some stabbings, and the occasional shoot-out.  You know, places where people went to have fun.  (You can always spot the good ones, 'cuz they have chicken wire all across the stage where the band plays).<br>  <br>  The 'Fundys' are GOOD at this.  And you know what?  They're WINNING!<br>  <br>  Trying to get a Constitutional Amendment mandating the teaching of "Creationism" in public schools was a flop AND it brought embarrassment and ridicule down upon the pious brow of the Religious Right.  Another way had to be found.  It just HAD TO!  Jesus was counting on them, wasn't he?<br>  <br>  And lo, it came to pass, that another way Had Been Found!  Elect 'right thinking' people to the Local School Board!  Dress up 'creationism' as 'Intelligent Design' and argue that it was only 'fair' that this Alternate Theory to the Theory of Evolution be taught ALONG SIDE evolution.  Side by side.  Equal time. ID equal to ToE!<br>  <br>  It worked!  In Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, throughout the entire midwest.  Fundys were squealing in pants-wetting glee!  Until...<br>  <br>  Enough people said "Enough is E-Nuff"!  And the whole thing was shot down by the Supremes.<br>  <br>  And that brings us back to YOUR issue.  Retarded as their moralistic venue may be, these people are anything but retarded.  (Besides, the comparison is a disservice to honest, law-abiding 'retards' who came by their mental injury the natural way, through drugs, country music, and alcohol).  They know that not enough people will gather together and fight this thing, whether by ballot initiative or voting the (non) rascals out of office.  And you can forget the Supremes.  I bet not ONE of them has ever been to a 'roadhouse' (a whorehouse, sure) or ever danced to a band playing behind chicken wire.<br>  <br>  It's a sad fact:  one day we'll ALL wake up to a Blue Sunday.<br>  <br>  skep, who once<br>  saw Kevin Bacon get thrown out of a dancehall by Patrick Swayze.|`|AA11203798	Now,now, musnt mock the great democracy you know, after all all those Save sunday people,and  the ''drink is evil mob and all like sickos must be allowed to uphold the morals of society you know, meanwhile the[ll let druggies buy cheaper, invest in brewery's, and buy shares in rock bands, so they cant be too bad now can they.

And a lot of times they prefer military dependents (spouses and children) instead of straight up civilians.<br>  <br>  I think sometimes civilians get paid more, but that's when you're looking at jobs that require you to have degrees and stuff.|`|ko4cp582aa	if you want to work on the base doing like office stuff, then look on www.usajobs.com. those positions are recession-proof, but if you were married to a military servicemember you would get the job 80% easier. The military caters to it's military wives in that respect. If you want to work in hairdressing/ fast food, or in any of the sales/shopping positions on base you will have to go through AAFES, (Army Air Force Exchange Service) which provides us with our BX/PX and all of our on base restaurants. I believe that they have merged with the USMC and the NAVY so go to that website and they have jobs online there. Again, I believe that they cater to Military spouses. But I can't tell you if those jobs are recession proof or the benefits or anything. Going as a GS civilian is the best way (usajobs.com).

Appearing on a DUI charge is bad enough, but to wear a shirt with that saying is telling the judge that you think it is a funny situation and have no regard for the law.

When you warn someone, over and over, and they go right ahead and do what you warned them not to, and it blows up in their face...well...you kind of have to smile.   If not, you'll cry, considering their stupidity takes you down with them.|`|CqqYQaHOaa	The better question is why is the market down over 20% since Obama took office.

qwaWd14vaa	There is always two sides too every story. There is the side of the neighbor, who the neighborhood sees as doing good deeds for everyone, but; inside his house behind closed doors, runs a house of terror, mayhem and total abuse.(wife, children-abuse does not always have to be physical, it can also be mental cruelty)<br>  Sometimes all is well, until a wife says; "I want a divorce.", then files for it. Now the situation becomes one of, "Nobody is getting anything, I worked for all my life, to have." Then the whole family goes out as a family.<br>  Another reason is as my mother always said, "It is not nice to speak bad of the dead."<br>  FINALLY: the best rational, if s/he was killed and you (family) see a way to sue for money, are you gonna say; "He was evil, he had the devil in him, he deserved to die?"<br>  I see this one every-time some gang banger or prisoner was killed, everyone all of a sudden has a change of pace,  "He was such a nice kid, he never hurt anyone, why did they have too shoot him? ?|`|FvYqKZSMaa	There is always a crazy person out there who may be jealous but they mean all or most who knew the person.|`|nwMBfgcdaa	I think there is a saying something like "death improves people".  <br>  <br>  Everyone always says that about someone who died.  They could have been the biggest ***hole in life, but when they die, they were great.  <br>  Plus it makes it more dramatic when the lost of life is very missed.|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	because it's easier to tell that lie rather than call it like it is. the guy was a jerk and needed offed. <br>  <br>  that, or the 'nice' guy was a sociopath. they have no conscience and manipulate people. the nice guy usually gets what he wants. <br>  <br>  agree or not. i'm bored too. lol
IuJjYz6gaa	Yes you still pay taxes on that amount.  And you still get a W-2 for it every year.<br>  <br>  Edited:<br>  You won't actually get a check, it'll be direct deposited into your checking account.  And you will receive a pay stuff via mypay, it's called an LES (leave and earnings statement), it will say how much comes out for federal taxes and social security and medicare and state taxes, etc.  They will be listed under "deductions"
yTkNT3OSaa	Violent crimes involving the use of knives have been 'stable' for awhile, and are now thought to be declining (we'll have to wait for the latest statistics from the Home Office before we could say for sure). As for why there are as many as there are... well, it's just human nature. We might complain about the youths of today, but what about the mods & rockers of the 60's? Large scale rioting and fights were common; we don't have any of that anymore! Some people are always going to want to harm other people; they have since the dawn of mankind, and I can't see that changing.<br>  <br>  The real problem, is that the reasons for wanting to harm others are so petty that it's pathetic. Children are brought up with no respect for other people, and don't value human life; they see stabbing someone who 'dissed' them as the right thing to do. This attitude can only be changed by the parents, educational system and society at large. Yes the government should be doing more to make this happen, but as long as people like you sit there saying 'ban this, ban that' then they won't bother! It's quite quick and easy to draw up a new law that's only purpose is to prevent something that's already illegal, and then wave it around saying 'vote for us; we're tough on crime'... but it doesn't make any difference to the criminals.<br>  <br>  Laws don't prevent crime, they only define it. The only thing that can prevent crime is having a decent (and preferably armed) society, and that comes with good role-models (not violent rap-stars, drunk rockers or rapist footballers), parental discipline (not 'couldn't give a toss' dads leaving their children and single mum's living on benefits all their life) and a good education and/or a 'productive' hobby (not playing shoot-em-up games all day everyday).<br>  <br>  So; if you aren't happy about today's society, do your part to change it and start with yourself. Don't expect the government to tell you how to live.|`|GvgmSxdCaa	Unlike the first answerer here (who obviously has no idea and talks of absolute nonsense) ... <br>  <br>  There are TWO theories... <br>  <br>  Some say that knife crime is rising...<br>  <br>  But many others believe that knife crime is not rising and we are all victim of media hype... <br>  <br>  Knife crime can occur anywhere, i live in a small town and it just so happens we had a woman stabbed to death by a 17 year old youth just last week... <br>  <br>  However as can be expected knife crime and violent assaults are indeed more likely to occur in major cities such as Cardiff or London etc... <br>  <br>  Knife crime and almost all of the killings reported recently in the newspapers tend to be committed by ethnic groups. Predominantly most of the victims tend to be black African/Somalian males and most of the victims are indeed involved in gang/drug/gun culture. <br>  <br>  If you keep yourself to yourself and try your very best not to upset anyone then you should be fine... <br>  <br>  Just keep street wise and smart .... <br>  <br>  Use common sense it can get you a long way in such situations... <br>  <br>  Hope i have helped you with your question...|`|3oNcHdgCaa	Actually, "knife control" might be an idea worth pursuing. You can ask any professional chef, and none of them can give you a specific reason as to why kitchen knives have sharp points on them. They're just not needed. So let's come up with laws requiring kitchen knives to be manufactured with blunt tips, and it's going to be a lot harder to stab anybody.|`|r1MImdh3aa	Knife crimes are typically crimes of passion. At times like these, people start "clumping", leading to closer relations and therefore more crimes related to these relations. Why, then are knives used as opposed to guns? There's something subconsciously romantic about stabbing someone to death with a knife as opposed to shooting them.|`|AA11203798	namby pamby british politics is the cause.

Not sure if Japan has a quarantine or not, but the base vet office will know.<br>  <br>  If you live in housing, generally the limit is 2.  Not sure about how Okinawans feel about renting to pet owners.  You really ought to check with the housing office there and see what they have to say.<br>  <br>  Transportation costs are on you!  And they are not reimbursable moving expenses.  The best you can do is claim it on your taxes when you file next year.  Plan on about $1000 per animal for flights.

I was 19 when I got in trouble with the po po. I was a working, good student, never vandalized 19 year old and the quote on quote "justice system" penalized me for having 3 grams of shwag. Tell me that ain't some ****. All I'm ranting on about is that getting stoned never hurt anyone except for the fact that its illegal and you can get in trouble for smoking it or even having it. THC is something that GOD put on the planet so it's natural right? I think its great for medical purposes but it lacks culture behind. Know what I mean? Like indians smoked peace pipes but not like chain smokers, so cigarettes become a problem. Moderation could be the way for everything if there were meaning behind things. Anyways, I don't know where I'm going with this...I say let the stoners smoke and sink money into things that matter instead of politician's pockets.|`|yb01tlviaa	I agree, it should be legalized, although I think their theory is that if they legalize it, alot more kids will be trying it because its no longer illegal, and once it becomes decriminalized there will be a lot more kids smoking.  Which I have no problem with haha, but i think non smokers do. boo on non-smokers! :P|`|6WQo6RpSaa	I don't smoke it myself, but sometimes I wonder if it might be a good idea to legalize it...because if they legalized it they could tax it and make a bunch of money off it :D|`|AosW4IvHaa	Oh if they "Legalize" it, The Revenue goes down.

You Democrats whine about deficit spending complaining about how bad it is during the Reagan and both Bush administrations and yet now for some reason because the Democrats have the white house and both houses trillion dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see are ok?! In less than two months Obama has spent almost $2 trillion in deficit spending! The federal budget for one year is $1 trillion dollars so he has spent the entire federal budget for the next two years! His budget have $600 billion in new spending in it.<br>  <br>  While he was campaigning he said that he would stop pork barrel spending and ear marks yet he signed a so called stimulus package that was mostly pork and earmarks and had very little to do with stimulus. There is a spending bill going through the house right now that has between 4000 and 9000 pork and ear mark projects in it which Obama has said he would sign!<br>  <br>  He said that he would have an ethical administration. Yet we now have a serial tax cheat in charge of the IRS who didn't know that he could not deduct his kids summer camp as a business expense?! One of his nominees had to drop out because he was under investigation  and three others had to drop out because it was discovered that they were tax cheats!<br>  <br>  He said that he would not allow lobbiests in his administration and held a press conference while he signed an executive order to that effect. Then before the ink was dried on the executive order he lifted it for two lobbiests to join his administration! At this point I have lost count of how many lobbiests are in his administration.<br>  <br>  So far his economic policies have caused the stock market to drop more than 3000 points since his election and every time he gives a speech it drops another 200 to 300 points.<br>  <br>  You Democrats constantly whine about tax cuts to the rich yet right now Obama and his party are giving welfare to the rich which I have to help pay for!

Their facial image and fingerprints are taken to securely lock them to one identity and help businesses crack down on illegal working.<br>  <br>  Later this week stringent new rules to bring in workers to the United Kingdom through Tiers 2 and 5 of the points system will also begin.<br>  <br>  Identity cards will be mandatory for all foreign nationals and provide a simple secure means of proving a foreign national's right to work to businesses. Companies will have to keep records of the migrants they have sponsored - including their contact details and a copy of their identity card.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsarticles/firstidcards" rel="nofollow">http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecon...</a>|`|BiZp6pDCaa	What about foreign nationals wanting to enter the UK?<br>  <br>  From November 2008 they will have to apply for "biometric residence permits" or "biometric visas" and their details will be entered into the national identity database. The government also wants all foreign nationals living in the UK to have identity cards and will make anyone applying to extend their stay register biometric details, from November 2008. The aim is that 90% of foreign nationals in the UK will have ID cards by 2015. <br>  <br>  Why did Britain get rid of ID cards after World War II?<br>  <br>  During the WWII the ID card was seen as a way of protecting the nation from Nazi spies. But in 1952, Winston Churchill's government scrapped the cards. The feeling was that in peacetime they simply were not needed. In fact they were thought to be hindering the work of the police, because so many people resented being asked to produce a card to prove their identity. <br>  <br>  What are the ID card plans?<br>  <br>  Everyone over the age of 16 applying for a passport will have their details - including fingerprints and facial scans - added to a National Identity register from 2011/12. The first identity cards will be issued to non-EU foreign nationals coming to work in the UK in 2008. From 2009, about 200,000 airport workers in the UK will have to get identity cards as a condition of employment. From 2010 students will be encouraged to get ID cards when they open bank accounts. From 2011/12 the Identity and Passport Service plans to issue "significant volumes" of ID cards alongside British passports - but people will be able to opt out of having a card if they don't want one. <br>  <br>  What will happen when I apply for a passport?<br>  <br>  From 2012, you will have to go to privately-run "biometric enrolment centres" to be fingerprinted and, in some cases, interviewed, when you apply for a passport. The new Identity and Passport Service will then carry out a "background check" on you to establish that you are who you say you are. Your details will then be entered in a national database and you will be issued with a passport and given the option of having an ID card.<br>  <br>  <br>  This all sounds to me like something the Nazi's were doing during the 1930's and 1940's........<br>  <br>  No To ID Cards<br>  <a href="http://www.no2id.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.no2id.net/</a>
d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	Just like conservatives, liberals vary in their opinions on those issues- there's no rank-and-file consensus or following the marching orders of any organization, opinions are formed based upon what each individual thinks is right. Keep in mind that many people believe in liberal economic policies but may be socially moderate, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  Euthanasia:  All over the place, some feel individuals should have right to determine when & how they end their lives, others oppose allowing doctors to participate, others oppose it for religious reasons.<br>   <br>  Abortion: Most feel it's a last resort whch should remain legally available (as do many conservative women) but in both cases, some oppose it.  Most believe that medical science should make the determination of when int he developmental cycle a fetus becomes a person, not religious traditions. <br>  <br>  Almost everyone opposes partial-birth abortions (despite conservative talk show rhetoric to the contrary) but most feel that in life-threatening circumstances when doctors even consider such dire measures, that again- doctors, not legislators must decide upon what courses of action to follow.<br>  <br>  Most feel that special provisions must be made for cases of rape and incest to allow abortions, even if they are generally not allowed.  This also highlights a major problem with many parental notification laws which assume sexual abuse of girls by family members doesn't occur. <br>  <br>  Death Penalty: More opposition than support, for a variety of reasons. Some oppose it on religious or ethical grounds, others simply don't feel the state should be in the business of killing people.  The greatest opposition comes from civil rights groups and minority groups who point out that the justice system historically has NOT been color-blind throughout most of the nation's hisrtory.  The racial problems in America did not somehow bypass law enforcement and the courts- racism played a role in many criminal proceedings, especially in earlier decades before the advent of DNA testing.<br>  <br>  Even now, disproportionate numbers of African-American males are incarcerated on drug charges because of mandatory sentencing guidelines which impose much harsher penalties essentially because of race and socioeconomic status (Crack cocaine which is sold & purchased primarily in poor minority neighborhoods vs powder which is sold/used in more affluent and predominanty white neighborhoods).<br>  <br>  Many argue that this is only the tip of the iceberg, much like the Wall Street corruption.  And where people's lives are at stake, we need to go back and examine those cases rather than simply executing people whose "fair trials" may not have been so fair after all.|`|dTAQYe2daa	They believe it is okay to kill yourself, and unborn and partially born babies, but it is not okay to kill those who would kill you or the babies.|`|OiAl6w48aa	Yes across the board.

f0bb213732f5c2ceb3db8c6b3def0573aa	What is wrong with the population?  Science has increased the food supply from American farmers in such a manner to be able to keep up just fine.  Governments have taken away from that food supply by making people use corn alcohol (ethanol) to drive their cars.  Do not look to government for any solution - 99 times out of 100 their solution tends to be wrong.<br>  <br>  Some people think they need to control everything.  Everything does not need to be controlled.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	since when do you presume to decide that population needs to be controlled?<br>  <br>  don't you think this infringes on a basic human right?<br>  <br>  and if it is a basic human right, why would a democracy or republic need to control it?<br>  <br>  ***<br>  PS:  the United States is a republic, not a democracy.  you might want to discover what the difference is.
ED4nlW4raa	It is workplace harassment.<br>  <br>  Start to document this every time this happens.  (date, time, place, who,etc.)  in your mind make a game of it so you won't be so tired of it.  Enjoy the documentation.  After one month, go to HR.  Continue to monitor their comments and after another month go to HR.  Repeat as often as possible.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|dtvvEGZMaa	it sure is a form of harassment ... you should go ahead and report them for doing that.  Once you report them, make sure you let it be known that you would like something to be done about it as soon as possible or you will report it to a higher authority. That way - whoever supervises you will know that their job is on the line as well in the event that nothing is being done about it...|`|r5W4dc7zaa	I think you should call them out on it, I mean if they're getting on your nerves than speak to them first about it. If they deny every saying anything like that then go to HR and tell them about the situation. If you go to HR without speaking to them then they can't really help you out. You would have the advantage by saying that yea you did try talking to them. I hope everything works out for you :)|`|fNBGSfnAaa	it's multiple things thats against the law but you have to tell them to stop at least once and tell a supervisor which is the only way they will do anything even if they know it's wrong. that is all the information i can give you right now.|`|NH2QK1guaa	i would say it is but its going to be hard to prove it or be taken seriously. if you say something and nothing ends up happening it might just make the insults worse.|`|2vBfY2ZLaa	just beat the crap out of them|`|r1MImdh3aa	Absolutely.

It is very important to keep a log of these occurrences before approaching HR.  You might also give some thought to what you would like the end result to be.  It will help you to stay focused on your work and ultimately you will have to decide if you want to continue working there.|`|kycCzUVGaa	This is harrassment and a form of bullying, I have seen such things all my life, you don't have to take it.

HZvdr8VLaa	I would never NEVER go to court without a lawyer!  It's just a bad idea, bordering on stupid.  You will loose your driving privileges, be fined, probably have to attend alcohol counseling to get your license back and maybe you will have to install an alcohol detector in your car for a year..  it all depends on the state you are in, MANY states are getting very tough on DUI ..|`|ulzWumWPaa	In GA it will fall out like this:<br>  First offense: in jail while you sober up, $1000 fine, 400 hours community service, DUI school, suspended license for 1 year, breathalyzer device on your car for a year after you get your license back and your insurance rates through the roof for years afterward. Next time: it all doubles.|`|AA10123414	What will happen in court depends on the state where this happened. However, in general:<br>  1. You will lose your license for some time. 3 - 6 months is common.<br>  2. You will get hit by a heavy fine.<br>  3. In some states you will get a day or two in jail. If you were held over night when you were arrested this may serve that requirement.<br>  <br>  A lawyer probably won't get you off and will not likely reduce the cost however talking to one is not a bad idea.|`|ugWaptu2aa	Getting a DUI is nerve wrecking, not just from a legal perspective but also from a financial perspective as insurance rates go through the roof on DUI convictions. <br>  <br>  My suggestion to you is to not plead guilty to the charges. A DUI/DWI case can be a long and drawn out process if you contest it. Look up attorneys in your area, before you pick one at random ask for consultations. Most attorneys offer a free consult and will tell you what they can do for you and offer prices. Some (my firm does this) accept a reasonable payment plan. <br>  <br>  DUI/DWI cases are complicated, it is best to hire an attorney who is experienced in these matters.<br>  <br>  If you do this yourself, you will be given the option of speaking with the prosecutor or pleading guilty or not guilty. If you hire an attorney, your lawyer will be able to obtain all necessary documents and file motions on your behalf. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to the American Bar Association's referral page. Good luck.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.abanet.org/legalservices/lris/directory/" rel="nofollow">http://www.abanet.org/legalservices/lris...</a>|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	You have been charged with a misdemeanor, you should have a lawyer.  <br>  <br>  You can expect the judge to slap you with a couple of thousand dollars in fines and suspend your driving privileges for at least one month.  The lawyer could earn their fee here by getting a reduction in the fine.  The suspension is practically guaranteed even with a lawyer.|`|AA11631715	get a lawyer, have to mitigate the damage.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	Getting a lawyer is always a smart idea.  Most likely you will be put on probation for 1-3 years, and during that time if you are ever pulled over and blow positive on the test (even if it is below the limit) you will go to jail.|`|m45R3s5Daa	dont waste your money on a lawyer. you will be fined the same as if not having a lawyer. my friend is in california and had the same thing happen to him. he got a fine, suspended license for awhile, had to attend aa classes(had to pay each time he attended) and wasted his money on a lawyer (liar).|`|AA11203798	D U I's are deadly serious, be prepared for a long prison sentence and a very long ban, with possibly your having to re sit your driving test, you'll also have to pay court costs or get an extended sentence on top, usually consecutive.|`|BFmZq29Qaa	If you have a clean record, the ride will be easier.  If you have any marks against you the ride will be rougher.  The end result will depend upon which state and county you obtained this in, the demeanor of the citizens within it and how strong the presence of MADD is.<br>  <br>  A lot more of it will also be luck.  In any given court, there are several judges and each have a range of penalty they are allowed to impose upon you, above and beyond the requirements of their state.  If your judge had a bad day, or does not like your attitude or lawyer, you can expect to see additional fun from the final result.<br>  <br>  My advice is to get a lawyer who is active in your county/city of offenses issues of this nature.  Get a feel for whether or not he has a good reputation with the court system there.  Remember to be as submissive and polite as possible because any counteracting behavior viewed by the DA or judge will likely make you a posterchild case for that day.<br>  <br>  You can expect to take an alcohol assessment which can lead to counseling; awareness classes; MADD classes; possibly having an interlock device on your car for the next year or 2; about 1 year of probation; 30-120 hours of community service; $1500.00 in court cost and supervision fees related to any probation; possible jail time (usually not the case for first timers, unless you have a record in general); possible AA assignment; expectation to get an SR22 insurance addendum; random drug/alchol tests and so on...<br>  <br>  Just remember that the next year of your life will be very challenging.  You will likely have to change your friends and ways of life if you are into any scenes at all... otherwise you might slip on any sentencing requirements and will face more fines, court costs, possible jail time and additional restrictions.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you walk on eggshells and take this seriously.  It is best to endure the misery of the next year with a determined mind than to try and outsmart the system.
