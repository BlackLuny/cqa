20080108213041AA5LRN8	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Me Ayudan, Amigos de Guatemala?	Estamos produciendo un libro para los ni?os de Guatemala, especialmente los ni?os del area de Panajachel quienes en su mayoria son Indigenas Maya. Ya nos encontramos en las ultimas etapas de produccion y pronto se imprimira.       Este libro se repartira sin costo alguno a los ni?os de el area de Panajachel y Tierra Linda en Solola, Guatemala. Y tiene un tema de autoestima.      Como saben, el Espa?ol varia dependiendo del pais en el que se habla (Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Guatemala, etc) y queremos estar seguros de usar las palabras que estos ni?os comprenden.      Necesitamos su ayuda, amigos de Guatemala. Hay un verso en el libro que dice "era solo de color cafe"       Se nos ha sugerido que se cambie la palabra "cafe" por la palabra "marron" por ser mas internacionalmente conocida.      Necesitamos saber su opinion, cual de estos terminos es mas usado o entendido en Guatemala y principalmente por los ni?os.      De antemano les agradecemos su ayuda!   :D

Caro giovanni,   ti volevo parlare della mia città, senigallia,è una città di mare , non tanto grande è composta da circa 50 mila abitanti...ma molto confortevole...

To throw it aside,   is more than melancholy.   To love and be loved this way,   is more than love.      At a simple glance,   a glimpse of perfection,   shown by the light of love.      See through the troubled times,   and into each others eyes.   the sought perfection has been found.   Keep grasp of it,   Never let it go.      You have abandoned you fears,   and found strength in each other.   Never let that go.   You will always have truth in each other.

20090227170400AAceXye	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Is there any actor great enough to reveal Hamlet's divided soul?	Hamlet is not a cowardly, indecisive, whiny wimp, but rather a valiant soldier of the spirit, fighting a desperate internal battle for the sovereignty of his soul.       When he is not "from himself taken away," Hamlet is the rational, peace-loving Wittenberg scholar who said, "Use [the actors] after your own honor and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty."      But when he is possessed by his father's warlike spirit, he is Prince Hamlet, the soldier, who said, "Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument, but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honor's at the stake" and, "My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!"      Over the past decade and a half, I've written thousands of words in a vain attempt to convey some understanding of the true nature of Hamlet's turmoil, but a great actor could make an audience feel in in their bones.  How could an actor voice Hamlet's bloody thoughts with simultaneous blood-lust and shocked dismay at his own words?  I don't know but I pray I live to see it someday.   - Ray Eston Smith Jr

20081027004709AAkefMV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I hate Harry Potter & Twilight.Whats wrong with me?	I've read 3 HP books and the entire series of T.Its weird, but i just cant bring myself to like them.I've seen a lot of people liking either HP but hating Twilight or liking Twilight and hating HP, but never both. And thats coming from someone who cant live without books!The only reason i read on with both its 'cause i thought that MAYBE i could like them with the next book,but that didnt work. Though i admit if i had to choose it would probably be HP(but still). I found T. too sugar coated and unreal,the characters-flat,plot-boring,idea-not knew  and i could go on like this. HP was also a bit boring,idea-not that original, author's  vocabulary-small,some parts where too cheesy. You will probably hate me for saying that but thats just me(i dont want you to agree with my opinion,but at least respect it) Are their anyone out there like me?

Are you going to open it!?" she asked me cheerfully.   I hesitated, and carefully pulled at the end of the neat bow, letting it slowly   unravel, revealing the waiting present.   Sitting in the palm of my hand was a miniature silver locket,   small nicks and scratches overwhelmed the gleaming surface.

20081124092337AAq01a6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Come mai Twilight è così popolare?	Ora, non datemi subito contro, per favore. Vorrei puntualizzare che ho trovato Twilight (gli altri non li ho letti, ma lo farò appena qualcuno me li presterà) un libro piacevole, con buoni colpi di scena finali e una trama piuttosto appassionante.   Mi chiedo solo perchè risulti così popolare. Ho cercato di rispondermi ma non ci sono riuscita perciò chiedo il vostro parere (anche se ho la testa dura - a volte ne vado fiera - e probabilmente non mi convincerete). Le mie ipotesi finora sono:   a) è romantico, è una storia d'amore magnifica? Ho sentito parole che mi hanno colpito di più, e il romanticismo da due soldi non mi appassiona. Pure Jane Austen mi piace di più di Twilight (e io non sono un'amante delle romanticherie zuccherose), SENZA OFFESA PER NESSUNO, lo ribadisco.   b) Parla di vampiri? Per me è una cosa sacra il mito vittoriano del vampiro, se non altro legato alla sfera delle pulsioni dell'eros, o a quelle del rimorso e del tormento... ma ognuno ha i suoi punti di vista.   c) è scritto in maniera originale? A me pare molto ripetitivo nel lessico.      Se sapete dirmi qualcosa, fatelo. Sono una donna dalla mente aperta, ma dai gusti rigidi... penso. Non accetterò insulti per la mia mancanza di adorazione nei confronti di questa saga, se avete commenti del tipo: "è bellissimissimo" teneteveli per voi, io voglio motivazioni concrete.

20090227180148AAW1h4X	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is anyone else SICK of the TWILIGHT EPIDEMIC?	I read the book a few years back because I was told it was an "amazing vampire" story, so being a vampire lover of course I read it....I was dissapointed, not only was it not really a vampire story, it was just an angsty teenage romance. Ugh. So, plain, boring, loner Bella [who I think Stephenie Meyer happened to describe Bella much like herself] somehow happens to score gorgeous Edward, and GASP he's a vampire! They fall in love, aww...Pfft. Didn't like it. And every preteen, teenage girl drools over these books, why? Because it's angsty, it's easy to understand, it's "mushy", it's cliche...But to sum it up, I HATE this series mostly because of it's obsessive fans more than the literature itself. Anyone agree?
20090227175130AAP4klQ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How should I start my book?	Well. I'm not going to give full details on my book. But basically it's a trilogy, and I had written the first two books, but my computer got a virus and crashed and I lost EVERYTHING. So I'm rewriting the books. Sucks I know lol. So, which one of these ideas sounds best to start out my story? And please give me some hints on how to make it "gripping" and make it interesting enough for the reader to not want to put the book down. I've already had people tell me it's really interesting and good, but I suck at starting out the book and making the beginning "catch" the reader. So which idea sounds good? Btw it starts in the late 1700's and about vampires and werewolves.      a] Main character steals invitation to get into a social event, she stupidly leaves with an older boy, he beats her then the other main character finds her dieing in the middle of the woods and then "changes her".      b] Main character runs away and comes upon the other main character who at first tries to kill her, but "changes her".      I'm really having major writers block...So give me some more ideas, or something that may influence an idea. Thanks!

20090227174703AAcjtqX	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What should I write about?	We have a short story to compose on Monday, and I want to prepare for the English task today. So I was wondering, what should I write about? (Options below)      The short story is based on the stimulus 'light', and should be about 700-1000 words. These are my choices (although you can give me other ideas for a short story- based on the theme of 'light'- too!)      - a teenage girl just received the news of her being adopted. She has a photo of her birth parents except she can't see their faces because there's a flare in the photo. She thinks about her life, her identity, etc.   - this teenage girl can see auras around people- this aura-sight enables her to know who's about to die, how and when, depending on the strength of the person's aura. One day, she sees it on her mom and the story is about her trying to persuade her mum to stop drinking/taking drugs/etc. but her mum dies anyway      What do you think?

20090225104901AAFe23v	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Have you ever seen the ghost of your own future?	Awakening by the shore at Rowardennan      Daybreak by the loch   Like a snag on a fine mesh curtain   And though you pick as fast and frantic   as a tumbling hurdler,   It comes when its ready      Then as twilight   Trickles down the brae    Gently shaking the bracken   The heather   Recharging the colours   From their well earned sleep      I weep.      My back to the Ben   Still snow-capped in June   This daybreak warms not my skin.   The warmth starts from within      The bones may rattle and sway   in Loch Lomond’s great depths   Under the ledges   From whence divers turned grey.   In the twilight,   the bones have their say.      “We lie here in wait   and guard the child,   still waiting to be born.   One who may lift    the curse of the apathetic.   Lead the dire from the mire   and fill all your decanters   with a joyful pride,   that lets you welcome all   Inside.”      That child is a spirit   An essence   A hope.      In Loch Lomond’s waters   I saw it disappear.   May the bones bring it back   when the cynic is bleached,   and the wisdom of the Scots   Is universally preached.   We can live together,   when the claymore      we need, no more
20090225105650AA3hucI	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I just wrote this, read if you'd like...?	so i use to write poems a lot. but i stopped during the last couple of years. today i sat down and opened up a page and this just came out... i don't think it's very good. but maybe....       The girl standing in the corner watching everyone else play.    Who is she, what dose she want?   She has no idea what she’s doing here.   Looking at the pretty faces dancing the night away.   In her hand she holds a single letter, a letter for a boy.   A boy that broke her heart, a boy that put her here.   She thought that he was everything she ever wanted,   But the only thing he did was destroy her.   He called her names and slapped her face, just so    She’d fall to her knees and do everything he asked.    She wants to find that boy to just drop the letter in his coat pocket,   The letter that lets him know she won’t be his toy anymore.   She wants to fight this demon to stand up strong,   But god it’s just so damn hard.      She sees him, walking right in her direction.   Her gut says run, so she does.    She pushes all the pretty girls dancing out of her way   She runs out the door and into the woods.   Once she thinks she’s far enough she just falls and cries.   Thinking here I am again, stuck in this ******* life.    Full of pain and lonely nights.   She feels worthless and knows she’ll never be good enough.   This must be her fault, he tells her so every day.   She lets her self fall asleep laying on the ground.      sun shining in her face, she has no choice but to open her eyes.   She realizes that she has to pull herself up and go home before someone notices she’s gone.   Her head pounding, her heart racing. She hates this life, she can’t do it anymore.   She notices the cars zooming past.    “One step over that line and this would all go away.”   She waits until she can see the car, giving it’s driver no time to stop.      He finds himself sitting alone, no one knows it’s his fault.   “why do I feel guilty, she didn’t mean anything”   He reads the letter over again, the one he found  in her hand,   As he was begging her to stay alive.   Addressed to him it said    “you’ve took my soul, you’ve took my life. Enough is enough!    I refuse to be your play toy now. Tonight this will end”

20090225105622AA7Q7Hx	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Could you please read my story and give me feedback?	I love constructive criticism so please don't worry about offending me. I had to write this for a school project. Thank you.         "I"m not going!" I shouted at my mother. Our conversation started somewhere at "Joe, I'd like you to see this," and ended in between; "I'll never go," and a series of slammed doors.    My mother wanted me to do the unthinkable! It was shocking, slightly crazy. She wanted me to lie, falsely pose as a poor man. But the real thriller was the fact that she wanted me to go on an extended journey to explore the west!     This is where I started to doubt her intellect. She actually expected me, of all people, to leave my warm bed to travel on a stinky, smelly journey with crazy animals I've never seen or heard of before! And, for no purpose. She wanted me to "learn a lesson" A lesson in WHAT?! How miserable my life would be? I already knew that! But, because she was my mother, I wanted to please her. I scuffed up my boots, ran my clothes through the mud, tore them a little, tasseled my hair, and stepped forth into what I knew would be the worst time of my life.    Only four months in to this wasteful journey, Sargeant Floyd passed away. I didn't know what everyone was fussing about. He was just some poor man that I could use as a step ladder at best! Well, I pretended to feel a little bit of sadness, because everyone was all bent out of shape about it.     Three months passed, they were just as miserable as the first. No warm bed, or fresh food. We met our interpreters, there were many, but one stood out to me: Sacagawea. She looked young, yet she had a child forming inside of her. It started to make me wonder...    We reached the end of our journey. What we thought was the end though, was really a new beginning. We were about to leave Fort Mandan for St. Louis. I hate to admit it, but I was actually starting to like the place, and all the individuals there. A small, very small, part of me would miss this.     "Isn't she beautiful?" John Sheilds asked me.    "Beautiful?! That's an extreme understatement." Nothing in this undeveloped world could describe the waterfall in front of me. It poured out waves of mercy and grace. I knew this was the reason mother wanted me to come. Maybe she didn't know exactly what I'd find. But she knew the lesson I'd learn. The lesson of finding myself. Right here, I found myself at Great Falls. The rush of joyful tears sliding down my face matched the waterfall in front of me. The purpose of my entire journey lay here.     With a new sense of self, we continued on our way back to St. Louis. The pregnant woman had given birth a while earlier and when she met up with her brother, whom she'd been separated from, I was overjoyed. It had been almost two years in to our journey and it was Lewis' birthday. We decided to throw him a party. A small one, though. Sacagawea and her brother, Shoshone, taught us a native dance that was a thrill to learn.               It was September 23 when we finally arrived at St. Louis, the Corp of Discovery had been on this journey for almost three years! I was excited to get back home, but I would miss everyone. I just had one problem. They saw me as a poor man, but in reality, I was a high class man. I needed to tell them. But, they would never respect me again if they discovered I lied. I had some thinking to do...    "John, I need to say something. Please, let me finish before you make any judgments. I haven't been completely honest with everyone," I started to say to my dear friend. He would be the only one I told.    "I'm listening" the look in his eyes worried me.     "I'm not the poor man you think I am. I don't know how I thought I could keep it a secret from you, or anyone for that matter. And I-" He cut me off.    "Joseph, I know."    "But, how?"    "You were so cold to everyone. No man came on this journey unwillingly, except you. I've been determined to show you that there is more to life than what you thought since the beginning. I'm surprised you survived this trip at all. I honor you for being truthful. Please leave now."    I was shocked. How did he know? Three years and he had said nothing. I walked to my house, I had so much to think about. I reached my door, my mother was there to greet me.    "Hi darling, how was your trip? I'll bet you're hungry! I made your favorite. Come, sit, tell me about your journey." she flooded me with questions.    "Well ma', I'm actually really tired. Do you think we could talk about this tomorrow?"    "I suppose," she started with her pitiful voice.    I trudged to my sleeping area and lay down on my fluffed bed. Everything was as I left it. I closed my eyes and smiled to myself. I made it, and that was all that mattered.
