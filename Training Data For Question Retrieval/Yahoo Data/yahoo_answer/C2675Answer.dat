AraBfesHaa	1.)could be you're starving them to death.  Your tank will never have enough algae in the tank to keep them fed.  You have to supplement their diet with algae wafers/discs and fresh vegetables.  They also benefit from eating driftwood.<br>  2.)  they're definitely in a tank too small for them.  Valarie is wrong.  If it's a common pleco, it will grow to 2' long.  Mine are 22" now, after 2 years.  They need a minimum of a 55 gallon tank, preferably bigger.  anything smaller will stunt their growth, meaning they'll stop growing externally, but their organs will continue to grow inside, slowly killing them.<br>  You haven't said, though, so maybe you have the type of pleco that stays small.  there are several breeds of those.  Other than those two things, I can't see why they only stay at 2".  I start mine out in smaller tanks than that and once they've grown to 5-6", I move them to the larger tanks.  i can only guess the're not getting enough to eat.  They are voracious eaters.  <br>  Try giving them zucchini, cucumbers, mushrooms, lettuce, kale, french cut green beans, etc., but you'll have to weigh them down so they'll sink to the bottom for the plecos to get.|`|qMO9S6kvaa	I have also gone through a couple plecos in a few occasions sadly, but i do agree, It may be too crowded and small of a tank for a pleco. plecos get to be about a foot long at max, why would you want this large of a fish in a 30 gallon? little too large of a species for a 30 gallon. 50 should be a minimum sized tank for these lunkers. try getting a chinease algae eater. I have had great luck with them in all of my different sized tanks. also Plecos are not the most durable breed of fish :/|`|0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	30 gallons is sort of small for most Plecos,but I'll bet you are starving them to death. Plecos require Algae discs or fresh vegetables in their diets as well as (Believe it or not) some drift wood up which to chew. They are not scavengers and do not eat excrement, they are vegetarians.|`|oMmBhWK4aa	Your tank is really too small for such fishes. At their max size, the bala, clown loach & pleco may be about 1/3 of your tank length or more! The silver dollars are close to their max size but the rest are way off and thus may be starving or having poor appetites due to poor water quality, feeling stressed/lonely (for schooling fish). <br>  <br>  The larger the fish the more the poop, so you need both a really good filter and dedicated regular water changes. Not all plecos have the same requirements but generally you need to supplement their diet with algae or spirulina bottom feeder wafers/tablets, especially if your tank has little algae. Put 1-2 wafers every other day. You can put some smooth rocks into water exposed to sunlight, then transfer these algae-covered rocks to your tank for your pleco. Also put a few pieces of cleaned boiled driftwood or bog wood for the pleco to rasp on.<br>  <br>  My experience with plecos is that they grow really fast & poop like crazy. And they are not really very effective for algae cleaning duties. Someone suggested Chinese algae eaters, which should really be avoided since they get more aggressive & territorial as they mature, end up preferring fish food to algae and may latch on to the bodies of larger fish to suck their slime coating, stressing these fish sometimes to the point of death.|`|82fdac47003fd405ff244c6f7af240d1aa	What kind of pleco do you have? Further more, why do you have multiple plecos in one tank?<br>  <br>  This tank is WAY to small for the fish you have. After 3 years your bala should be 9-10 inches and they should be in a school.  Your silver dollars should be about 6 inches AT LEAST! Also, they're a schooling fish.<br>  <br>  Fish stop growing for pretty much one reason, ammonia poisoning. Judging from the massive overstock of this tank and the fact that it seems like the growth has stopped in ALL your fish I'd say your water has from time to time for long periods of time or is continously so toxic with ammonia that nothing can grow.<br>  <br>  Scaleless fish are particularly sensitive to water conditions. I'm surprised the clown loach is alive. Also, your clown loach might be killing them.<br>  <br>  Plecos should be fed algae AND carnivore pellets. They do require natural wood for ruffage for digestion.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	The bala shark grows to 12 inches and is a schooling fish. <br>  <br>  Clown loaches also grow to 12 inches and are also schooling fish.<br>  <br>  Plecos, the common variety, grows to 24 inches and needs tanks that are at least 125-175 gallons.<br>  <br>  They are dying either from ammonia (do you do water changes often enough?). They shouldnt die from stunting (when their body stops growing but their organs dont. Something that will happen to your other fish.), stunting takes a few years to take effect, but is a very painful death.<br>  <br>  But, another possible reason... Plecos are the most common fish to die of starvation. They need separate feeding times and be fed at night. After you turn off your tank lights, wait about a half hour to an hour, then drop in an algae wafer. Plecos are nocturnal, and feed at night.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	As the others suggest, tank space and feeding. Plecos need a large amount of vege based food to survive and grow to their full size, and some higher protien stuff as well.<br>  <br>  If your other fish have lived for three years it's hard to fault your tank care, but those fish are starting to outgrow that tank now.<br>  <br>  But the pleocs likely starved.<br>  <br>  My big sailfin is 6years old and about a foot long, but he gets lots of algae wafers, some fresh veges and shrimp pellets, As a special treat, a whole shrimp.<br>  <br>  Check your plecos belly, it should be rounded and bulging out a little. If it's sunken, it's starving.<br>  <br>  Have a look at this pic, see how the stomach is fat, thats how they should look.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u255/ianab_photos/plecoJune08.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u255/...</a><br>  <br>  Ian

AM7CgQ4daa	She considers the puppy a visitor, and not part of her pack.   make sure to feed them separately, in different rooms, this may help her relax.  Take her out and spend time with just the two of you.   also spend time playing with both of them, so she learns that she can have fun with the puppy there.   Make the games fun with noise and treats, you have to help them bond.<br>  Don't overreact, many older dogs give puppies a nip if they annoy them.|`|BpKECFBSaa	Thats normal. Dogs usually hate puppies, especially ones past the age of 5. Unfortunatley, there isnt really anything you can do about it. Let your rhodesian ridgeback lay out the puppy and teach it a lesson. As for feeding, feed them seperatley, because it sounds like the older dog is a bit food aggressive. I go through this everytime I foster a puppy because my dog despises young annoying dogs! Haha! Well, good luck! And good job with rescueing!

aeonmRR2aa	The problem is called "Green Water".  This is caused by various floating unicellular algae; your tank was sterile of it, and got infected by the plants (most tanks have green water organisms in the water).  A tank (or pond!) left outdoors will eventually get infected just from the air, or perhaps from an insect carrying a cell on its body from a nearby pond.  Opinions differ, but my conclusion from personal experience and reading dozens of articles is that green water is caused by these factors:<br>  <br>  1)  Ammonia<br>  2)  Lots of Light<br>  3)  Warm, Aerated, Moving Water<br>  4)  Low Bacteria Population<br>  5)  Frequent Water Changes (once it starts) or  Not Enough Water Changes (before it starts)<br>  6)  Overstocked and Overfed Aquarium<br>  <br>  Green water tends to occur in brand new tanks, tanks exposed to actual sunlight, and ponds in the Spring.  Green water blooms suddenly and can persist for weeks, but invariably, it will disappear overnight.  This is inevitable - it will ALWAYS happen, unless the water is changed too frequently.<br>  <br>  Green water is very healthy for fish; don't worry about it!  During the day it absorbs ammonia, phosphate, nitrate, CO2, all the bad stuff from the water and puts out oxygen.  The only risk is that at night it sucks oxygen out of the water and if it is as thick as split pea soup and you have bad circulation and no air bubblers, your fish can suffocate.<br>  <br>  As long as you have thick green water, you will have virtually no ammonia or nitrite, and possibly no nitrate!  This is good.  But it is ugly and can get so bad that you can't see your cute little fish.<br>  <br>  Therefore - to make it go away, you can do one or more of these things:<br>  <br>  1)  EASIEST:  Wait, and only change the water 20% per week, no more.  Eventually the green water will crash.  It is not clear why this happens - either a natural algae toxin builds up in the water, or else a population of predators suddenly outnumbers the algae.  Once the crash happens (water will no longer be green, but clear or yellow/brownish) do a 50% water change immediately, and another 25% the next day if the water is yellowish or brownish.<br>  2)  Clean your gravel with a gravel vac.  This removes nitrogen-containing waste.<br>  3)  Treat with algicide.  Bad for plants, and... well, just generally bad.  But it absolutely works!<br>  4)  Increase filtration to drive cycle back to bacteria instead of algae.<br>  5)  Put plants back in and add a low-nitrogen fertilizer (potassium, phosphorous, and iron).<br>  6)  Cover your tank for 4 days and keep the lights off.<br>  7)  Add 1/2 tsp sugar per 100 gallons of tank size, once per day.  This will increase the growth of bacteria and eventually outcompete the algae.<br>  <br>  I recommend 1, 2, and 5.  I don't recommend 3.<br>  <br>  What not to do:<br>  Do not replace your water often.  This will keep the green water going!  You can do a 25% water change every day for the next week, and it will not remove the green water (though it might be a good idea anyway since it will remove some of the excess nitrogen!  But after you do a water change or two, STOP.  From then on just do a 20% or less once a week until the green water is gone, then do partial changes however you want.<br>  Do not feed your fish as much.  This adds nitrogen!<br>  Do not replace your filter pad(s), and do not clean it unless it is clogged.  This removes bacteria!<br>  Do not buy an algae eater to eat this algae.  They only eat algae on surfaces!<br>  Do not buy a clam or a filter-feeding shrimp.  It will clean the green water in 2 days, then starve to death over the next week (shrimp) or 4 months (clam)!<br>  Do not buy a UV filter.  They are expensive.  They will solve the problem in a few days, but why bother?  If you want to kill it dead, it's faster and cheaper to use algicide, and cheaper (and about the same speed) to use the blackout method.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  P.S.  You may want to save some in a jar, and even offer it for sale on Craigslist.  Green Water is used as food for various things like fish fry and filter-feeders in marine aquariums, so it is in high demand.<br>  <br>  P.P.S.  This is a good site for lots of aquarium info.<br>  <a href="http://www.skepticalaquarist.com/docs/algae/green.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.skepticalaquarist.com/docs/al...</a><br>  <br>  P.P.P.S.  Partial water changes are GOOD.  They are NECESSARY in most aquariums.  They DO NOT CAUSE GREEN WATER, they PREVENT it.  However, once green water starts, big water changes will keep it there.  Just to be perfectly clear!|`|a10bc721ba2137d257423e36dab2ddcaaa	you need a better filter and look into buying water treament safe for fish that helps with plants, also underwater plants need light, so keep the tank lid on and lit with a UV,  but, make shure you also change the water few times a week, ither by taking the water and using a pump to drain while running fresh water in, or transfer the fish and fully clean it, but may harm fish. also alge eaters, a slug looking fish will help, 1 for a very small tank, as many as 20 for large ones|`|ccgcJ9PKaa	probably you have to clean the inside of the tank out then replace the water|`|uHxfAyjBaa	You accidently put lime kool-aid in instead of fish food?|`|qMO9S6kvaa	Keeping your light on 24/7 will only make this worse..... i dont know what doug is talking about.

hC4Z8HIbaa	Please do NOT seperate them. Rat owners have a term they use when trying to figure out rat fights. "No blood, no foul." If there was no blood, then it was not a serious fight, or even a fight at all. Rats establish a rank order system in cages, with one being the alpha or dominant rat. Your rat was just showing the other rat that she is the dominant one. If the rat did not fight back, then it was not a fight but more a show of dominance. Your rat may have been doing something as simple as grooming the other rat, which does look like biting.<br>  <br>  Please check out the website below. It is an online forum for rat owners, and it has a lot of good information. It is one of the best resources to have if you plan on keeping rats.|`|CVrLmjebaa	Seperate them in two different cages.

Remember that once they start biting they usually will not stop.

qUeNrusdaa	I do a lot of volunteer work at the Humane Society and I work with all sorts of dogs.  Here's what I strongly recommend to everyone who's thinking of adopting:<br>  <br>  1.  Before you even look at any dogs, sit down and make a list of what you really want in a dog.  List everything you can think of - long-hair/short hair, active/laid back, barks a lot/ barks a little/silent, guard dog?  companion dog?, needs lots of exercise/needs little exercise/self-muscling, nice with everyone/one-person-dog,  good inside/needs a yard, small/medium/large, brown fur/white fur/mixed color, smart/not-so-smart, etc.  Everything you can think of.  Do this FIRST!!<br>  2.  When you have your list, do some research online.  I recommend the site listed below for more information on dog breeds.<br>  3.  Now you'll be ready to good to the shelter (please consider adopting a rescue), or the pet shop, or a breeder.<br>  4.  Remember, choose wisely - you are, hopefully, making a lifetime commitment!  (That means 12-15+ years.)<br>  <br>  BTW, I recommend you write your list first, because if you go to a shelter first and look into those sweet puppy eyes, you'll want to take them all home with you!<br>  Good luck!!|`|AA11426077	number one pick=labrador retriever-will be the best dog you ever own, hands down. good for every family type, especially kids and is very active.<br>  <br>  rhodesian ridgeback-great family dogs, very very little shedding, great dogs for runners because rhodesians have been known to run 20+ miles without getting tired...its part of their african lionhound ancestry. so they are very sporty<br>  <br>  german shepherds are great dogs, very affectionate and loving like a lab, but a little more shedding, and they are active dogs as well<br>  <br>  some other "active" breeds<br>  <br>  wiemeraner<br>  vizsula<br>  doberman<br>  germain pointers<br>  greyhound|`|8l5wC4Zeaa	Jack Russel Terriers match that description.<br>  <br>  picture: <a href="http://cdn-www.dailypuppy.com/media/dogs/anonymous/Vigo_Parson_Jack_Russel_Terrier_01.jpg_w450.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cdn-www.dailypuppy.com/media/dogs...</a>

L22hVXTIaa	You're right to be worried about this behavior.  While your older dog has only growled at this point, he could get completely fed up and really let the little guy have it.  What you need to do is tell him "no" - but only once.  If he starts in again, take the puppy from the room where the older dog is and put the puppy in a room by himself and leave him there.  And, he only gets the one chance.  After that each time he starts to annoy the older dog, take the puppy and put him in another room by himself.  Use a baby gate so that he can see you and the older dog, but can't get back in.  I think he'll make the association quickly enough!|`|RKZHGqh7aa	Let them alone. Eventually the pup will push the older dog to the edge and the older dog will teach him not to bother him.|`|jwbLkaAoaa	My puppy does the same thing with the other three older dogs. You can try and discipline him but I guarantee that when your older dog gets tired of it that he will fight back or snap on him. It's normal. Don't freak out. It helps the younger dog find his place.
p3vjvzRPaa	Your vet's reaction sounds pretty odd.  Sounds like the way a vet would react if a dog was on a special diet for some reason and the owners weren't following it.<br>  <br>  Is your puppy suffering from allergies? is she overweight? is she suffering from any other health issues?<br>  <br>  If not, then I don't see what the big deal is, unless your vet has a deal with the pet food suppliers and doesn't want you feeding anything else!<br>  <br>  Some people see raw egg white as a risk due to salmonella, but raw yolks are usually ok.  Cooked eggs certainly pretty harmless.<br>  <br>  There are lots of alternatives to dry food and I don't understand why a vet would bite your head off for adding more natural food into her diet.<br>  <br>  If your dog has some health issue, then it is foolish and cruel to add other foods to the diet your vet recommended.<br>  <br>  AFTER ADDITIONAL INFO:  OK, so I was right that there was a health reason for the vet's response.  Your parents are being cruel to your puppy.  What they are doing is like giving peanuts to someone who is allergic to them - why would you do it?  Tell them it's not worth risking your puppy's health.|`|Fvuq2Nwiaa	Per:<a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1659&aid=1030" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a><br>  <br>  "Raw eggs Contain an enzyme called avidin, which decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin).

My dog got sick right before christmas and I had to take her to the vet because of it.   Separate the boxes or perhaps invest in an automatic litter box (not sure how it would work witht the puppy)  I think that they are motion activated and scoop the box after it is used.|`|AA11457471	Yes, quit being a skinflint & open a door!

Cat poop is very far more dangerous than dog poop. Spirokeets I think is the bateria, and its very dangerous.

It's my favorite store.|`|7BqOnBa8aa	I think there are many groomers out there that are abusive, and it has nothing to do with Petsmart. I've shopped there for years, and never seen it happen myself. It's a fact that in any large group of people who work with animals, (or children, or seniors, etc) there will be a few abusers in the bunch.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	who says they abse animals? i dont see how they have a rescue adoption center right as you walk in and when your looking at the other pets they have signs around letting you know that in the back they have more pets that you can adopt. i think theyre great i got alot of my rodents from there & they live a long time and are healthy.|`|BpKECFBSaa	I dont think so! You seem to take care of your animals that are there! Their cages are always clean, the animals are healthy, and they are fine!

146iNd9Iaa	rap it in a coat and smack it with a hammer|`|mfOwtsOOaa	I have 2 mice at the moment, but Ive had up to 20 at a time before and owned more than that and from experience if you want a cuddly pet you can handle a lot you've chosen the wrong one. Rats are cleaner and nicer. My first mouse was a little pest that bit me anytime I touched her and I had to learn to treat her as an "ornament" fresh food, clean water... and let her live her own way.<br>  You can't put it down just coz it bit you, it's obviously not tame yet, some never fully tame. Ive also had a friend who had a mouse that was the cutest most placid thing Ive ever seen, it was like a baby. You will have to pick up the mouse and only handle it for very short periods at a time frequently, the tapping of the nose thing sounds ok if it works but its never worked for my rats and Ive never tried it on mice.|`|BpKECFBSaa	Oh my god... Seriously, if you don't want her, give her to someone who deserves to own a pet, because if you want to put a MOUSE down for biting you, you're insane. I own 8 rodents and have been bit by all of them. You were probably being a ***** and handling her wrong. My mouse was at an animal rescue that I work at and he bit me when I was trying to clean his cage. My hand swelled up and I had to get 6 rabies shots in my butt! Guess what? A week later, Tanto was my pet! Yeah, I took him home because nobody wanted a mouse that bit, except me! So, go give her to someone who gives a damn and knows how to handle mice. Euthanasia is evil unless Absolutely necessary in my opinion.|`|lXBVrik7aa	Definitely don't! They bite sometimes, but definitely not something to put it down because of. Flick her on the nose (not too hard) every time she bites you, she will probably stop after that because she will have learned what happens when she bites. Hope I helped :)|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	If/when she bites you make a point of yelping. I'm told they get the point that it hurts you very quickly. Have you had her awhile or is she new & still needing time to get used to you? If so are you forcing her to let you pick her up? If she isn't comfortable around you then of course she's going to bite out of fear. Give her time to get used to you and take it slow.|`|qWIRkiTYaa	no you shouldn;t put it down. and the animal wouldn't do anything. haha just give it a tap on the nose and discipline it a bit. it worked with my rats and bunnny=]|`|JxIKUC9baa	NO!!! i guess your a first time mouse owner. if a mouse bites you , you just give it a tap on the nose and say no. and gradualy it will learn not to bite.|`|w6JkIbjhaa	no durr!|`|D8OzQwXKaa	Mouse didnt bite me, it shocked me. i need to buy a new one from apple|`|OeQbs95Naa	OMG Talk about being cruel!

zAhBlMQLaa	No...Boston terriers are small, well proportioned dogs. They usually weigh  30-40 lbs. They cannot tolerate in high temperature and also in cold weather. They are mammals thus they are warm blooded.|`|PM23RDycaa	All mammals are warm blooded. this includes dogs and thus Bostons.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	They are a mammal, therefore they are warm blooded....|`|7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	No....all dogs are warm blooded.<br>  How on earth could you think a dog would  be cold blooded???<br>  <br>  Boy, do I feel stupid.   Of course  that is what you mean....as B.T.owner  said....you want to know if they tolerate cold well  or not.  But that's not what you asked. <br>  I agree....w/B.T....they do not have the best  coat for cold weather....that is obvious....so  they would do best in warmer climates.  Or put a sweater on it.  That would work.|`|E5fkULfYaa	let's see<br>  <br>  ALL mammals = warm-blooded<br>  ALL Boston Terriers = mammals<br>  <br>  Therefore...no surprise here folks,<br>  <br>  ALL Boston Terriers are warm-blooded animals|`|vAnEp2pKaa	Dogs have hair.<br>  Mammals have hair.<br>  Mammals are warm blooded.<br>  Dogs are mammals.<br>  <br>  What do you think ?|`|taLD45Sqaa	HAHA I love the answers here!|`|iVVen0Lgaa	I think people are misunderstanding your question.  If you really mean "Do Boston terriers get cold easily?" the answer is yes.  They have short, single coats.  That means that they don't have an insulating undercoat the way that many dogs like Labs, collies, etc. have.  While Bostons can go outside in weather in the 20's (Fahrenheit) for short periods of time, like a potty run, they can't stay out but just a few minutes like that without getting very cold.  So if you are somewhere that's cold and you want to go for a walk, put a sweater on your dog.  Even then, don't stay out too long.  <br>  <br>  If the inside of your house is at least 65 or so the dogs will be just fine with no sweater although some just like their sweaters.  I live in the southern U.S. and we don't get tons of cold weather, although we get many winter nights in the teens and 20's.  My house stays about 65-67 in the winter.  My dogs LOVE to have the fireplace going and they will go and lay in front of the fire.  Just as people like to warm by the fire, so do the dogs.  Bostons are also pretty cuddly dogs.  They like to snuggle down into blankets or a fluffy pillow when they sleep.<br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question.|`|ZdwOz1APaa	As people before me have answered, no, they are not cold blooded. All mammals are warm blooded, dogs = mammals.<br>  <br>  I am taking a guess here, but I think you might have a boston, or a friend who has one that likes to lay in the sun. My boston would always lay in the sun, she napped there and enjoyed it! since most boston's coats are mostly black, the heat is absorbed into their fur and keeps them warm, kind of like what a heating pad does for us.|`|Z9eH58d7aa	no..they're warm blooded just like any dog out there|`|UdoLcwm4aa	Almost.|`|B9KGdYdJaa	no
AA11457471	Your vet is correct about the hormones taking 2 mos. (or longer) to clear her system.<br>  <br>  There's a product called Feliway that mimics the "happy cat" pheromone.<br>  I swear by it! It's very helpful as a stress tamer.<br>  Most pet stores carry it but the cheapest I've found it is at healthypets.com.<br>  I'd recommend getting several diffusers & put them in the areas your cat spends the most time in.|`|aO5ErghMaa	Just wait a while and the aggressiveness should stop. Its better that you keep your cat locked for a while so it doesn't hurt anyone.|`|8QxXAmn4aa	Make sure you sleep with her a few weeks and also make sure she takes a cold shower with you early in the morning for the heat to go away.

AA11771532	if you do not know how to do this ur self, then please get a professional to do it. There have been way tooo many accidents from inexperienced people trying to teach their horses how to pull a cart. Most people dont realize how dangerous this is. <br>  <br>  Does your horse know how to ground drive? This is the most important step. if he can ground drive then he can do everything else. Start your horse on a lunge line. Once he can lunge, then add a second lunge line and lunge him with one line like normal and the other line running along his other side and coming off his butt. In other words, he should be in between the 2 line. This is the one step that will take more patience than anything. Once he can lunge in both directions in the two lines, then he should be ok. Gradually shorten the lines so that you are able to walk off to the side about 2 feet from him and keep him working in the direction that you want him to go in. Once you have him used to this, get him into a basic harness and continue to work him in 2 lines as before. Then gradually add on side reins. These attatch to the harness and the bit. It will teach him to give to the bit. Have him stand in his stall for about 30 mins with the side reins attatched so that he gets used to it. Do this about 2 times a week. Then once he is working in the side reins, the harness, and 2 lines, get him used to being attatched to a wooden sled. The sled can be just a few pieces of wood nailed together but make sure that it isnt dangerous for the horse if he shoudl step on it. The sled needs to have some weight on it so that he can feel it. once he is used to that, then u can add a real cart. please use assistance for the actual pulling of anything as well as lowerring the shafts the first few times. You will want someone to distract his head. If in doubt, please call a trainer.  Hiring a professional is better than you spending time in the hospital or your horse spending time in the hospital or you or the animal ending up dead due to lack of experience.|`|AA10572595	Ken Z answer is VG.Instead of collar you mite also try a lighter breast  strap.If training with a western saddle eq.with a strong saddle horn you can train by pulling objects which are lite.I have trained many horses .I am training 4 presently.BE very carefull esp. if training hot bloods.Go sloooowwly,and be very gentle,Quietly and patiently ask for simple tasks.Before you start working with harness,and the bridle has blinders ,ask yourself :Do I need  them?Would the traaining go better without them?|`|a0f3adf33e406aba910ed76b0de8f72aaa	depends on the age of the horse but i think you should get a specialist to do it for ya :)|`|e16689ac4295c3be24d517f75226bb80aa	Training a horse tends to be a slow process of getting them use to it. Begin with putting the harness or collar to get them use to it. Then put on a couple reins and walk behind them useing the reins to get them use to them being pulled from behind. Next attach the cart but still walk beside the cart so they get use to the weight of the cart. finnally hope in the cart and hopefully the training has paid off. Now this is not a one day thing and depends on the temperament of the horse. But in time and with patiants it will work. Be sure to reward the horse with a treat for positive hehavior|`|f50389a497df5a69fe4b065151efb74eaa	i have a friend that does and when i get the number i will give it to you.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|9439577287c89721deb85e4735b6ccefaa	Get a cane pole and hang a carrot on it in front of the horse......|`|7836d3ca7b1d67fb9e7bf9b98c5106cdaa	im teaching my goat to pull a cart????????

The answer truly is "DONT." <br>  <br>  Around Christmas time a lot of people are given animals they decide not to keep for one reason or another, and we are suddenly flooded with animals needing our help. It is both sad and overwhelming.<br>  <br>  If he wants a new cat, by all means bring him by your local animal shelter. He should be the one to pick it out, as he has to live with it.

98a078d7c53cf386253edbc8b11fd0bcaa	Racoons don't make good pets! They can be nice for a while and then turn wild! I had a friend that had a racoon, they rescued it as a baby, well...one day it just went crazy then ran off. Plus they can carry rabies...very dangerous. <br>  I've never heard of anyone acctually breeding racoons for pets...I'm sure its probably illegal!|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Try typing in racoon breeders onto the search engine of your computer.  This will give all the people that are raising them.  Caution however:  Racoons are great when they are tiny.  They are adorable and very sweet.  But when the racoon is grown and starts coming of age, so to speak, the get down right awnry!  And yes, they can get very very distructive to people and your house.|`|fd2bb3ca04273fc7309060439445cc8aaa	Why do you whant a racoon??there MEAN thay bite and i think its againsed the law to have one as a pet
3388b2b1591a91e7855a317777ee76f6aa	First off check petfinder.com<br>  <br>  Finding a ferret in CA. is going to be difficault. You might want to consider crossing into another state. That is what I have heard most people in CA. have had to do.<br>  <br>  If you are getting one, please remember that there are thousands of ferrets in shelters that need good homes. Also, if this will be your first ferret, a baby is not always the best choice. They are a handful.<br>  <br>  Finally. As a ferret owner, I have to ask you to PLEASE do your research on ferrets before you get one. I know they are cute and fun, but there are ALOT of downsides to owning a ferret. Hence the reason there are so many in the shelters. I own 5 ferrets at the moment, but I have had many others in the past also. Ferrets are alot of work and are VERY expensive to own. Make sure you have a vet near by that will not only see ferrets, but are also well experienced with them.|`|e3724e5b23568b699c3b7d3bebdf612aaa	I think you can have one in CA, but you can't buy one in CA, so, go out of state.|`|AA11485975	They're illegal because everyone in California is in fact ... a ferret!|`|2740af7b3b29475db50a50b9faf602ecaa	What about looking for an online pet store that would sell you one...|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Just bring it in, in a cage.  Whenever the border stops you, all they are ever looking for is whether or not you are bringing fresh fruits into Califronia.|`|8b4985d6dcd90cd3df25afd6db14e88eaa	As bad as you may want one, it is very unfair to the ferret to bring it into an area where it is illegal. If found, it will be put to sleep.<br>  <br>  If I were you, i'd either move, or begin supporting the fight to make ferrets legal in california.|`|a87cc31446c69b19d35d73a77f2133eeaa	Um obviously the state cares! It's illegal dude, if you want one move to another state where you can have one LEGALLY.
f16072f55c3a5dcce8f05f45296b0152aa	At about to years of age some female pairs can all of a sudden start fighting. There is no guarantee it will or won't happen. Even with you establishing dominance as a leader it won't necessarily stop them. It will help greatly but relize as people we can only be there leader to an extent because we communicate differently. If it was this easy there would be no such thing as aggressive dogs. Spaying them early will help too.  I would say go ahead with it but continue your research and be prepared to have to hire a behaviorist if it does go wrong.<br>  Be sure to buy from a reputable Iggy breeder because they will help you tremendously and they have bred stable temperments and are trust worthy.<br>  You may have looked here already but here is the IG clubs site. There are very good articles and a breeder referal section.<br>  <a href="http://www.italiangreyhound.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.italiangreyhound.org/</a><br>  If you contact a reputable breeder I'm sure they will answer any questions.<br>  Good luck and thanks for being a responsible future dog owner.|`|024012470ea4882c22fcfb0bbd70d79caa	well i have TWO rat terrier puppies, they ALWAYS fight and they came out of the same litter, there figting for ranks if they know your the alpha!  if your going to get both (its a big time consuming process as a warning) at lease get them there own sleeping spot, ALWAYS watch them when there in the room together just incase any fights break out, and you may want to consider obdience training, dont ALWAYS put them together then they will suffer from seperation exotidy YOU DONT WANT THAT! and always spend time with each one, teach them sepreatly, walk them sepreatly as well  because since they will be puppies they will need to walk on the leash. <br>  <br>  best of luck. <br>  -Syetta|`|afa52a74ce7b4357a257fad514a51986aa	It really depends on their personality towards other dogs. In my house I am the pack leader, then my German shepard is the 2nd in command because she is more dominant. My Golden Retriever is very submissive and so she is in the bottom spot in my house. They had their quarrels when first put in the house together but as long as one submits to the other you should be okay. However if you have to dominant Iggys, like my shepard and my moms shepard, putting them together can be bad. Our dogs will not submit to each other and have gotten into a lot of fights if they arent separated. So if you have two dominant Iggys the same thing can happen, just on a smaller scale (though little dogs can be as brutal) I think you should be okay but just watch how they interact with each other to make sure no one gets hurt. They are about the cutest dogs. I love them to death. Have you thought of names? I like Issabella, or Gabriella (Izzy and Gabby) or if you chose a boy how about Antonio, or Leonardo. just a few Italian names for you to go with your Italian Greyhounds. lol|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	If you get them as puppies and they're raised together, your chances of having problems are much less.  I've found that sight hounds in general (and yes, I know they're toys) are much more willing to get along.  I've always had afghan females together with never a problem, as well as greyhounds (my own and fosters) and females tend to get along.  Unless you're unfortunate enough to get one who's very alpha, but you can nip that in the bud when they're puppies.|`|723c4346aaf773f03bb7ce450acfb93eaa	They may quibble a little bit over dominance over each other. As long as both recognize you as the pack leader, and they don't cause actual injuries to each other, let them. They'll work it out and all will be peaceful when they do. <br>  <br>  I prefer females, too, so I know where you're coming from. I find that if they're spayed/neutered, neither gender fights more than the other. Good luck with your new pets!|`|306a5da7a4bbe9184cd02f0c766e26b8aa	Sighthounds are generally not scrappy type dogs, some people have hordes of IGs with no problems.  Any Sighthound breed prefers to have their own kind around and they are MUCH happier in a multi SH family.<br>  <br>  That said, littermates tend to bond with each other and not as much with the owner.  I would get one and then plan on another in 6 mths - 1yr.  Littermates, and those very close in age, WILL tend to 'feed' off each other, and IGs are ALREADY very busy dogs.  <br>  <br>  I kept 2 Whippet pups from my last litter, and haved vowed to never do it again.  Two is MUCH harder than one!  SH people that grow out whole litters must be INSANE!<br>  <br>  <br>  You should also know that some are susceptable to having seperation anxiety, which is another reason 2 are better than one.  Maybe you should think about getting an adult IG to be with your puppy.|`|3dcd4b2883069afa1a5a6088e43acfadaa	any dog will fight for dominance wheather there the same breed, my mini dachshund fights his own mother for dominance because he is an idiot half the but anyways you will get it no matter what.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	There is no problem having two female dogs together.  I'm delighted you are doing your research.|`|b2ff848f33f0260916ab368f7fc3f037aa	um, maybe u should put them together before u buy them so u can see if they will get along.  don't bring a male in if u got 2 females?  hope they get along!  best of luck!
8b4985d6dcd90cd3df25afd6db14e88eaa	Ferrets are illegal in California. I highly suggest you think twice before getting one. If you are found to have one, the animal will be put down.|`|e3724e5b23568b699c3b7d3bebdf612aaa	I believe you can own a ferret in CA, but you cannot buy one inside the state limits.  You would have to go out of state to do that legally.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Try searching the internet.  If there is one for sale, they should have it listed.  Otherwise, check with your local petshop.
Elop7R08aa	I am from Indiana.  Each state has differing regulations for people who want to become veterinary technicians or technologists.  I have recently graduated from an AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association) accredited veterinary technology school (Purdue University) with an associate's degree.  A lot of states require you to get a college education from an AVMA accredited school.  After that, you must take the national vet tech boards, which is an examination that consists of around 200 questions.  If you pass, then you will recieve your Registered Veterinary Technician license (depending on what state you're in, it could instead be Licensed Vet Tech or Certified Vet Tech).  You are also required to pass the state exam, which is about 30 questions, and is specific to each state in the US.  I am now continuing my education at Purdue University for a bachelor's degree, which will then allow me to be a "veterinary technologist" the differences between technician and technologists are that the latter generally have more annual salary and have a broader opportunity for jobs (they could be teachers for a vet tech program, office managers, start their own business, or focus in one area such as specialty medicine, behavior, dentistry, management, etc.)  I am not saying the technician with an AS degree cannot do these things, but the BS degree nowadays is preferred, depending on where you come from and where you would like to work.  Annual salary or hourly wages differs A LOT depending on where you live also.  The range is about 26,000 to 30,000 for AS degree and 28,000 to 32,000 for BS.  Of course, you could get as low as 20,000 per year or even as high as 50,000 per year depending on your education, location, and what you decide to do for a job (small animals vs. large animal, etc.)  I can show you a website from my school, which does provide an online program where you can get your AS in 3 or 4 years.  If you choose to go their, the AS program is only 18 months long, and the BS is just 12 months after the AS has been awarded.  Go to <a href="http://www.vet.purdue.edu/vettech" rel="nofollow">http://www.vet.purdue.edu/vettech</a><br>  Also, check your state website (www.indiana.gov) to see what the requirements are for vet tech licensing.  Good luck to you!<br>  PS.  There are some people out there that have been working for a veterinarian as an assitant for a year or two and they call themselves "veterinary technicians".  Please, do not do this.  This is a misdemeanor and you can be punished for it by the law.  It is the same thing as calling yourself a veterinarian, even though you are not one.  If you know any people who are doing this, let them know that they are walking on eggshells right away!  There are some "loopholes" for people in this situation to get a license.  First, they have to prove that they have been working for a veterinarian for quite some time, and then they must follow the regulations of the state they live in to get their license.  Some states may allow you to take the boards without having a college degree if you have been working for a vet for 5 years or something, but you would need to check your state's website for further information.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Mindy E. answered this quite well.|`|ad5dbaa8702cb01dccabcac838657fe2aa	well you need a vet tech degree. I don't know an exact figure for you but they don't make a ton of money, because its like rn's for animals. if you just google vet tech schools they will pull up a ton of websites for you. I could list a bunch. but just search it and you'll find all the answers you need.
kEg0T7I0aa	Where there is a will, nature will find a way!  TAKE HER TO THE VET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|OgVmHwW6aa	Better to have her vet checked.  If she was in heat, you'd have known.  There would have been pandemonium in the house.  If the vet gives the all clear, I'd get her spayed.  There are low-cost and free clinics, if you need them.  A call the the local humane society will help you fiond one.  Would be a good idea to get the male puppy neutered too.  :-)|`|SAMOD9dgaa	I would take your girl to the vet ASAP to see if she is pregnant.  It's important to inform your vet and ask for his advice, especially if you have never bred a dog before.  Your vet will be able to inform you how far along she is, what sort of diet she should be on, any special treatment she will need, how many pups there are, as well as give you some good info about the birthing process.<br>  <br>  That being said, I would also just like to remind you that dogs rarely control themselves if they don't have to.  Just because you never saw your puppy mount your girl doesn't mean he wasn't interested.  If you have to unaltered animals - male and female - it is almost a 100% guarantee that puppies will soon follow.  If you do not plan to breed your dogs - a serious process (you have no idea how expensive it can be and how difficult it can be to place some puppies) - I would urge you to have both dogs fixed ASAP.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|TBJSH2tTaa	u should probally take her to the vet and get her checked out and he will tell u everything u need to know|`|ayfAU3vqaa	I'm not trying to be funny, but go get the book, "Dog Breeding For Dummies", there's a lot of great tips in there.|`|cf8a7ea39a18fe09933d45e8acd9f10faa	Why didn't you have her spayed??? Didn't you think something like this would eventually happen?<br>  <br>  Having puppies is a natural thing for dogs. She won't be "too stressed." Think about the pain she'll have from a c-section and then little puppies crawling all over her! Also, she'll learn better mothering instincts if she's allowed to give birth and clean the puppies and whatnot.<br>  <br>  Get that male neutered NOW!|`|f64sR36aaa	i would ask a vet for answers about you questions. take her to the vet and get her checked out to see how many puppies she has in her. then if you dont want it to happen again get her spayed|`|vXdTAD2Saa	well do u let her in the house? cuz if u do u would have SO noticed blood and (i know this is gross but) when dogs PMS they can't get pregnant until the second week of the cycle...they only have them twice a year for 3 weeks at a time<br>  if u didn't notice any blood then u shouldn't have to fret but u should take her to the vet for that clear liquidy stuff...<br>  hope i could help!

8b4985d6dcd90cd3df25afd6db14e88eaa	A veternarian specializing in exotic pets will be able to help you.<br>  <br>  Deafness is common in ferrets, blindness not so much. Why do you suspect it is blind?<br>  <br>  ADDED: Often when ferrets come from pet store they are bad,bad bad. I know that was the case with my boy who I had to nip train for quite a while. <br>  <br>  It may be the case that your ferrets have differing personalities, although i have never heard of a ferret being cross-eyed. I would definatly see a vet, as staring in to space is a sign of other disorders like insulinoma. Do you know the age of your ferrets?  Also, what colour are they? Do either of them have a white stripe down thier forehead?|`|0eb6dbb95deb5e1d8bef1919e15383e3aa	Ferrets in general have very bad eye sight.  Sometimes people can have thier ferrets for a very long time and not even realize that they are blind.  It is very possible that your ferret is blind.  From what you said, it does sound like you might have a blind ferret.<br>  <br>  As far as care, there shouldn't be a huge difference.  Like I said, ferrets have really bad eye sight to begin with, but the have excellent smell and hearing.  If your ferret is blind, then when handling your ferret you may need to be more gentle.  If you just go and grab him/her, she/he might get startled and end up biting you on accident.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|b951a8249f6f70b3277132b20e4630eeaa	Ferrets with a white stripe on their face or a fully white head, primarily blazes, badgers, and pandas, almost certainly carry a congenital defect known as Waardenburg syndrome. This causes, among other things, a cranial deformation in the womb which broadens the skull, causing the white face markings but also partial or total deafness and/or blindness. It is estimated as many as 75% of ferrets with visible Waardenburg signs are deaf or blind<br>  <br>  <br>   What color is your ferret?<br>  Also, if you got your ferret in a pet store and not from a breeder, there is a very good chance it is a Marshall Ferret, right? If it is, then the entire Marshall farm has been accused of accidental inbreeding, which (in ferrets) could cause several health issues such as blindness, as well as early weening and early seperation from the mother (which could cause stress and behavoiral issues, as well as health issues due to the baby not getting the needed nutrients from mother's milk)|`|c48ee26c1483e100abbde065019f7ffaaa	What do you think?|`|efeb102f889460f82f1bca109ae90bb0aa	Ask your local vet- and fast!|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Good choice to see a vet.

bbeAS9jlaa	Try using a good quality oatmeal shampoo for dogs and a light conditioner. There are several good ones at the pet store to choose from. I bath most shih-tuz and Malts about every month or so unless they are real dirt dogs. Mainly you need to keep up with the combing them out. Since the dry winter air make the skin and hair dry out use a light conditioner to prevent static. The #1 reason dog mat up in the winter. If your not sure ask your groomer what they use. We want your dogs to be happy and clean!<br>  DF|`|12048d8f757f7c0f475740cda5351342aa	We have shih tzu mix and give him a bath 1-2 times a week depending on what mischief he's been up to.

Not, a dog has a hair coat.<br>  <br>  If you do not bathe a dog at all, the skin is not going to dry out.  When you bathe a dog however, you are washing away the animals natural moisturizers.

If so, they'll need to go to the groomer every 4-6 weeks anyway. They can be bathed at that time. If they are bathed with a good quality dog shampoo, and rinsed thoroughly, they should be fine. There is also doggie conditioner, which may be a good idea for this little ones.<br>  <br>  In between baths, make they are brushed at least twice a week. The brushing will ensure that there are no mats, but will also spread the natural oils in their scalp.|`|rGlJ2FbUaa	Dogs don't require frequent bathing like we do.  Daily brushing will remove dirt etc and spread the dog's oils through it's coat keeping it shiny.<br>  But eventually they need a bath so use a proper dog shampoo (and detangler condtioner if you like).

VBiyKDk7aa	the pic is hard to see, but if he is black and tan in the same way as a doberman, ie tan points on legs, eyebrows etc, then he is a phantom poodle.

En el caso de la cola, el corte se realiza a los diez días de nacido el cachorro, y NO TIENEN MAYORES CONSECUENCIAS, APENAS LES DUELE Y NO SANGRAN. Pero en el caso de las orejas, la operación se realiza alrededor de los tres meses de vida, depende la raza, e implica sufrimiento y mayores riesgos.<br>  Como dato adicional, quedan hermosos con las orejas enteras. Un abrazo.|`|1oF5a1Oqaa	Si, no ara mucho se le cortaban las orejas,pero ahora,aqui en espa?a a salido una ley que prohibe las mutilaciones,porque esto es una mutilación.Al principio se les veia extra?os ya que siempre llebavan la cola y las orejas cortadas,y no se identificaban como la raza del boxer.Pero ahora todo esto ya a pasado y la verdad estan más guapos y no tienen cara de tan agresivos.<br>  Saludos|`|37d2a4393627e16239daa3c66266bd2faa	Si tiene hasta 3 meses y es para competición sí.<br>  Les dan anestecia total y lleva varios meses de tratamiento para que el cartílago quede "parado".<br>  <br>  Si no tiene pedigree y es mayor de esta edad, no te lo aconsejo porque no siempre quedan bien.<br>  <br>  ME|`|OJR8gQbaaa	te dire algo si sel cotan las orejas pero si quieres atu cachorro no lo lastimes haciendo eso no le agas lo que no tegustaria que te hicieran ati ya mucho sufrio con su rabo ademas los boxer se ven graciosos con las orejas sin corta|`|QcL7lfPfaa	hola no es que sea obligatorio y el que no se las cortes va a dejar de ser un boxer, por estetica y las caracteristicas de la raza se le cortan las orejas y el rabo pero depende de eso depende de que si tu quieres o no cortarselas, nadamas no dejes pasar mucho tiempo por que entre mas cachorros es mejor.|`|Zvafizpyaa	a la raza boxer ya no es necesario cortarle las orejas , antiguamente se hacia pero en la actualidad  se prefiere mutilar lo menos posible , en cuanto ala cola si se corta por que en el boxer se da con frecuencia colas muy retorcidas que le restan esteticamente|`|ev6L3aJSaa	si, tienes que pedirle a un veterinario que le corte las orejas y... esa es mi respuesta =)|`|b3b2d4344ecd601119cabc6599999f9faa	Mira, tu piensa si te gustaría a ti que te cortaran las orejas para que quedes mas guapa...

A fly larvae still has to breathe, so if you drop liquid soap onto the scabby part, and wait, the larvae should exit the hole in the skin in order to breathe. You just grab the larvae with a pair of tweezers and pick it out of the hole (gently so that it doesn't break). <br>  <br>  The good thing is, there should be only one fly larvae per hole.<br>  <br>  I have never heard of a dog getting chicken pox or shingles, or the doggy equivalents thereof. They can get scabies (or mange), which presents somewhat as you described. But since he was seen by a vet who couldn't identify the problem as such, then I doubt if this is scabies. <br>  <br>  I ultimately have absolutely no idea what this could be. <br>  <br>  Did you try the soap trick?|`|0xJZJggVaa	It is more likely a rash. He could be having an allergic reaction to something in his environment. It could be anything from fertilizer to something he ate.

d86397c5741ce75598fa744b94b9a6bbaa	If your cat bit the centipede or got stung, I would strongly suggest calling a vet.  I've never had this experience, but I've seen kids get stung by them and they were rushed to a hospital before symptoms set in.  If he simply played with it and you caught him before he bit it or got stung, I think you'll be alright, but check his body for any stings and check his mouth.  If you see something funny in his mouth, like his tongue or cheeks look inflamed or he has trouble eating or drinking, take him to a vet quickly.  I'm not sure if ingesting part of a centipede can poison him, but if his mouth looks irritated, I wouldn't take the chance.  Hope this helps.|`|1879eba1bddd18b4bdfb0dd3b595d27caa	I'm not entirely sure, so sorry that I'm not of much help, but just keep her with you at all times for the next couple of days and keep a very close eye on her.

28c9b72d5e6caeb12d6f5e323829cb7eaa	The animal may change eating habits but not sleeping habits. The symptoms could be quite subtle. The only way to tell if a dog has rabies is to cut off its head, and there really is no cure. So your best bet is to pray he doesn't have it and keep him quarantined until you know for sure (the dog will die in less than 10 days). <br>  <br>  And I quote:<br>  <br>  There are three phases to the course of the disease: prodromal, furious, and paralytic. Death occurs three to-seven days from the onset of signs.<br>  <br>  The prodomal stage lasts two-to-three days. The signs can include behavioral changes, fever, slow eye reflexes, and chewing at the bite site.<br>  <br>  The furious stage lasts two-to-four days. During this stage, signs of erratic behavior may include irritability, restlessness, barking, aggression, vicious attacks on inanimate objects, and unexplained roaming. Disorientation and seizures may also develop.<br>  <br>  The paralytic stage lasts two-to-four days, during which signs of paralysis develop, usually beginning in the limb that was bitten. Paralysis of the throat and face cause a change in the bark, drooling with typical foaming at the mouth, and a dropped jaw. These signs are followed by depression, coma, and death from respiratory paralysis.<br>  <br>  Once clinical signs develop, there is no treatment.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	I read one that was outstanding.

I would loose the Apple Cider Vinegar as well.  Dependant upon the horses age, wetting down horse food is not necessary UNLESS you have older horses.  Horses do best on fiber diets and low nutrients.  To many, this seems a bit odd, but this is how they evolved.  Hays work best.  If your horses have problems with the hays, you can always get a product like beet pulp to help out.  Beet Pulp is high in fiber.<br>  <br>  I think it is great that you are wanting to care for the horses and give them the best food possible, but you can over do it, which seems to be happening here.|`|26959a2082d4badc9dd0164daae5e30aaa	In all fairness to your budget, most horses, even eventers don't need all of that. <br>  <br>  The Omalene is a terrific feed.

Everyone else started saying...I am not kidding...<br>  <br>  "I didn't think to much of this horse when you brought her home but now I see what you saw. She looks great!!" <br>  <br>  Check with your trainer, or call one, most of them don't feed their horses a $300 a month supplement diet. <br>  <br>  Sometimes we go over board when just staying on board will do.<br>  <br>  Kiss her for me!|`|0dce3040f633ed577bc5837dc66d6611aa	What you're doing is actually good if your going to fed supplements. The water and apple cider will help the powder stick to the feed so none is wasted. No there will not be any mixing or less effectiveness in your supplements. If you read the packaging it will actaully say to use water or a sticky substance like apple cider to help the suplements stick to the food. If you're putting your horse on $300 worth of supplements make sure they're needed. If you're using a formulated feed then you probably don't need all this. If you're using cosaquin then you don't need MSM as cosequin is enough. I'd need to know more about what you're feeding and more about your horse to help you formulate a good diet. Good luck, hope this helps.|`|19a16fd526f17ef5281ba84b9310daa2aa	Feed is feed, when your horse eats it, it will get everything it needs. You must do a lot of work on that horse to be giving him sooo much stuff. But all that mixed together will not compromise or adverse the affectiveness of any of it. But if he doesn't do that much work, I suggest slacking off, on some of it, because it makes more work for his liver to sift through all of that stuff. Also to maybe make it more enjoyable to the horse, use hot water and make it into a mashy kindof feed. I'm surprised your horse will eat everybit of that.|`|AA11265363	No worries, it won't become useless or anything. apple cider vinagar aids digestion and it does nothing harmful, and water will just make it soggy. it's like putting milk on corn flakes - they're still corn flakes, just easier to eat.<br>  <br>  Natasha is definately right though! Be careful with how much you give him! His liver and kidneys can only sort through so much! I promise you, horses don't need to be babied as much as they are.

d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	Sadly, there are some people who simply can't bring themselves to ending their dogs suffering, because they can't see being without their beloved pet.  I knew a woman with a dog that was so bad, that it couldn't walk at all, was entirely deaf and blind, and she would carry it around... which wasn't any better, as this caused pain to the dog as well.  She just could not see being without this dog and bring herself to putting it to sleep.  <br>  <br>  Maybe this person you are referring to here has never experienced an aged pet and the discomforts they go thru to understand your situation very well.|`|c0f46f82e2e9e94b7f54e6854e7c8b90aa	This is Yahoo ANSWERS, not Yahoo RESPONSES.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Does this belong to the animal yahoo answers?
c21d0003bc4cc7e4b99196c5d509dbd7aa	Don't worry this is natural for her not wanting to pick up her feet. She may be 'freaking out' though because of what someone might have done to her, so this is a game of trust. <br>  <br>  As long as this is not pain related, take her into a round pen and let her stand at liberty. I'm assuming you have a good relationship with her and for the most part she's soft and gives to pressure. If not, hire a professional trainer to help you with that. Otherwise, have her stand at liberty in a round pen. Have a rope or lunge whip at hand. Now walk around her, but don't give her any cues to follow. Walk around and gradually get farther away from her.<br>  <br>  If she ever takes a step, make her trot around the pen a few laps then bring her back to the middle. This may take a few times before she gets it. Now approach her gently (if she moves make her trot) and greet her by letting her sniff your hands. Without leaving her body, skim your hand along her neck and to her shoulder. It's important your hand is always touching skin so she knows it's you. You could say you're being 'polite'. But in return you want her respect.<br>  <br>  Stroking her shoulder, skim your hand slowly down her leg. If she ever moves, make her trot around the round pen. Remember when you bring her back to start over, let her sniff your hand. Get farther and farther down her leg until you're at her hoof. It's very important you remain relaxed, because if she senses you're nervous then this will cause her to move, and you don't want to discipline her for that. <br>  <br>  Ask her to pick up her hoof calmly. If she moves or leans in/towards you, immediately send her away into a trot. Keep repeating this until she leans away from you. she doesn't even have to lift her foot, just as long as she gives and leans away. Stop and praise her. Repeat the process, asking for an inch more each time. Release pressure when she leans away and tips her hoof. Eventually she'll bend her knee and her hoof will begin leaving the ground. Remember to release pressure and praise her each time she gives you a little more. <br>  <br>  Keep asking until she totally lifts her hoof off the ground. Pet her, and praise her. Now the fun part is to repeat the whole process for the other three feet. It should go much quicker though. Next time you work with her, try holding her feet. Gradually you'll be able to hold each of her feet for as long as you'd like.<br>  <br>  Good luck hope all goes well. ;)|`|0e33fe96a2a4aa4d52b7de8205120b68aa	try join up. u put the horse on a lung line or in a round pen.  u make her run around and around until her inside ear is focused on u.  then stop her and make her go the other way until she lowers her head and licks or makes chewing motions.  then stop her,  drop the rope (if he used a lung lline), turn your back on her have ur eyes and head downward. walk around a little and she should follow u.  she should choose to be with u in the center and want to cooperate, and trust u.   she knew she couldn't out do u see she then sees u as her protecter and leader.  maybe this will help you?  this is a technique wild horses used to show dominance and leadership.  if it takes a while and she seems to tire, keep going.  she will soon figure it out.  it is amazing how this works, and maybe try to do it more than once before u try to touch or pick up her feet.|`|534dcebfacc6ec55271d063b638a9af3aa	U have to try to teach her that being by u wont hurt her.What u have to do is start by touching the tops of her legs then giving her a treat and leaving for the day or for an hour.Then go lower and lower but over 2 weeks so she learns u won't hurt her.Good Luck|`|AA10601780	It takes some patience but start brushing her legs and trying to pick them up everyday.

Neither have ever been shod.  It sounds like you have a minature horse and they shouldn't be shod.  You are going to have to start out with two people unfortunately.  One person that stands in front of the horse holding it's halter and giving it treats or something else to distract it while the second person deals with the feet.  One of these horses I tried an experiment with.  I decided to bring the whip out and place it directly in front of him so he could see it.  He went from a total terror to a very quiet and submissive horse.  Both of these horses have improved remarkably since I have had them.  They still have quite a ways to go, but they are much better.  I also had serious bathing problems with these two horses as well.  This has also improved remarkably.|`|e0d145f04b891aa09fb8e501900f354caa	go to Downunder Horsemanship.com and get a video or book by Clinton Anderson....I have seen him address this very problem with awesome results!!!!!......good luck with your new horse

gqjrBmu1aa	You should probably consult your vet and make sure that your horses vaccinations are UTD. Your vet may choose to run an allergy test on your mare- but if an allergy is found it is very easy to maintain. If it seems to be feed related make sure that you are regularly doing the following-<br>  <br>  Washing and drying out feed bins in between new bags of feed. (this is important cause feed can mold and cause your horse to break out)<br>  Make sure your feed bins are always shut tight.(wild animals love feed, especially rodants, and they can transport disease to your equine)<br>  Make sure your feed is stored seperatly from your hay supply. Alot of barns and people will sprinkle lime and other chemical powders to prevent hay mold and help preserve the hay longer.<br>  If you heard about the outbreak down in San Antonio last year where 15 barn horses died and everyone thought it was the feed Strategy that killed them- it wasn't Strategy is safe...the hay was being sprinkled with a chemical powder that is harmful to horses if ingested right after dispensing.|`|832d5ee83428117e771bb136d0bb5a19aa	Have you brought her to a vet?  This is a potentially serious problem, and can get worse quickly.  If she's having some kind of allergic reaction it could become systemic (thru her blood stream) and potentially kill her by suffication.  I'm not trying to scare you, but you need to take this seriously and have a vet evaluate her. <br>  <br>  Kris (owner of 4 horses)|`|c30e357dc08936fcbb857846e91542f6aa	If the horse started to develop this when you moved, I would suggest that the horse is allergic to something in its new environment. Maybe she is allergic to the type of grass? Maybe the fertilizer used? Maybe the water the barn uses? Or even something as simple as a new strain of dust at the barn (or mold) that she's never been exposed to. <br>  <br>  All of that can cause allergic reactions in horses.<br>  <br>  You NEED to get the vet out there. Allergic reactions and hives can cause animals to go into anafalactic shock (sp) and stop breathing or having heart abnormalities, etc. <br>  <br>  Hives are uncomforrtable for people, to say the least. And we get the luxury of benadryl or calamine lotion! Horses don't have that.<br>  <br>  GET your VET to the barn ASAP!|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	See if the vet can do some allergy testing.  It appears like there is something in Las Vegas that she is allergic to.
kgwpvJMoaa	There are five different species of hamsters commonly kept as pets. The largest is the Syrian hamster. Pet stores often come up with creative names to get more money for them. They will name them- Panda Bears, Teddy Bears, Black Bears, Honey Bears, Hershey Bears, Polar Bears, Goldens, etc.. Don't be fooled by the different names, they are all the same species. There is no difference in temperment just because they're different colors.<br>  <br>  Then there are three dwarf species, Campbells Dwarf, Winter White Dwarf and Roborovski Dwarf. Any other name is incorrect. Many pet stores don't even know what they're selling. There are differences between each of the dwarf species.<br>  <br>  Finally there is the Chinese hamster. Many people will call it a dwarf hamster but it's not.<br>  <br>  Below is a link to the Pet Website. It describes in detail the different species. There is also a hamster forum where you can ask specific questions to hamster owners and experts.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend you do an internet search for hamster breeders in your area. Hopefully there are some. Type "hamster breeders (state)" or "(state) hamster breeders" or "(state) hamstery". There are also lists of breeders on Hamsters Galore and the Internet Hamster Association of North America.<br>  <br>  A breeder will be able to tell you about the species they breed and can help decide if it's the species for you. A breeder will not charge you more for one color over another. A reputable breeder will be a member of the Internet Hamster Association of North America.<br>  <br>  -Janice<br>  www.holmdenhillhaven.com|`|AA10471121	do a search under wikipedia for hamsters I just saw the site they are all there.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	You might want to go to a hamster website.|`|389c7ca909ed8e7d45814f58d66fe8bbaa	Actually there are only 2 types of hamsters - Syrians and Dwarfs.

AA12185767	Hi there!<br>  <br>  It sounds like he has anxiety/panic attacks when he is in the car. Believe it or not, this isn't too uncommon with cats. The noise of the car, the new and unfamiliar space and the uncertainty of what's going to happen all contribute to your cat's behavior when he's in the car. There are a few ways you can lessen the traumatic experience for your kitty. Try getting a cat carrier (a plastic one with the metal door that they can see out of it just fine) and placing a few of his favorite toys and a blanket that smells like him inside. Sometimes cats feel more secure and safe when they are confined to a carrier during a car ride. Also, try sitting in the back seat with him (if someone else is able to drive) and talking to him in a soft voice while petting him through the carrier door. If he feels secure in the carrier, you will add to that security by talking to him softly and petting him---it is a sense of comfort in an unfamiliar place. If these suggestions don't work I would suggest talking to your vet about it. Sometimes if cats can't be calmed down by other techniques, a veterinarian will prescribe a mild sedative. It's usually in pill form and you give it to the cat about an hour before the car ride. It will make them drowsy and relaxed, and will wear off (depending on the dosage) between 1-3 hours after it kicks in. Hope this helps, and good luck!! :)|`|2a7bfedd529d64d55e216a90bb921c42aa	no more car....that is a sign of a cat being car sick.  he's meowing in pure pain of his stomach is doing flips.<br>  <br>  a few of my cats over the years have had this same issue.<br>  <br>  also ditch the leash and all.  1.  cats are suppose to be walked like a dog  2.  if you need something for home to car for a vet visit, get a cheap cat carrier.  Not safe to have a cat running around in a car anyways.  Can easily cause you to have an accident and cats don't wear seat belts...no cat will live through a car crash.|`|7721450c7de8275613e89c3d10a20f41aa	Put him in a carrier.  And only take him in the car when it's necessary... not just for "fun" since it's obviously stressful for him.  Some cats love car rides, others hate it.  I have both.  I also had a cat that would wet himself if I put him in a carrier, but did FINE if he was just on his harness & leash in the car.  One of the cats I have now does okay if she IS in a carrier but freaks out and flattens out onto the floorboard if she's loose.  My other cat loves to just lay on my lap (he's the only one I take on unnecessary trips, since he likes it so much).|`|190e68a519213984318164124f75a941aa	Get crate and put their bed or something like a blanket they're familiar with. The crate may give the cat some idea that they OK rather than being in the open in the cab of your car. Our cat did the same thing. We drove accross country and she evenyually calmed down. She didn't really have a choice.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Try slowly introducing it to the car.

Have you tried that  feline de-stressing air spray? It has worked pretty well for the short term for me. It could be the sound of the car stressing him out or the movement...or any number of things. Another possibility is to try to have him ride in a cat carrier, (your question makes it sound like you have him out on a leash still wile in the car) he might feel more secure.|`|e982357c8db1d25272ebc7fe0b822d7faa	the thing is a car isn't a stable surface and cats usually don't like surfaces that move so i would only take him when nessasary and maybe hold him  to calm him down  a little he wont ever over come his fear sry  :(|`|jhnsUAb7aa	UMMM................your cat sounds like a dog and is just acting like a cat should. Why would he like it???? Honestly a leash?? Atleast get a pet carrier ya know. Your poor cat is just too afraid to go out into public with you. You treat it like a dog i guess|`|szvLBM8Laa	You should just sit with him in the car and dont turn on the engine. Once he is used to the feel of the car then try turning on the motor. You might also want to get some blankets for him or a toy to distract him. You should also have a pet cage to put in your car so that the cat doesnt feel like it is in this huge tin can. They feel better if they are in one of those things. <br>  Hope I could help<br>  -Hamster

exC6mn3jaa	As far as I know, vets are not very well paid considering the cost of their education.  The vet school near me requires a 4-year undergraduate degree in a science field in order to be considered for admission.  Vet school itself takes at least another 4 years and is very, very expensive.  But if being a vet is really what you want to do, don't let that stop you.  Most of the vets I know seem very happy and satisfied with their line of work.  <br>  I currently work part-time as a vet assistant, and it is a very fun and rewarding job, although it can be difficult at times.  For me, the best perk is being able to work around animals all day, and always have new, interesting things to do.  The biggest drawback is you often see a lot of very sad things like abuse and neglect.  It can also be rather hazardous - I get bitten and scratched nearly every day.<br>  My best advice to you is to get a job as a vet tech when you are a little older, or volunteer at a shelter to see how you like it.  Some clinics and shelters require you to be board certified, but there are some that will hire people without certification to help restrain animals and draw vaccines.  If you like the work, go for it!<br>  <br>  P.S.  You have a really great website!  Keep up the good work!|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	If becoming a veterinarian is what you want to do because you enjoy working with animals, then you should become a vet.  However, if you want to become a vet because of the money, then you should look for a different type of work.  Money should only be secondary when deciding to become a vet.  If you do well as a vet, you will make more money.  If you are not a good vet, you will make less.|`|3b703017e6492c7a2c0eab5709862fe4aa	Hi.  Vets make around $150,000 to $200,000 per year depending on what type of clinic they have and what specialty they pursue. Small animal clinics do wonderful with dogs, cats etc. Some specialize in horses etc...just depends on what you want for your future clinic.  Get to know the vets in your neighborhood and maybe offer to volunteer a few weekends a month & you'll get a great idea of all that they do.  It's a wonderful profession and I hope you & your friend keep pursuring your dreams.  Good luck & many blessings, Patti|`|Gh5zshNoaa	I used to work for a vet-school and I can tell you that vets don't make what they are worth.  They invest close to half a million dollars for their entire education and most come out of school making $60-80K a year.  It takes them 30 years just to pay off their education.  It's a shame modern society finds it ok to pay MDs over $100K and year and don't want to do the same for their animal doctors.|`|d07e8034fa0de1831dbb99da5cf5dc0faa	To become a vet you now have to get into University and take 2 years of a science program and take the MCAT before you can apply to Vet school which is then another 4-5 years depending on if you want to specialize or not. <br>  <br>  Starting salary is usually around $60,000/year. You can make up to $200,000 if you have your own clinic but it's a lot of work.<br>  <br>  Depending on what type of vet you would like to be, large animal, small animal, etc your hours can vary durastically which can be a drawback, especially if you would like to become an equine vet. <br>  <br>  Having your own clinic is a huge responsibility. I personally would suggest working for other clinics and maybe becoming partners with people who have experience in running the clinic and dealing with things like the pharmaceutical companies, etc. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps in your decision! Being a vet is a great profession and is very rewarding!

f6e5ec5cff80a9bf50c9fb472d78a2c8aa	Adoro los Beagles, mira estos perros son sabuesos, criados para perseguir presas en el campo. Esto los convierte en perros energéticos, independientes, extrovertidos, y a veces tercos, ya que siempre quieren perseguir hasta lograr el objetivo y no hay diferencia en temperamento entre las dos variedades de beagles (13 o 15 pulgadas).<br>  Los beagles fueron criados y mantenidos en jaurías esto los convierte en genéticamente predispuestos a la compa?ía. Si no la tienen de otro perro, la demandarán de ti. Es interminable la lista de cosas que los beagles han masticado, comido, o destruido! Por haber sido criados así, generalmente se llevan bien con otros perros, e incluso, con gatos.<br>  Los beagles no son aptos para vivir fuera de la casa, y muy especialmente si solo tienes uno. Nuevamente, necesitan mantenerse ocupados y si se los deja solos en el jardín, lo habitual es que caven, ladren, y busquen maneras de salirse y divertirse. Si te dedicas a pasearlos por la ma?ana y pasar mucho tiempo con ellos antes de ir al trabajo y cuando regresas a la casa, deberían poder pasar el día en un jardín cercado. Y son bien comelones, quizá por que son hiperactivos y gastan mucha energia pero son HERMOSOS.  Pero en fin, los beagles adoran jugar, y son perros felices, y siempre y cuando entiendas su personalidad pueden ser una gran adición a tu familia.|`|2e99a02696aeadeb636dbb381a2e4394aa	si es normal mi  ex perro se comio el cable de la tele y el del lavarropa y se comio las patas de la mesa ,eso si jamas te sentiras sola|`|3de980733052a5d5eca8c88aa0271329aa	un perro no importa la raza el color o lo que sea siempre va a ser un perro de todas maneras si ves que te preocupa llevalo a un veterinario adiós|`|Vbi9fYKDaa	Es super tipico que sea hiperactivo, te lo digo porque yo tb tengo una beagle, y son muy chistosos pero destrozones y ademas comilones, si tiene al schnauzer entre ceja y ceja, pues dejalo, siempre va a ser asi, son muy perseverantes, te comento, mi Maia ya tiene 6 a?os y es super inquieta igual, te recomendaria que lo saques a correr, 1 o 2 km, la mia corre 12 pero creo que con 1 o 2 para empezar se va a tranquilizar un poco y vas a tener un perrito feliz|`|c45c806a120d0860e1aa2805de521be4aa	Yo tengo uno y la verdad es que es una trituradora.<br>  <br>  Lo que no es normal es que se pelee con tu otro perro, los beagles son perros de jauría, es decir sociables por naturaleza y carecen por cmpleto de agresividad, solo la usan en situaciones en que se encuentran amenazados.<br>  <br>  Creo que deberías llevarlo a un etólogo para que diagnostique su problema|`|rSHK8RZVaa	No te preocupes por que cualquier raza  puede hacer eso yo he tenido de todas las razas y me han roto todo depende del caracter que traiga el perro en sus genes, ya se le va a pasar tene paciencia|`|5CyZ2Jmlaa	Hahaha tienes a uno de los perros más hiperactivos del mundo canino.

No saben lo que van a hacer con él. Pero te cuento que el comportamiento es característico de ésta raza, no es que es sólo tu perro.
5CyZ2Jmlaa	Hola Obviamente el problema no es que este triste ni que quiera una pareja (eso seria bastante irresponsable) Lo que pasa es que, con el bajón de defensas que tuvo, la energía se concentró en curarse y no en seguir desarrollandose y, en tu caso, mantener el tejido de las orejas erguido. Yo creo que vas a tener que ponerle unos postes por algún tiempo, como los perros a los que se les cortan las orejas (gran danés, doberman, etc). Te explico una forma muy fácil de postear orejas: tomas dos tampones dentro de las orejas del perrito, luego las vas enrollando con micropore cuidando de no apretar demasiado. y al final refuerzas todo con cinta adhesiva. Tienes que cambiarle los poster una o dos veces por semana e interrumpirlo si las orejas comienzan a despedir un olor desagradable o secreciones (el olor a humedad es normal).

No es menos cierto que debes colocar un aereador, ya que éste posibilita el funcionamiento del filtro y al hacer ondular la superficie del agua del acuario esta toma oxígeno del aire.<br>  Los Guppys son los peces de acuario más prolíficos que existen.<br>  Pruebas de laboratorio demostraron que sólo un macho, peque?o. colorido y de gran cola, es capaz de embarazar a 100 hembras en un minuto.<br>  Se trata de animales ovovivíparos, esto quiere decir que las hembras, en lugar de colocar sus huvecillos en las plantas para que los machos los fertilicen, estas mantienen los huevos dentro de sí hasta que los alevinos (nombre que se le dá a los peque?ines) nacen.<br>  Generalmente, si éstos no tienen dónde ocultarse ya que nadan velozmente, son deglutidos por sus propios padres en un ciclo continuo.<br>  Si tu quieres conservar las crías no te queda otro remedio que comprar otro acuario, una vez que nacen pescarlas con una redecilla y pasarlas a la nueva pecera. En la tienda donde compras tus peces venden alimento para crias.<br>  De todos modos te diré que se trata del pez ideal para iniciarse en el acuarismo.<br>  Espero haberte sido útil.|`|4V3FYAUGaa	hola me gustaria ayudarte con tu pregunta pero no puedo pero aprovecho para darte saludos estoy en la sala de chats de yahoo en la sala de P.R.  no estoy como predicador sino como machadito26 es mi email|`|XIm4kzlAaa	creo que si|`|e30fe601ed8e4fadab265c793695e3b8aa	buena pregunta|`|8a1d566cd7d51fa4f35831a2ed6d2ca3aa	Hola yo tengo puros Guppyes en mi pecera. <br>  <br>  El tiempo de gestacion es depende de lo grande de la hembra, por lo general es un mes, mes y medio o hasta dos meses.<br>  <br>  Con respecto a lo de la sal, solo pide SAL para peces de agua dulce. En la caja viene especificado cuanto se le echa por cada litro de agua. De echo la sal es solo para prevenir enfermedades de los peces, sin embargo tambien es muy util, asi k te recomiendo k la compres, no es muy cara, una cajita sale en 10 pesos ( 1 dolar).<br>  <br>  Con respecto a lo de el filtro... Pues el filtro es para que dure mas limpia el agua de tu pecera, ademas es como si los peces estuvieran en su medio natural, hay varios tipos de filtro, yo antes tenia un filtro de plataforma, y el agua me duraba hasta 4 meses limpia. Ahora he comprado uno mas  sofisticado k tiene hasta na cascadita. Tu pregunta en el acuario y compra el k mas se acomode a tu acuario!!! Depende de los litrs de agua!!!!<br>  <br>  Si cuidas mucho a los guppies tendras muchos pecesines ya que se reproducen contantemente y ademas son muy faciles de cuidar ya que no son tan complejos y son los mas comunes.<br>  <br>  Cuando tenga a sus crias (que la mayoria ocurre en la noche) saca a los pecesitos o con una red en el mimo acuaro dejalos, esto es por k a veces se los comen. O pon flantas naturales dentro de tu acuario (preferentemente foltantes) para k cuando nascan los pecesines tengan donde resguardarse!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Veras k te encantara. A mi me fascinan los peces!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  SUERTE!|`|jm6bt1slaa	No necesitan mas que le pongas a su agua anticloro y azul de metileno.. para que no se mueran... y eso si vas a tener que comprar varias peceras por que estos peces se reproducen muy rapido... mi hermana tenia de esos y de dos llego a tener como 400..... suerte!|`|dfcd4962325a192c4968f9713bdb0e43aa	mira para saber cuando tu gupy esta embarazada hay un cambio muy drastico en su barrigita porque va a engordar muy rapido<br>  cuando ya valla a tener a las crias debes de ponerla en una especie de red en la cual es como de dos pisos y esta separada en dos en la parte de arriba ella se va a quedar para cuando tenga a sus peque?itos se vallan a la parte de abajo y a si ella no se los pueda comer en cambio si la dejas suelta en tu pecera a la hora de tener a los pecesitos se los van a comer tanto la mama como todos los demas y a los peque?itos los tienes que meter en una pecerita peque?a no hay nacesidad que tenga filtro puesto que se desarrollan muy rapido los pecesitos y les tienes que dar de comer unos churritos que te venden en los acuarios se los desbaratas muy bien y listo<br>  cuando tengan un tama?o medianito ya los puedes dejar en tu pecera de nuevo<br>  en cuanto a los neones si los puedes tener con tus gupys solamente que si esta mucho muy peque?ito el neon corre riesgos<br>  espero poder ayudarte!!<br>  =)

Estan a tu lado pase lo q pase y dan su vida por ti. Nunca se enfadan ni te critican ni te preguntan de donde vienes ni a donde vas, jamas juzgan. Cuando voy a jugar con ellos lo paso fantastico.Y a cambio solo te piden una caricia, y a veces ni eso.?Que humano hace todo eso?

Tambien es natural y bueno para ambos separarlos ya que deben crecer... La misma gata sentirá la necesidad de no amantarlos más y buscará un poco de independencia los gatitos lo superarán en menos de una semana quizás llorarán los primeros dias en el lugar donde fueran pero es la ley de la naturaleza, es importante hacerlo por ellos y por tu gata eso sí, ?A cuidarla! porque tienen un celo enseguida, entonces no esté tan fuerte quizás para afrontar un nuevo embarazo, es bueno la castración para evitar sorpresas y de todas manera también puedes quedarte con uno de ellos. el cari?o de tu gata pasará por como cuidas de ella y no por hacer lo que te parece humanamente una agresividad  por castrarla o un da?o al separarla de sus cachorros. Un gusto que siga  habiendo gente que ame a los animales y felcidades por esta bendicion cuídala, eso es amor tambien... besitos|`|qpKT6x7waa	si y alo mejor te come jajajajaa.............|`|jm6bt1slaa	No te odiara... tal vez ni siquiera lo recuerde... se sobreponen mejor de los que crees|`|W0fryqrkaa	Mi gatito tardó 2 semanas en abrir un ojo, el otro tardó menos.

It was a painful time but it was really worth it.<br>  She healed beautifully on her own and didn't require surgery.|`|yxO8yICOaa	Spend time with your cat. It will show him you care.

DLxh9CANaa	Your horse sounds as though he either has some sunburn, an allergic reaction to something he ate or came in contact with in the pasture or in the hay, or he has warts on his nose that have begun to bleed and scab over. For the first 2 problems, I would use a good sunscreen with plenty of UV protection on his nose and the lower part of his jaw and face. Sunscreen won't prevent the allergic reaction, if that is what is going on, but it will make the horse less vulnerable to the offending agent. For warts, about the only thing you can do is keep them clean and ask the vet about the possibility of cryosurgery to get rid of them.  There is one other possible cause that is worth mentioning- your horse could have vesicular stomatitis,or VS, which is an infectious, contagious disease caused by a virus. VS usually goes away on its own, but because it is easily spread from horse to horse, your horse should be kept isolated until the symptoms subside. VS produces symptoms like the ones you have described, so I would ask your vet what the likelyhood is that your horse has this.  Meanwhile, keep the scabby area clean and covered with sunscreen or block until you know what's going on. Hope this helps.|`|PNs4ySABaa	Is it hot where you are, and is he a light color? if so could be sunburn, also possible that he has tried to eat something and had an allergic reaction.<br>  <br>  If you can give him a good wash down round the area, and see if that helps. If he's eating OK and it isn't bothering him, then it isn't an emergency, sounds like you can keep an eye on it, and see how it goes.<br>  <br>  If it gets worse then call the vet to be safe, or if it isn't clearing up after a couple of days call the vet.|`|2bf23838a95610cfed45cc1253e50cdaaa	Go see a vet it'll be easier maybe his lips are dry or iz it a her?|`|jVW1w38waa	Is it possibly from the bridle...are you using a bit or hackamore? I would have the vet check your gelding out just to be absolutley sure there is nothing wrong with him. I really wish I could help, but asking the vet would be the really smart answer to this so nobody gives you the incorrect diagnosis.

Keep working with her....she'll eventually get it.<br>  <br>  Make sure you check the manufacturers labels before cleaning the persians, but you are going to want to get an enzyme remover for the areas where she has been going.<br>  <br>  Mine are both 5 years old and still not fully housebroken.  I have done extensive research and what I have been told is that small dogs are more stubborn and take longer to housebreak.  I have invested in a steam cleaner.  It makes my life much easier.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|p7swtBYzaa	Patience, patience, patience.    This is a young dog, and some take longer than others.   I have an 8 lb. dachsie that took a year to train - she's fine now, but boy was she stubborn.<br>  Do NOT scold or hit - just take her out to the same place and praise her loud and long when she does what she should.<br>  <br>  The carpet likely has the odor now - you can't smell it, but she can.   You need an odor neutralizer, not just a deodorant.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind, that some dogs will have accidents from time to time no matter what, but patience usually gets them trained.  Just don't scare her, all that does is make her hide when she poops indoors.|`|AA11592814	I know what you are feeling my mother has a morky (maltesse x yorkie) and she is a year old and still is not housebroken.|`|8f404450200704700dd9470519f07899aa	Wow. This is a very tough situation. I too just got a Yellow Lab puppy named Lilly and I had a very hard time training her. You just need to know the ropes. Are you yelling at her when she does not go in the right spot? Are you shoving her nose in the poo when she doesn't go in the right place? Don't do that. That will only discourage the dog and make it sick. When I was training my dog I had her go outside when she looked like she had to go. When she refused I would run around and she would chase me. When she got all tired out she finally went. Maybe this will work for you as well!|`|AA12134787	it took me several months to train my mini pinscher.she has to options to use my pinscher still uses puppy pads at night because there is no one to take her out.also what i did i took a few bells and tied it to some yarn make sure the bells are long enough to the neck.and then tie it to the door or back door then when you take it out take its paw and let it ring it then let it out.it make take a while.this is the only thing that worked for my dog.you could use puppy pads if you want.|`|JZdYJiCMaa	My puppy would do the same thing! I suggest spaying her. My dog would always go to the bathroom on the floor and after we got her spayed she automatically stopped going potty inside and went outside. It was amazing!|`|PCuLn5c5aa	Well in this case, maybe you should remove your persian rug for awhile and try to potty train her until she is able to understand that she cannot do her business there. There's also a spray at the pet store that helps potty train puppies. Other than that just make sure you keep an eye on your doggie and if she's squating getting ready to pee or poo just pick her up and hopefully she'll learn.

WGNomQEXaa	lol, it is a myth. PLEASE don't put your poor dog to sleep! And tell your friends they should do some research before making such ridiculous claims (although I must admit, it did make me laugh when I read it, hehe).<br>  <br>  I feed my dogs raw, often bloody meat, and whole raw bones! They have never, ever bitten. They won't bite when I groom them or cut their nails or express their anal glands. They don't bite when I pluck out their ear hair or anything. Neither dog has ever bitten a single time.<br>  <br>  Now, wild animals can carry diseases so if your dog appears to be at all sick, please do contact your vet asap and let them know he ate a squirrel. <br>  <br>  Raw, dead animals is the dog's natural diet. Pet food companies came on the scene less than a century ago and started campaigning to convince people that corn and fillers in a bag are much healthier than natural, normal food for them. Unfortunately, the dogs suffer from disgusting allergies, diabetes, obesity, and poor dental hygiene, to name a few. Luckily, there are at least corn and grain-free premium dog foods on the market that are world's better than some of those awful "original" dog diets (don't ever use anything from the grocery store if you value the health of your pet. Purina is garbage!). Check some of these out: Wellness Core, Evo, B.G. (Before Grain), Taste of the Wild.... Those are all the ones I can remember off the top of my head at 11:15 at night, hehe.<br>  <br>  Dog stomachs are insanely acidic compared to ours. That makes them immune to many bacteria that can make people very sick (such as salmonella). By feeding a dog raw bone, you naturally raise their stomach acids. The acids wear the bone down smooth and eventually completely dissolve it into dog doodoo. Don't ever feed dry-cooked bone, as the chemicals in it change from cooking and cause it to splinter and not digest correctly in their stomach acids, which can cause serious injuries in the stomach and intestines.<br>  <br>  Maybe your dog was trying to tell you he wants a raw diet? ;)|`|Qdnwocqbaa	This is just a myth. Many dogs have a strong prey drive, and will chase and sometimes kill small animals. This does not mean that the dog will ever hurt another dog, or a person. Think of all the dogs who were bred specifically to catch rats or other small animals - dachshunds, rat terriers, jack russell terriers - this is not exactly a list of vicious man-eating canines.<br>  <br>  However, you need to be aware of your dog's prey drive and keep it away from small pets or cats. Be a responsible owner.|`|bPgvMO98aa	A lot of people can be wrong.  Your dog has a prey drive.  You're lucky that the squirrel didn't do any damage to your dog as they have a mean bite, but I wouldn't worry about your dog going psycho.  My terrier mix has an incredible prey drive.  She's hell on moles.  She's also one of the sweetest, most loving dogs you could ever meet.  Some dogs just have more of a prey drive than others.  Maybe take care when she's around cats and small pets, but sometimes a dog is just going to be a dog.|`|RtYkt3cAaa	its completely natural for your dog to kill something...that does NOT mean in any way shape or form that your dog will be an aggressive dog towards other animals or people. you shouldnt even consider making your dog suffer for doing something that is completely natural to a dog- it is not a human, or a monster...so dont treat it like it is. If you really do think you need to put your dog to sleep then you probably shouldnt be a dog owner in the first place.|`|9Ozu6kcOaa	Please don't jump to conclusions. Dogs are natural born hunters. One of my dogs, a purebred German Shepherd killed more than her fair share of squirrels, which upset me terribly BUT, she lived to be 13 years old and was never aggressive with any of us. And my shepherd/malamute/wolf mix, I used to give her a taste of the hamburger meat (just a pinch or two) before I cooked it and she lived to be 17 and never hurt a fly! In fact, she used to cuddle up to our 7 guinea pigs and let our ferret ride on her back without incident..<br>  There is no truth to this. You're dog won't just go berserk on you because it killed a squirrel. Unless the dogs temperament is unstable to begin with, I wouldn't put too much credence in this myth. |`|2oCZEsPEaa	Lol, no you don't have to kill your dog! Lot's of dogs will chase things it's instinct. My dog is  very loving and gentle. She sleeps with my 2 cats and is more scared of them than they are of her. One day we were in the garden and she saw a rabbit, she just chased it.

It is an instinct that is sleeping in the back of the brain of even the most docile lab.  Your dog killed a squirrel...a prey animal.  You look absolutely nothing like a squirrel, so why on earth would your dog suddenly think that he should kill you just because he killed a squirrel?<br>  <br>  Yes, this is a total myth.  And a pretty stupid one at that since anyone with a grain of common sense would never believe it.  Ever seen a dog eat a juicy steak...guess what, that's "blood" too!  And no one I know of would ever say "don't feed your dog steak because then he'll want more blood and start to attack people" (they may say not to feed your dog steak because it's people food and a lot of people believe that if a dog ever eats any kind of people food it's the end of the world...but not because they think it'll give the dog a taste for blood).|`|nooi0ldjaa	NO your dog is a hunter, its in your dogs blood, your dog is a animal<br>  it happens. theres no reason AT ALL to put your dog down just because she did what dogs do. its ok, dogs kill birds rabbits squirrels all the time...its ok<br>  <br>  DO NOT PUT YOUR DOG DOWN<br>  its ok...|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	that's a myth.after the dog kills a squirrel, he may want to hunt and kill other squirrels.That's all.|`|Dz5NN288aa	No, no, no.<br>  You wont.<br>  That is just a silly myth.<br>  <br>  Yay!<br>  :)|`|AA11860101	That is BS.

lj46HCfQaa	Lo mas probable es que con el tiempo aprenda. Pero lo que puedes hacer es, cada vez que lo saques de la jaula siguelo, si vez que va a hacer pis llevalo a la jaula rapidamente y premialo por terminar alli. Es tarea dificil porque no se puede ver bien, pero vale la pena intentarlo.<br>  Ademas te aconsejo que le compres o le hagas una caja que le sirva de banio y que pueda usar rapidamente, que sea comoda para entrar etc. <br>  Otra cosa que puedes hacer es dejar que tu conejo este por unos dias en un area pequenia con su banio, juguetes, etc. Veras que en unos dias aprendera a usar el banio solo y cuando lo sueltes al resto de la casa regresara a su lugar para hacer pis. <br>  <br>  Quiero aclararte, porque otra persona te escribio diciendo que los conejos no pueden aprender a hacer trucos o su nombre y esto no es cierto.

I have had problems with dirt floor just holding on to the ammonia before.  When you completely clean out his stall, spread the lime liberally under them so that it really has a chance to get to the ammonia.  You need to use this when you can leave the stall open for a day or so to really let it dry it out and soak it up.  You can buy it most places like home depot or Lowe's and even some feed stores.  I haven't ever had a problem with it in my stalls.  Don't use when you just hosed out the mats.  You need to apply it to the driest stall possible so that it really has a chance to dry out all of the bad stuff.

Jxl4rpFfaa	Yes, that is called a bubble nest. Male betta blow them when they are ready for a mate.<br>  <br>  Mating a betta is not a good idea unless you are prepared for 1,000+ baby bettas.<br>  And if you do decide to mate your betta, you need to be careful on how you do such. You need to keep the male and female betta separated after the spawning ritual and such.<br>  [[your male will basically dance for hours on end]]<br>  He will then wrap his body around the female and literally squeeze the eggs right out of her.<br>  <br>  Have fun, and be safe.<br>  If you don't keep an eye out, one [[if not both]] of the bettas used to mate will surely die.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thankies!<br>  <br>  <br>  [[save the wal-mart bettas!]]|`|gc2Dmofnaa	The bubble nest means it is happy. Do not bring it to a petstore to breed and do not breed it yourself. Bettas can produce more than 100 offspring. Do you have the homes/tanks for all those bettas? It is also a complicated process and you'll need lots of equipment and live food to feed the babies that is often not found in pet stores.|`|9WV2UBCNaa	I don't think that a pet store would "breed" your fish for you.

Most male bettas make bubble nests if they are relatively happy and healthy.  However, this isn't a sign that you should be breeding him.  Breeding bettas is a very costly, time-consuming hobby, and should only be done by the experienced aquarist.  In fact, most bettas that you purchase from a pet store are too old to breed anyway.<br>  <br>  The bubble nest isn't a cause for concern.  It's normal betta behavior, just like flaring.
LAl0eDPzaa	What are you feeding him specifically?  Older horses often do not have the capacity to either properly chew and/or digest the 'usual' foods fed younger horses.  He may need a senior feed, or a supplement like beet pulp to help.  Is he allowed to eat by himself, so others aren't running him off his feed?  When were his teeth floated?  What condition are his teeth in - good, bad?  What was he wormed with?  You may have to have a fecal done to make sure you're getting all the worms by using the right kind of wormer.  If you're in a colder climate, make sure he stays warm, such as using a blanket or turnout sheet.  |`|74HBMPduaa	Sometimes older horses have uneven wear patterns on their teeth making it difficult to chew and digest their food.  You  should probably have a vet out to float his teeth.  Also, you may want to consider feeding him a food like equine senior and possible adding a little water to make it a mash.  This will help him be able to chew easier.  Soaked beet pulp is another favorite for adding weight.  Vegetable oil is another good weight adder.  You can add up to a cup per feeding by mixing it in his food/mash.  If he is having trouble eating his hay, it could be due to tooth loss and wear patterns.  Consider feeding a complete feed or hay in a pelleted/cubed form.  You may need to soak them.  |`|oU3jsLKiaa	Your horse is old and  certain horses loose weight when they get old because there immune system is not as strong as others. I recommend feeding him senior feed and this other pellet feed called "New weight", it has a lot of nutrition in it and help horses gain weight. And make sure when you worm him you rotate wormer's because if not thats one reason why a horse will lose weight. <br>  <br>  I suggest<br>  - stall him and if you do not have a stall double blanket him in the winter and when it is cold<br>  -when it rains even if it is not winter put a rain sheet on hims o he does not catch a chill and get cold and sick.<br>  <br>  One reason he may be loosing weight is because he is old and his teeth are not as good and he is having trouble chewing his food.<br>  <br>  Good luck =] hope this helps|`|AA10572595	.I recently agreed to care for a very undernourished mare.The owners thought she was 8 years.But she was actually 18 years.The owners wanted to fatten her for a sale.I did not think she would make it.So first we wormed her (ivermectin) put her on good pasture,and grained 2x day .She kept separate from other horses ,because she was not strong enough to protect herself.In 60 days the mare really began to bloom.At 90 days she was healthy again|`|HTlxEjd9aa	What I would do is find other supplements to add to his food and mix it together. Also feed him more and don't over exercise him.|`|RloOJ43haa	He may need senior feed. It is made to be more easily digestible so that the horse can get more out of it. If you haven't already, get the vet to float his teeth, and get him de-wormed. You vet can also do a blood test to check for disesase or metabolic disorder. <br>  <br>  Also, a blanket would probably be a good idea in inclement weather. |`|RpZWaVomaa	Age has something to do with it I am no vet so I am quiet sure if you are conserned about it you should call your vet also look up progressive grass feed they have a food just for weight gain and one for muscle and weight gain you can look up your horses body score and they will tell you what food to feed good luck :)
djmqoFSTaa	Here are some of the Impressive...I didn't know what names were in your pedigrees...don't know if this will help you or not...<a href="http://www.qhd.com/horse/searchbloodline.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.qhd.com/horse/searchbloodline...</a><br>  <br>  Maybe you could type in the exact name on your pedigrees and it will help you find out...<br>  <br>  Okay...the Impressive link didn't come through...but you can click on the link I gave you...<br>  <br>  Put your mouse over "Stallion" in the menu bar...in the drop down menu, click on "find a stallion" and then you can select "bloodline".  Type in either Impressive or the exact names on your pedigrees.  Hope this will help you.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Once you do the research on the pedigree and say you find that a stud/mare combination doesn't have the gene, then nothing below that horse will have it obviously and you can stop at that point. And, it's not the AQHA or APHA "breed" that carries the gene, it's decendents of Impressive, so it can be present in any horse that has that bloodline. Three Bars did not "start" the gene, otherwise there would be tons of other decendents with it.|`|AA10572595	I have a quarter horse with Impresive breeding .My horse was DNA tested ,with negative results for HYPP.,and is recorde on reg. papers. Check on your papers.Check with AQHA.|`|jV7SmnaTaa	Well...it will say on their AQHA papers if they have been tested and what their results were.  If there is no descendents out of Impressive on their pedigree then AQHA doesn't require testing on them....otherwise, it says it on their registration papers.|`|UJ45vQn0aa	You can access the QH paper's on the internet. There should be an online studbook section, that would be a good place to start.<br>  But I would recommend that you have your horses tested if you are concerned.|`|5XUTHN15aa	Go on www.allbreedpedigree.com and type in his/her name and see if they are in the system it will give you their pedigree if they are in the system if they are not add them and see if you can find their mother/father|`|Uaz8lsNHaa	AQHA usually. It is an Impressive gene, so if you don't have that on the papers, you are probally good|`|kuwxKndCaa	Keri speaks True.<br>  The only breed affected by HYPP is the American Quarter Horse, and only direct descendants of Impressive carry that gene., and only 1 of 4 horses carrying that gene test pos/pos,  likely to pass it on.<br>  If your mares are registered with the AQHA,  it should show results on their papers as HYPP pos/pos, pos/neg. neg/neg.<br>  The AQHA's website has free search engines that you can access by your mares' names or registration #'s.<br>  <br>  As far as I know,  there's no fast way to tell, beyond a bloodtest.  There are lots of really GREAT horses that have some Impressive blood in them,  and it's not a death sentence for a serious breeder,  only a responsibility to that breeder to avoid passing on a gene that weakened a good breed.  The 'Impressive Gene', aka HYPP is actually being bred out of the American Quarter Horse,<br>  and only physically affected about 25% of his get.<br>  Hope this helped,  I have an incredibly great Impressive bred horse myself!|`|B6zl0AJDaa	AQHA.com has a pedigree area where you can look up pedigrees, however you need to be an AQHA member to do so.  With each search (They cost between $3-$15/ea) you can print them up and then double check each line.<br>  <br>  I have 3 mares (Well ONE mare and 2 fillies) all are Impressive bred and all are N/N.|`|AA12310378	DNA testing is quick, easy & cheap. <br>  <br>  It costs $40 or less and takes less than a week to get results from a few pulled mane hairs.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can track back along the pedigree too. If you find tested N/N all the way across a generational line your mares will be clear as N/N cannot pass HYPP along. Once tested N/N the AQHA allows testing to lapse so you may have to look a few generations to get to tested animals.<br>  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately HYPP N/H animals are still being bred from so the gene is still around.
AA11570905	Sure you can!  Why not?  You can get a lot of the water off his coat with a sweat scraper and then you can even use towels to soak up even more water should you ever need to hurry along the drying process.|`|zHz6FTRNaa	It seems your question has been answered already, but I'll add my two cents anyway.<br>  <br>  I makes sense that you can use a sweat scraper on a wet horse, no matter how the water/sweat got there! It still serves the same purpose.<br>  <br>  I think going over your horse with a towel as well is a good idea, which - depending on your horse - may take some desensitizing first. I don't know if I would go as far as to say blow dry the horse, it depends how wet he/she is I suppose, and I don't know about you, but I don't have all that many power points outside that I could get my horse near to.<br>  <br>  : )|`|EJgUAn4eaa	I do not think it would hurt. We use them after washing, I see no difference. If he isn't a spooky kind of horse, you could take a towel to him. Rub him dry. I would do both.....|`|vhi7vBy2aa	...Yes & use a towel :)|`|IMPvzBk1aa	for a very wet horse, start with the sweat scraper.  You really shouldn't put the saddle on a wet back, so you'll need to rag or towel dry the saddle and girth areas, and if your horse is okay with it, a hairdryer set on cool or not too warm will speed up the process.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Of course you can.  The scraper's function is to remove as much water from a horse's coat as possible before using other methods, such as straw or a towel/cloth.

paaozogGaa	SWIM BLADDER -<br>  <br>  is a disease very comonly found in the fancy goldfish species.  <br>  <br>  THE REASON-<br>  <br>  are you feeding your goldfish flakes or other floating foods? If so, that's your reason. You see a fancy goldfish has a curved spine which crams all of his or her digestive track together. When it goes to the surface it will take in air and then you have a problem because goldfish can't burp.<br>  <br>  THE CURE-<br>  <br>  Some have said to feed it a boiled de shelled pea right away. This may work but I have never gotton any of my fish to be able to eat it. Also petstores will sell medicine that may help cure swimbladder. Do they work? I have never had ANY luck with it. I personally would not feed it for a couple of days to attempt to let his system clear out. if all fails for your n ext goldfish get omega one goldfish pellets from Petsmart. Though they are kind of expensive, they are good quality and the fish love em!|`|eX8i4vwRaa	yeah probably :/ sorry|`|ZuRjSHq2aa	did you dechlorinate the water, goldfish tend to be pretty hardy even if the water is at toxic levels. Yes swimming at an angle is bad probably something wrong with swim bladder and going to the top for air is also bad. Does the tank have enough surface movement? Did you dechlorinate and do make sure it says on the bottle to use for the removal of chlorine/chloramine and not just a bottle of stress coat or what not. IF those are correct how is the water temp it should feel cold to the touch if none of these bring a sample of the water IN THE TANK to a pet store and ask them to test your water and come back here with the results (bring paper and pencil lol)|`|zLubPPgHaa	It's most likely your fish has a swim bladder problem. The swim bladder allows the fish to regulate how it moves and holds itself in the water, but letting out and taking in gas to give it buoyancy. If the fish has been knocked, it may cause damage and upset the fishes ability to balance itself in the water.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't like to say if it would die or not, but make sure it can feed and the other one doesn't bully it.<br>  <br>  I hope your fish pulls through.|`|CJNEZZXBaa	i dont know what is hapening to your fish, but, mine has been swimming like that for about a month and he is doing fine, dont worry too much, there is a pretty good chance your fish will survive.|`|hutoPgliaa	It sounds like a swim bladder problem.<br>  Oxygenate the water, though they often don't survive for long.|`|LGmmWs2Daa	Yup, mine started doin that yesterday and it died like 10 minutes later!!

KjoL7YBVaa	he sounds more like a malamute, he can be reg as long as they gave you his papers, you will be wasting time showing him as he will most likely be over the 50 pound weight limit, He'll most likey be a rather huge 28 inches really big for a husky and is closer to the size of a wolf mix, but if the parents have papers then the breeder should have given them to her by now any way. That'll be a cool dog never seen that big of a husky not sure how heavy he'll be. most dogs are about 70% done at that age mostly filling out and not so much getting taller|`|49f23ea17154ce0bf8bb3498da7b16ecaa	i have to registered huskies and I would believe so.Call or check the akc website.Normally,2 yrs.old.mine are 11/2 and still filling out.|`|QKkvReg6aa	Yes it can still be registered, the breeder should have registered litter and pup. Size only means that the breeder wasn't concerned with the standard. The fact that he is far too tall would only hurt him if he was in the conformation ring, or if someone wanted to breed to him.|`|TSgXRO82aa	Yes, he can still be registered, just not shown or bred. <br>  <br>  Most dogs stop growing around the age of 1. One of mine stopped at 1, the other at 1.5 years.|`|345067d84433b48f76b2fc03b0d36bf5aa	Registered, probably, but not shown or bred if he doesn't meet the standard.

wjJjthHvaa	From what I've read, the Oregon BLM that manages the Kiger mustang herds out in the wild, has an adoption for the general public every 3-4 years.  The most recent one was November of 2007, which means the next one will probably be in 2010 or 2011.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you may have to consider buying from a breeder.|`|AA12189965	i live in Burns Or. were one of the largest herds of kigers lives <br>  they do adopt them out but they only take from the kiger herd every few years right now the Corrals here have no kigers. they had some last year but they were all adopted the local ranchers around here like them becuse there sturdy.. contact the burns district BLM offices<br>  (541)573-4400 theres the Ph number|`|WpsPLKS7aa	I don't think you can adopt a Kiger...

E0HFmBIgaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I always make a list of everything I want in a horse and things that I don't. When I find a horse I am interested in, I will email about it. If that sounds good, I will call the owner. I will go down the list and ask them about the wants and concerns I have on my list.<br>  <br>  Another thing you could do when you finally find a horse you think you might like is to ask the owner if you could "lease" it for a month or two and see how you like it. I know that not everyone will want to do this, but you will want to know for sure that the horse works out and is right for you. If they won't do it, another thing you could do is show up unannounced and ask if you can see the horse and ride it again. If they don't want you to, chances are, they could be hiding something. I hate to be suspicious of people, but some people will even go to the lengths of drugging their horses to make a sale. I don't like the old saying that every horse seller is a liar, but sometimes you have to be cautious. Get a month or two lease if you can. That's what I would do.<br>  <br>  Another thing. There are horse head types. Did you know that? That means that you will be able to look at a horse and be able to tell within reason what that horse is like. I learned this when I was a young girl from a set of booklets I ordered. It has come in very handy over the years. Here are the head types. They can be a combination of 2 of them also, with one being the stronger type over the other.<br>  <br>  Type 1 is "Kind and willing". This horse has a flat forehead with eyes that don't protrude much. Have you ever seen an Arabian type head that has big beautiful eyes that look really alert? Well, the Head type 1 DOESN'T have eyes like that. They look calm and gentle like a does eyes. They don't get very rattled when something happens. These are the most willing horses and are great for beginners on up.<br>  <br>  Type 2 head type has what I call a "stubborn bump" right between their eyes on their forehead. This type is stubborn and willful. It takes them twice as long to train because of this, but when they finally "get it", they make good riding horses. You need to have more time, money and patience to train this type.<br>  <br>  Type 3 head type is also flat foreheaded, but has the big expressive, alert, protruding eye. This type is nervous and ambitious. Many Arabians, Morgans, and Saddlebreds have this type of eye. It is beautiful, but has MUCH energy. So depending on if you want English Pleasure or Saddle Seat, this type would be great for that. Many Arabs are known for long distance trail rides and can outlast others because they have the nervous ambitious head type and maybe the stubborness of Type 2 thrown in.<br>  <br>   There are a few combos I could describe to you. If you had a type 3 nervous and ambitious horse with some type 2 thrown in, in a good light, he could make a great endurance horse like I said, but if there was something that made him afraid, it would be hard talking him out of it because he has stubborness too. Do you see what I mean? <br>  <br>  We have a Shetland/Arab cross pony that is a type 2/type 1, in that order, and he is really stubborn and really mild and easy going. What does that equal? It's hard to get him going. He wants to stand around and eat.<br>  <br>  We also have a type 3 paint gelding.  He lives up to his head type.  He gets nervous in the trailer or show ring at times, and uses his ambition to keep it up. ( :  His nervousness and ambitiousness has also resulted in him windsucking for something to do when he doesn't know what else to do,---like when he has ran out of food.<br>  <br>  So, you now have some added info that I have found most people don't know about. You can go and look at horses and have some extra knowledge of what you are dealing with. Of course there is always the exception of the abused animal, etc.. that supercedes any head type. Abused animals are in a class all their own.  <br>  I also like to take a video of the horse being ridden by the owner too, and then have someone take it of me riding it to see how we look together. I then take it home and review it and think about it overnite if I need to. I'll also take the video and show it to some different horse experts to have added input. <br>  <br>  So have fun shopping for your new horse. You are wise to ask others for added tips. ( :|`|meyvIZVzaa	Some people like to get a vet check while looking at the horse, also test ride the horse to see if it is right for you. Also, don't buy the first horse you see (unless its EXACTLY what you're looking for) arange to look at a lot of horses that are sort of what you want and see them all to work out which one would be better suited for you. Also, you probs wont see your dream horse straight away, some people have had to search for 8 months to get their perfect horse.. Just be  patient and enjoy your new horse!|`|Y6xLu77aaa	I was in your shoes about 5 months ago, so I know how you feel. We didn't even go looking to by a horse at that time, they kinda fell into our laps. We have a mare and her foal. My advice would be to really look around and if you find one have a vet take a thorough look at the horse. Our mare at first was a big handful but once I figured out what to do she got alot better. We had the colt gelded a month ago and he became the sweetest guy ever, I was even able to halter brake him I hope you have alot of fun looking for your horse. It's a dream come true for me. God bless.|`|AA11144413	first pick up a book read a little theres a book out there i think for buying horse..idk i got one and i have the best horse in the world...<br>  but its all about what you like i look into the eyes and you just know!!|`|c7UXVyMHaa	With the economy on the plung people are dumping horses left and right.  We just rescued a beautiful 10 year old paint last Sunday.  So unfortunately, a lot of people are less than truthful about what they are selling right now.  The number 1 thing you can do to gaurantee you are getting a good horse is have an equine vet check him/her.  The cost is minimal less than $100 usually and worth every penny.  Then move forward from there.  Also, not to sound like a horse mercinary but the the federal goverment has 37,000 mustangs that need homes.  If you look up the website you can adopt for $25 and speaking from experience they are usually the most duarable horse you could ever have.  |`|qdtU1Q1Laa	When buying a horse, it helps to make a list of things that you want in a horse. Such as you want a horse over 15hh or you want a dressage horse. Don't look at horses that are just your favorite color, look past what they look like and get the best horse for you. Also when looking at a horse perhaps take a trainer with you. [[ if you have one ]] Don't settle for the first horse you look at; go look at a few before you decide which one you want. And before you ride, you should have the current owner and then your trainer ride before you get on. When you think you found the horse you want to buy, ride it more than once, and ask if you can take it on a trail to see how he/she is at your barn. Also be sure to get the horse a pre-purchase exam before you buy it as you don't want him/her to turn up lame in a few weeks!!<br>  <br>  Well I hope this helps and good luck buying your first horse! :)|`|cZGnqPhMaa	Make sure you test ride the horse and that you really conect and love the horse you are going to buy. I am not really sure what kind of advice you are looking for. Oh and congrats on getting your first horse I just got my first horse 2 weeks ago.
pH2WWg88aa	Hey,<br>  <br>  While housing lizards together is generally not too good, in the case of chinese water dragons- several house these creatures with other lizards successfuly.<br>  <br>  Chinese water dragons can go well with basilisks and sail fin lizards as they have same requirements, environment etc. However if you do house these lizards together make sure there is a lot of space and a lot of food so no one feels threatened and gets territorial!<br>  <br>  Here is some info on:<br>   basilisks<br>  <a href="http://www.sundialreptile.com/care%20sheet%20basilisk.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sundialreptile.com/care%20she...</a><br>  <br>  sail fin lizards<br>  <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/sailfin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/sailfin.html</a><br>  <br>  Whichever lizards you chose to have together please do not buy a majority of males to avoid fighting!

AA10449254	I have found the following excellent training tips by Vivian Bregman extremely helpful over the years in trainng 4 pet:<br>  <br>  CIVILIZE YOUR DOG<br>   <br>  For most dog owners the following three things are the most important for the dog to learn:<br>  <br>  1.  Housebreaking,<br>  <br>  2. Coming when called and<br>  <br>  3.  Walking on a leash without pulling.<br>  <br>  Everything else varies from owner to owner.<br>  <br>  The following are the most important things to remember when you start out to "Civilize Your Dog":<br>  <br>  1. NEVER tell your dog to do anything that he can evade. <br>  <br>  2. REWARD whatever you want the dog to continue doing while NOT REWARDING (or penalizing) whatever you want the dog to stop doing. <br>  <br>   These two statements will help you train the dog for the rest of his life.  Remember that rewards are not what YOU consider a reward, but rather, what the DOG considers a reward.  <br>  <br>  For example:  if your dog runs out the front door, he is being REWARDED with freedom.  When you call him and he comes and you put him back in the house he is being PENALIZED for coming to you by being put back in the house.  <br>  <br>  For training purposes a Reward can be verbal praise, petting, food, a ball or whatever motivates your dog.  YOU know your own dog -- you know if he would sell his soul for food or for a tennis ball.  Make his Reward whatever turns him on, and the time spent finding out what really turns him on will be well worth the effort.<br>  <br>  Please notice that I said "Penalize" and not punish.  Punishment makes people think of hitting the dog -- which is rarely necessary.  The only reason to hit a dog is for anti-social behavior.  "Anti-social" is not only biting.  A puppy that growls when you go near his bone is threatening you -- definitely anti-social behavior.  If not stopped it will probably become a bite.<br>  <br>  A "Penalty" can be anything that the dog does not like.  It may be a leash jerk, not moving when he's a on leash so there's no walk, or just ignoring him.<br>  If you think that your dog can't or won't learn, think about the things that he has already learned.  If you dog has been with you for a few weeks the chances are that he has learned when food is going to be available -- the sounds of the can opener or the opening of the closet door where his food is kept, or even, if he is fed from the table, to beg at dinner time. He has learned that a leash means a walk, that if the front door is left open a crack he can dash out and run for a few hours, and that when he is left alone he can destroy things in the house because he has never been caught in the act.<br>  <br>  One of the most important things for you to learn is that it IS possible to teach the dog what you want him to learn.  The dog is always learning.  You have to learn how to reward the dog so that it is in his best interests to do what you want him to do.<br>  <br>  If your dog is destructive when left alone, it is because he has not been caught in the act of doing wrong.  See the chapter on crates.<br>  <br>  If your dog dashes out the front door, it is because he has been given the opportunity to escape and then is being rewarded by the freedom to roam the neighborhood.  If this is your problem, put a ten foot rope on the dog and let him drag it around the house.  (called a house line)  Just before you open the door step on the rope, or, for a big dog, leave a loop in the end and loop it over the inside door handle.  When the dog dashes out the front door you have a handle with which to jerk him back in.  After a few times or a few dozen times (depending on the dog) he will catch on that it is painful to dash out the door and he will stop.  <br>  <br>  Congratulations!!  You have just taught your dog a lesson that *may* save his life, and *will*l save your hours of chasing.<br>  As long as he is dragging this rope around the house, if you have a problem with him jumping on people you can solve that too.  All you have to do is to step on the rope where it hits the floor.  If he jumps up, the rope tightens, giving him an automatic correction.  If he doesn't jump up, nothing happens.<br>  <br>  Every dog should have two names.  One for talking  TO him and one for talking ABOUT him or for giving him a command.  If you use his name when you are talking about him you will desensitize him to the use of his name.  Every time you say his name make it a happy occasion for him.  Use his name when you feed him.  If you want to give him a snack, instead of saying "snack" say his name.  Every time I say my dog's name she thinks that I am saying "snack" and she comes running.  Much better than yelling "snack"  or "cookie" whenever I want her to come.  Much more dignified!!<br>  <br>  Most people have a life, aside from training the dog, so that I'm not going to tell you to train the dog for one hour a day.  Also, if you have a very young puppy one hour will be much too much for him.  Five or ten minutes at a time, two or three times a day will be far better to get the training into the dog's mind.<br>  <br>  The purpose of obedience training is to teach your dog to be a well-mannered companion, who is responsive to your commands and who looks to you for leadership.  The process of training should be enjoyable for you both, and enhance the bond between you as well.<br>  <br>  How Dogs Learn<br>  <br>  Dogs learn by associating an action with a consequence.  If <br>  the consequence is pleasurable, the dog will tend to repeat the behavior.  If the consequence is unpleasant, he will tend not to repeat the behavior.<br>  <br>  In training you show your dog the action you wish, helping him to perform it by luring him with food or a toy, or by collar pressures.  When he performs the action, you immediately provide a pleasant consequence, by rewarding him with a special praise word and giving him a small treat. This is called "positive reinforcement," and will cause your dog, after several repetitions, to repeat the action.<br>  <br>  If you give your dog a command word at the same time that he performs the behavior, he will learn to associate the behavior with the command.<br>  <br>  For example, in order to teach your dog to sit, say the command SIT as you help him to do it.  This can be done by luring his head up with food or a toy held in your hand, which will cause his rear to sink into a sit, or by use of collar pressure coupled with the pressure of your hand on his rump.  The instant he sits, say his special praise word and give him a tiny treat.  After many repetitions of this he will make the association between the command word SIT and the act of sitting.  He will learn to obey the command by being positively reinforced by your praise word and a treat.<br>  <br>  Using A Special Word to Speed Learning<br>  <br>  You can speed up your dog's learning a lot by using a very special praise word reserved for the purpose of telling him that the action he is performing is correct and that he will be reinforced for it.  You can also use a "clicker" instead of a special word.  (Dolphin and killer whale trainers use a whistle for this purpose.  You've probably seen this at dolphin shows or on TV.  The whistle tells the dolphin that what he did was correct, and he can get a fish to eat.)  We suggest using a single word such as "great" or "yes" or "wow" that is different from general praise words like "good boy."<br>  <br>  You dog will first need to learn that this special sound, called a "conditioned reinforcer" means something.  Teach this at home by saying the word (or clicking your clicker if you are using one) and immediately giving the dog a tiny, succulent food treat.  The order is very important.  FIRST you say the word, THEN you give the treat.  Your dog shouldn't be doing anything special, just say the word and toss the treat.  After several repetitions of this you will see your dog startle and look at you when you say the word.  That means that he has learned that it means "a goodie is coming."  Now you can use your conditioned reinforcer to clearly tell him he has performed an action correctly and will be reinforced for it, with food, a toy, praise, play, or all three.<br>  <br>  In order for this to work, you must find something your dog likes and will work for that you can couple with your conditioned reinforcer.  For most dogs, tiny pieces of soft, tasty food work best.  We suggest tiny pieces of hot dog, cheese, soft-moist cat food, or lunch meat.  Buy a cheap belt pack to carry the food in when you are training and at class.  Once your dog has learned commands, you will not need to carry food, and can reinforce with praise, petting and play, but using food initially will help him learn much faster.<br>  <br>  Remember that your conditioned reinforcer must be given the instant the dog obeys your command and while he is still performing the behavior, and not several seconds later.  You will need to train him daily in order for commands to become part of his long-term memory.  He needs to be quiet and controlled while you are teaching him.  He can't learn if he is wildly excited or not paying attention to you.  Therefore, begin his training in quiet, familiar places, and add distractions later as he becomes proficient in his commands.<br>  <br>  As you start this obedience course, it will seem like there is a huge amount of things you need to learn and remember - new words, new ways of handling your dog, and new ways of relating to him.  Don't worry about trying to learn it all at once.  It will all be repeated over the weeks of the course and you'll find it becomes second nature as you gradually train your dog.  <br>  <br>  Just relax and have fun.<br>  <br>  And remember these three things that form the cornerstone of dog training:<br>  <br>  PATIENCE                        <br>  <br>  PRACTICE              <br>  <br>  PERSEVERANCE<br>  <br>  It should take a while to teach the dog all this stuff. I am being vague on purpose!! Don't panic if the dog doesn't seem to be catching on in one week.  Training takes time.  If you doubt that the dog is making any progress, keep a training diary.  This will help you see just how often you are training (once a week won't work) and you will be able to see that you ARE getting somewhere.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|ML8IH0Fmaa	This question is quite broad...<br>  <br>  You will need to start with one command at a time. I suggest  "come here" since it's the one that's most important.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest that you need to have a light & long rope on your dog & some treats. <br>  <br>  Let your dog explore etc, then call them when they are sufficiently far enough away, if they come then make a big deal about it and give them treats. if they don't come after a couple of calls start pulling them in (gently) with the rope, then make a big deal when they get there and give them treats.<br>  <br>  Start off by giving them treats all the time, then gradually less and less often as they learn.|`|20XmVO96aa	NILIF (Nothing in life is free)<br>  <br>  I personely think it's the best way.  My dog is very food motivated. It teaches your dog that you are in charge of all things.<br>  <br>  Works great!!!|`|3bed406eee16534b85be16f1564324a7aa	call someone profetional to train him/her|`|6bd9fd04ae466379ea4d64238d5729aeaa	Many times the local junior college or high school has a dog training class. Also there are a lot of good training books out there. <br>  I've had dogs trained by other people and I've trained some of them myself. It seems to me that the dogs I trained myself formed a better bond with me than the ones I sent to a trainer. <br>  Always start with simple commands and work your way up to more difficult commands.<br>  Also remember some breeds of dogs are much easier to train than others. You did not mention the type of dog you have. <br>  Good luck and remember the more you work with the dog the better your results will be. Also stay calm- dogs respond better to positive rewards, than hitting them, or other forms of abusive behavior.|`|nW1D8auZaa	Patience, understanding and repetitious behavior. You must train yourself before you start to train an animal. Dogs are such smart animals they pick up behaviors from their owners.

Lo puedes notar en komo reaccionan cuando miran a una persona adulta y a un ni?o...a veces se asustan cuando ven a un ni?o,por que saben ke son traviesos a veces jejejeje|`|z0kXu7IIaa	Todo indica que si, pero a lo mejor ellos igual nos ven y nos quieren siempre y cuando los tratemos bien.|`|dPTuxl8uaa	si, por el olfato|`|14e73a4d1aaa9f855ae20a76f693467aaa	Claro que un can por instinto sabe diferenciar. Pero los "perros de la calle" sabiendo diferenciar cometen faltas a Dios, y no saben respetar, ni aceptar valores.|`|EFur9rc9aa	la verdad, un estudio demostro que si, el tama?o del humano hace la forma del perror, piensa, un perro chiquito le ladra a los nenitos, pero si pasan varios nenitos, el perro nada, al ver un conjunto, el perro se siente debil, y al ver algo mas alto que el conjunto, el perro es capas de tener una gran cantidad de miedo. La edad no la saben XD|`|OkFwXrrOaa	Los perros "leen" el lenguaje corporal muchìsimo mas que nosotros, que fuimos perdiendo esa capacidad.<br>  Las actitudes de un ni?o son muy diferentes a las de un adulto o un anciano, dejando de lado el tama?o de cada uno.<br>  <br>  Te cuento que yo tenìa una perra gran danès. Ella jugaba muy bruto con mi marido, menos bruto conmigo, suave con mi hija y con mi tìa de 90 a?os era la delicadeza en persona.<br>  Tanto que si venìa corriendo y la veìa, frenaba, la rodeaba lentamente y despuès seguìa corriendo.<br>  Yo creo que sabìa de su fragilidad, mas que de su edad, y lo mismo pasa con los chicos.<br>  <br>  Por el contrario, hay perros que muerden a los ni?os y no a los adultos, y eso sì que pasa por una cuestiòn de dominancia, ya que el chico es de tama?o mas peque?o, generalmente le teme si lo agrede, juega "de igual a igual" Vale decir, no le da signos de que no està socialmente sobre èl, no le demuestra autoridad, <br>  Te mando cari?os.|`|uAAX9Geyaa	Si estoy segura ,de echo mi perro cuando esta con los chicos mueve la cola y juega ,cuando esta conmigo que sabe que lo alimento y lo cuido pero no juego ,solo me sigue con respeto y espera mis ordenes, y cuando esta con la abuelita de 93 a?os ,se queda quietecito en sus pies como tratando de no molestarla, la mira con ternura y cuando ella se mueve el se le acerca sigiloso y la observa pero siempre sin molestar ni con el movimiento de su cola.|`|IkkEfjV6aa	NO|`|OtnrMtCAaa	Por supuesto que un perro sabe cuando se encuentra delante de un ni?o , de un adulto ó de un viejecito.<br>  La actitud de mis perros no es la misma , cuando llegan  ni?os peque?os a casa, suelen mostrarse recelosos ( no vaya a ser que les quiten su sitio), aunque saben que el juego está asegurado.<br>  Con las personas mayores, se comportan más sosegadamente, nunca saltan ni se les suben encima...será porque respetan las canas!<br>  un saludo.|`|SyQLArV3aa	Si, los perros lo diferencia. Te cuento de forma breve lo que mi perro hacia.<br>  <br>  Yo tenia un vecino, que tenia 98 a?os, lamentablemente hace 1 mes fallecia a la edad de 101 a?os.<br>  Bueno, mi vecino, siempre pasaba por mi casa bien serca de la reja, y el perro siempre lo dejaba entrar a mi casa, lo acompa?aba, y eso que era jugueton pero mi perro se ponia super bueno he iba a todos lados con el. Sabindo que era una persona mayor.<br>  <br>  Suerte!!!|`|ZFQNu1FPaa	los perros tienen esa capacidad de olfato. hasta pueden detectar cuando hay una mujer embarazada.|`|ZtjRMhAtaa	yo creo que si lo que pasa es que si tu eres mas grande y controlas al perro el perro te identifica como su lider lo que no pasa con los ni?os mas peque?os ok.a mayor control mayor respeto|`|gzxIcrZwaa	yo creo k si pork saben como jugar brusco o normal|`|riBniPbaaa	yo creo que si. x que hay perros que si se les acerca un ni?o se enojan y si es un adulto no y viceversa.|`|267764b0acca1292d560892ae972a0bdaa	si claro que si ellos saben yo tengo un perro que no se lleva con los ni?os porque cuando era chiquito era abusado por 2 ni?as lo mordian en sus patas la mama me lo regalo ya que el perro ya queria morder a las nenas por eso tuvo que regalarlo|`|GXGqJlfiaa	los perros no diferencian la edad al menos eso creo y diferencian a las personas por el olfato|`|GwxBrrteaa	yo cro que si debido a que tratan diferente al un ni?o que aun anciano|`|IiJcIhTTaa	yo creo que no, porque igual son como muy bruscos con los ni?os chiquitos... ellos no saben que hay que tratarlos con mas cuidado|`|WjlKDUpPaa	si lo saben   se dejan guiar por el olor de la persona|`|XdEUWei9aa	si|`|a0xIzDhaaa	yo creo que si porque mi perro y muchos  no quieren a los adultos y a los ni?os si  y aveses al revés y por eso algunos diferencian|`|e1326ede1ce33dfde2f80596a58b236aaa	yo creo q si, xq algunos perros c ponen celosos cuando llega un bebe a la flia, al iwal q los perros q acompa?an a ancianos|`|qRcENSqHaa	No se pero ellos pueden olfatear muchas cosas como si eres amable, si estas sufriendo, si tienes frio, si estas enojado, incluso saben si va a haber un temblor.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Yep, totally normal. Cats shed their hair for the summer so they remain cooler, and grow hair back again for the winter so they can stay warmer. Break out the vacuum cleaners for spring - it's a yearly process. :)|`|3iGGcbRsaa	of course it is, my cat always sheds, it helps them because during the summer they tend to get very hot and by shedding it gets rid of the uneeded fur!
10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Just a note - if people aren't giving you the answers you "need," maybe your mind isn't open to any other suggestions but the ones you want to hear... Just a thought.<br>  <br>  First, research. Know everything there is to know about ferret behavior, cleanliness (or lack thereof), training, and care. <br>  <br>  Then, prove to your parents that you know everything about ferrets. Sit them down, and be their Ferret Teacher for a few minutes. Not only will this pet be yours, but it'll be running around their house, as well. Let them know what they might (or might not) be in for. <br>  <br>  Also, your parents might be against you having pets because they're unsure of your responsibility levels. Prove to them that, because you've done your research, you can make intelligent, informed decisions about pet care.<br>  <br>  Try pet-sitting a few times for neighbors or friends of the family. Advertise in your school, by word of mouth, or (with your parents' help and permission) in your local newspaper. Not only will this give you good practice for when you have your own pet, but you'll also figure out whether you'd like having a pet. This will also be key for showing your parents that you can, in fact, take care of a live animal and not kill it, or have it destroy the house. Plus, you get money for it, too! <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't make this a secret process. Involve your parents in every step. <br>  <br>  In the event that they refuse, don't whine or shout at them. Hear their side out, and try to understand their reasoning. They won't just say no to make you unhappy - they'll have a good reason behind what they say. Be diplomatic, and discuss it with them - see if you can come up with some kind of compromise. Your maturity will impress them.|`|IwGPkMJbaa	First of all, WHY don't your parents want you not to have a pet? My parents thought it was too expensive and smelly. You did your research - tell them you know how to take care of him/her and you are responsible. Also, ask them what they're argument is. Good luck!|`|db5fb9290c3cb16bd1e22f4a51731e8aaa	The first question whether to get a child a pet is usually the same.  Who is going to take care of it?  It is a living creature, if it is ignored or not properly taken care of, it will get sick, or worse.  So the first step is proving that you are responsible enough to handle for it's care.  If you have a history of being irresponsible, then it is a lost cause.|`|pBTLIgIRaa	if u have a pet that u dont realy play with(it has to be ur pet tho) as much then tell ur mom u will sell it then post that pet on www.craigslist.com then when u get the money for the pet use that money to get a new pet that is wat i did with my ferret|`|1suW9dpOaa	I believe that your parents will approve of your decision to be a pet owner if you show responsibility. You need to show that you are old enough to take care of yourself and perhaps of others. If you have a brother or sister even, take care of them. I understand they are not pets but when you are able to do things without being told or show that you are able to handle tasks at hand, your parents will consider doing more then just letting you have a pet. Start with something really small, like a fish. Sure it's not much, but its needs to be taken care of. Move your way up and show that you have what it takes.|`|yF974SFUaa	OK, how much work do you do around the house? In other words, have you proved to your parents that you are responsible enough for pet ownership? Since you've done your research, you know how to control ferret odors, etc.<br>  Marshal your facts, and when your parents are in a good mood, sit down with them & talk it over calmly and rationally. Show them your facts and resources. Explain, in detail, how you will care for the little guys.<br>  Talk to some ferret owners and see if you can borrow one or two of their ferrets for a few days so your parents can see just how cute the little furballs are. That may be all you need to do.<br>  Work up a contract with your folks that states that if the ferrets get to be a nuisance, you will find another home for them.<br>  Remember, be calm, logical, respectful and persistent|`|PBLBxf1maa	keep bugging them they will eventually give in|`|63cvgc0qaa	show your parents that you are responsible thats what i did do little things likedoing your chores without being asked or kleen up without being asked kiss thier butts if u have to|`|Xk5U5Uj6aa	I don't think ferrets are mean or anything like that. To convince your parents to get a ferret, first they have to believe that you have responsibility, and that they can trust you to take care of it. Think about expenses.....will you pay for it yourself? Maybe you should save up money to show your parents you are responsible. With the money, you could buy a cage, the pet, and everything else ferrets need. Do you have enough time to take care of it? Show your parents you can care for a pet. Ferrets are great pets because they aren't too big, pretty easy to take care of, and it's possible to create a loving relationship with them. They are also less expensive than things like dogs/cats. Hope this helps!!! Tell me how it works out!|`|vWsIQO9daa	Well for starters, how about trying the following:<br>  #1 Cleaning your room and making sure that it STAYS clean and tidy.<br>  #2 Making sure that your homework is done and handed in on time.<br>  #3 Sweep the floors in the living room and kitchen without your parents asking you to.<br>  #4 Wash and/or dry the dishes.<br>  #5 Do not fight and argue with your sisters & brothers.<br>  #6 Eat what you are given and don't whine or make "yuck" faces when given it. <br>  #7 Don't talk rudly to adults<br>  #8  Always share with other kids.<br>  #9 Go to bed when you are told to.<br>  #10 Research the pet and breed you want to be 100% certain that it is the right one for you.<br>  # 11 Ask them about getting this new pet in a nice way and don't beg and whine about it. <br>  <br>  If 100% sure that if you give those a try, they will see that you are serious about wanting to add a this pet to your life and family. :)

It is very important to her and the kittens too to be fed a  high quality food to help her along.<br>  Eventually she won't let them nurse anymore.<br>  Please have her spayed.|`|JrnXCy49aa	Have her spayed, best thing to do.|`|cENCwe2raa	yes it will hurt she could end up with mastitis,and the year old shouldnt even be suckling now...the kittens should be fully weaned at 8 weeks,just keep them all away from her and let her get some nutrition back into her body...  shes been a milking machine for over a year,no wonder she so small..|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	She'll make them stop.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the older cats try to get in for some milk when the mother has newer kittens, even unrelated cats will. They like the milk, I guess.|`|JP3oR1H1aa	kitten should nurse for about 8 weeks then shown to the kitten chow...  move the kittens away from mom and to the food dish...  they may be hurting mom and themselves|`|ZwfDQLrfaa	If she's having any trouble she'll bat them away on her own.

enNSH7Dbaa	hola<br>  <br>  Alimentación y cuidados<br>  <br>  Las ninfas, al ser aves granívoras, no requieren una alimentación muy especial. El alpiste, la avena o el mijo constituyen la base de sus necesidades. Una vez a la semana podemos darle maravilla, pero no debemos excedernos, ya que estas semillas tienen mucha grasa. A?adiremos algunas frutas, como la manzana, y verduras, como la lechuga o la acelga, para completar su dieta. Cuando vaya a criar, podemos completar sus aportes de calcio con huevo duro -con cáscara molida incluida-. El agua debe cambiarse a diario: debe ser fresca y estar a temperatura ambiente. <br>  <br>  Una vez a la semana procederemos a limpiar la jaula porque las heces de las aves pueden ser nocivas para ellas, por eso deberemos retirarlas de la jaula y limpiar los restos de las barras. También eliminaremos la fruta o vegetales que se hayan pasado y sus desperdicios. <br>  <br>  Deberemos vigilar que coman, que estén activas y que sus excreciones no sean anómalas. Acudiremos al veterinario cada vez que veamos algún signo que nos haga pensar que nuestra ninfa está enferma.<br>  <br>  También evitaremos tener muchos ejemplares en jaulas peque?as, ya que el hacinamiento puede provocar peleas y enfermedades. Para criar un solo pájaro, o una pareja, la jaula será de un metro por un metro, con dos barras para saltar, aletear y posarse. Si tenemos varias ninfas, una jaula de metro y medio de alto, dos de largo y uno y medio de ancho puede ser suficiente para seis ejemplares.<br>  <br>  El cortejo y la reproducción<br>  <br>  En el apareamiento, el macho inicia su cortejo con bellos cantos, moviendo las alas y agitando la cabeza. Las hembras que han sido fecundadas pueden poner entre cinco y siete huevos. El nido tendrá dentro serrín para que sea más cálido y tiene que ser lo suficientemente amplio para los huevos y su incubación: podemos construir nosotros mismos un nido de madera de 40 centímetros de alto por 30 centímetros de largo y ancho.<br>  <br>  La hembra incuba los huevos durante tres semanas hasta que se rompen. Pero, las crías no salen del nido hasta que no haya pasado un mes. Si queremos criar ninfas lo mejor es comprar los ejemplares con unos seis meses de edad: con dos a?os estarán preparadas para la cópula. <br>  <br>  Es mucho más sencillo obtener crías en una jaula con varios ejemplares, porque en ellas, las ninfas se 'escogerán' para el cortejo como deseen. Si tenemos una sola ninfa, tendremos que 'acercar' en su propia pajarera a otra del sexo opuesto y ver si hay un buen comportamiento para el apareamiento, porque puede suceder que se rechacen. <br>  <br>  Este tipo de cotorra se puede aparear en cualquier momento del a?o, aunque el mejor es la primavera, ya que la buena temperatura y las horas de sol benefician la cría de los polluelos. Mucho cari?o, higiene y una alimentación adecuada también son fundamentales para criar a estas bellas aves.<br>  <br>  mas informacion ( consejos):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mascotasyhogar.com/mascotas/aves/?pagina=mascotas_aves_011_011" rel="nofollow">http://www.mascotasyhogar.com/mascotas/a...</a><br>  <br>  espero que te ayude...............<br>  <br>  saludos|`|OtnrMtCAaa	Con la compra de "mascotas", estás potenciando la venta de animales que aunque sea legal encontrarías gratis en cualquier protectora. <br>  Con la compra de animales exóticos , y " fuera de lo común ", estarás fomentando la venta ilegal de animales protegidos ó en extinción.<br>  Cualquier animal arrancado de su hábitat natural le estamos acortando casi a la mitad la duración de su vida. <br>  Algunos de estos para encerrarlos en una jaula! otros no se adaptarán nunca al clima de tu país, a la calefacción de tu casa....<br>  <br>  Sé coherente ....NO COMPRES ANIMALES POR MODA. <br>  <br>  !!!

TE4aSo1kaa	Don't put it on the floor, it may get kicked.<br>  Don't put it next to the TV, hamsters aren't awake for a majority of the day so the TV can wake them up. Hamsters get cranky if you wake them up.<br>  Don't put it in the window either, it can get extremely hot or cold.<br>  I think your best bet is the dresser near your bed. However, with this you should get a silent wheel so the hamster doesn't disturb you at night so much (they're up for most of the night).<br>  I recommend Silent Spinners or Wodent Wheels.<br>  Most hamster starter kits they stick in your face at the pet store have dinky wheels that are very noisy, so those are a throwaway.<br>  Never get wire wheels, they're too noisy and they're a safety hazard for your hamster because their feet can get stuck between the bars.<br>  If you can't find Silent Spinners or Wodent Wheels on sale anywhere, get a plastic wheel. If it makes noise at night (which it probably will) just rub some vegetable oil on the back of it, which will reduce the noise.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|174ecf3bb83bf13823e446b49ed3fa4daa	Put it next to the window. That way, your hamster will get lots of light, and you can always open the window if it starts to smell too much like a hamster in your room! Re-arrange a few things if you need to.|`|Ng5QmZv3aa	put it on a shelf or someplace high|`|BpQn6wMiaa	avoid the floor if you can because if the cage is in a draft the hamster could get ill (they don't do well in cold or hot weather - average room temp. is fine) also avoid radiators for the same reason. <br>  make sure the hamster is away from loud noises (like if you have a really noisy tv) and think about what you have beside the cage, if it is beside curtains or sheets it can eat holes in them thru the cage (i made that mistake once - oops)<br>  i hope that helps|`|2febb9a6925b75825aaf7d87207f9700aa	Don't put it next to the TV it will be disturbed by the noise.

2MLk4O9Maa	Because it's typically harmful to the animals. It's sad that people tend to only focus on the abuse of experimentation with animals, but may not give a second thought to the fur trade or food production abuse. Typically rats are used in labs because they're very similar to us physiologically and the rate of reproduction is much more rapid with them so it's easier to test for generational birth defects. I think it's ridiculous how much we make animals suffer for our own vanity. I wish products had to display that on their packaging, like they have to display trans-fats and other ingredients.|`|hYhdAB8qaa	i don't know...the use rats and mice fo test subjects all the time. <br>  People are finicky though. Don't care at all about the rats, but if a bunny or a dog is used, they go crazy. |`|AA11373993	Depends on the experiment. Anything that will harm the animal is a big NO!|`|tv2e834uaa	Humans are better subjects.|`|RBhvMpaOaa	Most of the time it isn't necessary. Why should we spray cosmetics in bunnies eyes just for the sake of beauty? There are other ways to test new products than using animals. <br>  <br>  |`|HtldloyTaa	Oh Yes! Lets not test the product on animals! and just give it to people! so that they can be possibly killed and harmed! such a great idea! such intelligent people!<br>  <br>  God Bless America<br>  <br>  And every idiot born ever day|`|1VJIkjjYaa	because animals are living breathing creatures and anything that puts them at harm is cruel .........Why would you even ask this question?|`|d1sS6WR6aa	because they are living things and they dont need to die|`|ATeFooJ4aa	because they are living things just like us so they shouldn't have to get harmed|`|X7xIgjuMaa	animals testing is really bad|`|iJJlQAeRaa	Bcuz They die|`|SdS9Qcayaa	all the answers u have received r good, they all forgot one big thing though, it has been proven time and time again that animal testing is unnecessary it is inaccurate and results can and are false readings a lot of major companies like avon, petro canada, shell, and the army have stopped using animals for testing they have found that the results printed out from computers has a 100% more accurate reading so the need for animal testing is no longer needed but companies like IAMS and Marshall  and some cosmetics still use animals in there sick testing |`|709KrOHxaa	Because they cannot get away from the situation if they wanted to. Sometimes it physically hurts them and I don't think it is ok to just do whatever you want to an animal because they can't say no.

XxU94aKlaa	* Adoption Fee- Anywhere from $50 for a shelter dog, to over $1,000 for a purebred puppy from a reputable breeder.<br>  * Shots- Anywhere from $50 to $100 roughly depending on where you go.<br>  * Spay/ Neuter- Anywhere from free to $400 again depending on where you go. There are areas that will go by your income, vets, factors such as health of the dog (and if it's a female if she's in heat or not). You would have to call around.<br>  * Crate- Anywhere from $50 to $150 (+) depending on what you buy.<br>  * Puppy Training Classes- Roughly $100 though that my go up or down depending on where you go.<br>  * Leash and collar- About $20 on up, again depending on what you buy.<br>  * Food/ Water Dishes- $10 on up, again depending on what you get.<br>  * Toys- Anywhere from free if you make your own and what not, to a few $100. This is really going to depend on you. Personally for a dog and a ferrt I find myself paying about $200 + a year on just entertainment for them.<br>  * Dog sweater- About $20 for one. You need at least one for a Chihuahua as they get cold very easily.<br>  * Dog Food- Likely about $40 to $80 a month depending on the type of food, and how much food you feed.<br>  * Grooming supplies- About $40 +. You need nail clippers, brushes, shampoo, and so on. Can get expensive fast. If you plan to take you're dog in to get groomed you're looking at about $30 or more a month depending on where you go.<br>  * Vet check- Once a year at least, and it's going to cost about $50 (maybe more or less depending on where you live and where you go). Shots need to be done once a year, and you'll be in and out of here depending on what happens. This could cost anywhere from the basic $100 or less in a month, or into the thousands depending on what's going on.<br>  * Destruction- Could cost you nothing, could cost you over $1,000. Depends on what you're dog gets into. You're almost defiantly going to be going through paper towels like crazy while potty training though.<br>  And I’m sure there’s a ton more I’m missing on this list.<br>  <br>  You’re looking at about $1,000 a year at least assuming that there’s no major health problems or medical emergences. You’re looking at far more than that for the first year of course.<br>  Dogs are expensive, even small ones.|`|pGacaRuFaa	Chihuahuas are cheaper to feed than a larger breed. Vet bills should be about average, depending on the dog's health. Puppy mill dogs cost more in vet bills over time. Dog clothing isn't completely necessary, but a sweater and booties are almost required when the weather is cold. Chihuahuas can freeze to death quite quickly if left outside in cold climates.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	Every dog is expensive. <br>  <br>  -Purebred pup by itself could range from $250-1000. <br>  -Shots could be around $100 in total, (Depending on your vet)<br>  -Neutering/Spaying could be anywhere from $35-150.<br>  -Treats, food, toys, crate, leashes, harnesses, and collar could be another $250 easily.<br>  |`|bPdqwkpPaa	I've spent $7000 on my 12lb dog in the 4 years that I've had her. <br>  <br>  You basically need to budget $2500 for the first year<br>  $1000-$1500 a year after that<br>  and<br>  $2500 IN SAVINGS for an emergency. |`|EWXzNyk8aa	Any dog is expensive to own. It's never the cost of adopting the dog, it's the care it needs. You will need to buy food every few weeks. You will need grooming supplies (nail clippers, shampoo, etc.). The dog will need to go to the vet at least once a year for vaccinations, which will cost at the most $50. The dog will need to be spayed/neutered, which at my vet costs $360. You are going to probably want to get it some toys to keep him/her busy. You probably want a collar and leash too. I am definitely not trying to persuade you not to get a dog. I just want you to know how expensive they can be. Hope you are able to get one! Good luck:)|`|hhKfKN2xaa	I have two of them.  I buy them food specific to Chihuahuas because they are picky eaters and need a very good diet.  Shots once a year not bad but did I did read recently that they can cause more damage than most dogs. I have to admit that they like to chew crotches out of jeans, sweats, etc. It is a trait of chihuahuas, lol.  My daughter has gotten a few pair of jeans chewed up. She is 8.  I love them though. Good luck. PS You can find spay/neuter clinics that have reasonable fees for those services.|`|SZsN1IMjaa	I'm pretty sure they need the same shots every dog needs. Being smaller they might not need as much, but you have to talk to your vet because there are so many variables in terms of cost. Food might be a little cheaper because the dog won't be eating as much as a large breed...|`|ADQorF3saa	I wouldn't say that they are more expensive than any other dog, but there are going to be costs. spay or neuter about 200.00  shots about three sets of 60-65.oo  food and supplies depends on the brand but approx. 200.00 just to get you started, like bed, crate, brush, leash, collar, bowls, food, chew toys, baggies for picking up the mess. |`|zr10Hvtbaa	i had a friend who had a chiuawa...he was expensive because he peed on everything. make sure you train him well and consistent because he is so small it is hard to catch him peeping in the house. his shots, etc. are the same as any dog. vet visit..approx. $70.00...rabies shot approx. $20.00...so 90.00 a year with no other problems. dog food for a little guy wont be expensive at all. he wont eat much...but he can ruin some carpet if you dont train him well!!|`|IGeA1Oplaa	The cost of the dog depends on the breeder and the pet shop. I think including to get the dog, about 600-900 dollars a year. With out the dog, about 100-250 dollars a year.|`|XoMbCX2jaa	Its about as expensive as any other dog, only its usually about 500$ to get a chi. Once u have one, they aren't particularly expensive.|`|bIaywrBCaa	The first year costs the most because of initial puppy shots and spay/neuter if it is done, and of course toys, etc. About $1500, maybe including costs of puppy, etc first year and then after that about $500 a year if dog is healthy. First year puppy gets 4 rounds of shots, about $30-50 each including vet checks, worming, etc, And a rabies vaccine.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	It would be similar to other dogs, though obviously it would eat less than a Irish Wolfhound. Vet cost vary by area, just call around and ask what they charge for different services (ask about the cost of visits, vaccines, and spaying/neutering,in particular, you may want to ask about emergency costs too)<br>  <br>  You do need to be particularly careful to get it from a good breeder though. It is more expensive upfront, but because these dogs are so popular, and are popular with people that want a cute little doggie more than a pet. If you don't buy from a reputable breeder, you are likely to have a sickly dog requiring more and more expensive vet visits.<br>  <br>  ADD: I would think part of the reasons Chihuahuas are more destructive is because people get them because they are tiny and cute, and then don't train them right. It is easier to brush off a misbehaving Chihuahua than a misbehaving Rottweiler.

You should establish the fact that you own him, and it's your territory.|`|SZX3GNP8aa	If you didn't know dogs can get bladder problems! so he might have that! i would go to a vet and get it checked out i hope this helped you!|`|cf3b4c9a1788b436ca969afa64100affaa	Separation Anxiety.|`|4nJ75Qd3aa	maybe he's sick|`|s76aC4G8aa	It's not out of spite, thats a human emotion not a canine one, so he's not mad or doing it out of spite, he's marking you and your bed showing he's dominant over you.  He's putting his scent OVER yours.  Time to establish yourself as his pack leader, right now he doesn't see you that way.<br>  <br>  He needs rules, boundaries and limitations, he needs exercise, discipline and affection in that order.  I suggest you watch the Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan and learn how to be pack leader - it doesn't involve doing alpha roles, pack leadership is established otherways that don't require forced training, and also watch "It's Me Or The Dog" with trainer Victoria Stillwell.  Cesar has some good books out you might want to read and there are a ton of training books at your local book store that teach positive reinforcement training and pack leadership.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|xnT5bzmuaa	Our dog was peeing on our rug every time we left the house. The only thing that has seem to work is that we put him in his bed (a cage w/ a blanket and pillow to make it comfortable for him) when we leave the house. At first I thought this was wrong to do to him b/c he would run under the bed and hide but he seems to like it now. He gets in the bed when he sees us getting ready, I have even left a couple of times without locking it and have come home and he's still in it. I hope this can help you.|`|rMzEt909aa	When you were away from your dog, were you around or handling other dogs?  When we come home, our dog will smell all over us to see where we've been and oh boy!  When we've been petting other dogs, she really smells us like crazy!  So, maybe your dog is smelling other dogs on you, and is simply marking you as his territory.  <br>  As for peeing on your bed, you should make it off limits to him until he is fully housebroken; and you may even want to use a baby gate to keep him out of your bedroom until that time.   That urine smell will always be on your bed now, and he will continue to pee there because of that.  |`|NmsBFeNJaa	It sounds like he is acting out because of your leaving him. He needs you to give him a little extra attention when you are around and especially when leaving or coming home. It will help if he knows that you don't want to leave him and are happy to see him when you come home. Also, leave a radio or tv on for him because it sounds like he may be a little lonely.|`|e31c3b4a1b836747babaec9e9e6f3394aa	Well, they do have their little personalities. I've had my share with both dogs and cats getting upset because I leave or not paying attention to them, didn't clean the litter box right away, etc. Litter box incident was when I didn't change the litter right away and I ended up finding my good socks and blouse in the litter box peed on. Just talk with your Vet, they can give you the best advice on what to do and how to take it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nGBSRDTXaa	Believe it or not, animals don't do stuff like that to "get back at you". Try taking him to the vet, because it could be a medical problem.|`|jJ8sR2zWaa	He does the same with me when hes mad i didnt take him out. I find it funny though.
JSFCkne8aa	If you already have the bird why don't you know what to feed it?<br>  That is very irresponsible, I don't think you are ready to have this bird.<br>  You need to take it back to where you got it before it dies.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Has it been weaned? <br>  What was it eating at the store? <br>  You should have come home with his food when you got him.|`|fnPyq2iqaa	.
1gDTiPVyaa	I'd give him at least a couple of days, but if he's already partly trained, let him let you know when he's ready.  He may decide for you.<br>  <br>  You might try rewarding him with a treat when he steps up in the cage. That might induce him to do it easier. Usually stepping up is a bigger issue out of the cage.  He may have already decided that the cage is his territory and he doesn't have to obey when he's in his house. I would keep working on it to save future problems.<br>  <br>  Make sure to do a check of the room he'll be in and look for any hazards you may have missed before you bring him home and check again before you let him out once he is home.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck!|`|qeOlkRM0aa	It just takes persistence, and he will step up in no time.<br>  <br>  As far as how long to wait, give him a day or two to settle in, but you can play it by ear. Depending on his personality, he may be ready to come out soon or after a few days. It sounds like he is already partly trained, so things should go easily for you.

bEQn0Vrtaa	I had a guinea pig that bit me and every time she did i kissed her right on the mouth and cuddled her. It only took 6 weeks for her to figure out that her mouth was for kissing not biting and that she got all the cuddling also.<br>  <br>  Try it i am sure it will work for you also, but you can not respond negatively at all to the bit or that will shame her and delete the response we are looking for.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your guinea pig|`|nPdKJyK4aa	Maybe your guinea pig smells food on your fingers? Or you smell like you would taste good. Dont use any fruit flavored lotions and wash your hands to make sure they dont smell yummy!

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	I've seen some crappy looking males and stunning looking females, and visa versa.    Just go and oogle the Betta section on Aqua Bid!    I love short-tailed males (plakats/plakads). Those who think all males have long fins are sorely mistaken! I've had a couple of plakat boys and they've been fantastic. Never had a female, not many places stock them near me.     My brother has a little girl I rescued from a bad mix community tank (got the whole tank) she's a curious little thing!|`|OsVswissaa	Well males have the long beautiful fins and brighter colours but the females have more attitude and are livlier, plus you can keep them in groups.|`|SY0cSoQuaa	I love the look of a female double ray Crowntail, very cute and spunky.

FfBll2n8aa	What do you mean "like" the ragdoll? In appearance or temperament? I have a ragdoll and think he's the best thing since sliced bread - if I could have two cats, I'd get another raggie in a second! Why don't you get a second one, but of a different colour? It's really hard to recommend a breed since you haven't said exactly what you want from it.|`|NEiE4zexaa	I think the breed you are looking for is Maine Coon.

oDVx7nSxaa	This is a question best asked of the vet - if your cat is up to date on rabies vaccines, then the cat has nothing to worry about. You, on the other hand, have come in to contact with the saliva of the coyote, and if rabies is indigenous to your area, then you are at possible risk as well.  Your cat also needs to see a vet, as those teeth and jaws may have caused internal injuries that you're just not seeing.  And I'd strongly suggest keeping your cat indoors from now on, or he might not be so lucky next time.|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	Hey your my new hero you saved your cat I just love you wow I would bring my cat to the vet as soon as possible  I don't think your cat will attack you tonight you will be safe I think it takes a while for the cat to become sick to the point of attacking someone but don't let the cat lick you with her saliva  I Sure hope you get help for your cat and most of all your my hero of the day ! maybe your cat will need antibiotics.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	It's actually quite rare for coyotes to have rabies in California, but I would still definately recommend that you take it to the vet to make sure. Also, is your cat up to date with its rabies shot, just in case?|`|oT71QN8Raa	You need to take kitty to the vet to make sure there are no internal injuries or bites that are more serious than you can tell.  <br>  <br>  I wouldnt be too concerned with rabies, considering you should have gotten your cat the rabies vaccine (especially if you are gonna let her outside).  Aside from that...if the coyote had rabies it would have attacked you not run away.  Rabid animals dont harbor the same fears that normal animals do.  They wont hesitate to walk right up to a human.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  As soon as I posted my answer, I realized you already considered the possibility of the coyote attacking you if it were rabid :)  So, yes, you're right.  It would have.|`|uwCcIY8Aaa	Keep it in a room for now. I don't think it would attack you if you just let it calm down for a bit. Take it to the vet tomorrow morning asap to get a test done on it. It's a bit late right now lol. Give your cat food and water and a liter box in a room that is closed off so it can't wander the house freely. If you are really worried about it right now, I'd find a 24 hour animal hospital around your area and take it there.|`|oIe3b65Naa	I would take it straight to the Vet. The cat might not be severely hurt, but he needs medical attention just the same. He might need stitches in his wounds, and probably rabies shot. Better be safe than sorry.|`|AA11457471	The rabies question is best asked of your vet or local animal control.<br>  <br>  I'm concerned that your cat may have internal injuries that you can't see.<br>  It's important to keep him warm to avoid going into shock & get him to the vet ASAP.|`|rvBZPIv4aa	Yikes!

B6zl0AJDaa	I've lived and boarded my horses around the world.  I've NEVER found a barn unless your horse is in "training" that supplies equipment for boarders to use unless it's on a temporary basis.    Here in CA, full care board with facilities that you are wanting run around $1,000.00/mo. and that's BEFORE training fees.|`|gbd4PMwfaa	I too am in IL and for pasture board with only hay provided I pay 200 but i work off 50 of it. For stall Board with hay and grain the price is 350. There are some other local barns that charge about 500 or so for stall board. When I leased at my old barn tack was included and lease was 250. Board in a stall was also 250. Pasture board was not provided. But if you own your own horse normaly people around here have their own tack, blankets, halters etc.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Why would they provide tack for your horse?     My full board is $850 a month but I purchased my own tack. It includes feed, water, blanket changes, monthly worming, supplements are extra. It has 2 indoors and 1 outdoor,|`|EghHVkHEaa	My boarding is $650 / month. And that's without lessons...so its like $700 / month if you want lessons too. But it's everything feed, stalls cleaned everyday, turnout, blankets, ect. They also have indoor and outdoor arena as well. Normally people that own their own horses have their own tack, but if you didn't i guess if you have school horses at your barn you could use their tack for a bit, but you will deffinatly need your own bridle, unless you want to swap bits everytime you ride; which would be kinda a pain in the rear-end haha.    Hope this helps..|`|908983fbfe23a5d7c345ce529efa904caa	WOW!! Everyone's going to hate me!! I live in North Central Wisconsin. I pay $150 a month for each of my 2 horses. That includes being stalled at night, good grassy hay, water, and sweet feed. I provide my own supplemants, Strategy for my Arab showhorse, and a glucosamine based additive for my 25 year old retired barrel horse. There is 80 acres of trails, and an indoor arena, large tack room, rest rooms, and a vet and farrier on call 24/7. All the boarders here were pre-screened and hand-selected by the couple that owns this place. That means we have a wonderful group of genuinely nice people. They never advertise, and they rarely have any openings. I have all my own tack, but for the most part, everyone who boards here is good about sharing what they have for those who still need to get everything. It is on the end of a quiet, dead end road. I know how incredibly lucky I am to have been accepted at this place. Around the bigger Wisconsin cities like Madison and Milwaukee, I would say board is on average $600 a month per horse, but they also have more amenities, such as on site trainers, cafes, and they give lessons, and mostly cater to the English riding clientele. Where I'm at, it is 99% Western style, with my Arab showhorse being the exception in our group of 30, but I still ride him Western, too. ;) I also have several friends who advertised on Craigslist, and found area farmers willing to rent out their unused pole sheds or small barns and some pasture for $75.00 a month, and the horse owner has to provide all the food and come everyday and take care of their horses. Another group of my friends all went in together and got a 10 year lease on a small stable. The people who owned it were elderly, and did not want to deal with horses anymore, so they just live in the house. My friends house their horses there, and sublet stalls to other boarders. There are many ways to keep a horse, without spending a small fortune, especially since you live in the Midwest, and hopefully, it's in a rural area, not by Chicago. If you are imaginative,  creative and flexible and do a ton of checking out of every possibility that would be suitable to house a horse, you can come up with a pretty sweet deal sometimes! As far as tack, you do not need everything new. Craigslist, which I love, has been great for me finding tack or online free classifieds that list horses and tack, or tack shops that you can find anywhere.|`|tWsmxW9taa	I also live in central WI and the board at my barn recently went up from $150 to $165 for rough board. It's a little over $200 for stall. HOLY COW?!? $1000/mo in CA?!? That's crazy. It depends where you live, apparently.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	Normally $200.00 for pasture board  and $250.00 for stall board  I stable with indoor and outdorr arenas and tack is provided sounds pretty top notch, so it might be more expensive.|`|z3Ae5s1xaa	I go to college in NW Tennessee which is semi-close to Ill.  I board my horse at a local barn that supplies a stall, has an awesome round pen, 24-hour lit arena, and tons of trails.  I do supply the feed and hay, but there is a tack shop on the grounds that sells feed, hay, and shavings.  It is only $50 a month.  It is a great deal though!|`|0yPN1XeWaa	Its dependent upon location. I live in Colorado so I would think you would have somewhat similar prices. I used to board my old horse at a facility w/ an indoor and out door arena and they feed hay and grain to my horse twice a day for $500/month when I kept her in a stall w/ a run. When I moved her to an outdoor paddock further off from the main barn is was $400/month. That was on the high end of boarding rates, because the barn was located only 15mins from downtown Denver.    I am looking for a new place and most facilities further out charge about $200-225/month for pasture, $250-300/month for a paddock, and $300-400 for a stall w/ a run. It just depends the further away from the city the cheaper the price...I found a few barns an hour outside of denver that only charge $200 for a stall with a run.    Also, its better to get your own tack if you have your own horse. It's a worth while investment to keep your horse healthy and sound. It could cost you $200 to get a bridle and saddle or up to $2000 dollars just for a saddle just depends on the brand and type of saddle you get. Besides, I don't think I have ever heard of a barn that leases out tack with the exclusion of lounging equipment maybe.|`|vfhKkiSKaa	Depends on where you live and what type of facilities you want to have.  I live just over the IL boarder in SE Wisconsin and I pay $360/month.  If I were to travel the 10 miles and move this same exact barn there it would run around $500/month.
RCyvGAONaa	Your fish won't die from the change in temperature just think when they're in the wild the temperature in the water changes all the time they don't have a constant heater going lol so don't worry they should be fine, I'd say your tank is still a bit high id knock it down to 26/27 and that will be great for your fish, your tank only ever needs to be at 28 if you get a disease such as white spot and then you crank the temperature up to get the diesease into the water enabling you to treat it effectively. <br>  <br>  Loach's are mysterious creatures they do as they please. My loach sometimes hides for days on end and doesn't come out and other times he's there sucking away at everything. So again don't worry if he wants to suck he'll suck if not he'll do whatever else he feels like doing. <br>  <br>  Hope this has helped = )|`|OWi8rvn6aa	If you keep your heater at a setting around 25C it should be fine. Your tank temperature also depends on the room temperature (maybe you had a heater on) and outdoor temperature. So keep it at 25C and if it falls and rises it will still be in the temperature region that the fish can be comfortably with. <br>  <br>  Your fish will not die because the temperature is steadily falling/increasing meaning there are not sudden temperature changes that will shock the fish. Fish will adapt when temperature is slowly increasing/falling within a certain temperature range. <br>  <br>  Your sucker loach has to rest at time to time and can even spend all day hiding and resting. When they suck algae off the glass it does require a bit of energy for the fish. Also sucker loaches normally spend the day resting and come out at night and start looking for something to eat. <br>  <br>  Good luck Hope this has helped!|`|BMri9tITaa	All the temperature fluctuations is probably stressing your loach out.  Once you get the temperature stabilized your fish should be fine.|`|wx2UfKOdaa	first dont worry ur fish will not die... second ya its normal for the sucker cat fish
2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	You say he "acts up all the time" and "won't let anyone take off his halter when in the pasture".      Have you spent any time working with this horse on the ground?  Spending some time with him just with a halter and lead rope and doing some simple ground exercises would help him gain respect for you and the leadership you need to provide for him if you expect things to go well between you when you're riding him.  Most people have a tendency to just saddle up and go without having built a more solid foundation by teaching the horse about you on the ground first.      Training your horse is all about communication.  Horses don't lie and they don't have hidden agendas to be "bad".  They do whatever is expedient for their safety and well-being.  That's why it's a good idea to spend time with them on the ground first, not only to establish your leadership and gain their respect, but to let them get to know you and you them.  It actually builds trust so they feel safe and unthreatened in any way by you.            Horses are smart and sensitive creatures.  The best learning atmosphere for a horse is calmness and consistency.  It takes patient step by step training to accomplish lasting results.  Good horse trainers learn to feel when the horse is ready for the next step.      How long does training a horse take?  As long as it takes.    I wouldn't necessarily give up on your horse just yet.  If you're willing to spend some time working with your horse on the ground, you may end up with a better horse than you thought he was.|`|CgEjK7NGaa	Whether you keep or sell him is your decision, but if you choose to keep him, Immediately contact a trainer in your area.  If this horse is beyond your skill level, it's dangerous for you to be on him right now.    He may only be suitable for an experienced rider, or he may just need a "tune up" to be suitable for you.    A good trainer should be able to work with him, and help you decide if selling him is the right answer.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	I hate to point this out but every time we ride or work with our horses wee training them. Is it possible you have trained him to act as he is now?  Maybe some time with a trainer and riding instructor would be a good investment.|`|MUfMJYHGaa	This is the advice I always give my clients.   1Visit the horse 3 times. You will always miss something the first time.  2Have the owner and someone at the horses riding level ride the horse in front of you. If it's "beginner's "horse, you should have seen it work under a beginner.   3Have someone with experience go with you and work the horse. But make sure they are working for you and not the seller  4Try and see the horse earlier than your expected time  or show up unannounced (just driving by, thought I'd drop in!)  5Don't let the horse out of your sight when you visit. It only takes 10 seconds to hit a horse with a needle if you're good at it  .6always vet check the horse if you don't personally know it's health history.  Or bring out a farrier, they can spot a lameness real quick.  Your horse may just be adjusting badly. Check his diet ,too much grain? Not enough turn out time? And ask someone who is more experienced to work with him awhile. You though he was a good horse for some reason. It may still be there. As long as he isn't dangerous, give him 30 days, he just may need some "turn around  time."|`|L2rivPUWaa	This is a tough one. The main question to begin with is:  Do you actually like this horse's personality?  Perhaps have an instructor come around, or even ride him themselves and see how he behaves for someone else.  Some horses click with some people and others don't. Don't feel bad if he doesn't work out, there are plenty more out there that I'm sure will be a perfect match.  Best of luck          http://www.horserides.org|`|ADjeuxIiaa	There are a number of things that can be making him act up. If you rode him before you bought him, then you know what he can be like. You more than likely would have noticed if he had been drugged if you rode him faster than a walk. He would have been tripping and slow to respond to commands. Do a walkthrough of where he is now. Make sure there are no things that make have him spooked. Also keep in mind that this is all new to him. He has been dropped into a new setting and it is unfamiliar to him which lowers his confidence. He doesn't know you. Give him a week or two to get settled, then try to earn his trust with praise and treats. Go slow with training.     When I train I make it a rule of thumb to repeat whatever I am teaching until they get it right. The first time he gets it, he is done for the day. For halter training, start where he is most comfortable (ex: his stall) Try to take it off. If he is good, let him have a sugar cube, carrot, or slice of fruit. Stop for the day. The next day repeat. This way he associates you taking his halter off with him being rewarded. The following day, repeat. Only this time, do it in the pasture.     Alwas remember, never punish with pain, reward with pleasure!    What we lack in knowledge, we try to make up for with strength.|`|0yPN1XeWaa	I was in a very similar situation when I got my old horse. We had even put her on trial for 2 weeks, before we purchased her, but I was too young and inexperinced to catch the warning signs of a dangerous horse.    My horse was an off the track TB mare. She wouldn't tie, and had a nasty habbit of tacking off and rearing. On one occasion she actually flipped over backwards, and for a good year the people who owned the barn I boarded at wouldn't allow her inside the barn w/ other horses!    I decided to keep her, becuase I didn't think it was responsible to sell her in such a condition, plus I loved her. I hired a John Lyons certified trainer to help me with her. I worked with the trainer for I think almost 2 years. I learned A LOT. Over all I think it was the best/most educational experience I ever had as a rider. By the time I had to quit riding and eventually sell her I was leasing her out to an 8y/o beginner rider at my barn. Thats how sound and quite she became.    In the end its up to you. If you keep your horse I would strongly advise seeking the help of a professional trainer to teach you how to properly handle him. Just from my own experience I would suggest someone in Natural Horsemanship. Its a big commitment, and also very expensive to pay for the trainer. With time, patients and persistance any horse can be rideable and safe. It is all just a matter of how much time you are willing to give to work with him.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Yes I think you should sell him. I would try getting a new horse, but this time make sure you test ride him or make sure you can buy a horse that can be leased at your house for 1 month so you can really tell if he's the horse for you. It's hard to sell horses right now, but if your definite you could sell him I really think you should. Make sure you tell the new buyers everything about him and how he's not the best horse or else you'll be selling them a bad horse without their understanding.  Oh you did test him out. Well that can change in a heartbeat, so this time lease a horse for a month at your house then decide if you want it. Your dad is right he could have been being drugged so some one would buy him, and if you lease a horse for a month no one can get to him but you and your family and you'll get to see the real horse.
AE7W7Jspaa	although this is not your dog, you could attempt to train the dog yourself and avoid the problems.  Your other option...find a new residence.
AQsiugSpaa	Interesting question about why cats are nocturnal but they are also considered to be crepuscular, which means they can be most active at dusk or early dawn. Most folks consider cats to be "nocturnal" by nature, however.    All felines are preditors by nature, and hunt at night. It is instinctive behavior. And while this is their nature, cats kept as pets or fed by humans, continue this behavior, although they may sleep with their people most of the night. They will often awaken during the night and are easy to rouse.    One of the best things to do with "bouncing off the wall cats" is to play actively with them before bedtime, feed a bedtime snack, and they will generally settle down and sleep more soundly.    Cats actually will sleep between 14-18 hours a day. Their metabolism requires it.

This is because their vision is best suited to low light, making dusk and dawn ideal times for them to go hunting.    Most of the big cats follow a similar sleeping pattern except for the cheetah, who hunts during the daytime in an effort to avoid lions and leopards.|`|2zGKZB6gaa	My cats sleep at night... Play all day. running running jumping wrestling running.... And then they sleep some more between like 2 PM and 6 ish... And then they play and play and play some more. Until everyone goes to bed and then they sleep. Guess I'm lucky.
hJAtgbb8aa	Yes I was and I still am....but not because of what kind of animals they are, but because of what kind of personality they have.<br>  I've been an animal lover ever since I can remember. People at school used to make fun of me, and so did my cousins, because I'm the quiet kind of person who has a wild heart.<br>  I was always fascinated by animals, and used to get jealous if someone had a pet and I didn't.<br>  I used to watch the Discovery channel when I was young and used to love all the animals, but also feared them.<br>  I got my first pets when I was 4 or 5....2 bunnies, Jasmine and Flora.<br>  They were white and cute...but I've always feared that they'll bite my, cause they had sharp teeth, and my mom would force me to stay away from them. I would touch them once in a while, but back off fast, cause I didn't know them.<br>  I realized that I should have tried to socialize with them after they died a year later.<br>  Then my dad got me a Monkey. I was afraid of Abu for a first few days, cause my cousins scared me...they said monkeys bite your fingers off and eat them. Abu was only 6 months old and she was nothing like those monkeys at least...I used to pat her head everyday and she stayed down looking at my hand, and wouldn't move. She didn't know me well enough, but never attacked anyone.<br>  She got stolen after 3 months (Bangladesh is full of thieves and you can never catch them).<br>  And now I regret for not picking her up and hugging her. I feel that I was stupid to believe my people.<br>  Also, after 5 years or so, a wild monkey arrived on the rooftop of our building...it was really wild and seemed like it would attack anyone within range. My cousins didn't let me go near it, but I could have sworn it was her, but she looked scary...she left in an hour or so.<br>  After Abu, dad got me a parrot. Toto was totally different. He wouldn't ever make a sound for some reason, unlike all other parrots scream and make sounds. He would even look at me when I fed him. I was always afraid of his sharp beak. I got him a partner, Mira...who died very soon. I don't know why, but she from the very first day would drink a lot of water. I had to fill in the water bowl every 2 hours. Toto was never like that.<br>  After Mira's death, Toto seemed lonely again. He died a year later, and now I regret being scared of him. He was not at all dangerous. I remember weeping over his dead body. I buried him myself, and planted a rose plant on his grave.<br>  My dad got me 2 more parrots, but I let them go because they reminded me of Toto a lot.<br>  Then I got fishes....8 of them, but they required too much of work, so I gave them to my cousin who had over 25 fishes in his huge aquarium...and one goldfish is still alive. =)<br>  One day, I noticed that a nest of baby crows (2 weeks old) fell off our coconut tree. 4 were already dead, and only one survived. I hated crows, cause they used to peck on my head if I went near the coconut tree (when the mama laid the eggs). But the chick seemed so lonely and honestly, there were no adult crows to take care of it. I just couldn't see it die like that. I carried it in a big basket, and kept him under a big reservoir tank on the rooftop...it was the kid of environment the crows liked, and y mom wouldn't find out I kept a crow...she hates them.<br>  I loved him a lot, because I remember feeding him with my own hands when he woke up and opened his mouth straight up and cried. I poured some powdered rice into it, and then some water. The crow survived, and one day, he was gone. I though he'll come back, but he didn't.<br>  My cousin wanted to get rid of his canaries, so I took them for him...I raised them well, and let them go. Meanwhile, I also got 2 stray cats. they had 3 kittens. The parents left the kittens when they were about 3 months old. I dunno where they disappeared, and so I looked after the kittens. I was always afraid of cats, because I got scratches by stray ones before. But these kittens never did anything to me. I had to give them away to my friend because we were going to move to UAE.<br>  I got 2 budgies in UAE, and they reminded me of Toto, and I played with them. I held them, let them sit on my fingers, and let them go one day.<br>  I got hamsters after that. I was really scared of Fluffy and Mooshy, cause they bit me several times, yet I didn't give up socializing with them, because i blame myself for not having a good bond with my ex-pets because of my fears. I tried and tied. Mooshy died shortly after having babies. I raised all her pups and gave them away (she had 6 and I had Fluffy already) and Fluffy would have killed them. I got several bites from those pups, yet I knew I can train them to be more decent.<br>  Misha is the only hamster I kept from that litter, and now I have 3 hamsters. Fluffy, Misha, and her son Junior, and NONE have bitten me for 5+ months. (11+ in case of Misha).<br>  Yet I'm afraid of other hamsters in the pet stores, because I don't know them and they don't know me.<br>  <br>  I forgot to mention my hen.<br>  I had her for a year, and I used to play with her and fed her cockroaches...lol. She was wonderful. I hate eating chicken after her death.<br>  <br>  So I need to overcome the fear by taking care of them.<br>  I'll be getting a rat after the summer holidays.

I am blessed with a VERY animal loving dad and mom! I was born into a house FULL of animals. My mom had a cat, a frog, a iguana, a 250 pound mastiff!! He was the size of a pony. My dad had 2 cats, 4 dogs, an iguana and a bird, Mice and rats and oh i could go on and on! I was born into an animal loving house. I grew up with my 250 pound horse oops i mean mastiff lol. When i was 8 years old me and my dad where so crazy in one house with 3 kids and 2 parents we had 25 pets!!! Omg the house was a zoo it was fun!! We have had about every breed you can think of dog and cat. I have always loved animals from day one. Because of my parents. All are 25 pets where all rescues, my parents where rescue people if theres a stray my parents are all over it :D<br>  <br>  Oh and we spent more money on the animals then are selfs LOL. Every time we went out it was getting bones for all the dogs, getting toys for all the kitties, getting treats for the birds, getting food for the fish, getting tofu for the reptiles, getting blocks for the mice etc etc :D

Get the dog of Hills ANYTHING! It is a **** brand put it on something like Innova, Wellness, or EVO much better. Anything from a grocery store is bad.<br>  Step 2. Watch your dog constantly. Either carry a spray bottle or use your hands and when ever there is bad behavior say NO! REALLY LOUD and clap or spray the dog, for the next 10 minutes give the dog NO attention unless it continues the behavior, if you give him attention he will think it's a good thing.<br>  Good Luck!
QVP8zSuWaa	Do not use any type of human shampoo. Get a nice dog shampoo, if they have any skin issues there are special shampoos.  You always start at the head and work your way back. Fleas will run to the face to escape the water. Do not get water in the ears. Wash face front and back of the neck and work your way back. Rinse until clear. Quickly put a towel over them to avoid a major shower. I try to get allot of the water off of them before you get them out of the tub, clean up all that hair, repeat.    Have fun.  They make a little round plastic brush that fits on your hand for the GS.|`|h2HtZ9NMaa	The proper way to bathe a large breed do is to make sure that their fur is fully wet. Then shampoo them for at l;eat 5 minutes make sure to squeeze the paws because that is the place that holds most of the dirt. Then rinse them thoroughly. Repeat the shampoo. Then Condition until their fur is nice and hydrated. When done make sure to blow dry and make sure to brush to get all the extra hair out of their fur. GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	Make sure you use a good quality shampoo- not one that will leave a lot of residue on the dog's fur.    Your best bet is to start by brushing both dogs out.  Removing most of the dirt with a brush before hand will make the bath much easier and more successful, especially with the German Shepherd.    Be sure when bathing your dogs to do so safetly- if you intend on bathing them in a tub, find a way to strap them in so they don't escape and slip all over the floor or hurt you and themselves in their attempt to break free.    I usually wash my dogs with shampoo once, rinse, wash again, then apply coat conditioner or a special shampoo if needed.  Try getting them as dry as possible with a towl, then use a hair dryer to finish the job- wet dogs pick up dirt like a magnet, so if you let them run around the house wet you're just going to have to bathe them again.    Good luck!|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	I honestly didn't think bathing was that complicated! LOL    I just toss 'em (not literally) in the bathtub, wet them down, squirt 'em with dog shampoo, scrub it in really good, and rinse.  Towel dry, and let 'em run around the house.  (I guess I should mention my house is clean enough to let my dogs run around damp-- They've never gotten dirty-- and if that's a problem with someone else, they need to worry more about cleaning their house than their dog.)    My dogs are pitbulls, I would imagine the GSD's coat is obviously thicker and longer and may need more attention when it comes to lathering with shampoo.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Just get them in the shower (1 at a time) with you and just really wet them down and put the doggy shampoo all over them.It would be easier if you bought one of the nozzles you attach to your shower head so it's easier to get the shampoo out..Make sure to not get water in the ears and eyes..It will be messy and a lot of hair will be coming out for days as you loosen the hair underneath.I like to brush them before and then again outside when they have been dried off|`|elxZLQLQaa	buy some dog shampoo and put then on a non slip tabvle and spread around there hole entire body then wash them down with a water hose|`|ktdpOM8Maa	Scrub 'em down, just like you would yourself. If you don't want to get specific dog shampoo, baby shampoo works fine as a substitute.     Also, it's a good idea to plug their ears with cotton balls so they don't get water in their ears, since dogs are prone to ear infections.|`|HPgMTnJ3aa	do it your self|`|TS4MjnWqaa	first play out side with the hose and have some fun put out a lil soap and then rinse them off and dry them. or take them to the groomer|`|6zA0jR6Saa	bathing depends on your dog,   what they are most comfortable with is the best way.  I suggest your tub   or if you have a heated garage to do it in a large container in there.  Dog shampoo is sold just about anywhere, 7/11, food market, pet store    use enough soap so that there is a thin lather, work it into their fur just like you would do yourself.  Careful around the eyes and ears,  its not terrible if you get soap in there but try not to.  repeat only if you visibly see dirt still comming out of their fur.  Rinse, and make sure those pups stay warm with a towle dry (its blizzarding where I live so I feel like I should mention it)    I bath my pit every 2-3 months    o and make sure u get them used to the water  some dogs get skittish    while your at it, you may want to also clip their nails and clean out their ears
D1beU6MPaa	If she is sneaking food that she is not used to, it is probably the cause. But it could also be parasites. Try feeding her this, and do not let her have anything else. Cook some chicken and shred it up. Cook some white rice, minute rice is fine. Mix the chicken and rice together, nothing else for flavor. Feed her this, and only this. If it is the food she has been eating, this should clear it up. If not, she needs to see the vet. Good luck to you|`|ra69rxxgaa	A change in your dogs diet could cause this.|`|Lq4LXs7kaa	puppies have very sensitive stomaches.try changing her diet and just call up the vet and ask.she could have a digestive track problem and it also could be fro her steeling ur friend's dog's food.call the vet|`|YjiteF2gaa	Hey it might be the food but maybe not. It might be the food because her body isn't use to your roommate type of food. She could have eaten something bad that her stomach rejected and no she is popping it out. You should look up information  on the internet or call a vet. You should ask your roommate if she fed your dog anything that you don't know about. hOPE SHE FEELS BETTER
u7vrul2Faa	They can estimate the age roughly by checking the cats teeth and eyes and by the general condition of the coat and claws of the cat. Sometimes the cat may have some notes on its history eg from a microchip if it has one or from medical notes or from any info provided by previous owners if it ever had any.|`|c0a5c8943ce6f1d0df1e342f2f780150aa	Their teeth- length, color, and condition.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Normally when a Vet checks their age they look at their teeth and can tell by the growth of the canine teeth.  Oftentimes though it's a guestimate because you won't truly know their age unless you catch them just as the baby canine teeth come out.  Their baby canine's come out at 4 months old.|`|NTEuxMVmaa	The vet can tell by looking at the teeth.The teeth have lines on them so the vet can judge by this.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Often times they cant.  Sometimes a cat is microchipped and the chip was never registered, sometimes they speak with the original owners and find out that way, but most of the time they just guess based on growth and their teeth.
4aAhEK9daa	People tend to let cats wander and irresponsibly don't spay and neuter them so you end up with lots of unwanted litters.  And a large percentage of those litters are cats that don't have owners - feral cats - so they go on to breed, and breed, and breed.  People don't tend to just let their dogs loose in the neighbourhood and are probably more likely to spay and neuter dogs.|`|FfBll2n8aa	Cats breed more quickly than dogs. Also, cats are generally less controlled by their owners - they are allowed to roam, where dogs are usually confined to a property and don't get the chance to mate so often.<br>  From what I see, it's much cheaper (often free) to obtain a cat, which means they have less "value" than dogs, in monetary terms. This means some owners are not as likely to desex their cats, as they aren't prepared to pay money for something for an animal they got for nothing.<br>  The problem shelters have is that they get sometimes three or four times the cats that they get of dogs - ie for every dog they take in, they also take in three or four cats. Because cats are so plentiful, and there are so many of them being offered in the papers etc for free, there literally aren't enough people wanting cats, to house them all. <br>  The reason big dogs are rehomed more slowly than small is that big dogs only appeal to certain people - those who have larger houses, larger properties, don't rent and who don't mind a big dog in their car or around the house. The majority of people prefer a smaller dog, so they're more popular.|`|ncPT0jnVaa	I suspect it is regional. In my area, I can tell you that almost no apartments will rent to people with big dogs. Small dogs maybe, cats are easiest.|`|CT9AOpb4aa	you can see that more cats wonder outside then dogs|`|VGLauPEkaa	Cats can reproduce far more often than dogs. Basically, right after the queen weans the kittens, she can breed again. In fact, if the kittens are lost, she can breed again immediately if stimulated by a male.<br>  <br>  So basically, people let their cats out (because having an indoor only cat seems to be oh-so-cruel to so many people). Cats, being less domesticated than dogs, can live on their own and hunt and feed themselves. They then breed and create more cats. Who can physically breed at 3-6 months. Therefore, more cats are created. So, there are more and more cats going into the shelter when they do pick them up, and they get very little time to find a home (less than dogs), and thus have less a chance of being adopted.<br>  <br>  There's also the fact that most people look in the papers or on Craigslist for cats, but don't think about the shelters. Most people think of dogs when it comes to shelter. Hence "Dog pound" or "Dog shelter" instead of 'animal pound'.<br>  <br>  Also, take in the fact that a lot of people go to private rescues instead of shelters, too.<br>  <br>  It's not that cats are considered disposable. It's just that there are so many of them, they can breed so often and so early. Dogs can breed twice a year (only once for some breeds) and can't actually breed until 6months to a year old. Cats are way more adapted to expanding in colonies.|`|efQZOwEPaa	l think it's cats just breed 3 times faster than dogs that's why there is so manny|`|AA11457471	Yes. Very sad but true. There are just so many of them that it's very difficult to find enough good homes.<br>  The ones older than 3yrs. barely stand a chance.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Cats can breed at a faster rate than most dogs. Most people do not get them fixed so they cycle just continues. Our Humane Society was doing a special adopt one cat and get one for free over valentines day. Dogs just came with some extra stuff.
TgNQAYyXaa	If the teeth are clean and the gum's healthy, why would you want to brush your dogs teeth?<br>  <br>  I am sure wolves brush their teeth twice a day, in both directions and then gargle to avoid plaque.......NOT........<br>  <br>  Give them raw meaty bones and you will never have to brush their teeth.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	How often? Should be every day, yet twice a week would do.<br>  IS it bad to never brush your dogs teeth? Yes...they can develop gingivitis, which can progress to peridontal disease, which can further progress to losing teeth.<br>  How do you brush your dogs teeth? Just the best you can lol. She can have her mouth closed and you can at least do the outside of the teeth by sticking the toothbrush (with toothpaste made for dogs) along the inside of her cheek.|`|26PPwzrWaa	If you dont feed raw meaty bones, yes it is important. <br>  <br>  Biweekly. <br>  <br>  They get used to it as you do it more. Whatever you do, dont stop until you are done, then praise with treats.|`|5d0588fa97d047676b038c38ba3e0cd3aa	Yes, it's important.<br>  <br>  Apart from the risk of their teeth becoming rotten, gum disease etc, there is the risk of infection getting into the bloodstream and affecting the kidneys.<br>  <br>  If your dog doesn't take too kindly to a brush (and to be honest, most don't at first!), try some of those dentistix. There's something called "Logic Gel" that is available from your vet, which you just put a small amount into your dog's mouth.<br>  <br>  Try to get your dog used to being touched around the mouth. Lots of praise for him allowing you to touch his muzzle. Once she's learned to accept that, move on to lifting up their lips to reveal the teeth - working slowly towards eventually allowing you to (gently) brush them.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	Well i do something thats very crazy with my dog. And im sure im going to get alot of Thumbs down for this. With my dog Mr. Mustard, I put a ball in his mouth, so i have full access to all of his teeth, and i take a small knife, and scrape the tarter off of his teeth. Then i brush his teeth with doggie toothpaste. His teeth before i did them myself were full of tarter, and now, they look perfect, white, and polished. Im extremely precise, and careful when i scrape his teeth, and im lucky to have a dog that is very mellow, and patient enough, to sit through the whole thing. I do this at least once a week every time i groom him, or once a month|`|qzPZf2XPaa	Yes I brush my dogs teeth.<br>  And... I do it the way Lisa does, for me it is easiest and my dogs understand the gesture and stop fidgeting.|`|sxk08R2caa	Yes. You should aim to do it at least twice  a week so then you can prevent gum disease. I would advise giving your dog a denti stick every day after his/her dinner so your dog can 'brush' his teeth without you actually doing it. The denti stick keeps your dog healthy and it keeps your dogs jaw normal (because of all the chewing they have to do). It also acts like a mouthwash for dogs. Also denti sticks have an apealling taste to dogs so they are none the wiser.<br>  <br>  So yes you need to brush your dogs teeth and I advise buying the denti stick!|`|x3T7otTDaa	I have a tip that could possibly be helpful but it might just depend on the dog. If you take your thumb and put it under her tongue and hold her teeth you can pretty much get her to hold still. Try not to pull or press too hard on her teeth. If you really can't get her to do it I've heard the DentiBones work really well and they come in different flavors that dogs like.|`|eq5qPnRGaa	Very important.  Dogs can suffer from tooth decay, tooth abscesses and gum disease just like humans can; and when dog's teeth go bad, they don't usually go get a filling or a root canal, they have to have the tooth pulled permanently.<br>  <br>  In addition dental problems can cause bad breath, contribute to digestive problems and heart disease, and start systemic infections.  Daily brushing is ideal, as are yearly dental cleanings by your vet.<br>  <br>  Dogs will fight having their teeth brushed at first, but if you keep with it, they'll learn to behave for it.<br>  <br>  While you're at it: make sure her diet consists of high quality kibble (keeps teeth cleaner than moist food) and never give food or treats that contain sweeteners (like corn syrup) you'd be surprised how many treats are full of sugar.  Sugar rots dogs teeth just like it rots ours.|`|BpKECFBSaa	I used to brush my dogs teeth, but she hated it and I got sick of her trying to bite my hand, so, now I just give her rawhides which work great! They clean their teeth to a point, but every few years, you should take your dog into the vet to get a Dental. But, if you have a little dog (smaller than 25lbs) I would brush their teeth once or twice a week. Good Luck! Hope this helped!|`|tbWPtZ76aa	its good to brush ur dogs teeth u should brush it twice a week or even everyday which is good
d517e237c5cdbdd38c8b5a471b607dc0aa	You could try any pet store, local independent or chain. They should have a variety of cat collar bells. You shouldn't go too large, though, because your cat probably wouldn't like having a huge bell hanging around her neck. Most of them don't usually even like the small ones until they get used to them.<br>  <br>  If you mean the costume is for you and not your cat (which I'm sure would make your cat happier), you could try a place like the Christmas Tree Stores. They have large jingle bell type bells, and those look like the bells on cats' collars, only larger. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|9Ce6izucaa	Easiest is a place that sells Christmas decorations.<br>  <br>  Or try craft/hobby specialty stores. <br>  <br>  Also some costume shops might have bells.<br>  <br>  Or you could make your own from a ball|`|ncPT0jnVaa	A craft store?

179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	A little ear cut doesn't sound like something that warrants an immediate vet trip, and by now, it's far too late to do anything, IF the dog needed stitches, you have to do it within 6 hours (if I remember correctly), otherwise there's no point, scar tissue has already begun to form.    If it's already scabbed over, you're not doing anything to help it by applying something that moistens the scab.  The purpose of the scab is to allow healing, and when you mess with that, you're only prolonging the heal time.    If it's already scabbed, leave it alone, in a few weeks, it'll be fine.  Just be sure to watch for signs of infection (redness around the wound, heat coming from the wound, oozing any fluids) and THEN you'll need to take the dog to the vet for antibiotic treatment.|`|0hTvKlD5aa	I would say that it's vet time nao.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Why hasn't he been to the doctor?

Restricting their food will only cause them ill-health. You should not try to control their size, if you want to have a smaller snake, get a cornsnake. It is cruel to deprive them of food to attempt to keep the snake at a more manageable length.     Some new morphs of retic are 'super dwarfs' and supposedly reach smaller lengths, around 12-15 feet, but this is no guarantee and should not be treated as a definite. There will always be an exception thrown in by mother nature to keep us all on our toes!    Another point, a snake will not grow to the size of it's enclosure if you try to keep it in a smaller one. It will only make it uncomfortable.  Reptiles grow throughout their lives, after they have stopped noticeably growing.     Please do not try to control their growth, as I said before, get a smaller, more easy to cope with snake.|`|k2l20XdFaa	If you want a reticulated python you need to go to this site Bobclark.com. He is the retic guru. A super dwarf retic is born smaller than a ball python when it is born. You will pay more money for these snakes but they shouldn't get more than six feet or so. I am actually thinking of getting one myself. I would also not recommend feeding a retic any less than what it wants. They are always hungry and ready to eat. Hope this helps.|`|4ec0358cc8edb8d33f2bb919053d9aceaa	there are a lot of dwarf retics now that only get like 10 feet in length. but a regular retic no matter what will end up reaching 20+ feet
dJovtDdzaa	Just be watchful for developing symptoms over next 24-48 hrs.  My cat ate fat black ponytail bands while I thought he was just playing with them.He started walking around crying occasionally the next day, then more frequently the next day & evening. When he starting throwing up at 3 am that night, crying constantly & loudly, we rushed him to our vet. He took x-rays & then to surgery, where he removed about 10 fat bands & few smaller colored ones. He said our alertness saved our cat's life. Ponytail bands & the large hair bands are outlawed at our house, but he still manages to find one now & then (I see them in his feces). He doesn't treat rubber bands the same, so I suspect he likes the spongy ones. Keep your ties in safe place locked or sealed & out of sight.Be watchful for tummy aches, crying, & vomiting mostly liquid & take to vet asap if symptoms develop. Better be safe than cat-less. No problem now, just keep an eye on her.|`|VGLauPEkaa	See, my cats have eaten some of my hair ties before, and they passed without a problem. I didn't even know it until I cleaned the litter box. They've also eaten their cat toys.<br>  <br>  I'd call the vet, just to make sure they feel it's okay, and if they want you to come in, then do it. But I think it'll be fine.

I hope everything goes well.|`|AA11589437	what was the hair tie like? If it is like a simple rubber band, it will pass. Otherwise, it may block her intestine, but that will not happen immediately, it will happen in the next 48 hours. Does the item look like it is small enough to fit in your cat's poo?<br>  Anyway, keep an eye on her for the next few days. Check her poo for the items she ate, to see if it came out. Also, check that she eats OK, and mostly that she poops OK. If she doesn't poop or if she vomits, go to the vet immediately.
6rNosWZMaa	My now 14-year old border collie, Dudley, contracted auto-immune hemolytic anemia almost 4 years ago. I was out of town on business so it was lucky that my husband noticed the sudden and drastic changes in his behaviour and activity level. Also luckily, our vet had recently dealt with this disease so was familiar with the symptoms and immediately knew the tests that needed to be done to confirm her diagnosis. We were fortunate that he responded to large doses of prednisone and other IV meds and saw improvement within a few days. Sorry, I can't recall the names of the others. He continued on prednisone for about 10 weeks and it took about 4 months for him to get back to his old self although his energy level was never quite the same after that.  About 18 months after the first incident, we started seeing the same symptoms again so immediately took him to our vet. Although he didn't appear to be as sick as he was the first time, his white count was significantly lower and we discovered his life was at great risk already. She started him on prednisone but he did not respond, then she put him on a drug that is commonly used for chemotherapy to try to suppress his immune system. He continued to get sicker. After 5 days, she was afraid he wasn't going to survive more than a few days so she told us his only hope was to receive a blood transfusion, although she felt his chance of survival was very slight. Our whole family said our tearful good-byes to him as she hadn't given us much hope that this would work. Much to our amazement his white count started to improve. Each day he improved a little bit more. I'm happy to report that more than 2 years after the second attack, our Dudley is still with us -- as healthy and happy as a 14-year-old BC can be. We are so grateful to have him and look at every day he's with us as a true blessing.  Dudley is the only dog our vet has treated that has survived a 2nd bout of this horrible disease.  At the clinic they call him "Dudley the Miracle Dog".  Each round of complete treatment cost us about $3,500, also well worth it.  I wish we knew what caused it. Our vet feels there's a high probability he may contract it again. Every day we check him over to see if there are any early symptoms -- so far, so good.  We live in Calgary, AB (Canada); where are you?

It is never fun to adopt a pet just to get caught and have to find a different place for them.  In fact, it sucks.

I don't doubt your ability to care for it or how much you would love it, its simply a legal issue.

SIhxrxD3aa	There are many that are older than that.  There are several reasons why it appears to be that way though    What typically happens though is that the longer a doctor works in a practice the more loyal clients he gets and the fuller the schedule and you as a new client will most likely have to see the young new doctor.    Also, large animal vets are typically of the older generation and the younger generation is specializing in small animal instead which is leading to a shortage of large animal vets.    Another reason is that the job is very physically demanding, so as the vet gets older they might sell their practice and take a job in research, teaching or government work where they have to do less heavy lifting and other strenuous tasks.|`|P9oP8CS9aa	The pressure is intense, so professional burnout is very high in this field.|`|lW1rCecnaa	because they make such good money they can retire early, it is a fact that most people will spend money faster on their animals than they will their kids.
hQIqEnTEaa	A rubber bit is good for horses with sensitive mouths.    I would not recommend a rubber bit for a horse with no brakes as you don't have as much control as with a metal bit.     On the other hand rubber bits are very kind and are effective. I ride my  TB in a rubber bit X-country and have no problems. If your horse will listen to you with a rubber bit then go for it as it is far kinder.     However, if you want to do hacking or dressage then you will need a metal bit as well and you may not want to train and compete in 2 different bits (although I do this and have no problems).|`|xO1ICZYIaa	if your horse has a sensitive mouth, rubber is good. but rubber tastes HORRIBLE to a horse. if you do want rubber, i'd suggest getting a flavored bit, its flavored (obviously) and tastes good.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	ONES METTAL AND ONE'S RUBBER|`|RloOJ43haa	What is the problem with the D-ring snaffle? Is he resisting it? If so, in what way? Do you want a full cheek just for help on the turns? Why are you thinking rubber bit? To be more gentle?     You can try him in the rubber bit to see how he goes. He may or may not like it.|`|4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	Think from the horses' perspective.    One can find rubber-coated bits that are flavored.  Kelly sells apple flavored bits.    Often, people will start a young horse in a rubber bit to avoid injury to his teeth or bit path, then they might graduate to a metal bit.    some considerations are these:  - The rubber bit can actually be a larger diameter - if the horse's mouth is shallow, narrow or small, the added diameter can be very uncomfortable to them.    - If the bit is flavored or the horse doesn't like the flavor, they can become more focused on the taste of the bit and less focused on the cues it's being used to give.    You must recognize what your goals are for making a change.  If the bit you are currently using is working fine and the horse is responding well, what would be the reason to change it?  If the bit is not working, and the horse is exhibiting bit resistance, you must try to figure out why the resistance, is it the bit or is it the way you're using it?    A D-ring snaffle is a widely accepted bit for starting horses in.  The bit isn't a whole lot different in the way it works from a full cheek.  I'd be curious to know why you're going from a D-ring to a full cheek.    Mouthpieces can be made of many things:  - Stainless steel - is a hard metal that keeps it's shape for a long time and is easily maintained.  The stainless steel is a metal that tends to make the mouth drier.  - Copper is a soft metal - if a bit is made completely of copper and the horse chomps or plays with it, small gouges can be made which can be uncomfortable to the horse's mouth.  The metal tastes sweet, so encourages salivation.  Too much copper can make a horse who's already got a moist mouth actually foam.  - Sweet Iron - this is an iron that will rust as the horse salivates.  It creates a sweet taste as well.  The bit looks rusty and old after a short amount of time.  - Steel coated in chrome.  Many cheap bits such as those that come with fully put-together bridles like the low ported curbes are usually this - they don't last a long time, the chrome will peel and curl and it becomes a nasty thing.    I prefer stainless steel with copper inserts  - these keep the horse's mouth moist enough without the danger of gouges hurting the horse's mouth.    You must also understand bit mechanics and leverage to make good decisions about bits as well as how to identify bit resistance.  There is much that goes into choice of bits and one could try and try forever and not get the right one for their purposes on their own.    Here is the horsemans' theory on bits: you start with the proper amount of bit to teach the horse the basics.  Often a snaffle bit, which operates via a pinch and gag action, is used to teach a horse to respond.  Later, bits are introduced which use less pinch and gag when the communication is built well and less pain or discomfort is needed to obtain the same result.  A bit is one of many tools and cues used to communicate with the horse and should be viewed as a communication tool, not a control device.    I have found helpful beginnings understanding bits in Dale Myler's book and video "A Whole Bit Better'.  It can be purchased from State Line tack as a set for about $10.  The video show what bit resistance looks like, it gives you some tools to help you understand how the bit feels to the horse and thus why it does what it does as well as perhaps how to use (or not use) a bit for a positive outcome.  The video is more helpful than the book.  The book is more a reference tool to what the Myler bits offer and to help you chose a better or the next bit you'll use to train.     Hopefully I've helped?  The bottom line answer to your question is this:  If the bits are exactly the same, but one has a rubber coated mouth, they function the same - consideration must be given to the diameter of the mouthpiece.  The only benefit rubber may give is to the horse who's been taught the bit hurts by people who've allowed it to clunk their teeth.|`|ngrjFv72aa	i prefer a metal bit, and it doesn't sound like your horse is very sensitive. horses hate rubber bits, so i wouldn't use one unless it was absolutely neccesary. i feel like when  i use a metal one even if its a snaffle i have a better connection with the horse, which especially helps in dressage|`|NJdupXBKaa	If he goes well on the bit he is currently on i would stick with it :)  If he has a sensitive mouth a rubber or happy mouth bit may be better. Go for a flavoured one though.  If you want something to be nicer in his mouth then maybe try a copper or sweet iron metal. These are warmer and often horses go much better from them.   Hope this helps   xx|`|IMPvzBk1aa	If he is used to metal, and has no problem with it, stay with metal.  i prefer copper since it promotes salivation.  I have used full cheek snaffles with copper mouths for years, and several horses have all done well in those bits.
ec1d80b5105e09c381fb6e0b627016c2aa	Depends on what you'd like to do with him.  He looks to be a lovely fox hunting type horse.  If you wanting him to do more of the hunters/equitation type shows he needs to back off the fences a tad.  He seems to get excited and rush some, which scores low in the hunters and will mean rails down at the higher levels of stadium jumping.  I do love that he's so willing and seems to enjoy it that much, i much prefer having a horse be confident and carry me to a fence then worry about pushing one up to fences.  He uses himself well and jumps carefully despite the rushing so i love that about him too.  If he was mine i would go back to trotting into fences, maybe even a month or two of trotting fences to let him see that he can jump from his hip instead of from his momentum up to the fence.  Then i would go to doing some easy grids/gymnastics so he could teach himself to think through the fences and that being collected makes the jumps work better.  A few times of knocking wooden rails in grids because he rushed and chipped or left long will slow him down a bit.  Just don't rush things, he looks like his jumping career may have been hurried like he never trotted fences as a baby and hasn't seen actual grid fences.  I loved you still using trotting poles and pacing poles with him to help him out, keep using them to trot fences and then set up the same concept as lil 2 foot 2'3 grids.|`|nKwcGLQraa	it looks really awesome :).    although, maybe you shouldn't let him get so excited about the jump. It can get very distracting and you will concentrate more on holding him in than on getting over the jump nicely. And if he learned to calm down, you would be able to take nicer, longer strides which will give him more power for when you decide that its time to jump big. Although, when i mean longer strides i don't mean faster, just longer more powerful strides so he can really get his haunches under him.  I know that cavaletti-jumping exercises helps calm down excited horses. Also, making halts (not the ones where you have to use all your force and make it look vicious. nice, soft ones) after each jump helps. both will also strengthen his back and haunches, so it's like two in one :).    and sometimes it looks like you your holding him a lil tight (probably cause he is excited though :P).    otherwise, both of you look great :D.|`|mKWwz1uUaa	Well first I'm gonna say this I don't do jumping:(  But that said I can't help with technique, but I did notice a safety issue, the pallet that you jumped I would be very afraid of him slipping, stalling, missing a step or what ever it's call and a hoof going right through it getting stuck, broken leg, or you being injured I would take that one out of your routine, but he's a lovely horse and you two seem very happy together best of luck and stay safe:)

3FZhgqfNaa	Not all vets have an US machine but they all have an X Ray machine.    When I X Ray, it is because I am concerned the dam may not have a wide enough pelvis for the skulls, in the event I suspect larger puppies.  That way I know ahead of time if I should book a C Section.    I palpate at 28 - 30 days and have never misdiagnosed a pregnancy to date so I don't use either for pregnancy confirmation.  However, not everyone can palpate effectively.    So, if you're looking to confirm pregnancy, an ultrasound is the way to go, By the time an XRay will catch a skeleton (the last 10 days of pregnancy), you usually already know she's pregnant.  If you're wanting to count puppies, an XRay is better, as a b itch could still resorb a puppy after ultrasound.|`|Chxoncy7aa	I usually x-ray vs ultra sound.  I don't know why, it's just what I have always done.  That is what I learned to do when I was young and working for breeders.  Now that I am one, I just continue.  I think both can be inaccurate, depending on how the puppies are in there.  One x-ray I had showed 4 definite puppies.  She had 5.  My vet has always chosen x-ray over ultra sound as well.  However in horses, we always did an ultrasound.  I learned to always x-ray in the case of a puppy not delivered.  A st poodle breeder I had worked for, who had been breeding top show dogs for well over 30 years, almost lost a female.  There was one puppy that had died inside, and not been delivered.  Since then, she had always done x-rays, and has never lost a female or had one so sick.  So in my view it is not a waste of money.  Pregnant females are not sedated for the x-ray.|`|vPde97E2aa	WHY does anybody -who actually KNOWS anything about breeding & whelping-waste money on either??? If you can't tell when labor is complete,you shouldn't be breeding. If you can't tell if it caught,ditto!    An X-ray shows HARD tissue-bone-so one can ACCURATELY count skulls!|`|QUkXsPNIaa	I work in a Vet Clinic as a Nurse on placement, and we alwys do Ultra Sound. I have never heard of using X-Ray to confirm pregnancy, we just wouldn't take the risk with the sedation and radiation.    EDIT: I understand the argument for being able to accurately count skulls in X-Ray; but as a general safety rule; X-ray should only be used when absoluelty necessary. it is not necessary when there is an ultra sound machine there.    EDIT 2:   MOST dogs are impossible to X-Ray when fully conscious (unsedated) Do you know how hard it is to get a dof to lie perfectly still long enough to get an x-ray? i do!!     so this means someone has to stand in and hold the dog down. Even with a lead apron and gloves; it's dangerous and stupid. Most decent surgeries just wouldn't do it. It's detrimental to health in the long term|`|XaAzPXn8aa	X rays tell you more.  They are more accurate, as far as how many pups there are, since it's a picture...nothing is moving inside, which makes it easier to count.  Another reason  x ray is more accurate in counting how many pups there are, is because it shows the bones of the pups.  And they count the skulls, because, obviously, it's the most distinctive shape in the x ray.|`|KxjUim7yaa	X-ray gives a more clear picture|`|FewhKlx9aa	I had one litter of pups but my girl was x-rayed to see the spines.I think because they can do it right away rather than set up an appt.for the ultrasound.But either way they both show the pups..Mine showed 3 babies but my girl had 4 and I kept them all
uBFhKXgHaa	Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot. <br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the dog food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/</a> (RawFed)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawlearning.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawlearning.com/</a> (Jane Anderson's Raw Learning Site)<br>  <a href="http://rawfeddogs.net/" rel="nofollow">http://rawfeddogs.net/</a> (Raw Fed Dogs)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawmeatybones.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawmeatybones.com/</a> (Raw Meaty Bones)<br>  <a href="http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html" rel="nofollow">http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html</a> (Raw Prey Model Diet Vs.

VGLauPEkaa	It's not really known. The Chinese Shar-Pei is one of the older breeds that has been around for centuries.<br>  <br>  I can however tell you that all the Chinese Shar-Pei in the United States are descendants of four foundation dogs that were brought over from China in the early 19th century. It's sad, really. That's why there are so many problems with them. Not only were they all inbred heavily in the beginning, but that blood pool was narrowed down even more by people breeding for severely baggy skin and wrinkles, instead of trying to breed with the furthest dog related to it.|`|qwTQTFgvaa	It appears the Shar Pei may share some common ancestry with the Mastiff — due to his large head, heavy folding and stocky frame — and the peasant class Chow Chow dog of southern China. However, few stud books were kept and the true origins of the Shar Pei remain shrouded in the mysteries of the Orient. The name Shar Pei literally translates as “sandy dog”.|`|h6t4aRUOaa	Tosa Inu (Chinese Mastiff), Akita, Chow Chow|`|WIFKeDBgaa	After training a gazillion of each...I'd have to say they are directly related to Chows. Generalizing as a breed, they have the EXACT same temperament. And the clincher...Have you ever seen a shaved chow???? It's a shar pei. No $hit. I actually consider them a long haired & short haired version of the same breed.
N2jvxYPcaa	A breed association such as "The Grade Horse" association is of no use to me or many other people. But if you have a horse that could legimately be registered into a true registry, this can have a number of advantages.  1) Can increase your horse's resale value.  2) Makes your horse more useful as a broodmare as you can raise registered foals out of her.  3) Is proof to potential buyers of your horse's actual age and your horse's actual breeding.  4) The pedigree will give you and potential buyers the ability to determine if the horse will likely be good at certain jobs. An AQHA horse with cutting horse breeding is much more likely to end up being a good cutting horse than a horse from race horse or show breeding.  5) You will be able to enter breed shows and earn permanent points and show records, or else race records, under most breeds. This may not be of value to you, but could to a future owner of your horse.  A good looking, well broke and pleasant horse is of value even if it isn't registered. But a good looking, well broke, pleasant REGISTERED horse is worth even more. I would invest the money to register mine if the costs weren't too high (the normally raise as the horse gets older) and if your horse is eligable.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	Some registries aren't worth the paper the registration papers are printed on (Grade Registery for one).  However, if you have a horse of Color (Buckskin, Palomino, Pinto) do have breed shows and have been around for a long time.    IF you have a foal that you've bred and are raising that is elgible for say AQHA, APHA, AHBA etc, this increases the horse's value and have a lienage, each association has it's own shows and benefits to the horse belonging to that association.|`|4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	Registrations are equated to value.    Let's say one has a stallion or mare they intend to breed to make money.  The value of that horse could be in many things - if you're going to breed to sell for the purpose of showing, you want the best chances of buying a winner - a stallion or mares show record is kept by the breed association from competing in shows specific to that breed.  For example, a stallion with a ROM (Register of Merit) in Western Pleasure is likely to throw offspring that may excel in that type of competition if the breeder selectively breeds properly for that purpose.  If the horse is a gelding, the breed association has record of it's prior performances which can be used as proof of the horse's ability.  If I go buy a 'grade' (unregistered) horse, I have nothing more than the sellers words of what I may have seen with my own eyes in terms of the horse's ability.  But if the horse is registered, has been shown successfully in breed competitions, there's a factual record of it's success - the owner doesn't have to prove anything, the record is there for anyone to see.    So unless you're wanting to show at breed-sanctioned shows or you intend to breed the horse for the purpose of making money for a particular discipline, the registartion is of little value.    The only other benefit to registration is proof of ownership.  When you register a horse, photos are supplied and you are the recorded owner of that horse.  If the horse is taken, you have the papers and photos that could help prove ownership of that horse.  The registry notes any unique markings or brands or tattoos, etc. that would help identify the horse.    The type of breed also should be considered - for example, if you have a 100% 'thoroughbred' Morgan, for example, you could compete in shows where only registered Morgans compete - you would be judged on very narrow rules by a judge or a panel of judges that's focused on the Morgan breed and what they're used for - as opposed to showing at an 'open' show where there are all breeds and one judge who must know and understand many different breeds.  I've seen instances where a stock-horse judge is used at an open show, a horse such as a Tenessee Walker is shown an the Walker doesn't excel because he's the only one - the judge is judging one walker against many stock horses and perhaps doesn't know the standards of the Walker thereby enabling the judge to judge the horse against it's own breed standards - make sense?    Now, I had a Morgan gelding that only could be registered as a "Part Bred" which really is a lower grade registry in my opinion than a true Morgan - because of the reasons I've shown above - but still better than grade because he could be proven to be owned by me.    Careful of 'breed' associations vs. 'color' associations - For example, the "Palomino" is a breed in Europe, but a color in the US.      I have a quarter horse filly that is registered 3 ways - Breed registered thru AQHA, and color registered with 2 Buckskin color registries.  Why? you might ask?  Because not only could she someday compete in AQHA breed shows, she also can compete in color registry shows such as the Buckskin Association and perhaps gain extra points as well as a successful record on a wider range of competition - further proof of more success than simply AQHA or just Buckskin.    The value of any registration is in the purpose of the animal or transaction.|`|AA11570905	If you are a breeder you can register your animal and be able to produce a pedigree on his/her offspring.  If you show your horse for points in the breed association shows then you will need to have registration papers.  If you wish to have an official piece of paper to show you own such and such horse with such and such name and pedigree.  If you wish to support the promotion of your chosen breed.    There is no purpose to registering a horse that will be just a pet, trail horse or pasture ornament.  I own a registered quarter horse gelding...big deal, I can't breed him and I don't wish to show him.  All the papers do is show his number and my name as his current owner.  I can look up his pedigree which doesn't matter one bit on a gelding.    There are tons of made up breed associations out there that just collect your money and send you an official looking document that says your horse is registered with the "Half Quarter Horse" Association or the "Grade Horse" Association.  They just want your money and are basically worthless.|`|ec1d80b5105e09c381fb6e0b627016c2aa	One HUGE advantage that most people wouldn't think of is proof of ownership.  Registries have certain steps you have to go through to change ownership and it's documentation that you actually own said horse.  I recently lost a grade horse because the person I free leased him to said he was 'theirs now' and wouldn't let me have him back.  The courts never made a ruling so my grade horse ended up getting stuck with people who turned out to be dishonest and cruel.  I still have nightmares about him a year later.  We immediately since this incident had our two other grade horses micro-chipped by our vet and registered them into the micro-chip database as rightful owner.  We feel our registered horses will be safe from this so long as we always keep their original breed registry papers.  Other than that the other answers are true as far as being able to do breed shows, get breeding advice, make more money from your horse or it's offspring and also better for insurance purposes if your horse turns out to be talented enough to render or need insuring.|`|RloOJ43haa	I think paintgirl summarized things very well.|`|pR4JVtSJaa	Some breed associations offer benefits like entry at certain shows, breed/pedigree research, insurance discounts, year-end awards, and so on.  Some discipline-based organizations (such as the International Side Saddle Organization) arrange for special year-end awards for registered breed horses (ie - "Top Sidesaddle QH").  Registration also gives you access to a community of trainers, riders, and owners who share your love of the breed, and can share breed-specific help.
9tTeiZBXaa	Ball Pythons occasionally become constipated and will not pass a bowel movement and you have to be careful cause it can be dangerous.

rmxqoXrkaa	Depends, did you care for the animals like a pet? Or did you treat the animals  like they would be treated in the wild? Cause if you treated them like a pet, the poor things wouldn't know what to do. They probably wouldn't know how to survive. But if they were treated like they would in the wild then they will be perfectly fine.|`|oZWIdf3Baa	no no no no no you can not set domestic ducks loose on a pond or rather you should not at all because most domestic ducks can not fly and they would freeze during the winter and think of it as if it was a dog would you leave it in a park nope didn't think so|`|bYPfFCr4aa	yh it is ligle|`|x5HMQgQyaa	You might want to contact the local bylaw office - in my opinion, that constitutes animal abuse.

Apparently cats like warmth and the hotter the better.  Also they like to bundle up with a comforting pal.  People tell me I should make a warm soft place (something off the floor) for him on my dresser in the bedroom (wants to be close to me), put a hot water bottle in it, and a couple of cat biscuits (at first) and everytime he comes on the bed, to put him in it.

lFqUMMAGaa	Cat need meat in their diet ~ it would not hurt to give your cat the vegetarian treats as long as he has meat as the main part of his diet ~|`|AA11457471	Most fruit & veggies won't hurt your cat HOWEVER, grapes are one of the few that can. Grapes & raisins can cause kidney issues.  Most of us know chocolate is bad for our animals but that's not the only food that can cause serious problems. Onions, avocados, store bought cow's milk, a diet that's predominantly liver or tuna....  Be sure your cat gets plenty of meat as that is what they NEED to survive. The other stuff should only be an occasional treat.  Your kitty might enjoy having cat grass (wheat grass) to munch on. I try to keep a container around for mine. I get it at the produce store but a lot of health food stores carry it, too. Cats often munch grass when they're outside. It aids in digestion.|`|jI85GYGoaa	Sounds as if you have just got a bolshy cat.

I would say that your cat is sensibly waiting for a better quality food ;)  good luck :)|`|AA12084722	Just a fussy cat. Fresh meat will always taste better than cat food..not that I've tried. Cats are naturally carnivores and not suited to a veggie diet.|`|n7bok7NRaa	Cats can eat veggies and many cats are fond of them. Avoid giving him fruits, as cats do not tolerate sugary things well (it can lead to diabetes). Feel free to let him eat greens if he wishes. This will not harm him in the least, and may help his digestion.    Since he has a preference for certain meats, I would recommend trying out different types of wet foods until you find one that he likes. It may be he really isn't fond of dry food (you should give him some anyways mixed with the wet food to keep his teeth healthy).    This is important, though: Your cat MUST eat meat (or catfood with meat in it) of some sort or he may go blind. Even if that's chicken skins and ham. |`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	cats should not have grapes, or onions, or garlic. they need meat, they need taurine or they will go blind.|`|UXGDKkHxaa	Cats certainly should eat meat as part of their primary diet. However, one of my cats does like too eat Lettuce and sweetcorn, so maybe they do like too eat some vegetables.

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	Cats are highly intelligent and have a very developped sense of smell. Yours knows that the fridge is where there is interesting food stored and even though there may be no meat there, there may be cream, cheese, butter, fish or other products that it can smell and is interested in. My cat knows where the cupboard where I store her box of pouches is, and although she cannot smell the contents since they are sealed, she goes and opens the door when she is hungry.

BpKECFBSaa	Pampering your dog isn't all about clothes, jewelry, and material objects. Its more about giving your dog lots of love. Now if you do want the material objects, you just basically have to buy it a lot of clothes, beds, collars, fancy stuff, no dog food- Im pretty sure a lot of celebritys have chefs for their dogs- Look up recipes for some 'raw' dog food diets. Find a doggy spa or doggy day-care and take her to it every once in a while! Make her be the princess. <br>  Im not sure why you want this, but since you do, I hope this helped. <br>  Just give her a lot of love!|`|JRqzkUxUaa	The BEST way to pamper a dog is to provide it with high quality dog food, access to fresh water, regular vet care, a warm place to sleep at night, daily exercise, a safe and healthy enviornment and lots of love. :)<br>  <br>  When all of these needs are met, THEN you can buy it a cute coat for warmth.|`|2VXNq9Csaa	i love paris hiltons dogs!!!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlqt1rjgbd0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlqt1rjgb...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ok buy lots of things for her, clothes,toys ETC and get her groomed and always make a huge fuss over her<br>  <br>  for the stuff i recogmend<br>  www.doggievogue.com|`|PM23RDycaa	Pampering and spoiling your dog will lead to it being a pain in the ankles.

That is most likely because she killed the others from dragging them around. They need to be somewhere where they can poop & pee when they have to. Also they need a constant intake of high calorie food....or a supplement  like Nutri Cal.  Their blood sugar goes down and they can die.  I can't see that she could have been taking proper care of any of them...They cannot tolerate  being handled  all the time as she was doing....not at that young age.   <br>  <br>  I used to breed them,. and gave written instructions....not too much handling...and be sure their food & water is available to them at all times.   <br>  <br>  You don't see people dragging their newborns around do you?  No, because it is not good for them   Chihuahua puppies such  as she drug around...cannot tolerate that  treatment.   I will guarantee you they are all   dead.

ZxGAKWHQaa	I believe that that was a purebred Cairn.

She was in 13 movies, including Bright  Eyes with Shirley Temple. She was 5 or 6 when she appeared in the Wizard of Oz and lived about 4-5 years after that. (She died around 1944).|`|ncpgez55aa	i think so<br>  i have a cain terrier mix,there very protective.i dont think she was bred|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Geeeeze,sure hope it never reproduced;even that long ago it was SUB-STANDARD!
QnJvJ67uaa	Just because you can put weight on her back doesn't mean she has no back problem......The fact that she is happy in all other respects of you handling her would imply that there is a problem with being ridden, this could easily be teeth (checked at least one a year by vet or dentist) or back (chiropractor once a year as part of health MOT). A horse can put their back out easily in the field by slipping or kicking out.<br>  Because she is a pony she may seem fine to be ridden, some horses will put up with a lot of pain when ridden before they do something obvious to show their feelings.<br>  Get her teeth and back checked ASAP and get her saddle checked. If you don't sort this out soon you could end up with all sorts of catching and ridding problems as the pain gets worse.<br>  Good luck :) x|`|8cikAYp3aa	what it sounds like is.  you have a naughty pony who has learned to evade work by being a butt.     whats going to have to happen to cure her of this little problem is work on your part.   <br>  <br>  Don't give her a treat for turning her back to you in the stall.  Your reinforcing bad behavior every time you do.  When you come to the stall, she should come to the front and stay there.  <br>  If possible do Not tack up in her stall.  Find a pair of cross ties.  Or make a pair out of two long lead ropes and sturdy barn pillars. they make grooming and tacking up so much easier.<br>  <br>  Gently set her saddle down.  make sure the irons dont bang against her.  make sure to set the saddle high on her withers and slide it Back to where it belongs- that keeps her hair smooth and not being pulled.<br>  tighten the girth just enough to keep the saddle from slipping if she moves around, then do something else.  Clean her feet, brush her mane,  then come back to the girth.   Make sure your not doing it to tight.  elastic girths are difficult to guage because they do stretch and that makes then easy to over tighten.  Do a final check of the girth after you've mounted as well. <br>  <br>  As for  her bridle.  dose she give you a hard time with the halter? or is it just the bridle?   think about it. If it is just the bridle then besides making sure her teeth are good,which you've done.  Make sure you have the bit correctly set, it has no burrs or pinch points and is wide enough for her and isn't  to high or to low in her mouth.   A trick for really bridle shy horses is to unbuckle the cheek strap.  slide the bit in then bring the strap over her head and buckle it.|`|WdV6is3vaa	I think the above answers are all good suggestions but the biggest problem I see with horse people is them letting their horses get one up on them.  If your not top horse in the pasture then your not going to get them to do what you want them to do.  She might be showing she doesn't want to work.  Make sure the equipment fits right and follow the above answers but also be patient and assertive when working with her.  Good lord knows I do with my four year old untrained paint.|`|zzvDybEiaa	As the Horse Whisperer said, put your back to the horse, and it will come to you.<br>  Read the book or watch the movie.|`|djeTYZtoaa	the saddle might not fit properly or you could be pinching her when you do up the girth. before you ride tou should stretch her front legs out to stop the girth from pinching|`|OjeL1if4aa	Ok first of all... I don't know if I miss understand or not but you should be putting the saddle on FIRST and the bridle on LAST... not the other way around... if the horse puts her head down or steps on the reins you could have serious issues!<br>  <br>  As with the bridle... get her teeth checked out... she might have an abscess tooth or just need to be floated to ease some discomfort. Just because she isn't showing signs anywhere else doesn't mean there isn't a problem.<br>  <br>  With the saddle... I'd get it checked out to be sure the tree is sound and that the saddle fits her properly... it may be pinching her withers or shoulders and making girthing uncomfortable. Also, don't tighten it all at once... do so in small amounts... enough at first to keep the saddle on if she shakes or moves then walk her around and tighten some more... do that 3-4 times and check it before you get on. Most girthy horses are the way they are because people just slap the saddle on and cinch it down tight as possible... which usually pinches skin. <br>  <br>  I would also have a chiropractor check her out... they aren't that expensive usually... but it depends on your area. If she's out anywhere it could make both bitting and saddling uncomfortable. We had a gelding who was out near his poll which made it hurt to put a bit in his mouth... got that fixed and he didn't have an issue anymore.|`|dAl2E1Loaa	With her bridle, I would make sure her teeth are up to date. If they are sharp and she needs a dentist visit, having a bit in her mouth could be hurting her. <br>  <br>  Get her saddle fitted properly as well. I can seriously not stress how important a well fitting saddle can be for your horse, if it is pinching her wither or pressing on her back in the wrong areas it will hurt her, and can damage her back long term. There is obviously something bothering her with the saddle if she is throwing her head up and putting her ears back, so I would get it checked out!
Vl2Z390Eaa	its probably not likely they are too old. try putting more nest choices in as they can get sick of the same nest. put in like 3 more and they might choose one.

bDPVRtCNaa	I do not know whether or not oak is safe for aquariums, but I do know that rotting wood found outside may harbor harmful bacteria and parasites. Also, once in the tank it will rot.    You'd be much safer to use mopani driftwood found at both Petsmart or Petco, and many other local fish stores. Mopani is safe for aquariums, but if bought dry, will need to be cured. Curing directions- http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/articl...    Be aware that no driftwood is completely inert and will continue to leak tannins into your water. Letting the wood soak, and boiling it will leach much of the tannins out, but the wood may stain your water a slight tea color, and lower your pH.|`|37TowRL7aa	soak it in bleach and clean water.   then it will be fine =D|`|WhSRZJjYaa	YOU SHOULD PROBABLY CONSULT THAT WITH UR VET.....THE FISH MIGHT B ALLERGIC TO IT OR SOMETHING...AND JUST BECAUSE U DON'T SEE ANYTHING ON IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE ARE NO PARASITES ON IT....I HAD A TWO TURTLES AND I KEPT THEM IN AN AQUARIUM...ONE TIME I WAS CLEANING IT AND MY SILLY BUTT CLEANED IT WITH CLOROX....AFTER I WAS DONE I PUT THE TURTLES IN THE AQUARIUM...WHEN I CAME BACK THEY WERE FLOATING -CRY..I DIDN'T MEAN TO- YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO TO THE PET SHOP AND CHECK OUT THE ACCESSORIES THAT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO PUT IN YOUR TANK........ IF U ARE IN LOVE WITH THE PIECE OF WOOD U FOUND HAVE IT INSPECTED BY UR VET.|`|SY0cSoQuaa	I don't recommend it if it's rotting. You don't want to create an additional source of waste in your aquarium.    Driftwood is exactly that. Wood that has been drifting in water and now is rid of all it's tannins. All that's left is to boil it to destroy any bacteria. Try next to a lake or a river.

Both Daisy and her mother before her were the greatest dogs I have ever had.  Any dog can be dangerous, but the reason you hear about pit bulls more often is simply because of their jaw power.  So when they do bite, it causes more severe damage and makes the news.  Also, because of that jaw and muscle power, people take advantage of them to use for fighting.  They didn't ask for that.  I also have a chihuahua.  They are known to bite more than most other breeds.  You will never hear about because their mouth isn't big enough to do real damage and therefore isn't newsworthy.  <br>  It is best to raise a pit from a puppy because you can be sure that no one before you tried to train it to be vicious.  That could be a problem.  You go adopt an adult not knowing its history.  Just something to consider.  Although our first pitbull was an adult and we didn't know her history, and she was awesome.  I see how they were considered a "nanny" dog.  She (and her two generations that followed) were/are so protective over our children.  They were also protective of me and husband as well, but if we had to spank our children (on rare occasion), we had to put the dog in another room.  It seemed she understood to first protect those who cannot protect themselves.  Not that we were attacking our children, but just seeing us attempt to spank them would agitate her and she saw it as a threat.  She would never try to harm us in order to protect the children, but she would get in the middle and jump on us to push us away.  When my daughter was three, she would use the dog as a step stool.  She would lead the dog by her collar to the counter or shelf she wanted to reach and stand on the dog.  She never resisted, although she looked humiliated.<br>  My older children are in their early teens, and I still feel nervous leaving them home alone with their younger brother and sister.  I worry because of the stories you read about sex predators being in every neighborhood, around every corner.  But as long as I have my pit bull, I know that they are safe from intruders.  They are stronger and more effective than I could be against a dangerous person.|`|Wxr3mIRnaa	Actually,<br>  <br>  All dogs are great dogs, all breeds, all types, all mutts,... <br>  <br>  It's the owner who is to be blamed if the dog is wild or is out of control..<br>  <br>  It looks here as if you're an amazing owner :D wow, pit bull + bunny? hahha that's a very very awesome attitude... your pit bull is the most awesome i've ever hear lolz :D<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ncpgez55aa	some are fine,just pitbulls were raised fighters,but she is a girl,she sounds geat!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  www.dogbreedinfo.com/americanpitbull.h... -<br>  <br>  American Pit Bull Terrier, Pit Bulls, PitbullsAll about the American Pit Bull Terrier, info, pictures, breeders, rescues, care, temperament,|`|IdSqunZuaa	It really depends on its owner.

Make sure they have some sort of shelter, where they can go if they get scared.

The color "blue" in real APBT's is very rare to come by and is actually a fault...talk to any real Pit Bull breeder and they will tell you the exact same thing. If you want to do weight pulling get a real APBT, those blue bully mutts couldn't pull in a real competition if they wanted to, they tire way too fast and do not have the drive for it.<br>  <br>  If you get a pit that is UKC you can have it dual registered with ADBA also, which means you can enter into shows through any of those registries.<br>  <br>  ADD; ok well as long as you know, good luck on finding one I've been around this breed my whole life and i am yet to see a real blue Pit Bull.|`|PM23RDycaa	UKC is the only all breed registry(in the states) that allows APBTs and the ADBA was created for APBTs and Patterdale Terriers first and foremost and they have slowly started to accept other breeds. the KC in the UK and the Canadian KC accept them as well. Send in her registration papers for ADBA and then you can register her with the UKC as well  <br>  <br>  And at least you are looking for the REAL deal.

OTC drops won't work for allergy.|`|5uLDqE0maa	You probably could, but there's most likely a reason that he's uncomfortable. It would be best to have him seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible to see if he needs any treatment. Eye injuries left untreated can cause permanent damage. Your vet will be able to diagnose what is causing the discomfort and prescribe the proper medication.|`|Y5FyAekkaa	You can probably buy some type of eye drops at the  pet store or a farm store like Tractor Supply. If they are just saline then that would be perfectly safe to try to help your dog. Some human eye drops are pure saline too. The bottle will say.

fVcR6rpzaa	It sounds like you are giving attention to your dog, which is good. Play with him as much as he wants to if you have the time. If he would rather nap, that's okay.

Dogs just want to be close to us.|`|ktdpOM8Maa	There's not really a set amount of time he needs to be played with, especially since you're with him pretty consistently throughout the day, and he's getting plenty of walks.     Sounds to me like you should play as much as you like, and he'll be fine.     Also, side note, dogs tend to let you know if they're not getting enough attention by becoming destructive or acting up. He might destroy a favorite toy or one of your pillows, or even use the bathroom in the house to get attention. Not like I think you're not giving him enough attention, but that's a big warning sign, if you're ever in doubt.|`|OngBk4Ejaa	you should try different activities with him everyday  get him some toys and atleast try to play with your dog  for 30 minutes 3 times a day.
SnAsZapMaa	??Vaccinations:  Of course she can - just as you CAN throw a brick through your neighbour's window. But CAN and SHOULD are 2 very different things.  The only shot required past the boosters at 16 weeks old is for rabies. And if you are in a rabies area you should be using the triennial shot. See http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_G... for protocols and research.    ??Vet asking questions:  Very much so if she is a juvenile.  See http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_G... for information on the operations and the most recent research on possible side effects depending on the age at which neutering was done.    .??Charges:  There is a consultation fee, to which is added costs of materials. If your bit.ch is 2 months pregnant the only material needed to check that is eyes and fingers. However, if you choose to have an xray taken to make absolutely certain, or an ultra-sound scan, that will cost you extra. An ultra-sound scan is usually enough assurance, but the "view" is so small that a scan is not as accurate as an xray when it comes to counting pups. If you want either an xray or a scan in addition to the  vet palpating your bit.ch, get a quote beforehand.    ??"we were thinking that she could havE DONE SOMETHING":  No, you WEREN'T thinking.  Had you been actually thinking you would have taken her to your vet for a check-up as soon as you had cleaned her up. And while there you had a choice:  (1) Have her neutered then and there.  (2) Have her given the 3-injection series that prevents any fertilised embryo from implanting its placenta.  Either way would have ENSURED that she wasn't pregnant.    At this late stage, my recommendation is that you ask your vet how to euthanase her puppies, and then do so within a few hours of them being born. If you can't manage it yourself, have the vet euthanase them. If you are a big softie, leave just ONE pup for her to nurse.  See, obviously you have NO idea what genes her partner or partners donated. It is quite likely that some pups have Dog A as their sire, others have Dog B, and maybe some have Dog C as their sire! I'll bet that you have no idea what your own bit.ch's hip & elbow status is, or what other lurgies (e.g, epilepsy) are in her genes, let alone how her mates measure up. You can not predict ANYTHING about the pups!  Added to which, long-coats are not typical of the GSD breed so should not be bred from except in emergency-type situations. She is obviously not a quality bit.ch or you would have discussed the situation with her breeder when you first "were thinking that she could havE DONE SOMETHING".

Well to answer the shot question, a Vet will not give a rabies shot if the dog is pregnant. If she has had all her vaccines except rabies she will be fine, just make sure to get her in after the pups are weaned to have that rabies done. If she is 2 months pregnant, she is getting very close to having them. A Vet will do an ultrasound to see if there are pups in  there, and it can be pricey. Not quite sure what you mean about the Vet asking questions about her being pregnant though, sorry. Hope I have helped you! Good luck with her pups!!|`|JiCKFTuIaa	No, not a good idea to be giving shots to a pregnant b*tch.  That will actually reduce the antibodies she will give to the pups from her "first milk".|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Distemper/Parvo vaccine CANNOT be given to your dog while pregnant.  It is safe to give/get it the day after she has her pups but NOT until then!!  But Rabies vaccine is safe to give while dog is pregnant.  However most people would rather wait until after the pups are born.  That's what I'd do.|`|nYv65TlEaa	how old is your dog,parvo is done when puppies where I live    Rabi's is yearly    call your vet    and no it should not cost more,when you bring your Dog in for shots they should have an exam anyway,but you cannot get vaccines now till after the puppies are born,at least i waited and till the puppies were weened off of mom,call your vet,and ask if vaccination can be given when pregnant    Do not get an ultrasound,its a waste of money,x-ray at 55 day will let you know how many puppies,if ultrasound is suggested,I would get another vet,you know she is pregnant,and thats all the ultrasound will tell you..at 8 weeks start you girl on puppy food and keep her on it untill puppies are weened of mom|`|iuYtcX6Xaa	no do not get her shots until the puppies are weaned...and yes they will charge you for an xray (around $50 per xray) or an ultrasound (around$100)...if you know she is 2 months pregnant why would you want the vet to see if she is pregnant?|`|DqUi0xPhaa	I did not do shots during my dogs pregnancy (she was a stray)..some vets say ok some not..but with some of the vaccines being live I would not risk it.    The vet can normally only tell pregnancy and the number of pups through an ultrasound or x-ray..dog pregnancy is generally 63 days so they should be able to tell.    Yes they will charge...I paid 36.00 for the ultrasound.    How old is ur dog?  They should not have pups until they are at least 2...my dog was 1.5 and she was not the worlds best mother...I hope your dog is not under a year old..and no they would not ask questions abt the pregnancy...my vets could care less.|`|AA10457774	NO!

283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	female domestic cats can start going into heat as early as 4 months old. 6 months old is the norm though. Have your kitten spayed as soon as possible. Kittens weighing 3 pounds can be spayed regardless of their age, the sooner the better.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	About 5-6 months, sometimes earlier. You should get them spayed around that time.|`|IZhsP1kWaa	6 months & up usually,can be earlier or later.Every cat is different. Its best to get your kitten fixed at the age of 6 months.|`|lGG7KDmRaa	my kitten is 8 months old and in heat!!|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Between 4 & 6 months.  Get your cat spayed sooner rather than later.  Cats can go into heat again and again and again up until they are bred (get pregnant)!  So it'll be one heat cycle right after another, it could be never-ending.
AA10029366	Sled dogs were bred to be passed around. Siberians are typically very adaptable, and I'd expect this one to be no different. Nearly all of the Siberians I've had in rescue have adapted easily to my home/kennel environment after being raised elsewhere, and then adapt easily again to their new owner's home.    I would normally caution against introducing two dogs of the same sex, especially since the older dog will likely try to dominate the younger dog, who might not take kindly to it considering that it is HER house.    However, since your current dog is still a relatively young puppy, she is more likely to relinquish control to an adult out of "Puppy Self-Preservation Instinct". Be aware that you may have some spats to break up.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	This is why you need to introduce them before you decide on bringing her home.|`|OxFsslN8aa	As with any canines, it will be easier for them to get along if the humans in the house are the pack leaders.  If the two dogs need to decide who will lead, then fights could ensue or behavior that is not acceptable.  Are you the leader of your current pet?  Does she walk you?  Do you feel she has "issues"?  Work on the current dog before you bring in more.|`|CtYqMs5Paa	Yes it should be just fine.  Siberians are known for being outgoing and personable.  You should do a meeting between your dog and the potential adoption dog to be sure there aren't going to be any real issues...As a Siberian husky Rescue volunteer, I have had to turn down applicants once the current dog meets the rescue...but that is rare.  If the meeting goes well between the two dogs moving into your home will just be a new adventure for the new Sibe.  Good luck!|`|UwplbhSsaa	Absolutely YES!!!    I just fostered a 2 year old foster girl recently and she adapted just fine with me and is doing so again with her new furever home!    The important thing to keep in mind is that the first week will be the hardest. This is when they will be determining the pack order. Just be weary of food, toys, etc during this time. Have a couple of blankets/squirt bottles ready in case a fight were to ensue. This may not happen...I am just giving you worst case scenario.    If you are working with a responsible rescue they should give you any support you need during this time.     If you are planning on getting the dog from a shelter or directly from an owner, I would bring along your pup for an evaluation to make sure that they got along fine before you take the dog home.    All in all it can take anywhere from 3-6 months for the dog to become completely adjusted and feel at home. But it will happen. Just keep patient!  Good luck!!|`|elxZLQLQaa	yes it would be fine
rql2ZEJcaa	no.........  if ur dogs eye waters then it is usually because they got summat in it, especially if its a large eyed breed eg chihuahua|`|bIaywrBCaa	Yes they do! I have seen it myself with several dogs. I have seen mother dogs cry when their pups leave. I have seen one of my females have tears rolling down her cheeks and she wiped them away with her paws. Yes, they do cry. They can really feel emotion like we do.|`|vPde97E2aa	NO!|`|OngBk4Ejaa	yess.. they can but its not really like tears it kinda is but their eyes just get wet, and then whine and have that kinda sad look.|`|U1chPjvPaa	They have tears, but they are not crying. If your dog has excessive watering in her eyes, she may have  something in her eye.|`|pGacaRuFaa	I think elephants, and maybe apes, are the only other creatures besides humans that can cry. All mammals have tear ducts, but tear production stimulated by emotions is rare. Dogs only overproduce tears as a way of flushing out debris from the eyes.

Maybe they can check out the hole the dog made and get a search warrant to see what is in the hole. Good luck!

Kt0qVNZOaa	Give her some Tic Tacs... the one calorie breath mint.<br>  <br>  Joking. Don't!  I think Tic Tacs have aspartame and that can be toxic to a dog.<br>  <br>  It will just take a little while for it to come out.<br>  But you can try Tomato juice and white vinegar.|`|AA11457471	Yuck!<br>  See if she will eat fresh parsley. That's natures breath freshener & it's healthy, too.<br>  I strongly suspect though, it will just take time.|`|h7F4wA7eaa	If she got sprayed in the mouth by a skunk, get a toothbrush and some tomato juice and brush your dogs mouth with the tomaote juice like 3 times, than use some dog toothpaste and brush your dogs teeth again and it should be all good!<br>  Good luck!|`|a9566babe49bd6c6c2241df582840786aa	Feed her some tomato juice or puree.

That may give her diarrhea.<br>  <br>  Do NOT use human toothpaste on dogs, it's not good for them.|`|AXcCyoo8aa	Totally agree with the above comment, when my dog got sprayed NOTHING else worked but white vinegar diluted w a little water...we tried tomato juice, Dawn dish washing detergent, pretty much everything everyone else on here has mentioned and the ONLY thing that worked was the vinegar :)|`|Y5FyAekkaa	For smells on the fur, woolite is the best thing to bath them in.  However for his mouth I would try the old tomato juice trick. Also you could go to the pet store or ask your vet for an oral flush used for cleaning teeth.|`|3pEqG4ewaa	brush her teeth. or get treats for breath|`|xOI3xlXmaa	First, check her mouth and make sure there are no chemical burns: redness, swelling blisters.  Skunk spray is toxic and can literally burn skin, eyes,and yes, mouths.  Watch her the next few days, checking the tissue as well as making sure she can eat and drink ok. <br>         As to tomato juice?  Well, you probably won't smell the odor as strong but it doesn't actually neutralize the chemicals (called thiols) in skunk spray.  The best thing to do that is a mix of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda.  mix a a bottle (about a quart ) of hydrogen peroxide with 1/4 c. baking soda. Use a syringe, or if you don't have one, something like a turkey baster to flush out her mouth.  <br>        A couple of things: CAUTION: if she swallows the hydrogen peroxide it will make her throw up.  It won't make her sick or hurt her, but she will definitely puke.  Second, use the solution as soon you mix it.  It quits working if you store it.  Third: what to do with all that left over solution?  Use it on her skin to get rid of some more smell.  Just DO NOT get it in her eyes - it could blind her.|`|ZiQx93Qraa	vinegar...seriously white vinegar....nothing works better...mix it with a little water and wipe her face and as much as you can...My dog never got sprayed in the mouth..but has gotten sprayed so many times and vinegar is the ONLY thing that took the stench away. Just don't get it in her eyes. I buy it by the gallons.|`|0nos1iXlaa	I have to agree with the tomato juice.  For the rest of her.......I know this sounds weird, but Summer's Eve vinegar douche works wonders in a pinch.  <br>  To have on hand I keep a product called X-O Odor Neutralizer.  I get it from qvc.com<br>  Just mix it as directed on the bottle & keep a spray bottle of it handy.  Works on tons of other smells also, like pet accidents.  <br>  Good Luck!!!!!|`|EUGoxWXuaa	What did you do the first time?<br>  Get her to drink lots of water and if she is acting normal, she will be find.<br>  <br>  Curious..... what was she doing with the skunk?|`|77yg1Svcaa	this happened to my dog 2 times too and the smell got away by putting tomato juice on her she also drank it so her mouth didn't smell|`|mVM7DYPZaa	lol totmato juice|`|MXduE0Zlaa	try drinking tomato jucie|`|wdbVujuuaa	Put her in a kennel for a week and let them deal with it.

70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	I think those are beautiful pups!! How could anyone think they are ugly? Your pup will most likely be a very smart,sweet tempered dog,but will require a lot of exercise and grooming ( with that coat,get a FURminator!) As for what he will look like,it's hard to tell exactly,but it looks as though it may be heavier-boned,like a Golden,and may also have the Golden ears,but they could come up.He will probably weigh about 50-60 lbs,but he could be bigger or smaller.But I'm sure he'll be a lovely - looking dog.Good luck with your new pup!|`|OFpl236faa	I think this could be a cross with a lot of energy. I would really make sure to start training and have an idea of an exercise plan as the dog gets older. It's going to be smart and could learn naughty behaviors fast. We have Border Collies and know quite a few Goldens too. I bet that there is going to be a lot of hair, so be ready for lots of brushing!|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	There isn't a puppy in the world that's ugly.<br>  <br>  I think they'll be friendly, fun dogs to be with, quite active, need a job to do, love to learn, herd or retrieve or both.<br>  <br>  They appear to be built on the Retriever side (bigger feet) wider head but it's difficult to tell in a photo.<br>  <br>  Enjoy them!|`|7K8cKXOxaa	Seriously one of the cutest puppies ever! Both border collies and golden's are wonderful dogs so this dog will be wonderful!<br>  <br>  It is likely to be very energetic so it'll need lots of exercise. And both breeds are extremely loyal so he won't be lacking in that area! Borders are the smartest breed and goldens aren't too far behind so I'm sure it will be very intelligent and easy to train. Just make sure you give him lots of "jobs" to do and play with him a lot because if he gets bored then boredom can turn into destruction.|`|eDySIDPQaa	These pups are adorable and look to be large....<br>  <br>  they should be so  active, get your running shoes on for sure.<br>  <br>  Borders are easy to train and sometimes has a mind of their own, but most dogs do......they are intelligent, loyal and make great companions..<br>  <br>  Golden's are terrific dogs, the cross between the two is gonna make for a good trainable dog..<br>  <br>  hope you enjoy and have loads of years with them<br>  <br>  my congrats on researching the breeds first, most people will just go out and get the first cute puppy<br>  <br>  keep up the great work<br>  <br>  good luck|`|0nos1iXlaa	Both breeds are highly intelligent, affectionate, gentle & loyal family dogs.  They are also both beautiful dogs, so no I do not think it will be ugly when it matures.  I don't think the pictures of the pup are ugly.  It isn't doing anything but sitting there, but it's not ugly.<br>  I think you will be happy with your new pup & good for you for doing some research.|`|AszV7QWvaa	They will grow up to be adorable!  I have a border collie mix and he's sixteen years old and still going strong.  He is a spectacular family companion and he's been around all my life.

qMO9S6kvaa	try reading through these 2 sites.maybe they can help.
BpKECFBSaa	That is very traumatizing for a young puppy to witness something like that, but most of them bounce it off. Depending on the breed, your dog might have become aggressive because he is afraid that every dog is going to kill him! Well, to train him out of that, you need to introduce dogs to him. Ask a friend to bring a dog he has never met and take them to a neutral area- place where its neither dogs territory. Next, dont let the dogs interact, keep them on leash (about 2-3 feet). Gradually let them sniff each other. If you see any sign of aggression, lead him the other way. Do this until he gets to be better with other dogs! As for the peeing, crate or isolate him when other people come over. When they are settled, bring him out on a leash and dont let him really get near them for a minute. This is really common, and he will likely grow out of it. It sounds like hes a lab, because they do this quite often. Good job on neutering him and enrolling him in puppy classes. Any behaviors that you can't control now, you will then! Good Luck! Hope this helped! Email me with any questions!
iZcOz6E6aa	www.petfinder.org|`|PM23RDycaa	There are SEVERAL different toy breeds. You may want to narrow it down to a breed or two. No one is going to go and find a breeder website for every toy breed for you.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Uh...depends on the breeds? Just google.|`|qlECsz0Iaa	You first need to do some research on the many Toy breeds listed on the AKC website and then decide which one or two of these breeds is for you.<br>  <br>  Than it will be time to start finding a good breeder.  A good breeder will only breed one breed of dog, and shouldn't have any mixed or have dogs labeled like a breed "Malti-Poo" (maltese x poodle mix), they should also be very knowledgable of that breed and should have the pups parents on site to see.|`|BpKECFBSaa	I know you will probably get a lot of these answers, but you shouldn't buy from a backyard breeder. I would first check your shelter or go to petfinder.com and search for toy dogs (It will also be a lot cheaper for most places than buying). If you cant find anything, buy from a breeder, but I would get a background check, see the facility, get the papers, meet the parents (of the puppies of course), and ask TONS of questions. Some of them skimp on health checks and everything. Make sure to get vet records too! Just be really specific! Good luck with your future dog!

u1HahCoqaa	If she is registered you might be able to find it- or if she has a lip tattoo with a number on it, then she should be on the racing database as well.<br>  <br>  But if she has none of these there is nothing you can do to figure out her pedigree (That's what it is called, you know.), really, short of calling up her breeders and asking.
0B4plcLEaa	Chewing the nails normally is a good sign they are too long and uncomfortable and need to be trimmed. You can take your bird to your vet, petsmart, or do it yourself to get the nails cut. If you decide to trim your birds nails yourself for the first time...be very careful. The quick in a birds nail is very long and runs very far down the length of the nail, if you clip it on accident it will bleed. I keep a block of soap next to me when I do nails. If I clip one too short and it bleeds I scrape the bleeding nail across the soap and it stops the bleeding. You can also use flour, but with flour you have to keep checking and often repacking on the bleeding nail. Birds can bleed out quickly, so you want to make sure that you have somthing on hand to staunch a bleeding injury. I use small rounded cat nail clippers, and I snip a small piece off the end of each nail. A few days later, the quick will have receded further up the nail...if your birds nails were really long you can trim a little again. Make sure you have a bunch of sandy perches that help file down your IRN's nails...exspecially where she roosts at night. This will help keep the nail growth down. If you don't have the perches, their nails grow rapidly and you will end up trimming them every couple months. Peanuts are ok as a treat. Try whole grain waffles (my IRN loves them), whole grain toast, driad papaya, small pieces of cut apples or grapes.  The person who said use a humidifier to help with dry air is correct. The dryness in your house can make a birds skin very itchy, and they may start to pluck feathers. Keeping a humidifier on helps to keep your birds dust glands lubricated and working properly. This may help allievate the scratching. The chewing of your shirt is just a bird thing. They love to chew. Shirts with holes in them are common to bird owners! I just try to put on an already holey shirt when I pick up one of my crew.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	her skin may be too dry. baths help keep their skin in good condition. get a humidifier, and keep the room temp around 68 all year. they are tropicals and they need that environment. too many peanuts is bad. she is a bread junkie and that will have to stop. offer her kale, apple with no seeds, melons no seeds, broccoli....you can break her bad food habits with whole foods. don't forget the citrus fruits no seeds. try misting her with a water bottle some birds hate baths but love to be misted. you need to get her nails trimmed and have them show you how to do it yourself with special trimmers. find a specialty bird shop or an avian vet for this, if done wrong it can hurt her. also they may be able to help with some of her behavior issues as well. it will take some training and work but it all can be done. ring necks are great birds to have and work with.|`|OeQbs95Naa	i have one his name is tricky. Tricky use to have super sharp nails too. I get the stuff you put on the bottom of the cage i dont know what its called but its like sandy or something. I cut up some fruit and put it in a bowl on the paper that way he gets to eat his fave fruit, trim his nails and play with the bowl. Indian ring necks do get dry skin some times its mostly when they are moulding it should go away after a while.
FQyeGsIyaa	It's a chemical in the saliva (Fel d1) that triggers the allergic reaction.  It gets on the fur and skin when the cat grooms itself and then spreads everywhere when the cat sheds.  That's why even the nearly hairless Sphynx isn't allergy free.<br>  <br>  Some people say Rexs and Siberians tend to cause less of a problem.  You should try to spend time with them before you get one to see how you react.  This will give you an indication of which one is right for you.<br>  <br>  How severe are your allergies?  Mine are very bad.  I was adopted by a short haired cat and it's a shedding machine.  Despite all the vacuuming I do, I have to take 3 prescription drugs to control my allergies.  I've had the cat for 2 1/2 yrs and it hasn't gotten any better.  I've heard stories of people who get used to their cat and don't have problems after a few months.  I'm not one of them.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I added a link with tips about living with a cat when you have allergies.|`|TNTFomKeaa	If you have allergies, it's caused by something called dander which I understand comes when they shed their hair.<br>  My brother has quite severe allergies as he's asthmatic, and my parents keep three cats (he still lives at home). Two are shorthair, one is longhair and one is a kitten that bounces around everywhere.<br>  The cats are restricted to the kitchen and sitting room. They are not allowed on any carpteted areas of the house because the carpets can hold dander. Of course, they are especially not allowed in the bedrooms and are encouraged to spend the majority of the time outside in the summer. This is enough to manage his allergies at the moment, but when they were worse, we also used a product called PetalCleanse. You put it on your cat, all over (they don't like it because it makes them wet, but they get over it) and it stops them from producing dander or something. It works quite well and you only have to do it every month or two. My brother was fine when that was used and could even hold and pet the cats.<br>  I hope that helps. Good luck with your cat!|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Supposedly shorthair black cats have less allergen than others.|`|v6Ka4gwbaa	Hello,<br>  <br>   I personally think that short hairs are pretty good cats for allergen troubles. They are easier to comb, and they don't shed as much. I also have my cats groomed every so often to help, and for the most part, my allergies don't act up. It actually truly depends on the cats dander, rather then the hair itself. You're allergic to their dander, not fur. My vet tole me this. As long as you keep your cat healthy and take good care of their fur and skin, all should be well. Fish oil capsules from your vet that are FDA approved, help a lot with cats and dogs skin, and I just recently myself obtained some for my little guy.<br>  <br>   Best of luck, and congrats on getting a new addition. Cats are wonderful beautiful animals.|`|60Zcdr2uaa	I am one of those that has got used to the cats and now only suffer every now and again.<br>  I have 3 cats, 2 are short haired and 1 is a persian so has lots of hair!!<br>  Its horrible as I cant love them as  much as I would like but I still cuddle them. A few years ago I would get rashes and my face would swell up, I guess it was me touching my face that did that. I haven't had that for a while but Im very careful with how much fuss I do give them.Sometimes I start to sneeze. I then put the cat down and say `ahhhh Im gonna suffer soon if I dont put you down`<br>  <br>  Thing is even though the persian obviously has more fur, I think its the male shorthaired that causes the trouble. The other shorthaired female stays in the bedroom ( the other 2 sleep downstairs) with me at night and never causes me problems. I find that weird too!!|`|mmIFFX41aa	if ur allergic to a cat than its kinda a good thing ur getting 1 coz people who spend lots of time with animals dont get sick by them so if u get 1 it doesnt really matter which breed coz after a few months (or maybe weeks) u will just get used to it and it waont cause u any probs!
PGvxouUzaa	I think you mean "i have 2 dogs and 2 cats"lol well my dog licks her paw to and i had a cat so maybe they copy the cats or are just trying to be clean|`|vAnEp2pKaa	Well, I think they do it because they want to keep themselves clean..<br>  <br>  Shiba Inu<br>  The Shiba is a fastidious breed and feels the need to maintain themselves in a clean state. They can often be seen licking their paws and legs much like a cat. They generally go out of their way to keep their coats clean, and while walking will avoid stepping in puddles, mud and dirt.

AA11457471	It's called neutered, altered, desexed or, if all else fails, fixed.<br>  <br>  Prices vary a lot.

They often would rather pay the bill than have another stray to re-home.  They have all strays that go to them neutered anyway.|`|IuYekkPVaa	Vets cost in the UK vary, it all depends upon whereabout you live.  <br>  <br>  However, Cats Protection, the R.S.P.C.A. and many independent cat rescues offer free or low-cost neutering.

They are by nature odor free and this might be one of the reasons your parents bought you a hamster as a pet. But they manifest the passion for cleaning not only towards them but towards their home too. <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't be worried thinking that he is messy or that he urinates all over the cage. Many hamsters have special areas in which they sleep, eat and eliminate. I only hope my neighbor would be so clean . If you want to have a happy hamster you need to provide him healthy food and also to make sure that you take from the cage all the remains. You will be gratefully rewarded.|`|l8gUwy2daa	Here's what I found- Skin Diseases: hamsters can be infested with a number of mites, which can be identified by a skin scraping by a vet and treated accordingly. Ringworm (actually a fungal infection) can also occur, and requires treatment by a vet. Allergies and skin infections can also occur. Hair loss is not all that unusual and can be seasonal or happen in older hamsters. If there is flakiness or redness of the skin or any lesions on the skin, or the hamster appears to be itchy and scratching more than usual, a vet should be seen. Hamsters do have scent glands on their flanks which can be dark and sometimes alarm owners. These occur on both sides of the body and do not appear irritated or bother the hamster. Cedar bedding can also cause skin irritation or allergies in addition to lung problems so should be avoided.<br>  It could also be the bedding, the cage itself or something that you are cleaning the cage with. You best bet would be to take it to the vet. Yeah, it will cost you a little bit, but I'm sure that your pet is worth it. Hope I helped!|`|6JNswOpbaa	either take her to a vet she could have mites and when mine had it was too late and she passed away but mine did have other symtons dont buy shop killers for mites they do not work she need either an injection of some tablets in her water. <br>  <br>  Or she could just be itchy lol.|`|JxIKUC9baa	i suggest just take them to a vet don't stress just relax and and go to the vet. sometimes mites for them are just like head lice for us.
d517e237c5cdbdd38c8b5a471b607dc0aa	Is your wife wearing a new scent, taking medication, ill, or has anything else changed about her or your household? Your cat might be perceiving some change in her you haven't taken into account. Or there might be some other problem causing your cat discomfort. If she's not usually aggressive, maybe you should take her in to the vet for a checkup and point this out. Also, I assume you've gotten her spayed already, since she's two years old, but if not and if she's in heat every now and again, she could just be acting crazy. It's better for her health and behavior if she is spayed. <br>  <br>  Do NOT get her declawed. There's no reason to. A declawed cat may learn to bite instead, and then would you remove her teeth? It's just unfair to declaw a cat. <br>  <br>  If no other solution seems to work, maybe your wife can just take a little time off from being proactively affectionate with your cat and see if that lets things settle down. Also, your wife may be getting a little tense and worried around your cat right now, and that could make your cat anxious and uneasy as well.<br>  <br>  My cat was a little weird with my sister last year, and she'd never been scratchy with anyone in her life before then! I could see my sister's fear was making her even more tense, so I suggested she just not give my cat the chance to scratch, whatever that took. And after some cool relations and walk-away interaction for a while, they just seemed to both relax again and now my cat wants to be around her and doesn't scratch at all. <br>  <br>  I hope you find a solution that works for you!|`|RX4y2zkMaa	My wife had the same problem, it as basically my wife wanting to be friends too much and not letting the cat decide if it wants to be friends.<br>  <br>  Also the old tip of if it goes to strike you hand as you attempt to stroke dont move your hand or your get scratched as you drag you hand on the claws.<br>  <br>  Just take it easy and dont be too eager.<br>  <br>  Also let your wife do the feeding for a while.|`|Wxr3mIRnaa	Lol maybe your cat wants you for herself.. joking ahaha,...<br>  <br>  Cat's are really random animals unlike dogs, they attack, be kind, nasty , and cute, totally randomly...  So this is mainly wrong attitude or her hormones working against her.. <br>  <br>  Not a serious problem...<br>  <br>  Good Luck with your cat!!|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	because she can and she enjoys it<br>  <br>  cats are predatory animals by instinct and cannot be domesticated<br>  <br>  cats are not domesticated <br>  <br>  have her uterus removed and all of her claws as this will help
AA11457471	Nope, not a breed specific problem. Just like people, some care about being clean, some not.<br>  It's possible, too that she was taken from her mother before she had a chance to learn.<br>  <br>  I would suggest trying a higher quality food to see if that helps. You can also give her a dab of plain or vanilla yogurt several times a day to aid digestion.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Definitely not normal.  When was the last time she saw a vet?  I find it a bit odd that you spent all the money to buy a Bengal and yet are asking strangers on the internet about what may be a health issue.  Get this cat looked at - whether it's really a Bengal or not.|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	Yes she is just a lazy kitten.  Yes it's normal for this breed.  Cats stink.
5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	do some slow introductions. see how it goes. i would have to say get the intended environment scrubbed clean so there are no territorial issues. fresh start for both of them. i don't see why you can't try to house them together. if they fight separate them and just lavish both of them with loads of love and attention. You can never go wrong with that.|`|XDCLL4Oqaa	Yea, its okay. I had three boys (guinea pigs) from different litters.<br>  <br>  I have two dogs from different litters. <br>  <br>  I have two Birds from different litters and their different ages. <br>  <br>  All my animals come from different litters, your rats will be fine. <br>  <br>  Sorry about your rat.|`|l8gUwy2daa	I'm sorry to hear that one of your pets passed away. It is always hard to lose something that you love. It is a very good idea to get your mouse a new companion. Rodents are very social and even if you give her super extra attention, she will still be lonely and crave attention from her own kind. It will be ok if you get another mouse, but ensure that 1. They are the same sex, otherwise they will constantly reproduce. 2. Try to get one that is around the same age as the one that you have now. If you get one that is a lot younger than yours, she might actually try to kill it, if you get one that is a lot older, it might try to kill her, you know, the whole dominance thing. Besides that, you should be fine getting your mouse a new friend. Good luck!!!|`|JxIKUC9baa	yeah its fine you just got to watch them like all other animals to make sure that they actually like each other, but that's perfectly fine. have fun with your new mouse|`|Wxr3mIRnaa	It is perfectly fine... i have 15 mouse at home and they all come from different litters :D they're 1 big family now haha ;D<br>  <br>  GOod luck!|`|yT6JNMdIaa	Well, there is a lower chance of her being happily paired now than younger unrelated mice. But the chances are still high enough to try, go for it! =D
AA11457471	I'd say if that works well then give it that way. That little bit of cream is better than him not getting all of the med.<br>  You can also give it in a tiny bit of broth or tuna juice.<br>  <br>  Metacam has been used only for dogs for a long time. It only recently became a common practice to use it for cats.<br>  I don't know what took so long as it's very effective for long term use with minimal side effects.<br>  <br>  You sound like a wonderful "cat mom". <br>  Best wishes!
6KxBqnstaa	Keep her nice and warm by placing a heating pad under the outside bottom of her cage. Put food and water close to her. Put blanket or towel over cage halfway and check on her often. May be hurt, or may have something going on inside of her that is causing this. Vet first thing in am. Good luck.|`|Wx2Fl0xQaa	Is she on the bottom of the cage? Have you noticed a change in her droppings?<br>  Right now the best thing to do is keep her warm. <br>  Call or take her in to the avian vet in the morning as soon as they open.
AA11457471	Your kitten has a respiratory infection. If it's in his chest he needs to be seen by the vet ASAP. It can quickly progress into pneumonia. He probably needs a round of antibiotics.<br>  <br>  You can also run a cool air vaporizer/ humidifer in the area he spends the most time in. Don't use steam.<br>  <br>  Push liquids- chicken broth, tuna juice, canned food instead of dry. The liquids will help thin out the mucous.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	If you can please take her to a vet, if it's a respiratory infection it can easily spread to the kittens. If contagious at all they can get it too. It is best to get whatever it may be examined and treated by your vet. The longer you wait the harder it is to treat it, something I have learned first hand. Might want to have the vet examine the kittens and to also get a consult on the cat & kittens getting fixed. Our shelter is over run by cats and a lot of cats are being euthanized for no reason. Get well to the cat.|`|d517e237c5cdbdd38c8b5a471b607dc0aa	You have to go to the vet. Kittens can be very delicate, and cat's respiratory systems can be problematic. You want to catch and treat any infection as early as you can. Your cat probably has an infection that can be treated with oral antibiotics. And this is a good time to get used to bringing him to the vet anyway. Your cat will need veterinary checkups, vaccines, and dental care throughout his life. This is just one of your new responsibilities as a kitty mom. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and best wishes for a speedy recovery to your kitten. :)|`|ise05jjUaa	My honest answer as a professional answerer on YA, take him to the vet.  You don't want to take a chance with his health, he's still very young so what ever it is may make him worse faster then it would for an adult cat.|`|V1uWwwF7aa	Your cat may have a cold. You need to take it to the vet to get some medicine. My grandmother's kitten got a cold one time and she had to get medicine to put in its nose every so often.|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	V E T E R I N A R I A N|`|Hh9sRoZMaa	I suggest you should bring them to the vet. It can be that they are sick.|`|efQZOwEPaa	l Had a dog that had those exact Symptoms and it was a diabetes    pankryites problem producing to much insuline
iZcOz6E6aa	If he's going to the bathroom inside, he's not potty trained properly. ;)<br>  You should start back to basics. <br>  Contain him if you can't watch him. Crate, Xpen, babygated in a puppy-safe room. Keeping him on his leash helps too. He can't leave your sight that way and it's easier to whisk him outside if need be.<br>  Make sure all accidents are cleaned thoroughly with an enzyme cleaner, removing the smell removes the "GO POTTY HERE" marker.<br>  Take him out regularly (every hour to start at first) on a leash to a regular spot and praise like crazy when he goes outside. (No playing until potty is done. A keyword might help too. "Go potty" has always worked well.) It might help to bring some of his stool outside with you, place it where you want him to go. DO NOT scold or "rub his nose in it". If he starts going in the house make a sharp "AH AH!" or similar noise to distract him and get him outside. If he finishes outside, praise!<br>  I would also feed him on a schedule. 2-3 times a day. If you can regulate his food input, you can guess the output better. :D<br>  After all, he's still a baby who's growing and learning, hopefully he's not being left alone for more than 4 hours without a potty break... <br>  Good luck. It can take some dogs awhile to get the idea and stick to it.|`|Wxr3mIRnaa	Lol. <br>  <br>  What do you mean by potty trained? If he is potty trained he shouldn't do this.. this means he isn't potty trained, but i can tell you how to train him. <br>  <br>  1st off, i suggest you buy a chea[ rug or mat to place in your house, when you see ur puppy pee or poo anywhere quickly pick him up and put him on that mat... do this repeatedly... and he will soon go to pee and poo on that mat himself...<br>  <br>  I have 7 dogs, and i have 5 mats, they pee and poo on their mats each day.. and i trained them since puppies the way i said to you...<br>  <br>  Good Luck on potty training! :D|`|tKXUvdPOaa	if you don't feed him as much, that would be the case because he isn't probably putting any weight on because its just going through him and at such a young age too.<br>  <br>  Sorry if its no help.|`|7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	The term  Potty Trained,  means the dog is trained to go Potty outside. Your dog is not potty trained. He doesn't have  a clue.|`|9tTeiZBXaa	First of all what kind of dog do you have ?<br>  You may be over feeding your dog and that's why is pooping a lot but you have to be careful over feeding can shorten a dog's life. I would check up with the vet cause he can provided you with the best answer.|`|tbWPtZ76aa	take him outside when he wakes up after he eats after playtime and before he goes to sleep u could use training pads|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Quit feeding your dog human food, it can shorten their lifespan because some people-food can kill dogs.  Such as chocolate and grapes.  It isn't healthy for them anyways and they'll develop a horrible, and very annoying, begging habit.  It's annoying, and rude and embarrassing when company is over.<br>  <br>  Is it a small dog?  Are you giving it fiber pills?  A lot of smaller dogs are given fiber pills to help your dog's anal glands (when your dog drags their butt on the ground).  When really, too much fiber makes them poo uncontrollably.  My aunt, who's a vet for many years, told us to bring her to the groomers once a month, or every other month, and have them drain out her anal glands and take her off the fiber pills.<br>  Ever since, she hasn't pooped since.<br>  <br>  It could be she ate something that set off her stomach, this happened to my dog just a couple of weeks ago.  Try to cook him hamburger and rice, small amount, and feed him this only twice a day, for three days.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure he goes potty before you leave the house and before you go to bed.<br>  <br>  Since he's a puppy he'll have to go to the bathroom every 2 to 3 hours.  Let him out after eating, after napping, after playtime, and before you're going to leave/sleep.  Even though he's potty trained, his bladder isn't that of an olderdog and doesn't quite know how to old it as well just yet.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well that's all I can think of.  Hope that helped, good luck.|`|1NF6f4y7aa	he's still a poopy puppy helloooooo!!!!! ring ring!  a dog does not mature until he/she stops shizzing in yo hizzle.  get me?  give them two years.  he isn't trained yet and you know it... feed your dog popcorn to constipate him.
FfBll2n8aa	It sounds like your cat will be spending the majority of it's time alone. Personally, I'm someone who likes to keep my cat indoors all the time - but I know that's not something you'll do. The advantage of an indoor cat (other than the safety element) is that you inadvertently spend a lot more time with it, when it's around you inside all the time. I like to have my cat sleep in my room-it gives us extra time together, but so long as your cat has all the time between you getting home and going to bed, inside with you, I don't really see a problem. Cats are often accused of being aloof- I think some of that stems from them not receiving so much time and attention from their owners that dogs often do. The more time you spend with your cat, even when you aren't directly interacting with it, the better the companion it will be.<br>  All that aside, if you actually do stick to your plan, and don't lost interest, allowing the cat more and more time alone as you do other things, I think it'll be fine. As an indoor cat person, I like that you will be keeping your cat inside during the night - that saves the local wildlife and keeps your cat safer from traffic and "bored groups of people looking for something to torment".<br>  You sound like you are committed to doing the best for your cat, so good luck to you - oh, and MAKE SURE YOU NEUTER HIM!!! The world doesn't need more stray cats!! :)|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Yes keep him in the conservatory as long as it's warm. It is you cat and you can keep him indoor/outdoor if you wish to. Maybe a neighbor could cat sit him so he kept tabs on to prevent being run over by a car. That is the only thing I would worry about. Or keeping him in the conserv. full time or putting the hamster in a bedroom with the door shut & locked.|`|d517e237c5cdbdd38c8b5a471b607dc0aa	So basically, you're treating your cat like a stray that you're feeding? My advice is to give the cat to someone who wants it and will give it proper care. Don't blame not caring for your cat properly on living in England! <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you don't really have the time or means to properly care for a cat, and you're trying to make a smidgen of room for it somewhere in your life without disturbing things. You're more worried about your hamster? Just put your hamster in a room with a closed door! Or how about putting the hamster outside. Would you do that? It doesn't sound like it. It sounds like you're committed to caring for your hamster, but not committed to doing much at all for a cat.<br>  <br>  Seriously, you cannot shut a cat outdoors in winter, or leave him in an unheated room, especially with the door wide open to the elements. Cats freeze too. If you want to give your cat the happy, healthy life he deserves, please put him in the care of someone who will provide him with warmth and shelter. Even an indoor/outdoor cat needs to be able to come inside when he chooses or is compelled to by weather. Many indoor/outdoor cats choose to stay indoors in the winter. Forcing and locking yours out is simply mistreatment. Please, please give him to someone who will house and provide for him properly.<br>  <br>  And p.s. --- just because you claim every cat in England is an indoor/outdoor one, it doesn't mean you have to follow the crowd. The life expectancy for an indoor cat is about triple that of indoor/outdoor cats. I hope you care about that more than it sounds like you do from your "plan."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petplace.com/cats/life-expectancy-in-cats/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/cats/life-expect...</a><br>  <br>  Also, please read up on what a cat needs, because it doesn't seem like you really understand the care they require and deserve.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/cat_care/caring_for_your_cat_the_top_ten_essentials.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/cat_ca...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/484935-the-life-expectancy-of-cats" rel="nofollow">http://www.helium.com/items/484935-the-l...</a>|`|vOhVHoXeaa	Sounds OK|`|9cuwGC44aa	You sound better off getting a dog.|`|oIe3b65Naa	This arrangements might be ok during summer, but i would never do it during winter time. Maybe if there was heating in the conservatory.. But no, i′d keep him inside. I have 2 cats and they are indoor cats (Started off as outdoor but after the older one got beaten up quite badly few years ago, i decided to keep them inside at all times... <br>  I live in Iceland and i know it can get pretty cold over in England as well... <br>  <br>  Hope all works out great with you and your cat..<br>  <br>  Kristin|`|OuP5bF2aaa	I think the cat would be fine in the conservatorywith cushions to get cumfy on as some cats stay out all night in some households. Your daytime routine sounds fine but maybe it is worth looking into trying to let the cat stay inthe house even if it means shuting a door to your bedroom then he could curl up next to some heat incase we have another winter like this one where i don't think the cat would appriciateit. I nomy cat likes to sit on the floor where the watter pipes run underneath as it keeps her warm. Maybe worth trying to find a way as i no cats like being curled up. good luck and i hoope you have fun with the cat|`|Xdfc8RPraa	Are you getting him from a shelter ? If yes then he's probably used to being  inside at all times .I think you should watch him the first few days and see if he's scared to go outside,unhappy inside etc.<br>   Might be a bit cold for him in the conservatory especially when next winter comes..how about the catflap on the door itself ? It's not too expensive I think..<br>   And if you close the door to the bedroom at night your hamster should be fine :) You don't want him unhappy,so probably you'll have to compromise a bit,some cats prefer to be indoors most of the day or at night,depens I guess if he's a quite type or playful and outgoing :)<br>  <br>   Good luck anyway !
f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	She should be on pain relief medication for 5 days.  I am presuming she is.    If not then maybe she is crying because she is in pain.<br>  <br>  If it is not that, then perhaps she really doesn't like the collar.    I have always taken the collar off after 2 days.   There is not any real damage they can do after this time.<br>  <br>  What usually happens is that for the first 10 minutes she might try to pull at the stitches.     But as soon as she realises that it hurts to do this she will stop of her own accord and just ignore the stitches.<br>  <br>  Maybe even to temporarily take the collar off and give her lots of supervised cuddles for half an hour and then put the collar back on.   See if she stops crying when the collar is off.<br>  <br>  I hope your kitty will be okay, I know it's so upsetting when they are crying and you can't work out the reason why.|`|UZ9aNOxKaa	Well it could be of the e-collar it self(try using another collar) or its just that ur cat is just messed up after it got spayed.|`|9mdLmJHWaa	she doesnt want to get sprayed.|`|d04a9da07aef2d62921925435d094e19aa	cos you had her spayed|`|CT9AOpb4aa	be patient this will pass|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Why? Because she just had a surgery performed on her and is stuck with an annoying collar around her neck! I think you'd be pretty cranky too!<br>  <br>  I don't see why she'd need to be isolated to a single room. This is perfectly normal. She may be a bit sore still and I'm sure the collar is no picnic either.

ZxGAKWHQaa	Where is the crate when he is sleeping? I suggest crates next to your bed, so that the puppy can wake you up easily to be taken outside. How large is the crate? If the crate is any bigger than just enough for the puppy to enter, turn around and lie down, then the crate is too large... too large, and the puppy will be tempted to use one end to eliminate in and the other end to sleep, and won't try to wake you up. If the crate's by your bed and appropriately small and the puppy is not trying to wake you, I would set your alarm clock for four hours after you go to sleep, get up and take the puppy out, and go back to bed; after some days if the puppy is keeping the crate clean, begin setting your clock for four and a half hours after you go to sleep; then five... five and a half, etc. ... eventually, you and the puppy will be sleeping all night. (If you start with four hours and wake up to find the puppy has already pooped, you will need to try an even shorter period of time to start with).|`|9kTejB0uaa	Feed your puppy in his crate and I'm be willing to bet he stops this.  But do you go with him last thing - so you can be certain he's emptied?  He does need to go at least sometime during the evening, if not right before he goes to bed.  How many feeds is he on?  How old?  Food usually takes 4 hours to process through, so you might work out when he actually 'needs' to go, assuming he is fit (doing normal stools).|`|1Is7u1wUaa	How long are you leaving him in his crate for? Puppies can only hold it in for an hour per month of ages plus 1, so for example, if your dog was 3 months old he would be able to hold it in for 4 hours.  You need to get up in the night to take him out.  Is the crate too large? It should only be big enough for him to stand up and turn around in. If it is too big he will probably poo at one end and still be able to lie in the crate without getting dirty so he feels comforable doing this.  Is he ok being left alone or is he anxious? Separation anxiety can cause house training to go out the window when left alone, but is a separate problem to house training itself, it is due to him being stressed when left alone. I am very keen on crate training. If done properly you can house train a dog really quickly.<br>  <br>  Also, what time do you feed him in the evening? Try to feed him before 6pm and make sure he empties both his bowels and bladder before he goes to bed to avoid accidents. Hope this helps!|`|WdV6is3vaa	Usually if you crate train a puppy you want to get a crate that is big enough for them to lay down in but not big enough for them to turn around in.  If they can turn around in the crate then they will usually have accidents, but no animal likes to lay in their own waste so if they can't turn in their crate they'll hold it in as long as they can.  My suggestion to you is to set up the crate with boxes or something that will block the extra space until he grows into it.  Thats what I had to do with my Lab/Rot mix.|`|iZcOz6E6aa	Is the crate too big for him? It should only be big enough for the dog to stand up, turn around and lie down in. Any bigger and they've got room to potty and be away from it. If that's not the case, I've heard of puppymill pups having issue with this problem as they're used to going in their area from being forced to at the mills. <br>  How soon before "bedtime" is he fed or given water? Either too close to bedtime can really be cause for the problem.  Say 4 hours or so, if possible. Water maybe 3.<br>  Other wise, I would make _sure_ he goes before bedtime. Even if it takes awhile.. which can be frustrating too, but worth it. (Puppies tend to want to potty after playing, maybe that'll help get him in the mood. LOL Some playtime inside and then outside for potty. If you don't already, try to designate a potty area. Go right to it and just stand there until he goes potty. No playing until after.)|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Some people worry that crate confinement is cruel, but if you do it right, your dog won't see it that way at all. His crate can be a cozy den where he retreats from household chaos or just relaxes. And once he's housetrained, your dog will have the run of the house as well as a nice little den of his own--just leave the door open for him.<br>  here are some guidelines:<br>  <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=827116704413514019910544442552" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=827116704413...</a> <br>    <br>  hope this helps.|`|hK42uqLCaa	How old is your puppy?

Our neighbors went full blown distemper which causes them to go insane and then die. Parvo I dont know. Its so easy to get, really easy. The shots are not expensive. You might be able to get some at a feed store, as in hay feed type stores. I was able to cheaply buy one and admisister but one is a live virus shot and has to be given by a vet.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	You have loads of answers so l will not really add to them suffice to say the ONLY way to prevent both parvo and distemper is to inoculate and keep up boosters evey year.if buying a puppy you must make sure it has all its immunizations.To the person that stated that a dog can get parvo even when inoculated that is rubbish the only way that will happen is if you fail to give boosters every year.l should know l am a vet nurse And a fully qualified one to boot plus a longtime Breeder and have yet to come across a case of parvo in a dog that has its inoculations up to date.The only thing a dog can get although they are immunized against it is kennel cough a highly infectious air borne virus and even immunized dogs can get it but in a weaker form.|`|f89f116400d4ff9b53b246c33e1753cdaa	Parvo can kill dogs - it is like a very bad dog flu and diarrhoea - anything the dog eats comes straight back out the other end, hence the dog basically starves to death.<br>  <br>  Look it up on Wikipedia - it is not as common now so don't worry too much - but, you have no way of preventing it I'm afraid - even vaccinated dogs can get it (been there, done that) - only cure is rapid response and a trip to the vet for assistance and connection to drip feeding and intravenous antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Check it out here - <a href="http://www.future-of-vaccination.co.uk/canine-parvovirus-disease.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.future-of-vaccination.co.uk/c...</a>|`|D75rqaihaa	well you know the vaccinations your dog had as a pup, and the booster jabs he gets every year, there against parvo, so make sure you get them done, the symptoms will be your dog will be extremely sick, ive only known 1 dog to survive parvo which was a great dane puppy...if your dog is a puppy dont take it outside at all uintill its had the injections, parvo is usually caught through other dogs urine e.c.t so when a dog stands on it or licks it e.c.t it could catch it<br>  <br>  good luck|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  "Parvo" is a word most puppy owners learn, and learn to dread.

Symptoms include, listlessness, loss of appetite, stomach pain, vomiting (blood streaked), pale grey diarrhoea, dehydration. Parvovirus can be transmitted on clothes, shoes and utensils.<br>  <br>  The treatment is to ensure as a young puppy your puppy is not exposed as much as possible to other dogs until it is vaccinated and the vaccination has time to work.<br>  <br>  Distemper is a highly contagious disease that starts with a runny discharge from the nose and eyes, a cough and high temperature. The nervous system can also be affected and this leads to convulsions. It is usually the secondary infection, which is commonly pneumonia, that causes death. Hard Pad (hardening of feet pads and nose) commonly follows an episode of distemper. Distemper can and should be vaccinated against yearly.<br>  <br>  Again vaccination is the key here.

UEy1Ti1Aaa	He's going through puppy teething-leave his teeth alone for a week to allow them to come through - you are starting quite early and it sounds like you are being a bit over zeolous-would you want your teeth touched if you were teething-relax a little a chill out. Anything that is causing your puppy pain you should leave. Obviously if your puppy has problems with his teeth then you need to speak to your vet or dog groomer.|`|kyTgneGnaa	yes when dogs are growing new teeth they tend to chew on thing to ease the pain. his gum is going to be sensitive you can try to gently brush it|`|Re0ivDOiaa	i have a dog too i think it would be miserable if i brushed its teeth so i bye doggy bones that they chew on and it cleans his/her teeth.|`|NDHabjoUaa	i never brush my dogs teeth, cuz he eats raw natural food n his teeth are very healthy n white so there you go|`|eu6UQElYaa	Yeah, the brushing probably hurts his new teeth.  Instead give him a dental chew toy or a bone specifically made for cleaning teeth.  The way a dog's teeth are set up makes it unneccessary to actually "brush" their teeth with a toothbrush, instead dental chews and dental bones are just as effective as actually taking a toothbrush and brushing the dogs teeth.|`|9kTejB0uaa	12 weeks is just a bit young for his adult teeth to be coming through!?<br>  <br>  If you are hurting him with all this brushing, quit.  It's not necessary to be constantly at his mouth (brushing TWICE a day - crazy!) in any case and he's probably sick to the back teeth (pun intended) of having his mouth pulled around poor lad.<br>  <br>  It's your choice re the BARF diet of course, but I'd be seriously worried about how 'complete' his diet is on this food, for a 12 week puppy, and raw chicken necks - surely don't give much nourishment?  Quite apart from the risks involved in using any sort of chicken bone (and especially with a baby puppy).|`|cj29AORfaa	you should try Greenies. They have one for puppies.

They are a relatively healthy breed.<br>  <br>  "Some blood lines are prone to slipped stifle, dislocated patella (knee-cap), heart and skin problems, and eye infections.

(Our retriever is called Henry!) Something with a bit of weight behind it. Calling dogs "doggie" names (Rover, Bowser, Fluffy) works too, but somehow if you tell people you have a dog called Arthur or Harry, in their mind he is already a noble creature.

ZxGAKWHQaa	One puppy. You want to get one puppy, do a good job of raising it to adulthood, and only then get the second puppy. Two puppies are ten times more work than one, and they are less likely to get along as adults than dogs who don't relate to each other as siblings (if you get two babies at the same time, they will feel like littermates even if they aren't). I am puzzled by how it is you know you can effectively train a dog at home when you've never had a dog before. A good puppy class followed by a good beginner obedience class will be time well spent. Books are a good investment. Finding a reputable breeder who will be there for you with advice for the life of your dog is excellent.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S. The breed's friendly, tolerant attitude makes him a fabulous family pet, and his intelligence makes him a highly capable working dog.

You are speaking of two rather different breeds here,  Both are shedders, the Golden being the more obvious.  BUT they're among the sweetest breeds you can find.  I got my Chocolate Labrador on the 49th day of his life and 8 months later, I got my black *****.  Sidney adored Roxanne<br>  I bought a LARGE kennel for Sidney with a tray that slips out the front and with a substantial front door.  It will cost you about $150.00 +.  Bed the bottom comfortably and teach the dog that this is his/her bed.  Sidney knew it right away.  <br>  Don't wait too long before you get the other puppy (about a year).  I'll almost guarantee they'll be best buddies if you get the male first.  Girls tend to be territorial even at that tender age.<br>  Roxanne and Sidney slept together in the Kennel (squeezed) and my cat slept with them.  What a scream.<br>  I you don't know obedience training or haven't read what to do, take one then the other to obedience school!|`|VGLauPEkaa	If you get two puppies, the puppies will bond to each other more than to you, making training even that much more difficult as well as be more of a distraction than company.<br>  <br>  It's better just to get one dog the whole family can enjoy, train it and raise it the way you want it to be, and once that's steady, then introduce another puppy, that way the puppy will follow the older dog's lead, and hopefully learn to listen to you like "big brother" does.<br>  <br>  And yes, obedience classes are necessary. Even if you know how to train them, the socialization that classes give, even just puppy classes, is extremely useful and helps them become more comfortable in all situations.
AQsiugSpaa	Hi Tammy,<br>  <br>  While you are paying for your vet's car payments, I am paying mine to pave her driveway! Just a bit of humor before I dive into the question.<br>  <br>  It does sound to me that he possibly may have suffered brain damage when he was that itty bitty baby that you rescued from the car engine. He may be somewhat developmentally challenged or slow due to that trauma as an "infant" kit. Bless you for rescuing him.<br>  <br>  He has bonded to you as his "mom" of course, so you are the object of his affection and trust. He never had the opportunity to go through the developmental stages that are so necessary in his formative weeks, such as interacting with his litter mates and his mother. So he started life at a great disadvantage. His physical development is that of a 6-8 week old kitten, so that tells you where he may be emotionally as well. He just doesn't know how to interact with your other cats. It is a weird thing for him. Often orphaned kittens lack certain developmental growth. Additionally your baby kit was rescued from an engine block. Gas fumes and other chemicals may have affected him, when comparing him to your other rescue orphan.<br>  <br>  To test hearing, snap your fingers behind his ears when he is not looking at you. He should turn his head. Since he is not reacting to loud noises, his hearing may definitely be impaired. Kittens usually jump to the ceiling when startled. ( a slight exageration).<br>  <br>  As far as his food choice is concerned, obviously his taste buds are not affected. I have a nine year-old Oriental who will basically only eat Wellness Kitten food. He turns his nose up to anything else, and thankfully my vet tells me that since he is of a perfect weight and size, this is not a nutrtional problem for him. Otherwise he would starve himself to death. He will eat baby food, but that is not a proper diet for a kitty as a mainstay.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would ask your vet to do some neurological testing and to check his eyesight and hearing as well. If he cannot do this, a visit to an eye specialist would be a good idea. But from what you describe he has vision as he responds to you on sight. However this being said, he may be responding through his sense of smell. Cats as you know have incredible scent capabilities.<br>  <br>  With his apparent developmental stages appearing to be affected, he may well not have the comprehension skills and he seems to have a short attention span from your description, so that may be another symptom of some kind of brain damage.<br>  <br>  I am not a vet, of course, and I am just postulating some ideas of what may be going on with your kitten. He may develop more skills as he gets older, but if it were my kitten, I sure would want to get a complete neurological assessment, just to know what issues I am dealing with.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best with your kitten. He does sound like one that is super attached to you, as his mom, of course. You did not mention if he is using his litter box appropriately, so I assume this is not an issue. <br>  <br>  Just for your reference, I am including some links to the developmental stages of kittens, of course in "normal" circumstances, so you can compare where your kitten may be in comparison. The first one really addresses your situation really well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/kitten..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/kitten...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.boutiquekittens.com/Kitten-De..." rel="nofollow">http://www.boutiquekittens.com/Kitten-De...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestfriends.org/theanimals/pd..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bestfriends.org/theanimals/pd...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck with your baby.

He has no problems eating,though,and is very friendly to people and has never even attempted to bite or scratch,even when he had a broken leg. He is also fearless and seems to have no sense of danger.I believe this is in part because of his deafness.I wonder if your cat might be the product of inbreeding? I saw a litter of kittens once who had been fathered by their own brother,and they were abnormally small.I guess you'll just have to get used to his little quirks! As long as he is physically OK,then I wouldn't fret about it too much.I'd love to see a picture of him.Here is my little oddball,Patterson:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n85/Luna810/PictureorVideo896.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n85/L...</a><br>  <br>  Edit: To test his hearing,clap your hands close to his ears while he is sleeping.If he doesn't startle or at least wake up,the he is likely deaf.The vacuum cleaner reaction makes me think he is deaf,too,as Patterson pays no attention to ours at all ,while my other cats scatter.|`|pO8KUAkBaa	Carmel sounds like a delightful cat.  I have many and some of them do just what yours does.  They only eat out of a certain side of a dual bowl, are frisky and friendly at times and at other times they are not.  I did not read anything that alarmed me about your cat.  Sounds like fun.  The others probably avoid him because he is new and still a little feral.  That is not unusual.  They will warm up (perhaps after a few fights).  Enjoy the kitten as a kitten and let him/her develop a personality. Riding a vacuum and not chasing things that are out of sight may be an indication of a hearing problem (it doesn't know where it landed because he did not hear it land).  The loud sound of a vacuum cleaner sends my cats slinking for cover.  Check its hearing|`|qzPZf2XPaa	Hmmm, you found him in the engine block?<br>  Maybe the lack of nutrition from his mother, the poison he received from the exhaust he was around, the fact e was near death when you found him an the bad genetic mix we can assume he is made up off have created a mentally handicapped cat.<br>  He needs love, which you are giving him but he might not change.<br>  And yes you should get his sense checked out.<br>  Maybe he isn't totally deaf or blind but a very god way close to being?<br>  Like 80% blind and deaf? His eyes do sound malformed....<br>  Sorry if I couldn't be more useful.|`|UC9Wjjscaa	I had a kitten once that I think was def. He was the same as you describe yours around loud noises that would normally scare a cat.  Mine would just lay there and you could run him over with vacuum if you didn't stop because he would not move.  He acted funny compared to our other cats but we just accepted his uniqueness and we enjoyed him alot.  We just had to be careful because he couldn't hear therefore he would not move if he didn't see something and would almost get stepped on and other things.  I would talk to the vet though.  My brother had a cat once that he had adopted.  As a kitten his head was slammed in a car door and he was never the same.  The old owners were gonna kill him so my brother took him in.  He was super weird.  He would be doing something and suddenly just freeze like he forgot what.  He would be in mid step with foot in air and just stop.  He would stay frozen for sometimes up to 30 minutes or more if you didn't go remind him that the was moving.  He probably would have stayed longer but that is the longest we ever let him stand like that before we went and nudged him or something to remind him that he was moving to go somewhere.  He was a super sweet loving cat just mentally not right from the head trauma he received.  The vets said there was nothing to do but love him and accept him the way he was.  They explained he was kinda like a mentally handicapped child and we just had to accomadate him the best we could.  As far as eating I think he is just a picky eater.  I have a perfectly normal cat in every way except he will only eat one kind of food.  He won't even eat tuna.  I give all my cats some every now and then for a treat and he turns his nose up.  I have never before him seen a cat that didn't like tuna. But he just prefers that one kind of food and its not even a real good brand (Alley Cat) But thats all he will eat so I feed it to him.  Any way good luck!
h6t4aRUOaa	That's going to be very hard as DL GR CH Tornado was only bred twice. Eli, Red Devil, Corvino and Boudreaux were mixed in to these two breedings so try a kennel that has those bloodlines and look into their pedigrees. Go to a five to seven generation pedigree as these breedings were in the late 80's early 90's. You know she made history in 91. My three boys are Wilder-Hemphill CH and it took me 3 years of research to find them. Good Luck. It's hard to find people preserving the true breed. Most want the muscle-bound, big-headed, blue freaks. You know there was cross breeding to get the blue .No true Old Family was ever blue. It was hard enough to find a black dog. Look at the old pit history books, not one blue.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD In some states where there is BSL, Pit bulls do not make it to a shelter. Thay are taken directly to a breed rescue or to a clinic to be destroyed. Unfortunately this being the result of BSL caused by ignorant and uneducated owners.|`|26PPwzrWaa	I cant help you, but given there are a few breeders in my contacts, I will star to see if they can.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	You know, there are some great pitbulls you can find at your local shelter. Which im sure would quickly adapt to the hog hunting life. <br>  <br>  Well thats odd that youve never seen a pit in your shelter, one of the most commonly dumped off dog breeds. Well how about you check around other local shelters and see what they have.
hKVOw1Sjaa	Depends what you mean by high maintenance.if you mean grooming then avoid all the longhairs as they require constant brushing to keep them tangle free.If you look for an indoor cat which is the best way of keeping one choose one like a Burmese or Siamese if you like cats with definite personalities but if  you do not like a cat that demands attention,will follow you round the house then for get these two breeds.Most people are quite happy adopting a kitten not long hair from a shelter or ASPCA,SPCA or whatever.it all depends on your budget.All cats deserve good diets but the majority of people open a can of cat food and put some dry food down and also water and that is all.Up to you if you wish to feed your cat properly or the lazy way so ultimately this is your decision.if you adopt a kitten or cat from a Shelter it will be desexed or should be and the cost will be small.A pure breed cat like the two l mentioned will cost you some money so that is again up to you.Depends if you want a lounge lizard or something as similar to a dog without having a canine companion.|`|PkC1Sk8Qaa	As a general rule, cats are pretty low maintenance. You put down food and water and thats mostly it. They will clean themselves and decide how they will fill in the rest of their day. When they want attention from you, they come to you and make it clear.<br>  <br>  Just be wary of a few things with getting a cat. Decide whether you want a cat with long hair who will shed a lot during summer and possibly upset allergies or whether you want a short hair cat that sheds less. Also decide about whether you want an inside or outside cat. If outside, you have to consider things about your property to keep it safe.|`|AA11589437	No, but you neeed to be ready to spend money when they have a medical emergency. My male cat has had a serious problem and we paid a lot for him to get well, but my female cat has never had anything, so we practically only pay for her food (she eats little, too) and her shots and flea medicine once a year.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	Burmese is the nicest breed in my opinion. They are very intelligent, like people's company very much, have short fur with little dander so they are not messy and not allergenic, and are very beautiful to look at.|`|kKgf6itqaa	Not unless you want them to be. My cat has never been high maintnence. She can be attached to me sometimes but otherwise shes perfict. My cats name is FLASH.|`|0Gyrecxxaa	Are cats high maintenance, well that depends on the degree of care they receive. Anytime you have one with an illness it's going to run $50 or more in vet bills and probably closer to $100. They need to be spayed or neutered...another $60 to $120. Cat food is cheap...cheap cat food is. I have six cats. I pay $35 for a 14lb bag of food. Cat litter is cheap....cheap cat litter is...see my point? The sky is the limit. It all depends on whether or not you demand the best for your cat. I spend WAY too much money on mine..or so I'm told, by people who would prefer that I spend my money on THEM instead.<br>    Heck, flea prevention alone is about $10 a month for a topical, and best practice is to use it all year round.<br>    Now add to that the possibility of scratched up furniture, wood moldings, doors, broken things shoved off of tables and such, and the holes you could potentially have in curtains, clothing, etc........<br>    It takes a special breed of people to love a cat. Yes, cats are high maintenance. But once you find yourself attached to one, forget it...you'd spend your last dime on that cat and give away everything you own for it....and never think twice about it just as long as you've still got that cat.<br>    If you want to have cats that are low maintenance, I suggest having photographs of cats or watch the Discovery Channel!!|`|a1HF7WNeaa	they are not really they take care of them self just needs shots flea meds and food water|`|AA12398420	It depends on how much you really CARE about your cat. If you love your cat and want what is best for it then it can be expensive.<br>  If you want to be cheap then get a stuffed animal. Cats are living, breathing animals that need good care for the rest of their lives and nowadays they can live up to 25 years. If you cannot commit to that then you should not get a pet. Consider fostering a cat from a local shelter.
Wxr3mIRnaa	HOLY CRAP! 15 POUNDS!?!?!<br>  <br>  That is way overweight my friend, the standard is about 8 pounds for a shih tzu, <br>  <br>  You have to cut your dog's food dramaticly to prevent a lawsuit or eventually your dog's early death..|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	your veterinarian should be telling you what she should weigh and what her diet should be. always go with what your vet suggests for her food and her weight. get a good quality dog food, make sure the chicken has no bones and you are good to go. Best wishes.|`|ZxGAKWHQaa	The package directions for most foods do not give a realistic guideline for how much to feed... usually, they suggest way more than is required. If you put your fingertips on your dog's ribcage and stroke lightly, you should feel ribs. If you do not, you need to reduce your dog's food.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Stay away from the vet for food suggestions. <br>  <br>  And just lower the amount you are feeding her if she seems fat. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com</a> to learn more about dog food.|`|kyTgneGnaa	your vet is the one to give you the proper advice but when my Labrador Nitro had some wait issues it began to affect his hips. so his vet told me to feed him less if i am feeding him twice a day only dog chow with the meat i cook for him.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Fat is not fit. As with people, overweight dogs are more prone to health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and painful joints. How can you tell if your dog's overweight?<br>  here are some guidelines:<br>  <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=530431606076307944111093097089" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=530431606076...</a> <br>    <br>  hope this helps.|`|YYlt6OR9aa	i think that you should try to feel her ribs. if you can feel them but not see them then she is okay. if you cant feel them or see them than she is overweight. if you can see then clearly then you should start feeding her more.
3uMgKZmNaa	Make sure they get light 14-16 hours a day.  That will help them to keep laying.  I use a 40 watt bulb  in my coop and that does the trick.|`|2rXWZkbnaa	Its winter! Its the worst laying time of the year give them time.|`|8GDd6lrnaa	give them laying mash or pellets|`|xIgXabJXaa	My dad's hens stopped laying (some of them) in November!! And they only started recently. Just give them time. Clean water will help too i think. Sand stops them from laying soft eggs just so you know!
0Gyrecxxaa	Butter is a huge no no...it's not even good for you!!|`|HQsmRzPsaa	why would you butter it? just give it toast|`|qeOlkRM0aa	No. They should not have butter. Parrots can have dry toast, but not with butter.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Not all the time. Everything in moderation with a bird. Butter not good for birds and bread is even worse. Contains yeast which thrives in moit areas such as the crop. Toasted is better than just plain bread though. Add many things to treats that you give.|`|jjmJZZD5aa	If it makes him/her happy, I don't see why not!!
aeonmRR2aa	You absolutely need a filter.  This can be canister, hang on back, or whatever, but you must have one, and there is a general suggestion of 10 tank cycles per hour through the filter (that's 550 GPH) but personally I consider that a load of garbage.  That's a good target for the total system water flow, though.  It is crucial to have mechanical and biological filtering.  Chemical filtering is ABSOLUTELY UNIMPORTANT except after medication (use fresh carbon).<br>  <br>  I like hang-on-back because they are cheap, but at 55 gallons, you're starting to get fairly long, so a canister with intake at one end an outlet on the other would work well.  If you use a hang-on-back you can use 2, or use one but also have a powerhead to help circulation.<br>  <br>  I also like undergravel filters (a lot of people don't, but I think they just don't understand how they work).  It's best to use an undergravel filter with a THICK layer (say 2-3") of POROUS substrate, like expanded clay, or perlite/zeolite/crushed lava rock/terra cotta underneath normal gravel.  Note that fish that put gravel in their mouths or lay on the bottom can't have sharp substrates, so if the porous substrate is sharp or rough, put it underneath a layer of normal rounded gravel; you can keep them from mixing with a layer of (fiberglass) window screen material in between (you get it on rolls or by the foot from a hardware store).  And the UG filter should be driven by AIR, not a powerhead, since they must be slow to work correctly.  Dual lift tubes are needed in a 55G tank if you use a UG filter.  Most importantly, you DON'T EVER CLEAN THEM THOROUGHLY!  Vacuum the surface - that's fine.  Don't deep-vacuum them.<br>  <br>  Note that a powerhead with a sponge stuck to it counts as a filter and it's really easy to clean.  But that can't be your only filter.<br>  <br>  Bigger tanks are no different then smaller tanks except that you need help lifting them, and they take forever to fill - you can't just do a water change with a single bucket easily.  And they are heavy, so be careful where you position one.  Lighting is easier since 48" bulbs are cheap.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend starting the new tank with some water from an old tank (at least 5 gallons, preferably 10+).  Put the old water in after the bulk of the new water has already been added, dechlorinated, and cycled through with rinsed activated carbon for at least an hour.  <br>  <br>  Now the tank is full - run the system for another day.  Then, rinse off a filter pad from your old tank in the new tank and add a few ppm of ammonia.  Once the ammonia and nitrate read 0 it is ready for fish.<br>  <br>  <br>  Whether you use a UG filter or not, don't use a bare-bottom tank.  They are ugly, unhealthy, and the reflections from the bottom are not good for the fish.  A glass-bottom tank will always be a terrible home for bottomdwellers, plants, snails, etc.  And also, have a bubbler in the tank, or else use a powerhead that mixes air bubbles into the water jet.  Many fish love bubblers, and air bubbles in a tank really help gas exchange.|`|qMO9S6kvaa	Well, i have a 55 long as well, i do recommend multiple filters, either 2 hang on filters rated 30g or more, or a combination of a large hang on and under gravel filter. One filter for a 55 usually is not enough to get rid  of the dead spaces in the current(look  at the air bubbles flowing through the water after you turn on your filters. look for a spot with little to no movement, too little current will cause a dead spot in the tank, if you see spots, than more current is needed either by having a larger filter, or adding another). Also if it does not come with a lid of some kind than you may need one large one for a 55 or two smaller 20 gallon lids. A Heater Is also a MUST for tropical fish (78 degrees is a nice even ground for most fish). I recommend getting a AIR PUMP to run a BUBBLE STONE and a SPONGE FILTER. I also recommend not having any gravel or sand on the bottom of the tank. Its easier to see how much your fish will and will not be eating, and how much waste there is after however many days or weeks of running it. Hold off on buying fish for a week or two minimum!!! Let your filters run for a while with no life in the tank. <br>  Does this tank come with a stand? or do you have a nice solid dresser for it? it will weigh over 650 pounds so it better be sturdy.<br>  then decorate from there, hold off on real plants for a bit too. And when you start to add fish, do not plop them all in at once. That may cause a ammonia spike which could end up in a loss of fish. Good luck<br>  <br>  AND Cherry, BTW bare bottom tanks are not " ugly, unhealthy, and the reflections from the bottom are not good for the fish. "<br>  Have you ever been to a breeders house before? i have been to several and all of their tanks, no madder the size, are bare bottom. Including a 100 gallon i see often with 6 discus and 2 angels. If they were unhealthy then the discus of all of the species of fish you could have in a tropical tank, WOULD be dead by your standards.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Get 2, 50 gallon filters. I like hang on the back filters, they do make some noise but they are effective, powerheads are for smaller tanks like 5+ gallons. Submersible filters are not a very good choice, but 2 50 gallon filters will keep you from doing a lot of work.<br>  For heaters, just get one, suitable for your tank size, just ask an employee.<br>  As far as fish go, I would start out with non-aggressive community fish, such as Zebra Danios, Guppies and Platys, they all do fine in wide PH ranges and tempature ranges, but no fish can stand very much ammonia or nitrites. <br>  <br>  As you get more advanced I would move to more advanced fish like neon tetras, then to semi-aggressive (African Cichlids) then if you like you can move to a bigger saltwater tank.<br>  You will need gravel and ornaments as well as plants (fake and real) <br>  Don't forget water conditioners and food, net, bucket, gravel siphon.<br>  It is an expensive hobby, all that essential stuff i mentioned will run up to 50+ so good luck!!|`|crSqd4MPaa	Ask your local pet store they will know what to do.
Fc1qkfHJaa	I think that you need to do join up in an arena or preferably a round pen.  Otherwise you will have a long way to drive him away, and it probably won't be effective. Good luck!
