20090310014334AAoVfQZ	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Spam & Bulk Mail	DID I DO THE RIGHT THING BY EMAILING HIM THIS?	HI, was talking to this guy for a whle, went on a date. went awesome..he called me the next day, and he emailed me today. but he didn't write back to my emails. He is such a  good lucking guy , he's got a milion girls on his myspace...his ex was not very pretty and I believe him when he tells me "I've been on his mind". I just have a feeling he is dating other people...I know we've only gone out on one date but I don't want to date multiple people... so, I sent him this email...Did I do good or bad?   READ MY EAMIL:         "What's up? I can't sleep...it happens sometimes.   Well, I have a question to ask you because I like to know things up front.   I see that you read the email I sent u on myspace, I sent you two other messages today..you say you really like me...but it's feeling like a game.   I haven't dated in forever, all I know is I don't want to be someone's "date" for a day of the week or whatever while this person may be dating "other" people. I believe that people know pretty soon whether or not they just want to date one person. I'm not quite sure if you just want to date one person, and you know what, that's okay.   You've met me, when you decide you just want to date one girl, maybe I'll be around. And I hope this doesn't come off as sounding pist or mean, cause I"m not at all. Just telling you how I feel.   I just hate games, if you really want to talk to someone or enjoy their company, I think courteous responses would be reasonable.   Anyways babe, if I "hear" from you (via whatever method) cool, very cool.   If I don't, I can take a hint.   xo"
