20090223112730AAjCrHy	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Help with car accident and small claims court (MI)?	I was recently in a car accident where I was in a left lane and another driver was in the right lane (one way road). She decided to turn into a driveway on the left and not seeing me ran into my car. I took pictures and the police came and took a police report (she got a ticket, not sure what it was for). My insurance said since I have PLPD they can get $500 from her insurance but I wpuld have to take her to small claims court to get the rest. I got the car checked out and the damage is $1500. How do I go about taking someone to small claims court, and is there a lot of fees I would have to pay for? I'm a college student so I don't have a lot of money and I'm worried i'd go through all the hassle and not get any money. Someone else also mentioned I should contact the other driver (she left me her number) and see if she'd pay for it outside of court to avoid costs, is this legal or recommended? Thanks!!

20090223113323AAOKvuJ	Cars & Transportation;Aircraft	Does each FBO have its own rules for currency?	For example, I have a PPL and fly 172s.      Where I rent, if I don't fly for a month, I'm no longer "current".  I have to go up with an instructor to regain my currency.      Is this the same everywhere, or do some places keep you current longer or shorter?      Also, let's say I rent a plane somewhere far away and fly for a day or two.  I don't live there, but I regularly visit there.  Do I have to keep going up for check rides each time I go?  Can they just keep me on file and a year later when I drop by, just let me fly?

Up ahead  there's only a right turn only lane. I turned but had to switch to the furthest left lane immediately to hit the left lane turning light. This was on a green light and the distance is so close.      This is pretty much the exact path everyone coming from that direction, even my managers.      I was still pulled over. After I parked, I looked behind me and told the officer "there's 4 people in a row turning the exact way" and his response is "I can only ticket one at a time".       The only reason I decided to take it to court is because some of my coworkers who were ticketed years ago basically won. I would like to know if there's any specific rules because I sure can't find any.

What I'm wondering is how feasible it would be to install navigation in my car. I realize that I would need the DVD player, however it appears as though the wiring harness to do so is already in place.       Assuming that I can acquire all of the necessary parts, would I be looking at a plug-and-play operation? Do I need anything else besides the head unit, DVD player, and possibly the wiring harness? Has anyone out there done this swap before?      Thanks,   Ben

20090223121038AA2Jzta	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Subwoofer out of whack and "alternator whine"?	So i've researched here and other sites for the answer but I just want to make sure. My subwoofer and amp have worked fine for the past few months, then out of nowhere I get the "alternator whine" sound. And my subwoofer doesn't bump to the music, sometimes it's a constant "boommmmmmmmmmmmmmmm" sound. Even if I have the volume down to 0. I checked the ground, that's not the problem. Which leads me to believe my RCA cable is out of whack, because I removed the negative RCA from the back of my subwoofer and it stopped the whine and constant boom. The sub still kicks a little, because it's still getting power, but not that extra "umph" since I disconnected the RCA.    So before I go out to purchase another RCA cable, I just wanted to make sure that's what the problem is. Thanks.

20090223143521AAzBoGC	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What's this tire tool called?	This tire tool looks kind of like a gun, but you connect it to an air hose that has a lot of air blowing from it and you attach part of a lug wrench at the end of it (or whatever that thing is that unscrews the nuts from tires) and then when you run air through it, it quickly unscrews the nuts from the tires so that you can take them off. When you press the "trigger" it makes kind of a loud whirring sound. It's like a "Vrrrr" sound.
