joiacDUdaa	YES!  It can save money on your bills.. It's called PEAK and OFF-PEAK consumption... For your companies rates and times you might want to look it up online or give them a call... I think for us it's around 10pm-5am for off-peak useage... ALSO, by NOT running more than one household appliance you can save a significant amount of money on your heating, water and electric bills... I've been doing this for 3 yrs. now and save an avg. of $75.00 a month!  <br>  <br>      I don't run my washer/dryer at the same time.. OR my washer, dryer and dishwasher.. Instead, I run them seperate..  This may take some planning and getting used to but, once you do it's pretty easy.  Especially when you see the saving right away.... I started doing this when we moved into our current location... I didn't have a dishwasher, A/C in our old house so when we moved I ran EVERYTHING... WASHER/DRYER, A/C, DISHWASHER, OVEN, tv... Etc... BOY!  Was I shocked at our $114.00 electric bill.. So, I researched online and found a few articles that suggested NOT running all the appliances at the same time.... <br>  <br>     I would run the washer and while the washer was running I would dust/polish and do tidy up jobs around the house... When the washer was done... I would pop whatever needed to be dried OR wait for another batch of "dry-ables" to make a full load.... If the dryer was running I would SOAK the following wash load.. I also noticed since I soaked the wash it would come out cleaner and smell fresher...!  Once the dryer stopped I would run the dryer... *  In the summer I would run the dryer at night when it was cooler so the A/C didn't have to work as hard.... <br>  <br>  My wash scedule goes something like this...<br>  <br>  *WHITES- HOT WATER<br>  <br>  Remove to dry and wash delicates and hang to dry.... <br>  <br>  SOAK next load if dryer is running... <br>  <br>  **WASH children clothing... <br>  <br>  **DRY... <br>  <br>  SOAK towels and sheets... <br>  <br>  Or you can wash a load in the late evening and put it in the dryer the next day...<br>  <br>  <br>  I would also use the dishwasher and run it on time delay so it would run at 3-4am... <br>  When we are asleep and NOT using electric/gas or hot water.... <br>  <br>  Only when the dishwasher is FULL so for us it's every other day... <br>  <br>  Also, hang dry whenever you can.. Clothing will last longer and not show as much wear/tear... <br>  <br>  I also save more money by using baking soda 1 cup for every large load to boost the power of reg. detergent then I use only 1/2 the recommended amount... My detergent last 3x as long and my clothing doesn't fade or show wear/tear as fast.... <br>  <br>  good luck|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	I find that hard to believe.  You are still going to use the same amount of water/electricity/gas whether you do your laundry during the day or night.  I would have to say my answer to your first question would have to be False.  Now to answer your second question.  Use Cold water/Cold rinse when you do your laundry will save you some money.<br>  Make sure you have full loads of laundry and not partial loads.|`|ORpC0ghGaa	There might be some truth in that. For the past few years our local utility company have asked people to do certain things and avoid doing certain things at different times of the day like washing clothing, washing your car and watering your lawn. This might just be a conservation idea, but they have said that there is possible savings in doing laundry at later hours.|`|sDHxandWaa	How would changing the time of doing your laundry save on your energy bill? The amount of energy used is the same no matter what time you do it. It's not like doing 5 bags of laundry before 7pm uses more energy than 5 bags of laundry after 7pm. Use your noodle.|`|AA11506593	First, you would have to have your meter set up for day and night usage. Next, night usage doesn't start (at least from my utility company) until 11 pm.<br>  <br>  Edit: It's the energy rate charged by the utility company folks!!

F7EhEYSYaa	If you are repainting use lighter colors, not blue or Black. <br>  If you have a lot of CLutter around, that might also be a reason.Try getting a smaller desk or nightstand.|`|p1oKWwsSaa	Reducing the clutter will help.  Get rid of any non-functional furniture and look for smaller scale pieces that do double duty (e.g. an ottoman that can be used as seating, has a hinged lid for storage and can also serve as a coffee table if you put a tray on it).<br>  <br>  Another designer trick is to hang curtains higher giving the illusion of larger windows.<br>  <br>  Paint is an cost-effective trick.  Use lighter colors.  Get paint that is semi-gloss or high gloss (not flat).  Flat paint and dark colors absorb light and tend to make rooms look smaller.  Gloss paint catches light and spreads it around making the room look brighter and larger.<br>  <br>  Mirrors can also be used extensively to reflect light and make rooms look larger.|`|uhRKCb9kaa	well for a small roon all you need to do is don't use bed and use metrace and on walls you can use posters,|`|bl8co4hUaa	White or yellow paint, and lots of mirrors.|`|Ndfk6f8taa	Well, first of all, try to have everything against the wall to save space in the middle. If you have a single or twin bed, you can put it diagonally to a corner. This will save space against the wall, it is nice to show a little wall! If you can, get a small round carpet to put near the door, to add a little colour to your white walls. If you have a carpet, vacuum towards the window so that the lines in the carpet face outwards. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>         Taylor!|`|emwtlpIoaa	That's easy, just take out some furniture.

And avoid clutter in your room and maybe take out your desk because that might clear it up a bit. (:|`|0F8hauikaa	Leave only things that you love out for display and put everything else in an assigned place, such as stacked, decorative boxes. (Store things under the bed too if you have room.) It sounds like you could use some additional shelving too, but minimizing and organizing are the main things that will help. Mirrors and wall murals can add depth to a room making them appear larger.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	Use white curtains too to make the walls less choppy looking than a color does.

There is another colour called pumpkin spice that is beautiful too.<br>  <br>  You could also look at soft cool colours such as robin's egg blue, or a soft pale indigo. But I wouldn't pick these if  your room is naturally on the cool side, as it will increase that cool feeling.<br>  <br>  As you know, when people start to relax their body temperature tends to drop a tiny bit, so warmer colours may be more appealing then cool colours.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new room. :)|`|AdDu0AQDaa	Two things to consider here: personal taste, and color psychology. Do a little internet browsing on color psychology and about what effect you want the room to have. Warm colors are for the most part more stimulating than cool colors (blues, greens, etc.).

wol6ECnQaa	Yes bleaching it will make the clothes' color fade to a lighter shade, but that's not dying. Dying is adding a stronger color to the original. If you're planning to bleach let's say khakis which are 100% cotton, and its light-colored then it will work. Adding about 4 cups of bleach to your filled-up washing machine is enough to make turn it white, just make sure that the item is submerged and let it soak for at least 20 mins.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind not to use bleach directly on the fabric as it would ruin it.|`|nKnc90jnaa	Are talking about bleaching a colored fabric?  Bleach probably won't turn the fabric white.  It will more than likely fade to the original color.<br>  <br>  Dying is when you add a darker color to a lighter color.<br>  <br>  Be careful with bleach.  It can eat holes in fabric.

FTC staff reviewed print and catalog advertisements and conducted a "surf" of Internet sites marketing such devices.

According to staff, these types of claims may not be in compliance with the FTC Act, which prohibits false and deceptive advertising.|`|XgpuXjwtaa	They work somewhat.  Generally they only work along line-of-sight, so if the mouse can't see the thing, he won't be much bothered.  My friend has four or five of these in her garage, but still sees signs of mice.

AA10540251	I would use the existing wood trims to accent the floor and not match it. Go to the local lumber store and find the flooring you want then check the color against the flooring until you find a dark color that really goes good together. <br>  <br>  At this time I am doing a Wynne's cot  wall out of mahogany. the trim is light oak. these two colors off set each other beautifully.|`|XgpuXjwtaa	Different wood finishes usually look complimentary as long as they are not too close in color.  If you tried to match, you'd fail, I assure you, and your attempt will make things worse.  You can't refinish the existing wood without a ton of work, assuming you want to do it properly.<br>  <br>  Go with the lighter floor, and I'll bet you'll like how the darker trim nearby works with it.|`|fMyhpElkaa	Paint the rest of the wood white with a Matt finish and this will make your Hard wood floors stand out and look cleaner,

Maybe long enough to start chewing through your pipes to escape it's pipe prison.<br>  I would use a spring-loaded mousetrap unless you plan to release the rodent in the wild somewhere.<br>  No more live flushes.|`|X8n4Qnkeaa	wow. don't you feel bad?<br>   but i wouldn't even flush a dead rat. clogs up the toilet. then you will have something to explain to your plumber!<br>  <br>  and a hefty bill i'm sure!|`|Os8Fwq2Faa	Flush away. Mice won't get trapped in a 4" opening at the toilet and there's no way they can chew through cast iron or PVC plastic while they're battling water and gravity to get out of the septic tank. Better yet, the mice - once dead- will provide needed bacteria and enzymes to your septic tank which will help keep it functioning better.|`|944iJNAdaa	There's not much sense in catching mice in a humane, live trap, if you're going to just flush them down the toilet anyway.  Besides being cruel, why don't you just use a snap trap instead?

D6Noxxz1aa	my company would charge $3.50 per sq/f to install 18x18 tile on the floor (add another $1 sq/f if going up walls, such as in a shower).  this is a straight (square) pattern only.  i would charge an additional $.50 sq/f if installing on a diagonal (diamond) or brick pattern.  any preparation or demolition would be additional, generally priced by the scope of work as opposed to by the hour.  any underlayments than need to be installed over wood subflooring, such as hardibacker or durock would be extra.  good luck!|`|FXnHE7mmaa	In my area it is $2.50-3.50 per square foot for installation (that is just laying the tiles and grouting)..this does not include any prep work or the price of the tiles...prep work is not done by installers here.

We have a Mini which is a yellow orange colour, it attracts wasps, don't kny why, it just does.<br>  If you live in a country or a state such as Florida where bugs are a problem, try turning athe air con right down when you are out, the low temperature will kill the bugs. Use the timer to do this, don't let the temperature stay at a constant as Mr Darwin tells us that a species will move in to take advantage of this new environment.|`|AA10097817	Don't get anything fancy for sleeping in a tent.

q2mzJ48gaa	Yes,  they do twist in, double check the breaker.  If the breaker hasn't tripped then it is possible that the starters or even the ballast is bad on the fixture. You may need to have an electrician come out and check.|`|UQWusO1waa	yes they can be a little tricky. you are right you  have to put them in place then turn them about 90 degrees. so the two pins on each end kinda fit in the contacts. this is if you have bulbs with the 2 pins on each end. you did not say if the lights work for you before. if not there may be a problem wit the "starters" in the fixture.<br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=trouble%20shoot%20flouesent%20light">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=trouble...</a>|`|lAsbD5B7aa	Yes, twist 90 degees, they come out.<br>  <br>  Put in the new one, twist 90 degrees..<br>  <br>  <br>  If both are out, perhaps, perhaps the problem was in the starters and not the bulbs.|`|frUYhmuYaa	once you put them in, assuming they are of the bi-pin type, twist bulbs 90 degrees and they should twist in, (look between light socket and pins, both sides have to line up). if they still won't light, make sure the bulbs are of the same WATTAGE as the ones you replaced. if they still won't work at this point, than it is the ballast. replace ballast with same type OR just replace the whole unit. i would get one with an electronic ballast that can take energy saving T8 bulbs.

SC54ddqKaa	She was basing it off of some sort of knowledge. <br>  Drying an item of clothing alone does not dry very well and it comes out wrinkled. What happens is that the piece goes around with those bars that stick out, goes around the dryer but never moves from where it's tucked on that bar inside. With other laundry, but not stuffed too full, the clothes tumble around and dry better and come out less wrinkled. What you can do if you have one item, is dry it with the next load or stick a couple small towels in there with it. <br>  Too little clothing and too many clothing does not dry very well. The clothes need to tumble dry in the air inside for best drying and wrinkle release.|`|zuxMi8vlaa	More clothes in the dryer= slower drying process and heavier strain on the machine itself.<br>  <br>  You can clean one article of clothes just as well as a whole load, but you run the risk of damaging the clothes more with less articles in the machine, as the machine is designed for a standard weight of clothes to deal with. <br>  <br>  Maytag's Manufactures Manuals states: "For maintaining long life of your clothes and machine, load the correct weight for the appropriate cycle and never overload the machine"<br>  <br>  You will dry your pants faster if you wash them by themselves, but this wastes water and can potentially ruin your jeans depending on the cycle. It will take just as long to wash your jeans though. <br>  <br>  in conclusion<br>  1 article of clothes in a washing machine = same time as a whole load on the same setting<br>  <br>  1 article of clothes in a dryer > a whole load drying at the same setting<br>  <br>  Warning: risk of ruining clothes increases with less clothes in there, risk of ruining machine increases with more clothes in there.|`|2ab81416fb3885d06ec6b6c41274305eaa	One or two items in the dryer will not dry as fast a several, but that does not mean to overload it either.  When I have to wash just a couple of things I always throw in some towels to keep it even.|`|G5mwUnX9aa	if you need to dry one article of clothing throw 2 or 3 towels in with it. it helps to dry faster because it has something to beat around with in the dryer and creates more airflow in the fabric. i hope that makes sense, I'm not sure how else to explain it. Your stepmom sounds like she has some good knowledge. I hope this helps!

2uZXCyeBaa	You're on the right track.  Just add up the total wattage of the stuff you're running.  1800 + the wattage of the bulb in the household lamp + the wattage of the fan (find this by multiplying the voltage by the amp draw).  This is your sustained load, but you should probably get more in case you need to run any tools or anything.  Just tell the person at the rental place how many watts worth of lighting you need to power and they'll rent you the appropriate generator.  Make sure you go by the sustained capacity and not the surge capacity, which is about 20% higher.|`|qkvoAYoeaa	It sounds to as you have to furnish power in the amount of around 2500 watts.  2500 watts is 2.5 Kilowatts or 2.5 KW.  Power generators are rated in KW or Kilowatts, starting at about 3 KW.  A 3 KW generator would handle your needs nicely.  They are available up to 20 KW and more.   Just be certain that nothing you're plugging into the generator is already hooked to another power source....|`|BiknmjLsaa	any generator should work,just make sure the wattage is sufficiant for what you're gonna use it for.

ARUpETXGaa	I would NOT use varnish.  That is something that can peel and and yellow over time.  Buy a good oil based,clear or semi transparent stain like the type used on decks instead.

More topsoil, sand, manure & soil conditioner to help break up the clay more you  add the better your soil will be for growing.  I would suggest using sod & cutting it into plugs & using that with the seed.  Between the time it takes for seed to grow & establish & using wheat straw hoping it doesn't get eaten up by birds, you don't know what or when you might have a lawn.  Exception for fescue or rye, the other ones grow quite slowly & takes a couple of years to come in well.|`|KnZW05kfaa	I made the mistake of doing the same thing last spring and now my back lawn is still bare.

Don't let anyone talk you into anything else as these are exactly what you need to get.   Now once this is primed and dry paint the walls and you'll have a new and lasting finish.<br>  <br>  Regardless of thumbs up or down that result from votes on this answer you need to review who I am, here at Answers and through an internet search. You can also go to my website.  I have been doing restoration, remodel and construction for over 30 years.  I have run into walls just like yours where it had to be done quick and inexpensively. I found this worked on a roll of the dice so to speak on a job where it was an issue in a basement that money wasn't budgeted for.  I told my customer that if he bought the materials I'd try a Hail Mary for him and give him the job since I was already there.  Well, it worked; and it's worked everytime since.  And if you need any additional help with this you now know where to get ahold of me.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.com" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.com</a>|`|Uiajt9ryaa	Peel off what you can, lightly sand it.

nrTVlo8Eaa	Dark walls tend to make a room look smaller, however, small cozy rooms can be very appealing.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I'd pick a nice charcoal gray, like in a men's suit. I'd paint three walls in charcoal gray, and then I'd use painter's tape and make narrow stripes, and either paint them white, black, or pink [not shocking pink], to look like suiting material. Then I'd paint the feature wall either black or shocking pink.<br>  <br>  Then I would use fabrics to bump up the chic black factor..specifically I'd look for a white background with black patterns; either a french toile or the french fleur de lis in black on white. Bold is good because that shocking pink or dark black wall is going to be so distracting.<br>  <br>  I would definitely put a TON of artwork on that feature wall to tone it down some. Something like a series of black and white photos that you take yourself and frame in simple black or white frames and hang in an  eye pleasing way.<br>  <br>  I'd finish the whole thing off with a cheap chandelier painted matte black with light pink shades or pretty pink crystal beads, and then I'd find a way to incorporate pink feathers in my decor somewhere.

Confirm that the ones you get are for exterior use. also try and design the structure to keep them dry as water can leach chemicals out of the cedar and pressure treated that can make short work of metal fasteners. Also confirm the pad is thick enough to take the load of the roof as if it was designed for holding posts it would have been thicker where the posts were planned. If you are where it freezes in the winter months be careful drilling into the concrete as water in a hole will break the concrete when it freezes.

I had a similar experience when I bought my first home a few years ago. While I know that this will sound easier said than done, you absolutely need to set the boundaries now - for your own sanity. In my situation, I did not do that because I did not want to appear rude, and I ended up sitting in the dark basement in my own home at night because my neighbor from a few houses down the road kept dropping by within minutes of the lights going on in my house. Tell him that you appreciate his help and advice, and that you would not hesitate to ask, if you needed any help in the future; but also let him know that you need to get things done at your own pace for a number of reasons [on a side note: none of which, financial or otherwise, you have to disclose to him, by the way]. Thank him again for offering to come back tomorrow, but be firm in telling him that there is no need because you have it covered.<br>  <br>  Again, I completely understand that this is easier said than done - but believe me, if you don't set the boundaries now, you will be miserable because of the situation for a long time to come.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	change the locks..... <br>  <br>  how can you not stand up to this guy?>... friend or no friend, the word is NO!!!!.... thanks, but no thanks!...... followed by 'I'm done with the house for now... out of money and time!"....

Gzk1TQFAaa	In my opinion, my most useful and economical cleaning supply  is my microfiber cloths.  These are goog for most of my cleaning needs and they use no chemicals.  They're the best thing for cleaning mirrors, computer screens, TV's, appliances and more.<br>  <br>  One important cleaning product, in my household, is also a food product.  Reconstituted lemon juice is great for removing soap scum, freshening and cleaning the microwave and neutralizing any chemical residue left on appliances, chopping boards, etc.  It also brings back the shine to grills, pots and pans and such.<br>  <br>  Bleach and ammonia are multi-purpose, inexpensive household cleaners.<br>  <br>  I use my hand-held steamer daily and I'm still finding new uses for it.  It's great for cleaning the fridge, just move the food to one side, steam the shelf and wipe. There's no need to take everything out.<br>  <br>  For the toilet the only cleaner I use is The Works.  This is available in dollar stores and works like a charm.  Just squirt a little in the toilet, wait a minute, swish with toilet brush and flush.  It removes every stain, including under the rim mineral deposits.<br>  <br>  For dish detergent, I like original Palmolive (love that emerald green color) and it does a good job.<br>  <br>  Laundry detergent, either Gain or Arm & Hammer.  I buy these brands based on value and performance.  There are others that are good.<br>  <br>  I don't buy many specialty products, there's no need to, and no desire to.  Hope some of my cleaning tips are useful to you, too.|`|ik7vqqdnaa	I like Simple Green. I use it for everything.|`|G5mwUnX9aa	I like Mean Green for all purpose cleaning. Soft scrub with bleach is good on stains. Mr Clean Magic Eraser is fabulous on just about any surface.

As far as glass cleaner goes, I make my own from a recipe I found years ago. 1 cup of water, 1 cup of alcohol and 3 tbsp of ammonia in a spray bottle. It rarely streaks and it is the best glass cleaner I have ever used.

5CYn53zSaa	Blue grama grass, bouteloua gracilis, is also called eyelash grass.  It is a warm-season bunchgrass that is generally found in ared areas of California and to the east.  The flowers look like eyelashes if allowed to bloom on 12"-20" stems - spring thru the summer. It needs full sun and well-drained soil.  It is often used as a drought tolerant grass for the lawn and mowed at about 1.5 inch level.  it forms low, dense, slowly spreading clumps of then, gray-green blades which are 1"-3" tall which requires little water or maintenance.  Even in the winter the foliage is kind of a tan color with a little green showing through.  It is generally propagated by division or by seed.   I use it as an ornamental allowing it to bloom, but I have several Master Gardener friends that use it as a lawn grass.  <br>  <a href="http://www.theodorepayne.org/gallery/glossary.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.theodorepayne.org/gallery/glo...</a>  then click on Bouteloua gracilis   Family classification is: Poaceae|`|AA11498082	Here you go: <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=blue+gramma+grass&ygmasrchbtn=web+search&fr=ush-ans">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=blue+gr...</a><br>  <br>  A search using the botanical name: <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Bouteloua+gracilis&ygmasrchbtn=web+search&fr=ush-ans">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Boutelo...</a>|`|hd8z7eNRaa	Blue Grama Grass, Blue Gramma Grass (Bouteloua gracilis) is a long lived warm season grass, grows in Zone 3 to 10 likes sun in a neutral to slighlty alkaline soil and likes it dry.<br>  <br>  highcountrygardens.com has seed for Bouteloua gracilis 'Hachita'<br>  <br>  Below is a site about turf grasses you might enjoy<br>  <a href="http://www.riverkeepers.org/pdf/buffalo_blue_gramma_sign.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.riverkeepers.org/pdf/buffalo_...</a><br>  <br>  And this site is a short article about blue gramma grass<br>  <a href="http://www.suite101.com/blog/bobcajun/blue_gramma_grass" rel="nofollow">http://www.suite101.com/blog/bobcajun/bl...</a><br>  <br>  Davesgarden.com also has vendors that carry plants.|`|VEk9jNWIaa	Try this site.

Are you trying to get electricity from them and need solar photovoltaic panels or are you trying to run a heating or hot water system and need solar thermal panels.  It is unfortunate that both of these are known as "solar panels as they are really two entirely different designs.  <br>  <br>  Currently the solar thermal panels are more efficient and therefore have a quicker pay back period usually measured in lower single digit years while the photovoltaic panels have paybacks that are sometimes more than double that unless you figure in increased property values and state and federal subsidiaries and tax credits where available.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Recent advances make any current investment in photovoltaic panels likely to be obsolete in 5 years.1  Still someone has to be on the cutting edge.  Two currently available technologies are concentrating the sun's rays within the collector on a much small chip area.2  This improves the efficiency and lowers the cost as concentrators are cheaper than chips.  The other option is newer chips that accept a wider spectrum of solar energy.3  This has the potential advantage of producing more energy on cloudy days.  This may not be so important in your situation.  Balanced against cutting edge technology will be the possibility of getting older panels at a less expensive cost.  <br>  <br>  The bottem line will always be pay back period.  More panels at a lower efficiency and cheaper price will be just as good as high efficiency at a higher price if the numbers work out. 4<br>  <br>  Between two answers here you now have a criteria for selection and some recomendations.

I ended up cleaning the other day which caused me a lot of pain bending over and learned that I have to wait till I feel better before tackling any cleaning.<br>  <br>  I usually find just starting small and then going from there. Put on some good music and start tidying up. Pick up any dirty clothes and put them in the laundy, then any papers. Recycling anything you don't need, shred old bills and put away papers that you need in an organized fashion. I find using bankers boxes with files in it are great, you can lable it and access them whenver you need them and they are kept safe and tidy and away.<br>  <br>  Then once everything is put away and recycled or tossed if it is garbage you can then start dusting. Use a lighly damp cloth with a tad of dish soap or cleaner of your choice to wipe the surfaces of your room. If you have any glass or mirrors you can use windex or vinigar and water mixture. For any wood surfaces in your room use the damp cloth and then follow with a dry soft cloth to get any moisture off the items.<br>  <br>  Then you can vacuum your room, make sure you get the corners of the celing as cobwebbs can accumulate there. Washing your bedding and open your windows while cleaning, it can help air out the room as well. <br>  <br>  Once you start you will be in a groove and keep going. Once your room is clean just do a light tidy every day and a major cleaning once a week and you will be set.|`|r7xecOqZaa	the way my mum taught me to be neat and motivated was one day when she decided she had had enough and decided to show me what happened to everything that was untidy. while i was sleeping i was changed and wrapped up with the sheets, thrown down the laundry chute and into a warm low water wash in the top loader with my sheets and other cleaning items like tea towels and the dirty dishcloths from the kitchen. i woke up instantly when water started to shower over me and the other laundry and i realized that laundry concentrate was poured over me. i tried to lift the lid but the heavy bottle of laundry concentrate was sitting on top. i was gently washed, rinsed, softened and spun with the laundry. because of the agitation and the spin cycles i was wearing the tea towels when the washing machine finished. the lid was lifted and i was pulled from the wall of the washing machine and thrown into a basket. i was hung to dry on the washing line before being taken inside. after hanging to dry i felt all hard and dry like the tea towels from the detergent. she then grabbed me and placed me on the floor and started vacuuming. she vacuumed me over and then mopped over me with the mop detergents. after being left to dry i was chucked onto the pile of clean clothes, i had a coat hanger threaded through my shirt and clipped onto my bra and then i was hung with all my other dresses in the cupboard.  <br>  <br>  Till this day i have been neat and tidy though since that day i have always loved tea towels. i kinda liked being thrown into the washing machine, being vaccumed and mopped and being hung up to dry.|`|zBmno58kaa	If it's nice outside, open the windows and let the room air out a bit.<br>  <br>  Light a nicely scented candle.<br>  <br>  Spray some lysol on your matress while your sheets are washing!<br>  Make yoursel feel better knowing you're sanitizing.<br>  <br>  Start by picking up.

Then they start looking in the windows,,,, and you know the story from here.<br>  <br>  Not to mention,,, your neighbors are going to complain, and you have to live with them year round.

jkW2b55Qaa	It might decrease the noise, but depending on the kind of insulation you have in the walls, it may not.<br>  <br>  Dampening a sound usually involves the application of sound absorbing/dampening materials.  (Insulation.)  The easiest solution would be to get a foam sleeve that fits over the sump pump tube.  A cover for the motor housing would help as well, though you want to ensure you still allow for cooling of the motor, meaning the cover should give the motor enough space and allow for circulation.|`|0n9unmpVaa	I don't think repiping will do much. <br>  I would try insulating the daylights out of it first.

XCzpQvDvaa	2mm is very thin material to be welding with SMAW(stick).<br>  With 2mm thick material you will get penetration no matter what setting you weld with, the highest amperage you can maintain an arc with and not burn through it what you should use.<br>  On thin material use a low amperage setting, I personally have never even tried welding stick on 2mm metal, we always use Tig for stuff that thin. By increasing the arc length(moving the arc away from metal) you will increase voltage and reduce penetration, by having a short arc length(close to the metal)you will have more penetration and a more convex bead.<br>  If you are worried about penetration look for the HAZ(heat affected zone) around the bead(will turn the metal different colors) if you see or the outline of the bead on the otherside of metal, you are getting penetration. <br>  I suggest getting some thicker material, 3/16-3/8'' thickness for practice and then layering on that, or do fillet joints and just cascade out from the fillet. Stick is too hot for 2mm material.|`|6MkTB6pjaa	You decrease amps for thinner metals watch your speed if your to slow you'll put holes in it to fast and no penetration|`|qkvoAYoeaa	2 mm thickness material is a bit thin to attempt to "stick" weld.  You would certainly have more control with a MIG wire welder.  However, I  would start experimenting with the ampere setting as low as it would go and work up from there.  Higher settings would be used as you weld thicker material.  Once you strike the arc, keep the rod moving along the joint.  Practice running a bead along a single piece of the material, using the highest setting you can without burning a hole through, before actually making the weld...|`|olCIABmbaa	Your question should be "where can I take a basic welding course" because you obviously don't have the first clue what you are doing.<br>  Seriously, take a welding course at night school.
sXnoIFRsaa	put it in the dishwasher|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	I don't think that E-How is going to give you false information.  The chemicals that it is telling you to use are not going to harm your pipe/bowl whatever.  To find out if it works is to try it.  By the ingredients they told you to use--the boiling water will help loosen up the resin.  Salt would be used as an abrasive to remove the resin along with the pipe cleaners.  Alcohol will kill all of the germs that are in the pipe/bowl from everyone smoking from it.  Would I try it on my pipe if I had one?  Yes I would.|`|AA10088272	soak a pipe cleaner in alcohol and run it through the pipe.keep changing the pipe cleaner with newly soaked ones until they come out clean.

T1w4VTXbaa	I think it is too close.|`|KVHYXILkaa	A piano should ideally be situated in a place where it will not be subject to any extreme temperature fluctuations. The best possible place would be an interior wall, and probably not one that houses a chimney. To answer your question, yes, fireplace heat can very possibly cause adverse effects to the piano. It should be far enough away so that the heat from the fireplace will not come in contact with the piano.

Place the punch carefully in the center of the broken screw and strike it smartly so as to make an indentation that the drill will start into.  Drill down through the screw body to the other end.  What's left will then come out, thus leaving a hole.  Take a wooden golf tee and cover the pointed end with white carpenter's glue (Elmer's) and drive it into the hole.  Leave it over night until the glue dries,  then cut it off with hammer and wood chisel.  You can then put another screw back in the same place as where you glued in the wooden piece...|`|Zi5JF9cNaa	You may have to drill it out and fill the hole with a firm setting putty or caulk then redrill the screw hole.....good luck|`|Rn7Kjwdxaa	If you have enough of the screw sticking out you might can use vice grips to get it out.
jcauTPLZaa	In most cases you can. You need to check with the power company first and then hire an electrician and be ready to pay big bucks to have it done.<br>  <br>  <br>  You are going to have to get a permit to do this. I cant see them giving you one for this job. Use schedule 40 pipe elbow from the pole run it to your house elbow up into a new meter base. I would upgrade to 200 amp service, if I was you. If you have never tried good luck pulling 2/0. Once again you will need permits to do this. The power company wont hook you back up till its inspected.|`|j6yiw1Hmaa	You can do the work yourself but judging from the questions you are asking. I wouldn't attempt it. Why don't you call a friend that is an electrician and help him do the work. You will still save a lot of money and your life.<br>  Good luck, be safe
ioZeveazaa	I wouldn't. It is nice that you want to help out but you would definitely harm her new vaccum and I would be upset if that happen to mine. Just wait till a really warm day when the carpet is dry. The moisture in the carpet will get sucked up by the vaccum and cause mold to form inside. Not a good thing. It is also somewhat pointless because the water in the carpet weighs down the dirt so you really won't do any good. Good luck!|`|AA12323302	No, you'll mess up the vacuum because normal vacs aren't used for soaking up water. You need a shop vac for that...a wet/dry vac that is designed for that purpose.  I suggest you just put a fan in that direction to help dry it if you can't remove the carpet completely to a place where it won't get wet....or just fix the roof.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Don't use her vacuum for this.  You could ruin it or worse, fry yourself.  Do you by any chance have a wet/dry shop vac?  If so, that is your answer.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	NO|`|AA10987824	If you want water all up in your vacuum and bag...not a pretty smell.|`|r8p1Yugxaa	No it will ruin the vacuum unless its a wet and dry model.

h89fsAncaa	no it has to have a shower which is at least a 3/4 bath or with tub and shower a full bath.double sinks in demand  and will make or break a sale|`|lLm5uIuDaa	A true master suite has to have a full bath with a separate tub and shower preferably.  While it is common to have closets with doors on either side of an entrance to the bath, walking through a closet would not be the norm nor would it be a good idea.  Rework your layout.|`|CvRscCrjaa	generally a master bath consists of bath tub ,shower and sink. a half is more of a guest bath. and yes it would be weird to walk through the closet to get to the bathroom. love victorians.|`|n560blqraa	No, it can be a 1/2 or 3/4 bath to be considered a master suite. <br>  All you need is for a 1/2 bath is to have a sink and toilet in it.<br>  3/4 is a stand up shower(no tub) toilet, and sink.<br>  Full bath is a tub, sink, toilet<br>  <br>  By definition in real estate speak..1/2 baths constitute suites as well.<br>  It's really about having a secondary room off of the bedroom that defines this. Ex: If you have a master bedroom with an office connected this would also be a master suite. If you have a sitting area in your master bedroom, this too is a master suite.<br>  <br>  My personal advice...Take the full walk-in-closet and turn it into bathroom.  Re-establish where you put your closet. Consider building another closet in your bedroom. This will bring up your resale value. It would be extremely bazaar to walk through your closet to get to the bathroom. This would seriously effect the value you get out of it.<br>  <br>  Adding a 1/2, 3/4 ,or full bath will give you 100% return on your money if done properly. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!!|`|ixOE0onnaa	it would have to be full bath type.|`|AA10042205	A master bedroom is just that, it is where the master of the house sleeps at night, be it either a converted living room, with or without a bathroom.  Walking through a closet to get to a bathroom makes good sense.  You shower, and shave, and walk right into the closet to get dressed.  A master bedroom could also have a half bath, or no bath at all.  Just make you a plan on what you are going to do before you get started.  Take a room, and a measuring tape, and get a length, and a width.  Most house plan drawers use a 1/4-inch scale that equals 1-foot for a measurement.  So a 4-feet room measurement scaled down, equals 1-inch on a drawn plan.  16-feet scaled down is 4-inches, 16 feet, 6-inches= 4-1/2 inches.  Take a bed measure it, 5-feet wide, 6-feet long, scaled down that's 1-1/4 inches wide, by 1-1/2 inches long.  Cut out a piece of paper to those measurements ,and mark it Bed, now place it into the scaled room on the drawn paper.  Same thing for a chair etc.etc.  Measure a coat hanger with a heavy coat on the hanger plus 4-extra inches to keep them from being crammed.  Just have this plan on paper before you start demolition.|`|AA10502773	Yes it would be weird.  When you renovate you have to think a little bit about what the next buyer is going to like/love especially when it comes to plumbing.  Paint is easy to change, not so with the plumbing. Doing this means that your investment adds value to the home not the other way around. You should consult a space planner, or go to a web site called gardenweb.com when you click on that link there is a title "forum" click on that and a drop down box will come up and click "home".  In here go to the bathroom forum or remodel. You can read past post and learn so much and you can also submit a sketch of what your thinking and ask for help. Someone will answer you and probably help with your arangement.   The other thing you can do is get a program that lets you do space planing yourself on the computer with a simple drag and drop program.  But you will probably have to look at what is around this room what is underneath.  If it is on the 2nd floor how are you going to run the plumbing for the toilet. You need water in and out.  This is a huge job that I don't think unless you have a large amount of construction background you could do on your own. Doing a bathroom is one of the most intense rooms to redo.  I know cause I am doing one right now.  I planned my space for 3 years and it wasn't until I started ripping down the old tile and walls that I found where vents for the sinks went.  Where the drains traveled under the subfloor, where the electric was running for existing lights.  You have to have Electrical, Plumbing, structual, finish work, drywall, oh gosh the list goes on and on.  Now as for your bedroom convert to a closet/ bathroom.  There are some pretty cool things you could do in the space where it all fits and looks great like runing the closet down across the interior walls and place bathroom in an L shape around that.  There are some really cool showers now that don't have walls they are just in the middle of the room.  The options are endless so let your imagination roll but get some that can help you at least with the plans for it. Then you can sub out the work yourself if you want and do whatever work you can.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	if you going through all the trouble of adding a toliet and sink it would be silly not to add at least a small shower.  3 square feet will not be missed from the walk in closet if it means adding a shower.<br>  i have seen walk in closets in bathroom but the other way is kinda tacky unless you hide the clothes with bifold or siding doors. it also wastes alot of space in your closet making it walk through.  If you plan on living there for a long time feel free to do anything you want but if not i would trying coming up with a better floor plan.
VWLtJoX2aa	The easiest way is always pay to have it done.|`|5de5a32d9ca982c8ba34be17b8c5d254aa	The tiles are held in place by a very durable glue, there is no nice way to take them off, you will need a hammer and a flatbar, put the faltbar under the tile and start to tap at it, until it comes off, then try to match the tile, use tile glue and replace it, if worst comes to worst you can retile it with a different color and buy some epoxy paint (used for appliances and countertops) then give it a good even coat with the color of your choice.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  -HANDYMAN|`|Yio80F4yaa	It would be my Professional opinion, that because you are asking the question you should get someone with tiling experience to replace all the tile on the table. As far as the rest of the table, if the finished is in good shape, use steel wool to rub down the finish. Use a stain with polyurethane already added, brush it on and wipe with clean dry cloth, let dry and your done. if the finish is pretty rough, use sandpaper instead of steel wool and finish with the same stain/polyurethane added product. If the table is painted, sand and paint.
Rn7Kjwdxaa	I'm in SC and I've never heard of putting insulation along the foundation wall.  You're supposed to put it with the paper side up towards the heated space and use the little wires between the floor joists to keep it in place.  You do need a plastic vapor barrier on the ground to keep moisture from coming up.  As far as vents, I keep ours open year around.  Hope this helps.  Maybe you could call around to handymen or contractors in your area to see what they recommend.  Perhaps they do things differently in your area.|`|944iJNAdaa	It's a little difficult to understand your question, because "rafters" and "ceiling" always refers to the roof structure - while crawl space insulation normally goes between the floor joists.  I get the idea someone installed a vapor barrier on the bottom of the floor joists, and your inspector would be right, this isn't correct.  If there's any vapor barrier, it would normally be on the ground (this is a great idea, by the way, and code requires it where I live), with possibly another vapor barrier facing the heated interior of the floor (this isn't routinely installed, though).  I'm guessing this must not be fiberglass insulation, since your inspector wants you to install it against the concrete foundation wall instead.  I've always used fiberglass insulation between the floor joists, with wires or chicken wire holding it up, so I'm not quite sure what he's suggesting here.
bFOcQeDCaa	You didn't say what type of wasp you have. Paper wasps have a nest out in the open and are easy to get rid of by waiting until dark and cutting it off what ever it's attach too into a bag and putting in the freezer to kill them or into a fire. Another type have a nest in a hole in the ground or tree or building. If you have a lot round the house odds on it's not more than 200 meter radius from where you are. Depending on where it is will determine how you get rid of it. One in the ground can be exterminated with a cup of petrol poured in and the hole plugged. Anywhere else requires a powder poison which you could get from your local council. If they don't have it they will be able to tell you where you need to go.<br>  In every case this needs to be done after dark when they are all home.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Get an exterminator.|`|Tvcn83Adaa	You need to find the nest and destroy it.  <br>  <br>  To keep them out, I've found that making a small hole or two high up in a two liter soda bottle, just big enough for them to get in.  Fill the bottom of the bottle with a mix of white sugar, apple juice and a few pieces of raw meat.  Just two or three inches of fluid in the bottom of the bottle.  The wasps fly in, eat, and can't get back out.  Place the bottles as far as you can from your house.<br>  <br>  There is a company that makes funnels that you pop into the bottles as well, and they work too.
