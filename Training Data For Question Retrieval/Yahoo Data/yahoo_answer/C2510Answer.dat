WYngdeacaa	There wasn't much.  Joseph Kenedy Sr. Suffered a stroke in like late 1961 or early 1962.  By 1968 when Robert was killed, he was confined to a wheelchair.  Half his side was paralyzed which made speaking almost impossible.  After Jack's assassination in 1963, he was even more withdrawn.  At that point he had outlived three of his children.    However he felt about her, he pretty much kept to himself as he couldn't really tell anyone.    Jackie really didn't talk about Jo Sr. because he was not an influence in her life.    After Jack died, Robert Kennedy was basically the head of the family.

It tends to get a little bit boring listening to the characters feelings for  a hwole poem.  Add some story... if your are doing shakespeare, tell us what his lie was, and make it murderous! classic.  I love your use of calamity, it helps set the shakespeare theme.  keep up with old time vocab to make it real authentic.  Good start! keep it up!

C4A8DsFSaa	I haven't been to CSSSA, but I think your questions are easy to answer, so I'll give you my responses.    1.  How good do you have to be?  It always comes down to one person's opinion on one day.  There are never guarantees.  But to not try would be a crime since you have the opportunity.    2.  Easy making friends?  Do you usually make friends easily?  If you don't, there's no reason to think that would change.  Except for the fact that if you're all part of the same summer school you automatically have something in common, right?  When I went back to college to finally finish up my degree, I was in my 30s and everyone else in their late teens/early 20s.  But it was the easiest time I ever had talking to people because we all had the same huge thing in common - hey, what's your major?    3.  Was the experience worth it?  No one can answer that for you.  How badly do you want to go?  What do you expect to get out of it?  Do you have realistic goals?  As a very late bloomer artist (age 55) I would say anything having to do with art is definitely worth it.  Only you can judge.    Sorry I couldn't give you real experience answers, but maybe this will help.    Sara

NYU37jfGaa	Egypt was a large and powerful country, Israel was a very small country.    Egyptians worshipped many different gods and goddesses, whereas the Israelites were monotheistic, worshipping only one God.  Egyptians made many paintings and statues of their deities, whereas the Israelites were dead against making images of God.    Egypt produced large and impressive works of architecture, the pyramids, the temples at Thebes, Abu Simbel etc, whereas no such impressive works were created in Israel.    The ancient Egyptians mummified their dead when they could afford to, the Israelites buried their dead wihtout mummification.    clothing is another area of difference.  Egyptians mostly seem to have worn revealing clothing, men just a sort of short kilt  most of the time(even the King seldom wears much more), women close-fitting sheath dresses.  Israelites, both men and women, tended to wear robes which covered their bodies much more fully, and women in particular were expected to keep their heads covered.    The majority of the population of Egypt were peasant farmers, farming the land, keeping livestock etc, and the majority of the people of Israel probably lived int he same way, so that would be one similarity.    Both societies were ruled by kings, which would be another similarity.  And both societies considered their kings to have been appointed by God, which would be another similarity.  However, the Egyptians considered their own kings to be semi-divine, like gods on earth,a nd I don't think the Israelites thought of their kings like that.    They probably ate a fairly similar diet.  Bread made from grains of various kinds would be the stape diet in both countries.  They would grow fruit and vegetables, and keep animals for meat.  I think pigs were regarded as unclean animals by both societies, which would be another similarity.    I think housins was also pretty similar.  Both Egyptians and Israelites built houses out of mud bricks, which were suitable in their hot, dry climates.      Circumcision of boys seems to have been practiced by both the Egyptians and the Israelites, though it does not seem to have had the same religious importance to the Egyptians as it did in Israel.|`|iH9bRo5Jaa	isarealities are jewish
k42OcjGLaa	The author believes that love is rare and that not too many people ever experience true love. The couple mentioned should hide their happiness, according to the author, because the people around them have no love. Religion and poetry, according to the author, is used to fill the absence of love and is used to make their live's easier. Thats why, if everyone was loved, the author asks "what could religion and poetry count on?".|`|G3czAd0caa	love isn't easy to find but someday you'll find your true love i guess|`|ynS9RQFTaa	I think the writer isn't really saying whether or not they believe in true love, rather as a third person.  Watching the jealous, loveless individuals who might pretend and never laugh.  The poet questions true love (in the beginning), 'is it normal', but then goes on to talk about the 'happy couple' and 'their little celebrations'. I think that the poet is not denying True Love, rather, questioning the point of it...'Perfectly good children are born with out its help'.  Maybe the Poet has not met anyone they really love because I think the poem has a slightly jealous twinge to it.

W9C7m130aa	I suggest you take classes and challenge yourself more by becoming comfortable in your own style. Practice, practice, practice. We all get scared at some point and it can be very nerve racking putting yourself out there, only to judged. But you have to think positive and know that every experience is a learning experience. You shouldn't always want to win at every thing, because how will you get better if you never fail?    But with out practice and properly preparing yourself, trust me you will fail more often. So good luck to you, try to work the fear instead of against it. Listen to more music, express yourself more, and don't be afraid to put yourself out there. You will be fine!

tbrvyLb0aa	Well, that's up for debate. It does depend on the poem's style and the languages involved. (No rhyming makes it a lot easier to translate.) And there are some languages that just naturally translate well with rhyming and such, but English isn't really one of them. But there are a lot of poems that are very important in our language that have been translated from other languages (like Homer's Iliad and The Odyssey.) Sure, they'd probably be better in Latin, but at least we aren't missing out on them all together.|`|4n0xzZJhaa	It really depends on the translator.  Verbatim translations lose a lot, but it the translator is a poet and can translate ideas as well as words, then the poem can be as good and possibly even better.

46zxsu1haa	At your age you should be taking at least 4 ballet classes a week at a good ballet school. (This amount doubles as you get older.) You could add a modern or jazz class to that, but save the hip hop for later when you have built up your body and skills more. Ballet is the basis for all dance and is very necessary for anyone who wants to be a professional no matter what type of dance they wish to do.    Maybe if you show your family this answer, they will understand what it takes and let you take more classes.  Best of luck to you!|`|Bx6xTLRbaa	It depends on what style and what career you want to do in the dance world. There's a difference if you want to be in a ballet company or a backup dancer. It's always great to have an impressive resume (lots of experience in different styles) but I think most people prefer talent over experience (if they had to choose one or the other). Beg your mom to take more classes. Also, always warm up, stretch, and dance everday at home. Even though you can't put this on a resume it will put you ahead of the game :)|`|pbTXcRjGaa	it depends on how good you are, but a lot of people i know dance a few hours almost every day of the week.
tdulyzXXaa	I wouldn't call it a betrayal. A life philosophy is not necessarily inflexible. Indeed, a life philosophy must evolve and adapt to changed or changing circumstances.|`|v1BK73Ryaa	My life philosophy has gone from fairly conservative and rigid to being much more open minded and liberal.    At this point i basically feel like I am in a place where I can try just about anything and have the confidence to know that it won't become a part of my life unless I consciously choose it to be.  I've tried drinking for example, and I thought it was awesome so I have been drinking (same with a few other things).  I also have the confidence to know I can enjoy things in moderation, I'm a very responsible drinker but I have a lot of fun.    I know a lot of people try things just for the sake of trying them, or because of peer pressure or because they were drunk!  All of these are bad reasons and at that point you are making a choice to try something against how you normally live your life because you are too weak and insecure.  When you are in a position to try everything because you want to, and know that you will not get trapped to it for any other reason than because it makes you happy then that is power.    I'm all about trying different things, shame plays no role in my life anymore (less and less everyday).  The only role shame should play in anyone's life is when they are unable to make responsible choices due to ignorance, maturity  or some their age.    So it's basically about being honest with yourself, and understanding the motivation behind your choices.  In that way you will better be able to judge what will bring you happiness, and what will bring you pain.  Some of it you will never know and you just have to go with your gut, sometimes experience is the only way.      Shame however, is more often than not just a tool to hold you down because most people are too stupid and irresponsible to be free (they will ruin themselves).|`|2scdUqkMaa	A few times I should have knocked a few people on their butts and to back off.

Pu7TON79aa	For colleges with major dance programs go to College Confidential/Dance Major website. They list tons of colleges and conservatories for dance and you will find comments from people who attend them and people looking to attend.  http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/danc...  Off hand I can say that Indiana U has a good rep for ballet. A number of pro dancers have attended that school although most don't go to college until after their dance career is over. Many  (female) dancers are apprentices in companies as early as 16 or 17 (they finish school early), or join a company right after H.S. graduation. I am hoping to become an apprentice at the end of this school year.    * You will also find dance college listings In "Dance" Magazine's College issue.      If you are looking for a more rigorous ballet program while in H.S., check with the nearest ballet company. They may have an affiliate school or can steer you in the right direction for a local school.|`|PeCm21meaa	for any kind of arts, dance included, i would suggest applying to Julliard.  it is incredibly prestigious and hard to get into, but it will give you lots of credit in the dance world!  talk to your college adviser about other options :) hope this helps!|`|pbTXcRjGaa	depends where your from.

They then put the swastika everywhere. It was the only image on the German national flag, it was on the Iron Cross medal issued from 39-45, it was on German military uniforms and documents. The extensive use of the symbol by the Nazis has made the swastika a symbol of Nazi antisemitism because that is what people most commonly associate the swastika with.    To be honest, I would remove the whatever it is because of the common association of the swastika. It was not originally bad, but thanks to the Nazis, a lot people perceive it to be. Neo Nazi parties in America and Europe still use the swastika as their symbol.|`|OmSJR5UFaa	The ancient swastika symbol was rotated by the Nazis to stand on a point, rather than stand square-like.

The West tends to ignore the Eastern tradition of the symbol as good luck, given the enormity of the horror of the Holocaust.    In most cases, I think the symbol used in the East is actually a mirror-image of the symbol used by the Nazis, rather than identical, although I'm not sure about any of the Buddhist versions specifically.

The Nazis 'adopted' the swastika as their own symbol. The Nazis helped carry out a genocide, known as the Holocaust, where 6 million Jews were exterminated. They also killed Gypsies, homosexuals, phsyically and mentally disabled persons, Jehova's Witnesses, etc etc.     Your swastikas may not mean you are anti-semetic, per se, but it does seem to mean you are ignorant. Please don't expect any human being to "get over it," we must never forget.|`|9CN0ZvAVaa	Well, Hitler used the symbol for the Nazi party. Some of the western world knows little of the origins of the Swastika symbol, and automatically connect it to Hitler and his antisemitic views. But little do they know, before he took the symbol, the swastika is a symbol of good fortune in many religions such as hinduism, Buddhism, etc..Because of the wide usage of the symbol by the Nazis, it is seen as being antisemitic. Of course there is nothing wrong with the symbol, and you should continue to educate people of it. But you can't blame them either, they just don't know.     And keep in mind that the symbol might mean something to you, but something totally different to others. Respect that.|`|pI5jKfmaaa	It depends on your culture and beliefs as the Swastika has different meanings / significance in different sets of people across the world. Hence you should get a comprehensive picture of Swastika's history,given below, to make yoir own interpretations.     The swastika is an extremely powerful symbol. The Nazis used it to murder millions of people, but for centuries it had positive meanings. What is the history of the swastika? Does it now represent good or evil?     The Oldest Known Symbol     The swastika is an ancient symbol that has been used for over 3,000 years. (That even predates the ancient Egyptian symbol, the Ankh!) Artifacts such as pottery and coins from ancient Troy show that the swastika was a commonly used symbol as far back as 1000 BCE.     During the following thousand years, the image of the swastika was used by many cultures around the world, including in China, Japan, India, and southern Europe. By the Middle Ages, the swastika was a well known, if not commonly used, symbol but was called by many different names:     China - wan   England - fylfot   Germany - Hakenkreuz   Greece - tetraskelion and gammadion   India - swastika   Though it is not known for exactly how long, Native Americans also have long used the symbol of the swastika.   The Original Meaning     The word "swastika" comes from the Sanskrit svastika - "su" meaning "good," "asti" meaning "to be," and "ka" as a suffix.     Until the Nazis used this symbol, the swastika was used by many cultures throughout the past 3,000 years to represent life, sun, power, strength, and good luck.     Even in the early twentieth century, the swastika was still a symbol with positive connotations. For instance, the swastika was a common decoration that often adorned cigarette cases, postcards, coins, and buildings. During World War I, the swastika could even be found on the shoulder patches of the American 45th Division and on the Finnish air force until after World War II.     A Change in Meaning     In the 1800s, countries around Germany were growing much larger, forming empires; yet Germany was not a unified country until 1871. To counter the feeling of vulnerability and the stigma of youth, German nationalists in the mid-nineteenth century began to use the swastika, because it had ancient Aryan/Indian origins, to represent a long Germanic/Aryan history.     By the end of the nineteenth century, the swastika could be found on nationalist German volkisch periodicals and was the official emblem of the German Gymnasts' League.     In the beginning of the twentieth century, the swastika was a common symbol of German nationalism and could be found in a multitude of places such as the emblem for the Wandervogel, a German youth movement; on Joerg Lanz von Liebenfels' antisemitic periodical Ostara; on various Freikorps units; and as an emblem of the Thule Society.     Hitler and the Nazis     In 1920, Adolf Hitler decided that the Nazi Party needed its own insignia and flag. For Hitler, the new flag had to be "a symbol of our own struggle" as well as "highly effective as a poster." (Mein Kampf, pg. 495)     On August 7, 1920, at the Salzburg Congress, this flag became the official emblem of the Nazi Party.     In Mein Kampf, Hitler described the Nazis' new flag: "In red we see the social idea of the movement, in white the nationalistic idea, in the swastika the mission of the struggle for the victory of the Aryan man, and, by the same token, the victory of the idea of creative work, which as such always has been and always will be anti-Semitic." (pg. 496-497)     Because of the Nazis' flag, the swastika soon became a symbol of hate, antisemitism, violence, death, and murder.     What Does the Swastika Mean Now?     There is a great debate as to what the swastika means now. For 3,000 years, the swastika meant life and good luck. But because of the Nazis, it has also taken on a meaning of death and hate.     These conflicting meanings are causing problems in today's society. For Buddhists and Hindus, the swastika is a very religious symbol that is commonly used. Chirag Badlani shares a story about one time when he went to make some photocopies of some Hindu Gods for his temple. While standing in line to pay for the photocopies, some people behind him in line noticed that one of the pictures had a swastika. They called him a Nazi.     Unfortunately, the Nazis were so effective at their use of the swastika emblem, that many do not even know any other meaning for the swastika. Can there be two completely opposite meanings for one symbol?     In ancient times, the direction of the swastika was interchangeable as can be seen on an ancient Chinese silk drawing.     Some cultures in the past had differentiated between the clockwise swastika and the counter-clockwise sauvastika. In these cultures the swastika symbolized health and life while the sauvastika took on a mystical meaning of bad-luck or misfortune.     But since the Nazis use of the swastika, so|`|AA12095483	The Sanscrit symbol faces in the opposite direction from the swastika.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	the Swastika is now associated with Nazis.   The 45th infantry division (american) patch was a swastika.     The problem is people associate it with Hitler and dont learn what the Swastika actually means.      Fritz Beckhardt was a German Jew who was a German ace during WW1 who wore a Swastika for good luck on flights. He must be a racist to his own people.|`|Zp93fab3aa	The swastika was used as a symbol by the Nazi party, who was responsible for the extermination of millions of jews during the Holocaust.    It would offend jews.  Just explain that excuse to thme I'm sure they'll understand.

Edward's soft voice came from behind me. I turned to see him spring lightly up the porch steps, his hair windblown from running. He pulled me into his arms at once, just like he had in the parking lot, and kissed me again.    This kiss frightened me. There was too much tension, too strong an edge to the way his lips crushed minelike he was afraid we had only so much time left to us.    As Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge, Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger. In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacobknowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching, Bella has one more decision to make: life or death. But which is which?    BREAKING DAWN    Breaking Dawn is the fourth installment in Stephenie Meyer's  Twilight Series. Picking up where Eclipse left off, Bella Swan and Edward Cullen are counting down the days until their wedding. It's the talk of the small town of Forks,  Washington. Bella's acceptance of Edward's proposal means an Ivy League education, a step up the financial ladder and the shadow of death in his promise to make her a vampire.

LMAO|`|wOcTPbf7aa	Youtube.com    :)
m9bRpmN4aa	I too, have my OWN theories about the titles and the pictures.    Twilight - Meaning it's the best time for Vampires. Best title I think :) Hands and Apple symbolising forbidden love, the foridden fruit being the one that tastes the sweetest, but we all already know that one.    New Moon - I am assuming New Moon means the moon coming out after a certain time, I know that it's mentioned in the book though. New Moon sounds like a fresh title to me :) The flower? Not quite sure to be honest, but I think it represents innocence.    Eclipse - Jacob says that in the book, saying something about how he doesn't want to 'wait' for an Eclipse, something along those lines when Bella told him she was choosing Edward. When I hear the word 'eclipse' I think of a dark sky and a bright light (don't ask me why haha). The red ribbon to ME symbolises danger, and being torn between two loves.    Breaking Dawn - Meaning transformation, new beginning, change and growth. I THINK that the chess set symbolises which step to take next? What choice to make? Surrender? Try and take a risk but get beaten by doing so? Let the other person win? Or think of a strategy to win against the opponent? That I think relates to the whole thing with the Volturi coming to kill them.    I am definately sure about the breaking dawn cover :) but Stephanie Meyer explains it all on her website anyway.|`|sRGESDz1aa	breaking dawn- because bella is now the "queen". she is the strongest of all of them.    the titles are just names that sound good together and have something to do with vampires. i dont think there is really anything behind them.    new moon- i have no frickin clue what that is supposed to mean    eclipse- something about "breaking away"|`|58d4c5f78f3d1c66eddbabe45ac7e097aa	yeah, i also read the stuff on the website. it's all pretty symbolic and everything.    but meyer didn't say anything about the cover for new moon or eclipse. I have no theories on the flower, but i think the ribbon symbolizes how close they all were to death. maybe?     yep. cool stuff :)|`|purcHnb4aa	I LOVE TWILIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|DFXS4SB4aa	Meyer actually covers all meaning behind the covers on her website.|`|WTOK5ZOzaa	How about Sunlight cause Edward Cullen is a tosser and can piss off.|`|SYKGIiQkaa	All the titles and book covers = Quick brah we need to put something on this waste of paper or we are in deep crap man!|`|lcP4AjhLaa	life|`|98cJg2pCaa	Twilight... Dont have theories about the name. But apparently the fruit is the forbidden fruit or something.     New moon is the darkest time in bellas life... when a new moon is coming there is no moon. I think the white a red rose is a good cover and i think the small petal is bella being torn away from edward.     Eclipse is like edward and jacob crossing paths and the tear in the ribbon represents how she is torn between the two.     The red peice of the chesse set represent the old bella and the queen represents the new, vampire bella.    but this is just what i think    xo
fmHyfVmVaa	I really try to avoid suffering like the plague, LOL! Yet, none the less I do have times of just not being on top of my game.  But seriously, I tend to withdraw. Mostly because if I am out of sorts it is because there is a lot of internal work happening, I am beginning a shift, or on rare occasion I am angry.   I generally feel like most of the time when it happens the biggest part of me is pulled within & I don't have enough to really be functional out here with as far as dealing with a lot of outside stuff. My experience also has been that venting to people just does not help me that much, I have to go within, I call it going hunting, & find the issue & the solution. My close friends who know me well have just come to expect that I will from time to time just check out for awhile.  In my younger years I whined a lot! I was always looking for an out side band-aide to fix an internal hemorrhage. I'm sure you get the picture & know already about how well that worked.  This is just me & some need to vent & venting can be our friend, but I tend to just go deep.  Blessings!|`|RDxwA15kaa	I do both. Obviously the times when I bellow it out dont last long, the rest of the time its quiet desperation.|`|GtazNrplaa	Last time I bellowed the cows came home early.|`|YmtNel5haa	suffer silently.  always.  mmhhmm.|`|UY6c7DG8aa	Yeah... who isn't|`|5uzHW4CYaa	Silently. I very seldom let people in and it's very, very rare when I let someone close enough to really see me. I'm afraid of just about everything, but the people that I know and talk to, they think I'm the most confident and put together person they've ever met. But the truth is, is that I'm nothing like that. I easily put up a front, covering who I really am, and I wonder if anyone will be able to not have me tell them about myself, but for them to figure me out on their own.|`|vVmsJRTbaa	im definately the one causing a riot|`|tUxI10Teaa	i'm a silent sufferer  i love attention (shallow, but honest), but not when it comes to pity  i've had a lot of unfortunate events in my childhood, but probably 75% of the people who know me don't know or have forgotten about my past, and i like it like that ...so when i suffer from it, it is silen indeed|`|HfF4EAAhaa	I think most people suffer silently. xD "Quiet desperation", as they say.

You don't have to suffer silently nd you don;t have to bellow it at the top of mountains.|`|gMbS9ke8aa	Yes, sometimes. It's hard to get up at a mountain to shout your heart out.. But it really depends on you if you will let yourself suffer or speak up. Sometimes, we can't help it specially if were not given an opportunity or a right to speak. But it will be best if we can tell what we want to avoid the suffering of our feelings.|`|yuqZ6M96aa	i dont say anything, and really dont like attention hence why im such a recluse, but for my close friends (both of them) i try to make time spent together enjoyable for them
egeuNalTaa	hi waka, i have no idea what Seattle likes in their applicants, but maybe a trip there will give you some idea.  Everything changes when you involve yourself in studio classes, one thing leads to another, and then when you think you've got it down, then there's grad school.    Is your art good enough?  What do you think?  You might ask another question, is Seattle the best place for you?  There are good schools all over the place, not that Seattle isn't good.  You might find some excellent colleagues in smaller, less expensive places like Community Colleges and local Universities.  School is as much about meeting people as it is about study, maybe more so.  Your work is good, yes it is, and i can't help but think that you are just starting a journey that has no end.  good luck, be well and warm, jb|`|g8kIjpwSaa	Every art school has their own judging standard.

7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Hehe I have what I call a doodle book, although not really a doodle, it's more of a scribble of various thoughts and some of it not directly related to a story I am writing. It a combination of journal/story outline.      Othertimes I'll sit down and write what comes to me right in front of a word doc or docx application. Both work well for me.|`|swxiulwtaa	I have an idea for a story, and I posted the plot on Y!A 4 times, edited after each time posting, I got some plot holes pointed out so I fixed it. It generally got positive answers.   I actually came up with the main character before the plot. I liked to think about this character while I listened to music. The main character is a young celebrity, and songs about fame and money (Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous, Beverly Hills, Paper Planes) helped me create the character. So if anything, listen to a song that reminds you of the story and get active! (Jump on a trampoline, run, dance) moving helps me be creative too.|`|qRgPA9fSaa	I find ideas for the book I am writing by listening to music that I really like, sometimes I will think of a scene before I know why that scene happens, the music just suits that scene  = )|`|SYKGIiQkaa	Most of my characters are straight from my dreams. Many of them are based on real people or television characters that I have severely modified. Several of them are based heavily upon the imaginary friends I had as a child.  However the most frequent source, I would say, are the traits I pull from real people.|`|5L6z92Iqaa	I have an overly active imagination at times but I people watch and ask What If? to everything. I wonder what peoples lives are like behind the facade they show the world.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	I like your way!  It sounds interesting!    Basically, I get my inspirations from the world around me...things that have happened (or are happening) in my life or the lives of people I know, something I see on TV or in a movie or hear on the radio might spark an idea for something totally different, sometimes I'll be at work and a story will pop into my head that relates to my job, or I'll be working on one of my hobbies (sketching or music usually) and a story comes to me, or sometimes my dreams...I rarely ever remember my dreams so when I do, it's usually something especially vivid and I just build a story around it.    Another thing I used to like to do was sit at a coffee shop or park and just observe people.  I'd lock onto a person that seemed different somehow and build up a story for why I thought they might be the way they were, or how they got to that position in their life.  Once, a friend of mine was telling me about an older homeless gentleman that everyone knew and chatted with out in California when he was there visiting.  One day, my friend saw some candles on the park bench he used to sit at and chat with this man...and upon asking around, he found out the gentleman had died.  But, oddly enough, in all the time people spent being polite and sharing conversation with the man, nobody really knew a thing about him!  It bothered me so much that I wrote a story for the man.  Of course, since I didn't know him at all, and just heard of him second hand, my story couldn't have possibly been accurate, but it gave me a sense of peace to give this man a story.    Anyway, that's some of the ways I come across ideas...Basically, I don't really try for that story, but rather it just pops into my mind.  I usually hear the characters' voices in my head, almost as if they are telling their own story, and I'm just there to put it out on a "visible plain", if that makes sense.|`|QJpbPWxaaa	I lay down on the bed on my back with the lights off and my eyes closed.

ynk7hWjGaa	Hi there -  There is pkenty of videos on YouTube demonstrating how it was done.    Basically, the curtain went up and sheilded the lady from view,  then whilst Copperfield was showing you an obviously fake radar image and doing his 'magic',  the stage platform which the audience, cameras and himself were on slowly turned to the right, enough so that the audience did not feel it, and that when the curtain was lowered, the statue was no longer in view.      To make the statue come back, they just moved the stage back to the origional position|`|zWBYxMvWaa	Don't you mean How?     As in     HOW DID DAVID COPPERFIELD MAKE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY DISAPPEAR?  not  WHO DID DAVID COPPERFIELD MAKE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY DISAPPEAR?|`|1mpnSoFtaa	I think David Copperfield is one of the saddest stories I've ever known.  I didn't know it had anything to do with the Statue of Liberty though.  Daniel Radcliffe was so cute in the movie when he was young.  Sorry that wasn't any help. HAPPY 2009!!
AA12016117	One annoying inaccuracy was that Henry had two sisters, Margaret and Mary; the series merged the two into one murderous female called Margaret - so we wouldn't get all those "Marys" mixed up!  In fact, by wiping Mary, they also wiped Lady Jane Grey from history.  (She was the granddaughter of Mary, and was Queen of England for nine days.)    Here's an interesting site on all the inaccuracies:    http://tudorswiki.sho.com/page/The+Tudor...

cxDbdhELaa	Usually, the display of virtue is pretentious.  Consequently, indulging in vices yields hypocrisy,,,and visa versa|`|AA11635601	Well what it's SAYING is that that vice recognizes that virtue is a superior thing and so it engages in hypocracy, that is, pretends to be virtuous, as like, a gesture of respect to it, the way we all might wear green on St. Patrick's day as a sign of recognition of respect of the special day.    However, catchy though it is, it's wrong.    Hypocracy is the human attempt to lie about our morality by pretending to be one way when we're really another way.  People pretend to be virtuous (vice does not pretend to do anything)  people pretend to be virtuous to win the acceptance of other people.  Like me I'm honest!  REally I am!  When in fact, the guy may be a liar, or a thief.(have his vices)  IF he stood up and said hey like me, I'm a thief, people would dismiss him and say we don't like you because you are a thief.  So he pretends to be virtuous.  It's just one more human lie.   Whoever said that quote about vice's tribute to virtue or whatever it was should snap out of it.|`|dcovK6oqaa	I se that the only wait to get along with others is by being a hypocrite, so I would call it a virtue i don't like hypocrisy like anybody else but what can you do. Everyone is a hypocrite that's the way it goes. people would never accept you for who you really are so you pretend and you end up playing a fake role all your life ,but you at least got along with everyone in a hypocrisy manner. yes it is a virtue.|`|tcRpXd7Vaa	One who tries to be virtuous but has vices will be seen as a hypocrite.  and it doesn't work the other way around.     For one who triest to be with vices but has virtues will not be seen as a hypocrite.    So its Vices tribute to virtue.
UZxeBrxQaa	The crusades were a stupid thing.    Any war based on religious beliefs, and undertaken by religious zealots, is flawed by its very definition.    Nothing was accomplished by the crusades except a lot of dead individuals on both sides.  Not to mention a great deal of expense.|`|KGr3Y7MHaa	the initial positives of the crusades was a unified piety within europe and i think it started in good faith though the negative outcomes was that it was was quickly overtaken by those in power who sought to manipulate and decieve the people into doing terrible things to further their own ambitions. i believe the initial crusades were a pilgrimage to to a significant spiritual place to but along the way things morphed into insanity, a warlords paradise, and which is possibly the catalyst for the troubles we have today in certain parts of the world
USBwHWnFaa	The railroads were one reason. They charged high fees (without regulation) for the transportation of produce and other farming goods. They made a lot of money off the farmers as a result.    Also, deflation due to the policy of staying on the "Gold Standard" in which all US dollars were backed by gold bricks made it impossible for them to pay back their debts. They wanted the free unlimited coinage of silver to cause inflation.

Your whatever you wrote does not make sense.  I will attempt to answer to what I understand from your whatever you wrote:  1- Remove the "like" it is unnecessary and incorrect.  2- what students say do not count.  Unless they want to bully you and you let them bully you.  3- Indian politics cannot be dirtier than any other politics.  4- You must be assertive and ask those students to be specific and give you facts, precise examples.  5- Whatever they give you as facts and examples, you have to remove your emotions from the situation: you are not those politicians they speak about.  Nowadays, anyway, we can see that corruption is everywhere!  Not only in India or Asia at large.  6- Corruption is evil.  Yet it is a fact of life and has been all during the past centuries.    7- A positive discussion is the one that looks for answers, solutions.  An example would be (you see that I avoided the word 'like') to ask what can be done against corruption.  8- Why they came for that opinion is not an English question?  Grammatically it makes no sense.  If you mean: how did they come with such an opinion?  then it may very well be that they have a cheap on their shoulder.  This, nowadays, is even more common than corruption.  9- If they have a cheap on their shoulder, nothing will enter their head, so do not lose your time with people who have prejudices.  They are like dead people who walk, eat and look alive, but their mind is dead.  10-  Improve your English.  That is the best way to express yourself in a way that does not ask for bad comments about you, and can defend your opinion much better.  Learn your English grammar!!!

94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	They were at war.  Crete and Cyprus were important Venetian possessions, that Venice needed for trade and commerce.      One of the biggest confrontations between the Turks and Venice was the battle of Lepanto, 1571, when she defeated the Turks with the help of ships from Spain and (I think) the Pope.      Sometimes this is seen as a crucial event in the decline of the Ottoman Turkish empire, but the Turkish response was very quick and decisive.  The Turks were able to rebuild the fleet in record speed, and soon took the island of Cyprus off Venice; an event that serves as the backdrop to Shakespeare's play, Othello.  The loss of Cyprus proved, in the long run, far more important than the naval defeat.

Plus, you'll open yourself to a raft of cruel jokes about him being so dumb he has to be reminded what hs name is while he is having doggy-style sex with you.    Plus, if you start "missing around" with someone who is better looking, or a better speller, he will be reminded of your ex every time he sees it.    Speaking as a guy, if you are willing to have sex with hm on a regular basis and don't nag him about his drinking, he will stay with you until he gets  a better offer. That isn't the same as a love that will last through 50 years of lean times and fat ones, sickness and health, joys and sorrows.

PraEwTolaa	They began to pay more attention to human behaviour and less on religion, painting what was the most real, like the Mona Lisa. Though she is a fictional character it shows their attention to human expression which was the foundation of artists work. From there thy painted or created what they felt adding depth and emotion unlike paintings before that.|`|pDKm9Wmgaa	They began painting in perspective. Before, paintings were flat with no depth to them.|`|kNhpKy1oaa	The Renaissance was fueled by the principles of rational thought and idealism. Mathematics and science played a large role in Renaissance art. Perspective is only one of the ways to show this. It's the rationalization and compartmentalization of space.     Someone has posted above that the goal of the Renaissance was to paint in a naturalistic manner, but this is not entirely true. While paintings during the Renaissance appear more naturalistic to us, they are, in fact, highly idealized. Renaissance artists were drawing inspiration from Classical Antiquity, a period in which human perfection (think perfectly sculpted bodies, etcetera) was highly sought after. You never see flabby figures or genre scenes (scenes from everyday life - truly natural scenes) in the Renaissance. These things become all the rage in the Baroque period.

Ultimately, I think it does more harm than good. The lens flare is so strong, that the color and contrast in face are significantly subdued.    When I look at this picture, I see your friend Alex, but my attention is being pulled away from it because of the sun.    I do like the expression and using the sun was a good idea, you just need to control the lens flare.

yE1VgFhiaa	both....|`|m3rt9x8Caa	modern by far, my first classic was pride and prejudice and it was way to boring and hard to understand it was horrible|`|eBbwb4Kzaa	I prefer modern but read a lot of the classics too from time to time. Pride and Prejudice is one of my favourite books.|`|AA12065466	i read HP too! =]   i guess for me, i lean more towards classics|`|w3uYxwiraa	It depends on the definitions you have of 'modern' and 'classic'.    Modern I like: Eragon, Maximum Ride, Perks of Being a Wallflower, Sabriel, Mob Princess, Discworld    Classic i like: The Picture of Dorian Gray, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Howard's End, A Passage to India, The Arabian Nights, and all Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm fairytales... the list goes on and on.      Some classic is  horrible (Moby Dick, Lord of the Flies,) and some modern is bad too.    By the way: here are some books that could be considered 'modern classics'- Dune, The Lord of the Rings, The Shining, the Princess Bride.    I say these could could be modern classics because they were written circa 1950s to 1970s and  are immensely popular.|`|MlZay5VHaa	I prefer to read classics because I like their general writing style and the language that is used.

It's not because I can't understand the classics, or that I consider them "boring" or anything like that. I don't. The Arabian Nights and Animal Farm are some of my favorite books.    But I just read more "modern" books, and prefer them. I don't agree when someone says that reading a modern book requires less attention. Yes, the English is generally easier to understand, but I've read several very complex and well written modern books.|`|hvJQSUOQaa	Mostly modern stuff like Harry Potter and The Sword Of Truth.  The oldest stuff I read comes from school. I usually don't enjoy it as much.|`|R0iHHPqEaa	modern|`|DjCLWseZaa	I like both, but honestly, modern books are easier for me to read and really get into. This is not because of the modern storyline, it is because of the language. For example, I read The Odyssey twice: once in an old translation and once in a modern translation. I enjoyed the modern translation more. (Archaic English is beautiful, but it distracts me from the story). Story-wise, I love both equally.|`|y3op8rr1aa	both   can't decide  i love classics but i tend to buy books in the romance and young adults, modern.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	i like both|`|tcVYqYYVaa	modern  sometimes the old books r 2 hard 2 understand|`|AA12375660	I like both. But after reading a classic, I usually have to read a modern book because of the easier language. I think that if I were to read a bunch of classics in a row, my head would explode from all the old English!  Good choice on Pride and Prejudice. It was one of my first classics, too.    EDIT: **"non-modern" English|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	I prefer classics, but I read "moderns" way more often.    Classics require devout attention.

Nothing beats a good classic though.|`|ve4K3rb1aa	i like a good mix.    although i have to say that given an ulimatum i would choose classics    i think the world is in a sad state when classics are 'hard to understand'  and 'confusing'  resumably this is because the grammar is correct and they have a plot.  it says alot about our education systems    edit:  chaucer is written in 'old english'  most classics are simply written in 'correct'  english.|`|8NqQvOqQaa	both  modern & classic are amazing|`|UzJBYk5zaa	Classics. I like something with meaning behind it if not just a really good story to get lost in. I read modern stuff, but my heart is in the old. Still some modern writers have won me over, most notably Jasper Fforde, Susanna Clarke and *Gabriel Garcia Marquez*.     I applaud you for at least trying something different, because you never know til you try. P&P takes some getting used to so you may have to stick with it for a while before it gets really good. I always thought the middle of the book lags a bit, but then it's stabilised by one really great chapter :) And of course the ending is sooooo worth it...|`|R3glUmwHaa	I think it all depends on the book.|`|gKnPpVgUaa	Nothing wrong with modern,I love Terry Pratchett.Having said that,classics have stood the test of time so must have something.

I have tried at least 5 times to read one of the book in the series. I have never finished. There are always so many accents, obscure references , and events that are very hard to interpret.To truly understand (for example) a book written in feudal Japan , I would have to read a book on the time period to understand the story better. So to answer you first question , I would say classics because the settings and accents are easier to understand at first and do not need much research or clarification to understand.|`|MTwqyZuRaa	Some modern books are great but i personally think that theres something more addictive about classics...    I mean when i read a classic (e.d. tale of 2 cities or Hunchback of Notredame) i get a real sense of pride that i'm reading and enjoying something that is considered a classic and therefore is considered "timeless"  The stories are more original, the emotions they describe seem more extreme (i.e. in classics someone doesnt just "fancy" someone, they are hopelessly and passionately in love with someone.. dislike is also replaced with a relentless hatred that knows no limits)    In short i prefer classics because they are closer to poetry (and therefore more captivating and beautiful) than anything written today    (Harry potter and twlight are good and all... but ye canny beat the originals!!)|`|3HEcuph9aa	I prefer modern there much more interesting at my age (13) . Many find classics to boring. They can't stand them even in english when we are forced to read them! but sometimes classic are ok but i love reading i find modern stories more interesting!

Oh, and I bet the movie would be sweet, too. YES, IT WILL BE MADE INTO A MOVIE.    3. I'm not entirely sure about that, sorry. Their description does sound compatible in ways, but they might get a bit annoyed at each other at times. You could put that into the story, like, how they overcome it and deal with each other, etc etc.    Good job!|`|iokyiSauaa	it doesn't sound childish  it is very interesting  for romance use subtle inferences describing the characters emotions , keep away from cheesy Dialogue or it will ruin your book.  descriptions are compatible.    sounds like it will work out awesomely. Good luck girl :)
Y0ffbZKraa	Unless the writer created the creature themself, they cannot get a copyright for them. If you wrote a story about dogs, you couldn't decide you want to make it so no one else can write about dogs without your permission. You cannot use that character though (I.E.; Lestat, Buckbeak) of course.    Well your story should be entirely YOURS and leave no room for doubt about copying other authors in the first place. I think when it comes to creatures in general it will only be a problem if the creature is hugely popular at the time. At that point it seems like you don't care about the actual work and are just trying to cash in on the craze. (Yes, even if you've been working on it for the past 14 years or whatever. Life isn't fair.)|`|ve4K3rb1aa	well,  this is tough.     hippogryff you'll get away with because they were frst cerated in the 16 th centuary.    but hobbits were created by jrr tolkien,  and so you woulnd t be able to use those i'm afraid.  but that i smore to do with brand trademarking than copyright issues.|`|e4984fff739610fd75449d66ba5516a1aa	Well you are. Change their appearance and call them something else.|`|UzJBYk5zaa	Hobbits yes, hippogriffs no. Hobbits are the intellectual property of Tolkien enterprises, but a hippogriff is a mythical beast whose concept has been around since who knows when. So, hippogriffs are safe but the hobbits have to go.    However you can always call them halflings as it's not a Tolkien concept and can be used freely.|`|0l98mcf3aa	Listen, sunbeam, if you think that using other people's ideas from their imagination is going to make you a successful author, climb out of your rectum now.  If you believe that any reputable publisher would read past the first few sentences, you're in need of counselling.  I think you should face up to the reality of this highly competitive business and realise that you have to have something ORIGINAL to offer. And you're right, people will think you're merely copying famous authors. Then again, perhaps not, because they won't have the opportunity, because it'll be in the publisher's bin.  I've got to smile at your arrogance. Soon to be an author. Why not say, 'Soon to be a major author'? Have you sold the film rights yet? But then, you don't say you'll be a published author.   I'm lucky enough to be a published author, so I know what the business is like. Come up with original thought, and then write well. Learn the damn craft.  Everybody's a frogging author, these days. Jeez!|`|Kvjy5DE2aa	It may be considered plagiarism if the creatures you use inhibit the same characteristics as other author's, such as personality type, but of course, it would be ridiculous for anyone to assume that they would be able to sue because they used the same creatures.  As long as you don't in fact copy their ideas (not saying you would), of course you can use the creatures as much as you like :)|`|w3uYxwiraa	Hippogriffs are actually Greek mythology, I think, so it's fine to use them. However, hobbit is a term under strict copyright by the Tolkien estate. When the term Hobbit was used in the game Dungeons and Dragons (Balrog was used to, also from LOTR) the makers were sued BIG TIME. You can have creature with the same characteristics, but give new names!

Silk...I think of sheets to go to bed, since you mentioned whispers (like whispering around bedtime cuz the world is sleeping) and "shadow sleepless eyes" also makes me think about bed and sleep. Memories defying the breeze..I'd like to know what that means. I would explain it's memories still there, so the wind won't blow it away and that's the way it defies it, and I LOVE the ending. "As nothing stirs on days like these." It just seems like you have your mind thinking of a lot of things, or just memories, and they're not going away, but it may be keeping you up (sleepless eyes).

e30a9e9e5716e986b609ef9728d116ccaa	I decided to get no more than 10 thumbs down from Twilight fans today, so i'm going to just tell you that some books have a meaning, a message, while Twilight has none(and don't try to tell me it does, even the writer said once in an interview that her books holds no message at all). it's poorly written(if you know literature) but it is a page-turner for some of the teens. the characters are badly designed(but again, you have to read more than 5 books in your life to know it).. so this is my opinion. Twilight fans, go read what you want, just one small bit of advice: after you read it, put it down, and read something else. admire it, love it, but DO read something else.. don't just obsess over it so much. that's just a waste of time.|`|Ox7VS6KHaa	Some people have there own opinions. I actually love the books because the author has beautiful writing, but the movie wasn't my absolute favorite.|`|Bg9NxBG0aa	that's what i thought to. then i decided to have an open mind and read it and I too have become a twilight groupie :( it's embarrassing. I'm still in the closet about it. My taste in books are impeccable so I usually don't admit to liking twilight lol but i really liked the story. cynics will be cynics though|`|xNhNRJrBaa	I thought it was trah to till i actually read it and now i love it!!!! so dont dis it till u try it  :||`|rbjzHWabaa	thats what you think|`|4TX26viFaa	It's aimed at the same market that the romance novels go for, but also include teen girls.    Look at all the Orlando Bloom-Lord of the Rings swooning that went on a few years ago by the same group.      Some people like this stuff, some don't.  I, too, prefer novels with more substance to them.|`|5I9aWZTyaa	you should read it to find out you cant hate something you havent read, how would somebody else know your opinion??|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	Here come the fangirls....|`|whRueN0paa	What answer could you possibly be wanting to get from this? See, everyone has this thing called an opinion. Some people like something. Some people don't. DUHH. I don't like twilight either, but come on, stop acting as if your opinion is the only correct one.|`|GiUTgnHMaa	obviously your just trying to get a lot of answers from people saying, I LOVE TWILIGHT!!! and then youll thumbs down them! we all know your just looking for one answer, the answer that agrees with you. this question should be removed. its not a question.
159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	The Mighty Yamster pointed your question here, though it should have been in Books and Authors.    You might also try asking this in P&G.    Personally, I think John is hiding in the mountains watching human economic liberty being torn asunder. Glad to see someone else in Genealogy has read this masterpiece.|`|avVdKiWKaa	If Atlas shrugged, how am I supposed to know?|`|I1wVybUYaa	with carmen sandiego|`|tCw2VHMNaa	Who's John Gault?
Z0v6G0Kgaa	You are referring to the "personality identification playing cards."  They did not identify the 52 biggest treats or threats to the US.  They only identified Iraqi leaders who were fugitives.    Only 10 of those on the original deck are believed to be at large or unaccounted for.
vryw9udtaa	you could try the host. it was actually good, even if you didn't like twilight. or you could try the uglies series, i've started it and like it. or you could read more sarah dessen books, since you've already read "someone like you", you could try "just listen" and "the truth about forever". i really liked those. another good author is jodi picoult, you could read "my sister's keeper". it's a great book, and it's going to be made into a movie. another suggestion is jane austen classics, like pride and prejudice, if you haven' t read those.|`|hC6zkcHHaa	definitely read    Uglies by Scott Westerfeld.   it is an amazing book.  it's a series.. there are four books.  seriously check it out.|`|UHGQI2p8aa	Blood and Chocolate (about werewolves)  is really good  Im 17 and reading The Sookie Stackhouse series the first one is dead until dark  It is about vampires and is more grown up way better than twilight      Happy Reading*|`|AA12225863	jodi piccult.    best author ever.   i recomend:  my sisters keeper  plain truth  change of heart|`|wyx7W5yRaa	tweak* by nic sheff - it's a story about his drug addiction.    ann brashare has two new books - the summer of you and me; and the other one is about a sisterhood. i forgot what it's called.     tuesday's with morrie* - it's about life in general, like what you should get out of it.     angels & demons    digital fortress    the female brain* - it's nonfiction, but quite interesting.    i don't know any vampire books, sorry. i can't think of any others, but if i do, i'll put them up here. enjoy!    *my favorites.|`|78XM4hQsaa	I know you kind of mentioned not wanted any *squeal! * boy crazy type of books, but just for the humor/ oddball main character, I'd suggest Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging.      For some books with substance, maybe you can try: The Kite Runner, The Namesake, A Clockwork Orange, Lovely Bones, and The curious incident of the dog in the night-time.      For your vampire fix, maybe something from this site will help? http://www.monsterlibrarian.com/vampires...      Hope that helped!    *forgot to add in Wicked and Gregory Maguire's other books. They're pretty good alternative takes on classic fairy tales.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	Scott Westerfeld's books  Maureen Johnson's books  John Green's books|`|QlB3VXWraa	You might like "The Clan of the Cave Bear" by Jean Auel. It's a novel about prehistoric people about 30000 years ago when there were still Neandrathals.|`|mDt03eXIaa	There are no vampires in it, but Angela's Ashes is a really good book. I'm re-reading it right now for like the 3rd time lol. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is another one of those books i keep reading over and over again because it's amazing...1984 is also a book everyone should read, but it's kind of heavy. I had a hard time getting through it. Lol I keep suggesting all these like.. iconic books because i mostly read the "omg hes so hot" chick lit haha.     The Soppy Firsts series is amaaaazing. (sloppy firsts, second helpings, charmed thirds, fourth comings, and there's a 5th one out soon too). I read it for the first time when I was your age, and seriously, it's incredible. It;s about a girl and a boy, but it's not a really goopy, romantic type book. it's very real. and funny, you will laugh.|`|SYKGIiQkaa	Blood and Chocolate    then try The Warrior Heir, The Wizard Heir, and The Dragon Heir. Great trilogy.|`|dsgXLjiUaa	This may be a bit under your level but it is a good book for all ages.   May bird and the ever after. I guarantee you, you won't regret picking up this book. It's extremely good and thrilling. It's not horror but more of an adventurous type of book. Like one that keeps you on the edge of your seat.|`|QI2Q6rgLaa	if you havent already read these I would definately recommend them:    Looking for Alaska- John Green  Paper Towns- John Green  Jellicoe Road- Melina Marchetta  Saving Francesca-Melina Marchetta    They are all all about teenagers and have actual substance (unlike a lot of books these days). They deal with serious problems, not fashion emergencies, and are all hilarious and easy to get into
deUhGccIaa	Because it marked the transition Between the Anglo-Aaxon kings to the Norman kings, which led up to the 100 years war in a way. basically, it is important to know because it drastically changed the way england was run|`|Ne2l5qrEaa	The Battle of Hastings established William the Conqueror (aka William the Bastard) as a strong leader; he ruled England from 1066 until his death in 1087.  He had been promised the Crown, he was denied the Crown, he crossed the English Channel and took the Crown.  It was no accident that he was crowned King of England on Christmas Day 1066.   England was unified under William the Conqueror.  He established a more productive military by building defensive fortifications/castles in strategic locations, required his Lords/Barons to swear an oath of loyalty to him, introduced stronger laws and enforced them, required a census, which enabled him to collect taxes.|`|05anyV31aa	it changed the culture of Britain from an predominant Anglo-Saxon one to a Norman-French culture for the next 500 years|`|CAOisulkaa	becuase the book publishers say so.
gDxMoBl9aa	This may take awhile so Edit.....    What did the US lose?    116,708 Dead 205,690 Wounded    What did the US gain    It's place as a Superpower on the World stage, and a reputation for having an unstoppable Military.    What were the most Important Battles the US fought in?    The Argonne Forest  Showed the Germans the US Army and Marine Corps were deadly fighters. Especially the stand made by The "Lost Battalion"  The Somme  Broke the power of the German Army allowing the final Allied Victory shortly thereafter    *Edit*  Whoever TD'd Me needs to shove it.|`|wEpwWVhJaa	How about giving Khan 10, he couldn't have given you a more comprehensive answer.

xH87SKENaa	Yes, it boring right now, but it gets better the farther you go in, the Blue Bloods series is really good, it just takes a while to get into it.  But they do get better!|`|HnXOEDbcaa	It gets really good, you should really finish it, you barley read that book! You are just in the beginning, it gets way way way better, keep reading it!|`|db66fc70a6a89edc4973a377afc4fb0baa	yeah it gets better. I've read all of them twice and they dragged at first but I knew it got better. There are parts that you probably just want to skip over out of boredom but it is a pretty good series. But i think she's going to end it soon or else everyone is going to get bored by it.|`|CHMEE3h7aa	Man you aren't very far into the book! Man your like what a few chapters in? Yes it gets better just be patient. And the girl that died was her name Aggie? If it is then your so not that far into the book! Just give it some time.|`|Z6CzYRtMaa	It does get better, but its not the best book I've ever read. I got bored at certain parts but I guess they're pretty good.|`|AA10699315	It took me about a month to read the first one, and I have a reputation of pulling all nighters and finishing most books within hours. When I finally got through with it (After literally forcing myself to pick it up every time), I slammed it down and though what an incredible waste of time it was. I found the entire book pretty boring.     However, since I had already ordered the second book, I've started it, and it seems to be slightly more interesting than the last. Let's hope that's a reoccuring theme.
F6FXBXPNaa	Sounds as though you may be directing this energy toward your parents or a significant other.  Basically, what I gathered is that you were pointing a finger at people that JUDGE!  I think it is beautiful and definitely you got your point across!!!  Btw, I write similar poetry that can be found on Literotica.com.  Beautiful and well put!!!|`|UmobeP5Saa	sounds good to me    yeah i get the point|`|rdEKTBqDaa	Amazing Annie! See, u write good poems 2! Mine are all really long. ANd depressing.

pDKm9Wmgaa	That actually looks like watercolors to me. It looks like raw paint was applied to the paper and then mixed and manipulated directly on the paper.   I would not use ANY paint, including watercolors for finger painting. Many paints have heavy metals in them and are extremely toxic, although they are less so now than in the past for safety reasons.   Real finger paints are non toxic because children will eat the paint if the opportunity arises. Many toxic chemicals can be absorbed through the skin.    Edit:  I beg to differ, Lucky. That is watercolor paper - cold pressed texture by the looks of it. I have never seen acrylics 'bloom' like that, where the purple fans out and runs down. However; that is typical for watercolor.|`|J7ByVZ3Aaa	I doubt that is finger paint to due to the thin lines. If it is paper you need to get a heavy weight paper (arches, reeves BFK, canson) to paint on, or just get primed canvas. You would want to get an acrylic paint, or water based. You do not want to have oil paints all over your hands.|`|BWQamocLaa	I doubt that its a finger painting too. It looks more like its made from acrylic. The wide vertical stripes seems to be done by dragging a loaded paint brush over the canvass. The thin purple block of color on the lower right looks like a wash. I don't think it uses paper because I could see here and there a "weave" pattern, more like stretched canvass.    So it seems you need some Artist Acrylic paints, a few feet of fabric canvass, a painting frame, painting palette, brushes and water.    Hope this helps.
5f6c8f16d3b0eff919c4db41f4c72b72aa	I believe in the Big Bang or something similar if that isn't it.  Then evolution with everything.  I do also believe that God exists though, and I guess that means He created the Big Bang but not necessarily humans (I think He sat back and watched what happened afterwards).|`|8HnLYjK4aa	ancient astronauts.|`|5f9hg9craa	We were created by an astronomical phenomenal event right after the Big Bang. First, there were volcanoes everywhere then an icey comet came down and melted to get water. Then germs were in the process of reproducing. Then a big planet smashed into us giving off more germs and made the biggest imprint on the planet which now orbits the Earth (the moon). Then we got of the water and became animals|`|Uj7liSHMaa	I believe that the world was formed by natural forces ie gravity  I also believe that humans evolved from ape-like creatures and that all life on earth evolved from a common ancestor.  I don't believe in god but respect the views and beliefs of others.  I don't see why religion and science can't be in agreement, however i don't see how people can genuinly believe that the world was created in 7 days.
w3uYxwiraa	It's a very good book. I read it a while ago. In the scene at the beginning where Mattie's (or is it Maddie?) Mom tells her that Polly isn't a t work because she's dead, and in the scene when the robbers break into her house, and her grandfather dies.
4sXYcMIBaa	its not out of love its out of vengeance i dont know a quote form the book right now but i know heathcliffs true love is catherine and that isabella is just a way for heathcliff to piss catherine and linton off and avenge himself|`|35770bf8f2d8c67783b3ab4e50bf146caa	Their relationship is profound and in the book, if you read it.|`|74bjAMndaa	there is no relationship. heathcliff merely uses Isabella for his own means & discards her
KyuX0CRaaa	As brilliant as your use of language is, it is over-written. You can use some intricate language, but try to make it understandable. Also, words should be poetic in description, like, "the streets were veiled with darkness." It helps. You have a wide array of language, but when people read something, they don't want one big vocabulary lesson. They want something that is enjoyable to read.|`|RvWmmjWiaa	You've made me learn some new words. That's nice|`|4865uWgkaa	Oh my god!   I'm learning new words!    Yeah, it is quite right. Even if you're thinking about people, sometimes you think of yourself too, even if you don't realize it.|`|ACVWJSVZaa	i think it confuses me.
AA12343309	You do so by tracing your ancestry starting with yourself and working back one generation at a time.  Don't get overly involved in your name.  Your name is a very small part of you.  If you get back to your 6xgreat grandparents, barring any duplicates, you come from 510 individuals.  Of those 510, only 8 of them will have your name unless there was marriage to others with your name.    Get as much info from living family as possible.  Talk to your seniors. Tape them if they will let you.  People who do this say they have gone back and listened to the tape again and hear things they didn't hear the first time around.  They might be confused or wrong on some things.    Find out if any has any old family bibles.  Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates.  Also depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be very useful.    The best website for original source records is Ancestry.Com.  They have all the U.S. censuses through 1930. The 1940 and later are not available to the public yet.  They have immigration, military, land and other records. They have indexes to vital records of many states.    Not all records are online but the ones they have will save you money in traveling to courthouses, libraries, etc all over the country to get the records.    Good genealogy means good documentation.  Be very very careful about family trees on their website or ANY website, free or fee.  They are subscriber submitted, seldom documented and when they are documented, they are usually poorly documented.    You frequently will see different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is accurate. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues as to where to get the documentation.    I recently found out that me, my sister and my brother-in-law were all dead.  Didn't give dates of death but it said we died in New Jersey. The only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey was in 1956 when we drove through with our family coming back from New York.  So be careful!  You might be dead.    Checking further and I found family on both sides that married and died in Newton, Sussex County, New Jersey. Since what ancestry of mine is not southern American colonial came in through southern ports, I was very surprised.  If this information had been sent to any of the websites, it would have been accepted.  If you disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that is between you and the other subscriber.    A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon)Church.  They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons.  In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.     I have never had them to try and convert me or send those handsome young missionaries by to ring my doorbell.  I haven't heard of them doing that to anyone else that has used their resources.    There were lots of Germans in colonial America.  Over the years, they blended in with all the other colonials except those they call Pennsylvania Dutch.  They mostly came from the Rhineland Pfalz and Switzerland.   So you might have a German name but be more English, Scottish or whatever.     Good Luck!|`|gb1BGP8xaa	Don't you have your parents' names?  No grandparents?  If you have your grandparents' name, that is a start.  But if you don't know any ancestor name, you will have a tough time finding any history.|`|Bp6254Vbaa	Try these http://www.web-detective.com or http://www.people-search.com, they provide records of almost everyone.|`|AA11053540	You need to do a paper trail, or have a DNA test done.  Try all these:  You should start by asking all your living relatives about family history. Then, armed with that information, you can go to your public library and check to see if it has a genealogy department. Most do nowadays; also, don't forget to check at community colleges, universities, etc. Our public library has both www.ancestry.com and www.heritagequest.com free for anyone to use (no library card required).  Another place to check out is any of the Mormon's Family History Centers. They allow people to search for their family history (and, NO, they don't try to convert you).  A third option is one of the following websites:  http://www.searchforancestors.com/...     http://www.censusrecords.net/?o_xid=2739...     www dot usgenweb dot com/     www dot census dot gov/     http://www.rootsweb.com/     www dot ukgenweb dot com/     www dot archives dot gov/     http://www.familysearch.org/     http://www.accessgenealogy.com/...     http://www.cyndislist.com/     www dot geni dot com/    Cyndi's has the most links to genealogy websites, whether ship's passenger lists, ancestors from Africa, ancestors from the Philippines, where ever and whatever.    Of course, you may be successful by googling: "john doe, born 1620, plimouth, massachusetts" as an example.    Good luck and have fun!    Check out this article on five great free genealogy websites:    www dot associatedcontent dot com/article...    Then there is the DNA test; if you decide you want to REALLY know where your ancestors came from opt for the DNA test. Besides all the mistakes that officials commonly make, from 10% to 20% of birth certificates list the father wrong; that is, mama was doing the hanky-panky and someone else was the REAL father. That won't show up on the internet or in books; it WILL show up in DNA.  I used www.familytreedna.com which works with the National Geographics Genotype Program.

0qalmlxuaa	First, I would like to introduce myself. I'm Riba, creative writing student at WSU. I wrote my first poem at 9. I'm still an amateur at the age of 19, but I can describe myself as a poet. I see you're putting too much enphasis on the rythmic pattern, so ur losing some quality and some meanings. Poetry is a deal of joy and pain and wonder, with a dash of the dictionary, as Kahlil Gibran describes it. Let ur emotions flow in ur poems, and care less about the ryhmes and the rythim. Emotions are musical by nature, and you ll be surprised by the kinds of rhymes you ll come up with unintentially. Later, at a professional level, you ll be able to make intentional ryhmes without losing any meaning, but for now, stick to the emotional part, just say what you gotta say, and be wild and crazy. Poetry is about being urself. It is about descovering urself in ur written words. Dnt get me wrong this poem was pretty good, but the technicality is taking over the quality in it.|`|xTMjr8MZaa	you must get a copy of  THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE  written by  William Strunk and E.B.White   you will learn much from this small book    Wayne Gore    go to  http://waynes-place.net|`|AbtCfY1caa	one of the first things they teach in workshops is to drop the rhyme pattern, if it must, work with interior rhyme.  next thing is, words that  name emotion are not real and should not be used.  a concrete image should be used in every line and with these images you may convey the emotion of the poem.  thats a start.|`|KyuX0CRaaa	It is beautiful and enlightening. It also gives you a good image. Reading this I can picture a little boy bursting into laughter, an old man in a hospital bed, a dumped woman.   It is absolutely perfect in the way that it is, as you wanted, like a story in a poem. It just skips the physical description and concentrates on the emotion. And the emotion is very well expressed.
rP6k9WLuaa	Um. Well, it's a nice friendship poem. You are pretty successful at rhyming, although you know you don't have to rhyme. You have too many syllables in each line, or, like the other Answerer said, your words per line don't flow. Try reading the first two lines, and then try keeping that same flow in your mind, and maybe you'll see how it's hard to do. When that happens, the reader gets distracted and it sounds off in their head. It sounds a bit wordy too."Alone you are no more" can be like, "you are no longer alone" and "in silent times it never rhyme" well, I don't understand that line. It should be "rhymes" though. But the message is nice, it really is.|`|AA11333096	In my own opinion, the first stanza was kind of boring. The lack of enthusiasm really weakens the point of the poem.    This poem is supposed to be influential, helping those who do not understand the concept of friendship to understand it.    Other than the first stanza, it was alright.    Did I get the concept down? Or did I totally miss your point?|`|HrFqImzUaa	It made me smile.    Personally, though, I think that you should watch your rhythm. The mood is wonderful, but the scrambled rhythm makes it difficult to read. If you want a good example of rhythm and flow, I suggest reading "The Ballad of the Reading Gaol" by Oscar Wilde. It has a much darker message, but flows exquisitely.    KF

rP6k9WLuaa	It's good. You have a good flow to it, your rhymes allow it to flow. My critique is just that the last line, well, if only a real man could conquer you, then why did he? He's def. not a real man he's a jerk! But I guess you can say that that's why he should feel accompplished. But it's good..  :)|`|7pfCkrCzaa	I like it, except I don't think real men conquer chicks?

ceBTTCPwaa	The Once and Future King is an Arthurian fantasy novel written by T. H. White. It was first published in 1958 and is mostly a composite of earlier works.    The title comes from the supposed inscription of the marker over King Arthur's grave: HIC IACET ARTORIUS REX QUONDAM REXQVE FUTURUS  "Here lies Arthur, the once and future king."    http://www.bookrags.com/The_Once_and_Fut...    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/ofk/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/futureking...    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...
pw8FX7ANaa	I wrote a story like that one time. It was a comedy where everyone was some kind of mythical creature (goths were vampires, jocks are werewolves, etc.) i based the characters on real people and it was sort of about my life but more dramatic and i added stuff to make it interesting.|`|f78e049a0a721f2547dc02fbb6ae7403aa	My suggestion is to write about things you know about.  Base fiction on things you or your friends have lived through.  If you can make the characters really interesting and realistic enough, then plot doesn't matter as much.  Base characters (loosely) on people you know - and they will pop off the page.    Good luck!
pbZywicUaa	The Mambo dance originated in Cuba where there were substantial settlements of Haitians. In the back country of Haiti, the "Mambo" is a voodoo priestess, who serves the villagers as counselor, healer, exorcist, soothsayer, spiritual advisor, and organizer of public entertainment. However, there is not a folk dance in Haiti called the "Mambo."  The fusion of Swing and Cuban music produced this fascinating rhythm and in turn created a new sensational dance. The Mambo could not have been conceived earlier since up to that time, the Cuban and American Jazz were still not wedded. The "Mambo" dance is attributed to Perez Prado who introduced it at La Tropicana night-club in Havana in 1943. Since then other Latin American band leaders such as Tito Rodriquez, Pupi Campo, Tito Puente, Machito and Xavier Cugat have achieved styles of their own and furthered the Mambo craze.    Hope this helps|`|djhCah5Maa	Cuba?  Watch the movie the Mambo Kings.  It might help with your project.
AA12058653	This is what I shoot with for lighting:    http://www.photobasics.net/details.cfm?i...    It's actually inexpensive in comparison to pro lighting, and it does a much better job than those ebay setups. It also includes an educational DVD as well as a grey backdrop to get you started...    I got my backdrops from target, just simple king-sized flat sheets. The white is REALLY hard to photograph and make it look white - I have to iron the heck out of it so no wrinkles show up, and then photoshop it in every shot or else it looks muddy/gray in some areas. The black works really well, and my sister got me a deep red and a light blue color that work well also. I hang all these at once on a very sturdy curtain rod that's just a tiny bit wider than one sheet stretched out. That way a change in backround is as quick and easy as opening a curtain - I usually clip mine in place for less wrinkles.     The downside with king size sheets is that they aren't long enough to do a full body shot - you'll end up with either the ground showing at the bottom or the wall at the top, but they work fantastic for head and shoulder or knee to head shots. I use a simple bar stool or piano bench for my clients to sit on, and ta-da! That's my studio, cost about $600 for lights and backdrops.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	for 300 bux you can get lights and backdrops on ebay... they are cheap lights, but they are great lights for learning studio photography and they come with accessories.  T-shirt material sheet sets from places like target make great backdrops, so do the flannel ones.  Get the king size set it's 20 dollars and comes in various colors.

6sjphNcPaa	If your parents never told you, how did you find out?    Seriously, there is a huge difference between a "father" & "mother" and a "dad" & a "mom." I had a dad & a mom growing up. It doesn't really matter who the "sperm donor" was.    However, I wish that they had told me but it really doesn't matter.|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	I am not adopted but have one thing to say. My dear friend was adopted, and her brother, both their adoptive parents died before they were 30. Marian searched for her birth parents partly to do with the deaths of her "real" parents. She searched for years, her brother did not want to and just left it. Eventually my friend found her Mother and that she was the result of rape. Can you imagine how she felt? She had had a fantasy about her past, but then came the reality. Question - How much did this help her with her past?  I know that you should love the ones who love you. What else really matters?|`|AA11053540	I think I would be relieved to find out I am NOT related to those people who now are my relatives.|`|SBKQkprMaa	I would be upset that they didn't tell me (don't know how you found out) as they should be honest with you at the appropriate age. But....I would not be angry as they had the love in their heart to make me their child.|`|gb1BGP8xaa	If you aren't adopted, why are you asking this question in Genealogy?    People come here looking for help looking for ancestors, so we assumed you were adopted and never knew and now were looking for biological parents.    Do you have a real genealogy question?|`|2PDBxlYDaa	Honestly. I wouldn't really care that much. As long as I had two parents who  loved me then there is no need to be weird about it. I would be curious as to why my parents had given me up but I wouldn't seek them out. There's more to being a parent than giving life to a person. Its about raising them and being there for them. I would consider my adopted parents, my true parents.    Luckily, I knew my real parents, my mom is still alive and we have a good relationship. I've never been one of those people who was caught up with nationality and genealogy. To me that doesn't define a person. I define who I am and by how I live my life.

YwdFUCQtaa	Go back to the original question: 'At what point is a photo Art?' Answer: at the time it's printed or displayed, with or without manipulation. Photography has long been included in the Arts, because it fulfils the generally-accepted criteria for inclusion. That is an argument that was settled long ago. The question is therefore redundant. A more interesting and valid investigation would be: 'At what level of manipulation or alteration does photography become Graphic Art or some other art form?' Perhaps you would do better to pursue that line of questioning.|`|GOLGzmt8aa	Whens a photo not a photo?  when you leave the lens cap on  If you don't put in the card  or when your PC crashes and you loss the stuff you have no back up for|`|HlQCmCG0aa	Just some thought.  Why can't a 'photo' be 'ART' ?    I try to do both.|`|n4KoinUpaa	Disclaimer: These are merely my opinions    I'll tell you what a photo is not: A picture composed of many separate elements from many different photographs combined onto a single image in an artistic way. That's a collage, but many people seem to forget that.  You can paint onto a printed photo, although then it becomes pop art to some.  Editing should be minimal to retain the scene that was shot, or as the photographer planned the shot (Within realistic limitations, eg, burning or dodging of the sky, contrast adjustments, etc)      However, photography IS in art. If literature is, so is photography.   Keep in mind, only opinions from someone who could be considered stuck up about what is and isn't a photo

I'm answering this for the curious, not for your grades:    Aristotle is somewhat condescendingly showing off his pedantic nature by stating that he does right acts because he knows they're right whereas other people do them because they think they have to.  More directly, he's saying he does moral actions because they're moral, not because he thinks god is going to punish him.  As a different example, he obeys the laws of society because he realizes a society can only function with active participants whereas other people obey laws because they fear punishment.    Summary:  Aristotle "Smart people will do what's right because they realize why it's right, dumb people do the right thing because they think they have to."|`|HrsPCzaBaa	I think it's rather low of you to continuously ask questions for the sole purpose of others doing your home work for you.

These are name artists and the works should be valued.  You can do some preliminary research for a small fee ($29.50 for one month access) by using AskArt.com site which lists artists, biographical information and auction selling prices. Or Artnet.com which lists paintings, galleries, auction houses, etc.   Whatever you do, get reputable representation and don't do something like put them on ebay without knowing their market value.  Look at the links I provided for additional information.    http://www.askart.com/askart/artist.aspx...  http://www.askart.com/AskART/help/indivi...  http://www.artnet.com/ag/fulltextsearch....  link for Bonhams&Butterfields auctioneers and appraisers - this page has detailed information about appraisals and selling at auction  http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/public.sh...    DO NOT list them publicly where anyone can get this information -  these can be valuable works and it would be risky posting this information on an open public forum.

caA4NSF2aa	Inexperienced guitarists (i see it ALL the time on Yahoo Answers) love to tout learning scales as a magic bullet for becoming a musician.    Now, scales are an important piece of the musical puzzle... but they are by no means the end.    What you need is not to simply learn scales, but to learn music itself. Music theory.  Learning scales will be part of learning music, but there's a lot more.    A good music teacher (specializing in guitar) will be your best route. If you're already taking lessons, you need to immediately quit and find a new teacher.  Any good instructor is a music teacher first, and a guitar instructor second.    If you're not in lessons because it's cost-prohibitive, or even if you do take lessons and want to supplement your learning... here's a couple books to get you started (links are free from referral codes, and that garbage):    Musician's Institute's "Fretboard Workbook" - this is an absolute must. Buy it now. For real: http://www.amazon.com/Guitar-Fretboard-W...    Hal Leonard's "Music Theory for Guitarists" - This is a good book to get you started with music theory (in addition to, and alongside the fretboard workbook).  There are other music theory books that are just as good, or maybe even better... but i can vouch for this one.   http://www.amazon.com/Music-Theory-Guita...    But in short - yes scales will help, but not on their own. You need to understand music itself in order to know what will sound good.  And with the fretboard workbook you'll also become intimately familiar with the guitar, and learn how to translate the sound in your head into your playing.
AA10162167	For one I think he used house paint...buy a few buckets....don't use too many colors stick to 3 or 4.      Here is a link where they discuss his technique in detail.|`|HUDjXVOyaa	He used oil paints aswell and played with consistency by adding various amounts of paint thinner. He would even leave paint outside during winter to allow the paint to get thicker due to the cold temperature, so when he dripped it onto the canvas it would run slow and thick.     He also incorporated colored string into his work as well.   I had the chance to see a few of his paintings in a Museum down in Texas. It was the experience of a life time, some of his canvases stretch a long as foot-ball fields. Not literally, but that is how they felt. The man was a true master.    The biographical film they made of him was a great movie too.
spYpsixUaa	Whenever management is replaced in a given Project-based environment, the persistent belief is that management was replaced because everything being done was wrong.  Within such a perspective, most newly arriving managers take it upon themselves to replace everything.    "Legacy" means pre-existing.  You say that they reported that the Sperry Gyroscope Sonar System "could" be substituted?  Any management perspective would look at a Legacy system as something that would be better replaced than adapted to, so it's almost a given that they would want to replace it.  Consequently, the Replacement Sonar System was what was late.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	I am still searching in some or the other philosophical books.|`|cxDbdhELaa	Actually, it couldn't have been delivered on time.

The earth has been invaded by a species that take over the minds of their human hosts while leaving their bodies intact, and most of humanity has succumbed.    Wanderer, the invading "soul" who has been given Melanie's body, knew about the challenges of living inside a human: the overwhelming emotions, the too vivid memories. But there was one difficulty Wanderer didn't expect: the former tenant of her body refusing to relinquish possession of her mind.    Melanie fills Wanderer's thoughts with visions of the man Melanie loves-Jared, a human who still lives in hiding. Unable to separate herself from her body's desires, Wanderer yearns for a man she's never met. As outside forces make Wanderer and Melanie unwilling allies, they set off to search for the man they both love.    Featuring what may be the first love triangle involving only two bodies, THE HOST is a riveting and unforgettable novel that will bring a vast new readership to one of the most compelling writers of our time.|`|ve4K3rb1aa	what is the search bar there for?    i just loveddddddd the way that you didn't bother reading the terms and conditions when you signed up.|`|QgiTgc6paa	It's kind of strange it's about alien kinda bug things taking over human bodies which are their 'Hosts' and it's basically a love/sci-fi book.|`|97yOYOIdaa	"Melanie Stryder refuses to fade away.

OZe8yHk5aa	I think it is because people are short-sighted in general, and they cannot, or do not want, to look at issues in the long term. As you mentioned, the economy is one good example. Even with Obama's new stimulus plan, the economy is still in trouble. It is a short term fix that doesn't deal with the massive US debt. Another example is the environment and climate change. Rather than accepting that there is a problem, people prefer to focus on their own immediate needs and wants.<br>  <br>  This problem is compounded in democracies. Because most people are short-sighted, politicians must pose short term solutions to get elected. If one candidate says that the country must make some hard sacrifices, then they will almost certainly lose to the politician who tells people they can have their cake and eat it too. This is a problem that can be resolved only if great leaders make their way into power. Otherwise, society will fail to address long term problems, and doom itself in the process.

LA2nJToYaa	Ok your first step in finding your roots is to go about things orally. Since your grandparents are dead try to find any living realtives you can. Your grandparents im sure had brothers and sisters ask your parents who these people are and try to find a phone number for them. If that don't work, work with older uncles and aunts and cousins. Write down all the names you get your prioity should be getting the names of your greatgrandparents. Use those names to start the deep digging. You need to go to the library or the courthouse your great grandparents were born in if you can and get into public records. You need to find birth records, death records, and marriage records. If it is impossible to do this take a name of the oldest relative you know and do a simple Google search and see what comes up OR you can subscribe to Ancestry.com and like sites to help on your journey. <br>  <br>  I myself am Irish and I have traced my roots back to the 18th century however I did it all orally from my great grandparents who was alive at the time. <br>  <br>  Eventually you will get so far in American records it may be near impossible to get records from Africa if your ancestors were slaves. <br>  <br>  However I wish you the best of luck and finding out where you came from can really lead you to know who you are.|`|AiK6YTnaaa	Remember one thing about researching your ancestry, virtually all of us are not one ethnicity. Depending on when your ancestors arrived here can effect how difficult is will be to answered your question. We tend to use our fathers surname to track our ethnic background but remember (as you are finding out) that your ancestors were not always from the same ethnic background. My 5th great-grandfather (the one who has my surname) arrived here from Ireland in 1733. At the 5th great-grandparent level there are 128 people you draw your ethnic background from. Start with your parents(2), grandparents (4), great-grandparents(8), etc. As an African American you will most likely run into more difficulty in finding records documenting what other ethnic groups you belong to. There has been a lot of effort made in the last few years in finding and publishing records for those with an African American background. Good luck in your search!!

Such a new and righteous vision of morality will attract all that is good in the mind of man and challenge that which is best in the human soul.

Emotions are not based on wisdom but we can transcend this state and come to a point where we can practice loving kindness and compassion for all sentient beings.  If we can't love without discrimination, then we don't know love.  When you approach someone on the street it is either with like, dislike or indifference.  It is this attitude of judgment which stops us from really understanding what love is.  Once we learn to love everyone and everything without that judgment then we are starting to practice wisdom.  Actually it's much deeper than the samsaric view that 'love is great', 'love is kind' and that sort of thing.

The only man capable of experiencing a profound romantic love is the man driven by passion for his work -- because love is an expression of self-esteem, of the deepest values in a man's or a woman's character. One falls in love with the person who shares these values. If a man has no clearly defined values, and no moral character, he is not able to appreciate another person. In this respect, I would like to quote from The Fountainhead, in which the hero utters a line that has often been quoted by readers: "To say 'I love you' one must know first how to say the 'I.'"<br>  <br>  Chopra sees love as without clearly defined values, and no moral character.<br>  <br>  "PLAYBOY: You hold that one's own happiness is the highest end, and that self-sacrifice is immoral.

QusqTXCaaa	The English Civil War cemented the supremacy of Parliament, and ended the Monarchs claim to rule by divine right.<br>  <br>  From the English civil war, until the Regency, the monarch was still the single most powerful individual in English politics, but they were no longer powerful enough to defy Parliament without causing a constitutional crisis.<br>  <br>  It is ironic that the English Civil War probably helped to preserve the Monarchy in Britain.  After our experience as a republic under Oliver Cromwell, we invited the exiled Charles II back.  <br>  <br>  Absolutism was defeated in Britain, and that meant monarchs could not ignore the will of the people.

bLnjJ6Cbaa	I've done that before, more than once :) The first time I was in 7th grade. I hadn't bought a yearbook (everyone signs yearbooks, right?) and I wanted to have something for my friends to sign, for memories. So I bought a blank white book, decorated the cover and the inside pages, and hade my friends sign it and write comments. I still have it, actually. But that was just on the last day of the school year.    When I was out of the US, I found that the girls in school in the country I was in did something similar. Sometime near the end of the year, maybe a month in advance, they'd each buy a really nice lined notebook with an elaborate cover. Inside it, they might decorate it or they'd have one of their more artistic friends do it for them. Or, alternatively, they'd buy journals. There was a small bookstore (well, more like a supply/gift store) in front of the school that sold beautiful hardcover journals with colored stationary-like pages. Then, for that last month of school, all of us would exchange these books (they were just called memory books) and write letters and jokes to each other, or draw pictures, maybe throw in a poem or a quote somewhere. I really enjoyed doing that, especially with my friends. One year, I remember drawing pictures for all of my friends in their books. My friend and I wrote to each other in a code she came up with, and we signed our names as characters from a soccer cartoon. They were just great reminders of the fun we had with each other for those two years. Sadly, I couldn't bring mine back with me when we returned to the US. You've just reminded me of how much I miss my friends. I don't think I'll ever see them again :(|`|TPpTAKAdaa	I've never heard of them being called "posie books" but I've heard of the same general principle in friendship journals.|`|ZhsPSqW9aa	No, I haven't...

1hvrQYWiaa	In simple overview terms,the feudal system involved individual nobles,knights and landowners pledged allegiance to the king in return for recognition of the ownership of their land.This allegiance included having to provide military service,a certain number of men depending on the wealth/amount of land an individual owned.This military service was only 40 days a year,however.This meant medieval armies were a hotchpotch of irregular,often untrained and differently equipped soldiers that would disband after 40 days,making it difficult for kings to assemble large armies for long enough to achieve long lasting results.   The Hundred Years War (which actually lasted from 1336 - 1457) called for something better,so the English developed a system of direct contract between the King and any knight or noble who had the influence,wealth or ability to raise a force of given size for foreign operations - these contracted forces were thus under military control of the king rather than their feudal overlord.   In 1445 the ordonnance reforms in France established regular paid military units directly in the service of the king.So,both England and France developed effective standing armies controlled by the monarch.This was due to the fact that the war lasted so long and the kings needed soldiers for more than 40 days a year.Now,the kings could use these standing armies to enforce the royal will throughout the realm,rather than relying on the influence of powerful local nobles in the regions;this weakened the feudal bond between people and their local lord,and they began to identify more with their kings and began to see themselves more as Frenchmen or Englishmen than just vassals of their local lord.These trends helped kings centralize,and thus increase the powers of the state at the expense of feudal lords.

3cEqH3pfaa	Spain provided Carthage with three very important resources -namely men, weapons and silver. The Carthaginians recruited warriors to join their armies (and many of the troops who went with Hannibal came from Spain), and most of the soldiers (especially the light and heavy infantry and skirmishers) Carthage used in Spain were local Spanish tribesmen. Spain was famous for its iron and produced enormous quantities of fine weapons to equip Carthaginian armies. The Romans later had their own weapons made in Spain as these Spanish weapons were superior to those made in Italy. Finally the Iberian peninsula (now Spain and Portugal) was noted to have some of the largest and richest deposits of silver in the ancient world. Silver was used by both sides to pay their soldiers (and support the economy generally). The loss of these three severely damaged Carthage and hastened its defeat.  As far as the conquest of Spain by the Romans,during the 2nd Punic War and especially by Scipio Africanus, see several sites on the web eg www.crystalinks.com/punicwars.html  and various databases (which should be able to access through your local library).
NYU37jfGaa	Ancient Egypt had a highly stratified society, they would have viewed their society as a sort of pyramid I suppose, with the Pharoah (king) at the top, and the peasants, who farmed the land and did the heavy building work etc, at the bottom, the base of society.  The peasants apparently worked on the building of the pyramids when they were no engaged in agricultural labour.  However, by the time the monuments in the Valley of the Kings etc came to be built, it seems they had full-time workmen engaged in the building work, they built villages for them to live in.  By that time, the building of monuments would have become a full-time occupation.    The Pharoah was considered to be semi-divine, a sort of incarnation of the gods on earth.  His job was to preserve and restore the original harmony of the universe, and his divine birth was much stressed.  Each king was a mixture of the divine and the mortal, the living King being linked with the god Horus, and the dead kings with the god of the underworld, Osiris.

AA10015648	The best way to start, is to give your ideas and events structure. Beginning, Middle, End. It sounds so simple, but there are key parts to each that makes a good story and makes people connect to the story.    The beginning is for introducing characters. There is usually some kind of conflict right off the bat, but that conflict is just so that readers don't get bored. The conflict is meant to introduce your main character or characters. Show how they react to conflict, show what kind of people they are, show how their lives are so that when the BIG CHANGE happens, we, as readers, know what the character is 'used' to in life.    The big change is when the main character has passed a threshold that prevents them from going back to their normal life. Their child is kidnapped, they witness a murder, they're sent back in time, they learn that magic exists... the character MUST take action, because they have no choice but to move forward.     If your character can still leave the situation without dire consequences, then the change isn't big enough. If your character witnesses a murder, but nobody knows your character saw it, and your character can report the murder without any consequences, there's no reason for the character to try to solve the murder on their own. Now, if your character is a criminal, then that's one reason that keeps them from going to the cops - or if he does tell the cops, maybe he becomes the prime suspect... THEN he's in it for the long haul, until everything gets straightened out.    Everything in the middle is working towards the end. At first, it's just a vague goal... find out this clue, learn this fact, get help from this person... each step will take your character closer to the goal, but each step can have trials and difficulties on its own. Dorothy getting to the wizard isn't the main goal, it's just one step towards the ULTIMATE goal of getting home, but it's a very difficult step.    Once your character is equipped to face the final challenge, you're in the "end" - your character doesn't need to know anything else to face the big problem. Harry Potter has gone into the trap door, has passed all the booby traps, and is walking by himself down to where the Sorcerer's Stone has been hidden. Even during the end, your character can find out more information, but the act in facing the foe, in confronting the enemy, in righting the wrong, in getting back home, your character has no choice but to succeed or die trying.    Then, there's the wind-down. Your character is either back to their old life or has changed so much that they're ready to establish a totally different life.     If you've got ideas for a story, then see if you've got all 3 parts... at the very beginning is your character already stuck in the situation they're trying to escape? If so, you're starting your story too late - That'd be like starting Wizard of Oz when Dorothy first goes to Oz. We don't understand why she wants to go home so much because we don't see her family or her life before Oz.     Once you've got the general idea of the structure, you can start writing your book anywhere along the line! You can start WRITING about dorothy first going into oz, because you know you will go back and make a life for her to go back to. Or, you can write the ending, if you've got a great idea for how you want the book to end. Once you've got the structure, you're free to write ANYWHERE along the story line, because you'll know where the story begins and where it ends, and a general idea of all the things in between.    Best of luck!|`|SSmM05guaa	Trust me, it really is. I always get this problem, which is why my stories' beginnings are always weak.
OjQxKGC0aa	Anne Frank was an amazing writer for one so young. She is a voice for the 1.5 million innocent children who were killed in the Holocaust, a reminder that we must never forget the evil men can do.|`|w8JxOiLMaa	I feel like Anne Frank's diary is okay, but I believe that it is overrated because of readers' sympathy for Anne, which, in evaluation, switches the reader's focus from literary merit of the book to its poignancy.
PoJLz2fhaa	Well there was the dining saloon itself, but on A deck in first class there were 3 big public rooms, the smoking room, the lounge and the reading/writing room. The lounge was considered a gender neutral room for everybody and couples, the smoking room was on all ships generally considered the man's retreat, while the reading/writing room on the Titanic was specifically designed to be a place for women to gather.
6vryp5a3aa	Anyone who says it's a horrible book, is not into the whole Twilight Saga. Eclipse was personally my 2nd favorite - but my favorite was Breaking Dawn. YOU NEED TO READ ECLIPSE TO FINISH THE SAGA. If you don't you really won't get anything in Breaking Dawn. I personally didn't love New Moon, so if you liked it - you should really love Eclipse. I wouldn't buy it, unless you love love love the saga & plan to read it over & over, just get it at your library.|`|1EDRfx3haa	it's pretty good yeah you should read it if you like the other twilight books?|`|EzmuhKRkaa	NO.    ...but you should read it if you are going to read Breaking Dawn.|`|AH2U33enaa	yes it is good, and if you don't read it you will get SO confused!|`|WiXhwyInaa	In my opinion, if you like Twilight and New Moon, you'll love Eclipse. I can't tell you the best part, because that would ruin the book.|`|9rekPBIdaa	Eclipse in my opinion is the best book in the Twilight saga. My favorite part in Eclipse is the Chapter called Monster. In that chapter Edward and Jacob sorta become friends and it is pretty funny. :)  Dont listen to those friends plz listen to me!  Buy Eclipse!   I promise you will thank me! :)|`|jUVqXdCoaa	Eclipse is an alright book. Most people like twilight because they like Edward. Most people like New Moon because there is Jacob and Most people like Breaking Dawn because there is Edward and Jacob but in Eclipse you really don't know who she is going to choose. yeah you have that gut feeling There is going to be Edward but then there's also Jacob! I wouldn't say it's the best i mean New Moon is the worst in my opinion.So i suggest that you buy it and just read it, check it out, see if you like it. It's not my favorite but it is very interesting. it's not as romantic as the others it has a LOT more action but JUST TRY IT OUT!|`|78TTQWP9aa	I really liked it.  I think it was the best out of the entire series.|`|yVsuERSFaa	it was a flower in a pile of ****. the twilight epic (a epic fail) is the **** and eclipse is relatively the 'best' 'book' (more like fanfiction). in the series, but it sucks too|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	Bad Book|`|Q49d8oD1aa	In my opinion Eclipse is just as bad as the rest of the series (no offence)    but if you actually like the series, that you will like Eclipse...(just don't buy Breaking Dawn, worse than all the others combined...)|`|EQaGQ6hWaa	IT IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!  dont listen to your friends im a hardcore twilight fan and for me the firt and the last book are the best...you have to read  the best part is that renesme and jacob get together|`|QYoIVno5aa	It depends on what you like to read. I think if you liked the first and second book you will like this one! On the other hand if you don't like them you will most likly not like this one.|`|nEhDpDMVaa	I think eclipse is the best book of the series. It really cements bella and edwards relationship together. I LOVE IT!|`|w3yrnDEiaa	no it's terrible|`|MBm4ieNkaa	It's very poorly written, and I've read all of the books, so I'm not just saying that.|`|SSfOeCOXaa	i couldn't really tell you the best part because it would spoil it... but it is pretty good i guess.  my favorite in the series is Twilight though.|`|24nXuHrPaa	it is an atrocious sack of crap that calls itself a good book...if you buy it,but it only to throw it into a river....yeah go buy it just for that|`|47GdgGKIaa	it's ok, but not the best in the series. i like twilight in the twilight saga the best. it depends on your interests. i like it. well, then again, i am an obsessed twilight freak so who am i to tell anyone? lmao, well i like it and I would take it out of a public library first, or borrow it from a friend, and then if you like it, then go and buy it. =]

yOK32PM9aa	I don't think any of them do. Einstein was a scientist, in a very narrow field at that.  His views on other issues were avidly sought when he became the first media-age "genius", but none of them are particularly compelling.  Lots of the quotes by him that we hear are not by him at all.  (The latest one is about the demise of the honey-bee.  Absolutely untrue!).  A towering genius of science, but wisdom in the human race is widely dispersed and we should not expect any more of him.|`|AA11705909	Just because he was a good theoretical physicist does not mean he was an expert in humanity and philosophy.

eU9uZLZwaa	"Inaccurate" would be an apt term, lol, but how much would vary from paper to paper. The modern equivalent of those papers would be something like the ol' Weekly World News or the National Enquirer. There may have been a factual story at the middle of an article but things were often spruced up for the reader's benefit. Instead of standard National Enquirer references like "..says a pal" or "said his/her friends", people cited in the story would sometimes be described as "a person on whose word we can rely" or "whose word is beyond reproach" as these folks were often people you'd never heard of.  For the most part, papers tried to outdo each other in the scoops, even if it meant adding things to the story.  This is the time of "yellow journalism", where accuracy wasn't a prerequisite & increasing sales was important above all else.
yOK32PM9aa	Yes it can.  Although metals are very diverse (mercury is a liquid at room temperature, for example) many of the metals that we see and touch around us in everyday life have certain characteristics in common.  So if something were very hard and unyielding, smooth, and cool, we could call it metallic to the touch.  It would not be a particularly specific or vivid metaphor, though, as the same could be said of some stone or even wood.|`|YmtNel5haa	I think so.<br>  metal objects feel "metallic."|`|VNBJoC89aa	Yes. Because most metals has a higher specific heat than other elements, they draw heat away from you body more quickly than other materials, causing them to feel cold to the touch. This, combined with the fact that metal is usually smooth and hard, can tell you if something "feels metallic". However, other materials, like glass or marble, may mimic this effect.|`|kTc3bfrRaa	cut a  piece of alluminum sheet..   what do you feel?...

mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  This is an extremely good book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.    Other books I've heard were good and planning to read is Need by Carrie Jones, Evernight by Claudia Gray, Lament by Maggie Stiefvater, Beastley by Alex Flinn, Old Magic by Marianne Curley, Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin, the Blue is for Nightmares series by Laurie Stolarz, and Evermore by Alyson Noel (coming out in February)    I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too. So yeah.. you should check it out|`|5I9aWZTyaa	Searchbar, i see this 348975278954 times a day.|`|AA10251347	The President's Daughter series by Ellen Emerson White are excellent!!!|`|kv2sMwfoaa	The Bard Academy Series by Cara Lockwood    Look on   http://www.bardacademy.com|`|qkeygXBRaa	o0 well.. depends how old u r if ur 13 or older read the georgia nicolson series and/or read first helpings(thats the first book)|`|EB6Bjf0paa	Its in a series called Maxium Ride.

So... I guess his age depends on whether or not his statuses as "living" and "undead" are a factor.  If you only count the time he was alive as the time he aged, then he's 17 years old.  If you count his mortal life and his immortal life, he's 107 years old.|`|nEhDpDMVaa	Edward was born June 20, 1901, He was changed at age of 17 though so he will be 17 all his life.

You then pealed the two apart with one having a paper neg on it the the other a nice positive.<br>  <br>  As I Googled both here I found very little anymore available to the "amateur" at large.<br>  <br>  However, in the past, some cameras were as big as wagons and in fact WERE the wagons and could do single shots 4x5 feet and more.

The title of the book is "Birthday Letters" and the poem is titled:    Red  __________  red was your colour.  if not red, then white. but red  was what you wrapped around you.  blood-red. was it blood?  was it red-ochre, for warming the dead?  haematite to make immortal  the precious heirloom bones, the family bones.    when you had your way finally  our room was red. a judgement chamber.  shut casket for gems. the carpet of blood  patterned with darkenings, congealments.  the curtains - ruby corduroy blood,  sheer blood-falls from ceiling to floor.  the cushions the same. the same  raw carmine along the window-seat.  a throbbing cell. aztec alter - temple.    only the bookshelves escaped into whiteness.    and outside the window  poppies thin and wrinkle-frail  as the skin on blood,  salvias, that your father named you after,  like blood lobbing from a gash,  and roses, the hearts last gouts.  catastrophic, arterial, doomed.    your velvet long full skirt, a swathe of blood,  a lavish burgundy.  your lips a dipped, deep crimson.

AA10303012	Anti Jewish sentiment proliferated in Germany after they lost in WW1.    The Germans had to pay the victorious allies reparations after the war, which caused financial meltdown in Germany.  While many Germans were suffering, the Jews were viewed upon as the wealthy class, probably because they were educated and were shrewd businessmen.  While you are poor and have nothing to eat, it would have been easy to blame those who had plenty.  When Hitler came to power, he blamed the Jews for most of Germany's woes, and most of the populace went along with that sentiment.  Not that most Germans wanted to see the Jews exterminated, but they didnt strongly object when their relocation program went into effect.

7e5abc454682d801da33c90ddf12aaddaa	Does the following descrition fit?  If it does then yes there is a Perfect Game book.      "In the pews of San Juan Bautista Church, Angel Macias and a ragtag band of street urchins of Monterrey, Mexico's slums try to escape the dismal conditions that surround them. Hunger, dirt floors and cinder block houses--life holds anything but promise for these forsaken children.   But there is one ray of light. After Mass on Sundays, their priest gathers them around an old radio where they listen to crackling broadcasts of the far away Brooklyn Dodgers.     One day, Angel finds an old baseball in an abandoned dirt lot and begins to throw the ball against the wall of a dilapidated shack, only to awaken a factory worker named Cesar Faz. Angel goads the gruff man into a game of catch. He soon discovers that when Cesar was a twelve year-old growing up in Texas, he was a batboy for the San Antonio Missions, and later worked for the St. Louis Browns.     A chance encounter with the Mexico City All-Star traveling team inspires Angel and his friends to form an organized Little League team. Their dream: to dress up in actual uniforms and play just one "real game" in the United States. But first they must convince Cesar to coach them.     Averaging thirty-five pounds lighter and six inches shorter than their American counterparts, the boys journey to Texas for the first round of the 1957 Little League Tournament. Dragging their reluctant coach with them, they cross the Rio Grande on foot and walk twelve miles through scorching desert to the field in McAllen, Texas--each boy wearing his uniform and carrying nothing more than a change of underwear in a paper bag.     With a three-day visa and barely enough money to last that long, they whisper their prayers and start what they assume will be their first and last game. But a different destiny awaits them...     Based on a true story, The Perfect Game is a timeless and astonishing tale of faith and the human spirit's ability to overcome all adversity in pursuit of a dream."    Try this link:    http://www.bookfinder4u.com/IsbnSearch.a...    if you scroll down you will find a list of bookseller to buy the book from.  It is also a very good site to search for other books on.
245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	I love this book to death.    But did you read it?    Edit: This can help you- http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secretbees...
Q49d8oD1aa	read The Fallen series by Thomas E. Sniegoski...  it's about angels
f4Nn0W1xaa	There are a lot of ways to look at that statement, whether one agrees with it or not. Personally I believe that a work of literature is a work of literature even if no one ever reads it. The word literature is not synonymous with the word classic, after all, and a piece with literary merit has that no matter what.    For the sake of argument though, you could state that once an author is dead the only thing that keeps his work alive is the reader. In that case the reader is the vehicle that carries the work through the years and has therefore become as important as the writer was at the start.    Or you could say that a book is only what is made of it by its interpreter. I can certainly never be sure that I took from a book what its author intended me to. I can only know what that book said to me. If that is not what the author set out to say that may be through no fault of either his or mine. Certainly his intent does not invalidate my interpretation or any lesson I may learn.     That matter of interpretation can, however, result in some unfortunate circumstances. For example, many people read only certain words in Huck Finn and determine from those terms that the book is inherently racist. Seeing the text in that way prevents those readers from finding the true point of the book. So, that reader, with that blindspot, is as important as the writer because they will never see the work as it was intended and will never absorb what they might have otherwise.    Certainly, our knowledge and ability as readers is greatly enhanced by what we know. If we have no familiarity with the Bible, or Shakespeare, or, for that matter, many, many other works in the literary canon, our understanding of a great number of modern works is going to be hugely compromised.     One seemingly simple allusion can indicate a world of information that the author meant to convey with its use. A reader who doesn't understand that allusion may still enjoy the book and value it, but they may not have not fully grasped the author's purpose. So that writer needs a reader who can read not just what he said, but also what he meant to say.    I'm not sure if this answered your question for you, but thank you for asking it, it was very interesting to answer!|`|MSEyXHFWaa	The reader is as important as the writer because without the reader, literature would never be read.    Do you think that the ear is as important as the sound wave when it comes to hearing?    You need both parts to make anything worth listening/reading. You cannot directly compare the roles of the creator of the stimulus to the recipient of it.     Apples and oranges.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	Who said that?  I don't believe that- though without readers to motivate a writer, then we would probably be without many novels/books/stories at this point in History.  Though writers should be capable to writing without the knowledge that it could possibly fall into the hands of a reader, who is very judgemental.      In society, without the reader, the writer would have wasted all that time created such a beautiful piece.|`|3OUeAuLyaa	Because frankly, when you get down to it, without the reader, the writer wouldn't have a career.    That being said, the reader also is the one interpreting the writer's words. He or she is the one who makes the work of literature their own, picturing the characters and settings in their mind. Without the reader, the writer's work means very little except to themselves.|`|J8xRVPulaa	It depends who you are talking about, doesn't it?  To the writer, the reader isn't nearly as important.  But to the reader, many of them the author isn't very important.  It's all perspective.    EDIT: the career "writer" might not exist, but i very seriously doubt people would stop writing, just because they don't have an audience. I know i certainly wouldn't.|`|wEpwWVhJaa	Revenue, is the pragmatic answer. But interpretation is the key. Once a piece of literature, indeed any art form, leaves its creator, it becomes open to interpretation, regardless of its intention. That's what makes it art. If a work defies debate then it becomes moot.
245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	Well, they exist on page, but they're actually "alive" in our heads. I think that's what it means.|`|WMNbGsoWaa	The way a character looks, maybe. We all know how it feels when we see our favorite book become a movie and when we see an actor who is playing your favorite character you'll be like "That looks nothing like the character! Why'd they pick him?" or maybe even "Perfect, that's exactly how I imagine that character!"    It just all has to do with the fact that each reader sees the things in a book differently.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	Characters can't exist- only through our imaginations.  For example, I could create a character from my imagination- and that character can exist to a reader, and to a director- and that character can come to life on the screen, and exist to those who watch films.  But that character physically cannot exist.  However, there is one condition: fiction.  Those characters are based on real people- so, they've already lived a real life, and have existed.|`|E8Xsx11Xaa	Words are just words. Letters put together meaning nothing, look at lost languages. No one spoke them, so they are gone. But! When carefully constructed into a story, they become an outlet for the the human mind. They give us a way to say what we feel. In the end, a book is just bound paper. It's what you see and feel when you read it that makes it a story. No matter how alike two people are they will never imagine a character of a book exactly like the other person does. That version of the character will never exist outside that person's mind. A story is what you make it, nothing else. That's what it means.
f4Nn0W1xaa	Sometimes I wonder what the difference is, to be honest. The relationship is almost easier to determine. Fiction is simply one person's view of reality. I read a set of short stories once where a group of people were all given the same prompt and each wrote a story. Very few of them had anything at all in common except that setup.    I've gone to parties with people and then gone home and discussed the party with them. We were both in the same place all night, surrounded by the same people, supposedly seeing and hearing the same things, but to hear us tell it in the afterglow only a few things line up. Sometimes we even saw and heard the exact same thing but read its implications entirely differently. Who's to say which is fiction and which reality?    If you've ever read Tim O'Brien, (The Things They Carried is a classic example, but you'll find this in all his work, to one degree or another), you'll have a literary experience of the exploration of the idea of reality versus perception. O'Brien does a brilliant job of illustrating how a story changes through the experiences of the individuals in question. If you really want to have your question answered O'Brien is the first place you should turn.    When I write I can write in a lot of different ways, but at the heart of it it's all me and how I see things. I can argue a side I disagree with, I may even be able to do that convincingly, but to get there I still have to filter it through my own point of view. I will never tell that story quite the way someone who believed in that perspective would.    Fiction for me is not an escape at all. It is, rather, a prism that allows me a window into the worlds of many minds other than my own. Fiction brings me realities I might never have been aware of and, done well, allows me to empathize, even with things which I objectively despise. I've learned as much about reality from fiction as I have from reality itself.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	Fiction should be an escape from reality but should keep it in mind.

The common plan or conspiracy contemplated and came to embrace as typical and systematic means, and the defendants determined upon and committed, Crimes against Humanity, both within Germany and within occupied territories, including murder, extermination, enslavement deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against civilian populations before and during the war, and persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds, in execution of the plan for preparing and prosecuting aggressive or illegal wars, many of such acts and persecutions being violations of the domestic laws of the countries where perpetrated.|`|kZT828wJaa	He was the head of state within the Third Reich.

It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.|`|ae24FseFaa	twilight, i think everyones gonna say that so your best bet is twilight, lol|`|fCxuvmJXaa	the best book ive ever read is the perks of being a wallflower by stephen chbosky. and ive read a lot of books. i would deffffff recommend this book!|`|A73ForyRaa	Bottled Up or Twelve they're not series but they're really good books =)|`|o01ikU7kaa	Ken Follet     Pillars of the Earth    awesome story|`|AA10699315	Ashes (Book One in the Gray Area Series) by Stefanie Ellis:    Sidney Fox was your average seventeen-year old girl. She looked like everyone else, dressed like everyone else, harbored hopes and dreams...you guessed it, just like everyone else.    After a long and uneventful winter break, Sidney returned to the stale hallways and cranky teachers to find a new addition: a mysterious new student named Cael, he seemed to immediately fall into the role of the most popular person to ever step foot on campus. At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, its just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is. Cael knows what he is, but he has no idea how or why. Their search for answers sends them across the world and forces them to go to extreme measures in order to get those answers.    City of Dreams (non-vampire related romance) by Stefanie Ellis:    Skyler Ashford is a confused, over-analyzing twenty-five year old. She escapes a small town and bad relationship, winding up in New York City. She hopes to start over fresh and become someone new. Instead, she stumbles across a man. A man she hasnt seen since high school, a man who always held her heart. However, things have changed for him, hes become a world renowned figure in the world of entertainment. Skyler wonders how much fame has altered the man she once loved, and shes determined to find out.

i8vpe2g7aa	I really liked Half Moon Investigations even though it is aimed at a younger audience than Artemis Fowl. Artemis Fowl is much better than Half Moon Investigations and if you like Harry Potter then I think that you'll like Artemis Fowl too. The series does focus a lot on crime and investigation with the eponymous character being a young criminal mastermind and I think that they've got a little drama in them too. I think that they're basically crime novels for teenagers with supernatural elements and humour. If you can, it's always best to borrow a copy from your school or local library before spending your money on a book you're not sure about.|`|mqdkcHDFaa	Haha, I am about your age and I love Artemis Fowl!  :)  I do know that AF is more geared towards older kids than Half Moon Investigations, as is Airman and The Wish List.  I've read all of the AF, Airman, and The Wish List and I've found that his writing style is refreshingly wry and easy to get into.  And hey, the first AF is a paperback, so surely it isn't too much $$$ to spend.  :)  I'd give it a shot.|`|Q49d8oD1aa	I LOVED the series, but, if you are not sure weather you want to spend your money on the series, borrow the first book from the library, then, if you decide that you like the series, then buy the books...|`|welQ5nSqaa	I have the whole series and I love it.

The only problem is they get a bit preachy, especially that last one. I eventually gave up and returned it to the Library.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	One of the things he seems to be reacting to in some of his writings is the assertion by some of his contemporaries that "all theology is anthropology". So he draws a line to distinguish human thinking from inhuman thinking. And the distinctive feature of inhuman thinking is that humans can't do it (perhaps that goes without saying).<br>  <br>  What humans CAN do is to think of things that they know, and compare concepts that they don't know to those things that they do. Thus humans can easily imagine someone with the strength of a hundred men, or a man with a bird's head instead of a human head. These are RELATIVE differences. Our understanding of them flows from other things we understand.<br>  <br>  Kierkegaard, however, thought there was a whole class of knowledge that was beyond this. These concepts were not IMPOSSIBLE (like a man that's not a man) but just completely beyond human thinking and comparison (like a man who is a god). No amount of comparison can furnish a human mind with an actual picture of the infinite, or of perfection, and so on. The difference between these kinds of knowledge and the world we are familiar with are not relative, they are ABSOLUTE.  Nothing like anything we know or can know.<br>  <br>  And perhaps that's the best way to understand the difference between the two in Kierkegaard's writings. If you can compare it to anything accurately, it's a relative difference. If you cannot, then it's an absolute one.<br>  <br>  The same extends to equality. When humans talk about equality, they are usually referring to some mundane approximation of equality: equal voting rights, equal chances, equal time. Again, these are relative things. Absolute equality is a kind of equality the likes of which we have never seen... a sort of INFINITE equality.<br>  <br>  In religion, this characteristic is often referred to as 'immanence' - the idea that the Divine can be found wherever one looks. Omnipresence on every level.<br>  <br>  Kierkegaard seems to think that humans trying to resolve the paradox presented in absolute difference usually do so with an understanding of absolute equality. In other words, one cannot directly understand the Divine, but one can directly understand the world; if the world IS the Divine, then thereby can one indirectly understand the Divine.<br>  <br>  Which is still kind of confusing... but that's about the best I can do to untangle things.

aiCo1l5Naa	Hey I asked the same question a few days ago and since then I did some investigating, the Polynesians were at that time of the beginning of Japan- in Southeast Asia according to most. "One" of the polynesian expansions happened around 6000 years ago, the beginning of Japan dates to about the Jomon culture which is about 15000 years ago, and before that they theorize that the Ainu were among the first people there until the Malayo-Polynesian or people or children of the Sun came- probably named so for the tanning and sun Cultures. Genetics show Samoans closer to East Asians which is where the Tang Dynasty begins and the Japanese roots, in fact all of Asia has a connection to Southeast Asia, it's very interesting.<br>  If you look at the video <br>  Ray Sefo vs Kim Min Soo you can see the likeness but not until you<br>  actually take the time to study the features and ethnography.<br>  its at <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONuRmVJru20" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONuRmVJru...</a> for now or just look up Ray Sefo vs Kim Min Soo fight. <br>  I wonder if that means Polynesians had relation to the Samurai,<br>  There has been studies with the Javanese Islands and The Japanese Islands with Javanese using a sword called the Keris blade, made in a similar fashion of folded steel and sword making. <br>  it goes well with Genetics and other Culture relations.

shVgCizBaa	Why has Incan civilization been described as totalitarian?Why did the Incan politcal structure prove very vulnerable to European conquest?"If the leader was captured or killed,the way it was structured the rest would collapse,there will be no other leader to unite the country against the ennemy .-------The empire was split by a ritual war to decide who would be Inca Hanan and who would be Inca Hurin, which pitted the brothers Huascar and Atahualpa against each other. Additionally, unrest among newly conquered territories, and smallpox, spreading from Central America, had considerably weakened the empire.In 1533, Spanish invaders led by Francisco Pizarro took advantage of this situation and conquered much of the existing Inca territory.[Politics and governance<br>  The Inca Empire was separated into four sections together known as 'Ttahuantin-suyu' or "land of the four sections" each ruled by a governor or viceroy called 'Apu-cuna' under the leadership on the central 'Sapa Inca'. Cuzco was the central capital of the Inca Empire from which where the Sapa Inca ruled from. According to the oral traditions of the Inca the empire was ruled by 14 kings in succession. The earliest kings are likely either local leaders of ayllus around Cuzco or possibly mythical figures.<br>  <br>  The term 'ayllu' refers to a grouping of indigenous people of South America and has been translated as clan.[4] The term represents a group based on assumed blood-ties which operates as an economic and social unit. The Inca Empire was essentially several Andean ayllus controlled by a few Inca ayllus. As an economic unit the ayllu represented collective ownership of the land as well as other resources such as llama herds and water sources. The success and cohesiveness of the Andean ayllus was largely attributed to communal agriculture. Ayllus could regularly split apart because of economic hardships, ignoring blood ties, or come together with other ayllus with whom they did not share genealogy for the purposes necessary co-operation such as in irrigation or defence.<br>  <br>  Despite regular conquering or grouping of ayllus, the individual ayllu would remain intact even after a break up of the group or empire to which it had belonged. This was largely because of their economic self-sufficiency. However conquering ayllus like the Inca, by building the collective state, gained economic and political power and developed into the ruling class, but in doing so they lost that self-sufficiency. This meant that the failure or defeat of the collective state meant the demise of the ruling class.<br>  <br>  The Inca ayllus were based in Cuzco, the empire's capital, which was divided into Hanan-Cuzco (upper Cuzco) and Hurin-Cuzco (lower Cuzco). This separation, common with Andean ayllus is known as dual divisions. The two halves of the ayllu would from separate customs and rites and would form separate units in the army but would remain on good terms with each other socially, taking part in feasts and mock battles. Dual division was mostly religious and symbolic but had little economic relevance.[5] When a ruler died, their chosen successor would receive all their political power and rights, while the ruler's other male descendants received all the monetary treasures.

c046b4c1d98fb68d46a85470e830b708aa	Ok, you're close to my age, so I'm going to recommend the series that I am reading right now, which I absolutely love.    The author is Shanna Swendson, and there are four books in the series so far: "Enchanted, Inc", "Once Upon Stilettos", "Damsel Under Stress", and "Don't Hex With Texas".     It's not vampires, but it does have magic/fantasy, some humorous situations, and romance as well. It's set in NY, and the main character is in her 20's. Check out the reviews on amazon, they are pretty positive, which is well deserved. :)    I'm really enjoying the series, I haven't read books this good in a long time. I don't know what your "content" standards are, but I'll just mention that there is some mild language, and a few mild innuendos through-out. I would probably put it on par with a mild pg-13 movie.    Good luck, and be sure to check this series out on Amazon. They are going to make a movie out of the first one! :)|`|DjircW6waa	There's a series by Scott Westerfeld you might like:  Pretties, Uglies and Specials.  If you need a good laugh, try the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich.  The first one is called "One for the money."|`|w3yrnDEiaa	The Green Mile by Steven King|`|bM9Y79wHaa	The Maximum Ride series by James Patterson  1.The Angel Experiment  2.School's out forever  3.Saving the world and other extreme sports  4.Final warning  More to come!!!!!  They are Y/A.... But very funny, and very good|`|mRQ5SqySaa	I'd say vampire diaries is a really good book,the house of night series and my favorite is the eragon series by christopher paolini it's way different and by far better then the movie that's the one recommend the most.|`|v5QMMZ6raa	Well... the movie looks great, but the confession of shopaholic books are sooo cute! And they are easy reads!    Also, don't forget to read The Host. It's not as good at her Twilight series, but definitely a must-read if you liked twilight!    And try Philipa Greggory. She wrote The Other Boleyn, but I think all of her novels are addicting. I've only read her history-turned-fiction, but there are alot of them. I would try these first! Hope you enjoy!

KY50cbYMaa	I can't get you the chapter summaries, but here's the plot summary.  Maybe it will help:    Massie Block believes her life is perfect and she is the queen of everything until her father's college friend (Jay Lyons) moves into their guest house with his family (wife, Judi, son, Todd, and daughter, Claire). Her father, William Block, allows them to live there while they are searching for a new home. The Lyons move all the way from Orlando, Florida, to Westchester, New York. Because they arrive on the same day as the "spa day" that Massie and her friends were planning on going to, Massie's mother makes her stay home to meet and greet them. When Claire and Massie meet, Massie is consistently rude to her because Claire was just a typical girl who didn't have designer clothes and wasn't rich. She was clearly not clique material, despite Claire's failing attempts to become friends with Massie.    The next day is the first day of seventh grade for Claire, Massie, and the rest of the Pretty Committee (Massie's friends which are Alicia [the gorgeous one], Dylan [the one that thinks she needs to lose weight], and then Kristen [the super smart one]. Massie always drives her friends to school with them, and Claire is dumped in the backseat. While she is in the back, Claire endures first being ignored, then being made fun of by Massie and her friends.    The school day doesn't get much better when Alicia intentionally dumps red paint on Claire's pants during art class forcing Claire to go to the lost & found where she befriends the school nurse. The others (Alicia, Dylan, and Kristen) are mean to her because Massie doesn't like her, so they all treat her cruelly. One day Claire gets so fed up with them that she sneaks into Massie's room every day when she's walking her dog Bean and pretends to be Massie on IM. This way she convinces Alicia that Massie thinks Claire is cool, Dylan that Massie thinks she (Dylan) is too fat, and gets Kristen to confess that she's poor after saying that Massie really hangs out with LBR (Loser Beyond Repair) Layne Abeley because she thinks her older brother Chris Abeley is hot. Later Massie uncovers the truth and gets Claire to confess to some embarrassing things she said about the girls in a five-way phone-call. By the end of the book, Massie's alpha status is restored.

Aetr4vamaa	YOU ARE BOTH RIGHT!    (and you are both wrong)  It depends if you are talking about paint pigment colors, or light colors.    It is confusing. There is mixed LIGHT to get new colors and mixed PIGMENTS to get new colors.    PAINT COLORS:  If you mix red and blue paint you get violet. If you mix blue and yellow you get green. If you mix red and yellow you get orange . You can't mix red, blue yellow, white or black form other combinations of paint colors.    PIGMENTS: Look at the ben day dots on a printed page or poster. You'll see red, blue and yellow dots. (Printers call them magenta, cyan and yellow.) With those colors of pigment you can mix all the colors, except for true white and black.     LIGHT COLORS:  In light white is the presence of all colors, while black is the absence of light.  In white light is the presence of all colors. like your friend says in a rainbow.  A red cape actually absorbs all the colors but red, and reflects red.  If you mix all the paints you can get a very, very dark grey or very, very dark brown that for all intents looks black, but you can't mix the actual, pure color black from other colors. You have to have black paint to get the color black. You can't mix white paint from other colors of pigment either.    If you mix all the colors of lights you get white light. Next time you are at a theater look at the stage lights. You'll see red, green and blue lights. By mixing those colors you can get all the other colors. If you can see the tiny dots of your CRT screen you wull  see that they are Red, Blue and Green.|`|mTPRzkBaaa	Yes, in science terms. When speaking about light, not paint and other things of that nature.|`|645f18865ac05bd21df6fca545da961daa	you are comparing light against pigments,     light is all colours of spectrum as in the rainbow, and other frequencies,     white is the absence of use of colour in water painting, keeping paper as a white neutral,    black without adding white pigment to paints would become more so black, any lighter pigments will cause mud coloration,   ..|`|i5hio2Anaa	no, its the other way around.  white is all colors.  black is the absence of all colors.

CoS Ron gets really upset when Draco calls Hermione a mudblood, and he gets jealous that she has a crush on lockhart     PoA Ron and Hermione continue to bicker with each other about stuff that doesn't matter.    GoF Ron gets really really jealous when Hermione goes to the ball with Krum.    OotP Ron gets jealous every time Hermione talks about Krum. They also fight a lot over stupid stuff.    HBP Ron starts dating Lavender to make Hermione jealous and it work because she was really upset about it. Hermione cries on Ron's shoulder at Dumbledore's funeral.|`|BCQuXhRnaa	Hermione gets all angry and jealous when Ron starts going out with Lavender Brown in the sixth book, the Half-Blood Prince.     Read Page 625 on the Deathly Hallows for more..:)|`|vMjbeQyFaa	Kate & Rhbe are correct but they both forgot about PoA when Hermione & Ron sort of held hands when Hagrid introduced Buckbeak to the class and when Hermione turned to Ron for comfort when they thought Buckbeak was executed before she & Harry went back in time to save Sirius and Buckbeak.|`|AA10691319	it really doesnt come to prominance untill ron makes the quidditch team and starts with lavender, hermione starts brooding around, its also hinted at in GoF when ron asks hermione to the yule ball as a sort of last resort which turns and upsets her.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	There are hints in most of the books.  The most obvious one I remember is in GoF where Krum asks Hermione to the Yule Ball and Ron acts very jealous. He even destroys his  Krum action figure because now that the Quiddich star is interested in Hermione, Ron no longer is a fan who adores Krum.  He wanted to ask Hermione to the Ball but was too slow and then he lashes back at Hermione because he's confused about his feelings towards her.    Also in HBP, when Ron dates Lavender, Hermione is very jealous. And it also feels as if Ron is only dating Lavender to make Hermione jealous.|`|1a0cdf84b10327b2e35d799092f75617aa	um, i guess just them pretending 2 hate each other was a clue. thats how lil kids flirt. i mean in like the SS CoS PoA GoF|`|DjCLWseZaa	Just the way they teased each other, the way they got jealous of others spending time with one another, the way they cared for each other and worried about each other. Sorry, Harmony shippers, you never had a chance.|`|yZD0f5tzaa	Their fighting and bickering in the early books are foreshadowing that they like each other. Also in the 7th book, I remember reading something along the lines of, "Harry awoke the next morning, he looked over at the couch were Hermione was sleeping, Ron was on the floor next to the couch, their hands only inches from each other, it seemed as though they were holding hands." Those aren't the exact words but it was something along the lines of that.

5u0kWLgzaa	yeah it is because its comparing to different objects without using like or as.    i think it means that spring brings out his playful side|`|ynS9RQFTaa	A metaphor is saying something is something else.  (Not really a comparison, but whatever).  Like he had nerves of steel,  Which actually means that he literally had nerves made of steel.  But of course it is not meant in a literal sense, so therefore, it is a metaphor.    Your line is Spring is the mischief in me,  Technically, a literal meaning, that makes it a metaphor.  xx    http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|20AlHJ47aa	yep metaphor.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Yes, a metaphor compares two things that are different in nature without the usual comparative words such as "like" or "as".  A simile uses "like" to compare two things...example:    Simile= "I'm like a bird..." (Nellie Fratata song)  Metaphor= "I am a bird"    In both of these, there is a comparison to a bird, but a metaphor doesn't use the word "like" or "as".    I'm not 100% certain what this line means, but to me it means that spring brings out the childlike nature of Robert.  He sees the newness that spring brings through childlike "impish" eyes...    Sorry I can't be of more help.  I've read a lot of Robert Frost, but don't think I've read this work, and it's easier for me to decipher when I have the whole piece in front of me.|`|nxIBhZoHaa	ok a metaphor is comparing to seemingly unlike things without using like or as other wise it would be a similie. the line is a metaphor and it means the the spring is the mischef within the narrator.|`|kxMxhuW2aa	yes. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor
1hvrQYWiaa	WW1 began in August 1914 when Germany invaded neutral Belgium.  The 2 sides were British Empire,France,Russia,Italy(1915) USA (1916) known collectively as the Allies,against Germany,Austria Hungary and Turkey,known collectively as the Central Powers.   The German plan,known as The Schlieffen Plan,called for an attack on France through neutral Belgium to defeat France in 6 weeks;the Germans could then move their army to the east to face the Russians.   However,the attack on Belgium brought Britain into the war against Germany and the Schlieffen Plan failed.By the beginning of 1915,both sides had constructed trench lines stretching from the Swiss border to the sea,and the war bogged down into a stalemate,trench warfare.Attempts by both sides failed to break through - battles at Verdun and The Somme (1916) and the Nivelle Offensive and Passchendaele (1917) only resulted in huge casualties for little or no gain.   On the Eastern Front,a Russian offensive in Poland was defeated at Tannenberg (1914).By 1917,the Russians were so close to defeat that the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia brought Lenin to power,and Russia dropped out of the war.The Germans then moved all there forces over to the Western Front in an attempt to win the war in 1918 (the Ludendorf Offensives).However,this was stopped by the British,and with help from American forces a final offensive saw the collapse of the German army and the end of the war on 11 November 1918.   On other,less important fronts the Allies attempted to knock Turkey out of the war in the Gallipoli campaign (1915-1916) and there was fighting along the Austria - Italy border.However,these fronts also quickly became bogged down in trench warfare.   At sea,there was one major fleet engagement between Britain and Germany at Jutland,in the North Sea (1916) and the German attempt to starve Britain into surrender through the use of unrestricted submarine warfare.   Ultimately,the Germans lost because a naval blockade by the British navy starved them into surrender - the effects of industrialization on warfare had not been foreseen by the combatants,so final victory in land warfare was not possible without external factors (such as the naval blockade) a--effecting a nation's capacity to wage war.   In WW1,more men were killed more quickly for less gain in ground than at any other time in History.|`|8rzM3k7caa	Can you do your own homework and quit expecting others to do it for you?|`|HnqedumSaa	google wikipedia|`|N8UKu0WUaa	- in 1914 a bad bosnian serbian person assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand    - since people in Europe are imperialistic, militaristic, nationalistic and have split alliances, this assassination is "the final straw"    - England, France, Canada, and Russia declare war on Austria-Hungary, Germany and Italy (and vice versa)    - so, they fight...... and fight..... for a long time    - they fight in HORRID conditions. it's cold, noisy, wet, and muddy.    - they fight using trench warfare    - Airplanes, U-boats (submarines) tanks, toxic gas, and machine guns are all used in battle for the first time    - in 1915, after a German U-boat sinks an american cruise ship, America enters the war    - in 1918 a cease fire is agreed upon (end of war)    - the treaty of Versailles is written (which is a factor that led to WW2)

C1NYtzCraa	Well usually for me at least you have to pay for however much the book costs in the first place. It typically says on the inside cover or back of the book.|`|pqHkoHJhaa	The book will most likely need to be replaced.  If it is a new book, the cost would most likely be the full amount.  If it is older it may be cheaper.  This off course depends on your local library.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	I obviously can't speak for every town's library, but at my local library, they base the price of the fine on whether or not the book will need replaced or if it can be rebound...sometimes, a library will just tape the book back together if need be, and give a small fine.      Buying a new book will require that the library find the book's price and that's what they will charge you, if it's a fairly new book.  What you might do, as a way of making amends is to look online and see if you can find the book somewhere like Barnes and Noble and buy it there, then take both books to the library, explain what happened, and see if they will accept the replacement.  Or, you can take it in and ask what the fine will be.    You have to remember that, whatever the fine, you have to take care of it.  You took responsibility for the book when you borrowed it, and you left it somewhere for your dogs to chew up, so you can't complain if the fine is large.  You would be upset if someone borrowed something from you and damaged it, right?|`|AA12095483	That depends on your library. Is the book damaged beyond repair? Ask your librarian - that's the only way to find out what is the policy in your library|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	It depends on the library's policy regarding damaged books.  My house flooded a few months back and damaged some library books. I had to pay the cost it would cost to replace the books. But I did get to keep the damaged ones, so I guess that's something.
w2qV8WEmaa	According to Scientific study, scientist discovered that women will become smarter after they have become a mother. This is due to evolution need for the mother to protect their young so that it could increase the young chances for survival.    Men and women are almost equal intelligences but the hormone of girls are very unstable so it make them do more stupid stuff.    However, pregnancy will affect their hormone and make them more stable. So they will become smarter. In some cases, smarter than the men they married. That is why some women regret marrying their husband and want a divorce. Men also discovered that their wives are harder to please after their first child was born.|`|tUxI10Teaa	it depends if you mean smart, like book-smart, or wise in a real life situation  and personally, i think it's unrelated to sex, but instead related to a person's entire being...long explnation don't feel like typing hope i get best answer anyway|`|AA11891423	that is also y man r stronger than women.|`|phjQGyDYaa	Men are genetically superior to women when it comes to IQ and physical strength.     Women live longer and can give birth.|`|VvyJ1yRUaa	i'd have to personally disagree cause to me men only seem smarter cause we live in a sexist world where men are chosen above women    although miss south carolina did make us seem stupid...    lol xD have a nice day and God Bless You|`|fYwrSBB0aa	They don't want an education.|`|YNd65b3kaa	You almost have to answer with a generalization, so I'll say that considering that since women as a class have always been suppressed in everything including education, I think they're currently making greater strides than men and will soon go ahead just on sheer guts and being so-o-o  co-o-o-l considering how often they face staggering odds.      I remember seeing the television clip of a female Naval aviator veering off her approach to the carrier and ejecting too late as her body was slammed fatally into the sea.  I thought that her approach to the ship was faulty followed by an excessively long reaction to her plight.  But who knows?  At least finally women are getting their chance to succeed in traditional male pursuits.    We have been seeing Moslem women a lot lately on TV, in mountain villages and in downtown Cairo.  What a contrast  to those given opportunity to break away from their cultural bonds even though they are breaking some archaic Moslem law.   But truly, they have been so incredibly patient and tolerant of their life-long sujugation and mistreatment over the centuries that  I think if the roles were reversed Moslem men long ago would  have risked death to overthrow the Moslem clerics who rule the theocracy with an iron Koran.|`|v1BK73Ryaa	I kinda agree with the men are from Mars, women are from Venus perspective and also the, women are objectified and not much is expected from them perspective.    It's a mix of both, but I think women have 2 things going against them that make their lives more difficult then men.    1) Women have their menstrual cycle and hormones to deal with, which seriously hampers their judgment.  Women are much more emotional and sometimes that makes them seem less smart    2) Society projects a lot of expectations on women to be subservient to men such that they feel the need to suppress their intelligent thoughts.    I'd say men and women are both equally capable in their potential but because of society and their biological limitations most of the time women confuse things beyond neccesity and it leaves them looking quite inferior.    As advice to you I would say be your own person and do things the way you want.  I don't think becoming a super independent women means being a feminist by any means, it simply means you don't feel the need to prove yourself to a man or society.  You live your life freely, and that is actually incredibly attractive.  Second of all see your emotional side when making decisions, and understand that emotions confuse things incredibly such that you make your choices as if you were on some kind of drug.    Men who have the same problems often end up looking dumber than their more clear headed counterparts!|`|HrsPCzaBaa	You cant judge intelligence based on generalizations.   Have you met every 'average female'?  Have you proven this statement by personally seeking out every human on earth or atleat a "majority"?   No, i don't think you have.|`|rzHVqhCyaa	No, men really aren't that much smarter. It's just that women are taught that it's social acceptable to act stupid and giggle a lot, therefore they do. Women are positively reinforced by acting like bimbos because it gets them more attention. When guys say stupid **** without thinking they get criticized more heavily.|`|YmtNel5haa	I feel like your statements are counter intuitive.  They just feel wrong.  Do you have any reliable info to back up this claim.  I am not trying to offend you, but I am curious.  Are you sure it is just not the people around you?http://www.trumpuniversity.com/blog/post...|`|8msce8KPaa	women are more emotional creatures, whereas men are more grounded in reason. emotions are, by their very nature, illogical and sway easily.|`|eCaLnoSiaa	Society tells females to let the male be successful while us women relax in their lap of luxury. I wonder why. We are sex objects, not intelligence machines.    However, its a tie because men are not getting off easy either. Studies show that men are more likely to hold onto early adulthood and party like its college... long after the kegs have gone dry. The media doesn't portray men well either.    So.... I think all in all nobody wins. Its all by circumstance who you meet. Take it case by case.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	You may think this but it is not true. My wife of 51 years and I realized some time back that Woman being from Venus and Man from Mars have different ways of thinking about things and we need each other to make sense of the whole life struggle. Men and women need each other in their next life and spiritual as well as in their mortal careers. The differences in viewpoint between male and female persist even beyond the first life and throughout the local and superuniverse ascensions. And even in Havona, the pilgrims who were once men and women will still be aiding each other in the Paradise ascent.|`|6AqdyWgzaa	That is because women are fundamentally inferior to men in every way. It's a physioI can't keep this up any longer. THEY'RE NOT! There may be societal pressures or emotional interests affecting the conclusions of your analysis such as: In a society where male bias is so deeply  engrained in our thinking the woman's perspective is undermined. The platform is set to accept and reward male achievements more readily than those of a female. The standards of what is important is determined by a predominantly male contingent and therefore what is important to a woman would not fit that standard. There are endless ways in which our culture favors and rewards the male more readily.    Personally, as one who doesn't buy into male gender bias, I feel women in general have the upper hand in terms of common sense, wisdom, circumspection, observation skills, and intuitiveness. It's a matter of whats important to you. Women don't usually start wars. And war is one of the most despicable and infantile atrocities in which humans indulge. So I disagree.

In my field we are always advised to use our own names if we start to design  or open a studio.  I'm a decorative artist.    I think this would hold true for photographers as well.  I know many many famous or well know jewelry stores go by the original owners name.  Even funeral homes for that matter.    All the photography studios that stick in my mind have the owners name as part of the title.     If Nightwater is your last name you could use Nightwater Photogray Studio.  Or just Nightwater Studios.  Or The Gordan Nightwater Studio  Yes I agree Gordy's Photography lacks panache.  Or style.      If you are going to stick with taking landscapes or the type of photos in your link.. then something like Shutterbug Snaps... could be catchy.  But if you are going to incorperate portraits, and I think that can be your bread and butter if you are going to do this as a profession, you should go with something like in the above paragraph,  Those lends a bit of dignity to your studio.|`|VfqV3JFSaa	Omg!! I had a hard time finding a name for my photography business too. I finally came up with " In Due Time Photography ". I chose that name cause I love doing maternity portraits. Whatever name you decide to use don't forget to register it so no one else can use that name. Good luck.|`|162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	Where do you think your market lies?  Honestly, fine art, especially when it is  a mundane snapshot with high noise and obvious jpeg artifacting may not be too sell-able.    Are you wanting to market landscapes?  Portraits?  Still life?  You might have some luck selling postcards,  greeting cards or calendars of local landmarks.  In your position, I would have a few business cards printed and ask in local businesses if they might display some of your work and attach a card to it for potential clients.  Use your name and contact information.  Good luck.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	Distinctive Photography by Gordon  Beautiful Reflections Photography Studio
atwNs5Ygaa	No There arn't any vampires in any one of the books    I haven't read deadly little secrets so i dont know what its about. I really want to read it though cause it sounds good!    But in the Blue is for nightmare series i've only read one of the books in it 'Silver is for secrets' and it was really good. Theres no vampire's in it but its about a girl who has like this magic ability or whatever you want to call it and she has these nightmares that can predict when someone's going to get hurt or die! and well yeahh its a really good book. I bet the other two in the series are really good aswell!!    Ciara|`|mO1s4pMgaa	No, there's no vampires in either books but both the books have supernatural beings in them.  They're still really good though.
uJBnZWtcaa	You're got your own wonderful style.  For a full composition you'd have to first plan it out and that isn't how you work.  Have you ever given yourself more time with a drawing to see if it goes beyond the single, floating object?  Have you ever gone back to a drawing to see if you can take it further?
DFXS4SB4aa	The Lottery is really good. I suggest you read it yourself and do your own homework.
WshwHtk9aa	The honest truth is it sounds a lot like Twilight. Werewolf, vampire, unbreakable bond, etc. And if not Twilight, then Underworld or any one of a dozen other vampire/werewolf combo movies.     Definitely switch out the vampire. And don't let the monster you invented just sound like another name for a vampire, either. Make it different.    That said, there are some interesting ideas, otherwise. You just have to flesh them out more and make sure they all have reason and meaning.|`|klPvo7iwaa	vampires and werewolves??? ugh.....

m9bRpmN4aa	It's funny how people concept "Emo" as a stereotype of someone when the word was actually first invented as a genre of music. Anyway.....    She became depressed yes, to the point where she purposely did dangerous things so she could hear Edward's voice, and she also had no life in her and was always moping around. She never socialised anymore after he left. Guess you can say she was, love can do that kinda thing to you, I know how her character felt, so I can relate to her in New Moon.|`|TwyzWDBZaa	no, ha ha! but I see your point, she gets depressed, but she doesn't cut herself, not on purpose anyway!|`|1a0cdf84b10327b2e35d799092f75617aa	no. she just did dumb stuff so she could hear edwards voice again|`|YKMu1jJ8aa	i guess you could say that lol|`|LMNAJxf7aa	LOl that's what i thought too but no, she just gets EXTREMELY upset because edward leaves, so for a few months she like the living dead sorta yeah and she like is all alone and stuff she doesn't see the point in living...okay so i guess that does make her a little emo but not in the black-ish and cutting way|`|s3HK7Mv1aa	Right.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	Very much so. Edward left so she became depressed and used Jacob for his friendship. She was very emo.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	Not so much emo as a whiny, self-pitying, annoying, mopey, dependent anti-feminist.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	annoyingly so|`|GpArrlQZaa	No not in the stereotypical sense.

bF4HAvsZaa	The 'Box ' Playgoers put 1 penny in a box at the theatre entrance.    The Stage Gallery above the Stage Wall-  The ' Lord's rooms ' Immediately above stage wall was the stage gallery that was used by actors (Juliet's balcony) & the rich the nobility -  known as ' Lord's rooms.'  The ' Lord's rooms ' Considered the best seats in the 'house' despite the poor view of the back of the actors. The audience would have a good view of the Lords. And the Lords were able to hear the actors clearly. The cost was 5 pence & cushioned seats were provided.    The seats in the galleries would have been somewhere between the "groundlings" (1 pence).  and The Lord's Rooms (5 pence).|`|Ahud6tPZaa	They didn't sit. The audience stood during the performances.

cxDbdhELaa	Society doesn't need to assign value to human life.  Our instincts do that for us.  A society which tends to assign value to human life is a weaker society.|`|QXhfiYanaa	Fresh Earth or Oil.|`|AA11703549	Well, if you're looking at it from the point of view of society, than I think the value of a human life would be based on how they can further society.    So your topic sentence would be something like, "Society would assign value to human life according to what a person can do to help that society."|`|HfF4EAAhaa	I dunno. Say something like, "society should value people for their skills and personality, not their appearence or monetary possessions"?|`|spYpsixUaa	Can we please dispense with the Pragmatists?  It is only in the demise of the purpose-driven life that we see the folly of the esoterica which leaves Money-grubbers pandering over their bills and assigning values to human life, as though a dollar-sign could be affixed to their foreheads so that they could fawn over their faces in the mirror, primping and preening their hairdos in order to accentuate that gaudy bling-bling on their faces.  Human Life is beyond value, transcends the almighty dollar, and pardon me for saying so in this spam-happy troll-fest of an internet!|`|9R0wRAxbaa	The value of anything can only be measured by its purpose.     So, the principles society is based on, will drive the way it regards Man and what is Man, and that way will drive how society assigns value to human life.    For example, if Man is a being created by God with a divine purpose for life, then the life of every human being will be taken in the highest level while in conformity with that principle.    In other way if Man is only a product of random, just like everything in the universe, his life will be assigned a very, very low value, or at least an utilitarian value, the life of a brilliant young scientist will be much more valuable than a famine child in Somalia, or than my old grandpa.    I suggest you begin with the "The Principles" topic.|`|Uz7xLUAIaa	Maybe something like this? --> "Assigning value to human life has been an unfortunate occurrence throughout history. However it is still prevalent to this day especially when viewed through a Marxist lens. The classism ideology prevalent in nearly all developed nations results in a human's life being given a value, based solely on economic and social standing."
L1qLlVTuaa	You know this is actually a really interesting question. I see your point because if someone was born blind how can they really dream? I understand that dreams are your brain going through your days events and such but how can you dream if you have never seen anything. This is seriously a great conversation starter with some friends I believe. People may think it a dumb question but I don't.|`|n0UCrYLKaa	totally depends if your born blind  then you dont know what anything else woud look like so i imagin they just see shapes and various shades from whit to black.  people who have become blind they have still got the pictures in there head so i belive they can still see images they have seen from there experiences.|`|h3gMzNS3aa	This has been asked before and someone answered it well based on what a blind person told them.    A person born blind doesn't see anything. They dream only with the senses they use.  A person born half-blind who became full blind sees only as much as they've experienced. So they see only the blurry pictures they experienced.  A person born with full vision sees with full visions. Bees see more colours than humans do but a human will never dream what these extra colours are even though technically the brain might be able to imagine it, but it doesn't.|`|ZKQgAtBsaa	It depends if they were born blind or not, I suppose.  I think that people who are blind, but weren't born that way can see in their dreams.  I doubt that people who've never seen anything can see in their dreams.  If they've never seen anything, then they wouldn't know what anything looks like, so they couldn't possibly see anything in their dreams, in my opinion.  But, that's just my opinion, if I knew any blind people, I'd ask them, but I don't, lol.|`|AA11488628	i guess. one that is not totally blind or once could see most defiantly. in their dreams they would remember what they once saw. the mind is a wonderful thing and will fill in the blanks for you sometimes. as long as you have that part of your brain that processes sight i am sure that you can see in your dreams.  the eyes might be missing but the imagination is unlimited.|`|3F3y00ipaa	Thank you so much for asking. i have been blind for six years and through residual memory, i usually dream in images. For me, it is a beautiful experience, because at least in that realm i have my "sight" back. i do dream sometimes in only auditory senses though, a phenomenon that is happening more often as the years go by since i lost my eyesight. Those people i know in a support group who have been blind all their lives dream this way exclusively.|`|CLB32006aa	Maybe they just dream of the sounds, smells, etc they experienced during the day. Similar crazy things happen in their dreams but just remove the sight out of the equation.|`|YmtNel5haa	I have never given this question any thought before.    I would agree with your top answer.  I mean think about it, we can do amazing things in our dreams we can't do in reality like fly.  So, I don't think it would be too much of a stretch if it was for a blind man seeing.  Makes me think of that song Blind Man by aerosmith.|`|UY6c7DG8aa	Biologically yes it is possible  but not to someone who never  seen colours, as it is too far off their reality.|`|dcovK6oqaa	I think they can because they are reincarnation of other lives. i believe in past lives. i had a blind friend and she told me that she could see in her dreams and she ws borned blind.|`|acf2c4c647ac5cade01d5fbace174430aa	nope, they hear things though.|`|1l69CCScaa	I think I can answer this from a scientific perspective.  My friend did a study of blind people in second year university and I edited for grammar.  So obviously top-notch qualifications talking here :D      When a person is born blind they perceive the world through alternate means.  Just as sighted people can see, hear, and feel in their dreams blind people can hear and feel.  Their perception of reality is different from ours and limited to different sensations.  Short answer, blind people dream through their other senses.  They can dream they're in a large room but this conception of a large room is entirely based on touch and internal spacial dimensions.    However, those who became blind after birth can dream like other sighted people.  These people can imagine colour and illustrate the world inside their own head quite easily.  People blind since birth can't do this because they have never experienced the sense of sight.        It's like how we can't dream what it's like to be a bat seeing through echolocation.  Sure we an speculate, but non of us have truly reconstructed reality through sound bouncing into our ears to such a degree as bats have.|`|ttPIfkuraa	Well, ask yourself that question of when you dream do you see? I don't think I see when I am dreaming.
ye6IiFr7aa	words- hmm my book a chapter is about 2000- 4000.   pages- 10- 25 area  paragraphs- 30- 70 range is good.

I've read books where most new pages are a new chapter and then other books have have nearly 50 pages before the next chapter.|`|944a14c77cfd5df8decc7beffcf31f38aa	some books can have not even a page for a chapter, some can have as many as 60 pages for ONE chapter, which would be as many as 30,000 words, and for one page it could be only 300 words..... there is no standard for a chapter and to get every single book and find an average from all the chapters.... it would take a looooooong time, I'd have to say the avergae would be from 1 - 1000 pages, lol, but for me if I had to guess, if you put a book in my hand and said how many pages are in chapter 3 I'd guess about 6... normally 4-20 pages, which translates to, assuming there's an average of 330 word per page   1320 words -  6600 words..... yeah but again a chapter can be as long or as short as it needs to be.|`|AHuBqplbaa	A chapter should end when it is finished - no sooner, no later.

Chapters can be as short as one page or as long as 50 or more pages. It all depends on how many words are required to complete that phase of the story.

LVpyaf48aa	if you are using standard modern film then you can have it developed anywhere that develops film in your area. but if you take it to a pro lab and tell them what you're doing and why they may work with you to get the exposure adjusted to a usable level.|`|ctNsTJJoaa	You can try... The bad news is: it probably did not work.  Film is super sensitive to light.  You have to be really fast with your exposure and make sure the camera is completely light tight.  Color film is worse, black and white can be a bit more forgiving.  The only pinhole cameras I have been successful with have used black and white photographic paper (much less sensitive).     Make sure you load and unload the camera in COMPLETE darkness. Any exposure to light will ruin it (even red darkroom lights). Sit in a dark room like a closet for 2-3 minutes and you will see light coming from under the door - put down blankets to block it.  Then load/unload your film.    But I hoped your photos come out.  Bring them into a target or cvs or wherever and give it a try... To completely answer your question though - chemicals will be needed, but you do not have to handle them.

What about a girl who falls in love with a guy who can't speak (who gave her his email address at the mall or something after they catch each others eye) but she doesn't find out that he can't speak until after they exchange several emails and IMs. Like, she finds out on teh first date. She gets super angry that he didn't tell her, and can't figure out how she feels about him... does she hate him for not telling her? Or maybe she's just really uncomfortable around "handicapped" people, and hates herself for trying to convince herself that she doesn't like him - because she KNOWS she likes him.|`|MJdUkar5aa	Ok, here's how it goes.

SYrJiDKwaa	Dark Summit by Nick Hiel    Dead Lucky by Lincoln Hall|`|quSN2WVjaa	Depending on your reading level (I believe I was 15 when I read this, but also, I am a fairly good reader), I think the book "Into Thin Air" by Jon Krakauer is pretty good.    (As far as I know), it's based on a true event of the author's ascent on Mt. Everest. There was a storm, and it recounts the entire experience, which was tragic (leaving a couple member's of his team dead).    A lot of the book is build-up, and it can be a little boring at first, but once you get to the actual ascent, I thought it was very interesting.  It definitely has some action.    If you try reading it, and it doesn't work out for you for some reason, I would definitely try reading it again in a couple years, it's worth it in my opinion.

The Man vs. Nature would be humans trying to rid of pain and suffering, as well as colors and all of these things like twins who will look exactly the same. They constantly battle against things that would be normal in our lives today.  The last one man vs. self would be Jonas receiving all these memories, continues to go against his own community that brought him up.

Like, she probably SHOULD be worried since she is getting blah grades and her dad cares.  So could she get better grades?  Change her habits?  WHat would it take?

pI5jKfmaaa	In the late 19th century, between roughly 1875 and 1900, a handful of European nations conquered most of Africa. Since this came after more than three centuries of relatively cooperative trading activity between Europeans and Africans, it represents a significant departure in world history. This "Age of Imperialism" also had long-range consequences including the spread of European languages around the globe, the creation of borders that sparked many subsequent conflicts, and the construction of institutions that made globalization possible. As a consequence, this course begins with an examination of European and African societies in the 19th century in order to determine why Europeans chose to invade Africa in the late 19th century.       EUROPEAN SELF-IMAGE   By the mid-19th century, Europe had undergone two major changes that affected their beliefs about themselves. In his book A Generation of Materialism, 1871-1900 (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1941), Carlton J. H. Hayes listed the following major developments in Europe:       the French Revolution introduced the idea of the nation- state as an organizing concept for politics, and the Napoleonic Wars showed the strength of the nation-state   the rise of Liberalism supported a belief in progress and change   the Industrial Revolution changed how people worked and acquired goods, the number of goods in circulation, and economic relationship between industrialized and non-industrialized regions of the world   art and religion adapted to the new emphasis on materialism   new techniques for communication and organization gave rise to the concept of "the masses" as a political and economic force   Carrington went on to say that these changes led to the "resurgence of economic nationalism and national imperialism." they initiated a period of intense national competition that culminated in two world wars in the 20th century. That competition, coming at the end of the 19th century, provided a direct challenge to the balance-of-power system created in 1815 to keep the peace in Europe after the Napoleonic Wars.     Confident in the superiority of their culture and institutions, Europeans looked for the same in the rest of the world, and related to other societies as if they existed on a continuum from "primitive" to "developed." In assigning these positions, Europeans looked especially at the level of material culture and the size of political institutions. Northern Europeans occupied the top end of the continuum while southern Europeans, Arabs, Chinese, Native Americans and other groups occupied lower positions. Black non-Muslim Africans were near the bottom, just ahead of Australian aborigines.   EUROPEAN BELIEFS ABOUT AFRICA   Three centuries of the slave trade had taught Europeans that Africans were inferior, and that helped to justify the imperialism in the minds of many Europeans. Even slave abolitionists contributed to this by arguing that Africans had to be "protected" from slavers; i.e. they couldn't take care of themselves. The limited information brought back to Europe by explorers like Mungo Park and Henry Morton Stanley made Africans appear warlike and/or childlike, and they wrote books and gave lectures that popularized the notion of Africa as "the dark continent." For example, this relatively favorable quotation from a first-time visitor to Africa illustrates the prevailing beliefs among Europeans:     "As we steamed into the estuary of Sierra Leone on November 18th [1889], we found Africa exactly as books of travel had led us to anticipate--a land of excessive heat, lofty palm-trees, gigantic baobabs, and naked savages. At five o'clock we dropped anchor at Free Town, called, on account of its deadly fevers, the `white man's grave.' Immediately, our vessel was surrounded by boats filled with men and women, shouting, jabbering, laughing, quarrelling, and even fighting. ... Without exception it was the most confusedly excited and noisy lot of humanity I have ever seen."   Source: William Harvey Brown, On the South African Frontier: The Adventures and Observations of an American in Mashonaland and Matabeleland (New York: ***** Universities Press, 1970; London: Sampson Low, Marstan & Co., 1899), 3.     Victorian philosophers even had an explanation for African backwardness. According to late 19th century science, human development took place in three stages: savagery, marked by hunting and gathering; barbarism accompanied by the beginning of settled agriculture and civilization which required the development of commerce. European scientists believed that Africa were stuck in the stage of barbarism because they lived in a place with such good soil and climate that it provided "tropical abundance." The ease of life in Africa made Africans fat and lazy. For proof, Europeans relied on data about the work habits of African-American slaves (who had their own reasons for working "slow"), and they ignored how seasons determined the rhythm of work for African far|`|AA12095483	Africa was not - and still is not - a united nation. That's why it was so easy for Europeans to penetrate and dominate the various nations in Africa. Think of the US - now pretend each state is a separate country and these countries are often at war with one another. If a foreign power attacked one of these countries, its neighbors would not rush to its aid. That's roughly what happened in Africa.

mqV9TOv0aa	Shirley Temple was easily the most popular and famous child star of all time. She got her start in the movies at the age of three and soon progressed to super stardom. Shirley could do it all: act, sing and dance and all at the age of five! Fans loved her as she was bright, bouncy and cheerful in her films and they ultimately bought millions of dollars worth of products that had her likeness on them. Dolls, phonograph records, mugs, hats, dresses, whatever it was, if it had her picture on there they bought it. Shirley was the box-office champion for three straight years, 1936-37-38, beating out such great grown up stars as Clark Gable, Bing Crosby, Robert Taylor, Gary Cooper and Joan Crawford. By 1939, her popularity declined. Although she starred in some very good movies like Since You Went Away (1944) and the The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer (1947), her career was nearing its end. Later, she served as an ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia. It was once guessed that she had more than 50 golden curls on her head.

W9C7m130aa	Well it all depends on what type of dancer you want to become. I suggest you take as many dance classes you can get your hands on. From Hip Hop to Ballet, African, Tap and Jazz etc. Your video probably looks bad to you because you have no vocabulary yet. Vocabulary is the foundation of every dance style. Its important as a dancer that you learn form, technic, rhythm, musicality, balance, and structure.     Here isis a good peace of advice. If you take a dance class and still have no clue what any of the foundation is to that dance, then you need to leave. Every dancer should be able tFreestyleye their style or understand what it is that their learning so that they can apply it to their branch ovocabularyry.     I advise you to learn how to self correct yourself instead of saying you look like crap. Know how to look at yourself and make it look better. Video taping is a great idea. Just don't post it on youtube!! Keep it for yourself to watch or show it to people that can give constructivcriticismsm. And last but not least, never be afraid of constructivcriticismsm. Its given to make you better. Have fun and remember dance is about the expression of the soul!     Peace and blessings.|`|KRcDX8DLaa	I started dancing when I was 11 and i had the same problem.  I thought i looked pathetic also and it made me feel insecure at class when all these other girls were more advanced then me and had danced longer.   some of the things i did to improve was i stretched alot. Being flexible really hels build confidence. Theres not a better feeling then being able to whip out a perfect split. Even being flexible can help make something bad look better.  Along with jazz i took a ballet class. it helped me on my balance which i needed doing some of turns in jazz. If you dont want to take ballet just work on your abs and upper body strength. Its important to be abe to have good balance in any dance you take.  I did alot of free style in my room also. Jazz is a quirky, fun dance that can go from looking sloppy and miserable to very enjoyable by just letting loose.  Try to make the combintations and steps a little more you by just tweaking them a little bit to make you stand out but not totally mutating it into something else.  I also started assiting. Although the class was pretty young it helped with my confidence and it actually taught me things without knowing. If you like kids you should ask your instructor if you could assist a class. starting off you should probably try a 3 and 4 year old combo like i did. I'm 17 now and i still teach that age but i also do some classes 10 and up. Also teaching the young children is very rewarding in so many ways. I would highly suggest it.  If you dont have friends in your class make friends. It helps to let go and be yourself when you can laugh and joke around with people your comfortable around.  Just pratice practice practice! practice combinations untill you feel confident. Once the dance starts to be coeogrphed then you can spend timless days and months perfecting it  to where you know you look amazing.  Hope that helps. Have fun with dance its a great way to express your self and to let go of your feelings! im sure your great and your only gonna get better!! let me know how you do =]|`|7ce8785c40a46d28ea03b5eaa72737e1aa	It's wonderful that you love to dance!  It's not so wonderful that you feel your dancing is pathetic.  Confidence and loving what you're doing are important in dance.  My hip hop instructor frequently tells my class that it's more enjoyable to watch someone who doesn't have the moves exactly right but is dancing their heart out than someone who has all the moves right but isn't going for it and enjoying themselves.    Talk to your teacher before or after class - ask if you were doing anything wrong and how to improve.    Practicing choreography is great, do it!  But if you personally feel that you don't like your dancing, learning some easy choreography from someone else is probably a better way to start out. A music video, your teacher, your school's dance team, a movie - anywhere, really.  It just depends on what style of dance you're looking at doing.  Once you feel comfortable and feel that you look good doing it, change it up a little, add in your own flavor.  Do this more and more and eventually you'll have your own routine.    The very best way to improve, though, is to get your teacher's advice and practice. Stretch every day as well.|`|oa4t9Yyyaa	The most important things you can do are to practice and stretch. Focus on the type(s) of style you enjoy and want to learn (like jazz, ballet, tap, etc.) Stretch everyday to improve your flexibility which will improve ballet and jazz technique.     Taking as many dance classes as possible is the best thing you can do. This will expose you to different types of dance styles and you will have a teacher that is able to help you.

cxDbdhELaa	Philosophy was the eventual result of mankind's differentiation from the gods.  Religion is mankind's attempt to undo this differentiation.|`|1l69CCScaa	The most immediate effect of philosophy upon religious belief, and practice, was in Classical Greece.  The Sophists, kind of like skeptics for hire, would openly question religion.  This form of questioning, although it could never be too blunt, led to certain philosophical ideas that severely undermined the power of religious doctrine.    For example: Socrates forced divine command theory (i.e. What is right is what god says is right) into a dilemma.  Either what god says is right is moral, or what is moral is what god says is right.  The consequences of this dilemma are great and I encourage you to research the Euthyphro dilemma for further explanation.    Since Socrates almost every aspect of religion has been severely undermined by philosophy.  From the morality of deities to the metaphysical implications of the supernatural and miracles philosophy has collectively reduced religion into a belief, rather than a sound interpretation of the universe based upon empirical and rational principles.|`|Cf8VzXVZaa	the notions of God could be challenged and questioned. and must hold up to the same standards as every other metaphysical statement about the existence of things in the world. there are no shortcuts.|`|spYpsixUaa	Consistency.  Philosophy taught Religion how to explain itself, which in turn led to a greater awareness of heresies.  Some might say that understanding heresy is a bad thing, but Milton taught us that refusing to understand evil is a willingness to be perverted by it.|`|fDHOKkjdaa	I'd answer, philosophy did not have been invented; it is an action of reflexion and criticism about a questioning through a rational answering process. In other word, thinking  and judging is philosophy; a simple reflexion is philosophy.    So, men were able to think logically. Reconfigure the question like:  how does philosophy influence man's perception of religion.    Some Atheists say it challenges God's existence.     It's not the matter to prove, but to question and answer by your own. Discussion in ideal term to come to a consortium where everyone stated their point until they agreed.

When her childhood soul mate Cameron Quick miraculously reappears, Jenna's carefully cultivated persona begins to unravel. Tension builds as readers wonder how long Jenna can keep up appearances, what made Cameron vanish so many years ago and whether the two will consummate their love. Jenna and Cameron's preternatural bond remains at the core of this original story.  ______________________________________...  *Lock and Key by Sarah Dessen:  Ask twenty people to define "family," and you'll get twenty different definitions. Ruby's definition of family is about to change, and she's not quite sure what that means.     For years, Ruby and her mother moved from apartment to apartment. They lived in random places and cramped spaces above other people's garages. Finally, they find a little yellow house to rent. Ruby's mother, preferring to drown her sorrows in alcohol than deal with them head-on, made her daughter give her excuses to visitors, landlords, and bosses.     The older Ruby got, the more her mother depended on her - and on substances. Ruby became used to her mom disappearing for a few days now and then. When a week turned into two, then three, then a month, Ruby knew her mom wasn't coming back. She went to work and school and lived alone for months before her landlords realized what was going on.     With Ruby seven months away from her eighteenth birthday, child services stepped in. She is sent to live with her older sister, who hasn't seen her in ten years. Cora left for college and, according to their mother, never looked back. Now Cora has a successful career, a husband who is equally successful, and a gorgeous home, with a spunky little dog to boot. How can Ruby fit into this household, let alone into a new school that's posh and private? She's so sure that this could never be her home, her life, that she prepares to run away that very first night and go back to the little yellow house. Fate has other plans for her, and so does Nate, the boy next door.     *Just Listen by Sarah Dessen:  Annabel Greene seemingly had everything: cool friends, close family, good grades, and a part-time modeling career in town. But it all came crashing down, and Annabel has spent the summer in shaky, self-imposed exile. She finds herself dreading the new school term and facing, well, everyone again. The last thing she wants to do is revisit old friendships while the losses are painful, the secrets behind the rifts are almost unbearable. Her solid family seems fragile, too. What happened to cause the stiff silences and palpable resentments between her two older sisters? Why is no one in her loving but determinedly cheerful family talking about her middle sister's eating disorder? Annabel's devastating secret is revealed in bits and snatches, as readers see her go to amazing lengths to avoid confrontation. Caught between wanting to protect her family and her own struggles to face a devastating experience, Annabel finds comfort in an unlikely friendship with the school's most notorious loner. Owen has his own issues with anger, but has learned to control it and helps her realize the dangers of holding in her emotions.    *This Lullaby-Sarah Dessen:  "I had no illusions about love... It came, it went, it left casualties or it didn't. People weren't meant to be together forever, regardless of what the songs say." Remy doesn't believe in love. And why should she? Her romance novelist mother is working on her fifth marriage, and her father, a '70s hippie singer, left her with only a one-hit wonder song to remember him by. Every time Remy hears "This Lullaby," it feels like "a bruise that never quite healed right." "Wherever you may go / I will let you down / But this lullaby plays on..." Never without a boyfriend, Remy is a compulsive dater, but before a guy can go all "Ken" on her (as in "ultra boyfriend behavior") she cuts him off, without ever getting close or getting hurt. That's why she's stunned when klutzy, quirky, alterna-band boy Dexter inserts himself into her life and refuses to leave. Remy's been accepted to Stanford, and she plans on having her usual summer fling before tying up the loose ends of her pre-college life and heading for the coast. Except Dexter's not following Remy's tried-and-true rules of break-up protocol. And for the first time, Remy's questioning whether or not she wants him to.    *Someone like you by Sarah Dessen:  Halley has always been close to her mother, a therapist who publishes books about adolescent behavior. But the summer before her junior year of high school, Halley begins cutting the umbilical cord. She and her best friend, Scarlett, start hanging out with Ginny Tabor ("a cheerleader with a wild streak a mile wide and a reputation among the football team for more than her cheers and famous midair splits"); Halley dumps her nerdy boyfri|`|vsGtzWR8aa	- The Tower & the Hive series by Anne McCaffrey    - The Obernewtyn Chronicles by Isobelle Carmody    - The Deep Field by James Bradbury    - The Fingerprints series by Melinda Metz    - The Autumn Castle by Kim Wilkins    - Atonement by Ian McEwan    - Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte    - North & South by Elizabeth Gaskell    - Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen
MINy26pjaa	That was Excellent!!    Yes, you should do this for your talent show.  However, before you actually perform it, you should practice until you can do it as close as possible to how fast it would really happen if you were actually attacked by someone so much larger than yourself.  If you can do it that fast, it will be absolute awesome!!  I think you should leave out the very first part and just start the act with you pretending to be on the phone or something like that where you aren't noticing him.  Then he comes up and attacks you and you fight him off.    If they have a 'most unique' category, then I think you should definitely win it.  I don't know if you would be the 'overall' winner or not, but if it were me watching then I would definitely vote for you!|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Yes, this would make a great act, as long as you tighten it up to make it seem more 'real' while also showing the great 'choreography' and style.|`|vM2o0Nicaa	yes|`|nTY2RXlkaa	if u do it faster maybe, but it seemed kinda boring. do it faster and with more energy and it will be ok|`|92yiQo7uaa	The two people have to be the same age and the act would work.

Get another younger person and it works.|`|349430e91043395f31bd69026affa76eaa	I love it, I love it !, well choreographed, well done.     Maybe it's because I was into martial arts myself 100 years or so ago or maybe its because I have three  daughters of my own, and this just comforts me to see a young girl that knows how to protect herself but, I just loved it.     it actually gave me goose bumps lol    and I agree, it is not your typical talent, but its your talent, and who knows how many young girls you will inspire to learn how to protect themselves with this? who knows how many lives you can save, how many rapes or mugging you can prevent?  You may get some sort of civil award     but, I really don't think these talents win talent shows.  personally if I were you I would be happier knowing I gave other girls the chance to empower themselves over a talent show title ( although getting both wouldnt be bad either :)    GOOD LUCK   and may God continue to bless you and your talent|`|pOYsO3xzaa	yah its cool|`|JqIhy7Pvaa	well if you are going to may it look more good okaY ITS ACTUALLY PRETTY COOL|`|PmTIPNnmaa	Go for it.

Living life by having others do all your thinking for you must be great.     Seriously, I don't think thinking has ever made anyone happy.

Every time I watch Forrest Gump I kinda wish I was like him, living in a world where I don't have to question things and can trust everyone.|`|L1qLlVTuaa	I have come to notice lately that thinking too much can be just as bad as thinking too little. Lately I have been thinking constantly about everything and it is quite a bummer actually. When I was younger I used to think far too little and people expected very little out of me. I must admit that it was fun for a while not having to worry about people actually expecting things out of you but it gets rather tiresome after a while feeling like an idiot.   As far as thinking too much goes you worry yourself into a panic attack or something else unpleasant. I think I am on the verge of doing just such.  Not sure if that was a type of response you were looking for but maybe it'll be better than the endless spam one may encounter sometimes on this site.|`|As6k5gN8aa	Dont worry i like the whole pro-con listing to. i do it all the time =]  welll if we thought too little then we could have more fun and do whatever and not have to care,, but you could suffer alot more in the end and do something stupid.  if you think to much then you could get technical and annoying to people and have to be more catious  but you would be alot better off in life because you have sense to thing before you go into a sticky situation|`|LhvLMsyWaa	well i allready think to much and i think im fine with it   surprisingly   though i never thot about how much i think  and i like to think aobut philosifical questions like this|`|NY0h5mY6aa	Think too much! By far, although I feel I already do that - but I don't see that as a crutch or con at all. Think of where humanity would be without thinking, where you would be without thinking.  Without thoughts, where would memories, conversations, interests stem from?The world doesn't work that way - we can't just blank out our minds...It's an interesting concept though, for sure.  I definitely recommend "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" if you haven't already seen it, it sort of toys with the concept of having the option of clearing your mind, or retaining your thoughts :D|`|v1BK73Ryaa	I've considered this myself, and I've come to the conclusion that most people really are not that happy in life and it is because they make bad choices or allow their bodies control their minds.  There are a few elements to consider here:    1) If you do not consider your actions and reflect on your past then you will make bad choices and it will make you unhappy in life.  Thinking gives you the power of prudence and foresight which will help you accurately choose the path in life that will make you happy.  For example if you choose the wrong career or have children when you are not ready this will ruin you.    2) If you analyze decisions on the premise that you can create an action out of a thought you will find yourself locked down.  Paralysis by analysis.  For example in trying to socialize and pick up girls, this is not a thinking exercise and thinking too much will ruin you.    You have to intellectualize choices where your thoughts will give you an advantage, and you have to actualize choices where your thoughts will hold you back.    Think of it this way, consider your brain the thought portion of your body, and your heart the action portion of your body.  Thinking too much is basically using your brain when you should use your heart, and thinking too little is using your heart when you should use your brain.  Both suck equally, but you can probably get into more trouble if you act too much rather than if you think too much.    Ultimately, when your brain controls your heart and you are the master of your brain everything is in order.  However when your brain inhibits your heart or your heart blocks your brain you are going to have trouble.

Philosophy is the study of the fundamental (underlying) structure(s) of the universe.    2. What could be more important.  We are always functioning based off of a tacit philosophy that was spoon fed us by society.  The discipline of philosophy simply explicate and changes our view of the universe.    3. Yes.  I have read many books including Sartre's Being and Nothingness, Heidegger's Being and Time.  A simple answer would be for school.  A complex answer would be that society always works off of a philosophical framework which may/may not be faulty.  By explicating the philosophical framework of a given society (namely ours) we are in a better position to frame our world in the most meaningful way possible.     4.  This isn't a question. There is no non-philosophical living, which is to say that one cannot live without a philosophical framework, even if one does not know it exists.

Stephenie Meyer said this in an interview.|`|SYKGIiQkaa	How do they have a Twilight sega? Didn't Sega Geniuses come out in 1993 or did Stephanie Meyer go back in time and crap that up too?|`|TwyzWDBZaa	I'm not sure about the first on, but I'm pretty sure it's in Eclipse...  As for the second question, if they were white before they became a vampire then they become pale, cold and beautiful, if they had dark skin they basically keep there same skin color, they just become cold and beautiful. But that's just my guess!    Hope this helps!|`|gZdxLiv8aa	Well, Laurent was a human at one time. When humans are changed they don't look completely different. Their features are simply enhanced and kind of sharpened. If Laurent had darker skin when he was human, then he will have darker skin as a vampire.     VAMPIRES ARE PALE BECAUSE THEY ARE "DEAD"    Vampires are pale, yes, but the whole point is that they are dead. Dead people don not have red blood and I believe that is why they are so pale. But people with dark skin don't turn completely white. their blood won't  be red anymore, but you can't really tell because their skin is darker|`|iRvAWML6aa	No there noot all pale, some of the voulturi are olive skinned    EDIT    umm i suppose so?  I mean, makeup does wonders!|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I think she's introduced in Eclipse, but I don't actually remember.  And I think they are all pale because they aren't exposed to the sun.  Laurent is different because he is dark skinned. But I would say that he would be a pale dark skinned person.  Just because they become a vampire, I doubt African-Americans would become white.
5XERNFogaa	I'd say the chances are the same as for everyone else. The casting tries to stick with the book descriptions as much as they can, but when there's a chance, they'll go more lenient, like what they did with Laurent. I know Ben Barnes, Prince Caspian from the Narnia movies, said he wanted to play Aro... and he could probably pull it off...    Honestly, they'll probably just cast whoever the hell they want, no matter what they look like. lol.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I guess it just depends on what the casting people are looking for. I think that they could be of any race and their appearance could be altered using makeup and computers if they were right for the part.|`|m9bRpmN4aa	Lol probably, depending on how good of an actor they are. There would be no point if they didn't fit the description of the character(s) then the directors and such would find others who do and who can act. But if they are exceptionally well for the character's personalities and so forth, but they were different looking and light skinned, then they could be made to wear skin toner and all sorts of other make up.    I know that Peter Fanicelli (or however it's spelt lol) had to die his hair bleached blonde for his role as Carlisle, but he was perfect for the role so he needed to. Same with Ashley Green cutting her hair short, and Nikki Reed dying her hair blonde.|`|gZdxLiv8aa	I guess its possible  Though the volturi are italian and will probably be played by Caucasians    For instance, its rumored that dakota fanning will play Jane    But its definitely possible|`|HBWp3Fxhaa	Depends on who you want to play for the cast.|`|1a0cdf84b10327b2e35d799092f75617aa	i suppose lol

Ct91F1Tlaa	Hello Shinjiik,  Here are a couple of ideas, depends on how much detail you want.  If you want huge detail the 2nd and  3rd volume of the Cambridge The History of Russia,  would be the thing.    Check links below to see both, you can also preview the books from there.  The Cambridge History of Russia Twentieth Century  edited by Ronald Grigor Suny  Published by Cambridge University Press, 2006  ISBN 0521811449, 9780521811446  842 pages    The Cambridge History of Russia: Imperioal Russia, 1689-1917  By Maureen Perrie, Dominic Lieven, Ronald Grigor Suny  Contributor Dominic Lieven  Edition: illustrated  Published by Cambridge University Press, 2006  ISBN 0521815290, 9780521815291  765 pages    If you want something less heavy going, the best plan is to visit a good sized library they should have some you could browse through and borrow.  You may need to get one for the 20th century revolution to cold war and another for the previous century.     For example:    A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Putin  By Robert Service  Edition: 2, illustrated, revised  Published by Penguin, 2003  ISBN 0141011211, 9780141011219  658 pages  This book is a comprehensive overview of 20th-century Russian history that treats the years from 1917 to 2000 as a single period and analyses the peculiar mixture of political, economic and social ingredients that made up the Soviet compound    Hope this helps a bit.

LVpyaf48aa	That lens uses a 52mm filter. The most common filter used to protect it is a UV filter available from almost any store that sells slr cameras or available online at ritzcamera.com or adorama.com. They cost about 5-10 bucks depending where you buy it. If you would like to have some fun with filters buy a pack that has several different ones such as UV, circular polarizer, neutral density, etc. imho Tiffen makes the best filters but there are several other brands that are good too.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	look at the front of the lens there should be a number like 52 with a slash through a circle... that number is the size of the filter|`|0AqkCOWIaa	The Canon 50mm f/1.8 lens takes a 52mm filter.

j7o7RsZKaa	As for someone who has been in your spot before, I can tell you everything to do and I will, but you are still going to be so nervous you feel like your gonna throw up... trust me, it's scary, but great! Ok, stare at the EXIT sign or look at the wall or something. Don't look at the people (if your lucky the lights will be to bright). Just practice ALOT because you want to be the best possible. Honestly, try not to think about it when your singing. Thats really all I can tell you because thats all there is to it. BTW I saw Hairspray on broadway so if you have any questions I know about it. Good Luck!!!
jIk2ttH1aa	I loved it.  I loved the color and the curls and the spray of water curling behind him and the expression.  I don't have a problem with him being center.  I think that is what makes it DIFFERENT.  Everyone thinks side composition.  Don't change a thang.    PS I left a vote and comment on the site.|`|GQemfOANaa	What I suggest is that you shoot at each end of the day..rather than around midday as it would have given the shot a bit more of an artistic and less snapshot feel...and the crop as said above needs attention.|`|B7pyVYdRaa	i think it is a great action shot and great expoure and colors   i just dont like that the surfer is centered   if you crop the the photo a little so the surfer is off center i think it would be perfect|`|k8AcVixTaa	Its okay but not great.  The surfer is too centered and overall to me it lacks action.  Sorry but that is my opinion.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	I think that it would have made a better shot if it was cropped more onto the surfer or was more zoomed in from the beginning.  The only reason your drawn in to him is because of the color contrast, otherwise he is sorta small against the ocean|`|GDJGNYFcaa	I think you'd have done very well if you'd paid attention to your composition. With the surfer dead center in the photo, it's just another snapshot.|`|AA10989304	I like it!
sc4BtGxGaa	Hate to cut you off - but scholarship money goes to people who DO major in music, most specifically their major instrument.  You cannot use a flute scholarship to major in computer science - they would revoke it the day you change your major.  My husband had a sloppy piano student come to him with a pushy mother, and the mom said that she wanted my husband ( the top piano teacher here) to prepare her Little Angel to win a big scholarship in piano to pay for him majoring in computer science at MIT!!  Not only were they delusional - the kid was rotten.  And they would NOT listen to any explanation - left in a huff to find another teacher who could *get the job done*.    I am a competition judge.  We hear the Chaminade SO MANY TIMES that it is not even funny.  At one of the recent National Flute Association conventions, there was a seminar in preparing FLUTE MAJOR for auditions - and the seminar was TITLED "Not the Chaminade AGAIN???"    Your band director must have misunderstood you - you cannot use music scholarship money for something else.  If you DO intend to pursue music, and therefore a decent audition piece, then the website of each college or conservatory to which you apply has a list of required repertoire, with suggestions for substitutions, as it were.  You can also purchase an excellent guide book from the National Flute Association, which lists works graded in difficulty.  You can also get a CD-ROM from www.cdsheetmusic.com which has the PDF files to over 200 flute solos, with accompaniment - 56 of them are difficult enough to be possible audition works.    I hope you also realize that FLUTE is one of the most competitive instruments upon which to audition.  I wish you much luck - but I think you need to re-examine your information and your goals - and your finances.|`|dk09NKnmaa	If i were you, i would start learning concertino. i am learining it and i am also a sophomore. it is a really challenging piece and there are many different feels to differen t parts. it sounds great too!

hIhDvVtZaa	Well, at school you can take choir classes, and I'd take a few English electives at school, preferably ones that focus on Shakespeare as that is a huge element in the theater world, but there is much more that you'll need to take. You should take some tap classes, private voice lessons, basic acting class, and improv lessons. Look for workshops in your area that focus on your repertoire, Shakespeare, and stage combat. You really need to build a resume, so do some school and community theater. Also, get some headshots taken to send in when you go to auditions. Best of luck!|`|te2aIm0Maa	Take music classes..like vocal classes..or switch to a school that has a drama class?
CTybrL5kaa	Hello,  A lot of those professional photographers use all kinds of lenses, but when you see those big lenses they really are noticeable. They are telephoto lenses and they come in all different lengths. 600 and 800 are common, but there is a whole field in the range of 400 up to 1200 of prime and zoom lenses. These big lenses are expensive and heavy. They offer extreme magnification and are often used in sports and wildlife photography.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	most of the time your looking at 70-200 2.8 or 100-500mm 2.8 zoom|`|BUi2IFCgaa	about 12|`|B7pyVYdRaa	if your taling about one of these it is about a 100mm-400mm telephoto lens     it is great for sports and wildlife   http://www.letsgodigital.org/images/arti...|`|XD7koB5faa	In reality, professional photographers use all sizes of lenses, from extreme wide angles to extreme telephotos.  But, from your question, you don't seem interested in the wide-angle end of things.    You didn't say where you see these lenses, but if you are talking   "long", you may be thinking sports or wildlife.  For sports, you may see a typical minimum of 200mm and maximums up to 400mm, 600mm. Some even longer.  Wildlife would be in the same range.  Photojournalism would be more in the 200mm - 400mm range.    But, this varies by the photographer and the situation.  One size does not fit all.    Cheers,    Ted|`|FeUmyxqqaa	the most popular lens for sports shooters is the 600mm canon, the 800mm is less popular, the 1200mm is only available apon request they cost 100,000 usa dollars    so if you are asking what are the big white telephoto lens the pros use at sports events then i have answered you    600mm = 2feet et cetera in action: http://www.mustangmods.com/data/12704/ca...|`|YZ8gJjZCaa	The "larger" super-telephoto prime lenses are the 800mm F5.6, 600mm F4, the 500mm F4 and the 400mm F2.8.    The "smaller" telephoto prime lenses are the 300mm F2.8 and the 200mm F2.     All of these lenses have filter sizes ranging from 112mm-170mm.    The most popular lenses are the 600mm and 300mm, the combined weight of those 2 lenses is around 20 pounds.    Here's what you can do with a 600mm F4:    http://cgipix.com/Wild_Animal_Park_Lions...    The light tan bands in the background are palm trees.
ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	You sing in a closed studio while listening to the instrumental tracks through earphones. Your voice becomes another track that will be combined with the others to make the final recording.    Usually, if you play an instrument, you will record a track with your voice after recording a track with your instrument.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	sing the best you can.|`|AA10015648	In a recording studio, you typically "overact" with your voice, since people can't see your movements. If it's angry, or hopeful, or loving, you have to put that emotion into the words 5x more than you would while performing in front of people, because nobody can see your facial expressions.    Good luck!

AA11488628	ok it is a physical communication conveyed through facial and body stance. usually the person will have a look on their face as if they are hungry looking at some really tasty food or thinking i am sexually attracted to the person i am looking at. but yeah a person can give off sensual vibes. we communicate more non verbally than we do with words. it is not what you say but how you say it, how your body is position and moves when you say it, and your facial expressions. it is one of the reasons written word is so very hard to get a point across it is just one that is why there are connotations to words. it gives them more force. such as saying something is big compared to humongous.   these people who say things about you are reading the signals you are putting out maybe even incorrectly as i think might be the case as you apparently don't want to have anything to do with them as you indicate by using the letters wtf. they are thinking that you are a sexually attractive person and they would like to get to know you. or that you have a grace that many guys will find sensual. or sexy.   sensual means pertaining to, inclined to, or preoccupied with the gratification of the senses or appetites; carnal; fleshy  sexy means sexually interesting or exciting; radiating sexuality|`|42223372622a38f2018e30c03299ab0eaa	If you are after a compliment, go elsewhere.|`|AA11894640	If it is not a cultivated thing than you can't just shed off....Mostly it is natural.

mO1s4pMgaa	The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger.

aOd0Djkaaa	Have promotions! Start with flyers to get a free 11x13, I say that big because they will have a harder time to reproduce a bigger pictures. That will get people in the door and it hard to choose when you see so many cute pics. Also the hospital will hand out your coupons to new mothers in there welcome package. you can see who applied for marriage licences and send them info on your services. Another thing you can do is to donate some of your services. People will see you out doing something good and they will associate your name with the good humanity. Contact the local school and tell them you would like to help them raise money, have the students hand out special coupons and you will give the school back 5 bucks out of every package sold or whatever.

This way, you can hand them out to friends, associates, and clients.  I'm not sure how large your hometown is, but here, the businesses are really trying to help each other out, and they often do a "business card swap".  They'll set out your business cards (usually ten or twenty at a time) as long as you do the same for them.      Post fliers on windows or on the corkboards (community event boards or whatever) of local businesses, if they'll allow.  With computers and printers being so widely used these days, this is a very cheap way of advertising...and I've even seen some of the bigger business that are well established turning to this as a cheap alternative to costly advertising.    Try to advertise in your phone book, local paper, at your local radio station, and on your local television station.  Yes, it usually costs money, but business is all about taking some chances, right?  Having colorful brochures with samples of your work and a price list is also another good thing to keep on hand, and also good for giving out and leaving with other businesses.  The point is to get your name out there...and these are all good ways to do this.    If you haven't already, set up a web site.  You can also advertise on social pages, but be sure to keep them professional.  If you have a personal page, keep it separate from your networking page.  But...if you have a personal page, and have a lot of friends, you could always add your business as a friend...and have your friends do the same.  This will network your company to friends of friends of friends.  But be careful (if your personal page is identifiable with your business page) not to have anything on your personal page that might make you look unprofessional.  This is the only problem with using your personal page as a means of networking your business.      Try mingling with others...always keeping your cards handy.  If you go to a party or social function and chat with people, and they ask what you do, smile and tell them...then offer a business card.  Make sure that all your contact info is there (business phone, cell, email address, and a web site with samples of your work and price lists) so that they don't feel like they have to ask for all the details right then and there.  But, if they ask, make sure to tell them.    Blogs can be another way of getting your business' name out there...if you do this in a professional and clear manner.  You could set up a blog that talks about the different aspects of photography...lighting, makeup, backgrounds, etc. Talk about the different things you face as a photographer (difficult clients, children, pets, scenery, etc.), but never complain...make it known how much you love dealing with even the difficulties.  You can also post a link to your business site in your blog.    Just a few ideas off the top of my head.  For more ideas, you could try Google searching "low cost marketing ideas" or "marketing a small business"...things of that nature.  I wish you much luck and success!

Some firmly believe that there are other intelligent life forms in existence, and some ever go a step further and doubtfully claim that aliens are here among us, incognito, they come from afar, to study, to learn about our species, or may be as forerunners of an alien invasion force aimed to colonise earth. Some people believe that we are far too primitive for any intelligent aliens, capable of interstellar or intergalactic travel, to take any notice of our existence, which I personally find very offensive and off putting.    I do not think that there is any conspiracy going on the part of media, where the chief objective is seize upon human fascination of whatever kind that might be, and to keep people interested.

swiOhDo2aa	The simple answer (the actual situation was not that simple) is that since the middle ages (a church court judgment in the 12thC), chattel slavery - as distinct from serfdom - has been illegal on English soil. It remained legal in possessions overseas, and was theoretically legal (because no judgment had been passed against it) in Scotland and Ireland. However, there were very few Africans in either of those kingdoms, so it's a bit of an empty distinction. So, no slaves in England, unlike Spain, Venice (and much of the rest of Italy), France and Portugal where slavery was institutional.    On the other hand, (and this is where it gets dubious) those few Africans brought to England in the 17thC, and increasingly over the next hundred-odd years, could hardly be described as free. They were brought in when children as curiosities, rather like parrots or monkeys, and as a sort of pet for wealthy and noble families. Without a trade or a place to live, they were at the disposal of their masters (or, usually, mistresses) and had really no choice about where they went or what they did.     Regardless of the official position, their lack of autonomy makes them slaves.    This "slavery" was not like plantation slavery in the Americas. The blacks were fed and housed well, and certainly not driven to work with the whip. All the same, as they grew up, the situation must have become humiliating - and the envy of the hard-working white servants who saw them petted and pampered for doing no real work at all must have made things worse.    In the 18thC a judgment of the High Court reaffirmed the principle that slavery is illegal in England. To the best of my knowledge, slavery has never been formally outlawed in Scotland or Ireland, but I wouldn't fancy your chances if you openly kept a slave there.|`|QC94IKIxaa	Despite popular thought, the African slave trade was started by the Portuguese in the 17th century when they exported West African people, caught and sold by West Africans.

dj62bjJAaa	Well honestly it all depends on the theatre company and the director. Some directors will let you stay longer that day if they need to see you do more. Is there no way you can be there for call backs? Theres still a chance you can get the part if you do an amazing auditon. Showing commitment is helpful in getting the role, but if it is something you absoultely can't get out of speak to your director about it prior to auditions and hope they are understanding, because if you don't and you cant be there for callbacks they'll pay more attention to your audition.

WIpeC3gRaa	There are so many different types of dance it's insane. I'm guessing you're interested in theater style dance, like ballet, jazz, etc. so this is just my knowledge on the subject:    Ballet: your foundation for basically every other style of dance. Builds flexibility, basic technique like foot articulation and placement, and is usually required to take other styles. I know of a contemporary dancer who went to audition for a contemporary company and was cut while they did ballet. Ballet should be your number one class option.    Jazz: like ballet, but allows you to express yourself more. Jazz has its own subclasses like Broadway jazz, competition jazz, fusion jazz, etc. and to each has its own elements. It's really nothing without basic technique knowledge though, so you have to keep ballet in mind.    Tap: completely different from both ballet and jazz. You use metal plates on shoes to make rhythms and syncopate with music. Some do it a cappella and make their own music. This can range from Broadway tap to what I call "hardcore" tap, Broadway being more focused on presence and "hardcore" more focuses on the intricacy of steps and difficulty. Here's a link to probably the greatest tapper I know of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kb9usR0a...    Contemporary: becoming increasingly popular. It's a mix of jazz, ballet and lyrical, with heavy emphasis of expressing the feelings of the song. Contemporary can range from really quirky (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iFUtOv3V... to really emotional (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRctSpcYd... to just really...different and good (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eySys7O9C... Heavy ballet technique needed!    Hip Hop: I don't take it, but it involves a lot of isolation and the ability to move sharply and feel the music in a completely different way than most other styles. This is a good example of hip hop, seeing as I can't put it much into words: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96PK6j6nW...    I really can't emphasize the importance of ballet enough, so please think about taking it! Tap is my favorite, but ballet helps so much in the long run. Good luck, and I hope you wind up loving dance just as much as I do!|`|sz2SatQ9aa	i do lyrical,musical theatre and jazz and they r really fun! search up brittany lopes on youtube and look at all of ma videos!    by the way the type of dance that r on tha videos r lyrical|`|PeCm21meaa	hip hop - this is like street dance. may include break dancing and it's most often done to rap or r&b music  jazz - hard to describe.  like ballet but done to faster movement, and less rigid.    ballet - the most rigid in training, includes bar work   modern - very unique in movement, all about self-expression.  can be seen as strange, but is very powerful when you understand what you are dancing.  tap - when you wear taps on your shoes and make sounds that go to music.  lyrical - slow, soulful, like ballet but with more freedom of movement.  there are some other styles but these are the main ones.|`|PuRpsENEaa	I do tap, jazz, ballet, pointe, lyrical, and flamenco. But there are also modern, hip hop ballroom there are probably even more than that!|`|KRcDX8DLaa	ballet- (my favorite personally), its good for balance and being poised.  tap- its fun to watch if your really good at it. (of course the only tap i take is while im teaching the 3 and 4 yr olds =p)  pointe- a higher step up from ballet. requires much balnce and upper body strength to hold you up on your toes. Hurts your feet though. Can cause bleeding.  Hip hop- pretty fun. especially when your with friends. ofcourse you can make friends while your there! Really fun to watch and really fun to perform. I reallyenjoy watching hip hop dancers.  acro- involes gymnastic skills and usually performed barefoot.  jazz- a lot of moving around and stretching.  lyrical- another form of ballet. More theatrical  modern- in my opinion i find it some what odd. Ive never seen some of the moves before and the music is a little sketchy.  theater- a lot of singing and dancing put together.  irish- fun to do if your happy and peppy and feel like bouncing around. Fun to watch also  ballroom, salsa, tango, waltz - all dance i wish i knew how to do  hope that helps =]|`|NG9NuWWkaa	There are many different types of dance, each with a very unique style.    If your interested in trying all different sorts, i would sudgest doing Ballet (you can see what they are from the other answers) Hiphop, Lyrical and Jazz.  Ballet because you need the steps, and  they are crucial for other types of dancing, Hiphop because you develope style that really helps in other dances. Jazz because its usually sharp, so it will help with diversity. And lyrical because its so much fun! Everything flows so freely from your body.    I wouldnt sudgest trying modern your first year of dance, because you need the practise of other types of dance first.    I hope i helped! Good luck! And have fun!
cxDbdhELaa	This is a great question because we perceive ourselves as having energy.  So, if you then look at the expansion of population over the years, this represents a massive amount of increased energy in the world.  Therefore, how can this be?  There would have to be a commensurate decrease in mass to account for the increase in human energy alone.  I wonder if any physicists have ever attempted to use this simple fact as a way to prove the basic equation.    Although, it does seem (when you consider the basic equation e=mc2) that only a minute amount of mass is necessary to generate massive amounts of energy.|`|1l69CCScaa	Energy, as far as we know, can never be created or destroyed.  It can, however, be converted.  For example, e=mc^2 shows how energy can be converted into mass and vice versa. In your listed examples, if wood is burnt it undergoes combustion and becomes fire.  This fire, which appears to disappear, is in fact merely transferring its heat energy to surrounding particles and making them accelerate.      The examples of humans dying is an example of a different process.  This process, decomposition, is worms and other organisms breaking down organic matter for nutrients.        Energy takes many forms.  I suggest the Wikipedia article on it as it explains it all pretty well.|`|AA11488628	the energy never disappears it just transforms into something else. a soul of a person might go off to join other souls in a great big ball of energy or be recycled into other living things that is a matter of opinion. but the energy goes someplace. energy in it's purest of forms is electricity. it is invisible most of the time.
fzU2hP4yaa	It's how the brain is wired.  There are certain centers in the brain responsible for different things, like hearing, sight, memory, emotion, reflexive responses... What you've discovered is a pathway between hearing, the emotional cortex and memory, all linked together in a specific way.      The song links to your memory *through* the emotional centers, so you feel your friend's presence more sharply when you hear it.  Certain smells can do the same thing for me.|`|AA11488628	goosebumps and hair raising (they usually go together) are a fight or flight response. you where remembering your friend who was dead. that made you sad. hurt you. a normal response to highly emotional things is goosebumps it just trips a light fight or flight response for some reason. i don't know why exactly.|`|31On4Ojzaa	memories i would think in the subconcious of your brain|`|A00vouVIaa	its all because of watching scary movies! that stuff fills your brain of scary and nasty thoughts. also watching the news can bring thoughts like that too. ghosts and all that paranormal crap isn't real. maybe you just got cold or something?
r9s0VyJgaa	There are many different ways to play a scale on the guitar.      You should be able to play in any key from any position on the guitar fingerboard.|`|JEb2Kqd4aa	yeah, there are many ways to play scale. and they are not pattern, they are called formulas.|`|AA11488001	Yes,you really need to learn key signatures to truly understand scales and the order of sharps and flats.Scales can be played  repetitively from the bottom to the top of the neck.Strings are strings,learn one string on an instrument and you know it on another.An a is an a etc.A, a = Bb,B,C natural ,C =Db,D,D =Eb,E,Fnatural,F ,G,G =Ab,A.Y... can play a scale,key of G, = G,A,B,C,D,E,F G.This site,or a google search of Key signatures might help.|`|xUuqcKWoaa	to make it simple. yes each scale has 5 patterns they connect and you learn those 5 patterns and you will know the modes of the major.Ionian scale. look at www.all-guitar-chords.com  they are all there. first learn the pentatonic minor then major. then aeolian then ionain.|`|SlZw7MhVaa	Of course! You can play them (scales) anywhere on the neck! If you want to get really good at playing a scale fast or like, for a solo, find the matching chord(s) for that scale and just use a camera or even your phone and record yourself playing the chords a few times and play the scale through that. You really get a good feel for improvising through this. I've only been playing for about a year and a half and I tried this with my guitar teacher an I sounded like freakn carlos santana!       Guitar musicians are famous not just because of "music," but how they play it as well. They know what sounds right with what.
y9ltHzilaa	I don't know how to tell someone to get ideas because I have the opposite problem. My brain is like a story factory. I have a hard time deciding which ones to actually write down. I would say a good way to get ideas is to get in your car and turn on some music you like, and just drive. Try to do it on an empty highway where you can let your mind wander a little. I ALWAYS think of stories on long drives.|`|dsgXLjiUaa	Sometimes I just come up with a story. It just pops up you know. I do have a lot of ideas and make a title so I could remember the story but I never really wrote them down. Sometimes my stories come out of doodling. I doodle something and sometimes a story comes up too. Or some people try to get ideas from the things that surround them.

For the time is scarce mine love is not
hl4kkvXhaa	Well, for me, the answer is simple.  I've never found a book that I love that doesn't have subtle nuances that I missed the first time around.  If I really love the story, I like to think about it (let it "digest", I guess you'd call it) for a while...reading other things in the process, and then go back and revisit the book.  Then, it's almost like reading it for the first time again.      If you like a song, an episode of your favorite television show, or a movie, you don't shrug it off as a total waste of time when it comes on the radio or television the second time, right?  That's how it is for some people when it comes to books.  :)|`|adQI13sjaa	i see what you mean.  theres nothing like reading a book for the first time.  you know, the genuine suspense of not knowing whats going to happen.    i think i just read books again because i enjoy them. youll never have that same feeling, but if you enjoyed it enough you may find something you missed or just enjoy it again.    :)|`|QJpbPWxaaa	Try reading a book like Crime and Punishment or Outer Dark rather than Twilight and perhaps you'll understand why. When a book is deep, there's a lot to miss during the first read.    Edit: I suggested that you had read Twilight because, from my own perceptions and experiences, juvenile books are the only books I would never read twice. I would read the books I mentioned multiple times, as would most other people who appreciate that kind of literature. Again, there is a lot to understand with those books, hence the multiple readings bringing even further enjoyment to the writing.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	I'm not sure... but I do it often.  I've re-read Harry Potter 5 times... I just find that I'm not amazing at remembering, and because I enjoy the story line so much, it's always refreshing to confront the characters I've grown to love so much.  But, I'm also like this with a certain T.V. show.  I own most of the sagas, and find myself re-watching them more often than people understand.|`|zLQLaxhraa	Books are like Movies.  when people have a favorite movie they watch it over and over again.  the same with books, people that have favorite books and can imagine it in their mind read it over and over again like people do movies, plus their is more detail.|`|uZTzird4aa	i usually just go back and reread my favorite parts. Some people reread it to help them understand the book more. Perhaps there was a certain concept in the book that someone didnt grasp the first time they read it that they could grasp and understand the second time. The second time you are more familiar so you can pay more attention to the little details.|`|QMbaeva9aa	I like rereading a good book after a long period of time. I often realise I missed bits the first time round, or discover little details, or rediscover cool things. For example, I never new Harry's uncle was whistling Greensleeves while he nailed the mailslot shut until I read HP1 a second time.    In general, though, I prefer reading new books. My favourite books sit on my shelf. I can read them anytime I want, unlike the other books which I borrow from the library. Though right now I have quite the long reading list, so I don't know if I'll read my favourites anytime soon :||`|iHtskXisaa	I reread for pleasure.  I like reading the words over again.  I also read 4-5 novels a week (yes, I read that much).  Because I can't afford that many new books, the majority of the books I read are books I've previously read.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	Sometimes to understand it better. Some books are so complicated that I don't fully understand what the author is saying.     Other times they reread them because they enjoyed reading them so much the first time and they want to re-experience what they felt when they first read them.    And other times they may reread them just to reintroduce themselves to the story. If a sequel is coming out or a  movie of the book, I often re-read it.|`|SYKGIiQkaa	To find things I missed. I get something new out of Stephen King every time I read him.|`|TmvVyS1haa	There are a few books that I re-read over and over. Dracula, 1984, Wuthering Heights, and Pride and Prejudice. Dracula because I am just in love with the description, this may sound super corny but i get lost in it, and can actually picture the scenery and everything. 1984 because each time I read it I catch new things, and more details become clear, I understand the characters better etc. And Wuthering Heights, and Pride and Prejudice because the characters become endearing, I love them.  Hopefully that shed a little light, no matter how cheesy it may sound but those are my reasons.

fzU2hP4yaa	You are working this under the assumption that to own slaves is unforgivably evil unto itself.  If this is a given then no, there can be no such thing as a "good" slave owner.      The same might be said of Germans during WW2 who used slave labor.  If you used slave labor you were evil.  But what about Schindler (of "Schindler's List")?  He understood that keeping Jews as slaves kept them out of the Death Camps.  He owned a factory and made it a point to keep as many Jewish slave laborers as possible - expressly to save their lives.  Did this make him evil?      What would you say of a wealthy land owner who owned just one or two slaves, but had them live in his home as regular family members?  Doing this would keep those few away from field labor and cruel conditions.  Evil?|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I think there is such a  thing. If he released his slaves, then what's there to stop the ex-slaves from being captured again and being made to be slaves again? By keeping them for himself he's giving them freedom that they might not otherwise get.|`|tcRpXd7Vaa	I would say the Master who beats and abuses his slaves is worse than the master who doesn't.    I think, there could be a good slave master. If:   In the times he lives in, some people are genetically picked to be slaves and if he released his slaves, they would just be captured and used as slaves again.    So then he treats his slaves with respect and does not abuse them unless or until he can help then escape that society.|`|7M3JTnbxaa	Even though I believe slaveowning is evil, if I were a slave owner in the USA in the 1800s, I wouldn't set my slaves free.  think about it.  A free black person in the slave-owning days would have a terrible life. they would not be successful by any means. It would be almost impossible for them to get even a horrible job because an employer would probably sooner buy a slave to do labour than pay a free man. A free black man would be treated like dirt and often be refused services to support himself or his family. It would be a better life to be the slave of a reasonable, courteous slave master, than to be free.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...no...a slave is a slave, to a slave master nice, bad or otherwise...  ...good luck...|`|6fD0r9Icaa	Good question! I agree with you. There can be no good slave master as they took freedom away from innocent African-Americans.|`|YjCfu0heaa	How can a SLAVE master be good? Unless, he buys the slaves, and sets them free|`|vVmsJRTbaa	you're still doing an evil thing. you may have good intentions, but freedom is the only policy

My second choice? Jacob, based off of the first book. His character was just a lot more attractive to me.    Now, if I had to pick actors? Edward's actor. Whenever I see Tyler Lautner, the "Shark Boy and Lava Girl" theme song pops into my head, I used to watch that movie so much! He was cute as Shark Boy, but it's hard to find him hot now when I think back to those younger days...

But, this could not be. So they created a ritual or something, which allowed the mothers to let go of their sons, wailing all the while, but able to let them go and start their own households and families...     There is the way to look at fire as the all destructive fire.   Then, there is also the sacred fire, which ignites us all. This is the fire of the indestructible and absolute...

WshwHtk9aa	Not much.    I know two writers with three and four books under their belts respectively.    One still works two jobs at bars 40 hours a week. The other doesn't work at anything other than writing, but only because his wife is out working to make ends meet. They each make probably 30-40k or so a year from their writing, tops, same as an administrative assistant or a middle school teacher. One's been writing for 10 years, the other for about 8. One did get a movie option and a fair chunk of change a few years ago, but the movie was never made and the money long since ran out.    Unless you are a blockbuster, don't expect a mansion and maids (and don't expect to be a blockbuster - bookstores are FULL of non-blockbuster authors). Writers have a pretty thin margin most of the time. Most writers are professors or teachers when not writing. Or have other writing related jobs, like for TV or as script doctors for other writers, using their own writing as "bonus" money on top of their regular pay.    I mean, if you are a Stephen King, then you can get  $30 million advance on a 5 book deal, plus movie royalties and speaking fees, but the book stores are chock full of HUNDREDS of unknown nobodies making virtually nothing for every King or Grisham or Rowling out there. Stephanie Meyer is the exception, not the rule.|`|8asG4WCwaa	There is no true average.    --Different genres average different amounts (some only a few thousand, others ten times that or better, where the advance is based on the minimum sales expected for the market size).    --Some books sell better to the target market than others. The more popular the book is, the more you make (in royalties)  --royalty percent can vary (hardcovers have higher rates than paperbacks but they also cost more, contract can have bonus rates for meeting a certain number of sales, new author may get lower rate than an established author will, etc)  --first time authors make less than popular authors, and occassionally more than an established author whose sales are falling.  --Some publishers will pay more than others, because they can, but that is not always the best deal (another publisher may be willing to put more effort/financing into advertising the book).     The genre I write in "averages" $8000 advance and 7% royalty on paperback, 12% on hardback.  Once, or if,  you sell enough copies of your book (so that your royalties are more than your advance, which is an prepaid royalty) you start earning more money (additional royalties).|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	Average on a book published by a reputable publishing house?  5-10,000 dollars.     The average author makes nothing.    The publishing world is so radically different from author to author, it's hard to give figures. But the JKRs, Stephen Kings and Pattersons are the .01% of the industry. They can live comfortably off their writings. About 5% of the industry can live well off their works.|`|z36j8rmRaa	Depends on the genre and the experience of the author.  Some make 20% on retail.  Assuming your book sells for the average 12.99, you could bring home close to $2.59 a book.  Of course you have to pay taxes and possibly an agent 15% of that so roughly, $2.00 a book.      Here's the thing.  If you want to write to make money...find another profession.  Writers write because they can't not write.  Some because that's what they're good at.  Others because, you can't keep them from it.  I hope this helped.|`|9fe8cd7cd7906995d59361c072ccfef9aa	This is a difficult question to answer due to the variables that make up for a successful book. The type of book you write makes an impact on the amount you can earn. For instance non-fiction books sell easier and tend to make more than fiction books.   Unfortunately many writers see the craft of writing as an art, not a business. If you intend on making a living as an author, this means you continue to write, even during the wait on rejections. It means being prolific, such as writing a 150,000 word novel in a given amount of time in order to make the whole effort worthwhile. Just as one book gets to print, you should already be writing another. This is how you make money- that and being a good enough writer where readers want more.  Spending years on one project is hardly the effort when you consider many books simply don't make it to the shelves.   I'm including some links I found on the subject however. Don't let a few authors deter you from doing what you want to do, but also consider that it takes work and perseverance to see results.

QyyCnPBDaa	I think the most impact would have to be the creation of the modern state of Israel. After the war, some very powerful people and organizations backed the zionist movement out of guilt for letting the holocaust happen. WW2 ended in 1945, and by 1948, Israel was a jewish state. I don't think anything could have made things right for the jewish people after the war, but a homeland certainly helped. Israel might need to be re-thought in modern times. I'm not anti-semetic, i'm just saying that if Israel didn't have such a chip on it's shoulder in dealing with arabs and palestinians, the world would be a much more stable place.|`|tSZMBTOIaa	Well do you want a school opinion or personal.

mtNxe7Nnaa	God is a mystery but even though this mystery inside my heart is the greatest thing I have ever slightly beginning to realize, but if others are so full of themselves is ok God loves them too, for I used to be one of them too long time ago who didn't believe in anything and thought God was made up by human mind while seeking comfort.   You obviously believe in God and such comment is belittling and attack your belief system. and your love, as humans we protect and defend what we love, but God does not need protection for is greater than all and in her/his love encompass ALL, even the ones who deny his/her existence.|`|FoIxsunVaa	An.

Are you insecure?|`|1l69CCScaa	I disagree with Marcy on this one.  Some people are swayed into believing in god because they feel the complexity of life, whether we're projecting it or not, can only be the result of an intelligent creator.        That said, it's true in part.  The statement presupposes that god is imaginary, and friendly.  It's more like "God is the most prevalent form of comfort people take in the face of great tragedy, and the greatest source of humility for the opulent."      I'm not saying I believe in god, rather that such blanket statements are either deliberately confrontational or glib.|`|8msce8KPaa	the world will deny the lord|`|7M3JTnbxaa	Why?

No more, no less.    I'm a simple theist, I believe in 'God' as people call Him/It. I can see the humor in it a bit. Sometimes people do make up spiritual experiences though.    I would say alot of people Imagine him, but he's not completely imagined.|`|AA11894640	Its better to have a Friend,  even an imaginary one,  than to be friendless!      Do not underestimate power of imagination!!!|`|AA11115430	i think, without realizing it, people believe in god to have something to give them hope.    I mean, if you're in a tough situation, it's nice to be able to say "of course i can get through this, god has a plan for me."   or "it's okay, i know i'll see them again in heaven someday" after losing a loved one.  believing in god makes the world seem less scary.    and you never have to feel alone.  so yea, in a way, god is an imaginary friend for grown ups.|`|vycPaALDaa	Everyone has the right to their opinion.     I do not believe in a "God". Prove me wrong. If you believe in "God" because of faith, I cant touch you. However, if you take the Bible literally or believe in "God" because of evidence then slap yourself.|`|AA11720437	Very offensive, 'god' should be capitalized and the article should be 'an'.  And since it's not really a question, it shouldn't really have a question mark.    Anyway, beliefs are beliefs and facts are facts and the twain shall never meet.  (ie - you can neither prove nor disprove God so why bother trying.  It just upsets everyone.)    It's sad how logical people want to make fun of people of faith when logic is limited to logic.  It's sad how people of faith want so badly for their beliefs to be universal that they impose them on others.    It all comes down to respect and compassion for others.  For we humans are not nearly as logical as we pretend to be and even those who have great intellect also have failings.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	If you don't mind other people's belief, then it won't bother you at all.    The reason why you are annoy, is because subconsciously, you DO mind about people choosing their own beliefs.     You wish to dictate other people belief but you cannot.  Therefore, you are annoy.|`|memleYtRaa	Never heard that phrase before, although it is pretty bad...    God means a lot of things to a lot of people, many don't view God as a person at all but as a force of nature, an emergent property of the universe, a distant creator, etc... all of these could not be considered "An imaginary friend"    However, radical Christian sects with Jesus is your home boy, maybe its a little appropriate.    Still the person who said that needs a little sensitivity training.    People (Such as You) are very sensitive to their beliefs, its best to keep personal views of religion inside and practice religious tolerance.

Somebody else might come along and tell them but they might not listen. i would feel better if i did meet these people and talk to them so i can feel like i did my best but that's not always the case. All we can do is pray for them. I think God is trying to tell you that he wants you to become a C-H-R-I-S-T-I-A-N and find people like this and tell them about his everlasting love and glory.

vycPaALDaa	Technically speaking a year is the same every year. 365 days..except on leap year.    But reality is subjective. Everybody has a different answer because we all live our lives differently in our minds; personal reality so to speak. I have lived a short life thus far and so far most of my years have advanced relatively quickly except when I was in Junior High for some reason. My Freshman year in high school flew by along with my sophomore and junior years.

CIkNuSZ8aa	Camus thinks he has discovered that life is absurd.  Problem:  If Camus is smart enough to uncover this tremendously important truth that the world is absurd, does not his cleverness make his discovery a lie?  If the world is totally absurd, we should have never discovered the fact.  If he burns the bridge of reason then he cannot claim to have crossed over it and tell us what is true about the world.  If he leaves the bridge intact so that he may tell us the truth he has discovered by reasoning, then he must allow us to cross it as well.  The absurdist must admit that at least one thing is not absurd; the fact of his discovery of the absurdity.  This is self refutation at its best.    Oh, and Sisyphus rolls a stone up a hill to watch it roll back down eternally.  Great image of the futile, but not the absurd.  IMO        Ok, Ok:    If what you say in the first paragraph is more than just your personal view it must be judged to be true for anyone who cares to examine the evidence.  Otherwise you are just telling us how you happen to dream dreams or see visions; while interesting, it is not philosophy.  The moment you pull the A is -A argument you have left reason and claim you embrace contradictions.  Since I am contradicting you, you must embrace my contradiction and admit that you are wrong.  I am not forced to tip my hat to you in the same manner and I do not.  As to Camus, if the first question in philosophy is whether to commit suicide or not, I would agree that he has not discovered absurdity, but futility.  He then declares that life is not futile, but that we can be "happy in our work".  I agree that we discover the meanings of our lives by living them, but the flame of consciousness really is making meaning.  Example time:  The love I feel for my family and community are not eternal things.  Does this reveal they are, at bottom meaningless?  I have never understood why it should.  All of this existential hand wringing is a left over from religion.  Human beings create value by valuing things.    As to the law of non-contradiction, I will leave it to absurdists to eat their cake and have it too.|`|iBQ0LF4Daa	Sisyphus pushes the boulder to the top of the mountain, human life as struggle.  Sisyphus watches all that hard work come to no avail (it rolls down the hill) he also knows that it is going to roll down the hill, we die and we know that we're going to die.  We must imagine Sisyphus as happy.  Not happy because he didn't live forever, but happy that he was able to struggle at all.  He WANTS to do it all over again, no matter how difficult.  Mersault, in The Stranger, right before he dies, says that even though he is going to die very soon, he would happily do it all over again.  This world, this struggle is what makes meaning at all.  Existence, brute and difficult, is worth it.  Suicide, even if an other-worldly paradise were available, is not for Sisyphus and Mersault an option (that they'd choose) because this life, this struggle is were meaning comes into the universe at all.  Mersault does not seek for an afterlife, he seeks for this life, with all its pitfalls and absurdity (meaningful being being consumed by the meaningless).  The only truly philosophical question is suicide or not.  Everything else for Camus comes after this fundamental decision.    Sowcrates: your notion of absurdity is askew.     1. If the world is fundamentally ambiguous, then it can be absurd and it can be understood as absurd.  Ambiguity means not homogeneous.  Another way of saying this is to say that something is what is and what it is not.  Take change for instance.  How is change possible at all?  It must be a movement from A to not A.  If it was not, then it would be A to A (which we can all agree is not change at all).  Likewise the thing which changes must have something that say it remains the same through change.  If it lost its identity when it changed, then it would not change but be replaced.  That would be A pops out of existence and non-A takes its place.  The thing which changes must be at once itself (A) and its opposite (non-A).  This means that the thing that changes is not completely A nor its opposite non-A, which is another way of saying it is ambiguous.  If the universe changes, then the universe is heterogeneous (ambiguous).  We can understand that it is ambiguous (absurd in your terms) and not be able to fully comprehend it.      2. Camus is not necessarily saying absurd is the above definition.  What is absurd is that man and man's life is not purposeful (it has no "end") other than man's destruction.  The universe does not care about man, the world is indifferent to man.  Man, however, is not indifferent to it.  Man is the entity which makes meaning, in a meaningless world.  When man leaves, meaning follows him.  He has no reason to live, except the struggle of living itself.  This definition of the absurd goes around your critic of Camus and topples it from behind.  It has nothing to do with understanding, and everything to do with living.    Edit Edit: Sow... Explain to me change, how is change possible at all.  If I embrace one contradiction because it coheres with our average everyday (phenomenological view) experience of the world (namely that things change) why does that mean I must embrace all contradiction.  You are making a jump from particular to general without justification.    Furthermore.  Life is absurd because we must make meaning, this is the inescapable contingency that we find ourselves in.  Just looking at stuff is meaningful, however this meaning is not reciprocated.  It is not futile because this absurdity comes before any "end" or purpose is established.  It is absurd before it can be futile.  Absurdity is not futility because life is not necessarily futile, it depends on where man draws his ends.  If my end is heaven, and no heaven exists, then of course my existence is futile.  If my end is to eat a chocolate cake and I indeed have a chocolate cake, then my existence is not futile until I eat the chocolate cake.  Camus is saying that life's meaning comes from the fact that we die.  Our end is to not be.  We live to die.  If we lived for ever, life would lose its meaning.  We would have nothing valuable to give, to lose, to want, to need, to desire.  It is absurd that we live in a meaningless universe that only receives its meaning from the destruction of the only entity that can give it meaning.      P.S. I like your give 'em hell attitude.|`|27qNNHvoaa	sisyphus represents the human struggle...
AA10616062	The fact that one can easily reverse your terminology...    "Is Introversion a result of too much existentialism?     ...and not arrive at any further clarity about the subject matter is evidence of a dilettante's construction.|`|FoIxsunVaa	I wouldn't call Jean Paul Sartre or Simone de Beauvoir introverts. I would think idealism would appeal more to introverts. That way they would have somebody to talk to.    Or solipsism.    Besides, construct me a rational argument, PLEASE!|`|7M3JTnbxaa	The question made me giggle. It's true, existentialists tend to be a little odd.    However, I wouldn't say having a personal opinion or making an argument defending existentialism destroys it. If anything I think it supports it.|`|iBQ0LF4Daa	Sartre and Simone were definitely NOT introverts, at all.  Their life was perhaps the most humanly public life of any intellectual (perhaps not Derrida) life in this century.  By humanly, I mean, they would spend all day in cafes, sleep in hotels, talk non-stop with each other and friends.  One could find them in the streets.  They traveled the world together.  Kant, on the other hand, left his home town once maybe twice, followed the same exact routine everyday, had few friends, thought he was dying (when he wasn't), and worked like mad alone.  So good job whoever answered the question and mentioned Idealism (transcendental or not).    As for this rational argument.  Sartre didn't even want to define existentialism.  His brand of rational argument is called phenomenology, which is to say, he started with describing (notice that description is not an argument) the world in its average everydayness.  From this description he derives the fundamental principles that drive his whole inquiry. That is why Being and Nothingness reads like a novel at times, he is describing the world.  If he did not want to define, why would he want to defend it?  He did it once, and unfortunately it is what most people read of his.  He called the greatest mistake of his writing career.  Read Being and Nothingness, then see if you think he is defeating his own purpose.|`|AA11720437	Well, it's far from perfect but better than the alternative - unquestioning belief in the status quo...

He's just found a skull of his mate and he's really confused.|`|xZMjrZ7Faa	He's talking about suicide.  Whether or not life is worth living, and the issues of what happens after we die.  "To be or not to be" is whether or not to continue living.  "for in that sleep of death, what dreams may come?" shows his worries for the mystery of what happens after we die.

Western philosophy was greatly influenced by Christianity and Plato. Both share in common a group of fundamental ideas: 1) That there is an indivisible self 2) That objective truth exists independently of any individual experience. 3) That these truths are knowable if the correct thought process is applied.    These ideas culminate today in rationalism and a certain flavor of scientific materialism which both posit that progress exists in the form of an increasing understanding of the world.|`|AA11142708	Whatever we call reality, it is revealed to us only through the active construction in which we participate.

The best example of this is in math where one can explain the numbers 1 and 2, then the concept of addition, and show another person how 1+2=3.    b) When we accepts facts flatly.  The best example of this is in textbooks.  Sure, we often challenge ideas in textbooks, but more often than not we accept them.  Why?  Textbooks are most often written by legitimate authorities who don't just state facts but show facts in their appropriate context.      Why can be believe such facts?  We accept a) because it often appears logical.  We often accept b) because it is expedient or a necessary feature for something else we choose to believe in, such as an a).|`|qdlmy4l8aa	I believe I'm sitting in a chair.

The Protestant Reformation was good too. It started because the church was corrupt and basically telling people that they were going to hell no matter what, BUT that if they paid some money to the church, it would spare them the time they'd have to wait and they'd be able to go to heaven or something. The church was able to do this, because most of the society and people who attended these churches were illiterate and uneducated, so the priests could say whatever they wanted to, and they wouldn't know any better because they couldn't read the Bible for themselves. This is where Martin Luther came in.......... he didn't like what was going on and formed the Protestant Reformation.

Another type uses a bucket of water to hold the sundial, so it is perfectly flat.    Some other methods I can recall  releasing Ravens to see if land is nearby  Word of mouth-  The directions to get to Greenland  from landnama are   From the west country sail west but keep far enough north of the Shetlands so that these islands are barely visible in clear weather.   One should stay far enough south of the Faeroes so that their steep and high mountains are just halfway up over the horizon.   In addition one should stay far enough south of Iceland so that you can't see land but just the coast-bound birds.   When you reached the east coast of Greenland you should keep a lookout for landmarks and follow the current west around Cape Farvel to the villages on the south-west point.    and they commonly used latitude sailing, where you leave from a specific point, equal in latitude to your destination, and as long as you sail straight you should reach it no problem.    Besides that, most sailing was coast hopping or down rivers, T    Both Iceland and Vinland were discovered by accident   Iceland by a man named Naddodd who was aiming for the Faroes  and America first by a man named Bjarni, who was aiming for Greenland, got lost and just kept sailing west. To get back he followed the coasts. Greenland to America is actually closer than Denmark to England

Maybe history should just be written and read, not uselessly and endlessly discussed, not explained by teachers who sometimes do not even know their geography. So, how can they teach us where events took place?    Personally, I discovered the importance of history long, long, long after I had finished school.|`|aJvxMRSBaa	for school, yes    for life, it can be because you can learn from it|`|4FgrnMZCaa	A lot of History teachers suck.  That is the bottom line.  Its just that you are probably at that point that you receive the same regurgitated dates, facts, and figures out of the same American textbook since the beginning of time.  I am not sure what grade your in, but in Elementary class it should by all means be taught to be more fun.  History tells us and teaches us the mistakes of our past and sometimes leads us into the future of our utopia or demise.  When I was young the easiest way to look at History was to envision what someone from the past would feel like if traveled to todays world, or if we could see the future.  I am glad that the History Channels have finally stepped it up a notch to try and be more entertaining than those old classice boring clips like PBS use to do.  I am kind of curious what grade class your in so I can tell what further books to research and made it easier.  Also, what age of History are you in World, US, European?  Once you actually get into the lives of the people living that era it opens up a lot more.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	One cannot move forward without knowing how one got there.    True for all aspects of life.|`|NY0h5mY6aa	As boring as history is in class, it's extremely important!  Learning about our history helps us in preventing the repeating of big mistakes in the past, if we learn about these mistakes and their effect on the world.   IT would be awful to just pretend that two world wars didn't exist, and to pretend they never happened, wouldn't it?|`|AA12097624	YES! Its one of the most important subjects because of the lessons you can learn about human beings and what they are capable of.   I have lived 30 years but I have learned and understood what has occurred during the last 6000 years. These lessons inspire me and have given me a powerful perspective on how come life is the way it is and how much people (who dont know history) take things for granted or solid when they really arent.    However! It is crucial to be introduced to history in an entertaining way. If it bores you , you wont remember and wont care. Start with something that fascinates you and learn to link all the events before and after. Its like an enourmous puzzle that you can piece together bit by bit.     Good Luck!
cxwZtHLUaa	wow that was an impressive bit of dialogue, I'm a writer aswell and I struggle trying to get ideas all the time.  I even went to creative writting classes luckily that solved roughly 90% of the problem.  The 10% was left up to me.  I have typed my story up six times and it has got deleted six times either because of a virus or something didn't sound right.  Your book is unique, I would strongly recommend that you write your ideas on a plain writing pad otherwise other people on here could steal your ideas.  As for the record I have to admit you've wrote a substantual amount of story, I particuarly enjoyed the part where you put about the teacher trying to kill the student.

He had many building projects such as :     *Diribitorium  *Arch of Augustus  *Temple of Caesar  *obelisks  *Baths of Agrippa  *Forum of Augustus    - Increased the public revenue by making the taxation consistent not varying from province to province    - And the usual military conquests most Roman leaders did|`|AA10729675	There is a saying that Augustus found a Rome made of bricks and left it made of marble.    He embellished the city, and made it a marvelous capital for his empire.  Remark:  Augustus was not an emperor.  Never.  He was a "princeps", a prince.

065cf58c48adf6d6e5debdc008900830aa	Ohhhh, you took my question! I wanted to ask that.    I agree, though. Why is it all right that one guy sneak into a girl's room when it's "creepy" if any other guy does. And let's just say it's for the same reason: love. What if Mike or Eric or Tylor got in Bella's room and watched her sleep because he was in love with her? What makes that any different then Edward?    Answer: There is no difference. No one should EVER sneak into the room of anyone else and watch them sleep. And no girl should ever be so stupid as to say to their stalker, "Oh, okay. You watched me sleep? Cool!"    Peeping Toms and voyours are often the first step before rapists and murderers.|`|QMbaeva9aa	I bet Mike's actually a very nice guy who just happened to get very little attention in the books. Move over, minor characters! It's Edward time! Poor minor characters. They're written as shallow, boring, characterless humans. Not too much better than the mains, actually.  Though I wonder if Mike could actually climb up that high.. Bella's room is on the second floor, right? I don't recall mentions of a tree.|`|rSbsj3tgaa	Agree with you 100%. If Edward wasn't so TOTALLY hot, Bella would have him arrested and slapped with a restraining order. But since Edward is her godlike Adonis, all is forgiven! Creeepy.    LuthienT|`|x3zSTbnzaa	because with edward there is something different a mysterious about him and its intriguing. also bella shows no sign of romantic likeness to mike|`|kgH5u4sDaa	ahahaha i would think the same thing that i think about edward--THAT HE'S A CREEPER!!! (gross gross gross)    But i can bet you will get a lot of "That would never happen b/c edward can only sneak in because he's a vampire and cool like that. Plus he's hawtttttt!"|`|XpUF9f1Saa	You're a hero.    There's no difference between the two. Both the same. They're both creepy.    Honestly, all people who think that it's okay for Edward because he's perfect will wind up with their backs in ditches.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I found Edward watching her sleep very creepy. I wouldn't have been ok with it. But Bella seems to be broken in the brain and seems to accept and do a lot of stupid  things.|`|WTOK5ZOzaa	Thank you.    Want to come roll a joint with Twilight?      Edit:To Cameltoe14:Abusive,pale and a 107 year old virgin.THE PERFECT MAN!|`|5L6z92Iqaa	Because Edward is NOT the boy next door, he is intense and the ultimate perfect man. He is smart, talented, protective, etc. (insert description of perfect man here) whereas Mike is just the boy who sits next to you in math class.|`|adQI13sjaa	lmfao.   i loooove you.    there are some other questions on my mind too..   whats the difference between edward and your grandfather?  they are both like 100.. really.. its gross?    and whats the difference between edward and a psycho killer?  they both murder people?     yeah... that book just really creeped me out.    EDIT.   hes like 100 or so. and hes sneaking into a 17 year old girls room. thats illegal. like really really illegal.   i love me some statutory raaaaape..|`|35ff9d3ad1eb64812f64b2031173d7e4aa	I believe that it's just the way that the book was written. Edward is set up to be "teh perfekt" throughout the whole book, and this is just something that makes him more "sexy" and "mysterious".   Mike, however, is set up to be a "less perfect" suitor for Bella, and isn't described in as much detail as Edward.   It's a writing tool; the protagonist is set up so that everything that he does adds to his character. Edward climbing in Bella's window [the scene] is written to sound sexy, cool, mysterious, and caring. We have half an idea about his motives of coming into her bedroom. Mike is a less developed character, we don't know a lot about his motives, hence, him climbing in Bella's windows is frowned upon.|`|SYKGIiQkaa	I love you.    It's one thing when your boyfriend/husband is online next to you in bed and cheerfully looks over at you as you sleep.

Mike's character is just completely different from Edward's Edward's character has so much more depth. He cares for Bella 10 times more than mike even though mike is obsessed with Bella. Edward isn't just an ordinary boy..he's been waiting for Bella his whole life (like 108 years) while Mike has only been around for 17.. he doesn't understand life and love as much as Edward does...That is why I like Edward...not because he's hot...i hate that. Girls have turned twilight into a roll your eyes kind of book...and i absolutely hate that becasue it's a great book I didnt read it because everyone else did...i read it before it as even popular..and i wish all the preppy girls would just shut up about how sexy and cute he is and look deeper into his character than that...|`|3WCXGRaGaa	because she likes a creepy 100something year old man watching her because she knows she cant be raped, because hes a vampire OOO wait they have sex, nvm.... she could get raped...    cause shes dumb. i'd rather having a living thing go into my room that DOESNT SPAKLE IN FRICKING DAYLIGHT watch me. no wait i dnt want anyone to watch me while i sleep!! wtf im 17, noone is alone to sneek in my room and watched me while i frickin sleep, well maybe my boyfriend on sleepin part but still, WHO THE **** CREEPS INTOA  TEENAGE GIRLS ROOM AT NIGHT WHILE THERE DEAD ASLEEP?! a fricking pedafile!!!      -glares-

mZcdC90Uaa	I think anything that Stephenie Meyer doesn't write is pretty decent.  Stefani|`|mO1s4pMgaa	The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.    Other books I've heard were good and planning to read is Need by Carrie Jones, Evernight by Claudia Gray, Lament by Maggie Stiefvater, Beastley by Alex Flinn, Old Magic by Marianne Curley, Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin, the Blue is for Nightmares series by Laurie Stolarz, and Evermore by Alyson Noel (coming out in February)    I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too. So yeah.. you should check it out|`|xfaS9uS0aa	I recommend the Mediator series by Meg Cabot.  It's kinda a litttle sci-fi like The Host, because it's about a girl who can see and talk to ghosts and she's supposed to help them. But it's not all about that. It's really funny.
AA10802349	well first don't listen to Rachel_S165, she has no clue about what makes up a writer(graffiti artist), there are legit crews out there making money and doing it legally. I would say and depending on how good you are start by doing a piece on a wall on your house(with parents o.k.) or ask a business owner if you can paint on his building. Do his/her business name and/or logo.  Get the experience and incorporate it into the art field you choose go into.|`|r9s0VyJgaa	"Career"???

I would definitely talk to your art teachers and see what advice they might have for you. Other than that, from the best of my knowledge, I would expect that you might want to attend an art school after high school. Your style of art could be graffiti and you could be the one to make it popular in museums, and art people would love having in their homes, rather than it just being considered vandalism.

It's only PART of a book, but when I was about seven, I was investigating a copy of an old reading text that my school wasn't using anymore and I came across a poem called "Jabberwocky". I was instantly obsessed with it. I had never in my life seen anything like that poem, and it sounded like whoever wrote it had the same sort of bizarre imagination I have. I actually stole the book and kept it for years, every so often cracking it open to that page to read the poem again. There was no illustration of the author, so in my strange little mind, I imagined what he must look like, and actually used this imaginary individual as a character in various writings. I gradually forgot about my favorite poem until one day, in my early twenties, I encountered it again and was motivated to do a bit more research, so I entered "Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll" into the seach window. Several of the results had photos of the author in them and freakishly, I KID YOU NOT, he looked almost EXACTLY as I had imagined him as a child! How creepy is that?!?    ...and yes, I know everyone knows about that poem and who wrote it but when I was little, I didn't. I thought Alice in Wonderland was invented by Walt Disney for godsakes.    Sorry... they never let us read anything worth a sh*t in school here. I recall it all as having been incredibly boring. I don't care how old it is, that doesn't make it any less dull.

It kinda means, if you play by the rules and don't cheat, you'll be more joyful than if you cheated and won.    Or if you something like Sex before marriage was morally wrong for you and you did it anyway, you would miss the true joy of sex in marriage.    Religiously, people would feel that not only are they experiencing great joy and pleasure but also in a holy and legit way.    While unreligous people may find that, there moral core was not disturbed at all in order to get the joy or pleasure. Like if people tried to get you to cheat but you refused and got an A+ anyway. It would be more self satifying.    Or sometimes there can be no gain at all. Like if you got beat up defending someone who doesn't diserve to be beat up, it would suck, but there would be a prideful feeling that you followed your heart.

xrkKMIwfaa	I am not going to badmouth Roy Benson but I suspect that they are imported from China or the Czech republic.  I have yet to see a trumpet from China that is worth anything.  The main problem is the valves, they leak from day one.  The second problem is the solder joints.. the instruments fall apart.  The same type of problems are there with the woodwinds.. just sloppy workmanship.    Bundy is a student line instrument that is solid as a rock,plays in tune and parts are very easy to find.

1l69CCScaa	When Cicero accused Catiline of treason without any evidence.  His entire speech is pointed accusations in the form of rhetorical questions.  In the original Latin it's wondrous, and difficult, to read because of the word placement.  The entire question would hinge upon the verb/other word and it would be placed at the end.  The effect is an entire question is constructed before it's asked, causing a much more affronted effect upon the accused person (Catiline).
kVWJuytvaa	Depends on where  you want to shoot. If you are bringing it when you surf as well, get a Olympus mju 1030 SW which is waterproof, allowing you to take it surfing as well.. Or a Pentax Optio W60 underwater camera, where both can go up to 3m(Olympus) and 4m for the pentax.  Otherwise, you should get an SLR, a Canon 50D with a 600mm IS lens, and a good sturdy tripod.

I agree with the answer above me. It's the lens that gets you close to the action. You dont go near the water 'cause it'll damage your camera (any camera!).

New AF 10,000.00  Used AF 5,000.00  Manual focus 3,500.00    For a camera you need a Nikon D300 or better, mainly for frame rate. Don't buy a DSLR used, it's a bad idea. I had a D70s, it was too slow for surfing, D300 is a lot faster.    New 1,700.00 for D300, more for D3.    If you want to do it on a budget like that, you're better off getting a water housing and a point and shoot. They are slow to fire, so it's hard to get a great shot, but it'll run you 200.00-500.00 or so for a basic camera and water housing.    Go to WalMart for housing/camera, they are still better priced than CC.    Here's a shot from the HB pier, with a 600mm F4 lens.

RmcgrPMOaa	According to Dumas, Napoleon Bonaparte was imprisoned on the island of Elba and King Lois the something was on the throne of France. Thus, anyone accused of being a Bonapartist was accused of supporting him and/or trying to get him back into power. Edmond Dantes had a letter on him that the captain of the ship had given him before he died, and it ended up being a letter about Napoleon escaping from the island. Basically, Edmond was imprisoned for supposedly conspiring against the king.     That totally excludes the personal reasons behind his imprisonment, which have to do with Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort. Danglars (who wanted the captaincy to be his)wrote an anonymous letter that told the police that Edmond had a bonapartist letter on him, and Fernand sent it because he loved Mercedes. Villefort's father was the man whom the letter was addressed to so he imprisoned Edmond for self-preservation.|`|SupWrLRIaa	Bonapartist refers to Napoleon Bonaparte, who at the time was in exile for attempting to take over the country. He had agents throughout the country, and in others as well, attempting to set up for his return. They thought that Edmond was one of them.    It was bad because the powers-that-were did not want the former king returning because he would immediately depose them. Hence, they did everything they could to stop his men from accomplishing anything, both by arrest and interference.|`|tYiMSItraa	Napoleon had been overthrown by the French Government.  His supporters were supposedly traitors, but they knew enough of them existed that they couldn't execute him without a rebellion.  They'd still catch his supporters from time to time, usually doing something to further the idea of putting Bonaparte back in charge.  Most of Europe was still miffed about all the conquering he did, so they wanted some distance between him and the government.

Anyway, they were both progressive (social reforms, health, children working rights, equal economic opportunity, that sort of thing). That's pretty much the biggest similarity I can think of.

Or, do you derive more satisfaction in going through the process than in achieving the result?    This will tell you whether the person is process oriented or results oriented.

Which are you?|`|AA11488628	well first i would ask them their name. then i would ask their age, hobbies/ interests and so on with the normal questions we all ask when we meet a new person. then i would gage how they react to me. some people upon sight without ever talking to me will immediately not like me. never figured out why but whatever. after i did that i might tell them a joke or anecdote about whatever and then gage how they respond to that. depending on other things i then might say something to shock them. that usually fixes that. but you have to pass all the rest to get to that point and really most people never do. if you can get past me trying to shock you well then you are probably a friend of mine. enjoy being one of a few or a sociopath. maybe even both.   i find you get more of an idea of what a person is really like from watching how they react to different things. such as humor and shock. it is very hard for people not to laugh at things they find funny or at least for a second respond to being shocked. it is honest and all that but i do so very rarely as most people don't hold my interest past the initial questions. but i can hold entire "friendships" using only small talk and absolutely not really caring about the person past what i would feel towards a stranger. sounds a bit cold yes but i am nice to them, i talk to them, and have a passing part in their lives. it  harms none. there is no reason not to be polite and let people have their illusions. and they are always good for a bit of respite from boredom.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...do you speak english...  ...from this you denote if the individual speaks english, has an accent where from, if a visitor business, school or pleasure...  ...and the list goes on...  ...just from that one question...  ...good luck...|`|lsiyoSRaaa	where are you from , what is it like where you come from. what are some of the things you do for fun. do you like talking to people of any age or nationality.|`|SFba2RUPaa	I have found that the easiest way to find out about a person is to ask.People love to talk about themselves.An old trick my friend has used for years(and he seems never to meet a stranger!)is to talk about a persons name-nationality of derivation etc.This usually leads to talk re hometown,occupation,school etc Itt is amazing how in just a few minutes some common ground is established.Asking about problems usually is not necessary-just listen to what that person is saying.Once you get to talking someone usually tells you most of their problems,concerns,etc in just a few minutes.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	The best way is to ask them about their past.

In a nutshell the north was against slavery and the south for it.  This was one of the main issues of the civil war and why we went to war in the United States.  The overall concensus of black people in America was that they were unkempt dirty, and to be of less of a human being than any white folks.  This was a fact, but in some parts of the Government most especially in the north they wanted that changed.  People in the north had slaves also, but not to the degree of the south and the south felt that holding slaves should be a right and if they did not have slaves their form of overall life would collapse, especially if they gave all slaves a choice to be free or not.

wtrjg5l4aa	The Crusades turned into campaigns of slaughter, rape, and pillage, and woe to the poor Jews in the way. Indeed, the Crusades mark the first large-scale European mob violence directed against Jews which is going to become, unfortunately, the pattern for the next hundreds of years.    Here is one eyewitness account of an attack on the Jewry of Mainz in May of 1096. This comes from The First Crusade by August Krey, and it is a letter written by a Jew who survived:    "The Jews of the city, knowing of the slaughter of their brethren fled in hope of safety to the Bishop of Ruthard. They put an infinite treasure in his guard and trust having much faith in his protection. He placed the Jews in a very spacious hall in his own house that they might remain safe and sound in a very secure and strong place."    "But ... the band held council, and after sunrise attacked the Jews in the hall with arrows and lances, breaking down the bolts in the doors. They killed the Jews, about 700 in number who in vain resisted the force of an attack of so many thousands. They killed the women also and with their sword pierced tender children whatever age and sex..."
is4hA8eUaa	What you should do is make a 12 page complete short story manga and send it to as many manga studio as you can, even web sites that put up regular manga comics. The only real difference between you and a professional is that they got someone to pay for their art. I've seen crappy art that gets published, so it's just a matter of putting yours out there for the right person to see ( I don't mean that your art is crappy, I was just exemplifying). Anyway, the important thing is that your style is consistent so the same character looks like that character in the next drawing. For me that is the most difficult challenge.

4828824f2fdd7ff3abab03bbe083839caa	There Are No Children Here by Alex Kotlowitz chronicles the true story of two brothers coming of age in the Henry Horner public housing project in Chicago over a two year period. Lafeyette and Pharoah Rivers, their mother and siblings struggle to survive gun battles, gang influences, overzealous police officers, and overburdened and mismanaged bureaucracies to simply survive.|`|1wJeITvdaa	There Are No Children Here, the true story of brothers Lafeyette and Pharoah Rivers, ages 11 and 9 at the start, brings home the horror of trying to make it in a violence-ridden public housing project. The boys live in a gang-plagued war zone on Chicago's West Side, literally learning how to dodge bullets the way kids in the suburbs learn to chase baseballs. The book's title comes from a comment made by the brothers' mother as she and author Alex Kotlowitz contemplate the challenges of living in such a hostile environment: "There are no children here," she says. "They've seen too much to be children."     This book describes a social atmosphere that few people actually experience or fully understand. It only provides a glimpse into the lives of two boys growing up in one of Chicago's public housing areas, but it will leave an everlasting impression in the minds of its readers. Alex Kotlowitz follows the lives of these two young boys as they attempt to navigate through the gang wars, police and government deficiencies, and the poverty stricken Chicago slums. The boys are under 15 years of age, yet they are forced to make decisions that people much older than them struggle with every day. They are forced to struggle through their childhood in poverty and without a father to guide them in those struggles. Kotlowitz looks at the two boys as they watch their friends and family members perish in gang and drug wars, police brutality, or hauled off to prison for other crimes. They also watch as their mother struggles to provide for her family and the governments inefficient handling of Chicago's public housing. The author is able to show the young boys struggle to get an education and succeed in an area filled with failures. They have few role models to guide their decisions and few opportunities for success. Alex Kotlowitz is able to point out the constant struggle these young boys have faced and the opportunities that they are deprived of. He shows how the environment both physically and mentally hampers the two boys opportunity for success and a normal childhood. The book provides an excellent look into the mental struggles they faced as their friends got caught up in gangs, were killed, and started committing petty crimes. Overall this book provides an excellent depiction of life in the Chicago public housing, and the struggle of those two boys as they attempt to survive and succeed in the ghettos.
7PMpJqiiaa	From the web site "Life of Van Gogh":    Starry Night by Van Gogh was painted at the height of his production and his passion for life. It's a nocturnal picture, painted while he was staying at the psychiatric hospital of Saint Remy-of-Provence. The real drama of this painting is that the artist is not content to commune with nature to understand and paint his subject, but battles to enter into the very essence of the natural world so that his brushes can tell us the exquisitely haunting story from within.     Starry Night represents all the drama of a man anxious of communication and integration into nature. The previous year, in Arles, Vincent had a terrible argument with his best friend, Gaugin. As an act of desperation he cut off his right ear. After this horrible time in his life, the depression came back and he was sent to a psychiatric hospital at the request of his neighbours in Arles. It was at that time, that he painted other nocturnal pictures like The Night Caf, Starry Night over the Rhone and many others.     To paint at night, he hung candles around the brim of his hat, and around the picture canvas, so that he can see what he is painting. He is the first artist to directly paint these nocturnal scenes at night. This need to connect with nature is something he inherited from the impressionists in Paris. The important point here is his passion for the dark night. In times when street lighting was at a minimum (just gas light) and most of the light would come from the houses in the village, the night was really dark.     The question is obvious - what was going on inside the tormented soul of the artist to make him want to escape into the endless black night? Starry Night reflects the anguish of the artist. The energetic strokes, the vibrant colours of the stars against the dark blues and blacks of the night reflect the need of a desperate man for hope in the middle of the "black night". Starry Night is a fight between a man and his anxiety. A scream for hope, light and love.    http://www.lifeofvangogh.com/analysis-st...
GXxOEIzgaa	Wow you are in luck kid... i just wrote a thematic essay on nationalism.      Ok... Nationalism is sharing a common language, heritage,     ure and ancestors.  This force (nationalism) will make the people join together to push out either foreign rule (colonies) or just an inefficient.  Two examples of this is German unification with Bismarks policy of       and iron and Italian unification with Mazzini, Cavour and Garbaldi.    Make note that nationalism can also be a divisive force.  Meaning that it can divide nations.  An example of this is Austria Hungary.  This was a multi national empire.  National spirits arose which ultimately ended in a civil war.    As ideas for your poster you can draw to maps.  One with germany and a magnet drawing in all states of germany and another map with Austria Hungary that has nationalism as a      which splits up the empire.    Hope this helped and good luck on your project.|`|W3H6n1UAaa	In a very simple sense, Nationalism is pride for one's country and people.    In the 1800's, many ethnic groups across Europe (eastern europe, the balkans) and the near east were all calling for the establishment of their own states.    As for drawing it, that is tougher.  I would suggest perhaps drawing a group of people standing together with a flag, with the border of their country drawn around them.

This is because they did not exist AS KNOWN NOW before the person came to America.   If you go to the page for ancestry.com, however.. there are some entries for the name, in the 1930 census, and it is also found on some Russian voter lists that ancestry has. (you will get "bites" on the name..but need to join for the full entry).  You really have to be careful, if looking for "nationality" of a name, since that attaches to political jurisdictions and those CHANGE. Russia is a good illustration of this.. what are independent countries TODAY, were "part" of Russia, even as little as 50-60 years ago. Now, go back to pre "USSR", and they would again be independent, or not exist as known under today's names.   Please tell Crystal to be more careful as to posting personal info online.  But, by using documents such as birth/death records, census records, immigration records and so forth.. you can often work your actual ancestors back to a EXPLICIT location (ie town/village), even when that town could have been part of several different "countries" at different times in history.|`|n5Dqb5JZaa	A name can be of any nationality.

Some highlights (in my opinion) are   - Frodo and Arwen crossing the River to Rivendell and Arwen destroying the Ring Wraiths   - Their inability to cross the mountains  - Attack at Moria and "death" of Gandalf  - Lothlorian and Frodo seeing the future  - Boromir attacking Frodo and then dying for Merry and Pippin  - Sam's loyalty in following Frodo|`|t8rKgXLyaa	You want the section in the chapter called "The Shadow of the Past" Where Gandalf and Frodo are discussing Bilbo Meeting Gollum. Frodo Says its a pity Bilbo didn't stab him and Gandalf tells that many that deserve death live.. and some that are dead deserve life.. can you give it to them?  Don't be so quick to deal out judgment and death! Of course there is more detail in the book but its really good..
wxMhNtXUaa	try to check on this site http://en.wikipedia.org/ there you find about history..|`|dc2cb706f625bf4f0720140360b38e90aa	The atlantic world?    No such place has been explored by Europeans.      The Atlantic Ocean was a major force to be overcome, but the advantages of shipping routes to land routes were clear.       Shipping was faster in most cases and larger amounts of cargo could be moved at one time.  Plus, the fact that not everything could be found on the main land mass of Europe-Asia/India-Africa.   The dangers were well known-storms, rogue waves, pirates, etc, were worth the risk compared to the bandits, wars, plagues and taxes that overland travelers confronted.    As to conquering the New World, greed was the motivating factor.  Minerals, furs and other resources were desired by the noble and wealthy Europeans.  The Roman Catholic Church wanted new sources of revenue as well (tithes paid by the newly converted natives).       How the Europeans conquered the inhabitants of the New World varied.  Firearms, cannons, and steel were usually no match for weapons the native people had; but the diseases were the real weapons that devastated the natives.  Warfare (both biological and conventional) was not the only way Europeans exploited the native people.      Trading cheap glass and trinkets for gold, furs and other sources of wealth may seem harmless until you consider the ramifications.  If tribe A traded with the Europeans, soon Tribes B, C, and D wanted the trinkets as well.   Two ways of obtaining the trinkets were warfare among the tribes and over-harvesting the natural resources.   Things worsened when the traders started switching to alcohol.

Give him best answer.|`|1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	"The Transall Saga" by Gary Paulsen  "The story begins with Mark, a young survival enthusiast, hiking through a mountainous area called the Magruder Missile Range when he sees a mysterious blue beam of light. He approaches it and after being bitten by a rattlesnake, falls in the light . He wakes up finding no bite marks and lying in a field of red grass. He has little time to reflect upon what strange events that have been happening to him as he is soon approached by a strange buffalo-like animal who chases him into a tree and tears up his belongings.    Mark has nothing except the clothes on his back and some survival tools, so he uses his innate survival skills as an attempt to live in the jungle all by himself. He gets food by eating a rock-like coconut fruit and makes a shelter of leaves and branches into a deck. In this jungle, he encounters a very tame monkey-like creature, whom he names Willie and becomes a sort Mark's pet. Mark believes that the world he landed in is an alien world with many similarities to Earth. While exploring the forest, he finds an arrowhead and tracks which he follows to find some creature-like humans, but shorter and with webbed feet and yellow skin. After observing these people for a while, he follows them, and finds their camp. Mark finds their tribal and primitive ways too warlike causing him soon to leave. The next morning, he is taken prisoner by a more advanced, metal-weapon wielding race. On the path to slavery in their village in the mountains, he saves the life of his new friend, Leeta.    After six months, of being in the "Tsook" village and can now speak their language as he would a native tongue. While he is there..."

Charlotte Bronte is one of the most articulate writers I've ever read. It's definitely a great book, and well worth reading (plus its such a classic, you ought to just for the sake of being able to say you read it). I guess it's about love........ but not in a romantic, mushy way. Well, that's misleading. It IS romantic love,but it's so much more than that too. Basically it's about a governess who falls in love with her student's guardian. But I don't want to give anything away :) It also has a lot of drama in it, which is definitely good because to be honest, it's a fairly dense and challenging read, so the drama and occasional humor helps to lighten it up.   I should mention that if you're one of those people who can't stand stories where there's just a little too much coincidence, you could be rather annoyed by this book. There are some parts where it just like........ really? Like that would EVER just happen. But it's not ridiculously overdone or anything, just a once in a while deal.     But yeah, I'd definitely recommend it!

z36j8rmRaa	Most likely you are talking about a prologue.  Let me caution you on using a prologue in today's novels is almost taboo.  Publishers do not want to see prologues anymore because readers do not read them.  Try placing the info in a thought-past-pondering scene.  In other words, let your character ponder the thoughts of what happened in bites.  Do not go on in a monologue.  People will flip the page to get rid of the annoyance.  You could also try fitting the info into a conversation between characters.  Example:  "I hate the thought of you going around him again, after he tried to kill you with his car."    You get the idea.  Hope this helps.|`|vzDgu1xkaa	it is a prolouge and after writing is an epilouge|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	If it's at the beginning of the story it's a preface and at the end it's a prologue.     And ging is right. No publishers want to see a preface in a book. Often readers skip it and go to the beginning of the chapters. I learned this from my creative writing instructors in my class.    You should try and work it into your overall story. A flashback would work.|`|ExK1ebqTaa	pretty sure its a preface|`|U5RTRzKiaa	Preface is something the author writes in their own voice and explains how the author created/came up with the idea.    Prologue (which is what you're talking about) is from the character's voice and explains something before the story happened.|`|wZFlfRahaa	A PREFACE is an introduction to the novel which is not a part of the novel. It is written in the author's own voice, and it usually contains some kind of explanation or contextual notes (such as how the author came up with the idea for the book, who s/he spoke to while doing research, acknowledgment of people who assisted in the writing of the book, etc.).    A PROLOGUE is an introduction to the novel which is part of the novel. It is written in the voice of the story (whether the voice of the narrator, omniscient narrator, or a character in the story) and generally provides some sort of introduction, context, or dramatic foreshadowing of the plot or tone of the novel to come.  ------    I'm pretty sure it's a prologue.|`|92TkCzXkaa	If it is a novel or book of poems the introductory chapter is usually called a prologue, but it is the same thing as a preface.

AA11712689	The worship of the"old gods" were slowly running out of steam before the onset of Christianity to begin with, that is one of the reasons  Christianity was able to take such a "hold".    And Christianity, believe it or not, spread rather quickly. People were ready for a change, a new hope....a God you could believe in and depend on.    Dependability on the "old Gods" was wearing very thin.    Christianity was taking a very strong hold in Ireland by the 5th century A.D. and there were already believers in Ireland AND England LONG before then....both of which had a strong Scandinavian (Norwegian, Danish, etc)  influence. Some legends has Christianity in England as early as the year of Jesus' crucifixion.    It had even a much earlier STRONG influence in Greece, what was to become France and Spain, Southwestern Russia, and Egypt and Ethiopia within as early as the year of the crucifixion of Jesus and in full swing in less than 100 yrs.|`|UxooffHZaa	The final country in Europe to abandon their gods was Lithuania. Germany did when Charlemagne took over, and committed genocide on all the Pagan Germans, unless of course they converted to Christianity. All of this occured between say the years 800 and 1300. Christianity spread from the South of Europe upwards.|`|NOgOdT7saa	I don't know about Norway, but as for Greece and Rome, their Gods got diminished officially when the Roman Empire collapsed in the 6th century. Previously, Christianity had been popular as well in Italy and the fall of the Roman Empire helped kick Christianity into it's seat of power held throughout the Middle Ages. When the Roman Empire fell, a new empire was created by Charlamagne (I think), the Holy Roman Empire. The Holy Roman Empire and Catholic Church ruled and was the only established "government" in the Middle Ages all until the Reformation started by Martin Luther in the 17th century. So, throughout Europe, the time when Christianity was prominent was the 6th-17th century and even still on.|`|sODHwf1Maa	It is generally said that Norway had become a Christian after the Battle at Stiklestad in 1030. People started converting maybe 200 years prior to this point, but after 1030 there would not be many still worshipping the old gods, only in isolated islands across the Kingdom.

CMYK stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and blacK  they are the four colours used in 4 colour process printing  the standard for most printing. RGB Red, Green and Blue are the optical primaries and used for creating colours on screen. Pantone printing colours are standardised around the world and are used for spot colour printing they allow a supplier in one part of the world to send artwork halfway around the world and still be sure that it will look the same when printed.

5M0FBU89aa	I'm the son of a professional photographer.   In fact, if you saw the movies of the Apollo rockets taking off of the lauchpad - well, that was my dad that put them there.    He got a AA degree in fine arts majoring in photography.    He "niched" himself in aerospace.   You will want to do the same.    Equipment is a lot different these days.  You'll need a 15 MP camera and software to create film effects (graininess, ASA, etc.)    Lighting is half of it- it's an art unto itself.    I'm sure you know all this, but it's all I know.       Good luck!

Everywhere in the world is beautiful in its own way. No one wants pictures of Florida they can goto istockphoto and get pictures for 99c.     Like the other guy said get a solid education in the craft and find a niche. Just learning lighting might take you one year. Learning to make pro images people will rehire you to make might take you 5-10 years - got the passion for that?    If you have the passion go and study if you think taking photos for money is fun it can be........

He chose money over marriage when he was younger, and thought it was a wise choice. He didn't know why his nephew married - and especially why he married for love because in society at that time, marriages were most often arranged for financial reasons. Brides had to have a healthy dowry to attract a husband. Scrooge's nephew's wife had no dowry and to Scrooge, that meant he was giving up money, which had been the most important thing in Scrooge's life.   What Scrooge saw was the loving relationship between his nephew and wife - a relationship that was generous enough to send kindly thoughts to a miserly old lman like himself.|`|92TkCzXkaa	Scrooge was in love when he was younger. But he chose money over love.   When the ghost of Christmas past takes him back Scrooge sees his sister and how happy she was with family at Christmas time, the girl he was in love with pleading with him to chose her over money, and then he saw her again older sitting across from her daughter

He, is, in effect, eating away at himself.  The meal is neither satisfying nor is it sustaining, hence the man grows thinner, not necessarily in the literal sense, but spiritually.  We've all dealt with people who are unable to handle the success of others- some become bitter, others intensely competitive, or spiteful.  Horace is commenting on the negative nature of envy and how its effects can truly sour the soul.
haapeymNaa	Well, practicing your splits is a very good start.  Any time you're watching TV, reading, whatever, sit on the floor in a split while you're doing it.  The more time you spend in a flexibility position, the more flexible you will get, slowly but surely.  For leaps, hold your core (stomach muscles) as tightly as you can, it will give you more balance and power in your leaps and it also works great for turns.      I wish you the best in your tryout.

I still haven't quite worked out the knack yet!|`|5CoJZut4aa	A trill in any music is the rapid succession of notes. There are different types depending on the music but the most common is' tr' if you have one of these on top on a note, say f  that means that you play f   and G repeatedly every quickly. There are others like ones with flat/sharp or lines signs above the tr. But this is the most common.

KAsVj3C0aa	Set your artboard to the exact dimensions. Make sure your table doesn't have anything hanging over the edge of the artboard. Maybe you have a stroke out there?     To ensure that Illustrator doesn't "see" anything outside the artboard for web exporting, create a crop area. Draw a box exactly the size of the arboard, and align to the center of the artboard. With this box selected, choose Object > Crop Area > Make    On the "Save for Web" window there is a Image Size tab on the right. Make sure percent is set to 100. The final image should be 612 x 2880. Check it in Photoshop. This may not be an Illustrator issue.  Where are you uploading it to and what are you using to view it?

ScZPVCUpaa	When I worked in graphic design years ago we used something called zipatone. It came in sheets with different size dots.  I remember cutting it with an exacto knife and then peeling it, I think it was self-adhesive.  I guess you could make your own stencil with a paper punch.  Kind of labor intensive, tho.

BjBkO0CSaa	The 15th Amendment was a huge step in the Civil Rights Movements.    It was one of the 3 "Reconstruction" Amendments (13 ended slavery, 14 defined citizenship and guaranteed equal protection to all).     15 is about voting - the amendment states: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."      While this only applies to African American men, it gives them the right to vote.  It may not seem like a big deal now, but it was huge - it gave African Americans to have a say in how the laws are made and who runs the government (local, state and national).  It gave them the right to fight against the discrimination brought on by white supremacists, but there were drawbacks.      It took a while for African Americans to actually get the right to vote.  White democrats in the South created poll taxes, literacy tests and used the "Grandfather clause" to prevent African Americans from voting.  They also used intimidation tactics, or forced African Americans to vote for Democrats (which was pointless, since it was the Southern Democrats that were racist against the African Americans.)    So as to answer your question, African Americans [men] voted after the ratification of the 15th amendment - but technically, they didn't have the right to vote for a long time (until the "Voting Rights Act of 1965).      Hope that helps, good luck!
rh5vbol9aa	You do not need anybody to improve your poem, you are a talent.|`|QKQBGISKaa	Hi.   Opening, I'll say this is only my opinion.  If you don't agree, please feel free to ignore it.     I think you're trying a little too hard, especially with regard to rhyme and meter.   Sometimes your rhyme seems forced, like in the sixth line where you confound normal grammar in order to achieve your rhyme "find your broken heart a cure" instead of "cure your broken heart."  Additionally, you are writing a poem with a very regimented rhyme and meter, but there are times you break that meter for no apparent reason or where your word choice forces a rhythm that contradicts your meter (possibly because you simply want to fit to many words into the line).  Consider either:  1) abandoning a march-like rhythm, or 2) carefully selecting words and phrases so that they match your poem's rhythm.     I'm not sure whether you meant to do this, but you actually have a sophisticated metaphor building in this poem.  The poem itself, as the song that the narrator of the poem is struggling to write.  It could be interesting to flush out this metaphor a little -- that is -- if in the end, you have a poem that does all the things you want your "song" to do, then you have a successful metaphor.      My advice to you would be this:  don't worry so much about maintaining exact couplets and a sing-songy meter.   Those are very strict, very difficult parameters in which to write something meaningful, and it's little wonder why we praise people like Shakespeare so much who wrote entire plays in iambic pentameter (a specific kind of structural meter).  Instead, concentrate on the feeling that you're trying to express and let the words speak for themselves.      I know that might not be as specific as you are looking for, but poetry isn't a specific medium.  There are innumerable ways to say a thing.  Good luck finding one that feels true to you.
