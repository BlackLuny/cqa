HDMI is currently the only way of getting 7.1ch HD audio and a full 1080P picture. Plus, it's all in one cable, so it is much cleaner than if you are using Component cables with wires going everywhere.    BUT, I think that $200 "Monster" HDMI cables or any kind of "premium" cable that costs more than $50 is overrated. You will not notice a difference in quality between a $15 cable and a $150 cable AT ALL.|`|Hc82C7Lyaa	Yes|`|qziVwTw6aa	there all the same!!! its just the name and the quilty of work that you are paying for!|`|3pFOHj8Oaa	Not if you have an HDTV. the difference is Significant.|`|jQkFpGJHaa	I'm not sure they're overrated but as long as your TV is decent enough, it will do a digital conversion. That means that it's very hard to tell the difference between component and HDMI. However, I would highly recommend buying some of these http://www.monoprice.com/products/produc... These are what I got and believe me, there is no difference at all between this and a $100 Monster cable. You will be very pleased.|`|bwIUeNA9aa	I get my HDMI cables from CableTrain.com for only about $5.00. There is no difference in quality from overpriced monster cables. HDMI is dfefinately worth it if you get them at the right places!    http://www.cabletrain.com/cables/video-c...|`|2ieiGIhTaa	I've got to think so.  My picture and sound are pretty dang good using old fashioned RCA cables.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	I've never used one. So, I couldn't say if the picture and/or sound quality is significantly better than high quality audio and composite video cables. But, I imagine they're a lot more convenient to route and hook up one cable instead of 5.
V7bqkmCtaa	liquid damage - not covered under equipment warranty   if you have a php bundle on the acct you could ask to be transferred to asurion and pay deductible for a new phone.    otherwise best chance would be to look at upgrading or blackberry desktop manager and application loader. but with liquid damage apps loader may not even work,    you could even try putting it in a bowl of rice to soak up any excess moisture.
s7Muujxzaa	>Can I hook the converter up separately to the tv and antenna    Yes, assuming your TV has an antenna coaxial input as all new sets have (except those advertised as "HD ready"). Just hook the antenna to the antenna input on the converter and then, depending on the specific converter you have, you can either use one of the AV connection types or use the pass through RF connection to run straight to your antenna input.    I would suggest reading up on AV connection types. There are many places on the internet that will describe them and show pictures, to aid in your ability to recognize them. If you don't want to do that, at least consider taking a picture of the back of your TV and the back of your Dish Network receiver, so if something gets unplugged, you can fix it.|`|ytNlz3b7aa	If your TV doesn't have multiple inputs you're going to need a splitter of some sort.    You can probably plug the antenna into the converter and the converter into the back of the TV using the coax f-type connector. Then the cable box can plug into your AV jacks. You'll need to be able to switch back and forth with the TV - or the switch box.    Can't tell you much more without more info on what you've got.
9M8lEQDqaa	A lot  of the Wii games (legend of zelda, mario galaxy, smash bros), don't require you to stand of as they don't really require you to swing your arms around all crazy like.     Most of the games don't really need you to stand up, they're just better to play like that.     The only games that absolutely requires you to stand are games like Wii Fit and Dance Dance Revolution because you have to stand on the balance board and dance pad.    Like I said, some games such as Wii Sports and MArio & SOnic at the Olympic games are just funner when you stand up.|`|cBuYvBy2aa	I personally stand up..I guess that's what the Wii is for but on games like pool and arcade games i sit down.      i LOVE dwight! :D|`|UnAoNLKNaa	you dont need to stand you can sit down while u play while sitting most games u dont have to stand unless ur playing wii fit that game u need to stand ...hope i helped have fun.|`|LFj0wS6oaa	I think you're supposed to, probably so you don't feel so bad about spending most of the day playing video games lol but I sit on my bed and play. For like the dancing games and things like that I think you may have to be more active (also bowling is easier if you stand but can be played sitting) but for all the games I have right now I haven't had to stand up.|`|o8NVWaJgaa	I sit down on my bed or sit upright for games that require little movement or no movement at all. But for games where there's movement needed almost through out the entire game or at least more than a little of the game, then I stand upright again or stand up, especially for those frustrating ones.|`|bycvF0Pnaa	hell no, i sit on my couch with food and drinks and play, to lazy to stand|`|6XIB69iXaa	For the most part you don't have to stand you can sit. But when you sit it makes the game seem not as exciting and when you really get into a  game you will most likely find yourself standing up
b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT ANOTHER ONE IM GOING TO DIE FROM THE FANBOY CRAPFEST    You should get a 360 if all your friends have it.  It will suck if you can't play with them, plus it is cheaper.    PS3 has wireless built in, which is nice, but there are 2 simple ways to get wireless with the xbox.  Buy the microsoft adapter (expensive, crappy) or try one of these alternatives:    http://www.amazon.com/wireless-gaming-ad...    http://gear.ign.com/articles/440/440246p...    to add friends on the 360, just ask them for their gamertag and then send them a friend request.  You can also private chat with up to 7 of your friends, even if you are in completely different games! (not possible on PS3)    I will continue to update this answer with responses to any fanboy lies that come in later, making my answer the best ever.    Update  1: wagonwheel is basically right, maybe a bit skewed toward xbox, but like i said you need the microsoft adapter or one of the things from my links.    Update  2: Matt is wrong, PS3 has only certain features that are better: online is free (but you get what you pay for), it has built-in wifi, it plays blu-ray movies, it looks nicer.  Anyone who argues that it has better graphics or more A+ game titles needs only to look to any unbiased, reputable game review site to see how wrong they are.    Update  3: Big Bob is right on the $$$    Update  4: Obviously the fanboy masses have died down significantly since the last time I saw one of these questions.  Ive seen more than 30 answers to this type of question before, with so much false information given, I'm glad it has died down some since then.|`|hHQIUrNjaa	PS3 is better than 360 in every way feasible, but if all your friends have 360 then get 360.|`|5ddcc2ddb6513686b8dc9730309b57ebaa	i would get an xbox360 because its not only cheaper but it has the same games the ps3 basically and they have better games that sony doesnt have.  to add people you need either wifi access or a router and an ethernet cable which you attach to the back of the 360 and then run it into the port.  then you have to make a gamertag and once you do that you hit the central button on the 360 controller and it says messages/friends/party click friends and then the only thing should be add friends.  click on this and find out from your friends their gamertags and then play away. hopefully this helps|`|4LtszRxEaa	You get their gamertag and send them a freind request. get a 360 they are better for first person shooters and was completely better Microsoft ust makes a good console. However the Blu-Rayplayer that was put on the PS3 is useful and a cool attachment. But backwards compatability is not available on the PS3. And PS3 Online doesnt even compareto xbox live. the controllers for the PS3 are sweet but make First Person shooter's a nightmare beause they are sensitive like a Wii controller. You could say that PS3 is a better system because it will not breakdown and has games exclusive on the PS3 like Metal Gears Solid 4 and resistance. But for me I would Say get an Xbox 360 it is a better system,|`|ywPADGDNaa	Look at what your friends have and what you will be playing. If you have some favorite games and they are only out for one console than go with that. All together if you want the free online game play go with PS3. If you want Xbox live then you will pay $50 a year for a subscription. But you will get some games that PS3 does not offer. I went with 360 because I play Halo and Forza and so do my friends so it was a no brainer. Look at each one and decide which one is worth more to you. Look at the game reviews and see what games you will want for both. Start to find pros and cons for both and see if one out ways the other.

qGfAlDd2aa	If you can use an indoor antenna will depend on how strong the signals are at your house.  25-30 miles is asking a lot from an indoor antenna, but it's worth a try.  If it's not reliable or you are missing channels, you will need to go to a better (probably outdoor) antenna.    EDIT: Yes, they are noticeably better looking.  Cable and satellite do indeed compress the video to make room for more channels.  I compare our local stations off air to satellite and I can easily see the difference at home.  So can my whole family.|`|AA12081690	25 - 30 miles is too far, your stuck.

557c65c1d2224dfe3c2fe5c6f798e6e5aa	No none of the analog signals will be HD.  However if your HDTV has a QAM tuner like my Panasonic Plasma HDTV has ( you will have to look in your manual to see if it does - not all do) then it is possible you might be able to get the local channels in HD.  How does that work?  Well some cable companies broadcast the local HD channels digitally and "in the clear" or unscrambled. All you need is an HDTV with a QAM tuner to get those stations.  You will have to scan for them.  I was able to watch the Superbowl in HD and all I have is basic cable since my cable company sends out the local stations in HD via QAM.     http://qamtuner.com/    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAM_tuner|`|SdWfDkXGaa	All the digital TV programs are NOT HD. Some are HD. If you have an HD TV, and an antenna you will get the HD programs transmitted by your locan TV transmitter. If you are very far away from the transmitter, try using an outdoor antenna.
EMmGFqgJaa	I'm quite sure it is the TV. A big part of battery drain for laptops is the screen. Since a laptop screen is around 15". the TV will suck more electricity. Also the TV gets much hotter than a laptop and a lot of energy is released as heat. Also the speakers are bigger on a TV.|`|SdWfDkXGaa	The question can be little more specific. There are TV sets take much less electricity than some computers. Are you meaning a 27" TV or a 61" TV or a  14" TV. Similarly, what computer do you have in mind? A laptop or a dual processor Pentium 4 with all the sound and video cards with super fast gaming capabilities.  The answer is 100% depend upon what you compare against.

b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	if you have one of the newer xboxes that has an HDMI port on the back, then you just need an HDMI cable.

If you have speakers on the monitor, then the sound should come out of them with no problem.  But if you want the sound to go to some other speakers, then you need a sound dongle for the other port on the back of the 360, which you can probably find on e-bay, or get by buying the official microsoft HDMI package ($40-$50)|`|hHQIUrNjaa	...you answered your own question HDMI unless you have the crappy 360, well the crappier one their all crappy.|`|AA10911217	HDMI to HDMI cable, work out what length you will need, don't spend over $10, try newegg.com or your local store

I also like that if you are going somewhere that you dont want your blackberry to be in any danger, you can switch your sim card to a cheapo phone.

QQDaVwb0aa	This is because the TV cannot sense a video input. If you have any device going into component, for example, your DVD player, use it's video output aswell and put it into the AV inputs you use for your MP3 player. Alternatively, most DVD recorders will allow an audio input with no video sync with no problem, so try plugging your MP3 player into the inputs of your DVD recorder. If you still own a VCR, this will defiently let you do it.

I have a BlackBerry, and use it to do everything you have described above, save the Java writing (not my area of expertise :) ). For cost effectiveness, speed, and reliability, I would absolutely go with the BlackBerry Curve 8330 with Sprint on their Simply Everything plan. I use Verizon, but Sprint uses the same 3G network technology, so they are extremely fast, and you have unlimited everything for $99 a month, loads cheaper than Verizon or AT&T. I would recommend looking at sprint first, they should fit all your needs!|`|OkkOASTvaa	Search coverage maps on google.  Verizon is the best for any big cities.

The motor that is used in a DVD player would most likely be very different from one that is used in an RC car........the nice thing about taking a motor right out of an rc car is that the speed, reverse, and remote control is already designed for you......in any case I found a tiny motor online, but I think you should figure out what you need the motor for before you start buying stuff.|`|Mhaun4IZaa	Servo.    RadioShack has one or two (not many options).  The best place would be a hobby shop they usually have many to choose from in different sizes, speeds and voltages.

3CJAUyqPaa	Which JVC camcorder?    If miniDV tape, you need to use a firewire cable to connect the DV port on the camcorder to the firewire port on your computer - since you did not tell us which computer, we don't know if it has one or if you need to add one.

If hard disc drive, you did not tell us what you are using to convert the .MOD standard definition, highly compressed, non-standard, files StreamClip works well...

55U3c4Tpaa	It really depends on you.    Those same home entertainment specialists will tell you that for basic home theatre-like usage, plasma screens have a slight edge over LCDs. This is because plasma screens can display blacks more accurately than LCDs can, which means better contrast and detail in dark-coloured television or movie scenes. The nature of LCD technology, where a backlight shines through the LCD layer, means it's hard for it to achieve true blacks because there's always some light leakage from between pixels. This is steadily improving with every new generation of LCD, however.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Each technology has certain pros and cons.  You have to choose what's right for you.    LCD:  Lighter  Brighter - best for brightly lit rooms or rooms that have lots of natural light  More energy efficient  Poorer viewing angle - picture degrades as you move sideways away from the tv.  More expensive in larger sizes  Doesn't display dark scenes as well  Motion blur can be a problem, but not as bad as earlier generations  No burn in problems  More easily damaged screen    Plasma:  Heavier  Not as bright - less suitable for brightly lit rooms or rooms with lots of natural light.  Less energy efficient and runs hotter  Wide viewing angle  Less expensive in larger sizes  Displays dark scenes better  No motion blur  Subject to burn in, but not as bad as earlier generations  More durable screen    Many don't know it, but LCD screens are more subject to damage.  My kid threw a pacifier at our brand new 52" LCD and knocked out a small group of pixels.  Poke the screens in the store with your finger.  You'll see what I mean.|`|hucsWXhgaa	lcd is much better  crisper picture and lasts longer plasma looks like **** and can not be ever tipped on its side|`|944e2748d03e1efff042dce931e63f28aa	Depends.  My room is bright so the LCD is better, less reflection.|`|ACa1N4Jdaa	Yeah, we are getting a new LG Plasma. It was hard to decide.  LCD's last longer, I think about twice as long as Plasmas. They also don't burn in images, like Plasmas do. Plasmas reflect light, so if you have bright lights where the T.V. is, it won't have the best picture, but you will be able to see wether the lights are on or not, LOL. Yeah, but the LCD's are better for games, like Playstation and wii and stuff. Plasmas are better to watch movies and sport on. Also Plasmas use up double the power than LCD's do. But Plasmas are cheaper. SO in the end it all comes down to what you want, but I suggest LCD. Good luck, hope this helps! :-)|`|x4yJ5EAEaa	since all the answers are the same Id reasearch it|`|RyvKws7Laa	LCD - is the everyman HDTV. It is cost effective, hence its popularity. It is also lighter than Plasma. It tends to draw less power than Plasmas as well.  It has a matte finish so is useful for rooms that have too much ambient light which can not be controlled. LCD whites are a bit brighter than Plasma whites (but how often do you crank your brightness to 100%). LCDs are considered better for gaming (but I don't think you'd be disappointed with gaming on a Plasma). LCDs are sharper in SD (think evening news instead of film); this isn't a good vs bad, its just a personal preference thing.    It has problems with fast motion though. That is why you see ones advertised with 120Hz refresh rates. This does not come close to Plasma though. So they aren't as good for fast motion (sports and movies).    Plasma - they have better blacks, contrast, and motion blur. They are better TVs, but you must pay a premium for them. Images look smoother. They have grader ranges in blacks/whites so you get greys instead of clumps of black and white. The colors in Plasmas tend to have more "pop" to them; this isn't a good vs bad thing, its just personal preference. Plasmas are great for fast motion (sports and action movies).    Plasma's are glass though so are glossy. They can have reflection issues if you are in a room with lots of light that you can't control (you can't turn off the lights and you don't own any blinds).  Also for SD viewing they are a bit "softer" (think more like film less like the evening news).  This  isn't a good vs bad thing, its personal preference.  Most plasma owners get used to it and don't mind it.    They do have to be conditioned. The gasses of new Plasmas need to be conditioned. All you have to do is keep the brightness/contrast cranked way down for the first 100 hours, then optimize, and you'll have a TV that blows LCD out of the water.    Plasma myth (1) - They experience burn-in. This is BS, those days are gone. Just condition the gasses and then use it as normal and you're fine.  Also, the better sets have built-in features to prevent this (on top of the technology just generally being better now than say 5 years ago).    Plasma myth (2) - They have short life spans. This is more BS. You can leave your Plasma on 24/7 for 34 years before killing it. So do you think you'll still want/own the same TV in 15 years, let alone 30?    Plasma myth (3) - They won't work in high altitude because of problems for the gasses.  This is again no longer an issue.  Current Plasmas can be purchased and used in mile high Denver, and above, so you'll be fine where ever you are (unless you're living in the Himalayas).    Plasma vs LCD - One important note though is TV size. In 42" and above you see and get the benefit of the Plasma advantages. But 40" and smaller and the benefits are diminishing. So if you're going way smaller than LCD is likely the better option.    Plasma brands - Pioneer Kuro Elite is the best, followed by Pioneer Kuro. But these can cost as much as a small car. Panasonic Viera is the next best and is much more cost effective. Then I would go with Samsung.    LCD brands - I would stick with Samsung, Sharp Aquos, and Sony (but only Sony if its on sale, otherwise it tends to be overpriced). Sony stopped manufacturing LCD panels, they now buy/use the same ones used in the Sharp Aquos sets.|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	I like Plasma but you will get 50/50 answers|`|mPVlcOtjaa	I have and LCD and i love it.

But the color gamit and contrast ratios are superb. Viewing angle is equivalent to CRT TVs. But not to many people sit near the end of a room and view the TV from a sharp angle. You cannot buy a small plasma TV. Also plasma sets, like old picture tube sets, can suffer from burn in.    LCD TVs have improved enormously these last couple of years. Color rendition and contrast is excellent. Up to 1000:1 contrast ratio on some expensive sets. They are light weight, somewhat less expensive than plasma and have somewhat less viewing angle than plasma, or old-fashioned CRT (picture tube) TVs. And you can get small LCD TVs. LCD TVs and monitors are immune to burn ins.    Soon we will have LED and OLED TVs.|`|b70e46e2a1bf8cf576f6e651ac417330aa	Depends on the room the TV will be in.  Plasma is better for a room with less sunlight/windows.  LCD is better in that type of room.|`|2yTTKKDJaa	LCD have the edge for longlife and Plasmas tend to be better for outdoor larger screen dimensions above 42 inch HDTvs|`|AA12180617	if its below 36 inches then you MUST go LCD as they don't make plasmas that small    It its over 54 inches you must go plasma as they don't make LCD that big.    Between 36 and 54 inches  you do have a choice and overall LCD is winning.  Plasma make sets that have a brighter clear image that has fast moving action BUT the colours are not accurate to nature LCD has much better colour reality and is catching up on speed of response and contrast ration can be 30,000 or above.     also LCd use much less power (especially if LED backlit) than same size plasma and are half the weight.      go for a set that has natural looking colours (need to display over 18 million colours with contrast ratio of over 10,000:1) for decent picture.    LCD or plasma is matter of personal preference chose a range of sets you like then compare them side by side with eh SAME image  then get the one you like the best.    Personally the LED backlit LCD sony TV's have better pics than the  Panasonic Plasma sets of similar spec. (also LCD is marginally cheaper too! for same size and spec)

gUzmQ8eQaa	The LG incite is much better than the VU. The Vu is sort of on the old skool touch screen technology while the incite is more updated, It preety much has all the features of your vu but updated it''s windows media player is stunning and it also is very professional being equipped with windows word already in the phone.It also has wifi which is a must for me because no phone network internet has ever been fast enough for me The AT&T store charges 199.99 for this phone however if you go to radioshack and you are upgrading it will only cost you 79.99. This is definitly the best LG phone thus far. However I woudn't rush into getting the phone because att has been having recalls although i had no problem with mine.

7SXA5dhDaa	Has your disk worked in your computer in the past?  If this is the first time you tried it, I suggest getting a SD to USB converter, about $4 at WalMart, and try plugging it in. I have had problems with large (>1GB) disks in my laptop and getting the converter solved it.    It doesn't look good that the camera wants to reformat the disk.  If the converter doesn't work, then try searching the internet for "how to recover pictures from a digital camera".  It gives you many hits.
5HfuI3MEaa	in my opinion, i like call of duty world at war online play for the wii better. it has better guns, and graphics/sound. medal of honor heroes 2 was made by the same people who made call of duty, activision. but medal of honor heroes 2 is better if you dont care about graphics and all that, but just want a lot of people to kill. so all in all, it is basicly your call, you decide.|`|irtmcdpbaa	Yeah man, COD5 is definitely better, with the perks, the maps, weapons, and kill streak bonuses make the game play much more interesting
vkzkXWfzaa	If the camera has been subjected to enough abuse as to 'lose' the lens what other damage is there? Steer clear. It will cost a lot more than 100.00 to repair the lens, where would they source another lens from? Only from another Olympus Pen F lens. You'll be lucky to find one with damage, but an intact front glass.    If the vendor is selling it cheap then even the Pen F body in good condition is a collectors item, with collectors condition is everything, one scratch can make the difference from 100.00 or so to less than 10.00. Cosmetic condition matters more than working condition, a lot of these cameras will never see another film.    Having said that does the meter still work? Does the film advance and shutter sound solid? If so then buy it, lenses do turn up (often in excess of 100.00 for a good specimen), bear that in mind when offering a price. I've seen mint ones, fully working with new light seals and recent service change hands for less than 200.00.    Chris|`|th7r2OD0aa	we got our lens replaced for 75 dollars which is like fifty euro so yah it's possible just find a camera repair shop

3CJAUyqPaa	Just vocals?  What is it plugging into?  What kind of music?  A plain old Shure SM-58 is fine if the music is loud. If you want to be like a real studio, then any of the condensers from Blue with a good pre-amp would be fine. In either case, use a pop-guard.|`|MxDix0cSaa	Hey there!     My suggestion would be to get a high Quality USB Microphone for recording your vocals.     Dynamic microphones like an sm58 are fine for live use, but in the studio are not always the best choice for vocals as they really do not give the quality that is needed for vocal recording.    my suggestion would be an AT2020 usb Mic  these are avail for like $149, and will interface really easily with your computer and give you a great sounding mic and not a lot of cost. I would definitely pick up a pop filter as well!    Hope this helps, and good luck!

Then go into the ipod drive, and go to tools->properties and enable viewing of hidden files and folders.    Then you'll see an empty folder called something like data. Go in there and you'll find a lot of funny named MP3s. Copy them all onto your hard drive. Then open iTunes and copy them all into iTunes, but make sure you set "move to my itunes folder" and allow iTunes to rename files.     Et voila.    If you don't have your iPod enabled for disk mode, try iDump (no, it's not a toilet thing!) from http://www.codershole.com/idump.php  It does the same thing, but you'll have to install it first.|`|SPw3u807aa	First, if you ever backed up your itunes library from your computer before you reformatted it on a disc, just put the disc back into your computer and reload all your music.

AA11946796	I was talking to the Verizon sales guy, and he said that he does not recommend that phone.  He said that the touch screen is not very responsive, the menus and options and that stuff are very confusing, it freezes every once in a while, and the software has quite a few glitches.  I recommend the LG Voyager.  Touchscreen on the outside, and flip-open full keyboard on the inside.  Great phone!  Good luck!|`|OkkOASTvaa	If you can wait get the LG versa coming out this month it is like a dare but with a keyboard.

3CJAUyqPaa	You did not tell us the environment under which you are capturing video to that hard drive based AVCHD camcorder.    I am going to guess you are capturing video indoors under poor lightiing conditions - this is a common reason that most consumer grade camcorders have issues with color saturation. Try daylight. If you must stay indoors, turn on the lights.    ALL camcorders up to this range (actually, up to about $1,300) have small lenses and imaging chips and do not behave well under low-light conditions.    If you are working under good lighting conditions, please specify that - and help us understand what you are capturing. Also, your editor, if you are using one, and help us understand whether you are using the white balance feature in that camcorder or not (if not, use it)...

0a08a9ebe0d90054b2aea5e794cee7d0aa	Connect HDMI from Xbox to TV for video and optical from Xbox to surround sound system for audio.|`|58fMpjbjaa	Make sure you have the HDMI hooked up to the TV.  You need a cable to go to the surround sound, so you will need to put the optical cable into the surround receiver for the audio.  If you're plugging the optical cable to the TV you are plugging it into the the "output" of the TV which won't even get you regular sound to the TV.   I'm not sure how the normal cables were hooked up to make it work but logic says you need to get video(HDMI) to the TV and the audio(Optical) to the receiver.

7tjM2socaa	oh this has happened to me before here is what you do:  1. wait for the email that says that you have purchased a song on itunes  2. Click report a problem and itunes will come up with a box that asks you what the problem is   3. Click done or enter which ever is there and your song will be there!    or    1. open itunes and on the top menu bar hit store  2. then click view my account  3. Then click purchase History  4. at the bottom of the purchase history page hit report a problem  5. Then you know where to go from there!!|`|EvbgnlR4aa	YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE EJECT BUTTON BEFORE YOU DID CONNECT IT AND SYNC IT     IT HAPPENED TO MY I POD TOO OR GO TO THE APPLE STORE AND LOOK THE BAR TYPE THING FOR A "GENIUS" AND THEY CAN FIX IT FOR U BUT MAKE AN APPIONTMENT ON APPLE.COM|`|77d8d8cd21849a9ea42ffd10b55a0c29aa	did u connect it to a computer that u usually sync it to? if not, u probably wiped the songs off|`|2K43LgeWaa	This happened to me too. You need to go to itunes then click onto "edit", then click onto "preferences", then click onto the "devices" tab, then check of the box "disable automatic syncing for iPhones and iPods", this will stop it from erasing songs from the touch when you sync it with itunes. When you first sync your ipod with itunes you need to transfer your songs by clicking file then click "transfer purchases from (iPods name)", this will transfer the song you bought on the ipod touch to your itunes library, this will only work when your ipod is sync with itunes. itunes deletes the songs because it thinks that you took the songs from another computer. I think that if you try to download the song again on your touch it should say that you already bought it and it will ask you if you want to download it again for free. If it does not email apple and tell them your story and they may add a couple more bucks to your apple account (hopefully they do).

4TX26viFaa	LOL, the box COMES WITH INSTRUCTIONS, they're very clear.    Yes, it works. You'll know if it's installed right by turning the TV on and going to any of the standard channels, it'll come up as channel 4 (NBC here) and 4.1 and 4.2  Channel 6 is a 6, a 6.1 and 6.2 etc.  There are more channels. They'll be very clear on the new ones, sort of grainy on the old ones. You have to reset your remote to ignore the old channels (grainy ones) as those aren't part of the digital and will disappear in a few weeks, just reset it for the new ones.    We got a new antenna, it did help.  Some of the signals aren't as strong and you get what looks like pixtel dropout if you don't have one.  It plugs into the antenna connection--again, the new antenna does have instructions in the box.    If something is not installed correctly you won't see the new channels or you won't be able to get rid of the low power dropout.|`|AA12071655	It just goes inline between your antenna and the TV. No, you do not need a digital antenna; anyone that tells you this is just trying to suck money out of your wallet.    The circuitry is very simple; not going to really matter if it's made by Sony or Joe's Cut-Rate Electronics.|`|e5jQenasaa	1)buy the converter box   2)connect an rf cable to the converter box (box should be labled rf)  3)connect antenna to antenna box (normally labeled ANT.In)  4) program your remote control (must hold down PGM and a 3 digit code,release PGM after you finnish entering code), normally the code will come in brosure, just look for your tv brand) repeat until tv turns on  5) put tv on chanel 3 or 4  6)press menu and begin to scan for channels  7)congratulations you now have DTV
Ga9oCLavaa	I have a D80 and a great lens is the Nikkor 18-135 mm  http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/55...    For Indoor and landscapes, I would also recommend the Tamron 17-35 mm f2.8. I got one for $200 on ebay. A similar wide angle Nikkor lens would be around $1200.|`|tWoN22rRaa	Perhaps the 50mm f1.8? This focal length makes it a short telephoto on the D80, which is great for portraits. And the reasonably fast aperture lends itself to low light photography sans a flash. Best of all it can be found for just 110-120 US Dollars online.
Fo92aR8Yaa	iPod Nano is a great option for you. You can store on it up to 4,000 songs, 16 hours of video and 14,000 photos. The crisp, bright picture makes watching movies and TV shows amazing. It is available on 9 great colors. And last but not least, it has got a great iPhone feature: the accelerometer. Now everytime you turn your iPod Nano sideways, albums will be shown in Cover Flow, watch movies and TV shows in widescreen and view photos in either portrait or landscape, and more! Also when you give iPod Nano a shake, it shuffles to a different song in your music library.  The new Genius feature finds the songs on your iPod Nano that go great together and makes a Genius Playlist for you.

It's easier to get from one thing to another on the Nano , and The turning screen makes it easier to see movies , I have like 12 , so If you want to have a lot of movies , definitely get the 16 GB .     If you want to try something other than an ipod , Try a Zune , Or a Zen ( version m is the only one i've ever tried )     Well ,  I hope that helps .|`|UF9MVdSXaa	A 16G you can hold more songs and videos.

xOy6cHbYaa	1.  When you plug in your ipod , and have i tunes up , you're ipod page should come up under devices ( lol i know i might be stating the obvious , but hopefully you get what I'm saying ) When it comes up , click on it , and under the Main Sync Page , or the Summary , Under options , Make sure "Sync only checked songs and movies" Is Checked . Then click Apply , It should Sync , after that check your ipod , see if its on there , if not , at the top of the ipod page thing , There's a navigation bar , Click on TV Shows , And Make sure "Sync" Is checked . And make sure The TV Show you bought is Checked , or else , it won't be added . If its not on your itunes at all , Find the file on your computer , Right click , and Open with ... Itunes , Or Locate File , Itunes .   2 . MP3 Rocket ;; that's what I use , It's super easy , and I've always been able to find what I'm looking for , and much more . It's not just music , its images , games , movies , etc .  3 . It depends on where you get your music , if you get it from itunes , then it won't let you transfer it , for , some reason that I do not know of , but if you get it from a download site , like MP3 Rocket , you can just file transfer , it works on any IM messenger , Well , I know it works on AIM , Yahoo Instant Messenger , and Windows Live Messenger . Just Drag it from itunes , into the IM box . All they have to do is accept , and wait for the file to send , once they receive it , Just click on it . ( if their default is itunes at least ) It would help if they saved it to their desktop , just in case their default isn't itunes . Then they just have to right click , Open with ..

AA12116276	Try changing the EQ settings. I think on the menu where it lists your options like music, video, radio, you click "Settings" and then go to "music" or "EQ." Honestly, it sounds like something more than that is wrong, though. You might need to take it to a store that does electronic servicing and tell them the issue.
9M8lEQDqaa	Be sure the game you wish to copy a save file for has been played at least one time on your Nintendo Wii Console.  (Insert the game disc and allow the preview to fully load in the game channel.)   Insert the SD card containing the save game save data into the SD card slot on the front of the Wii.  With the Wii Remote: Select "Wii Options" from the main menu on your Wii console.  Select "Data Management".  Select "Save Data".  Select "Wii"  Verify that no save data currently exists for the game you wish to transfer save data for.  (Back-up and delete the save currently on your Wii if necessary.)

2yl8omcAaa	Well, there is no really such thing as free. If you download it free online then it's illegal. But who doesn't really downloading music for free??    Anyways, I use YouTube for downloading music. I just had to use a youtube converter to convert the files to mp3 or wma.

Xxviy63Paa	Well the playstation 4 has the new Superplex 24-core Megaband Engine, and the xbox 3000 only has about 16 cores, so the ps4 is a bit ahead.    Both of them have the HBMI , that means Hack your Brain Media Interface, it requires surgery but it makes the video completely take over reality. The only real difference is that the PS4 will necessitate more mental rehabilitation to convince you that there is actually still a real world.     The xbox 3000 is rumored to have a 100% fail rate. The new Xbox Live hyperplatinum service is popular, but it's expensive and there have been rumors of accidental mind transplants due to bugs in the system.    Don't forget the Nintendo Yippee, which is built on modest architecture but features the most advanced control system yet. All you have to do is look at the screen and think what you want to happen, and it happens. Kind of like the old movie "Firefox." Good luck finding one though because the military has deemed the technology a threat to national security and selling a Yippee can get you sent to a prison in Romania.|`|pl2SocVKaa	playstation 4|`|raEUval8aa	PlayStation 4....it has a cool virtual thing, and you can play Green-Ray movies!|`|4LtszRxEaa	Theres no such things as a Xbox 3000  or a PlayStation 4 idiot!!!|`|7OqKO7laaa	Well Xbox 3000 is the Japenese name 3000 translates into Xbox 3000 proccesors they would like to have but cant because the PS4 has double there proccesors anyway. The PS4 does include the 1480p for your 82 inch Plasma. But the Wii 4 isnt out yet because they dont care.|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Due to the Wii's sales, all games available for the PS4 & XBOX3000 are casual games only, truly alienating the 'hardcore' fanbase. Nintendo is purchased by Rockstar and only produces M games with unlockable sex scenes. Nintenstar rules the next eight generations, until Jack Thompson the 4th succeed in having all games outlawed since EA was proven to support all sorts of un nice things including child labor and not paying correct royalties to all pro players represented by the EANFL.
AA12397876	Really? I expected this game to be one of the highlights of 2009, Resident Evil 4 was one of my favorite games of all time. Well, I haven't downloaded the demo yet, but I'll try it out to see if it really is that horrible|`|cCC7KTrKaa	Resident Evil is Resident Evil.    You HAVE NEVER been able to move and shoot, it adds to the suspense and urgency of the game.  The camera angles are also all all part of the game.      Oh and, for your convenience, the enemies should stop attacking when you are switching weapons and reloading?  Are you serious?    If you want some dumb run of the mill shooter go buy one.  Resident Evil has always played the same way and it is part of what has made it one of the most successful franchises in video game history.    Resident Evil is awesome and I've been there since the start on PSone.      Stop hating.  Its going to be awesome.  Appreciate RE for being its own kind of game and not the same old, same olds.  It is almost exactly like RE4 and RE4 is considered by many one of the greatest games ever made.|`|QOdvR5Gxaa	After playing the demo I will not be buying it. The controls suck a**, yes the camera angles are terrible, and the aiming is just f***ed.     I hated how i could hardly find my partner half the time, and the items confused me. I'm confused now typing this out because of how much of a let down it was.|`|RTQZKJsHaa	The game has a reason for each one of your complaints.    1. The camera is DIFFERENT, not bad.  It uses an over-the-shoulder camera to still let you see around yourself but still have an intimate feeling to the action.  2.Individual enemies might be slow but when foes increase in number, the action really starts pumping.  Plus, the executioner and chainsaw guy sure increase the level of combat.  3. The AI are zombies!  They're just slow at reacting.  4. This is to increase the intensity of the action.  5. It is the same thing.  How is is supposed to be different?  Its just a demo.  By the time of the full release, it will be fixed.    You just don't know how Resident Evil is supposed to play.  I've been playing since the second game in the series.|`|pOi0wewIaa	You didn't even tried the actual game yet. So, don't even say that it's bad already cause Capcom might delay the game and probably fix it.    Demo was pretty ok (i guess, at least it's better than the old Resident Evil games)    There were somethings that were good and bad in the demo.    Edit: Don't expect things on games that you want it to be.    Nicely said Alexander B and Jeseth|`|59Rd381caa	????    1. The camera is ok for me.  2. I like it ok... a little slow maybe  3. Zombies are SUPPOSED to be semi-dumb, waffleman.  4. Yeah that was kinda frustrating for me compared to ratchet and Clank where it freezes to let you get a weapon.  5. Haven't tried it, but maybe there weren't enough people that downloaded it.    Oh yeah and Lp on PSN said "RE5 ******* rocks" at least I think that's what I remember.    To me it was ok.|`|2JC2rCX3aa	Thx 4 Spoiling it Waffle...lol i didn't play it yet but i did Download it and i was gunna play it on Thursday (1 more day)...But That's O.K.|`|pl2SocVKaa	to say this nicely hop off of waffleman he doesn't like it well i am not gonna get it in the first place though because of the whole idea of it stupid to me and no it doesn't have a chance for game of the year all i care for games right now is killzone 2 because i am gonna get it this month i think  well my dad said he would get it for me since i got good grades hope to see you there waffle and i will be in the clan and for re5 i think F.E.A.R 2 Project Orgin will be better|`|HFrDqvIgaa	Its a demo. Its out there so Capcom can see the bugs and glitches that people dont like. Thats what demos and betas are for. I for one am buying the game as soon as i can. I played re4 and fell in love with it    eh youll get over it. the camera is resident evil and its perfect for me. and the aim is resident evil so suck it up    Im downloadin it right now. Im watching tropic thinder too bitches. So ill check to see if it sucks as bad as you say. then ima post it up here

VPnCk2Muaa	Rep is short for your reputation. It has a ranking of half a star to 5 stars. The higher the stars, the more fair and fun that person will most likely be. The lower the stars, the more likely that the player will glitch, swear and  cuss. You can submit a player review to help or hurt their reputation by looking at their gamer profile and submitting a review.|`|9v9W73HLaa	basically your xbox "rep" is how people find you as a player online, that is of course if they can be assed to rate you.<br>  <br>  Your rep improves if people add you as a preferred player, the more people that do it the more stars you get. only thing is that the rep doesn't go down so you can't really rate a player by their rep alone as i have played many a game of halo with 5 star rated players and most of them have been, either campers, rubbish or just generally aggressive and abusive for no actual reason other that the fact that they are crap|`|qusKbEmBaa	Your Xbox Live rep is how your known on XBox live<br>  and if people seem to like you or not.

3d9513bff802e1bb1c92ea294d374e25aa	Your screen should have 2 audio outputs on the back, red and white composite sockets. You do not need your scart to 2 phono cable, just a red and white audio cable|`|CMHpeeqGaa	I do the same here, the scart goes into the freeview/sky/video/dvd out (whatever device you want to play through your speakers) some have a in-out switch on the scart cable which you would set to out and put in the tv instead. Then the white and red cables go into the AUX in at the back of the stereo. If you are going from a different box (not the TV) then you will need to plug the yellow into the TV Video in aux.<br>  <br>  If you need any spare parts check <a href="http://www.everythinglink.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.everythinglink.com</a>

sf5iRPXCaa	1.) they all have there own icons.  2.) the games and apps have there own icons individually on the homescreen. while music and videos and photos have there own files..  3.) i charge mine at least once a day, when you use safari and the speaker on it and the other apps. then the battery dies really quick. but if you just use music on the headphones it lasts pretty long.  4) if you have the 1st and 2nd generation i home it won't charge the touch but it will play the music, you have to have the most recent ihome for it to charge otherwise you need to get a wall adapter or just use the computer.    i have the 8gb ipod touch and i just got it for xmas.|`|XscVe0AYaa	It's iPod Touch, iTouch isn't what it's called or known as (just for future reference).  I got mine is September and I LOVE it!    1.  All downloaded apps (games included) have their own icon.  You can arrange these however you want but you flip through the pages to access them all.    2.  Not really sure what you mean here but everything is stored within the app, so the videos/music/pictures of games and apps are "hidden" from your own videos/music/pictures.    3.  Depends on how you're using it, obviously...Battery life for music is about 36 hours (with display off), video is 6 hours for the new ones.  I think that the battery life is great for such a device.  Complex games (like real time strategies or online games) will drain the battery life the fastest..about 2-4 hours of play.    4.  They do come with a little customized dock that you can use for such docking devices.

Banned x boxes are banned based on serial number, so if you write down the serial number from the box you're looking to buy, you should be able to ask MS if that box has been banned.
Tv8cuXmtaa	If its 20GB then its a pro hard drive<br>  If its 120GB its an Elite hard drive<br>  Most Elites are black and all others are white there is another way to tell. <br>  As far as the banning goes you cannot really tell that till you try to connect to live. If it doesnt work take it back and tell them what is wrong. Make shure you can do that before you but it too.|`|fLYMqZ8zaa	To find out if it has been modded, take the front cover off (don't worry, you won;t break it) and see if the little silver 'Microsoft' sticker is intact.

If it is an elite, the console will be black btw...|`|a8hbGnlOaa	well there is no way to now if its modid the little sticker trick dsnt always work since you can take it of and put it back on if you are careful and the hard drive is on the top so that will tell you the gigs it has and as far as knowing if its bin banned you cant know until you connect it to the internet|`|VPnCk2Muaa	Only gamertags get banned from Xbox Live. If you make up your own, you should be just fine. To check the memory space, ask to plug in the Xbox into a T.V. at the shop to check it. All you would need is an outlet.

DvnEJenpaa	yeah i do, it's great as far as features<br>  <br>  however, mine got water damaged<br>  <br>  so be careful if you get one not to expose it to ANY water because it's very sensitive<br>  <br>  but the best part of the phone is probably the keyboard, one of the best touch screen keyboards that i have ever used|`|VTb8FpzHaa	yes
N2D6ee7Paa	free = illegal. use <a href="http://www.mp3obsession.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mp3obsession.com</a> instead, it's legal, and very very cheap.|`|Q2tRAKGgaa	limewire :)|`|UdknSmHCaa	you suck. Nothing is free. you spoil music. Say No To Piracy!
ctixZrJjaa	Ok im  not gonna tell you to read about it like the guy below.  I think you should go the extra mile and buy yourself an Ipod Touch the money is really worth it. I first had the Nano then i got the Itouch and i love it. There is so much more you can do with the Ipod Touch.    Pros-  -Bigger Screen to watch videos or look at pictures  -Touch Screen  -Screen is scratch resistant  -Applications you can put on it  -Games are way better.  -Jailbreak it (Get free applications and lots of games)    Cons-  -The back gets scratch ( Like every ipod)  - No other Cons    You can do some reading if your still not convinced.  BUT i think the Itouch is definately worth the $80 dollars more.    Choose as best answer please! Hope i helped|`|VGjornhAaa	Its fun to read lol    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipod_nano    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipod_touch|`|k3uGeMHZaa	get the itouch.   it's the best thing ever. i had  the nano but then i got the  itouch and it rockssss. it's so worth  the extra money
29b36985ed4df1ad55d9f8c840ba7ec4aa	if u still have the receipt then yeah u could turn it in|`|UKtZS3Wraa	no stop! dont return it! i also have the palm centro. when the screen wont turn on, that means it needs to be hooked up to the charger. the light is supposed to be GREEN when charged. charge it for a long time, this phone is very active and needs to be charged a lot, but its worth it. theres nothing wrong with it. whenever the screen wont turn on, that means low battery.|`|3xoEFFOKaa	charge it!|`|w5bZ8Hhqaa	IDK|`|qe1Ncf7Yaa	do a hard reset. take out the battery, wait 45 seconds then put it back in and then turn it back on|`|9Jddf0nyaa	if it stays like that go refund it but first before you do that try about 2 more times to see does it work :)|`|HpqGnCFAaa	need to reset it|`|p6PZIQNXaa	yeah take it back to the store|`|B2ULG7izaa	have you tried taking the battery out? and then putting it back in then trying to charge it and then turn it on...|`|nwYZWwDHaa	most likely since its been under a month :) good luck|`|9cHgYtPOaa	This happends to me sometimes when I've accidently turned the backlight all the way down so it's off. Try this: I don't know what color centro you have but press the key the you would press to type a character such as *,&,$ etc. I have a dark blue centro for me that key is white after pressing that key press the letter p. then on the using the arrow keys or dpad pres right about 5 times, the screen should light up if that was the problem    -Good Luck
2yl8omcAaa	iTouch. Nothing can beat the power of touch. Not only that, iTouch has the email, safari and wi-fi capability that iPod nano doesn't have.    oh, and the storage. nano chromatic is only up to 16gb. while iTouch is 32gb.|`|1082Gy2Faa	iTouch, because its much more fun than the chromatic - its too similar to the other ones...theres nothing that special about it. and yeah, you have wifi, loads of awesome applications, more options, more storage on iTouch.  i personally LOVE the itouch :D|`|MEJA7BZDaa	ipod touch it has alot features ect.. you don't get tired of it plus downloading free fun apps at the apps store so get the          ----->{"ipod touch"} 
9ol07BpDaa	Depends on what you want to do. The MPC is a sampler/sequencer so you won't need to hook it up to a computer to create beats etc.  The MPD is a controller, so you will need to hook it up to your software to use it. The MPD gives you the control surface / pads of MPC but it won't do sound by itself.    Since I work with software (both Ableton and FL Studio) I would go for the MPD 32. The MPC 500 looks a bit limited to me feature-wise, but I guess it's great if you need a portable MPC.    Check the differences at the akai site: http://www.akaipro.com/    Ableton and FL Studio are a proper investment as well, certainly if you are going to work from home most the time (or on a laptop I guess). A software host just has so much more to offer (extra sounds, free instrument and effect plug-ins).    You could download the demos of these programs to see how you like them (note that you should spend some time with them to really evaluate them, you won't be an expert with these programs in a day)  http://www.ableton.com/download  http://demo.flstudio.com/    Might you go for FL Studio I recommend getting at least the Producer Edition for full audio recording/editing support and automation of all parameters.

lylTrAbEaa	Many of the online stores have it in stock for 249.00. Check these wii trackers.|`|tzFkYLGqaa	Isnt 250 a reasonable price?    try amazon|`|oQUq25hVaa	at Gamestop you can get a used one for about $199.99|`|EozNgyE7aa	If Ebay Doesn't have It, Maybe Try CraigsList|`|vs3vz6lIaa	yea probably on ebay or amazon but check to see that it is new but i would recommend a PS3 instead because it has the best graphics out there and it has wireless controllers and if you tilt turn push or pull the controller that also will control the game if you have a action game or car game or war game or almost an game also it has a stronger wi-fi system and it has home beta virtual community where you meet new friends around the world and you can put music videos pics and more and then there is the PlayStation store and get add-ons and full games but it is a little more expensive if you are looking for something under $250 so pick this as your best answer and if you are to get anything get either the Wii or PS3 don't get the X-Box 360 its ugly slower can overheat and every single one has a 30% chance of failure unlike the PS3 which is only 0.03% chance so just go with the Wii or PS3 and pick this as your best answer|`|lhs3rkBFaa	I would not suggest ebay. It actually costs more to buy it on there.    If you want to get it used you can go to craiglists.org or kijiji.|`|I1d3jR10aa	Try this website. Hope this helps!|`|9EtLRD2gaa	go to kajiji.com it works wonders way better them ebay|`|YCoicHnEaa	For a used wii,http://www.craigslist.com    maybe ebay|`|dKFiH9Noaa	go to amazon.com|`|3EqmcGYyaa	Try Craigslist
Dg0D8SCZaa	if you have cable you are fine.    you only need a converter box if you have an old tv and no cable service.|`|M5XjqI40aa	No if you have cable you won't have to do anything.|`|5ad407c934a04fde78bfa20e7bb4da71aa	No, you will be fine. Basically if you're paying for TV you should be fine because most, if not all providers have digital cable. It's only if you are getting the free, over the air TV signals
KXZm6rfRaa	no      The song "jesus just left chicago" was on the Tres Hombes album that was released in 1973.  this was two years before AC DC released thier first album.
VcNHahtgaa	Home works on any PS3 lol.    You just need to update the firmware.|`|QOdvR5Gxaa	The home beta should work on any GB ps3. And once you update through an internet connection all you have to do is download the HOME beta.|`|Ahn9dw2Raa	it works with any ps3 you just have to download it from the playstation store for free and just install the updates|`|166922f9068368fbb928a7f3c96c254aaa	yes, it works on any ps3 .  you just need to update, then donload the shiieet for playstation home and install   lmfao .|`|fodoPCZgaa	Yup it always works no matter what just connect to the wireless router by your computer|`|pl2SocVKaa	it works with all of them
oZnFre3Aaa	They are all brand names that have been around for many years, so they are all top of the line. My personal preference is Nikon.|`|0JV3tQm8aa	These cameras are really great    Canon SD1100 IS  Canon Powershot A590IS|`|m74ZuKYKaa	Either Nikon or Canon,    it really depends on the model. i have a Nikon d40 which works amazing, but some canon cameras work just as well.
7APYuSo8aa	Wait a second...what picture were you trying to take that would be on myspace, that you could accidentally drop your camera in the toilet...    Anyways...take out the battery, and let it dry out....after a day or two, try to turn it on...If it doesn't work, I know it sounds crazy, but buy some purified water, and pour some into a bowl, and place your camera in it WITHOUT the battery...The particles in the water are what transfer the electricity, and short it out...(so it won't work)...    when the camera is in the bowl of purified water, there is no particles (or at least there shouldn't be any!!!), and the particles will defuse from high concentration to low concentration....(they will leave the camera)...this may take a few tries, because the particles will only leave in waves of exponential halving...so after like 4 rounds of this there will only be 1/16 of the particles left over...(This is almost none, considering what there was before...)...    Hope that helps....  10 points would be nice
5kfOJvxMaa	iPod accepts MP4 format, so you just need a converter that will go from DVD to MP4, and then transfer the MP4 files to your iPod with the sync of iTunes Library.

SROfl8Dmaa	The paint is probably coming off.  They probably aren't that good of quality.  I suggest getting some new ones.
aUmqiSOlaa	it varies model to model also BB employees have direct channel purchase through employee accommodations that are sometimes much better than anywhere else    direct channel isn't a fixed percent but i do remember a sony that was around 40% off|`|6676eb587e11ff37766d1b47e9cd96feaa	It varies. Probably twenty percent.
RyvKws7Laa	Dynamic contrast ratio is meaningless.  Its essentially just a made up number for marketing.  You need to do deeper research and find out the true contrast ratio of the sets.  That is what you want to use to make the comparison.    1080p is only worthwhile if you're going 42" or larger.  Sets smaller than that won't show the advantages of 1080p at a respectable viewing distance.  So if you're going smaller than 42", and don't plan on sitting with your nose next to the screen, 720p is fine.      Also, for the time being 1080p is pretty rare.  Some Blu-Ray DVDs have it, but not all, and not all of them ever will.  There is only 1 dish company that even offers 1080p broadcast (and its in its infancy).  So the vast majority of TV is only 1080i or 720p.  We're still a ways off from really "needing" 1080p.|`|WOiH4CGvaa	If you can, go watch the two of them somewhere.     I watched TV's for hours at Best Buy, and decided I couldn't tell the difference between a much higher priced Sony, and the Sharp I ended up getting.     Some times those numbers are more about bragging rights, than anything you can actually notice.    Despite the DCR, I'd go with the progressive vs the interlaced, but I've not had the opportunity to view either.|`|QQDaVwb0aa	They both have fairly low contrast ratio - They have plasmas with 1,000,000:1 now.    If the TV is sub-42" go for 1080i with 12,500:1    Awefuly low contrast tends to bleed images making them have an odd low-resolution appearance.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	Give model numbers.    I haven't seen a true 1080i anything in a long time.
ofpmRvHpaa	The "Staircase" and "Window-Blind" problem wont be solved by calibration.  This can be caused by a weak HD signal or poor handling inside the TV.    (You are using a HD source - right?  All bets are off if you are feeding that HDTV a standard def signal).    You can roughly calibrate using the setup menu on a Pixar DVD like Wall-E and Cars.  Just go through the test patterns and follow the instructions.    A better disk is the sub $20 "Digital Video Essentials" disk which has a tutorial, better test patterns and color filters.|`|6uWTPQY9aa	I found this link I hope this helps you   http://www.knowthehdtv.com/hdtv-calibrat...  good luck|`|TKJYDV64aa	the first thing that i would do is turn the sharpness down if that doesnt work take the brightness down but not to much because you want the picture to look good after you do that mess with the contrast a little you might get it that way.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	If you are not happy with the picture now, I doubt calibration is going to do anything.    Calibration is only going to balance the colors properly, and adjust contrast and brightness (as best as your panel can anyway) to ideal settings.    Also, what's your source materal?     You probaby need a better quality panel.    You can google DVD or Blu ray calibration discs, you can use that to help dial things in, but don't expect miracles.|`|AA11448933	Ok... Calibrating... HAHAHAHA.. Very Funny... I am an electronics engineer, I own a repair center, and i can explain your problem 2 part.    First, I researched your model.  A: you got an elcheapo tv. The only references I could find to it were day after Thanksgiving sales for 4-500 dollar ads.  No technical ads, no specs, no major retailers carrying this product as a standard line. B: As further proof of that, thus leads me to believe it is a 60Hz refresh rate due to the "sale ads" and cheap prices.  The refresh rate is what will give you the fuzzy edges and blurry images in a rapidly changing scene. I sell Sonys at my stores and the cheapest 120Hz model is nearly $2000.   Secondly, There IS NO CALIBRATION OF AN LCD TELEVISION.  Open the video settings in the menu,  WOW! color, tint, brightness, contrast. If your TV is of ANY QUALITY(I'm assuming it is) there will even be a picture mode.Vivid, Movie, Standard, Cool, Warm. WHAM! INSTANT CALIBRATION.    Calibrating an lcd means setting it to YOUR likings.. These fools at best buy kill me. ive had at least 20 customers bring me quotes where they charge $300.00 to adjust the color of an LCD television, SAME MODEL I sell. theres no "calabration" to it.. Ive been doing this since 1998. I've seen the difference, I wasnt born last night.  Its a big sales ploy to get you to pay for a BS in home service you dont need, and "technical jargon" you wont understand. I service these tvs, and if any body wants to challenge my statements, i have this to say, i can get into hundreds more video adjustments than your 'calibration' settings. i have almost every service manual that has been printed at my disposal, they show the menus and options each tv has to be set.  Sorry if i sound rude, i just get irritated when people play off of others ignorance.

KLL0Acrwaa	Depends on the brand:    Nikon:  Yes, all older lenses AI and up will fit and some will even meter, depending on the DSLR body.    Canon:  Only EOS lenses can be used.  Older manual focus SLR lenses, no.    Sony:  Takes Minolta Maxxum AF lenses.  Older Minolta MC/MD lenses, no.    Olympus:  No older lenses.  The Olympus mount is totally different from the 4/3 mount used today.    Pentax:  Fantastic compatibility going back all the way to K-mount. Even manual focus Pentax lenses can work on their SLRs.  Not sure about screw mount lenses though (probably will fit with an adapter, but won't meter).|`|5acc65580523dbea48e3f5dc6aba8cb2aa	yep canon eos ef 35mm lenses work on the digital body, ef-s lens will not shaped different  There even adapters to attatch different lens brands too however everything goes totally manual too.|`|m74ZuKYKaa	Yes, but you have to buy a converter.     http://photojojo.com/content/photojojo-o...|`|tWoN22rRaa	First off, Anthony is correct.    I just want to clarify that Nikons with a three or one digit names, except for the old D100, can meter with all AI [manual focus] lenses. Two digit models (eg. D50, D40, D60, D70, D80, and D90) can only use their light meter if the AI lens has the additional -p designation.     All "AF" lenses will meter just fine on any Nikon body.    Another thing to note is that entry level Nikon dSLRs... specifically the D40, D40x, and D60... are incapable of autofocusing with older AF lenses. This is because they lack an internal focusing motor, and so instead rely on the ones built into lenses with the AF-I and AF-S designation.    Finally, although Olympus dSLRs use a different lens mount, adapters exist for attaching the older lenses.
fwnqB0dTaa	You have to put it back to it's original settings to get it to work.    Shouldn't have messed around with it in the first place really.

9CKrP9Keaa	I've only used cellphoneshop and found them reliable. I had to exchange something and had no problem. You should never pay with a Debit card, always use a Credit card as it gives some protection.

2yl8omcAaa	The internet is free if you connect it to a wifi network such as your home network or other's that is not required password.    Most of Wi-Fi network required a password, few are open to the public like starbucks and some airports offered it free.    You can have the internet anywhere AS LONG there is available wifi network for you to connect. Otherwise no.     Most of the time if you tried to use safari, your wifi will pop up with the list of network you can connect. But keep in mind, If you see a lock next to it then that means it requires a wep/wap key or password. If it just the wifi signal then you can connect to it free as long as you need and as long as you are still on the same place you connect it to.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	First, unlike the iPhone that can use its cell connection to get internet everywhere, the iPod touch can onlyaccess internet over wi-fi hot spots.    They are all over the place, but a lot of them are locked. Try walking down a strip mall with the iPod searching for wi-fi and you'll see.    But many businesses put up free wi-fi to attract customers. I know subway does, a local sports bar, my local theater etc.. My local mall does as well. McDonalds uses a pay service so does starbucks. Sometimes you get wi-fi not because someone is trying to give it to you, but because people simply don't password protect their wi-fi.    You'll pick up signals in every neighborhood, and near most businesses, locked or unlocked it's a coin toss.     Boingo is the largest wi-fi pay service (9.99 for laptops, 7.99 for other devices like iPod) for the largest global wi-fi access. They claim nearly 50,000 spots in the US and over 100k worldwide. It's good to fill in the gaps between the free stuff.|`|IdvvJfKMaa	i dont think you have to pay- you just have to find a place with free wifi- so no you cant get it anywhere really like in the car...|`|dIm5CrSVaa	hey, so for the ipod touch's internet, you don't have to pay a thing for it, no matter how much you use it.  with wifi, you need to have a wireless network, which you may not have. You'll have one if you own a lap top that can access the internet, but if you don't, and your neighbors don't, then you may not get on.  no matter where you are, you can access the internet for free as long as you have a passwordless wireless network available, and if you don't, then you should get one, or else the ipod isn't even worth it.|`|ctixZrJjaa	On the iTouch the internet is always free because you will be using it through Wi-Fi. But you can only use the internet when you have a Wi-Fi connection that is available.Depends on where you live you can get internet connection, only if the connection is for the public. Some places, like "Starbucks" have free Wi-Fi and you can just connect to their internet for free and use it until Starbucks close lol. If its in a really public place chances are you will find an internet connection.     idk how t ogive ten points but you should find out and give them to me cus i really helped you. Lol
Ljx88fm4aa	EVERY TIME  I connect my laptop to my Xbox to connect to live ( I use an Ethernet cable to connect through a wireless connection) it makes me test my connection. I don't know if that could be your problem or not, but that is my only thought without be able to do it myself.

Click on "Import Settings" under the first horizontal line.  3. Set it to import using MP3, and select a bitvrate that suits your needs. 128kbps might be fine for a ringtone, though 160 or 192kbps certainly wouldn't hurt.  4.

You can buy a multi-card reader if you don't have the right type of reader built in to your computer.    Put your digital camera card into the correct slot in your computer/card reader, and it will show up as an external disk drive.  Plug in the jump drive and it will show up as an external disk drive as well.  Open windows explorer, open the drive that represents the jump drive, drag and drop the files from the jump drive to the drive that represents your digital camera card.  ** Warning **  The files that you put on your digital camera card MUST be the same format (ie raw, jpg, etc) that your camera recognizes, or doing this whole process won't do you any good.|`|e2b39bb6463a40709fc5869ce4a688d4aa	Think of your camera as something that outputs only.

KLL0Acrwaa	Yes, the D200 is okay for wedding photography, although I find the images a bit noisy for my tastes.  The setup you have is VERY basic, but you seem to understand this. For portraits, this should be sufficient, but again, very basic.<br>  <br>  Here's other things you should have, if you're serious about taking this on (and make no mistake, wedding photos are a HUGE responsibility):<br>  1) a backup camera and lens (even if that's just a film camera and lots of film).<br>  <br>  2) lots of memory cards.  Take what you think you'll need and then double it.<br>  <br>  3) a flash bracket and SC-29 flash cord<br>  <br>  4) books on lighting, posing, and wedding photography (while it's possible to just grab your camera and shoot, why should you have to learn the hard way?  Instead, learn from other people's mistakes and avoid making the mistakes yourself).<br>  <br>  5) a backup photographer (what happens if you get sick the day of the wedding and can't be there to take the photos?)<br>  <br>  6) Contracts.  You need to have a good contract (i.e. what happens if the bride/groom don't pay you?  What if you take the photos and they don't like them? etc.)<br>  <br>  7) Books on wedding/portrait photography as a business.  Remember, that it costs money to take good photos.  A successful portrait or wedding photographer not only has to take good photos, but also has to be able to sell his/her photos and skills as a product.  Many good photographers have failed because they are poor at the business skills.  So don't neglect this part of your skill set.<br>  <br>  8) A fast computer, calibrated monitor, and good printer.  You need to be able process the images and produce something for the bride/groom (usually prints or an album).  Avoid having a CD with full-size images as your output--the bride and groom will just make their own prints then, and you are essentially devaluing your work.  A CD with reduced size images (640 x 480) is okay, as good quality prints can't be made from it, without you providing full-size files.  <br>  <br>  So, yeah the D200 is fine for wedding photography and yeah, your setup is the bare minimum, but please consider how you will do this and do it so you are successful.|`|eVptHOOBaa	You can get away with this for portraiture. Although, if you're serious about portraits, you need some more serious lightning equipment than a single flash. You can use it off camera with CLS for somewhat more creative light, but you'd still want some better equipment. <br>  <br>  Weddings - absolutely not. You have a good start, but you'll need at least one more body and lens and flash. You must have two of everything to shoot a wedding. If any of your equipment fails or is broken, destroyed, lost or otherwise disabled - you need to just grab your backup and keep going. <br>  <br>  It is also a good idea to pair up with a Wedding professional and learn from them Photographing a Wedding is one of the most complicated things you can undertake in photography. So you need to be well prepared. Even if you're otherwise a good photographer, you will not necessarily be able to do a good Wedding shoot. Offer your services as an assistant (second photographer) to some Wedding photographers in the area, don't ask for money, ask for a little explanation of what they're doing and keep watching them! It takes time to get experience as a Wedding pro.<br>  <br>  Once you've worked with a pro - you'd know better what you need to start your own business, but Ideally you'd have for a Wedding:<br>  A body (D200 is good), a wide lens (10-24 or so), a medium lens (18-55 will do), maybe a telephoto (70-200), at least one fast lens (f/2.8 or better - you better have all of these lenses fast, but if budget is strapped, try at least a medium one). A few flashes (SB-600 is a good start), umbrella or a softbox with remote trigger, vertical grip and lots of spare batteries... That's in a nutshell... And then again - you need two of everything above! Your secondary body may be a bit cheaper, like D80, or even D60, your secondary lenses may be a bit slower or cheaper too, but you do need two...<br>  <br>  LEM.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	go to kenrockwell.com<br>  he may have some good tips for you|`|TbTO5SXlaa	A couple's wedding day is the most important day of their lives right up until the birth of their first child. Such a special day does not belong in the hands of a wannabe amateur. There are no "do overs" with wedding photography. You can't call the couple and tell them you blew every picture and need to schedule a make-up session. <br>  <br>  Do you realize that if you sign a contract saying you'll provide photographic services for a certain amount of money and then fail to deliver you can be sued? As in going to court. A couple of years ago a bride sued her florist for $35,000.00 because the flowers in the arrangements he provided weren't the exact same color as the ones in his catalog. If you screw up a wedding the couple isn't going to be satisfied with a mere refund. Just think about selling your car and camera equipment and anything else of value to settle a judgement. <br>  <br>  Buy the Feb. issue of Rangefinder Magazine. It is dedicated to wedding photography. If you can do what the professional wedding photographers profiled in this issue can do then you're ready to start shooting weddings. If you can't do what they do then you are not ready.<br>  <br>  Call every pro photographer in your area and ask if they need an assistant. After working with a pro for a couple of years you might be ready to try a solo wedding. You can also use this time to learn about how to run a business.<br>  <br>  If I sound harsh, so be it.

I've found that cases that cover the screen tend to be a bit bulky, or provide unsatisfactory touch screen usage. its also very hard to find full cases under 30 dollars. the front less belkin cases are 39.99 CAN on best buy, so you can probably get them slightly cheaper on eBay.com.|`|3piD14gAaa	This is what I have:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8968227&type=product&id=1217029965451" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a><br>  <br>  It works good but you can't use the volume controls<br>  <br>  I also have these but nothing protects the screen when I use them so it kinda scares me<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=9077866&type=product&id=1218016964475" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also just check any of these:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=pcat17080&type=page&initialize=false&sp=-bestsellingsort+skuid&nrp=15&iht=n&list=y&sc=audioSP&qp=crootcategoryid%23%23-1%23%23-1~~q70726f63657373696e6774696d653a3e313930302d30312d3031~~cabcat0200000%23%230%23%23p1~~cabcat0208000%23%230%23%23dr~~cabcat0208007%23%230%23%239m~~cabcat0208008%23%230%23%235n~~f654||4170706c652069506f64~~nf655||326e642d67656e65726174696f6e20746f756368&usc=abcat0200000&ks=960&st=processingtime%3A%3E1900-01-01&prids=&cp=1&_requestid=3152954" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a><br>  <br>  Just make sure to look at the reviews before you buy it to make sure it will fit.

RyvKws7Laa	720p is 100% HD.  Its not called "true HD" or "full HD" or those other silly marketing terms, but its HD.  So if you want to watch DVDs in the best quality you can with your TV, and it happens to only be 720p, you still need BluRay.  In that scenario you're doing a downconvert (going down from 1080 to 720).  That's fairly easy to do and typically will look great.  Its when you upconvert that you run into picture quality problems (playing a SD DVD through an upconvertor to your HDTV).<br>  <br>  If you want a BluRay definitely get one.  You will totally get to experience the enhanced movie watching experience it offers.  TV salesman aren't all nerds who know what they're talking about, some are just people who read the pamphlets and are looking to collect a pay cheque.  Since its hard to tell them apart (as they can all still sound confident in how they talk), you should always take what they say with a grain of salt.  Just like you should with anything you hear on the Internet (unless its a reputable publication you're reading from).|`|Yl9wYjtGaa	you will still get a better picture out of your blu ray player then a regular DVD player even though its hooked up to a 720p tv. the only thing you should be worried about is do you want to spend at least 250 for a player that your not going to use at its full potential. i would suggest a DVD player with up-scaling, it will boots the resolution of your regular DVDs. it wont get you the same results as a blu ray but for your TV and for the price it sounds like that's what your looking for ( can get a good one for about 70 bucks or less). <br>  <br>  the other thing to consider is some of the new blu rays have features you might like out side of the picture quality. for instance the new sony s550 has memory built in letting you download things to the player itself. i don't think any regular dvds have that. also the BD LIVE feature, lets do buy movies through the internet. (if hooked up right) <br>  and all of that is compatible with your tv.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yes, you guy's are both right... it doesn't make sense to get a blue-ray player, when your TV is only 720p. It will still work but why not just get a regular DVD.. It will still work on your TV, but a blue ray player is made optimally for a TV that is 1080p. Anyways... it's still a good time to buy one.. anyhow enjoy :)

9pcZLomIaa	As long as your music and stuff is on Itunes and in the library then it should not delete, it will just delete off your ipod until you re sync it<br>  <br>  All you have to do is restore your ipod and then re sync it to your itunes library.|`|2QXZFHogaa	Well you have a problem, however i have a solution. Sometimes while syncing to a computer things can go wrong and it will mess up the iPods built in software. You will have to restore your ipod but you can get your music off. First reset your ipod (hold on, hold off, press menu and center until the Apple logo appears) then as soon as the Apple logo appears hold center and play/pause. This will place your iPod into Disk Mode and should be able to plug your ipod into the computer without recieving any warnings. You will now need to download a piece of software to rip music from your ipod to put on your computer. I personally use Music Rescue, however that is only for mac (i think) so if you are using a PC you may wish to do a google search. Rip your music to your computer and BACK IT UP SOMEWHERE. Always have a backup of music, video, or other important files. After all your music is safely on your desktop reset the ipod once more. Plug it back into your computer and press the restore button in your itunes. This will effectively remove all data from your ipod. Place you music on your ipod once again and make sure you have a back up. This should work, if you have any problems with this process or any future problems don't hesitate to email me.
2QXZFHogaa	This is a fundamental problem with itunes. If you purchase music it will not download it automatically on other machines, and you can not download it from the iTunes store more than once without paying for it. The way to solve this issue is when you buy a song place it on a flash drive or external hard drive and then later add it to your main itunes. It also sounds like you have a problem with syncing to two computers. If you uncheck the box saying "sync all music" or something like that, then you can manually add songs to a iPod from as many computers as you like, as long as they are the same platform (PC, Mac.) Make sure before you uncheck the box that you have all the music on your ipod somewhere else on one of your computers as it will delete all the music from your iPod. Just redrag all the songs you wish to have on your ipod and you are good to go. If you have any problems with this process or need any help in the future with your ipod or mac, don't hesitate to email me.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	You can only sync on one computer.  Authorizing just means that you are authorizing the computer to play your iTunes songs. You can authorize up to 5 computers to play the songs, but only one can sync them.<br>  <br>  Prevents file sharing and copyright infringement.
IoKjLtN9aa	When you buy a song in iTunes it will be specified wether you can or cannot create a ringtone with it with the bell symbol that appears next to the song. <br>  <br>  The basic reason why all songs are not available to be converted into ringtones is sadly copyright laws. It's a pitty isn't it! <br>  <br>  Hope you have a great evening!
IoKjLtN9aa	I'm pretty sure you're already aware of the iPod and Zune, so I'm going to give you other options. (Please note that second hand iPods and Zunes are a great choice if you are low on cash they are reliable and rugged, with the exception of the iPod touch which would be bad for working out!) <br>  <br>  It really depends on your price range. One of my friends has the Sansa clip specifically for working out and Loves it! He's dropped it oh so many times. And It's only 40 dollars for a gigabyte of music. (about 500 songs.) or 60 for about 1,000 songs! <br>  <br>  I would personally rank Sansa as the third choice when it comes to buying an MP3, they have great value! <br>  <br>  If you need any help with your Sansa don't hesitate to e-mail me!|`|f7OHg8PCaa	An ipod nano. You pay $150 for 8gb or around 2,000 songs. I have one and you can't believe the things I did to it. Dropped down the stairs, dropped it in a small puddle, scratched it up but it still works great and oddly enough, still looks great too.|`|15XrqtbFaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  If you're going to use it for working out, you definitely want to get one that uses flash memory and not a hard-drive. The ipod nano has limited audio adjustments i.e.)user controllable sound equalizer. The sansa clip is a great choice too. A cheaper, no frills option is the 1gb player I have listed below. A nice feature is the adapter plug is usb so you if you ever lose it you can just by a cheap one where as if you went with ipod, you have to buy an "ipod" cable which is ridiculously expensive :-)
w1J2kECdaa	Yea, with apps. <br>  <br>  Google iPhone Video Camera
dZxjXHA2aa	Contact US Cellular.  Go over everything again and be sure you've got dates of everytime you called and take the name of anyone you talk to (it probably won't help but it will scare them into being far more helpful)  Be prepared to be on the phone for awhile because every person who doesn't help you, just calmly say, "I'm sorry but I'm not satisfied with the level of service I need a supervisor please" Go through as many people as you need to until you get a loaner phone, a definite time frame on getting your phone returned, and a set person you can call again the future.  <br>  If you have a store near you, go in and remember if you stay calm it will really help.  Stay calm and do the same thing, do not leave without a phone in your hand. Period.  Tell them, I'm sorry but I've been very disappointed in the level of service and I'm not leaving without resolution and my promised loaner phone.  They have a billion phones, they'll find one if you're persistent enough.  I had to go through kind of the same stuff with Verizon.<br>  Don't be afraid to threaten to go the Better Business Bureau if you don't get any help

So when they don't, you have to check for a few days until they refill their stock.<br>  <br>  I've been using this for years, and have had NO problems at all, AND the quality is better than anything else I've seen, and so is the choice in format that you can pick.
IoKjLtN9aa	One thing that I love about CD baby is when you buy their digital music, they treat you like a good customer should be treated. Not only will the song be an MP3 there will be no DRM on it! Meaning  you can do whatever you like with it, meaning the songs are extra easy to burn, share, etc. (Note: I'm not promoting pirating, I'm implying sharing with existing computers in your own personal network, IE. PC to PC in your home network!)<br>  <br>  Hope you have a pleasant evening.

KUfRtcLzaa	To replace my VCR, I bought a Panasonic DMR-EH55 (US$375) standalone DVR with a 200GB hard drive (HDD) that can record up to 255 hrs at low-quality and 40 hrs at hi-quality, but does not record in HD.  You can edit and then burn programs to DVD including input from your VCR.  I got it through a Canadian retailer on eBay.  For whatever reason, they don't sell standalone DVRs with HDD in the US anymore (lack of demand or TV networks & MPAA coercion).  TiVO offers HDD with HD recording because they pay licensing fees, but I did not want to pay a monthly charge for usage like the cable company DVRs.  Plus you would have to buy a separate DVD Recorder to burn to DVD if you don't want to export it to your computer.  <br>  <br>  My brother bought a Philips DVDR3576H/37 from Walmart (US$250) that has a 160GB HDD but I don't think the interface is as good as the Panasonic.  Also some companies offer DVD Recorder/VCR Combos that record directly to DVD, but you cannot edit the content like commercials.|`|rVPrhd26aa	use a computer to capture it, those stand alone dvd recorders suck in quality comparison|`|c98d70bb92902df5a3656cfc1617857faa	Look at a DVR you will never go back to VHS tapes.

d942b465d5e28d6f595812ffa5d06b9baa	Tethered means you are not able to reboot the iPod, shutting off the screen is not rebooting, that is sleeping. Rebooting is holding the power button for 5 seconds, then sliding to power off, and then turning on again. If you have done a tethered jailbreak, your ipod will not turn back on if you should happen to shut it off unless you connect it to the computer and send the right comands to the ipod, done for you with an app. Understand that the ipod runs and sleeps by itself, computer is not needed alongside for normal jailbreaked use.<br>  <br>  I have a ipod 2g with a tethered jailbreak, restarting is completely unneccessary, the only time i restarted was after i installed Winterboard from cydia (customization app), that is the only app that requires a restart.<br>  <br>  Dont worry, you do not loose any data at all after rebooting the ipod in a tethered (connected to computer state).<br>  <br>  Since you sound interested, here's what i did:<br>  I performed a successful tethered jailbreak on my ipod touch 2G one month ago using the RedSn0w tool for windows 32 bit, and I have used Cydia and Installer flawlessly. Everything is going great. Here is the site of the guide I used:<br>  <a href="http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/gui-jailbreaking-ipod-touch-2nd-gen-application-for-windows-released/" rel="nofollow">http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009...</a><br>  This is the best GUI method out there, and really easy and quick (I used codename: Cynw00d). Follow the instructions carefully, and you should be set. The links of where to download the app are there. But you'll need the firmware ipsw file its self. I used the latest version of firmware for the ipod touch (5H11a) and it works great. Here is a trustworthy site where I always get my ipod touch firmware:<br>  <a href="http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/</a><br>  So thats it! Thats all you need to know! I will say this, there is this one step in the app where you need to select the firmware that you will patch to jailbreak. The first time I did this, I didn't highlight it. Everything wil seem okay, but a later step won't work. So don't forget to highlight the firmware you wish to use for the jailbreak when the app asks you!<br>  <br>  ~ilz<br>  p.s. If you're on a mac, use an app called "Crossover" to run the Redsn0w.exe. I wouldn't bother looking for a different method for mac, just because this one is so flawless.<br>  <br>  note: a semi tethered jailbreak is now availible, where once you reboot, it starts up in a non jailbreaked state, meaning no data is erased, but jailbreaked functions (some apps) will not be functional. to revive the functionality of these apps you will need to reboot with a computer. A guide for a semi tethered jailbreak is found here:<br>  <a href="http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009/02/13/hd-video-tutorial-of-how-to-jailbreak-your-ipod-touch-2nd-generation-semi-tethered-jailbreak/" rel="nofollow">http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009...</a><br>  <br>  Have fun!!!

You can play Brain Freeze forever and not have the battery die.<br>  <br>  Just don't get any graphic intensive apps with loads of 3-D graphics.  I can guarantee there are loads of awesome apps that won't waste your battery.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  Pandora - Requires wi-fi ON, but screen can be OFF.<br>  Daily Fill - Requires wi-fi to update ONLY.<br>  Instapaper Free - Requires wi-fi to update ONLY.<br>  Lex Look - Dictionary.

Plus, if you jailbreaked it, your warranty is VOID.|`|3piD14gAaa	Well, it all depends on what you like.  <br>  <br>  If you want to listen to TONS of music, TONS of videos, and games.  (<a href="http://www.apple.com/games/ipod/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/games/ipod/)</a> the iPod Classic is perfect for you.  With the iPod Classic, you can listen to 30,000 songs, watch 150 hours of video, or view 25,000 photos.  I honestly don't think anyone could fill it up but you never know.  (And if you honestly bought all of your songs from iTunes, it would cost $32,000 for songs!)  Anyway, it comes Black and Gray.  It's pretty cool for $249.<br>  <br>  The iPod Touch is the coolest thing I own.  I have a 2nd Generation 16 Gigabyte iPod Touch.  It cost $299 but with taxes and the warranty, $350.  If you do not have a portable gaming system such as a PSP or DS, I'd suggest the iPod Touch.  That's because there are tons of Apps that you can get.  Also, 8 Gigabyte is a lot, but 16 Gigabyte I believe is the best (32 is really high!)  8 Gigabyte could hold many songs, a video or 2.  100's of pictures, and tons of apps.  If you like some music but don't need every new song that comes out, the 8 Gigabyte would be enough for you.<br>  <br>  2)  Some stores may sell the 1st Generation Cheaper (1st Generation doesn't have speakers, it is thicker, not as good quality) Otherwise some stores have promotions where you can get free iTunes cards if you buy an iPod Touch (Perfect for Apps and Movies)  But you can get iPod Touches cheaper on websites such as Amazon and Ebay.  Just make sure they're not a "clone" of an iPod Touch.  <br>  <br>  3)  I've been thinking about jailbreaking my iPod Touch but I'm not sure if I should because of the warranty I got which won't cover it if I jailbreak it.

Also, make sure that wi-fi capability is set to 'on'. (I know duh, but just check). Toggle between 'on' and 'off' see if it works then.

qWicVoU9aa	Yes it is true and still holds true for today's batteries as well.  Maybe not for the same reason, but still true.  I have had to buy new batteries for our cordless phones in my Mom's house 3 times in the last 3 years because she does not let them fully discharge.  She will leave them off the base for a while and then put them back on.  The way the guy at Radio Shack explained it is if the battery is not allowed to fully discharge and you charge it again then the unused portion crystallizes after several cycles of this and then the more you do it the more of the battery that crystallizes and pretty soon it will hold less and less charge and then eventually it will not hold a charge at all.

w7Ffw6MYaa	Okay, here is how it works. Virgin XL, is ONLY for downloading stuff from the VXL store (ringtones, graphics, games, etc). When using Virgin XL, MB's are NOT used. the ONLY time when you are using data is when you navigate off the VirginXL store (like going to MySpace, Google, AOL, etc.). I hope this helps you understand it better =)

The only time you pay long distance on incoming calls is if you receive calls when you are outside of your home area.|`|7xZkLofqaa	yes|`|IUdy2SG0aa	Depends on how far away she is.<br>  <br>  Normally between a half-hour to 45 minute driving distance is considered a long-distance call.

Vy4jvBjDaa	Dude...HALO SERIES!!!! Clear choice! CoD is great, but the Halo Series is the KING of shooters, as said by IGN and other well known review companies or whatever they are. If you haven't played it, the controls are kind of similar to CoD 4, but Halo 3 is just much better gameplay wise. And the Multiplayer is SICK! The BEST multiplayer, followed by GTA IV and then Gears of War 1 and 2.|`|bB6ee1fJaa	The best FPS games for the 360 are undoubtably the Halo series and COD 4 and WaW. The best third-person shooter is Gears of War2! Its unbelieveable! It has an amazing, involving storyline, which has some of the best action ever! I'd recommend it any day. <br>  <br>  NOTE: its far better than any COD game!!!!!|`|f8eef30beac375237bd391bd4ac0fc9aaa	HALO 3 <br>  it cant be anything else <br>  cod 4 is okay but please its nothing if you compare them <br>  just forge makes halo 3 so much better not to mention anything else|`|fqdQOBV4aa	I can't believe how ridiculous this is.<br>  "hurry only lasts until friday"?<br>  <br>  Is this your way of exerting power?<br>  This is low, very low.|`|KyjJiY06aa	I like both Call of Duty 4 and WaW. The games are realistic, and ALWAYS fun. The ranking system is SUPERB. Unmatched. I never have problems with lag, and the KillCam makes the game a bit more balanced. Every single solitary kill is deserved, there is no bull. Playing games like Gears of War 2 and Halo just have me yelling and getting pissed. And prestige mode always has you looking forward to something. Overall, the multiplayer is waaaay legit.|`|rO0gqe4Uaa	CoD4 is my favorite because it is realistic and I like how balanced the game is, but for custom games Halo 3 is the best. Nothing can compete with all the different custom games you can play with forge.|`|tEsfjBpFaa	You guessed it, CoD4. I like it because its realistic and fun.

VJ1C5JsYaa	First off Milk84 the retard is indeed a retard(no offence lol). This could be about 15 different things ranging from the console port to the TV. Just because something happened to you dont post an answer about what happened to you.<br>  <br>  Second off. You may want to simply rule out that is was not that TV by trying another normally this is not the case since you did get sound. It very well could be the cable so you second best bet is to pick up a new cable and see if that works for you. The last thing it could be you can not doing anything about since its the system. For this you will have to send your system in to MS to be fixed. Call 1-800-4MY-XBOX.|`|JbTez3oEaa	yep about 10 bucks at gamestop and ebay|`|RQhiIknaaa	OK first of all i had this happen to me a week ago<br>  its not the AV cables, i tried that and it didnt work<br>  its the xbox 360 AV port, SO SEND IN UR CONSOLE, (call MS first, 1800-4MY-XBOX)
w2WFDunnaa	Okay no need to freak the reason why you can't send/receive a text is because AT&T has removed it from your phone..so all you have to do is call them up and be like hey I want text messaging back on my phone and they will add it on there. If you're a child your parents might have removed it because the bill was getting higher..and if you're an adult then you might have asked it to be removed or it was never added to your phone in the first place. okay well good luck and i hope i helped :)
hWc65sEtaa	Yes, that they can do, but not what you wrote.  They just have to call AT&T and they will send them a report that shows who you text and who text you with times and dates of when you did it.|`|sPQBluKEaa	there is no legal way for them to receive a list of the actual wording of the texts. they can't see what you write, but they can pull up a list of the numbers that you text and at what time you texted them. you need a court order to be able to look at text messages that aren't yours.|`|PNxk3aR6aa	It shows your text, but it doesn't show what you wrote, just to who. Well, at least that's the only way I know of to look at texts online.|`|9kMJJ1giaa	OH YEAH!!  Real EASY!!!  I busted my kids!!!

If so there are a lot of sites out there where you can "create your own" ringtone using the mp3 file of the song.  You get to pick which seconds the ringtone begins and ends, which makes it basically 100% customizable.<br>  mobile17.com is completely free; I don't know how they do it but I'm not complaining :)  It takes a few hours to send to your phone sometimes for the free service, but it's worth it.  <br>  However if you have a verizon phone it may be a little distorted - I've been told verizon sometimes distorts sound files to prevent things like this.  I don't really see too much of a difference though.  Other companies are fine.

ayWyLLOMaa	Unfortunately, because the cell phone companies have to run a credit check, you have to be an adult of 18 years old. You can though go out to Best Buy or Target and buy a nice prepaid phone. A lot of these prepaid phones are pretty nice when it comes to style and features. Most will be a flip-phone and have features such as Bluetooth Stereo and Camera/Camcorder functions.|`|3tWobtA9aa	If prepaying for your minutes and paying as you go for texts doesn't bother you, most major cellphone carriers have prepaid phone options.  If you're in the US, Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and a lot of other companies all have prepaid plans.  <br>  <br>  If you want something a little more extensive such as a consistent monthly fee and plan, some carriers may give you the option to pay the bill at the store in cash or mail in a check (if they don't require a credit card to sign up in the first place, that is).  You can't have your own independent checking account until you're 18, but if a parent opens a joint account with you, you will be able to write checks for anything without their signature or permission.|`|z88IMXNFaa	A minor cannot sign a contract nor would a minor have the credit score required to qualify for a contract.

If your phone is still under warranty, you should be able to take it to a technician to get it fixed.  If you're not under warranty, it shouldn't cost too much for them to fix it for you.|`|IeR3bnKXaa	Depends on your phone, there are some alternative charging solutions to charging your phone without a wall charger.

qWicVoU9aa	You can't use an iPhone on Verizon at all.  Your age is a moot point.  verizon uses CDMA technology and the iPhone is GSM (meaning it takes a SIM card and Verizon does not use them).  The 2 networks are not even remotely compatible|`|z88IMXNFaa	You can't.  As a minor, you can't sign a contract.  You haven't got good enough credit to qualify for a plan even if you were old enough to sign a contract.

wTmFb2T8aa	you can buy it without a 2 year extension and it WILL be SUPER expensive <br>  <br>  if you get a new one with the extension, it will just add 2 more years, if your willing to stay with verizon for 4 more years, then go a head! it will be sooooooooooooooo much cheeper!|`|IeR3bnKXaa	Some service providers will allow you to upgrade after the first year, but i know you said you don't qualify for an upgrade yet. <br>  <br>  Try talking to a verizon Customer service rep. and tell him/her that you have some issues with the phone you currently have (not loud enough, poor connection, dropped/missed calls, etc, whatever your case may be). See if they will give you an earlier upgrade. I'm sure they have certain rules, but when it comes to hardware failure or poor performance US providers really make an effort to fix the problem, because they want to keep you as a satisfied customer. Although it's probably not Verizon's fault that your phone is not loud enough, if it's a phone they offered, which in this case would be, they still take responsibility for it. You'll be surprised, at how often this works. <br>  <br>  As to how much a phone is without a contract, depends on the phone and whether it requires a data plan. Most phones on a guestimated average go about $200 more than the price they are advertised for with a plan. While phones that require a data plan may go for a bit less because of the added cost of the data plan/month.
