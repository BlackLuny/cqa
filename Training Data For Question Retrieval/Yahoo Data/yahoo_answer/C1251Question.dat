20090222154756AA6z7Zl	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Need help with finding integral of 3x^3/sqrt(1-x^2) dx?	There you go. lol    Here's what I have done so far, and I'm stuck/confused. Also, it does not seem to lead me toward the right answer. Maybe I'm wrong about that. But I have:   x^2=sin^2θ   x=sinθ   dx=cosθdθ      Right so far?      Then I replaced x^2 with sin^2θ, so that √(1-sin^2θ)= √(cos^2θ)       Then I replaced the dx with cosθdθ, giving me ∫ 3x^3 cosθdθ / √(cos^2θ)    I thought that the square root and the ^2 made the bottom just cosθ, and i thought the cosθ on the top cancelled with the cosθ on the bottom. Then I replaced the x^3 with sin^3θ so I had ∫ sin^3θdθ. I'm having trouble from there. But am I right so far?   Do split it up into ∫ sin^2θdθ * ∫ sinθdθ? what's the most efficient thing to do?   The answer is -((x)^2+2) √(1-x^2) + C      All help is appreciated. God Bless! later!

I am interested in a very efficient method of turning a very high torque power source (a 12 r.p.m. floating waterwheel) into something that will turn a generator 1200 r.p.m.  (a 1-100 ratio)  Each waterwheel might produce 2/3 - 1 h.p. of turning force.      I think a good idea might involve using radial piston pumps like the ones shown here, as the pump on each waterwheel:   http://www.boschrexroth.com/business_uni...       and then pump a continuous loop of hydraulic fluid between the waterwheel, and a generator mounted safely onshore.  I'd probably use vegetable oil as hydraulic fluid, to be most environmentally responsible.      And I wonder if a motor like this would work to turn the generator:    http://www.boschrexroth.com/business_uni...       I see these devices come in different sizes.  What size do I need for this 1 h.p. application, and how do I attain the relationship of 1 turn of the waterwheel equaling 100 turns of the generator?        I've tried to ask my hydraulic shop these questions, but they only seem to repair equipment, and they don't seem to know these answers.  I'd like to know a little bit more before I try another hydraulic shop for advice, so I don't look so dumb.  If you could help me out in my pursuit of knowledge here, I think this idea could be very useful in many locations as a new energy source.  I'm willing to give this idea to the public domain, I don't think it could be patented anyway, and I hereby disclose this to be public domain information from here on out, anyway!        In addition to the size and ratio information needed, If this is a good idea, also please tell me, and if this idea is tragically flawed somehow, please tell me that also.  I'm currently using a 1-100 gear increaser, and they use 4 internal gears and produce a LOT of friction losses.  I'm hoping to gain higher efficiency, and eliminate the necessity of trailing wires to the waterwheel itself, plus I think a loop of vegetable oil would be a safer environmental risk.  Thank you, engineers and knowledgeable designers!
20090222142843AA4VG0o	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Please answer....i reallly need it thanxxx?	Plzzzzzzzz help really hard!!!!!!!?   Biology calculation help is needed!!!!1?   ok this is the question: and it about the standard deviation calculation..      "in a population of men the systolic blood pressure shows a normal distribution.the mean of the population is is 125(measured in mm Hg) and the standard deviation is 10. if the population was 1000, how many of them have a blood pressure between 115 and 135mm Hg?"      According to the book the answer is 680 but i have no idea of how they got this!!! i have been trying to work it out for 5 hours but i can't do (even my biology teacher can't do it ) so can you please help me solve this please do it steps and explain your answers!      (115-125)/10 = '-1' column in the tables   (135-125)/10='1' column in the table   HOW DO YOU WORK OUT THIS BIT i don;t the  0.840 and o.160    " you will find that the probabilities underneath the '1' table as 0.840   if you gave the rest of the table with negative numbers, under -1 is 0.160"   thank you

So, i guess what im asking is, how can i chose (or how can i find a way to chose) what career path i want to take, because i know i cant take both, but i keep getting caught between both and its effecting my studies (espcially in my AP biology class which i only got a B- in last quarter because i got back into investing and so lost some interest in reading my textbook).       Also if anyone is a doctor, please tell me the pros and cons of being a doctor personally.  I'm loooking into Anesthesiology, radiology, maybe surgery...   and for investing im looking to be a stock broker       NOTE:  Both are not for the money but rather because they both deal with "helping" people in one way or another (plus some other reasons i like both fields).      Im in high school...      How do i choose!!!?????

My parents will be so upset, and they know that I'm not doing well, but they want me to bring it up. It's too late though because the trimester ends in 2 weeks! I talked to my counselor, my Math teacher is her husband.. (wierd how that worked out huh?) And I'm in High School, so if i fail this class, that means I will not get my credit. The bright side is that I can fail four classess & still graduate with my class on time.      i will probably retake this class next trimester if it is available. But, what If I dont do better? There's no way I can do worst, but what If I don't improve. Another problem is that, I tried so hard to bring up my Math grade, it brought all of my other grades down! Now, I dont know what to do!      I'm so lost in my world...Help anyone?

Any other info regarding this and explanations are well appreciated. I do not have any very difficult equations in mind. Can′t this be done with second degree polynomials and differentiation?

How many of these hospitals do have enough radiologists? Round to the nearest whole number.      and the 2nd is:   The average cost of 30 seconds of advertising during the super bowl 6 years ago was $2.3 million. If the increase in cost over the last 6 years has been 17%, find the average cost of 30 seconds of advertising during the super bowl this year. Round to the nearest tenth of a million.      This last problem I figured out but I wanted to check my answer.    The question is:   Telecommunications equipment maker Nortel Networks says it will lay off 4000 workers globally.

The third student will change all the locker doors that are multiples of three. (Change means closing locker doors that are open, and opening locker doors that are closed).

20090222140518AAniQ6o	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Question about probability?	Perform an experiment and choose a probability close to the relative frequency you found. - If a coin tossing led to 1224 heads in 2500, the relative frequency is then F/N = 1224/2500 = 48.96%. You could choose the probability of heads for the coin to be 49%. Others might choose 50%. A probability estimated from a relative frequency may be different for different people. But it is more likely to be close to what would happen in the long run than a guess would be. Also, the more times an experiment is repeated, the closer the relative frequency should be to the probability.         Could anyone explain to me what that means but in a much,much, much simpler way? Thanks!!. Use small words please, not big words. Thanks again.

20090222170459AAVx9p3	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Does "static weight bearing" mean something different from how much weight something can hold?	I am reading a catalogue of childrens toys and it has some different types of swings in it.  Some of the swings are made for indoor play and the description says it is "static weight bearing up to 440 lbs".  What exactly does this mean.  I'm pretty sure it doesn't mean it can hold a 440 lb child, right?  I would assume it is talking about the force from the swinging and the weight of the child combined.  Is that right?  So how much can the child weigh if that is the case? Please explain.  Thanks!

20090222182841AA2jOZ0	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Has anyone else seen this type of UFO?	On July 4th 2007 I was at a family BarB-Q It was night time we was in my aunts backyard shooting off fireworks me and about 30 family members. Some1 says whats that and everyone looked up at the sky and floating about 500 feet above my aunt house was this Glowing ball It was probably the size of a Basketball but since it was so high up it seem smaller. inside the ball was a flame like it was a candle inside it. everyone was getting scared and nervous. we thought it was a firework at first but firecracker burn out and they move fast. This ball was moving in a perfect Horizontal motion at about 15mph. No joke we was getting worried somebody said maybe it a Terrorist weapon Seriously we thought it was gonna drop somewhere and wipe the whole city out. My aunt got it on camera i haven't seen that tape yet but we all just prayed that nothing would happen. and that we all made it home safe that night. because was scary im not gonna lie and im a 20 year old man that isn't scared of much. But when i saw that thing i was ask forgiveness of my sins NO LIE i never speak about that because no1 would believe me But today i was watching UFO hunters on tv and i saw a object that look just like that of what we saw that night

HOBr (aq)   H+ (aq) + OBr (aq)      Ka = 2.3 x 10-9         Hypobromous acid, HOBr, is a weak acid that dissociates in water, as represented by the equation above.      (a) Calculate the value of [H+] in an HOBr solution that has a pH of 4.95.      (b) Write the equilibrium constant expression for the ionization of HOBr in water, then calculate the concentration of HOBr (aq) in an HOBr solution that has [H+] equal to 1.8 x 10-5 M.      (c) A solution of Ba(OH)2 is titrated into a solution of HOBr.      (i) Calculate the volume of 0.115 M Ba(OH)2 (aq) needed to reach the equivalence point when titrated into a 65.0 mL sample of 0.146 M HOBr (aq).      (ii) Indicate whether the pH at the equivalence point is less than 7, equal to 7, or greater than 7. Explain.      (d) Calculate the number of moles of NaOBr (s) that would have to be added to 125 mL of 0.160 M HOBr to produce a buffer solution with [H+] = 5.00 x 10-9 M. Assume that volume change is negligible.         I already know the answer to part (ii). It's 7, since the acid and base reach and equivalence once titrated. But I'm confused about the calculations.

20090222181950AAupVHe	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics - Projectile Motion?	A cannon is aimed across a gorge at an angle of 22.6 degrees above the horizontal. The mouth of the cannon is 1.00 m above the ground. It shoots a ball whose velocity upon leaving the cannon is 130 m/s.   a) What is the velocity of the ball after 2.00 s?   b) If the ball strikes the other side of the gorge 54.0 below the rim (55.0 m below the mouth of the cannon, how wide is the gorge?   -----------------------   Using trigonometry, I found the horizontal initial velocity is 120 m/s and the vertical initial velocity is 50 m/s. However, I am completely lost at approaching questions a) and b).   Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
