Well, then it continued on to his experience of seeing a toilet that is but a hole with the little tap to do the job. (i don't find much wrong with it, it's just a method, anyway)      Then, finally he said that - he saw people deficating on the railroad tracks along the city??      I know that he is nice person and did comment about people in Delhi being very courtious to him & were nice.      It wasn't too much of an embrassment for me (the only indian), but it's eating me to think,       Why CAN"T Indians take care of this business properly???

20090304232445AAnwvqI	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Why do people from the Scranton area take it so personal when people who outsiders think they sound southern?	People just wouldn't just randomly make this up. I've asked this question before and I've gotten some responses that'd sound like they should make sense, but still don't. The last time I asked this someone told me that late-nineteenth century Eastern and Southern European immigrants (Polish, German, Italian) were the ones who primarily settled this region. That's true. But there are other places, like in New Jersey, or New England, where the same exact groups have went, but there accents sound nothing alike today.Most groups (excluding Irish) who settled this region a while ago were non-English speakers, so perhaps they took influence from those who were. I've read that the Scots-Irish were the first predominate European settlers in Central Pennsylvania, which were the same in Appalachia and much of the south. I've read that Northeast Pennsylvania has similarities to Central Pennsylvania, so that could indirectly show you some relation.      When I say it sounds southern, that's not supposed to be negative, as people twist it into. It's just an observation. Is it because they don't like the south? Or they think people are trying to demean them? I'm not a lingual expert, but I know when my ears hear resemblences. Maybe it resembles more of the Mid-West? It's hard to find videos on Youtube or Google that talk about the NE Pennslyvania accent, so I found three random nights of news in Fox 56 to give examples of the accent.       http://www.myfoxnepa.com/myfox/pages/New...        http://www.myfoxnepa.com/myfox/pages/New...        http://www.myfoxnepa.com/myfox/pages/New...

Sometimes on those odd occasions, as you are buying things and receiving change, you notice out of nowhere, a coin from NZ such as a 10 cent.

So technically, can they be used here in Australia? And how do they end up in our system?

I'm applying to colleges in Ireland but I know even if I was to move there I would look like a fool trying to put on an Irish accent and act Irish. I've grown up mostly in Los Angeles which I hate. If I had at least grown up in New York I could take pride in that but Los Angeles...... I want to be Irish, not American. I constantly feel bad about not being Irish. Any advice?

I know that I've dealt with a lot of racism throughout my whole life, it was really insulting to me at first but then recently (I'm 18 now) I started to understand why it occurs in the first place (for example they're threatened, insecure, ignorant, attentive seeking etc.) and that they're just boys (hardly any girls bothered me about it)      But if i joined the army with a dominant of male soldiers who are all grown up I'm just wondering if it should be less than say high school or not?      I'm guess that since everyone's older that they wouldn't...   What do you think? Anyone in the army know if there is a lot or not?   Because I'm definitely not dealing with another couple years of racial hatred like in high school...      thanks...
