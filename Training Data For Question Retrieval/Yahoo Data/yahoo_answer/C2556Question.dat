20090220033910AAUBLmx	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Honda	How can i fix a problem with the immobiliser on a honda cr v?	I have a 1998 honda cr v automatic. I have one black key and the red mechanics key. When i try and start the car with the black key it will sometimes start and sometimes it wont. Occasionally it will start then the engine will stall while im driving. Im pretty sure its the immobiliser cos the green immobiliser light is flashing on the dashboard. Would having another key cut and re programmed fix this or does anyone know what else I can do? I have been told i cannot remove the immobiliser completely as its a honda factory job. I have disconnected the car battery overnight and re connected it but this didnt make a difference.

20090220041952AAnzvNo	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Female Driving Instructors.?	I have just begun driving lessons and when trying to find an instructor I thought it would be a good idea to find a female instructor for fear (perhaps the wrong choice of words but wanted to avoid the possibility) of male ones hitting on me.      Now that I have a female one, I'm not so sure. I feel as though she is looking at me all the time. Fair enough, as I'm sure she has too, to an extent check that I'm doing things correctly or I suppose in my case, wrongly. But I get this niggling feeling that she also might be hitting on me or at least like to. Whenever there's any eye contact, there seems to be that 'I fancy you look'.       It's hard to explain, but I generally get these kind of looks from male admirers. I'm hoping I'm not paranoid, but as it could be with males is there the possibility that a female instructor might find me 'hot' too?... Not that I think I am.   If I changed instructors, would I have to start from the beginning again which I don't want to do, as it would mean money down the drain and I can't afford it?      I have nothing against peoples sexual preference so long as it stays their business and not try to involve me.      I feel a fool for asking in the 1st place, as I'm not 100% sure I'm picking up the right signals and it might just be that I'm nervous with my driving anyway, but any advice would be appreciated.

20090203122918AAF64pw	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Transmission will not shift into Overdrive!!?	1991 Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight Royal, 4 speed Automatic. I can shift it through all gears manually but it doesn't want to shift into Overdrive automatically. I changed the Fluid & Filter and added some Lucas to the Fluid. Installed new Vacuum Modulator and hose but it still has the same problem.  I have a computerized tachometer in it and will see around a 1500 to 2000 decrease in the RPM's, on the Expressway,  around where it should be shifting into OD but I can't feel it or hear it shift. I can't hear it shift because it also has a strange low pitched noise coming from the engine compartment while driving. I thought it could be a vacuum leak or something else causing this noise & shifting problem. While looking for the noise I did find that the Serpentine Belt Tensioner Pulley is barely rotating, almost frooze up. Could this bad pulley be causing this shifting problem too by throwing the sensors out of wack? If not, does anyone have any ideas what is causing this? It's driving me nuts trying to figure it out!!  THANKS!!

20090220051951AAiuZGx	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Honda	2000 honda accord alarm does not arm when lockign the car (no horn no lights)?	Hey   I have 2000 Accord EX 4dr, 4cyl   I am having the same problem: When I lock the car, the doors lock, but no horn or flashing lights, and no blinking security light on the driver's door. I had this problem once before, and read somewhere that several 'lock-unlock's using the door lock button on the drivers door fixes the problem. Last time- it worked. However when I try it now, after several pushes all the doors except driver's door lock button get stuck, and still no alarm armed.   Tried the fuses, checked all the doors, trunk and hood - everything closes properly. I don't know what triggers the problem, but it could have something to do that both times a key (not remote) was used to unlock the door.   Does anyone know a solution to this problem, without going to the dealer?   Thanks in advance

Are there any ways I can prevent the title from getting mailed to my current address. I registered the title to my name on Wednesday Feb. 18, 2009, so it's been very recently and I doubt the title has been processed yet.      Do I have to show the DMV any proof of my address change, if so, how do I go about doing that.       I've read that I can go to AAA instead of the DMV (I am an AAA member). I'd sure like to go there rather than facing the ridiculously longs line at the DMV, and because it seems like it's closed every other day!

I just feel that 222hp is not fast enough for the way it looks.       I know its possible to put a turbo on a N/A 300zx.

Or would it be easier and less expensive for someone to get the the N/A  turbo ready and install one big single turbo? And also,  i dont know much about superchargers, but is it possible to use a super charger on a N/A? I just wanted to know what was the easiest and the cheapest way.       Granted I know its going to cost me some dough, but i wanted to know what was the smartest and most efficient thing to do. Where to purchase certain parts? Opinions?

20090220074943AA81Wrs	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	More problems with my 2003 Ford Focus...?	OK about a month or so ago...my car started shutting off while driving (no sputtering or stahling..just clean shutting off) and then before the car started to slow within seconds, the car dash lights would pop off and the gauges would go back to normal and it would accelerate and drive normally??? The only funny thing that would happen is that my CD player turns off everytime and resets itself so I had to reprogram station everytime..now this happened at least once a day in no sequence. Ok Auto Zone checked the battery and it is almost brand new, I just got it in Nov. bit there was some corrosion on the wire so we cleaned and it ran great for about 5-7 days.....now here we go again...this time the engine light came on and I took it to Auto Zone and the code read the Transmission Electrical Rellay...I called the Ford dealer and found one and it cost me a $100.00 for this little small fuse that plugged into side of the transmission. Now we changed that on Sun..immediately after changing this part (which required no unplugging of anything else or removing anything else) now the gear shift has a lot of resistance in it just to pull back to Drive??? I mean the car works and all but I know this is not common and why because of changing that one part did this happen...and of course it is Fri and the last 2 days whiling cranking the car in the morning...my cd player restarts itself...so I know the car will start cutting off again while driving....what is wrong? It seem really dangerous to drive and I have a toddler.....why are things happening back to back and why does it keep doing the same thing? It only has 63,000 miles and I bought used and have had for 4 years with no problem and it was a very clean, nice, well kept car when I purchased it...

20090220060356AAp64Vx	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Any mechanics or car knowledgeable people want to help?	The oil in my 2000 Grand Am was VERY low. My friend put 5 quarts of oil in for me, and said that it was just a little high, but I should be fine. The first time I drove my car, my car seemed to emmit smoke from the exhaust pipe when I stepped on the gas a little harder to go up a hill. My friend said that it's probably just the oil that he spilled onto the engine burning off through the exhaust. It happened twice. Both times I was going uphill and stepped on the gas pretty hard.   Is it just the oil? Or is something more wrong with the car.    I can't exactly recall the color of smoke, but I looked some stuff up and the one site I found mentioned that either way, my car blew a gasket, and I just wanted another opinion.   This is the site I previously used:  http://www.myhonestmechanic.com/articles...

20090220062041AAN12j7	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Toyota	01 Toyota Corolla with a fan-hitting sound when idle?	I recently purchased my first car-- a 2001 4-door Toyota Corolla. It runs great, but has a few quirks, and I would really like to know if they are anything serious or will become more costly to fix if I ignore them for the time being.       When my car is at a stoplight, especially when the car is pointed uphill, there is a sound like a fan hitting something. Sometimes it is very quiet and sometimes so loud that I'm anxious something's got to give. It does not seem to happen as often or as loudly if I am stopped on a flat surface or headed downhill. It does not seem to be coming from the far front or back ends of the car, if that's at all helpful. Any ideas what this could be?      The "Brake" alert light stays on from when I turn the engine on until it's warmed up. I have been driving it in 0-50 degree weather so far, so perhaps this is just a quirk of fluids and temperature? It seems to brake fine and the pads look to be whole and in one piece to my uneducated eye.      Thanks for any advice you can give me!

I told him that these cars are front-wheel drive. But he says its rear-wheel drive. He asks, how could the front wheels move as well as steer. So I decided to post it here. Am I wrong? Are those cars rear-wheel drive?
20090220064624AAhP6Mj	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Has anyone ever taken their road test in the rain?	I have my road test next week, and the day I am supposed to take it, it's supposed to rain. I am nervous as it is, and add rain to the scenario is worse. Should i really be worried about the rain? will it really effect it, even when i haven't really driven in the rain before? (they don't take us on the road...just the course, so i will only be driving at the max 15mph).

Why some of the roads in Bangalore are called as 100ft. road, 80 ft.road etc? I don't think its the width of the road. If you convert 100 ft. into meters its 30 meters and the roads actually doesn't have that much width (?)

Recently I have noticed that the first couple of times I put the brakes on after starting the car I hear this rubbing noise. It usually does not do this any more than a couple of times of putting the brakes on and does not make the noise again unless the car has been sitting at least overnight. What would cause this noise ?
