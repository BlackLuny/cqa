aSjdL4heaa	I assume you are talking about playing the VHS into a capture device hooked to your computer.  It all depends on the resolution provided by the particular capture device ... however there is an upper limit to the effective resolution.      VHS is analog (and not an especially good analog) conforming to the NTSC standard.  That means it has max 486 vertical resolution.  No matter what capture device you are using you won't get an effective resolution much better than about 640x480.|`|fN2xiQL7aa	The video coming from the VHS tape will be same quality going into a digital copy because of the condition of the video on the tape itself.

tjg7hLbMaa	This code is completely dependent on your IMEI (serial number) of the phone. It's not something that people can automatically supply online.<br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to look for an unlock company online or contact AT&T to see if they provide unlocking services. Alternatively, you may want to check at an AT&T store/kiosk (some of the workers do it on the side to make some extra cash or know people who unlock phones) and it may be cheaper than going through the company.<br>  <br>  FYI, the company I work for used to charge $250 to unlock a phone (which is comparable to the discount people receive for purchasing a phone with an agreement) but people have told me they've been able to get it done for less than $50 through a store rep.|`|93ae1ac3e146fa0a77be369ecc67b09caa	It's different for each Serial Number.

Xxviy63Paa	I hope you like versatility over user-friendliness because that's where the best results are to be had.<br>  <br>  There is a free video player called Mplayer, it has a windows version called Mencoder that can change anything to practically anything and resize it too. It works best from command-line, but there is at least one freeware GUI that works with it also.<br>  <br>  Another one I use is ffmpeg. Like mplayer it can do practically anything, and mplayer often invokes it (mplayer started on linux and most linux machines have ffmpeg by default). I am sure ffmpeg is available for windows and mac too. Yes you have to use command-line syntax but it's not complicated. Similar to this:<br>  <br>  ffmpeg -oac lavc -ovc lavc -w 368 -h 208 -i oldvideo.mp4 -o newvideo.mp4<br>  <br>  Not difficult at all, just read the directions.<br>  <br>  I am sure there are plenty of GUI freeware resizers also but nowhere near as versatile... if you want to make the video still look good after it's shrunk. Also most GUI freeware contains at least some level of badware. Like TVersity which demands you use .net to let it spy on what videos you watch.|`|aViAFuCEaa	<a href="http://vidpoint.webs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://vidpoint.webs.com/</a><br>  <br>  Free movies download for your Ipod and PSP and other MP4 players.

tjg7hLbMaa	I wouldn't risk it. It's best to keep it away from moisture. While a bit of moisture may not cause an issue with the working mechanics of your phone, the steam could cause problems with the moisture meter (it's a sticker generally found near the battery and sometimes they're placed throughout the phone inside where you can't see them). <br>  <br>  The moisture meter is what technicians use to determine if your phone has been exposed to water. The sticker turns pink when it has been exposed to water. A phone that is water damaged is automatically not covered under warranty for any issues that happen.|`|HBFHZXybaa	I  have a voyager also! I bring my phone into the bathroom, but put it far away, far away from any water whatsoever (try to).

XcF4L6KMaa	They are working on a CDMA version of the 8900 right now. It will be the 8930, and will come to verizon later this year. There is also a CDMA version of the bold to be released about the same time. Since ATT&T and Tmobile are GSM networks, you couldnt even get an unlocked model to work. And hopefully it will be a 3g phone when they do, because currently the fastest connection you can get with the GSM version is EDGE.|`|usOBadSraa	No, its only for t-mobile and maybe at&t...you can switch over to t-mobile if u want to get the curve 8900|`|oHAWdiTLaa	For now, It's just out for T-Mobile.

2KjMxlmJaa	First off, there is no polarity with AC.  So you are OK there.<br>  The power supply is a touch over voltage, but should be within the tolerance limits.  You should be good to go.|`|UtHnh0aHaa	Buy or borrow a meter to test the output of the power supply. It is best if you borrow one to have the owner test it for you.<br>  <br>  If it is regulated direct current DC at 16.5 vdc - it will not work. If it is however 16.5 volts alternating current, as your unit requires, you may have to add a small value limiting resistor in series to create the voltage drop. 0.5v at 500 mA = 1 ohm at a value of one watt for heat dissipation. <br>  <br>  Be sure to measure the output of the power supply to determine if it is AC or DC. AC voltage peak unloaded should be no more than 5 percent above the rating of the consuming device or you will fry the unit.<br>  <br>  Standard door bell transformers are rated at 16 volts AC.

It is illegal to download music with out paying royalties to the artist. They own the rights to their property. If they choose to sell music on line. They use legitimate websites. People are caught and prosecuted for each song downloaded. The fines are so huge that they cost more per song than the cost of purchase. People settle out of court in most cases rather than pay for lawyers and big fines besides the cost per song. Every computer leaves a digital signature on every web site, link, clicked on. That is traced by any one that wants to look. It is the same as your name, address, and phone number. The music industry has a 100 % conviction rate. Due to the amount of money involved A research agency working for all musicians and music industry 24 7  will find you. I had a friend that had to sell his house to pay of the settlement..

The best, and cheapest way to get music downloads is through MP3Lingo.  They offer unlimited music downloads for only a few bucks a month.

They also have just about every song in every genre.|`|PlZvDzZ2aa	I use limewire.<br>  Limewire and Frostwire are good, but you need to be careful with trojans or other malwear that may come with the song, as you don't know who you are downloading from.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you have virus protection before using a programme like limewire.|`|HZ7PjjuUaa	I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.hobbylazy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hobbylazy.com</a> .

xG5ZlJDqaa	Compact cameras are limited to what they can do with their lens. They only focus at certain distances away, go up to a certain focal length, etc. Slrs, on the other hand, has a interchangeable lenses system. You can buy specialized lenses for just about any task. If you're not limited by money, get a dslr. The Nikon D40 is the best value-for-money beginner dslr camera around, you should be able to get it easily for under $500 with kit lens. Then you may want to consider a "macro" lens if the kit lens doesnt focus as closey you would like. The cheapest is the Nikkor 60mm Micro, around $600 USD.<br>  <br>  If you're not ready to spend loads on a dslr, there are other options as well. Most recent Panasonic and canon cameras have macro capabilities that allows you to focus as closely as 1 centimeter away from the subject. Visit their website to see which suits your needs and budget best. If you want a even cheaper alternative, get a magnifying glass and hold it in front of the camera lens while taking a picture.|`|HFuI8oVYaa	Often, it's the lighting, not the camera.|`|qnukgFYzaa	get a better shot

1HtTxOOQaa	I liked the demo very much. I also have played the game (got the game from a fellow reviewer) and I must say that the demo doesn't justify the game. The game is so much better. The demo as you might know is the start of the game and the game actually picks up pace after the start so people have been stating that KZ2 doesn't live up ... or whatever without actually playing the game. The battle sequence are really satisfying and the graphics (which are awesome as well) always make you feel that you are in a battlefield or Warzone. I loved the game more than COD4 or Gears1/2.. which is a compliment in itself.<br>  <br>  Also, I don't know why people are saying that the controls are not COD4 like. I mean play COD4/5 if you want to play with COD like controls. KZ2 feels like Gears in FPS mode and brings in realism by adding the 'weight factor'.  Hence the movement are slower. Even I was finding it hard at first (since I was playing COD5), but I quickly got used to it and the 'cover' technique which is a great feature.<br>  <br>  Ratings: <br>  Demo:8/10<br>  Game:9.5/10 (0.5 cut for no co-op other than that, it's the best FPS I have played on a console)|`|xwEPYEqSaa	9.7/10<br>  I really liked it execpt aiming while zoomed was kinda hard for me but in the real game there will be a sensitivity adjuster.|`|YjIZb7RYaa	First, the good news: A Killzone 2 demo is available in North America and Europe, offering a glimpse of the anticipated shooter's first two stages.<br>  <br>  The bad news?

The demo will be publicly available in the North American marketplace on February 26, one day before the game hits stores. <br>  <br>  The glimmer of hope? The European PlayStation Store is offering the entire demo to the public,  And North Americans can easily make a new PlayStation Network account, one with a European address, to gain access.|`|YT1vOwq6aa	straight up 20<br>  its that good.<br>  I LUB IT!!!<br>  its DA BEST!!!|`|pOi0wewIaa	A lot of people <br>  <br>  It's not coming out on the PSN Store.<br>  <br>  eh 5, it's just a game.
VkAMAtEiaa	1. Keep it in a Open space (not near TVs nor cloth) (when i mean not close to TVs, i just mean dont have it stuck right next to the TV because the TVs heat will transfer to the PS3's heat.)<br>  <br>  2. Try to keep it away from the carpet (if u have tile its OK)<br>  <br>  3. Try not to let it over heat, if it over heats the dust will gather around the PS3 and attach to it.<br>  <br>  4. try to clean out some of the dust right now, turn off your console from the switch in the back, then hold the eject button, while your holding it turn on the PS3 from the back switch and the ps3 will turn on, a loud noise will begin (the ps3 is throwing dust out) and when its done, your PS3 will be flashing RED, then just reset the PS3 and the dust is out. (only works for 40 gig version)<br>  <br>  5)If you know your not gonna be off for at least 10 minutes or so, try to turn it off and cover the vents with something (usually just turning it off is ok)<br>  <br>  Dont do the manual Cleaner because the force of the particle getting sucked in the vacuum can rip off or loosen important pieces of hardware.|`|Jevw5cbqaa	Put a skinny piece of foam in front of the fan.|`|Qj53gkswaa	Cover it when idle.|`|LbPD1ZJHaa	switch off ps3 .use vacuum cleaner both sucker & blower. sucker for vents .blower for body.it worked for me. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEN41WUIv2I&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEN41WUIv...</a><br>  <br>  don't use any ps3 self clean feature.this feature recommended for unjamming the jammed disc.if you do, it will ruin the ps3 somehow & voids the warranty. dont take any risk !<br>  <br>  proof:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thatvideogameblog.com/2008/04/14/playstation-3-60gb-fan-test-may-be-playing-with-fire-literally/#more-3273" rel="nofollow">http://www.thatvideogameblog.com/2008/04...</a>|`|0e1e3b65b3c1de6ffdd4ebc197d8f144aa	Dust it using a feather duster or those static fluffy dusters as soon as u can see dust collecting on it.
VkAMAtEiaa	1) M4 with the acog is a lot better with the acog for many reasons,1 you can zoom in and out easier, 2 you can easily no scope someone, and 3 it makes it stronger becasue it kills in one hit , but its really hard, and it takes practice to use the acog i recommend you gather some friends online and ask them if they want to mess around with M40 Sniper ACOG (thats how i got used to it)<br>  PROOF <a href="http://tinyurl.com/9elzse" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/9elzse</a><br>  <br>  2)Call Of Duty 4 for me is the best game so far, becasue the ranking system and guns and maps are goo and well placed.<br>  <br>  3) An AK47  is not weaker with a Reddot, believe or not, if you feel that way, its really because the iron sight on the AK47 is the best one in the whole game, thats why to your mind it feels likea  faster kill.<br>  <br>  4)and the reasons so much countries such as Russia like wood is because wood is cheaper to manufacture then metal.<br>  Russians like things that explode like the Tsar bomb<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwlNPhn64TA&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwlNPhn64...</a><br>  <br>  5) It took me about 2 weeks to get to Level 55 because it was my first time experiencing COD4's brilliant Engine, I am now LVL 55 Prestige 10 and im glad, it took a long time about 6 months (in-game it took me 12 days)<br>  <br>  The best game modes to play to rank up at a fast pace is <br>  Search And Destroy (HC)<br>  or<br>  Head Quarters<br>  <br>  Infinity Ward will not be working on Call Of Duty 4 no more (Game Informer) they are done with it, so if they hack it, there goes COD4.<br>  <br>  If you need help on Call Of Duty 4 on the Playstation 3 system, feel free to add me, t3l3pr00f (the 00's are zeroes)|`|Hiasgb75aa	1) No. ACOG only shortens the range, but speeds up your scope view. Proof? No-scope with both and you'll get similar results<br>  <br>  2) For me? Yes<br>  <br>  3) Its exactly the same (4-6 bullets without stopping power and without enemy using Juggernaut)<br>  <br>  4) It was probably cheaper to manufacture guns using wood rather than metal<br>  <br>  5) My quickest was about 1 day 13 hours playing on HQ, Domination, Ground War and S&D<br>  <br>  There won't be any patches for Call of Duty 4 since Infinity Ward are now working on Modern Warfare 2. Don't worry, ACOGing isn't as hard as KZ2 makes it seem. I barely knew how to use ACOG when I started to learn how to no-scope and the gun isn't more powerful with an ACOG. ACOG only affects range and accuracy nothing else

You have choice also to continue using same cell phone even after contract period expires.  They just continue billing you ea. month.

Way back in early Nov. of 1977 I ordered an XG-9 from a store in New York. On Nov. 17, 1977 my daughter Elizabeth was born and later that afternoon the XG-9 arrived. I used that camera in Nov. of 2007 to photograph her 30th. birthday party.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	I own 14 cameras. I have a little collection going on here. My current digital cameras are a 30D and a 20D. I am due for an upgrade to the 20D though. As far as 35mm cameras I have a Canon Elan 7, two Nikkormats, a Mamiya Sekor, an Argus, and a Yashica point and shoot. For medium format I have a Hasselblad 500 C/M, two Rollei-flex cameras, a Ricohflex, and two very old Kodak bellows style cameras. I don't know the models but the patents are from 1910. Most are in working order. Everything seems to work on the Kodaks but I can't say that I have ever used them.|`|AA12323486	I have a Nikon FM2, a D70 and a D90.  I also have a Zenit that I don't use, and a whole bunch of cameras that used to belong to my grandfather.  Most are old box cameras.  Maybe half a dozen of those.  My smallest would be a keychain 110 camera.  Can't remember where I got that one.  I have an old stereo Kodak camera that my dad got for a bargain price because it was mislabeled at the store and he caused a stink with the manager.  And my most prized posession, my mom's old Argus Seventy Five box camera.<br>  <br>  I used to have a couple Canons--AV1 and A1, but I sold one a long time ago and lost the other one on an airplane.  I had another FM2 before the one I have now.  Lost that in checked luggage.  I had a Nikon F100 that I sold to buy lenses for my D70.  It was a great camera!  Best film camera I ever owned, but too big for my small hands to reach around to the dials and buttons.  I had a Nikon Coolpix that I gave to one of my sisters, and a long time ago I had an Olympus pocket 35mm camera that I gave to my little brother when he went off to war.<br>  <br>  Oh and I have a collection of cameras that don't take pictures.  Two are water squirters.  One is a clock.  One is made of Swarovski crystal.  One is ceramic and has a hinged bottom to store stuff in.  One is on a keychain.<br>  <br>  Okay, so I lost count way back.  I have a few cameras.|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	I owned a Miranda Sensorex 35mm SLR, a Konica rangefinder 35mm, a Nikon FE2 SLR 35mm, I now use a Sony 12X optical 6 megapixels, and also a Fuji 4X optical, 9 megapixels, soon to buy a digital SLR.|`|694bff6930252c5c87075cf1a039938caa	I have a Nikon F50, F60, N90S<br>  In Digital I have D50, D80 & D300<br>  In point and shoot I have a Fuji S7000, Fuji S9500 and an Olympus FE20,<br>  <br>  So that's 9 not counting the phone and PDA.<br>  <br>  My favorite would be the D300 I suppose.<br>  <br>  teef_au|`|BNRhUbuuaa	wow, i only have 1: a sony cybershot dsc-s90, so it's the one i use the most.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	In film I still own 3 Minolta 35mm cameras, one Bronica SQ 120mm camera, one Mamyia C-330 120mm camera and a 46mm long roll camera.<br>  <br>  In digital I still have my little Olympus 3040Z, Canon 300D, Canon 40D and a Canon G10.<br>  <br>  The 40D   is my favorite but the G10 is in my purse at all times.|`|162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	Film:  Canon AE-1, Nikon N2000, Nikon N6006, Nikon F100<br>  dSLR:  Nikon D80 and Nikon D300<br>  Film p&s: Olympus Stylus Epic and several old Canon, Nikon and Fuji models of various vintage<br>  Digicam:  Nikon 4300 and Canon Powershot G6<br>  <br>  I will begin using the D300 the most, although the F100 still has use from time to time.

WAOkgdj6aa	Neither, Wii Games are very repetitive and get very boring, very fast..<br>  <br>  and the Xbox 360 is useless. It is only good to buy if you are a Halo and Gears of War fan boy. You really want to spend 500 dollars for 2 games? It seems ridiculous. Other then that, it does nothing. You have to pay for online, controllers take batteries, the system overheats while playing DVDs, the menu system is confusing... Also, there are WAYYY too many hidden costs with the Xbox 360. It seems ridiculous to purchase Xboxlive, a WIRED controller, play and charge, wifi adapter (100 dollars to get wifi on your console!).. all that garbage for a console that has nothing going for it. I would buy a PS3. It has a blu-ray player, great games (Killzone 2 is coming out very soon, Resistance 2, LittleBigPlanet, Motorstorm.. etc), and is free to play online. The controllers are a lot cheaper in the long run because they do not take batteries and you do not have to buy play and charge kits for them at all. For the amount you are spending on a Xbox 360.. you can get a much better system for the same amount.|`|tzFkYLGqaa	Ditto.<br>  <br>  Only, that the Xbox 360 gets errors, so beware.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	get a 360 and the 360 comes with a 9 feet long internet cable <br>  it also comes with a 1 month free xbox live <br>  <br>  the only games you should get for the wii if you already do not own them are mario galaxy, paper mario thing and zelda|`|eYhiARdYaa	If you can afford buying a second console, and being able to buy new games as they come out for either as you like, I would say go for it. 360 is a great console with a great game library, but since I can only afford one at a time, I picked my Wii over my old 360:p<br>  <br>  If you can afford it, go for it, having the wii60 combo will give you the perfectly well-rounded gaming experience|`|q6uyloYdaa	Well, if there are a bunch of Wii games you actually want, then I guess it would be better to get stuff for the system you already have. But it's better to buy a new system you actually want instead of making yourself get games that you're not too excited about. In my opinion, get the 360.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	get a ps3 x-box 360 is notorious for crashing. plus other than halo you can get most of the same games and the ps3 plays blue ray. x-box 360 can't compete with ps3.|`|d04f79765d1fd481b2dc4b15699368edaa	If you are a gamer, you should get the 360. The Wii developers are too interestested in making a quick buck, while the more diverse (and better) games are on the 360.

AQ4b4Iilaa	Any dSLR photographer who knows his equipment will get you pictures similar to those, buy a cheap body and spend the rest on the lenses.<br>  <br>  My Sony A200 would produce macro and portrait pictures like that (but sharper) using a cheap 15 year old macro lens that I bought off eBay!  The picture of the horse is easy, the bird is standard 300mm zoom stuff.<br>  <br>  The tree one is 10mm, the lens is too expensive, you'd need a full frame.  I'd try a cheap fish-eye on my APS-C camera, with some photoshop effects to give it a wider appearance.  Full frame is the way to go on that.<br>  <br>  All of the photos, with a couple of eBay lenses and a bit of photoshop work, can be achieved on an entry level dSLR with the correct lenses.|`|eVptHOOBaa	If you download the images and look at their EXIF data (many programs can do that, even right clicking in explorer (XP, and I presume vista too) and selecting properties->summary->advanced will get you the name of a camera and focal length at which these were taken... All with different cameras and lenses. I spotted D80, D60, D200, and maybe more... The first image was taken at 10mm focal length, so that's a wide angle, 5th one at 300mm with a telephoto lens... The kit as needed for these specific photos will run you a few times your price limit....<br>  <br>  BUT... <br>  Even if you get all of these lenses (any body will really do, the lenses are what makes a difference) - don't expect to be able to get anywhere even close to the kind of pictures you showed. They were shot by professional photographers, who know really well what they were doing... So maybe you should spend most of the money on photography classes and books, rather than equipment... Because just like having a top of the line cookware won't make you a celebrity chef - having great photo equipment won't make you a professional photographer... About 80% of success of those images was in the skill of a photographer. The rest was equipment.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  LEM.|`|WOiH4CGvaa	Welcome to the world of photography! <br>  <br>  When I bought a canon 30D, I thought "price is no big deal", it was about $1400, with a lens. "A" lens, one single lens, <br>  <br>  Granted, you can buy second party lenses, but, there were a variety of them used in the pictures you linked to. And some of them, if you want top of the line lenses, blow your $1500 dollar budget, on a single lens!<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to discourage you, just cluing you into the facts! <br>  <br>  Get a DSLR, a lens, and be Ready to spend more money! :)

OtlaEVZjaa	A 2 year contract means you have to stay with  that company for  2 yrs. If you break the contract before its up you have to pay a pretty costly fee. You can get a new phone when your 2 yr contract is up. If you chose to a get a new phone now it will be expensive because your phone is not up for upgrading. If you get a new phone now it will add another 2 yrs on to what is left of the contract your on now. So if you've only had this contract for a year you will have 3 yrs til your contract is up. That is if you get the phone through that company. Thats how they get you.  Now if you wanna buy a phone say like off of ebay or something then it wont extend your contract or anything. You can just switch your plan from the phone you have now to the new one.|`|k1kfAwfPaa	you have to stay with the phone for two years and pay for the bills every time you upgrade the phone they extend the two years from the time you get the new phone<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|4nEel3dQaa	yes it means you stay with your company for two years and Im pretty sure you cannot change your phone until 3 months before the contract is up and if you do then you have to pay for all the months that you would of until your contract is up.

602eb8b9f3eeb9a4df562245f12b7f11aa	Depending on where you live in the country your verizon insurance could be either Lockline or Asurion, in which case water damage is covered but there will be a 50.00 deductible to get your replacement phone.  Both of these companies insurance shows up on your monthly bill for around 4 to 6 dollars per month.<br>  Some stores also offer a third party insurance that you pay outright at the time you buy your phone, probably at around 75 to 100 dollars.  These usually replace your phone with no deductible but can vary drastically on whether or not they will cover water damage.|`|4ppm2b1gaa	It all depends on phone and the insurance you have that it comes with, or if you purchased any additional insurance.

1F6KJt0oaa	Go with the 20D.  It is currently in the entry level category it is free I am assuming cause your dad said he would give it to you and it will definitely be more expandable.  The G10 is a formidable point and shoot but formidable or not it is still a point and shoot and is not going to give you the freedom to expand.  I am not completely opposed to learning on a point and shoot as some are especially not one with manual focus option which is a cool feature of that camera.  However, I do think you are limited in the scope of things you can learn with it.  When you start experimenting and learning about the camera you will learn quickly and with an SLR or DSLR you will be able to add lenses, accessories, and what not to your system but with a point and shoot you will basically be limited to the features built into the camera and a few cheesy screw on lens adapters.  The 20D will be a nice starting point for you.  Go for it.|`|WOiH4CGvaa	I'm voting for the 20D. <br>  <br>  You can just put it in the "green square" until you feel more comfortable making your own decisions on shutter speed, aperture, and iso. <br>  <br>  It's a much better camera than the G10, if you want to learn the craft. <br>  <br>  And the 30, 40, 50D's, 5D, 5D II, 1Ds III, 1D III, all operate more or less the same way! Learn the 20, and you'll be up to speed on all of the "higher" end Canon EOS series!|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Rebel XSi is far better.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Take the 20D it uses the same lenses the XSi does and it is a better camera ..

The Canon DSLR's (20D and XSi) have sensors that are over 15 time larger than the G10, have interchangeable lenses and complete control over the exposures or fully automatic if you wish.<br>  <br>  The G10 has only one lens and the user cannot control the shutter speed nor the aperture ... all exposures are controlled by the camera ... period.<br>  <br>  Comparisons:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_post.asp?method=sidebyside&cameras=canon_eos450d,canon_eos20d,canon_g10&show=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_...</a><br>  <br>  My thought is that your brother is impressed by the pixel count on the G10 ... it is a marketing ploy ....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a><br>  <br>  To double the resolution available on the 20D, you would have to find camera with a 32 mp sensor.

If so, get the XSi... if not, get the G10.|`|AA11096257	If you want to go fully into the DSLR market then go with the Rebel xsi, it is an entry level DSLR, but if you want to take RAW photos without the DSLR hassle then the G10, but the G9 is a better camera. The only problem with getting a G10 or G9 is that they cost as much as some DSLR bodies. If money is no object, then go with the Rebel xsi. hope this helps|`|RjY4R9WCaa	If you can get the 20D for free, take it and use your money for lenses, tripod, external flash, etc. If you're intimidated by the dSLR, the G10 is a very good complement to it. With respect to previous posters, the G10 does let you control camera settings (aperture, shutter speed, white balance, etc.). Plus, it's small enough that you'll be more likely to carry it with you. The best camera is the one you have with you.<br>  <br>  (PS If you want movies, you'll need a G10. If you like to compose on the LCD screen, again the G10 will do that more easily that the dSLRs.)

tjg7hLbMaa	Lithium-ion batteries should not be frequently fully discharged and recharged ("deep-cycled"), but this may be necessary after about every 30th recharge to recalibrate any electronic charge monitor (e.g. a battery meter). This allows the monitoring electronics to more accurately estimate battery charge.|`|602eb8b9f3eeb9a4df562245f12b7f11aa	While Lithium Ion is better than the old Ni-Cad batteries, they do still need some care.  They will not retain a memory, so if you are down by a little bit and plug it in each night it won't start only lasting a day like the old ni-cads.  However, be aware that ALL rechargable batteries only have a finite number of charges so your battery will last longer if you only charge it when needed.  If you are down to 2 bars of battery and you know you will use your phone a lot the next day, go ahead and charge it.  Just try not to do that all the time.  This may help you if you have a landline on a cordless phone.  Those are still ni-cads so instead of always putting the phone back in the cradle, lay it next to the cradle and only charge it when it beeps.<br>  Also, Lithium Ion batteries tend to hold a charge longer when not in use as much but they don't do as well in extreme cold so not great for the grandmother who leaves her phone in the glovebox of her car.  Of course, this is never a good idea for electronics anyway as all it takes is to go from a very cold glovebox to a very warm house and it causes condensation and that water damages the phone and voids the warranty.<br>  It is better to turn your phone off if using a house charger because the AC charge is a trickle charge and your indicator doesn't realize that when you charge it with the phone turned on.  This is why sometimes your phone will say "full charge" but then drop 2 bars with a 5 minute phone call.  This is almost always from charging it while turned on using a house charger.  Car chargers do not cause the battery indicator to "lie" like that but they may cause the phone and battery to get warm.  This is normal as long as it doesn't get too warm.|`|rQOTrw5kaa	Nah,, not really unless your bored or if you forgot about it on your charger.
rQOTrw5kaa	well if its free durring those hours than you shouldn be charged, if they due have them reverse it and have them put it in writing so you wont have that problem again
XcF4L6KMaa	Yes you have to have the data package for the phone to work correctly.|`|I1tnVvVGaa	i had a blackberry with vzw....i say get the more expensive plan....with the cheaper one, you can literally check like, one e-mail then they start charging you. with the more expensive plan, you get unlimited internet. it's worth it, believe me.|`|rQOTrw5kaa	Typically you are required to add a data plan when you activate a PDA  / smart phone. Especially with VZW.  Although with SPC/nextsmell    it is not necessary.|`|GkE1J8kGaa	Yes the phone wont work properly without it. alot of the newer phones are like that my boyfriend bought the G1 today and he had to buy the data package for $35.|`|jqdDFwGnaa	if your buying from verizon for 200 with the new contract then the terms are that you must get the data plan.
tjg7hLbMaa	If you hold down the 1 key on your keypad it should connect you to the voice mail service.<br>  <br>  A lot of companies use the last 4 digits of your phone number as a temporary password. You will need to contact your service provider to get your voice mail password if that's not it.|`|I91lFgTdaa	I don't have Alltel but I have Verizon which is powered by Alltel. Mostly what you can do is call *86 on your phone which brings you to Voicemail then it will ask you to set up a 4 digit code just type the 4 digit code you want and save it. Then just follow the instructions further on and you should be set up.|`|602eb8b9f3eeb9a4df562245f12b7f11aa	If you have never set up your voicemail before it should give you the prompts to set up new voicemail automatically when you press and hold down the "1" for a couple of seconds.  This will lead you to a recording like "you have reached a number that the voicemail has not been set up"  DON'T wait for that message to finish speaking.  Interupt it by pressing "#" then it should talk you thru setting up your voicemail and asking you to create a passcode and so on.  If you still have trouble just stop in your local store and they will help you.|`|Ezv5DrJwaa	hOLD THE 1 KEY

9bSCOZB1aa	You should be fine with an average sized guitar, but I really suggest you go to your local music store and sit down with a couple of guitars before choosing. Picking a guitar isn't like buying a pair of pants; you could play a children's guitar or an abnormally large guitar. It doesn't matter, as long as you can comfortably play it.

Though everyone does have Limewire...<br>  Torrents are actually safer than Limewire btw.<br>  But I'm sure you could find some online, if you're able to connect the phone to the computer and add it on manually.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped a bit, if at all... <br>  Best of luck :]

d3f352fe854d43d7b42addd84dbe08b8aa	Anytime your charger is not lighting up on your phone then that means that there is a problem with the connection.  It can be your charger isnt working or it can be your phone has something wire or circuit not completing the charge.  You should contact tmobile to get it replaced.  usually it wont cost any money except sometimes for shipping.  Still you should be fine once you call them.

f9f7ae4f899136d8207ae54974ede247aa	I've always heard that letting your ipod completely die once in a while will help the battery last longer so you avoid sending it away to apple or having to buy a brand new one.  I've never heard that it can give a longer charge.  I've had my 3rd Gen iPod Nano for a couple years now I've never had to replace or send it away, the original battery still works.

Like in Maine (where I live), evryone will get their phones in April, but won't be able to use them untill May 17th (the day the phones will work). When I ordered my phones there was a chart tat said the date when each state was switching. I also called a Verizon store to verify all this, and they said evrything I read.
tjg7hLbMaa	You are not charged per minute for using the Internet. You are charged based on the amount of information you have downloaded.<br>  <br>  The ringtones and wallpaper you have downloaded may be free to grab from a website, however, AT&T will charge you the Internet costs related to grabbing those things.<br>  <br>  It really depends on the size of what you've downloaded.<br>  <br>  Ringtones are generally between 100 to 150 kb each.<br>  Wallpapers are generally between 30 to 50 kb each.<br>  <br>  The information I'm finding online indicates that it may be around 1 cent per kilobyte on AT&T so you're looking at around $1.30 to $2.00 plus whatever data you used going to and from the site. Keep in mind that this information is for the average size of a ringtone and wallpaper. The ringtone or wallpaper that you have downloaded may be significantly less or more depending on the compression used.|`|k1kfAwfPaa	THEY CHARGE PER HOW MANY BYTES ARE TRANSFERRED|`|xj5lIwaHaa	It really depends on how long it took like there is a big difference between 1 second on the internet and five minutes on the internet & how many bytes you used.|`|xXVnOYjbaa	They charge by how many bytes of information your phone downloads.<br>  Since you downloaded ringtones that is quite alot.<br>  AT&T charges $0.01 per KB downloaded<br>  My friend downloaded 4 ringtones and he didnt have it and he got $70 charge to his account.|`|ws2zuHfaaa	Well you downloaded bytes from the internet, so Ouch thats gonna cost you money without media net unlimited

The Rebel XSI is a lighter, beginner SLR with a three inch screen ( the 20d has a 1.8" screen ), live live, and a lot more new features you'll appreciated. The 20d will give you better high sensitivity performance, better build, and a faster burst rate. The XSI is also a very good camera.

What you can do is purge it from your ps3 by doing a system restore, but you don't have to.<br>  <br>  All you really need to do is add a user, and create your own account. It has to be a master account, not a sub-account for the seller's account which wouldn't work without the pass. You need an email address to do it.

1afbbdf95ac24d4f09b64f9e1a7930afaa	To get a usable guitar sound, you really need to play through an amp and put a mic in front of the amp. If you plug your guitar into, say a boss distortion pedal and then from the pedal into a computer it won't sound like what you would expect it to sound like. It will be really weird sounding- like tinny and thin. You need to go Guitar>Amp>Microphone>Computer. Pretty much the best mic to use is an sm57, which is great because they're really cheap, under 100 bucks. Just put the mic right up against the grill cloth on the amp. If you don't have an amp and a mic, then you will probably not ever get a sound you're happy with.

FbwyvwEYaa	Cool, you also play 360. <br>  <br>  Lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  Well I have an Xbox and I get the red rings of death, often.<br>  <br>  It sucks.<br>  <br>  Red ring of death is the name for when your xbox 360 over heats due to over-use. It is given away by red rings appearing around the power button when you try to turn on your 360. <br>  <br>  There are some tricks that keep it at bay for a short time, but nothing in reality, the only way to prevent the red rings is by never playing your xbox more than 12-13 hours without breaks, just because you can do an all niter doesn't mean your 360 can. But if you do get plagued by the rings, you will have to send your xbox to Microsoft for a 2-month repair.<br>  <br>  Also, you could just get an xbox 360 elite, they come with 2 internal cooling units, so it's guaranteed that they will not be affected by the red rings.<br>  <br>  <br>  There's nothing to prevent it.<br>  <br>  The red ring of death occurs when you use your Xbox 360 too much, for long hours, mostly 10 and up. Miccrosoft have extended the warranty to 3 years, so when you buy an 360 and you get the "red ring of death" or any malfunction, just send it to Microsoft and they're repair it for you for free.<br>  <br>  Anyways, to prevent the Red Ring of Death, you need to store your 360 in a cool room and use it for a period of hours everyday or try to give it a day of a break and use it the next day. Use it wisely.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped +)|`|AA12133586	red ring mean it time for you to send in your xbox to miscrosoft so they can fix it for you.. it can take at least 4 weeks to get it back..<br>  <br>  red ring can mean overheating, faulty harddrive, bad computer chip, and ect ect|`|QIlhmWwBaa	the red ring of death is when your xbox does not work any more because over heating <br>  <br>  i honestly do not think that is a sign of it im guessing there might be something wrong with the game since its a used game<br>  try playing other games and if they work fine then is the game and not the xbox|`|akta3gq7aa	Well it's not Red Ring of Fire, it's Red Ring of Death, and it's nicknamed RRoD. The two most common things, that I know of, is either your CPU or your GPU overheating, or power failure. Power failure is easy to fix. Just make sure your Xbox is plugged in properly. And overheating is way more common. Microsoft stated that 60% of Xbox's will get the RRoD. I got my RRoD because of my GPU. My GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) got fried, and I called them to place a repair. You should expect it in about a month. Try buying an Inter Cooler if you want to avoid the RRoD.<br>  <br>  All Xbox's come with free warranty. The 20GB model comes with a 1 year free warranty, and if it get the RRoD, it turns into a 3 year warranty for your console. If you have the 60GB model, you start off with a 3 year warranty.

bhLM6PNqaa	No, if you have a service such as Directv, the purchase of a converter box is not necessary. It converts the signal for you. That's the benefit of having cable/dish/etc. As far as the tv goes, I'm not sure if your television is digital. Perhaps it says something about it in the manual, or maybe you could get a technician to check and see, just incase.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	If you receive all of your TV from DirecTV, no.<br>  If you receiver some channels from antenna, then probably.|`|2KjMxlmJaa	No, the Direct TV service does the digital to analog conversion for you.

tjg7hLbMaa	The prices of the phone have a little bit of leeway (especially in store where they want to make the sale) but the data packages go into the system as one price and one price only.<br>  <br>  An alternative for you might be to talk to the cancellation department a couple months after receiving the data package. Inform them that you believe the price is too expensive and that you'll have no choice but to cancel your service (if you have a competing offer from another company, that's always good). Often they'll start handing out discounts for a period of time (if you're somewhat of a decent customer).|`|ikywy3uEaa	No,unless you're att's leader|`|k1kfAwfPaa	no

0AUTZt5Aaa	Why you should get a PS3 and NOT a Xbox 360<br>  <br>  The *expected* lifetimes of current home video game consoles:<br>  <br>  Xbox 360--2005-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it<br>  Wii-2006-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it<br>  Playstation 3-2015 (Sony said they made it to last 10 years, so 2006+10 years=2016, round it down just to be safe), you'll get 7 years out of it.<br>  <br>  In short, it has better reliability, multimedia capabilities, a large list of exclusives and more coming out in 2009 and in the future and it has over-the-top graphical capabilities (google “Heavy Rain”). And to those who say the Xbox 360 is cheaper, well then just look at the following list:<br>  <br>  With the PS3, you get:<br>  -A Blu-Ray player, which if you wanted one of equal value would blow at least a $700 hole in your wallet<br>  -Free online service<br>  -An ever-growing list of exclusives, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.—in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time, 128 VS 128)<br>  -More flexible in terms of hardware, e.g. swappable HDD, USB mini cable, etc.<br>  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi<br>  -Web browser<br>  -A super sleek system complete with chrome trim and a slot loading disc drive<br>  -HDMI 1.3, Xbox 360 only has HDMI 1.2 (major difference despite only a 0.1 difference)<br>  <br>  With the Xbox 360, you get:<br>  -DVD Player/upconverter<br>  -Xbox live, which is $50/year, and not even worth it<br>  -Halo 3 and Gears of War 2 (that’s a lot of exclusives compared to the PS3, if you ask me: P)<br>  -Umm…can’t really say anything about non-proprietaryness, because Microsoft inflates the prices for their accessories. 120GB for $150? With the PS3, you can upgrade to 500GB for $110!<br>  -A 1 in 3 failure rate (it's not "if", it's "when")<br>  -Many people are on their 5th or 6th 360's already because of RROD, and my friend is on his 12th!<br>  <br>  So here’s a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  Console $400<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $55<br>  Charger $2-10--any USB mini cable will do<br>  Total: $517 ($2 USB mini cable)<br>  <br>  Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)<br>  <br>  Xbox 360:<br>  Console $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $60<br>  Play and Charge kit x2 $60 (for 2 controllers)<br>  Xbox Live $60<br>  Wi-Fi $100<br>  Total: $640<br>  <br>  That’s not cheaper, so get a grip on it! The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So there's lots of wiggle room in the future for much more brighter, detailed and massive environments.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360’s potential. And they look the same, if not better on the PS3. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. It’s just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.<br>  <br>  Xbox Live VS PSN? The only thing you are missing is cross voice chat, which can easily be solved by using a telephone, or even in PSN’s V3.00 update, which we will be seeing soon enough.<br>  <br>  The PS3 has sold 21 million units in 2 years. The Xbox 360 has sold 28 million in 3 years. Plus a 33% failure rate, that means that 9.24 million units are either refurbished ones or replacements. So really, the amount of one-time buyers is about 19 million. So really, the PS3 has sold 21 million in 2 years, while the Xbox 360 has sold 19 in 3 years, and the PS3 has a higher face value ($199.99 vs. $399.99)<br>  <br>  So in conclusion, the PS3 is better—you get the most bang for your buck, and it's an incredibly advanced all-in-one home media center hub. You can even install Linux or Windows XP and use it as a computer—legally! While with the Xbox 360, Microsoft will ban your 360 from certain things, if you install the OS at all (just try to bypass the security).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  --PS3 expert--|`|jxpV13rTaa	PS3 <br>  -one of the best blu ray players on the market (if not THE best)<br>  -free online play<br>  -rechargeable controllers<br>  -VERY reliable and durable<br>  -will have more games than the 360 at the end of 2009 (with bigger and better titles like killzone 2, drakes fortune 2, etc.)<br>  -online play is great<br>  -amazing graphics<br>  -great selection of games<br>  -game discs are blue ray (which makes better graphics than the 360)<br>  -only 0.2% defective rate after opened from box<br>  <br>  360<br>  -larger online community<br>  -online costs money to use<br>  -30% defective rate after opened from box (yes, 30!)<br>  -breaks down and creates the ring of death (scoaring of the discs until they arent readable)<br>  -amazing graphics<br>  -great selection of games<br>  -has HD DVD player (which is obsolete and useless because they only make Blu Ray DVDs, not HD DVDs.)<br>  <br>  Dont waste your time with an xbox they will just break. i have owned both for a long time and the PS3 is by far the better choice. so its 100 dollars more...big deal. you get a larger hard drive and an amazing blu ray player. dont listen to bias people. you will get xbox lovers saying how the ps3 is junk. they are beyond ignorant. they are both amazing but the ps3 triumphs|`|QIlhmWwBaa	i own both consoles man and honestly the only good games so far for the ps3 are some of the same that are available for the 360 <br>  <br>  the only exception is little big planet and killzone 2 but killzone 2 is really not as good as halo 3 and resistance 2 is crap and metal gear is a good game but it gets boring after getting done with it <br>  the only reason to get the ps3 would be if you want a blu ray player and the only game that looks really awesome is god of war 3 which would be probably the game of the year but is still not out <br>  <br>  both consoles are great but the 360 has better games|`|4Vjyzommaa	Oh trust me, the PS3 has great games. maybe not as many games are on the ps3 as is on the 360. but there are games that are incredible like Killzone 2, Resistance 1 & 2, Uncharted, Haze, Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, Alone in the Dark (which is much better that it's 360 counterpart).

The only advantage ps3 has for online is its free. Other than that the connections suxs and no one ever has a ps3. For games the 360 still has so manny out their and ps3 only has a handful good ones right now. If you want to wait it out ps3 will still have better graphics and will eventual realese some good games but its gonna be at least 2 years before they will be able to compete at all. By that time they will be close to making the new xbox. The choice is a no brainer to stick with 360. Their is only 2 exclusive good titles and that are mgs 4 and reistance. but to really trade it in for 2 games is retard. 360 still has halo 3, gta 4, gears of war, oblilivion, lego games, dynasty warriors, wrestling games, bioshock, fallout 3, fable 2, madden, ncaa, basketball. Point is that they all have same type of games but u alrdy own a 360 so why sell one and pay more in long run.<br>  <br>  ps. Weird as it is I got 360 when it first came out and still works just as good as day I bought it. So dont give the ring of death bs.|`|YymOCkWQaa	Well, I have a 360, I enjoy it pretty much.

ITS THE BEST SHOOTER EVER . the gameplay  feels extremely real and u feel like u are actually in the warfield with ur assault rifle. the graphics ae awesome and the atmosphere is great . multiplayer is considered as the king of online games. killzone 2 reviews are awesome with 95% on metacritic and 94 on gamerankings.  I have cod 4, halo3 , gta4 on 360 and many more on 360 as i got it 2 years ago. on my ps3 i got cod4, gta4, and metal gear solid 4. honestly ,ps3 versions are better becuz of  no lag and better online function. i dnt buy any more 360 games cuz im thinking of selling it and getting an itouch . i thought about it and decided to keep ps3 my game system. on game websites, they are saying ps3 is the future console. I also heard that sequels of great games like gran turismo , uncharted, and god of war are coming out. For me xbox 360 kinda feels old becuz of its games. ps3 is getting games that can only be run on ps3 . i heard gta5 gonna be a ps3 exclusive . <br>  <br>  if you talk about online , they feel the same , but 360 live times out and this never happened on my ps3. there is a great playstatin store with great games , demos , themes , add ons, . there is also a video store where you can buy, rent or sell blu ray, or dvd movies. the selection is pretty cool. <br>  <br>   <br>  SO i conclude by saying , yea trade it for ps3 cuz PS3 is the future console with games like killzone2 , and god of war 3|`|uXrfRMluaa	360's dont last very long and have exellent online play. the 360 has way more capabilities and with constant updates it just gets better. although the ps3 plays blueray and plays games which saves you money because bluerays are relativley expencive they dont compare to 360|`|8IiygRi8aa	Playstation 3 is the best by far, 360 is more popular tho<br>  I had a 360 and then 4 months later had a red ring of death and since then my ps3 that i bought has worked like a charm|`|okCcxCWJaa	PSTriple if you're into fighters and JRPG's and want a generally better media experience. 360 if what you want is shooter, personally I only play shooters on the PC.|`|6KlNjzbxaa	Metal gear solid is the best game for ps3 and little big planet(its not crap its really fun.|`|HCaAUig4aa	idk i have both but i have ever felt like playing em, but my brothers do, i always see them on the 360 cuz his friends r always on online.|`|61e53bb91485a8bd3c6701d7a90c4da2aa	PS3 in any way.|`|xQAF7HNXaa	360. because it has almost the same graphics as the PS3 and the 360 has ALOT of good games|`|gl4MePuDaa	hardware  ps3<br>  <br>  xbox    for fun|`|aROiy2Gnaa	trade ur 360 in and get a ps3 because they rock

uoFutlWmaa	Omgosh same thing happened to me when I was 13. I got my ipod on christmas and everything and I also thought my parents were gonna kill me, when I lost my ipod. However, I sucked it up and told my parents that my ipod got stolen and after they yelled at me (ex:"why would you even bring your ipod to a party? etc..) they told my cousin who went to the party with me that if he found my ipod, he'll get 50 bucks. It was like 2 weeks later when I finally got my ipod back. I think telling them is so much easier than trying to work and you can sort of repay them by doing the dishes and other chores around the house that they assign you.|`|jVi1uJ8Laa	I hate to say this. But look up online combination's of pills that get you high, put them in bags and sell them at school for top dollar. Or if you have access to the better pills sell them. For weed, keep it in a plastic bag, wrap the bag in duct tape and spray it with lysol and get germ-x constantly. If you have a PS2 take out the expansion pack door and put the hash in there. If your school does a drug search ditch the pot. Flush it or hide it outside to get later. Or throw it away as a LAST resort. Charge around the same price as others at school. You need access to a gun and carry a switch blade when your outside of school. You can get these at a hardware store for very cheap. Once you've got $150 stop. Stop. Because once your an adult you can get shot. Expect 1-3 years if caught depending on the amount you have. Good luck. Or you could always steal something.

tjg7hLbMaa	You can use your existing wifi connection with the iPhone without any additional charges. However, if you are planning on doing this ensure that you're asking Rogers to BLOCK your Internet access. This will block access through the GSM network only, allowing you to only use WIFI. The main issue we're seeing with people using only wifi is that if their connection drops it's a seamless connection to switch over to the gsm network. We're also seeing a lot of people installing applications that use the Internet all the time (like setting the weather application to update on a regular basis then being shocked when they get a $1000 phone bill). Block it if you're not going to get a package.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that the iPhone was intended to be used as a device that's connected to the Internet 24/7 (and the majority of the applications will not work as intended if you are not connected to the Internet). If you're planning on just using it with wifi, don't buy into the hype and just get yourself a regular phone. You're already at home with a computer anyway.|`|k1kfAwfPaa	no you don't it comes with the data plan|`|v46BgxQZaa	The Wifi option is built in your phone so you dont need a network to use that option and you will not get charged for that.

tjg7hLbMaa	Unlimited on device browsing is not compatible with the iPhone. It is only available for WAP browsing on specific websites (websites specifically designed for mobile phones and available through the Rogers portal). Since the iPhone uses regular HTTP Internet (like you see whenever you use a computer) and not WAP, the unlimited browsing will not work.<br>  <br>  In regards to your Edge/3G reference, that simply refers to the speed at which information is downloaded to your phone and is not the reason why you cannot use the Internet. You should have access to Internet services regardless of which network you are using (Edge or 3G). It sounds like your Internet settings are incorrect within the phone. Rogers will be able to provide you with the correct settings. I am leery about providing these settings to "fix" this issue for you because if you do get access to the Internet (without fixing your on-device browsing thing) you will be charged pay per use for any internet you use on your phone (at 5 cents per kb).<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to call Rogers asap regarding your data options. I've seen individuals sign up for the on-device mobile browsing option and end up with huge bills due to the amount of data the iPhone uses (I'm talking thousands of dollars, not hundreds).<br>  <br>  EDIT: (in response to your additional details) The best advice I can give you is to call Rogers Wireless and discuss your options with them. You do not need to have an iPhone plan in order to get Internet for the iPhone. This is a constant issue that is happening at the stores (because they get commission for locking you into a 3 year agreement). You can get a regular data plan and use it with your iPhone. I didn't notice before that you were on a prepaid plan. Those don't work well for the iPhone at all. That may be why your Internet is not functioning properly (I'm not involved with prepaid at all). Your best bet is to get a regular plan and add a regular data option. If it was a Rogers phone originally then you should have no issues using the Internet with it. If it wasn't Rogers originally you may need to program in the Rogers Internet settings.<br>  <br>  Just an additional note, There's a $17.50 (plus SAF and 911) plan that may suit your needs. It's 200 daytime minutes, unlimited evenings and weekends (starting at 6pm) and available if you are a member of one of many organizations (including Petro Points, Aeroplan, Airmiles, CAA, Esso and many more).

PaSJJkYHaa	The phone is over $400 but to use it internationally it must be GSM compatible and you must be on a GSM network such as AT&T,T-Mobile, or Rogers to name a few. Rates usually run about .30 cents or more a minute.  <br>  <br>  Check the website of your desired providers to see their rates and plans for international calling.|`|I91lFgTdaa	The Storm is $199 + 2 Yr Contract with Verizon Wireless and around $500 without contract. The phone does feature Sim Capabilities, but only in the Asia, Europe and other Countries. But don not plan to use it with AT&T or T-Mobile. The phone's Radio frequency does not work with AT&T or T-Mobile.<br>  <br>  You need to find out what kind or capabilities the carrier in India has. Then find out their charges.<br>  <br>  If the carrier uses Sim cards just buy a Sim card from them and a plan or Pre-Paid Plan and insert the Card into the back of the BB Storm.

hSwqfaF1aa	If you wait long enough something new will always come out.  I have been playing the waiting game to.  I could have gotton a upgrade over a year ago, but I was waiting on an Att phone with keyboard, that does not use the $30 data plan.  I got all excited about the Matrix, propel, and quickfire.  I waited till they came out, was dispointed at the quickfire, the propels screen was to small for these old eys (don't know how Ozzy uses it), loved the matrix, but the reviews had the phone falling apart.<br>  <br>  Then my wife tells me she wants to buy my phone as a christmas present.  Been reading the reviews on the eternity, everything seems good.  The only cons that I have read I can live with,  no speed dial (but a software upgrade in the furture), no voice dial (don't use it anyway), can't add widgets (but hope this changes in the future, someting like the Iphone app store would be nice)<br>  <br>  Now I just have to wait till Christmas day to start using it.  I love to text, play music, and browse the web, all things the eternity can do.<br>  <br>  So my advice is get a smart phone (wife uses BB curve, I love it just don't want the $30 data plan)  if you don't want a smart phone, and don't need a physical keyboard, go with the eternity.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Try researching them on amazon.com.

If you are in the USA you can contact AT&T. If you're in Canada you can contact either Rogers or Fido. These are the companies that sell the iPhone. If you are in another country you may want to research which companies are selling it there.<br>  <br>  What you will need to do is open up the back of the phone and get the IMEI number. It's generally written under the battery (look for a barcode and it's written in the smallest writing known to man, hehe). This is a 16 digit serial number that is unique to every phone. You can give that number to the company and they should be able to look up who owns that particular phone.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, if you are able to remove the SIM card (there's a special tool to remove it for iPhones so you may not be able to) you can give the company that number as well to track the user of the phone.|`|199958d000855eb2c64211989172364daa	Bring it to the police or back to the carrier. Either way they will try to contact an owner of the phone.|`|2KjMxlmJaa	Take it into an At&T store.  They can hook it to something that will let them read the ESN.  With that, they can locate the owner.
hSwqfaF1aa	I am not sure of what the vu has that the eternity doesnt have, but i can tell you some things that the eternity does have.<br>  <br>  It has illumination, so when you get a text or call the bottom flashes either blue, orange, pink, red, or green.<br>  It has a birthday widget, so when one of your contacts have a birthday coming up it'll let you know.<br>  Easy typing keyboard.<br>  The touch screen is EXTREMELY responsive.<br>  You are able to customize the font of your phone.<br>  also, make your inbox messages smaller or bigger using the sound rocker.<br>  Camera takes great pics too!<br>  and much much more! That is just a little of the great things the eternity has!<br>  <br>  Hope i helped a bit :]|`|k1kfAwfPaa	get the samsung eternity|`|v46BgxQZaa	First of all I think that the Quickfire is too thick and the camera resolution is kind of low it is only 1.3 megapixels. The Vu feels cheap and has a 2.0 megapixels camera. So I would go with the Samsung Eternity even though it is a little bit more expensive. It has a 3 megapixels camera and a lot more interesting options.

1F6KJt0oaa	Wait are you asking which of these two is better or what is the best digital camera?  The best digital camera is probably the Hasselblad H3dII-50.  If you are asking between these two well it depends.  Sony uses Nikon glass which I think is better than Canon class.  Though Canon makes nice solid cameras that are easier to use so I think Canon wins the camera battle.  I don't know much about the sony bodies.  Personally I like the up and comer Pentax but mostly because they were slow to enter the digital field and kept making film cameras for a good long while.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Sony|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I'm a photographer and I have used both and on the highest ISO and with the setting Supper fine Canon takes the best pictures.|`|apOLOQdnaa	Buying a digital camera, I would suggest you to go for Canon digital camera.

qEy34ueZaa	First: the battery has to be of the "rechargeable type", otherwise you will need to buy a new one. Second: if it is the rechargeable type you are out of luck, because the camera's owner has the recharging unit (a box like unit. You put the batteries inside with the + and - properly oriented, and plug it on a wall outlet. It usually charges in about 3 hours).<br>  Advice: if you ever buy your own camera, make sure it uses size AA batteries, usually two of them. Reason: they are available everywhere, and you will never get stuck. With my Canon Power Shot A540 (decent), I always carry two spare batteries in the pouch (rechargeable, which are a lot cheaper).|`|i5OVORXgaa	That doesn't give us enough information about the camera.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	A model number would have been a good start. <br>  <br>  If the camera uses a Li-ion battery, you need to use the charger that is designed to be used with the camera.<br>  <br>  If it uses AA cells, you can use common alkaline cells or rechargeable NiMH AA batteries ... those are available as a kit .. 4 batteries and a charger for under $30 ... in either case you will have to use the correct charger ... talk to your friend and get the charger

tjg7hLbMaa	The warranty covers manufacturers defects, not people who can't take care of their equipment.<br>  <br>  There's no way you can "break" it so it falls under warranty. Any sort of abusive use is not covered. The fact that the back is all scratched up will not work in your favour at all (even if you do manage to crack the screen like your friend did) because they'll see the marks and just assume you've been rough with the phone and haven't been taking care of it properly.<br>  <br>  Believe me, Apple has seen it all and are quite good at telling the difference.|`|Gem96NQyaa	The iPhone actually has quite a few sensors that trip if you intentionally try to break it... most notably, the water sensor, which if tripped completely voids your warranty.  Apple's not that stupid.

Fd0vQ6HDaa	The best way to get the answer to this is to call customer service and they will have the answer to all ur questions.|`|8WMSaf98aa	What do you do with your phone? If you want a smart phone that has a wonderful media UI (user interface) for listening to music or watching movies, or you are a Mac user, an iPhone would be great. But if you do a lot with the camera of a phone, you might want to get a different one, since the iPhone doesn't take video. Also, other smart phones have things like mobile Office, so if you are going to be doing a lot of work on the road (Mobile banking, presentations, ect.), you might want a blackberry. If you are uncomfterbal with using JUST a touch screen, or your thumbs are just too big, you might want something that has a qwerty keypad instead of a touch screen. Cool alternatives:Pantech Duo,LG INCITE,BlackBerry? Bold,Palm Centro. Anything you pick, just make sure you spend a good amount of time in the store with it before you buy.

That Sony has "Digital Media Port".. What is that? well, Philips clearly have the USB Drive reader, you can play your movies and music from a USB drive.<br>  4. Philips can play more file formats like DiVX, DiVX ultra, no need to convert your files to DVD.<br>  5. The speakers in Philips are plugged directly, no hassle in clipping those red and black wires.<br>  6.

Philips is kinda quiet at this kind of model. <br>  <br>  But If you want better Performance go with brands like Denon, Onkyo, Yamaha, and if you want the best Sony Dream Home, Marantz, Pioneer Elite and lots more but these cost over $200 of course.<br>  <br>  Also remember Cables also matter and the way you set them up.|`|r8HAHhgkaa	actually neither. Why limit yourself to just two. Im glad you didnt just jump to bose which is very overpriced. but you forgot the number one rule. good electronics companies typically produce very bad speakers. They are mass produced in a factory with no regard to performance. they are made to meet the demand. I would recommend a more respected brand such as Onkyo or Yamaha which have great systems that dont cost that much if you are looking for entry level gear.

602eb8b9f3eeb9a4df562245f12b7f11aa	You should have a lithium ion battery, which should be fine as long as the life of each charge is still acceptable to you.  When charging with a car charger it isn't abnornal for your phone to get pretty warm but on a house charger it shouldn't get warm enough to really feel much.  If it gets too warm, such as warmer than say, wrapping your hands around a mug of warm coffee, then you may want to take your phone, battery and house charger to a store so that they can try out a different charger and battery so that you fix the correct problem.  Many times a battery is fine and the charger is causing the issue.  A store can usually figure it out by process of elimination.<br>  Good luck.

It doesn't have the newest features or the best quality.  Major complaints include: soft or blurry picture compared to other brands, uneven and grayish blacks, and higher than average failure rates.  The advantage of Insignias are that they are fairly cheap, compared to other companies.    From the customer service side of it, Insignia's do horribly.  If your Insignia breaks down, it will be weeks or even months before it is repaired.  Insignia's warranty is also very limited - it doesn't even include LCD screens, which are the most likely part to fail on the entire TV.  Some of the repair technicians I work with say that there are human finger prints on the inside of the screens, resulting in a blurry picture.  But even though the manufacturer is obviously at fault, Insignia refuses to remedy this problem under the warranty.

Fixed lenses are those that cannot be focused ... they are pre-focused and you don't want those.<br>  <br>  For landscapes, look for a nice 20 mm ... they are just about the best for landscape and architecture shots.

6Hx5ZFK1aa	Hey,my girlfriend has just downloaded Nidesoft audio converter.It could convert audio files between many music formats, including MP3, WMA, M4A, AAC, AC3, MP2, WAV, OGG.<br>  The Nidesoft audio converter is from:<br>  <a href="http://www.nidesoft.com/audio-converter.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nidesoft.com/audio-converter....</a>|`|brQ8fZ8gaa	Yes, you can.

fGRuRzrlaa	the "dice" is saying that the iPod touch cannot play that type of file. usually a flash video, as previously stated.<br>  <br>  to play a video from the internet, it has to be in a quicktime format...you might be able to do a google search for some good websites (youtube is mostly quicktime, but not only)|`|PDLSQj2qaa	You can't do anything about it.

6LxFcTgbaa	Basically what the first person said. Open up iTunes and insert the CD that you want on your iPod. Wait for the computer/laptop to read the disk.  After that, a certain page will come up on iTunes, and sometimes a window will pop up asking you if you would like to import the songs into your iPod. Select yes, and it will start loading your songs. After every song has a green check mark beside it, plug in your iPod and let it sync. And there you go!    Hope I helped! xox|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	You need to sync the cd into itunes ans once it finishes syncing then you can just drag the music onto the ipod
cUpwcxjraa	::: LG Dare :::<br>  <br>  Pros ~ The LG Dare has an intuitive touch-screen interface, an advanced 3.2-megapixel camera, a full HTML browser, EV-DO Rev. A, and plenty of other powerful features. It also has excellent call quality.<br>  <br>  Cons ~ The LG Dare's touch interface has a slight learning curve, and the handwriting interface sucks. Also, the Web browsing experience was quite disappointing.<br>  <br>  Bottomline ~ The LG Dare is an innovative and feature-rich handset with several surprises that sets it apart from other touch-screen phones.|`|LzSj90pbaa	my opinion:<br>  It has a touchscreen, and touchscreens suck.<br>  It has a very weak camera with cheap optics.<br>  It is not a smartphone, so you cannot install apps on it.<br>  It doesnt have wifi.<br>  its not a phone id even consider.

I91lFgTdaa	Yes a Stereo Amp is the best way to go for just Front Speaker.<br>  <br>  The best way is the match the Power Handling.<br>  <br>  My recommendation is to get Onkyo, Sony, Yamaha and some close to those will be good for you speakers.<br>  <br>  These amps that I have recommended cost range from $120 to $240 Depending on which one you get.<br>  <br>  Also don't forget the cables they also affect the sound too.<br>  <br>  Monster Cable are the best to go with.|`|0NVypgGSaa	go to emotiva.com|`|r8HAHhgkaa	it really doesn't matter which one you buy,. i mean there are lots that would work for that.

No static, no issues with texting, etc.|`|PXBm6jovaa	ive never had staticky problems but<br>  sometimes when i send a text or pic message, the picture of the envelope keeps going and going into the mailbox, for minutes, it wont end and send the damn text! then the phone wont respond to any of the buttons, very aggravating.
bRJAqc8Baa	Ok.  Lets start eliminating a few things.  We know it is not the DVD player since it is the third one.  We know it is not the television since you can watch a tape.  (Still watching tapes huh?  Just kidding.)  We know it is not the input on the television because the tape player is plugged in there, because the DVD is rerouted through it.  And we know it is not the cables.  We also know it is only certain DVD's, not all, and certain ones play fine the first time, not the second.<br>  <br>  So I believe the problem is with the DVD's themselves.  Are these "bootleg" DVD's bought from the guy at work whose son gets them from his third's cousin's, best friend's girlfriend's sister?  Just kidding again.<br>  <br>  Well that is a tough one.  My only, somewhat educated guess is the type of DVD's you are playing.
oFtwiquCaa	I am not 100% but I think bluetooth is about<br>  <br>  721 Kb/s and if you have 4.6GB it is going to take some time<br>  <br>  <br>  721 Kb/s = 0.0006875992 GB|`|I91lFgTdaa	Most likely from what I have experence it is soppose to take this long because you are loading 4.6 GB at one time. It will not get any longer because next time you are only syncing a couple songs not another 4.6 GB. It taks me around 8 Minutes to download 205 songs from Itunes to my Ipod and that is one time.
u3yA68pdaa	make sure you've chosen the option "sync only checked songs".|`|Vio61gj2aa	the check marks are just to chexk of the songs you wantto play on shuffle .. if you dont want the other songs on your ipod delete them or make a playlist and just put the ones you want on there and listen to that listt thata what i do .|`|E3sBH4kuaa	plug in you iPod to the computer, then re-sync the entire library so that it recognizes the songs u dont want to add.|`|hpEtO45vaa	If they are already on your iPod you've got to delete it off there and by uncheking when you sync your music they won't be coppied but it won't delete the songs.|`|90faa4cd94ef7f4fc6117ba415c52a62aa	gud , u found it .
UtHnh0aHaa	The marketplace is very vertical for this type of hardware right now. Many of the 'off brand' items are very poor quality because of poor voltage regulator circuits.<br>  <br>  I would try to stick with brand names but source one from someone that is upgrading to on with more voices or functions. Most of the quality units now have upgradable firmware making them more scarce right now. I'm sure you have done some research. Don't be afraid to investigate offshore quality brands such as Gem, Yamaha DG or American Audio professional.<br>  <br>  Some of the analog combination processors including phasers are an add on worth checking because they are so cheap.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|242b5d3463143055c75676eb351f96e2aa	This Wikipedia article has a list of 808 clones that might be worth looking into:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-808" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-808</a>
XcF4L6KMaa	My wife has a voyager, and it wont do half the things my Berry will do. The curve will run 3rd party apps, it has a better web experience, and is more reliable. But you gotta decide whether the 30 extra dollars a month is worth it or not. If internet and email isnt your thing, then stick with the phone you have if you like it. You actually have both phones right there, so sit down with her, and mess around for awhile. I do know the calendar is way better on the Berry, and alot easier to imput appointments. Also there is no comparison with email. But again play with your wifes for awhile, and then decide whether its cost effective to switch. If you have unlimited text and pics, then your bill wont go up too awfull much once you drop all that stuff off your Voyager, and add the second blackberry data package.
fVimGtmpaa	i honestly hate the voyager because the touch screen eventually screws up. one time the phone accidentally called one of my friends and everything that me and my friends were saying was being listened to! it was sooo bad! get the blackberry!|`|602eb8b9f3eeb9a4df562245f12b7f11aa	If you don't actually need the PDA functions I would stick with the voyager.

i7ZArzliaa	I'd take a look on Craigslist... you can find some really good deals on just about anything there.  I picked up a "Slim" PS2 on there for less than $60US for my brother last year.<br>  <br>  Also, as another poster had said... RROD (Red Ring of Death) is a problem with all Xbox360s (both used or brand new out of the box)... but is really case by case.  Moreover, if it's under warranty, you can have it fixed/replaced free of charge.  Or, if you can't wait (or the warranty has expired), you can fix it yourself quite easily.  My Xbox360 is North American and was happily running fine for over 3 years; but it failed on me and living in Japan, I had to fix it myself... following a few Youtube videos, it costed about $20 in new "parts" from a local computer shop and voila, no more RROD! :)<br>  <br>  Anyway~ hope this helps! Happy gaming!<br>  <br>  Offnote to all original posters: It would be much appreciated if you chose a Best Answer to your question when you feel you've gotten it... even if it is not mine... many people spend a lot of time honestly researching and answering questions for you, and sadly, most of them never even receive a simple "Thanks". A few seconds of your time to click a button is but a nice gesture.

The Samsung Blackjack II (SGH-i616) has all of the features that you are looking for.<br>  <br>  It has an Outlook synchronizer that will synchronize your calendar, reminders, tasks, notes and contacts. My reminders show on my main screen and can be set to remind me at any interval (just like Outlook). It can be synchronized with my PC so I always have updated information available. It also comes with Microsoft Office Viewers which can come in handy if someone e-mails attachments.<br>  <br>  It also has the features that you are less interested in (It comes with Windows Media Mobile 10 and a 2 megapixel camera).<br>  <br>  Upgrading to Windows Mobile 6.1 (free from your provider's website) allows you to have threaded messages (so text messages look like a conversation) and more customization of the main screen.|`|fkpaxydPaa	A palm or a blackberry but a bb is best|`|cTVPyN5Maa	The best phone for you would be BlackBerry Storm or iPhone 3G.<br>  Both are very handy when it comes to being organized.|`|QVeVR1i8aa	check that one out and tell me what you think???
AA11686362	No but you can do it yourself like on YouTube.  good luck..
doZ6eCPYaa	I don't have an aswer, but mine does the same thing. I have had it since launch, and it has done this once before. I am guessing it is some sort of loose contact inside the phone. The speakerphone works, but not the speaker in the earpiece. I'm going to take mine back to T-Mobile as soon as I can and see if they can return it. I'll try to post back when I find out what they say.|`|4ppm2b1gaa	I have the G1 too and there is no option for just the playback sound to just come from the speaker on the back. When ur talking to someone, hit menu and there will be an option that says Speakerphone. Click it.<br>  <br>  And if you meant other sounds like music and not in-call sound then thats normal.|`|PaSJJkYHaa	It sounds defective...T-Mobile will send you a new. Just give them a call and report the problem. And or Google for a G1 forum and collaborate with other G1 owners to see if someone else had a similar problem/solution.
XbjwbzcUaa	If you purchase it directly from Alltel, then yes you do have to place that phone on a Smart Choice plan with a 2 year agreement saying that you will stay on a smart choice plan, no matter what! You can still change plans, but it can only be between the Smart Choice Plans.<br>  <br>   If you purchase it else where, than you do not. Just be warned that you will not be able to use the internet and email options on the phone if you are not on that plan. The phone will constantly remind you of that every so often as well with an annoying pop up box saying it cannot connect to the network. <br>  <br>  I'd also do a software upgrade on the phone as well to improve your battery life on that phone. The battery life is TERRIBLE without it. htc.com has the upgrade.<br>  Good luck!|`|KYHVba69aa	rawrrbit, I've had my UTStarcom PPC6700 for 4 days and my battery doesn't last too.|`|xnCizA7Daa	no you dont need a smart phone plan to get that phone

LzSj90pbaa	heres a few things.<br>  the dare is not a smartphone, so you will never get apps for it.<br>  The storm is a smartphone running a popular firmware, however, due to the fact that it is a touchscreen, no apps that will work on RIM OS will work on the storm unless its specifically programmed for it.<br>  Finally, unlike the iphone, windows mobile or symbian s60, will always have more apps available to them, because they are true smartphones. Many people do not consider the iphone a smartphone, because of the app store. These are applications approved by apple, and you cannot install third party apps on it (without hacking it). If apple doesnt approve of it, you wont get it.<br>  So my suggestion is, if you want a bigger variety of apps then the iphone has available, get a windows mobile or symbian s60 smartphone.|`|5bS5mndMaa	not at all!!  the apps are from apple and itunes, that's y they also work on the ipod touch
ZX4hUDpTaa	to QueenJ, Microsoft does have a brand of hard drive they use seagate get ur facts right and to your answer they only banned it because they modded it or upgrade the firmware to read back up games , Live doenst have to do anything with your hard drive its mostly for saveing things as compare to a modded firmware. thats why ur friend prolly had to go buy a new one becuase his was modded.  ..i have upgrade my arcade core to 120 gb with wd120bevs works just like the one xbox is selling but save alot of $$$$$|`|5q8bUCN3aa	Go with the MS brand cause you don't want to take the chance of getting a new 360
Ns6I7MmBaa	Most digital channels are UHF, so you need an antenna with good UHF reception.  I wouldn't think you should have trouble that close to stations unless your building blocks the signals and your apartment faces away from them.<br>  <br>  I am 35 miles from Chicago transmitters and get good reception for all the UHF digital channels with an indoor UHF antenna in 2nd floor window boosted by an amplifier.  But I cannot get hardly any reception on first floor.  Fortunately previous owner had cables from former cable TV that I used to connect 2nd floor antenna to 1st floor TV.<br>  <br>  I just got one of the better rated $40 coupon digital converters and has good reception for all the channels my HDTV does.  Neither one receives the only VHF digital station on channel 3.|`|Vzzc6mATaa	You need a good antenna  high on roof or wall if you want to be sure its going to work|`|mPrUYEDiaa	the rabbit ear antenna only picks up analog signals. you need an antenna with a sturdy loop. that is what picks up digital signals. <br>  <br>  preferably amplified. go to your nearest radioshack.|`|VYywucN8aa	Im using a db2 outdoor antenna hanging on my inside wall of my condo.

d1fee41232bb81bff138e747ce6187bdaa	You take a component (blue, green, red) cable or HDMI cable from the Dish-HD box to the receiver source input that will accept either of these two types of cables. These two types will carry your video and surround channels to the receiver then you just have to switch the receiver input source to whatever you plugged them into to listen to TV in surround. You also need to run an HDMI or component cable from the receiver to the TV. Hopefully your receiver has internal switching and will run all inputs through one output to the TV?<br>  <br>  The TV broadcast needs to be in dolby 5.1 broadcast for the surround to work as well. <br>  <br>  Do not use a pair of red and white cables. They only transmit left and right stereo channels not surround sound.|`|AA12133586	hook up your satellite to your receiver|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Run an HDMI cable from your Dish to the receiver.  Then run another HDMI (or component video cables) from your receiver to your TV.  That will take care of the audio.  If you can send the video separately to the TV you should do so.|`|I91lFgTdaa	You can use the Audio Ouptut on you TV it is either Red & White or Optical, or if the Dish Box has audio outputs you can plug the cable into the Home Theater which can either have Red & White, Optical, Coxical or HDMI.<br>  <br>  The Kinds of cables you can use are regular AV cables, Coxical, Optical and HDMI which supports Best Audio and Video.<br>  <br>  Red & White one are the most basic<br>  <br>  Coxical requires one calbe and has a Orange or Black Port.<br>  <br>  Optical is best just for audio and requires one cable. The output port should have a red laser shinning do not looking or stare into it.<br>  <br>  And HDMI shold be flat and only requires one cable.|`|bRJAqc8Baa	DO NOT USE THE AUDIO OUTPUT ON YOUR T.V.!<br>  <br>  As a professional technician I wish, as do other professional techs, that manufacturers would stop making audio outs on televisions.<br>  <br>  A television is just a receiver.  It receivers video and audio from a source.  It does not produce sound, so the audio out is just a terrible feature put on some televisions.<br>  <br>  You want to take the source of the audtio (your HDTV box) and take audio cords (red and white plugs on the end) and plug them into the audio out on the HDTV box.  Now plug them into the SAT/CABLE audio in on your receiver.  If you do not have that then plug them into the AUX/AUDIO IN function on the receiver.  <br>  <br>  You will then need to select the same function on the receiver to hear the incoming sound.  Meaning if you put the cords in AUX select that on your receiver.  If you do not see that selection on the front then hit the source button until it toggles to it.<br>  <br>  Sorry about the direct response in the beginning, but I saw someone told you to use the audio out on the television.  It drives techs crazy to see the audio rerouted for no reason.  You will lose a ton of sound quality that way.
tjg7hLbMaa	Depending on the amount you use your phone, you may be able to see that far back.<br>  <br>  You need to look in your menu for something called "Call History". That will give you a history of calls you've made and received. When I hit the call button on my phone (without putting in any numbers) the call history automatically comes up.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can wait for your bill to arrive (if you have detailed billing) to look at the information. Since it was an incoming call you won't see the phone number on your invoice but you can see the length/time of the call. If you don't get detailed billing, the company should be able to provide you with the date/time/length of the call if you give them a ring! Even if it's prepaid, they may be able to provide you with that information.|`|a2f975873846ee8ced72fab76fde0c44aa	It depends on just how much history your phone can store. Therefore, the answer to your question is yes.|`|hnxknAUcaa	I my ohoen I go to call history and I can see every person I called and called me all the way back to when I got the cell phone.|`|602eb8b9f3eeb9a4df562245f12b7f11aa	Most phones will only hold approximately 60 incoming and 60 outgoing.  Go into your menu, then recent calls, then incoming or received.  If if was a missed call look there instead.  If you have had too many of that type of call since then, then the only other place would be to watch for it on your bill.  If you don't get an itemized bill then don't worry.  Most cell companies will print one for you for the month you want and mail it to you.  They may charge for it but they will do it if you call and ask.|`|B2UuTy2Yaa	I would imagine. I mean it might depend on what kind of phone you have.

dVK7E5Kiaa	Hi, I suggest you use online faxing solutions. They are a GREEN choice because you don't waste paper and not to mention the headaches of paper jams, ink and paper expenses you have to bear with fax machines.    With online faxing you DON't need a fax machine, or complicated installation. If you have a computer with internet access then you are ready to fax and you can fax to any fax number in the world.    Also, did you know that a fax machine is the most energy consuming office machine? However, with online faxing you can send AND receive faxes 24/7 without increasing your electricity bill. Plus these services will give you a free local or toll free number among other features offered.    You should take advantage of their 30 day free trial where you can test drive their service and then see if it is what you need.    I made the switch over the online faxing last year and I've save thousands on electricity bills, paper and ink expenses. It is so much easier, if you know how to send an email then you know how to fax online.    Check out the source below, pick the service you want to try and take it for a test with their 30 day free trial! Hope this information helps!|`|SYF0VHDPaa	The fax machine may have a problem with its modem.  Consult the manufacturer for assistance.  As long as you're connecting the wall jack to the "line" jack on the fax machine, your fax machine should not affect the line as you described.

ElvQTpUVaa	Frostwire?  That's the 1st mistake.    Second - sounds like you've downloaded a file - are you sure it's a complete download.  Please be specific about what the program indicates (we both know it didn't "say" anything).  Also please indicate which OS.  On Vista, you may have folders with hidden files - you'll need to play with the folder settings to find these out.    Since you're downloading using a peer-share program, I've included the following message regarding free downloads of files:    You have some options.    You can buy the music online at legit sites like iTunes.  If you dont have an iPod, you can use any number of free programs to convert the mp4 to mp3.  The problem is that much of the stuff on pay sites is covered by DRM that limits what you can do with it.    You can rip music from CDs  helpful if your local library is stocked, or you have friends that share your tastes but are okay with paying for them.    You can stream music from an internet radio station through your PC, then use a program like Audacity to record that stream as an MP3 or wav file.  You can scan through that recorded stream looking for the songs you want, then copy that part of the stream containing the desired song to an excerpted copy of the larger stream  (audacity handles this as well).    If you must use peer-share, you run the risk of infecting your pc by 1) downloading the client program, because it may have viruses; 2) visiting the webpage that hosts the program, because it may contain malware of its own & 3) downloading the media which (in peer-share) comes from other users.  No Peer-Share system can guarantee the safety or quality of its media.    Id avoid Limewire and its variants.  I tried limewire a few weeks back after years of happy reliance on winmx and emule.  It was nothing special  downloads werent fast, selection wasnt great.

You will certainly enjoy that class and learn a lot about photography that will help you no matter what medium you end up working in (hopefully a little of both).  What they are wanting you to get is most definitely an SLR camera.  The classic learning camera is the Pentax K1000.  It was replaced in the mid nineties with the Pentax ZX-M.  Many will still recommend that you pick up a K1000.  They are great cameras no doubt but the ZX-M should still be serviceable and is newer.  I think especially while you are learning the newer the camera you can get the better.  Mainly because if something goes wrong you it will be more rare and you most likely won't know what to do about it so it will need to be something that is serviceable either by the manufacturer or by camera repairmen.  The good news is 35mm film cameras are nearly indestructible.  They don't have the 100,000 snap limits like DSLR's do so if you are comfortable with the idea get an older one like the K1000.  Just make sure it has good light seals.  I would definitely recommend Pentax but that is mostly because they were classic learning cameras and because the lenses can be purchased for much less money.  <br>  <br>  As to your poll question hard to decide I think I like Nikon optics better but I like Canon cameras better.  Toss up.  The reason those are the two most popular isn't because they are the two most superior.  It is because they had good marketing and became the definitive press cameras of the 35mm and subsequent digital age.  They maintained that by releasing ridiculously specific lenses which are nice but unnecessary.  Pentax was slow in diving into digital which is the main reason they don't get much recognition now.  When you are pretty much the king of film cameras why would you want to get into the rat race of developing digital sensors and what not.  However, now that they are in and have partnered with Samsung to create the digital cameras from the ground up they are moving up the digital ladder.  So go Pentax and you won't be disappointed when or if you decide to make the lemming-like plunge into digital photography.
9eR6pNpRaa	Sounds like there is a disfunction with it. I would try a software that downloads to the computer so they you can have music that like, or videos.
pZGLhV2Waa	As a general rule flashes like lenses are not interchangeable. Older flashes from other brands probably wont work at all. If they do you may have a bigger problem. The various brands of cameras use  different trigger voltages. If you put the wrong flash on your camera you run the risk of frying the electronics in your camera. I would save up the extra money to get the Olympus flash but there are third party flash makers. Just make sure it is designed to work with your Olympus.|`|440b5eeaa808017d23fb3beb1ec4fa73aa	I was told by a sales person at a reputable store that there is a voltage difference between the older SLRs and the DSLRs along with the external flash units, and using a flash unit that is not compatible with DSLRs will fry the DSLR.<br>  <br>  I have no idea how true the statement might be, but considering the cost of the DSLRs and how inexpensive a external flash unit cost it is better to be safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|AA11096257	Go online and see if there are external flash for your camera, you to used flash made for you camera itself or it brand of camera. There might be third party flashes, but they are flakey. Go to Olympus website, B&H photo.com, or Amazon to look and compare prices. hope this helps.|`|xcw4EBalaa	no|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  Some cameras like Sony, Minolta and Konica Minolta cameras have a proprietary shoe design.<br>  <br>  You will have to check and see if the old flash units can actually be used.  The major problem is this.  Most digital cameras cannot use flash units with trigger voltages higher than 6 v on Canon, 12 v on Nikon.  You will have to 1) check with Olympus to see that the recommended threshold trigger voltage is and then make sure your old units have trigger voltages at or less than the Olympus recommended voltages

6KlNjzbxaa	i had this problem the first time i went on the playstation store, until i saw demo under some games.<br>  i was such a dumbass lol!!!!|`|1c0f793db881cd47badc0d00bd5bd1caaa	You must be because there are demos for res evil 5, fifa, pro evo, gran turismo 5 prologue, dirt,  mirrors edge, killzone 2, fear 2, dead space, burnout, and others, not to mention all the psp demo's vids and wallpapers.   Just check out the latest sectiion or A-Z of games, the demo's say "Demo's" which are free to download and the full games you have to pay for say, ￡x.xx go to checkout most are 2 or 3 levels and give you a good idea if you are going to like the full game. Honestly I don't know what you are doing because they ain't hard to find!|`|QIlhmWwBaa	yes to the left there should be this thing that says demos|`|Xxviy63Paa	Yes, you're looking in the wrong place. In the US store, there is a separate link on the left for "demos" that you need to hit. In the European store, the demos are lumped in with the regular-priced games and you just have to browse through and find them. In the Japan store, I don't know, never been to that one.<br>  <br>  I haven't seen the new US demos cause I'm still downloading Killzone2 demo from Europe. But there's a zillion, here are a few:<br>  <br>  motor storm<br>  motor storm pacific rift<br>  condemned 2 bloodshot<br>  fear 2<br>  ghost recon advanced warfighter 2<br>  Turok<br>  Kane and Lynch<br>  The club<br>  hot shots golf<br>  super rocket powered acrobatic battle cars<br>  metal gear solid 4<br>  metal gear solid 4 online (separate)<br>  mirror's edge<br>  warhawk<br>  nhl 09<br>  nhl 2k9<br>  various football stuff<br>  F1 championship edition<br>  Grid<br>  Dirt<br>  ATV vs MX unchained, or something<br>  Wipeout HD<br>  Resident Evil 5 (crap)<br>  Ridge Racer 7<br>  Folklore<br>  Valkyria Chronicles<br>  <br>  That is maybe about 1/10th of them.<br>  <br>  In the euro store, you can get Killzone 2 and PES 09. In the US store you can get resident evil 5 which is garbage.|`|mPaqhgUuaa	Of course there's demos that you can try out! Just go to the playstation store and check out their demo section.|`|pOi0wewIaa	Yes<br>  <br>  Just go to the Demo section and you'll find all the demos that are available.|`|k6CSa9caaa	well ive just downloaded a load so youre looking in wrong place.

You can also just hold the marker or the link over a game and see if it says "free". cause the  you know that its free. but if there is a prize for it then it isn't free. If nothing of this helps then try calling or emailing Sony or Sony Playstation. If you wanna call them, then try searching for the hot-line number via google. But it costs to call them. try emailing them. Hope all this information helped.|`|uKrRyVgVaa	They usually have demos, I for example played motor storm:pacific rift, Dead Space, Mirrors Edge all demos. Also sometimes when pre-order you'll get a code that will let you try the game out but i suppose that's quite unfair.<br>  Its hard to find but it would say "Playable demo" in description|`|tLyG8fx1aa	Go on the Playstation Store and scroll down to the option that should say Demos.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	The 2 relays are similar.  But the one you say you need operates at 5 volts DC and the coil will draw 100 mA at that voltage.  This is the voltage you apply to the coil to operate it and make the contacts change.  The contacts of this relay are rated at 2 amps of current at 30 volts DC or 1 amp of current at 125 volts AC.    <br>  The Radio Shack one is a 12 volt DC relay and needs 12 volts applied to the coil to make it operate.  The specs tab doesn't include much, but the 10A means the contacts can handle up to 10 amps of current.  It doesn't give a voltage rating for the contacts, but it does say  "ideal for switching high-current appliances and lighting."  I would take this to mean it can handle 125 volts at 10 amps.  <br>  The critical thing is the coil voltage.  The 12 volt relay won't operate from the 5 volt circuit of the other relay.  You can find the relay you need at either of the sources below.  Make sure the physical size, shape, and lead placement are the same to solder in place correctly.  Just do a search through their on-line catalog.  I've dealt with both outfits and they're both good places.|`|becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	The one you need seems to be able to handle both AC and DC.<br>  The one you have is DC only.<br>  <br>  Check the power you are going to use it (5 V, 12V, 24 v , etc.)<br>  Check the amps you plan to draw<br>  <br>  If what you have can handle the amps at the specific Voltage, you are OK.

PE1jfm6caa	Blu-ray Discs may be encoded with a region code, intended to restrict the area of the world in which they can be played, similar in principle to the DVD region codes, although the used geographical regions differ. Blu-ray Disc players sold in a certain region may only play discs encoded for that region. This is primarily used for market segmentation, or price discrimination, but it also allows motion picture studios to control the various aspects of a release (including content and release date) according to the region. Discs may also be produced without region coding, so they can be played on all devices. The countries of the major Blu-ray manufacturers (Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, etc.) are in the same region as the Americas. As of late 2008, almost 70% of all released discs were region-free.<br>  <br>  Major studios have different region coding policies. Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios have released all of their titles region free. Sony Pictures and Warner Bros. have released most of their titles region free, but titles released by Warner's New Line division were, initially, region-coded but subsequently have been released without being locked. Titles released by other labels on behalf of New Line are still subject to some region locking. Lionsgate and Walt Disney Pictures have released a mix of titles that were region free and region coded. 20th Century Fox has released all but three of their titles region coded.<br>  <br>  In the Blu-ray region coding system, the United States is placed in region A while regions B and C are used for countries which can experience localization delays before U.S. titles are officially released. The opposite, though, is sometimes true and a few new titles such as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Running Scared were released in certain European countries before the U.S. release. In response to the DVD region system, multi-region and region-free DVD players became dominant in certain markets; certain Blu-ray player models have been modified to allow for playback of Blu-ray and DVD discs with any region code.|`|Xxviy63Paa	if the disc really is multi-regional, yes. There are only 3 blu-ray regions unlike dvd regions where there's something like 8 or 9 at least.<br>  <br>  The blu-ray region America is in includes the entire continents of North and South America, and almost the entire Pacific Ocean including the Philippines and, I think, Japan. Don't know about the rest. But if it says multiregional, it's got to be at least 3, because only 2 would be bi-regional.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Only if the actual disc is multiregional

Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours sifting through thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)<br>  <br>  2) Preview before you play<br>  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well. <br>  <br>  3) Virus Risks<br>  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for. <br>  <br>  4) Settings<br>  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:<br>  - Install<br>  - Select the folder<br>  - Select the quality<br>  - Download your songs<br>  <br>  5) Wider Variety of Music<br>  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can. <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:<br>  <br>  Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:<br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.<br>  <br>  2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading<br>  <br>  3) No viruses.<br>  <br>  4) Preview before you play<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  n/a<br>  <br>  <br>  Limewire:<br>  Pros:<br>  - You can download free music<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  - Everything else<br>  <br>  Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com|`|DhixaEAcaa	download "FREE Hi-Q Recorder".
