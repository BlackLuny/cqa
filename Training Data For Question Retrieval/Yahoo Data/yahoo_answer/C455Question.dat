That means that we don't know for sure how long we will be living here or how long he will be unemployed. Or if he does get a job quickly if we want to look into buying a home in a year or so from now.  I found a different place to rent which is comparable in price and is better suited for our needs. Is the stress and financial cost of moving worth it, or do we just wait it out where we are for a few more months and see where we end up?

The carport's flooring is about five inches below the flooring of the main house.  The carport's flooring looks solid with no cracks.  Can we add more concrete over the existing carport flooring to make it even with the house?  If so, are there any things we should consider?

20090226152236AAhLqX7	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	I clean my room, and now its messy!?	Ok, so i have a little problem. Every time i clean my room somewhere in the next two days it becomes dirtier and dirtier. My main problem is clothes, when i do a load of laundry i usually leave the clothes in the hamper/basket and never get around to folding them. So from there i change and throw dirty and clean clothes on the floor. 90% of my floor is covered in clothes! I just hate folding them. I have many other problems but thats the main one, how can i prevent problem 1 and also clean my room and KEEP it that way for along time. I usually dread going into my room because i end up falling or having to climb over many things to get to my dresser (which is also cluttered)      HELP, 10 points

20090226152631AA0cWVh	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Am I having a problem with my hot water heater?	I think I am having a problem with my hot water heater.  I used to be able to take hot showers for almost a hour if I wanted to and had no issues with having plenty of steamy hot water.  Now the water appears not to be quite as hot and and runs out after about 10-15 minutes of shower time.  After that, the entire house has no water, and I have to wait with the water completely off for 5 minutes before it gets warm again.  Are there any plumbers or home owners who have run into this issue?  Do I need a new hot water heater or is it some other plumbing problem?  The unit itself is an electric heater, and the thermostat is inside under a panel, so I doubt it was tampered with.  Thanks so much for your assistance with this, it is much appreciated! :)

20090226152139AA0NXDE	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	What do you keep in your refrigerator door tip-open compartments?	I just bought a refrigerator. One door has a "Fresh-n-Ready" tip open bin on the inside of the door, with three separate columns.  I have no idea what to put in this drawer.  At the store I think the sample had cut up celery and carrots, the idea being that you could store "ready to go" snacks in these compartments.  But honestly, I like to store my celery in a container filled with water.  I could stick carrots in there, I suppose, but I'm wondering: if your refrigerator is similar, what do you store there?        Right now I'm thinking I would have preferred a plain old shelf that I could use for salad dressings, condiments, etc.  But there must be something brilliant I can stick in there that I'm not thinking of.  Ideas?
