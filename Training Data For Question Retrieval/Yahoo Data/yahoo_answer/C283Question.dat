The only reason it won was because it was such a weak year in the best picture category.

My husband is convinced that the girl that appears at the end of the commercials (on the phone) is the original AAMI girl and would like to see what she looks like now.      A few people are in dispute with him that this is a new girl but he wants hard solid proof before he will accept it.  I've read on the net that AAMI did look for a similar looking girl and I think this is her...       http://www.aami.com.au/company-informati...        but this new girl on the above website is definitely not the girl my husband sees at the end of the ads now (and I agree with him).      The girl in the jewellery store stalking Todd has nothing to do with this girl by the way - he would be offended that anybody would even mention her.       So please, can anyone give me any solid proof that the girl at the end of the ads is in fact the original AAMI girl and better still, a photo of what she looks like now!  I have searched far and wide on the net but without success.

Violino is supposed to be warmer, but if anyone has tried Obligato AND Violino, please offer your advice on which you think is better.       And I'm not sure about the Tonica. Apparently they released a new line... I have the old edition, haven't tried it, don't really want to open it yet until I decide to actually use it or not.

20090223034827AAYTBno	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Is this joke worth reading..Husband and wife are traveling by car .?	After almost twenty-four hours on the road, being too tired to continue,      they decide to stop for a rest.      They stop at a hotel and take a room, but they only plan to sleep      for four hours, shower and then get back on the road.      When they check out four hours later, the desk clerk hands them a bill      for $350.00.      The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high.      He tells the clerk although it's a nice hotel, the rooms certainly      aren't worth $350.00!      When the clerk tells him $350.00 is the standard rate, the man insists      on speaking to the Manager.      The Manager appears, listens to the man, and then explains that the      hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center that were      available for the husband and wife to use.      But we didn't use them,' the man complains.      'Well, they are here, and you could have,'      explains the Manager.      He goes on to explain they could have      taken in one of the shows for which the hotel is famous.      'The best entertainers from New York, Hollywood and Las Vegas perform      here.' the Manager says.      'But we didn't go to any of those shows,' complains the man again.      'Well, we have them, and you could have,' the Manager replies.      No matter what amenity the Manager mentions, the man replies, 'But we      didn't use it!'      The Manager is unmoved, and eventually the man gives up and agrees to      pay. He writes a check and gives it to the Manager.      The Manager is surprised when he looks at the check.      'But sir,' he says, this check is only made out for $50.00.'      'That's correct,' says the man. 'I charged you $300.00 for sleeping with      my wife.'

Ok, I have my lip pierced (on the side, didn't really feel it) and my belly button (pinched a little, but not much pain). I've wanted a tattoo forever, but I've also wanted my tongue pierced for like 10 years. I can't decide which to get first. I'm getting both done soon. I want, on the back of my neck, the open heart symbol with the top half blue (light) and the bottom half pink (light) and a small Pisces symbol on the left beside it and a Libra symbol on the right. I'm getting that because my husband is a Pisces and my daughter and I are Libras. I handle pain really well (65+ hours of labor, no pain meds, used to be a cutter, broken tons of bones and laughed, etc.). Which do you think I should get first?    Tongue piercing, or   Tattoo

20090222182032AAxeO3U	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Gay marriage topic at the Oscars?	While I believe in equal rights for all including those that "choose" to be gay, I do not need to hear about how "gay marriage" will be eventually backed by our country in the coming years while I'm watching the A.Awards show. Gays DO NOT have the right to Marry based on what scripture says. Our country was founded and based on biblical principles and that should never change and it has nothing to do with our freedoms. Just because we live in a country that values freedom, that doesn't give people the right to kill, marry multiple partners, rape random people, marry your pets, steal,......you get the point. And that also goes for gay marriage backed by our churches. And please stop comparing gay rights to those that were "oppressed" in our country back in the 40's 50's and 60's. Blacks had it ten times worse than gays and what they went through was truly unfair. So leave the gay rights talk out of the Oscars.....

Does anyone else feel the same way?

20090223024411AAvRYWS	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Repost but Do you like this...It was Postman Pat's last day on the job?	after 35 years of carrying the mail through all kinds of weather to the same villages and towns.   When he arrived at the first house on his route, he was greeted by the whole family there, who all hugged and congratulated him and sent him on his way with a gift cheque for ￡50.   At the second house they presented him an 18-carat goldwatch.   The folks at the third house handed him a bottle of 15-year old Scotch whisky.   At the fourth house he was met at the door by a blonde in her lingerie. She took him by the arm and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love-making he had ever experienced.   When he had had enough they went downstairs, where the blonde fixed him a full English breakfast: Bacon, Eggs, Sausage & Tomato with freshly squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a ￡5 note sticking out from under the cups bottom edge.   'All this was just too wonderful for words,' he said, 'but what's the five quid for?' 'Well,' said the dumb blonde, 'last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day and that we should do something special for you'. 'I asked him what to give you'.   He said, 'F*ck him. Give him a fiver.' She smiled shyly and said, 'The breakfast was my idea.'

But I went on her facebook the other day, and there's a lot of stuff suggesting that she's lesbian, but I'm not sure.       There's a lot of pictures of her with this one girl, and in a couple of them they are kissing. In one, the kiss is on the lips. Also, the girl she's with a lot (maybe her gf, if she is lesbian) has a picture up of her dancing with some random other girl, and the description is "the night (name here) became lesbian". There are also some wall posts where her possible gf refers to her as lover.      What are the chances that she's really lesbian, and if she is, is there a chance that she's just bi? She seems perfect for me, and I really like her already.

Is it not ridiculous to be filmed dying for money (and it doesn't matter for what reason, she already got 1 mil from her weddings contract)? My granddad died from cancer in front of me when i was a kid, honestly i wouldn't like to see it again. Where is her dignity and pride?Does she not think about her kids, who would be able to see her on that video when they grow up? I wouldn't do it to my child.This is insane. And whoever tell me that she does it for awareness will have to think twice about it. I wouldn't even know her name if media wouldn't be sticking her all over the papers. She won BB, i don't even like this programme, but it doesn't matter. Did she put any money towards charities, i doubt that. I think she has done enough to raise awareness about cancer, but filming her dying is discrace.

20090222234207AA1Bub2	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you still like Harry Potter?	i will never stop loving harry potter :)   the books are so magical and well-written.   the characters are so amazing and memorable.   i read the books when my family was going through a hard time, and they made everything slip away and it was like i dove into this world of magic and left all the bad stuff behind.    JKR is a truly amazing author :)   Every book is magical.   When I was reading Twilight on the other hand...   first off, i loved the movie. and i was in love with Edward Cullen for a while. but after the first book...everything just stopped being so amazing. i got bored of the series after book #1.   But with Harry Potter, every book just gets better and more interesting.   As for the movies, i think they were pretty good up untill the 5th. I think the 4th movie was the peak, and everything is downhill from here. its that fricken David Yates. he is a horrible director.    sorry about my little rant there.    so what are your thoughts?

20090223015417AAIYBwb	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Video-game realism:pushing the envelope too far?	Video-games started off as simple pass-time fun more then 30 years ago, and its incline of evolution did not stop so far.    And nowadays,especially the last couple of years, it became obvious that video-games tend to immitate reality,less or more succesfully. Putting aside the imperfections of A.I. , a few successes like GTA 4, Crysis, Far Cry 2,Mirrors Edge really push the limit in therms of graphycs and detail. And the evolution of games keeps getting better and faster, being a very competitive industry now.    What could we expect in the future? Will there be a downfall of this fast evolution,or , in a few decades,will it even be more popular then the movie industry?    Whats your oppinion?

I went to rottentomatoes.com, and I found out that Back to the Future has a higher score than The Dark Knight(which I consider to be a quality movie).      I don't see why. I've seen the movie on TV a few times, and it seems to be nothing more than a simple mindless entertainment flick about a teenager who goes on a random suspenseful adventure.   So what makes Back to the Future a quality movie?   Quality movies are supposed to be the kind of movies that have strong stories with deep morals. Does Back to the Future have any of these things? I would appreciate some insight. That way, maybe I'll pay closer attention when I see the movie again.         ...

20090223050048AARDQ2Y	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Is Hollywood over-doing the worship of Heath Ledger?	Heath Ledger is the Australian-born actor who played the part of "The Joker" in the latest Batman 2008 movie installment, "The Dark Knight".  He died in a "toxic combination of prescription drugs" (source:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath_Ledge...  last January 2008, so there was significant talk about him at last year's Academy Awards in February 2008 although "The Dark Knight" was not brought up yet for award nominations.      Last night was the 2009 Academy Awards and Heath Ledger was honored when he won for Best Supporting Male Actor.  There was also a special presentation on stage with his family and others saying eulogistic words for him, similar to some of what we heard at the 2008 Academy Awards when they took time out to say words of sorrow for Keith Ledger.      And then, there was all the hype the past few weeks leading up to this year's Academy Awards and virtually across the board, all the Hollywood pundits and reporters were saying Heath Ledger was a shoe-in for the Best Supporting Actor award.   "Heath Ledger!  Heath Ledger!  Heath Ledger!"...was all that seemed to be coming from the TV the last several days whenever the news channels turned attention to the Academy Awards.      Now I am always one to show respect when someone has done a good job, and particularly when someone of merit has passed away.  But I do note that other memorable actors and actresses have died in the world yet I cannot recall when there was more fuss made about an actor passing (save that of Ronald Reagan) than there was with Heath Ledger.       Why?  Was he "the GREATEST actor of all time?"      [Actually, I like Jack Nicholson's portrayal of The Joker better than Heath Ledger's...and Heath also played Ennis Del Mar in "Brokeback Mountain" which I didn't care for as a Western.]      My theory is that some people are drama junkies and getting behind a worthwhile cause -- be it to raise money for AIDS or to eulogize a fallen co-worker -- can sometimes motivate sympathetic hearts to an extreme.  Hollywood is a cut-throat place where some would sell their own mother for a nickle if it got them some significant screen time, but they are also notorious as bleeding-heart liberals.  So when there is a cause to show sympathy for something, they can go ALL OUT!  (maybe to purge their own partying, guilt-ridden and tortured souls...smiles!)      Is it just my perception that the passing of Heath Ledger has been hyped to such an extreme that it may put other worthwhile actors' and actresses' passing to the pale?        No disrespect to the Ledger family intended.  I'm just wondering if Hollywood is a little out-of-balance here with what the rest of the viewing public is shown and perceives.  Was Ledger truly the GREATEST actor of all time?  And if so, did I miss something?

20090222232807AAA9mHA	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Have you ever had an "epic fail" moment?	You've seen all those "fail" pictures of ironically placed signs (and sometimes mistranslated signs), cars crashing into things, people falling off bikes, and sinking boats full of cargo crates (a.k.a the "failboats").        Have you or someone you know did something that needed a FAIL (or EPIC FAIL) tag?  Maybe you're looking frantically for your purse when it's safely situated over your shoulder.  Perhaps you saw your friend back out of the driveway while knocking over a line of trash bins.      My example is not me but my mom.  A couple of weeks ago, she locked herself out of the car with the engine running.  Today, she lost her set of keys and didn't have her spare set and I had to come and rescue her with my spare keys.  This definitely needs an EPIC FAIL tag (poor Mom was frustrated and got irritated when I brought up the first incident to her).

It's about the the appeal of Hip-hop to young white men,   1) It is a way to rebel against their parents and white society in general.   2) White males are drwan to it because it gives them a model for establishing their masculinity, as a way of asserting their manhood by associating themselves with an overtly masculine culture.      **Also, consider the fact that white males often begin listening to music around the age of 12 or 13 (when they are bginning to establish their "masculine identities"  and in contrast, most African American males report listening to rap music from a very young age.      What are your thoughts on this??

(my fingers are really soft btw)   and i've just changed a new teacher. she's very unlike my former teacher, whom i loved so very much. well, for instance, when she teaches me a new song, she doesn't play it for you once to help you get a picture of how it sounds like. for some songs it's ok, but for some others, like somthing from 21st century it's really hard for me to play. to imagine. i've only started for a week (her lessons i mean) and i'm already frustrated.   how can i like my teacher more? the only reason i promised myself to continue was only because i told myself, that i would play every song, whether i like it or not, seriously and to play it as well as i ever could.   and, i've already been playing the grade six pieces for a long time now, and the time, the year for the pieces is for 2007 to 2008. and it's over now. i just want to learn the pieces, not planning on taking exams. well, can i, like, ask her to let me try the grade seven pieces? i've already played most from the grade six', and i thought i can try the grade seven's. how can i ask her. like how can i start?      thanks, to EVERYBODY who answers. i'm really serious in asking this question i hope you guys answer just as seriously.

As for me, yes they show professional talent and look unblemished, but they are chasing more than  "at ta boys" and a pat on the back or the head if they are dogs. They are accomplished actors but still    can not veil their envy and disappointment or pettiness. They need to learn to do their job well and rewards will come from that satisfaction and not flattery with ulterior motives. Sure they will benefit from the nomination alone,  let alone the prize, but if it was given in the name of politics the halfway intelligent public will know and the benefits will be short lived.

20090223073517AATghGR	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Murder Mystery - Who killed Mr. Chaucer?	Mr. Chaucer, the frail American millionaire, was strangled to death at his home while watching his morning TV shows in his den. No evidence was found except the nylon rope around his neck. The chauffer, butler, maid, gardener, and cook were the only other people on the premises during the time of the murder.      At 8AM, the following Tuesday all 5 were gathered at the Police Station. The detective asked each one this question: "Where were you two days ago when Mr. Chaucer was murdered??   These are their statements.      CHAUFFER: I was on the back carport, giving Mr. Chaucer's new Cadillac a good wash. He always like it sparkling clean, inside and out! It was a nice day, and the forecast indicated "clear and sunny", so I took good advantage of it.      BUTLER: My good man, I was in the front drive, busy conversing with the postman. I offered him a box of the finest chocolates from Cheney's Drugstore, thanked him for his great service, and sent him on his route.      MAID: Mind you, I was tending the laundry in the utility room - pressing, hanging, and folding the clothes. It takes a bit of time, y'know, to handle each item carefully, and to make proper sure that I use the correct detergent and starch.      GARDENER: Yes, sir, I was in the garden, gathering a few things for dinner. We've had a good spell of nice weather - a little rain, a little sun - perfect for growing delicious spring veggies. Mr. Chaucer sure did love his salads! He wouldn't think of buying them at the supermarket, no sir!      COOK: I declare, I was so so so busy in my kitchen, preparing Mr. Chaucer's dinner. And I was in there alone, cuz you know I don't allow no one in my kitchen! I know where everything is, cuz everything has its place - in the fridge, the pantry, the cupboards, and the cellar where all the canned goods are!      Four told the truth, but one lied. The detective had found Mr. Chaucer's murderer. Who was it, and how did he know?

20090223054857AAQrFwP	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Advice with beginning the ABRSM piano curriculum?	I'm beginning formal piano lessons on Tuesday after being self taught for a few years. I'm not sure if my teacher knows about the ABRSM because we live in quite a small city, but she is a college student about to graduate as a piano performance major. How can I go about getting her to let me follow the ABRSM syllabus? What materials would I need?      Also, is it advisable to start at grade 1 even though I can play piano a bit? I can't read music, and I'm pretty sure I don't use the proper fingering.      Should I take the theory and piano performance grades at the same time? For instance, studying Theory grade I while doing piano grade I.      I'm hoping I can convince her to follow the syllabus and curriculum. The ABRSM offers a chance to have structure, quality, goals to shoot for, and a professional qualification. I just don't want to sound too pushy about it. Then again, I'm paying her a good bit of money.

I absolutely hate it - and there is no point to rating the songs on the CBS radio.

If it wasn't for chord diagrams and tabulature, I'd probably be lost.  My question is this:  Why does music use both sharps and flats.  I know that when I play a 6th string root A# barre chord (E shape at the 6th fret), the same notes comprise a Bb.  There must be a good (and probably simple) explanation for the use of both designations.  Thanks.

I think it might be called Half-Baked, but I'm not entirely sure.

Based on Performs alone it should have been Michael Shannon   REVOLUTIONARY ROAD or Philip Seymour Hoffman   DOUBT. Heath did good in THE DARK KNIGHT but not as good as Michael or Philip .. I mean hello he's died what does it matter to a dead person .. So what the Academy is saying is ..die and then your a shoe in ??? it should be based on pure talent. What they should have done is given it to Michael or Philip or Robert Downey Jr.   TROPIC THUNDER ..Josh Brolin MILK .. and then they should have Honored Health and what a great actor he was and all that ..   What do you all think ??

20090223052313AA8LGxx	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Do you like the Twilight Sequels?	ok so i LOVE the book Twilight BUT the 3 Sequels are absolutely terrible. Every book is worse than its predecessor. The way Bella acted with Jacob in New Moon was expectable because it was over with Edward but she continues to act that way toward Jacob even when Edward Returns. If she really loved Edward she wouldn’t be a slut with Jacob. So my question is do you like the twilight Sequels? In my opinion this book is a horror novel not a love story. Edward is the Victim and the gay dog Jacob and the HO Bella are the killers. The only decent characters in the books are the vampires.

20090223065317AAreL6l	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	What do you think of this old Lady?	An elderly woman walked into the Bank of Canada one morning with a purse  full of money. She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money.       After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office.       The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'. The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets.       The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?'       The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.'    The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that..       The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?'       'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.'       'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 o' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently.       That night , the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.       The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that t he president's testicles were square    The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly..       The president was happy to oblige.       The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.'       The elderly woman did so with a little smile.. Suddenly the president noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied,    'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Bank of Canada !'

20090223045159AA3BssH	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	MONDAY'S JOKE - THE CHASTITY BELT?	A little naughty this joke so don't read if rude jokes offend you.      King Arthur was in Merlin's laboratory where the wizard was showing him  his latest invention. A chastity belt with a rather large hole in the most>obvious place.       "This is no good, Merlin!" the King exclaimed,"just look  at this opening. How is this supposed to protect the Queen?"        "Ah, sire, just observe," said Merlin. He then took an old magicwand and inserted it in the gaping aperture of the chastity belt whereupon a small guillotine blade came down and cut it neatly in two.        "Merlin, you are a genius!"  exclaimed the King. "Now I canleave knowing  the Queen is protected.       After putting the Queen in the device he set out on his Crusade. Several months passed and upon the King's return he mmediately assembled all of his knights in the courtyard for a 'short arm' inspection.Sure  enough, each one was either amputated or damaged, obviously by the guillotine. All of them except Sir Galahad.    "Only you" KingArthur  exclaimed "my one and only true knight! Only you of all my nobles! What is in my power to grant you, Mame it and it is yours!"        But alas, Sir Galahad was speechless.

20090223022837AAiBK1Q	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Read and tell me what you think??NOT LONG?	He was walking on the dark bridge, and the black sea under him. Loaded with sorrow and regret. He does not no where to go, but he  keeps walking. He somehow cannot stop. The feeling of grief is killing him. He stops for a while, takes a breath, like a dead body struggling to live. He takes a look at the sea under him. All black, and still. He wishes that he could burry himself here forever. But he is too weak to do it. Thinking about what he just done. How can he do this? How on earth can he think of this?. But he did. It happened, it is not a bad dream, it is not a sad movie. It is all real. He kept on walking. An endless journey that he is going through. But, for some reason, he feels that it is about to end. He is about to do the last thing. One more stop he has to make. One more thing he has to accomplish. That’s it, his lover’s house. He sat on the steps of her front door. Thinking whether to ring the pill or not. But eventually, he does it. He rings the pill. She opened the door,:    “ hello?” .    “ Yes, hey baby”.    “ who is it”.   She can’t see him, she can’t even sense him. He now knows that it was all real. That he really did it and he is now floating with souls in the black sea under his favorite bridge where no one can hear him, no one can see him, no one can notice him anymore.

I'm just curious of what peoples views are. Do you view people who tell racist jokes as a racist person? I      I have always viewed it simply as this: A joke is what it says on the tin - A joke. When you say I'm only joking, in a sense you where telling a lie. So I've always believed when telling a racist joke, it is a joke, something to be laughed at and not taken seriously.      I love comedians like Jimmy Carr because although he tells jokes that may be classed sometimes as sick to a certain race, it is all an act and he's actually a pretty nice guy. And I hate comedians like Roy Chubby Brown because they aren't actually joking if you get me.      What are peoples views though?

But I was curious as to why other movies that have sequels have taken longer to get in theaters.. for example some have taken a few years to make sequels and the Twilight Saga movies are being released within 1 yr or less than eachother. Also, I've seen that Summit might not make Breaking Dawn.. Do you really think they'd make all the books movies and not film Breaking Dawn?    I'm not a freak fangirl.. But I do love the books and loved the movie.   If your going to be rude, please don't waste your time answering.

20090223051013AAlCepa	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Ronn Moss - The Bold and the Beautiful?	I am from the UK but occassionally watch the US daytime soaps and saw some scenes with Ronn Moss which were really bad - he seems to growl with this put on drawl in his voice and even in non confrontational scenes he seems o.t.t. with his performances.      There have been scenes where in every scene when he is speaking to Rick, he says Rick at the end of every line - in fairness to him that is awful scriptwriting but you would think the actors would question the need for Rick to be said in every sentence lol.      Anyway, did some research into Moss's past gigs and it appears he is a talented singer and songwriter, who with a group, got to number 1 in the States and then he gave it all up to be an actor.      Does anyone know the reason - whether he was misguided - whether he was a talented singer/song-writer, musician.      Just seems crazy to me that if you are good at one thing, you give it up to do something your not that good at.

No sooner were the words out of his mouth when, sure enough, a curious Japanese tourist walked to the window, had a peek, and in a thick Japanese accent asked 'What you sell?'         One of the men replied sarcastically, 'We're selling ***-holes.'           Without skipping a beat, the Japanese man said, 'You doing velly well, only two left!'

20090223060248AAUiOlm	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	While visiting England, George W. Bush is invited to tea with the Queen.........?	He asks her what her leadership philosophy is. She says that it is to surround herself with intelligent people. He asks how she knows if they’re intelligent.      “I do so by asking them the right questions,” says the Queen. “Allow me to demonstrate.”       She phones Tony Blair and says, “Mr. Prime Minister. Please answer this question: Your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or sister. Who is it?”      Tony Blair responds, “It’s me, ma’am.”       “Correct. Thank you and good-bye, sir,” says the Queen. She hangs up and says, “Did you get that, Mr. Bush?”       “Yes ma’am. Thanks a lot. I’ll definitely be using that!”             Upon returning to Washington, he decides he’d better put the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the test. He summons Jesse Helms to the White House and says, “Senator Helms, I wonder if you can answer a question for me.”       “Why, of course, sir. What’s on your mind?”       “Uh, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or your sister. Who is it?”       Helms hems and haws and finally asks, “Can I think about it and get back to you?” Bush agrees, and Helms leaves. He immediately calls a meeting of other senior senators, and they puzzle over the question for several hours, but nobody can come up with an answer. Finally, in desperation, Helms calls Colin Powell at the State Department and explains his problem.       “Now look here Colin Powell, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother, or your sister. Who is it?” Powell answers immediately, “It’s me, of course, you dumb ***.”       Much relieved, Helms rushes back to the White House and exclaims, “I know the answer, sir! I know who it is! It’s Colin Powell!” And Bush replies in disgust, “Wrong, you dumb ***, It’s Tony Blair!”
20090223053836AAL1gN4	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Where to go?  (adult joke)?	The doc told him that masturbating before sex often helped men last longer during the act. The man decided, “What the hell, I’ll try it,”He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it. He couldn’t do it in his office. He thought about the restroom, but that was too open. He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe. Finally, he realized his solution. On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck. Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to masturbate.      He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to orgasm, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants. Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, “What?” He heard, “This is the police. What’s going on down there?” The man replied, “I’m checking out the rear axle, it’s busted.” Came the reply, “Well, you might as well check your brakes too while you’re down there because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago.”

I had lost my voice just prior to that with another round of the flu (another reason i quit, i was tired of not being able to speak).   even after two months of no cigarettes whatsoever, I STILL don't really have my voice back.  when i was smoking, I would get sick, but then my singing voice would come right back. now that I have quit, I sound like Janis Joplin. it's not that my voice is scratchy in the higher registers, it's that it cuts out completely in the medium/high registers and is scratchy in the lower registers. I whent from being a second soprano to being a tenor. what is wrong with my voice?!

20090223063852AAP9YJ9	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Should we kick out our vocalist and if so how do we do it nicely?	Hey so currently I have started a small band which I am trying to grow. And well our vocalist has just not been showing the effort that me (bass) and our guitarist have. Examples are how she always shows up late on practices, she never improves on her singing voice, and whenever we meet for practice she always seems to try and slack off. Now she has been a really good friend to me for years and I would hate to ruin our friendship but me and the guitarist believe that the only way for the band to grow is to kick her out. So should we kick her out? If so how to do it so that I still have a friendship. Also how should we kick her out if it comes to that (face to face, message, get a replacement ready before we do it, etc). Thanks :)

20090223065411AAo2hL3	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Why no emmy love for BSG?	So, I'm watching the episode Resurrection Ship and thinking oh my god. This is an amazing show. All of it, the special effects the acting the writing. Oh, and the music. As far as TV shows go, this has some of the best music ever.    After being blown away I started watching more often. Then I bought season 1 loved it. Then season 2 and season 3.   I watched the season 3 finale. Crossroads pt 2. At the end (if you've seen it you know) they play a cover of 'Along the Watchtower' share a 3 year secret and they freaked me out with the galactic zoom.    After the episode I was so blown away that I sat in my chair and watched the credit while reflecting on what I had just seen. And I continued to sit jaw dropped for like 10min.       Anyways so my question. How did the best series in the history of television (quote me on that) never win an Emmy?   Care to speculate?

Its only a quarter past 8 pm, man thats so uncool.   When you know there's a whole lot of reasons not to snooze.   Don't tell me your gonna let hopelessness subdue you.   And no I ain't trying to allude.   I'm telling you straight up.   There are no shooting stars that are gonna pull up to your heart and park.   To get what you want homie, you gotta fight from the start.       You see, there is no shortcuts, no yellow brick roads for you, the lil novice, to follow.   Create your own path as I once did.   Cuz now the dough on my clothes makes people take notice, that Ima balla.       So aight, go ahead sleep tight, while I go and get mine.   The dreams you'll be seeing tonight,   are gonna take place in an arena full of lights.   But when you open your little bitty eyes, its gonna see me on stage, rockin the crowd with you nowhere in sight.       Its neverending, the elating and faming of the venues,   I go to when I pick up my mic.   The letters that come out are just too damn intoxicating and savory to their insides.       So you better be ready,   everytime I spit my rhymes,   at the same pace as Lionel Messi is on his setting.   Or else your gonna drown in my confetti.   ? "Izteca Soul" 2009

The girl got knocked unconscious, and when she awoke and went outside, she found herself in a magical land inhabited by "little people" They tell her she is a hero because her house landed on an evil witch and killed her. They give the girl the witch's magical shoes. The girl asks how to get back home and they tell her the only one who knows is a powerful magician who lives far away. She set off to find him and had adventures along the way, including befriending a scarecrow, a man made out of tin, and a lion! They accompanied her on her journey and along the way they did battle with another evil witch who was the sister of the witch killed by the house, seeking revenge and to get her sister's shoes back.

20090223072941AAxS9J4	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What would be the purpose of this scene?	My friend and I were watching this James Bond movie on the weekend, and there's a part where this guy (from the villain's side) falls into the water with all these sharks. The camera is under water, and a shark swims up from below, and you can clearly see that it attacks/bites the guy between his legs. A woman on the boat (also on the villains side) laughs and says "Good! Just leave him". The guy is of course screaming from being bitten between the legs, and then another shark comes in and they eat him.      Neither the man or the woman were seen before or after this scene, and that is the only line spoken by either.      Obviously no woman would ever take delight in such a thing, and certainly wouldn't smile and leave a man to be eaten. So what is the point of this scene?      Is it supposed to be about female empowerment?    Some say it is funny because of where the man gets bit, and also because of the woman's reaction. Why would it be funny?
