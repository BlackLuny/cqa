But that doesn't nullify the fact that in previous generation games, fighting, ghost, etc. are based on your pokemons attack stat.

I just started playing last night and I was told that it would be good to specialize in a specific color set.  My boyfriend has a deck based in black and red and he kicked my butt.  Every time I played a creature he'd play a spell and kill it or bypass it and deal the damage straight to me.  It seems like the sorcery cards in black are very useful.  I'm wondering why people use the blue or green as they don't seem very powerful or maybe they're just slow.  What are the pros and cons of each color in the game?  What does one have that the other does not? Checks and balances?  Please help me understand so I can win a game.

20090223084348AAw89jE	Games & Recreation;Other - Games & Recreation	Question for other DMs in D&D...?	So I DM a D&D group every friday night and i've got a problem with one of my players.  He has been like this for a while, but its recently come to a volcanic eruption and im really sick of it honestly.    I played with him in another campaign where I wasn't acting as DM, so it wasnt so bad, but still very evident.      He is the kind of guy that makes a decision about anything (IRL or D&D) and even though he is wrong, he sticks to his guns.  An example would be like if he came up and said ' hey guys, the sun is red'    we could point it out right to his face that he is wrong, and he would just stubbornly disagree.        anyway, this past friday...we were playing...  In my campaign, there is a guy who may or may not be evil, the party hasnt figured that out yet.  and this guy is resting at his home.  so the party wants to go to his home and ask him what the heck his deal is.   Fair enough right?  thats exactly what i want them to do.  And just to make things a little interesting, there are 4 city guards standing outside this guy's house.  Sort of guarding him, sort of not.  Either way, they are not evil in any sense, just regular ol' city guards.      So this guy in the party decides he wants to run up to the guards and attempt to kill them to get access to the house.  Ok, still not a huge deal....except the guy is a paladin.  So I halted him there and said ' hey now, attacking city guards goes directly against your alignment, thats bad role-play and I wont allow it. '  I then gave him some options and ideas of other things he could try if he absolutly wanted to attack or get the guards attacked.  We ended up calling it a night and never resolved it.        Here is where I need some input.  I am thinking about letting him attack the city guards and just killing him off and not letting him roll up a new character.  As a DM its important to be very fair and not lean one way or the other for individuals, and i do believe this would be fair.      just looking for some input

20090223095731AACYVC4	Games & Recreation;Card Games	Playing Cards Probability?	A card is drawn from a bridge deck; show that the probability of obtaining either a face card or a spade is 11/26 where a "face card" is a jack, queen, or king.      I did this, but I don't get 11/26.       P(face or spade) = P(face) + P(spade) - P(face and spade)                           = 12/26 + 6/26 - 3/26                           = 15/26      What am I doing wrong? Please explain. Thank You!

I got a new laptop just a few months ago and decided to start getting my rom and emulator collection back together again. So I downloaded a few emulators (Note I only download emulators and games that I have purchased proper editions of in the past so this is perfectly legal) and some roms. But my problem is that every single Super Mario Brothers rom I download looks nothing like the actual game. I've tried multiple emulators and several different roms. This is my last resort I suppose. Any help would be awesome!      Some screen shots of what they all look like are in my photostream here...    http://www.flickr.com/photos/onlyletters...

20090223065001AAWQH4h	Games & Recreation;Video & Online Games	D&D 4th Edition, I'm a new player and need help!?	I've never played D&D but I've played Neverwinter Nights on the computer which to me feels alot like D&D. Anyways, I bought the three core books, Shadowfell, a pound of dice, and ordered a mini starter set, and two boosters.      Does anyone have any advice? I'm feeling like I'll probably have to DM, but I want to play as well-- although my family and friends were shy and reluctant to even join me at first, as I persuaded my family and friends to play with me, the easier it became to get them interested. Band wagon appeal is good, ja? But the thing is, I'm abit scared since I want to play, but I've accumulated I think .... five other players so far? And what I've been reading around the internet is that a good starter team is a DM + 3 to 4 players. I don't want to turn away any of the people I've asked though, that just seems rude at this stage, I've helped them make character sheets (I think, might have gotten some stuff -abit- wrong) and that is probably what piqued their interest in the game in the first place since my family & friend like games with choices and the what not.      Grah, sorry for being lengthy, I feel sometimes helps fit the person to answer this question into my shoes. I want to start playing soon before everyone just blows it off with not getting to play it. Please, can someone give me advice on:   How to DM   If I've got all the materials   If I can DM and play at the same time (possibly as a PC/NPC later on maybe ... I had thought up a plot twist to add in later in the story, maybe ... if I can't play or atleast play for long.)

20090223105838AAhMljQ	Games & Recreation;Card Games	In Texas Hold'em poker. The board shows a straight: 6-7-8-9-10. I have A & J. My opponent has K & J. Who wins?	6-7-8-9-10....   I would say, split-pot. Right?    Please correct me if I'm wrong.   But, the "basic" rule is, you use the 5 cards on the table + your own 2 cards to make the best hand out of only 5 cards.       So, I would make a straight, using my J to make 7-8-9-10-J, but so as my opponent.   Naturally, using a "sixth" card is out the question. Like I would say "My Ace is higher than your King." Totally wrong.       Also, what if my opponent has Q & J. I still have my A & J. Does he has the highest straight between me and him? Makign him the winner?       My thinking is : we're both straight. Same rank. Both straight flush or both not straight flush. Split pot. Right? Unless, when one has the A-K-Q-J-10 straight flush. This beats any straight what so ever, right?
