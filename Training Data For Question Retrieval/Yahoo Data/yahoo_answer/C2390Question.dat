20090128185102AAnS6Mh	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Questions about FASFA? ?	This is my first time filling out the FASFA because i knew it would be a pain, and i attended community college which is cheap so i paid out of pocket. Now i am transferring to the local university, and the people in the financial aid office are so unhelpful.       My problem is that i am classified as a dependent student, so i have to submit my parents tax information as well as my own. My mother is my only living parent, and she had no income, so she does not file a return. I do not support her, my aunt supports her.      When i spoke to the financial aid office, they said to just put zero when it asks for her income. The form also asks all kinds of questions about the deductions she took, and what form she filed, and what dependents she claimed, etc. I cant answer those types of questions.       I fear if i leave them blank my application will be deemed incomplete. I really need this assistance, because i support myself, and can not afford tuition.       What should i do?

20090128193920AAbpHDf	Education & Reference;Teaching	Please give this question your honest opinion. Inappropriate teacher conduct...?	I am 17 and a junior in high school. I have a math teacher who is 24, and this is his first year teaching. He is caring and a good teacher, but there is a big problem. we have a class of 17 and we have 7 students that are out of control. They have cussed, had inappropriate discussions, literally refuse to do homework or actual quizzes, throw fits over anything and everything, and have the teacher repeat things over and over again. Our teachers at our high school would not tolerate any of this behavior, even first year teachers have put a foot down in this situation, but this teacher is letting it go on and on, and to be plain, the rest of the class if sick and tired of this. I and a friend of mine have fought with these other students about this but it leads to nothing. There has been a time when a girl came back to school with a story about how she had sex up the rear in an alley way with another student, she didn't keep this to her self either. she talked about in class out loud. The teacher let this happen then later after class was over, she was in there TALKING to him about it. He comments and talks with her about it. Another girl says how she wants to be a prostitute when she gets out of high school, and he comments "Just tell me where your working." Now i know he meant to be funny but it was an uncomfortable moment. I now will not say Hi or talk to him, because I feel that he has crossed the line. We barely learn anything in his class, we never get anywhere, and its all about one side of the classroom. The students that rather learn and get on with the actual class are basically ignored. He wonders why we never know what we are doing, but how can we learn when we can't even hear him teach? There is a student that threw a fit over a quiz and refused to do it. Well he got away with not doing it and only had to sit in the hall for 5 minutes. He also has been rude and ignorant towards him and threw a marker once at the teachers back, and he only had to sit in the whole OUT OF CLASS for 5 minutes. I am just done with all of the ridiculous antics in his class. My friend and I wrote him a letter telling him what we thought and that all of it needs to stop, and we signed it with our initials. We hope this works or we will go to the principal. What do you think? And did writing a letter the best way to handle it?

A book report on:    They Say, I Say: The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing   By: Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein    Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein have put together a wonderful resource for intermediate to advanced writers in the form of They Say, I Say: The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing.

Graff and Birkenstein have put together basic templates for writers to use as their own to help those of all skill levels improve their writing through comprehensive techniques.

Graff and Birkenstein have presented these...

So here they are: I am at a Catholic private school with a 4.1 GPA, I am a competition pianist and have won many awards, I have gone to China to sing for Pre-Olympics ceremonies with my Honors Choir, I sang at an All-State festival I was selected for with two other people in my grade, I am a certified coach for Special Olympics in tennis and volunteer on Saturdays during the Fall and Spring, I was on JV tennis for two years, I have a part in my school's musical and will have a lead next year, I write articles for my newspaper's teen section online, I am applying for a spot on the fashion board at Nordstrom, I have a start-up jewelry business, I am vice president of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes club and will be president next year, I am starting an A Capella group at my school, I was president of my Choral Ensemble and will hopefully be president as a senior next year in Honors Choir, I am secretary of my school's Environmental Club, and I am a volunteer attorney for a Teen Court system (twice a month).  Also, I give piano lessons during the summer and I am hoping to go to a state funded science camp over the summer for four weeks.  I haven't taken SAT's yet, but I'm pretty good at standardized testing. Also, I'm taking all AP's and Honors classes and I'm in the top 10% of my grade (330 students).        Sooooo after all that boring stuff, these are the schools I like:   Boston College- my sister went there and I fell in love with it as well, for my own reasons!!   Cornell-they are one of the few universities to have a fashion program without being strictly a fashion/arts school   Tufts-I love the Boston area   UNC-Chapel Hill- I live in NC, so that should be in the bag   Colgate- It's in New York, which is my second favorite to Boston   Northeastern-alternate if BC didn't work out      Cornell is the only one with a fashion design program, but if I were to go to the other schools I was hoping to take communications classes at that school and design classes at a nearby college      Thanks everyone for your help!

20090128174642AArHvBn	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Do I have any sincere chance at attending an Ivy League University?	I'm Seth, 17 years old from Upstate New York and I want to know if I have any chance at all of attending an Ivy League University because of my very unique and very complicated situation.Here's the story from my first year of HS until now:      I started High school at a charter school.I was on the edge of passing or failing pretty much the entire year.(note: this certain charter school does not recognize anything under 70% as a passing grade).With me being as lazy as i was at the time and with the fairly small amount of work I had completed throughout the year it was a surprise that I still had a shot of passing by the time finals came up.    Once again, me being lazy, I pretty much failed to do any studying for finals.I can't exactly remember what I got on all of them but I know I had "failed"(under 70%) 3 subjects at the time. I believe they were History, Biology, and Algebra.    Now this certain school has a rule that you can attend summer school if you fail 2 less subjects but if you fail more than that you have to write a letter to them explaining why they should retain you as a student, either way you would have to repeat the grade.    Now imeediately when my mother got my report card in the mail and told me I had failed with no chance of attending summer school I can describe as falling into immediate depression.(Of course I had been lazy all year and I knew I was being lazy but growing up as a kid I was a natural at pretty much everything I had ever tried.I had heard the words "hard work and dedication" countless times but as far as understanding the concept, Ihad no clue)    So during this depression filled summerI pretty much functioned like a robot.I'd wake up, take a shower, and watch tv the entirew day.If I got hungry I ate.That was pretty much it.No interaction with anyone and I can honestly say that outside of answering someone if they had a question I didnt speak to anyone the entire summer.I got many comments about my emotionless facial expression.    So my mom actually wrote the letter to the school and they accpted me back.At this point I could care less.There was no way of skipping a grade at this school and in my depressed state of mind I decided that if I'm not graduating the year I'm supposed to(and with my firends)than I could care less if I graduated at all.I planned on dropping out when I turned 18.After telling this to my mom she said that if I followed through that she'd kick me out of the house.    So I went through the school year in what was without question the most miserable year of my life.The two things that kept me from thinking about suicide was that 1) I didn't have the sack to even think about it.2)hope for the future.    The career I planned on living(professional wrestling) doesnt require any form of academci record.That said, If there was any way for me to get back in my original graduating class I'd jump at it.    So I went through the year without a care in the world and failed again.The school kicked me out and I wasn't happy but I wasn't any more mad than I had been the entire year.    So in the summer I found an accelerated program that runs through the school district.You can attain your credits as fast as you can past the class and all the work is done individually on computers using the apex learning service.    Here's my problem.Outside of the obvious two shipwreck academic years had this new program is just that; a program.It's not really a schoool even though the school district does recognize the diplomna it gives when you finish  legit.Also, I hear a lot about AP classes(wich is non-existent in my situation), extra curricular activities(also non-existent), and reccomendations(existent but there are about 2-3 "intructors" at this place i attend).    Now I'm currently doing pretty well so far at this place(3.2 gpa so far) and I've developed the work ethic that I never had before but I've already pretty much come to the conclusion that even if i kept  good GPA and do well on the SAT that any Ivy League school opportunity for me is around slim to none and probably closer t none but I don't know how the college system works or anything like that so I just wanted some feedback from some people who are older and may have more knowledge on the subject than me and the people around me.    Feedback would be much appreciated

20090128184648AArXVvN	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	My teacher and I have this "thing" going on? (Dont judge until you read please)?	I am tight with my science teacher and track coach. He was my homeroom teacher in 6th grade, and I befriended him. In 7th grade I had him for spring and winter track and my friends had him as their eighth grade teacher. He is funny and extra nice to me, and we joked around a lot in track but he tried not to show favoritism in front of the team. Now in 8th grade he is my science teacher and track coach, and I go to him at lunch too.We bond so perfect its easier for us to converse in private. eventually we began what im pretty sure is "flirting" I'm POSITIVE its not just joking around. I'm no expert on flirting, but i know it enough, and its subtle like he wants to see if im quick enough to pick up on it.He's been married for 4 years, so I've kept my respectful distance.Hes 28 and last month his wife left him for good and hes really hurt. He came back after taking some time and needed to talk and vent to me one on one more than ever. In bonding we tried to talk about not personal stuff to save pain, but eventually we both talk about our problems and private life, comforting eachother. We are so close, and he's so sweet and I think hes becoming "interested" in me. I don't know if hes always felt like this so strong, or hes just on the rebound, or I'm reading his feelings all wrong and this is all in my head. I REALLY like him, but the school doesn't allow t/s relationships and I've never been involved with anyone before and I don't want him to get in trouble. I've never felt uncomfortable with him but now I'm confused. How can something so right be so strange!!! I wouldn't even know how to bring this up, or if he would approach me first, or wait it out. Please I need help whats my next step!! He's made me feel more special than anyone else, and he likes me for me, but where do I go from here? Am I in love?

20090128190420AA1pRwp	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Why do I have to be miserable just to pass school?	When I was in elementary school, I didn't care about school at all. I goofed off with my friends and played around in class. Most of my assignments were late, especially my science work (I hated science). This made my mom very angry with me. I didn't understand why. I passed every grade. I've never been held back.      When I was in 6th grade, my mother yelled at me (which she doesn't do often), saying that I need to straighten up and that if I didn't, she wouldn't allow me to be with my friends for the entire summer (which is torture to me because I love my friends more than anything) and I won't be able to celebrate my birthday (which is also in summer). When she told me that, I'd had my phone and computer privileges taken away (which was also torture) until she saw "improvement in my attitude and behavior". I only acted that way because I hated school and I just liked being stubborn and defiant. I liked it so much, I was willing to accept the punishment. But I didn't want to lose my birthday and my friends and my summer, so (as much as it killed me) I decided to work better. I saw paying attention and doing my work and handing my assignments in on time. It was worse than any punishment my mom ever gave me. I was miserable, but I did it to make her happy so she'd leave me alone. I passed 6th grade with straight As and she was proud of me, but it didn't really matter to me. I was just glad I was able to celebrate my birthday and spend my whole summer with my friends.       Before the school year started again, my mom told me she didn't want me to goof off again. I have to stop. So, just to make her happy and get her to leave me alone, I did something I never thought I would. When 7th grade started, instead of playing around, I actually paid attention in class and did all my work. I gave up my friends and I didn't make any new ones. I didn't talk to anyone. I studied everyday. I didn't watch TV, I didn't use the phone or the computer (except for school assignments) and I just read books and stayed in the house. I'd even skip meals to study and I didn't take care of myself. I did all of that just to make my mom happy and I'm still doing it (I'm in 9th grade now). I'm not lying either. I'm serious. And I'm completely miserable and my mother isn't happy anymore. I don't understand why! She wanted me to "straighten out" and I did. I don't see why she's not happy. I don't know anything else I can do. Is there anything left?

20090128185200AAaA5lE	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What are my chances of getting in to Loyola University of Chicago?	I am planning to transfer to Loyola for my sophomore year I just finished my freshman fall semester with a 3.2 GPA. I am confident I can do better and get into Loyola with 20+ credits and a higher GPA, but I do not want to risk waiting too long and getting rejected. I did okay in high school, mostly as a result of apathy. I had about a 3.3/3.4 GPA and my SAT scores were not that great... 930 with critical reading and math together. Do you think I should wait until the end of this semester to complete the required amount of credits or apply now with my high school GPA and SAT scores? Thanks!

20090128185707AAdYyuB	Education & Reference;Teaching	How can i confront my teacher?	i hate my chemistry teacher. im a sophomore (16) and only 4'8", no im not a midget. but im the shortest kid in my class and she seems to always pick on me. She acts like she's not trying to be mean about it but i feel like she only wants to embarrass me in class by using me as examples. like today she got the tallest guy and girl come up in front with the shortest guy and girl. she asked us to stand next to each other so when the shortest girl stood by me she was taller than me and my teacher kinda smirked and almost whispered that even our shortest girl is taller than me making the whole class laugh. She ended up making us do some dumb presentation on how energy and wavelengths flow by using the tops of our heads as the peak. Which technically doesnt make sense cause its now how tall or short the wave is but how long/short horizontally so i think she just wanted to humiliate me. Ive been dealing with this kinda stuff all year and want it to stop, so how? Should i try to arrange a meeting with her? oh and her procedure of how we line up to leave the room is tallest to shortest so im always last. i just think she dislikes me cause im short and shes kinda tall maybe 5'9" and maybe she had a bad incident with a short person. all i know is she is discriminating me and i think she could actually be fired, right? suggestions.

That is not even a full sentence, is it??!!..!........      Actually, it is:      "That that is, is; that that is not, is not."      So you an see clearly in this example how punctuation is important, to eve make sense of that sentence.            What do you think of this example?      "Woman without her man is nothing"      You may think this is a sexist remark against women, saying that they are nothing without their men. However, when you add the punctuation:      "Woman--without her, man is nothing"      You can see that the meaning of the sentence is completely opposite because of the added comma. In this sentence, it is saying that a man is nothing without a woman.      Just thought I'd share those with you!!      If you know more, feel free to share!

My son is 6 and in the 1st grade, Come to find out that today his teacher had him and some other children in line to hand in paper work and as they stood in line she told one boy"his breath smelled bad and he needed to brush his teeth better" She told my son that he needed to shower day and night even if there is school because he smelled bad.

20090128194126AA2R9Hj	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Dropping AP U.S. Government class and independently studying it?	I need advice.       I am currently a junior in high school, and I hope to go to UC Irvine after I graduate. This is my current class schedule:      World Comparative Literature (English)   Honors Chemistry   Journalism Production   AP Calculus AB   AP Biology   AP European History   AP U.S. Government      .. and I take Spanish at a community college.       For Government, we basically just read the textbook at home and she lectures about it in class. Honestly, I don't really pay attention to the lectures and I do fine on the tests because I read the textbook. It's second semester now, and each course is getting harder. I can't handle my teacher lecturing and picking on me anymore. If I drop my AP Government class but still study by myself for it and take the AP exam and pass, will that be okay for UC Irvine? Or should I just keep taking the class and deal with my tiredness?   Even though I'll still be studying for government, I won't be wasting as much time with it with her lectures. I'll then be a teacher aide during that class period, where I can relax and have study hall.       Thanks in advance!!!
