Our external water pipe running from the meter (by the sidewalk) to our house burst, and one of the plumbers we talked to said they'd use a mole instead of a backhoe to replace our pipe. We would love to avoid having our yard dug up with a backhoe, but don't know what the mole is, or if it's a reliable option. The plumber also said he would run the new piping through the existing pipe (ie breaking the existing pipes along the way). THANKS!

It filled with synthetic stuffing inside (not foam or down).       For a while it was super fluffy and it felt like sleeping on a big pillow. Now with use- it has become slightly-moderately flattened out. I'd hate to have to go and purchase another one since mine was rather expensive.  Is there anything I can do (inexpensively) to help it resume some of it's previous fluffiness?       I've tried shaking it out and throwing it in the dryer, but this didn't seem to really help that much. Any tips? :)

I need ideas where to shop, JCP had everything last month but now I want to order and they no longer carry the long sizes. Another thing is I wanted the hall runner to match whatever I put in Living room which needs to be big also 11 X 14 would be ok. I can't find these sizes of rugs affordable, except JCP but they have no big ones. I 'd like to spend under 1500 plus include a 8 x 10 for the dining room (not to match).

Hi,    We have 2 heating zones (upstairs and downstairs), forced hot air, oil furnace. Yesterday we lost heat upstairs, there is air coming from vents but its cold. There are short moments where we would get some hot air but then it starts blowing cold again. Downstairs - everything is fine. We tried changing the thermostat but that did not help...      I called the oil company and they sent someone over. We were told that everything is fine with the furnace and the problem must be with the "air handler".      I called HVAC repair and they said that the oil company should be able to fix it.      Can anyone tell me if there is a way I can fix it myself, or who do you call in this case?

20090128135035AA2A8Jy	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	What parts should I replace to fix my dryer?	I have a Whirlpool DX8650 electric dryer. It does not dry the clothes efficiently. It is producing heat, and from what I can make of other Yahoo! Answers either the heating element is working or it's not (so it's probably some sort of an obstruction from the vent and the heating element should be ok). Having said that, I'll be pulling it out to check what the problem is. The dryer is about 10 years old so while I'm pulling it out to check the the vent/hose, I figured I might as well replace the heating element because it's not like I'll be pulling it out again & getting behind the dryer anytime soon. After visiting the manufacturer's web site, I got the part list. I'll be replacing the heating element for sure, but wasn't sure if I should order & replace these parts as well (as I'm not sure how they work with the heating element) :       - Box Heater   - Thermostat   - Wire Kit (For heater element wiring harness repair)   - Fuse, Thermal   - Thermal, Cut-Off (Hi-Limit)   - Box Heater   - Wheel, Blower   - Housing, Blower      I just want to make sure that while I'm back there inspecting the hose, that I take advantage of my time there and replace some very old parts which I know will eventually crap out (which I'm sure they will soon because like I said, it's a 10 year old model).      Before you answer, take a look at the manufacturer's web site to see a PDF of the schematics / parts list.       http://www.whirlpoolparts.ca/repair_part...    (In the top left hand corner you'll see a dialog box that says "Model Search"; just type in WX8650).

My husband and I frequently entertain a wide variety of people, and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice in terms of furniture that wears well - and by that I mean that it maintains its "new" look without constant cleaning/repairs.  I want a livable home (not a museum- or hospital-type atmosphere), but I don't want scratched/dented/scorched/stained furniture to give me unpleasant memories of the guest(s) or event(s) that contributed to the damage.    I may be asking the impossible, but any "tried and true" advice is welcome and appreciated, from wood finishes to upholstery material, etc., or even just preventive tips.    In case it matters: there is NO smoking in our home, and I hint that guests should remove their shoes, but I don't force it.  (I have to remind my husband half the time.)

My wedding is on May 23 and the flowers I want are white roses, red tulips, green carnations, and another flower but I'm not sure what. I know I want it a dark blue or purple color (any suggestions would be appreciated). I like the posy or the nosegay bouquets (I'm not really sure what the difference is).    For one of my bridesmaids, I want one with a rather small (but not too small), tight bouquets of red tulips. The other bridesmaid is the same style but it's the flower I'm not sure about now.    For my bouquet, I want green carnations and white roses. Same style as the bridesmaids only a little larger, but not really big. Equal amount of carnations as roses.    About how much do you think that would be?
20090128141634AACMplE	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Buying New Kitchen Cabinets?	My husband and I wanted to buy new kitchen cabinets because our old ones are very small and don't even fit our silverware.  Although our kitchen is 15 x 8, most of that is a large breakfast nook.  There are 16 cabinets total (There is an area that used to hold the fridge and now has a table, which is where I would want a new counter and cabinets underneath).  The longer cabinets are 29 1/2 x 13.  The shorter, fatter cabinets (above stove) are 18 x 16 1/2 each.  The counter with the sink is 87 inches long (little over 7 feet) and that is including the stove but the only cabinets needed there are above the stove.  On the other side of the kitchen (with the table) is 4 feet long.  Below are pictures of our kitchen because it's easier to understand if you can see what I am talking about.  After looking at the pictures can you please let me know what you think new (basic stock cabinets) might cost??  Also if there is a place you reccomend using.  We don't have tons of money and it is very small.  I know you can't tell me exactly but a ballpark figure would be nice.  We have never done this before since we are first time homebuyers.  Any advice would be great too!       http://i46.photobucket.com/albums/f143/b...        http://i46.photobucket.com/albums/f143/b...        http://i46.photobucket.com/albums/f143/b...        http://i46.photobucket.com/albums/f143/b...

20090128142246AAbmSwm	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Replace windows without touching frame - need permit?	I took a risk in replacing couple old single pane windows without permit and the city inspector shows up and tells me that we need permit. My understanding is if we touch the frame then we need permit but in the place I live, it seems like irrespective we need permit. Now I am in a place where should I replace the new with old window (which is kind of pain) or I have to correct and follow code.   Follow code would end up throwing the new window, make a larger spacing, order new windows and then install (whcih would add 2 more weeks)      Just so that I understood the risk in the below situation  - what if I pay the permit but do not get inspection and let it expire. What would happen? Would there be a penalty later on?   Appreciate your thoughts.

20090225080235AAvu4zy	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	A problem with decorating my bedroom?	This is the first time of decorating since moving to my house. I hate wood chip and have just discovered why its in my bedroom. The inner walls are in a terrible state, chipboard with a bit of skim slung in odd places, bits dug out and altogether a sorry sight. I absolutely hate wood chip or anything else that does a similar job. I really wanted to paint the walls. I am decorating on a small budget so I cant get anyone  in to skim the walls, is there anything else I can do apart from putting up a thick wallpaper?

20090225074758AAiwIz0	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	What is the best odor eliminator for a poop-filled trash can?	Here's my problem: there are no public trash cans on my street and I live in the city. When I walk my dog, thus, I have to carry her poop bags back to my apartment building and use our trash can. I tie the bags really well and they are scented, but after a few day's worth of poops, the can is simply disgusting and the odor is horrifying. Can anyone recommend a really good, strong air freshener? I've tried    1) baking soda (doesn't work)   2) febreeze (only makes the poop smell like flowers)   3) bleaching the can between uses (that helps, but not much)   4) Lysol (again, same as Febreeze)      Should I try wood chips or something? Flushing it down the toilet is not an option, besides, the bags we use would still smell.    The joys of apartment living!    Thanks for any help you can give.
