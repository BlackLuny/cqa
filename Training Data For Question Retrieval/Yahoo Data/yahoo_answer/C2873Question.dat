20090130110524AAfMGwS	Dining Out;Canada;Winnipeg	Semi-Formal...Any dress ideas or stores to check out?	I'm in winnipeg and am trying to find a clubbing dress/clothes.  My birthday is a little less then three weeks away it's on Valentines...and I am in a mad panic because I can't seem to find the nice little perfect birthday dress...I've tried stores like Sirens and Garage but don't get me wrong I love there style's they just don't have the nice flirty fun colors as Im trying to stay away from black and grey. Does anyone have any ideas or stores I should check out? Please keep in mind im going out to a bar so I don't want something to slutty but nothing too conservative. p.s its a semi-formal social.  Thanks so much

20081112033934AAGAaKS	Dining Out;United States;Other - US Dining Out	How do valets in fine restaurants work?	I've never had to use a valet for parking before.  But I have reservations for a restaurant downtown with no street parking.  So I'll have to use the valet there.  How does it work?  Do I pay after I get my car back...and when I am done my dinner how do I let them know I want my car?  Will the host simply know and tell the valet so my car will be there when I get out?  I don't want to wait in the cold outside.      Should I use the valet key that came with my car?  (limits the speed to 40 km/h)...and would my date think it's a waste of money to use valets?

20090130194704AA9ZFxO	Dining Out;Canada;Toronto	What is your favorite West Indian food joint in the GTA?	I used to live in Mississauga and would get my hair cut at Trinbago, then go downstairs to Granney's for Ackee and Saltfish plus Bulla Bread and some pear. Plus of course a Champagne Kola and/or a Ting. Also I was recently up that way and was glad to see that Calabash (Trini) was still open at QEW & Erin Mills. They made some nice doubles and aloo pie. I live in the sticks now and dearly miss my food. BTW i'm not West Indian.. i'm Scottish/Canadian.
