92jr44kFaa	Don't mind them.  The republicans are still just a little sore from losing the election.  They'll get back in the game soon enough.  After all, you can always count on a politician to play games, can't you?|`|AA11702773	That would be 52% of the 60-odd % that voted?  Many of whom said they didn't like either choice?    If the Dems really thought this would work they'd be blazing full speed ahead to say 'WE did it'.  It is because even they must realize they are probably blowing our last reserves of future credit to feel good at this moment that they want cover for the bill from the GOP.|`|zBEzl2FLaa	hmmm... i had no idea 53% was a large majority... interesting|`|CgGVpUI5aa	I used to keep monkeys.  I fed them seven little cups of peanuts a day.  Every day before I fed them I asked them if they wanted four cups every day at this meal, or the other meal.  They always said they wanted more now, and they howled and begged when they only got three cups.  Someone has to be able to make the right decisions, and Obama is just another monkey.    James, if I saw you stealing my money, I would do worse than slap you.  No serious people think taking money from my business and giving it to a poor person will be good for the economy.  The majority of americans support obama, but most americans do not support his spending bills.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	The Republican Representatives and Senators were not elected to roll over for Obama - they were elected to represent their constituents, the majority of whom wish to oppose the Democrat agenda.    Obama and the Democrats still need to work with the Republicans if they want to enact their agendas. They'll need to compromise.     Stop whining.|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	Like demonizing Bush was tantamount to slapping the voters that put him in office, is it something like that?|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Somehow I never considered 51% a large majority, especially when the guy behind you has 49%.

What about the voters that did not vote for Obama and have conservatives representatives in congress?  Dont they deserve to be represented too?|`|AA10889282	Why do Democrats act like Obama won in a landslide? He only won by 2 percentage points more than Bush in the second election. Obamas "recovery plan" is likely to push us into a second Great Depression.

They have the right to disagree and so do I.  I'm proud of them for standing up against Obama.|`|loy04C98aa	As someone who voted for Obama let me give you a different answer.    It is their job to represent the other side of the discussion and their constituents who put them in office.     It is appropriate for them to point out where they find problems with the spending the President or the Democrats in the House or Senate are putting forward.    Just because a person supports, overall the President, does not mean that they must support all of his ideas or thoughts.  I personally do not support 100% the stimulus package as it came out of Congress.  I believe it is a patchwork of thoughts and ideas.  It is not well thought out, I don't believe.  It does not have the controls necessary to make it work.  It is not fully transparent.  It still has to much "pork".  I don't like the tax breaks, truly believe at this time in our economy we should not be giving any tax breaks to anyone, but instead should be tightening up everywhere.    Personally?  I think Obama needs to bring some people in like me who can look with a pragmatic and jaundiced eye at some of these things and really question them.  Things like $200M for lawn care and statue cleaning for the Washington Mall, really?  Who told you that?  Bet I could get it done for significantly less.    So that is why not everyone is on board.|`|AA11327241	They are unamerican!
e1z8pHfmaa	Yeah he turned a $600K investment into almost $15 million... he did it at the expense of Texas taxpayers.... but he did do it.    Here is an article from prior to his presidency.  It offers a pretty good summation of his career.  Poor job performance.... propped up by family friends.  It actually also describes JUST how he turned such a big profit on that $600K baseball stadium investment.  Not too hard to turn a buck when you have condemnation power at your disposal and $150 million of somebody else's money to play with.    Poor job performance.... propped up by family friends.  Well.... I guess that describes his presidency as well.    http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1...|`|73kknl3Qaa	nope...pretty amazing isn't it|`|AA11313983	He was more successful a businessman than Obama was a trial lawyer.|`|o08LJ9Jwaa	no|`|gmwW7femaa	Yes, he was a success. Thanks for asking.|`|v4qLlGGhaa	If he was, we need to see the proof.

So I guess that qualifies as a yes.    Pretty funny that I state a verifiable fact and still 5 idiots vote it down--ahhh-the liberal mindset.|`|wlRA8NJ4aa	No, he ran every company he started out of business.

9I3wHIdraa	You must be in Reserves or National Guard.  When you get activated you will go through processing including medical and dental. You will fill out a form where you can write in your condition and later tell the physician.  Have your medical records from your Doctor handy. If you are taking medicine take your prescription(s) with you.  When you are activated and you are having medical problems then just go on sick call, tell them your problems and see what happens.  Remember to get copies of all the paperwork for applying at the VA later.|`|AA11313983	It seems to me that you have a couple of options: deploy or face a fraudulent enlistment charge.  They physically examine you when you enlist, not when you deploy.  When you deploy, they check you eyesight and hearing.  Since you were fit enough to enlist and reap the benefits, you're fit enough to see some of the bad stuff, too.|`|81e525d2b0af9f7090cd857fd7b2095baa	Hmmm... a disease which cannot be definitively diagnosed suddenly pops up right before deployment.  I haven't heard of that one before.    What's your MOS?  You might have a particular job that doesn't require you leaving the wire.|`|6CfYiabAaa	Go to your tmc. Everytime you havea problem with it go again. Talk to your sgt and tell him what is going on. If it is a situation where you are going to endanger your life or someone elses than you should not go. They would rather you stay back till you are really cleared than medevac you out of country. Much less expensive!|`|uAE4WssEaa	If you have this condition, then it's medically documented. In the paperwork you faxed it probably says that you have this condition. The military medical personnel look at this paper work and decide if you are combat/ deployment eligible. If they say you are, and you have it in black and white, then what's the question?     If you have doubts, then don't enlist. If you are looking to join and have a status that renders you unable to deploy, then DON"T enlist. There are soldiers always covering down on other soldiers who medically can't hack it. If you feel that this is the case for you, then don't enlist. I don't want to have you in my unit if you can't hack it. My a** needs a battle buddy who sees 360 degrees not a battle buddy who passes out after a flare up. Consider the life of those around you in that situation. If you wouldn't want someone with your disease at your back, then you have your answer.
grKtTRYtaa	Makes me ill.    CPS has to do something.  Call everyday if needed.  You do not have to give your name;  they can't give it out anyway.  As a teacher, I had to do it several times,  state law or I could have lost my certification.  One time an 11 year old was beaten up;  he was  3 times the normal size but still 11.    CPS even got back to me with a follow up.  They couldn't do anything because his attacker was his cousin but did not live in the same house as he did.  (strange rule)  But they did file a police report.  I was very satisfied.    will be in telephone book under your state name.  I would do it for you if I could.  So sad.  CPS never told.  They will continue to return and file reports if no improvement.  Go for it.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	They will likely at least investigate.    Why do you think removal is appropriate rather then a requirement that they clean things up? That suggests either you are not thinking this through or that you have an ulterior motive.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	OHH YES..especially if there is animal waist around the children. That is a major health concern. Call the local animal control, so the animals can be removed as well.|`|AA12109395	Call Child Services immediately! They will intervene. And follow up.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	yes|`|AA10927745	lol no they only intervene if the kids in actual danger not because the families poor and sloppy..and have you seen an orphanage?  they're probably better off where they are.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	If they're doing their job, they will.    Report it.|`|XR03jIndaa	yes, they will intervene if its bad enough    EDIT: if they intervene and its bad enough they WILL remove the children. Give the parents a chance to clean up and if not then the kids will go into foster care if a responsible family cant be found.|`|MWHJqVavaa	Report it. They might just warn the mother to clean up her act, but at least it's a start. And they'll start paying attention to her! If you're worried, you can do confidentially!|`|AA11523164	they should. it isnt healthy or safe|`|AA12074512	if you call them|`|7Z09mZt3aa	Yeah, all they need is a complaint and they'll investigate....|`|jHXUNbYGaa	If you are THAT worried about it, why do you not offer to help clean!!!!!    No, they will NOT "intervene".|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	This one really depends on your idea of filth. I lived in a house we kept very clean, but my landlord at the time acted like we lived in squalor. We made a bet that within two days the place would pass any white glove test and it did and we got three months rent free for the bet.  Some people have different ideas of squalor. What you think of as unacceptable might not meet everyone else's smell test, but that said, if it seems bad go ahead and call.   I'm a bit touchy on this because I had a neighbor who constantly called children's services on me. Once because my son took to many baths. They claimed I was keeping him in the tub.  One case was when my son made a sandwich then ran outside and jumped on a dumpster to play like kids do. Our neighborhood had no trash cans, just city dumpsters. The neighbor saw it and claimed he was digging for his food out of the dumpsters. Of course the silly beach called every time one of my kids got dirty playing in the mud or dirt, but if these kids lives are beyond what is acceptable they will take some steps. it might not be what you like to happen, but some steps are usually taken. On the other hand they might just make a visit then close the books on it.  Your call..without having actually been there nobody can say in all honesty. I've called on people who had ten, fifteen cats and it smelled horrendous..nothing done. It has to be an absolute clear and present danger to the kids, not just dirty.  Be careful though. Sometimes people take calls very personal and sometimes get violent over it.
OyBuEpOTaa	Your quote is very useful in my argument. There are plenty that would force Islam!! You only need to listen, and read. Anyone may read Al Jazeera. What terrorists may be angry about may not be legitimate.Their agenda may not be what they say it is! In spite of how well informed we believe we are , we are actually in the dark about a lot. I don't mean US citizens only. Do we really know why the US supports Israel? I mean besides the obvious. Very few know.     We cannot and must not glorify what terrorists do. They simply terrorize. Not effectual.  A group of people suffers and dies, but it changes nothing.  The only thing we can hope for is new and better educated people involved in world affairs. We can all hope and pray ( in what ever fashion God provided you with).    How was Saddam Hussein and his brother involved with Hitler? Do you know that part of middle east history? Hitler's ideology is ingrained in middle east politics. Keep that in mind if you want to study history and how it still affects all of us to this day. Forgive and forget. I was told by an Iranian in 1980's during the hostage crisis, and I quote "I think it's horrible,  thank God Americans are forgiving."  Doesn't everyone need forgiveness, no one is innocent.

Pulling out of the Middle East to avoid war is no different than trying to ignore any other murderous, rage filled criminal.    And while I'm at it. America supports Israel. Always has, always will.  That makes alot of people mad, but when you shoot your mouth off, we can see the swastika tattoo on your tongue.|`|XpUF9f1Saa	True.

You guys really should learn to start reading between the lines. Obama is actually working for what Republicans want, but in a way that actually works.    Obama knows that kind of spending would never be approved, but then its not supposed to be approved. The idea is to increase confidence in us.      Look, Democrats are supposed to initiate this by bringing the bill forward, making them look good when they see that the situation is dire enough to require action. That increases their support among their constituents.    Then the Republicans are supposed to take away that pork you are complaining about, when they object to the spending. That makes them look good when it shows them as being financially restrained again, bringing their constituents back behind them.    Then they get the new bill, free of the pork, before Congress again. They vote, with a huge majority from both sides. Then we gain confidence in the government and in the economy when we see them working together. That we know they play games with each other, but that they know when to stop playing games and can get serious about really working together when the situation calls for it. They work together, and then we gain that confidence.    And even before any spending is done, our confidence level moves up and that convinces customers to start buying again, investors to start investing again, and businesses to start hiring again. Without any spending, and moving toward a private sector solution (restoring confidence so we do this ourselves), the whole thing is saved.          Only problem is, Republicans are not playing their part. Now a huge part of that is Nancy Pelosi, who got screwed when Republicans were in charge and now intends to return in kind. But Republicans are not helping anything when they throw their little temper tantrum about Pelosi and then refuse to do anything but complain.    It also isn't helping that Republicans are trying to ADD spending to the bill. That wasn't what Obama was wanting them to do nor expecting them to do, and that definitely shouldn't be what they are doing.    Notice that when they complain about too much spending, Obama takes that part OUT of the bill. But when Republicans try to add to the bill, he steps in the way. To anyone paying attention, you can see what Obama is trying to do. He needs Republican voters on board with this so they can get some confidence, too. They are customers, business owners, and investors just like Democrats. We need everyone gaining confidence, but it doesn't work if Republican Senators and Congressmen don't play their part.    They have to start cutting out the pork, as was their role when this plan began. But they keep wanting to add to the pork instead, replacing the current pork with pork of their own. That isn't what Obama wants, and sure as h*ll not what we need.    Republicans need to do what they have said they would do, which is CUT the pork, not replace it with more of their own. Nancy Pelosi needs to get over herself.     This plan can work, Nancy Pelosi and the Republicans just need to pull their sh*t together. And Republicans need to start acting like actual Conservatives, and start cutting instead of adding.

13KBWzBXaa	Many of your answerers mentioned "inflation" but none really explained how "making more money" equates to "inflation."    You see, the stuff they print isn't really money. It's like a receipt for money, except it's like they're giving you a receipt for something you never gave them in the first place.    Back in the old days, when you went to a bank and gave them some gold or silver coins (which ARE real money) they gave you a receipt in the form of a bank note. It had the denomination right on the note. A $5.00 gold certificate could be taken to any bank and traded in for a $5.00 gold piece, or 5 one dollar silver pieces. The government could only issue as many pieces of paper (receipts) as they had gold or silver to "back" those notes (or bills.)     If the government went and printed more currency than it had gold and silver to use as backing, and people turned in all their paper, the people would soon discover that the notes they carried were worthless.  But since that rarely happened, government could usually get away with that type of fraud and few people who be the wiser.    The problem is, if government is spending more currency than it has gold & silver (real money) to back it with, people catch on and come to the logical conclusion that the bills they have in their wallets are not worth as much as they once thought, and so when people trade their goods and labors (services) for "money" they require more of this money in exchange for the same amounts of goods and services.    We commonly call this inflation. Economists call this Monetary Inflation because it's a rise in the money (currency) supply, but not a rise in the wealth supply.    It's like the commonly spoken phrase "supply & demand" which means that if there's a large supply of something, the value of that something isn't as great as it would be were it rare. That's why topaz costs more than pebbles. Topaz has no real value. People like it because it's sparkly and pretty, but other than it's use in jewelry, it has no worth. Pebbles are used in a variety of industries, but since there are so many pebbles out there, their value compared to topaz is almost non-existent.   So it is with currency if government runs the printing press for too long.    What we need to fix this nation is a reduction in the money supply and some deflation to shore up the value of the dollar against other currencies.|`|wlRA8NJ4aa	"They" do.  That is where inflation comes from.|`|ebrlN6TXaa	Because we don't have more money in the bank.  We have been borrowing money from other countries to operate our own country.  Since, Bush bankrupted us to fund the war in Iraq.|`|CpUJI8adaa	it takes money to make money, they have to pay the workers to make it , so there you have it , it sound like a good idea. but they have to pay to make money. if it could be so easy everyone problem may be solved, wishful thinking huh.|`|wjSHPUiJaa	Because money is not wealth. Money is generated by economic activity such as production. It only serves as a medium of exchange and does not add to the economic activity in a county. Money by itself is worthless at least paper money is worthless. There is no intrinsic value, you can't eat it you might be able to heat your home with enough of it but it would be very inefficient.    If you just printed more money, you would have more in circulation and the description is "more money chasing the same goods" would have to lead to higher prices because buyer would have more money with which to bid on products and services. This is "Inflation", the increase in the money supply without a corresponding increase in goods or services.    Just prices changes in is not necessarily inflation or deflation, those are terms descriptive of the money supply.    If you could just print wealth, then why would anyone need to work or produce anything, just start up a printing press and everyone will be rich.    Check out the economic situation in Zimbabwe today. This is where the US is headed.|`|V8hiG6Jfaa	I take it you haven't taken 12th grade econ yet.    1 word: Inflation.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	The Fed's presses are smoking as we post.

Although I did fit it rather shady that his mantra was "change" and that he'd get away from "business as usual" Washington politics and all the insiders there.

emNCaAq7aa	Worse in what way?  Cocaine is pretty addictive, both physically and mentally.  You can easily OD and your actions while up are very erratic.  High quality cannabis can be a problem but it is not physically addictive. your actions if doing anything that requires a skill, like driving will be bad. Regular smoking of cannabis is just as bad for you as tobacco but not as addictive.  As far as police work goes alcohol use is the biggest problem in my area. People who are using alcohol cause the greatest problems in keeping the peace.    If you are talking about penalties in my area possession of less then 30 grams of cannabis is a misdemeanor, possession of any amount of cocaine is a felony. In some areas possession of less than 15 grams of cannabis is a ticket.|`|sbJCyPtlaa	all drugs are equally bad , it isn't the drug that makes it bad its more so the quantity you have in your possession|`|44707e7b798fd01392ccb15cec3384afaa	worse is the person even asking such a thing think about it drugs are drugs|`|AA10163820	Define "worse."|`|AA11089860	Cocaine is a hell of a drug.

However, I am going to say cocaine affects people worse. You also mention alcohol though. I would say I see more people do really stupid things while drunk than those on Marijuana.

See them every day at Bovington Only 250 million each nice toy. It opens up Abrams and leopards like sardine cans|`|3woyz5ucaa	Challenger 2 is better then the Abrams but is a lot more expensive. The Sabra is actually made for Turkey and is a huge upgrade of the M60 tank which was made in 1960. Israel uses the Merkava tank which one of the top tanks and its action was recently proven in the Israeli-Gaza conflict.    Overall:  I prefer the upcoming Black Eagle Tank and T-95 MBT's (Place of Origin: Russia) which are expected to be tested in 2009. The Chinese also have an elite tank known as the Type 99, but I would prefer M1A2 Abrams over that.    Edit: Siggy above me answered mentioning the M1A3...there is no such tank and every tank can fire while moving. Watch some WWII footages please.|`|bGuVAltxaa	How can you say which one of these tanks is best? they have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan and apart from coming up against a few old tanks at the start of the conflict in Iraq, they have not come up against other tanks, I would like to see them come up against a good Russian or Chinese tank, and then you could answer the question properly.|`|i5FP4Vbraa	The best tanks have British armour.

In terms of performance its comparable with the abrams but its modular and much easier to maintain on the battlefield.  The Abrams is a monster to maintain - and on protracted deployments (e.g. Iraq) its a disaster.  Example - the engine of the Leopard is a standard off the shelf diesel engine, parts are easy to come by as are qualified people to maintain it / the Abrams engine is a converted jet engine.  Sabra is an old design - coming to the end of its days.  The IDF would have gotten rid of it years ago except its opposition doesn't have anything better (tank wise).  Some features of the Challenger 2 look interesting but are still classified - so I cannot comment further.  So my vote is Leopard 2 as no. 1 and Abrams as No. 2 - the Sabra - distant 5th.|`|NnY1wG11aa	Tanks are like "horses for courses" no one MBT can win at all things, such as, price, reliability, hitting power, maintenance and the cost of maintenance, and many other things.  Its no good having the best tank in the world if it cost a fortune to build, run and maintain, its no good having the cheapest if it weak and infective.    During the second world war the Russian T34 was a very good tank but it was not the best individual tank (one on one), but it was the easiest to build, run, maintain and repair with a good punch so consequently it was the best all-round tank of WW2 with the American sherman coming a very close second, both were winners by shear numbers.    The same applies today, whats the point of having a 65 ton beast if all you are fighting is terrorists armed with AK47s, there has to be a blend in Price, Hitting Power, Amour, Speed, Reliability and Maintenance.Downtime.    So depending on what is required, will greatly influence what is the best tank you consider to be the best.    What I mean is, for a short conflict you want the biggest, meanest tank you can lay your hands on where price is low on your priorities.  But for a long drawn out conflict where you will need many more tanks you need a blend where price of construction, maintenance and reliability become far more important.    So its not really the best tank but which is the best type of tank.|`|tVoMXFDRaa	Abrams|`|AA11570236	The Abrams,battle proven.Destroyed hundreds of Iraqi tanks in one day.|`|o2c01JsUaa	But if 9/11 never happened think of the joy you would have robbed those people of Did you see them jumping for joy over the death of 3000 women and children of the great Satan|`|AA11369432	The one that is out of order.|`|81e525d2b0af9f7090cd857fd7b2095baa	Whatever with the Sabra, and the as far as the Abrams goes, well... you don't build 10,000 flops.

JxaE1azvaa	My boyfriend is doing his basic training for the army right now! Just keep yourself busy with school, or hang out with friends and family. At first, I didn't feel like doing a thing, except moping around the house and generally being depressed. Even still I get a little sad, but I know I'll see him in a couple of months.    I just started going over to his parent's house and visiting his mother, cleaning up my own house, and taking care of school work. You'll definitely miss him tons no matter what, but after a while, you'll start getting letters, and possibly phone calls :o).    When you get an address, send out supportive letters to your soldier! Let him know that you're there for him, and that you love and absolutely support him. I know that it will make him happy to know that you'll be there for him when he graduates! Understand that any contact with you or family members will make his day, as he will be going through a tough time.    It'll go by fast... just do what you normally do, and I'm sure you'll be fine, hun.    I would suggest joining this little group of ladies! http://www.militaryissuedgirlfriends.com...    They're all very, very supportive and they know what you're going through, so I would suggest giving it a try.|`|AA10025824	Start a scrapbook.  Leave a lot of empty space for you two to fill in when he gets back.|`|LEBV1FPuaa	Find a female friend and go toy shopping with him before he leaves.|`|DgLBtjWoaa	Not cheat.|`|rSwce38saa	LMAO, I agree with ^^.    But for real, you'll start to feel alone the first month or so, but try to keep yourself occupied. Take up some classes, tutor, work around the house, garden, and pray for him.      Hope he stays safe.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	Consider a hobby as well as writing letters.  His first couple of weeks he won't be able to call that much but when the time goes by then he can call more often.  If you want your relationship to continue past him graduating basic then you should consider thinking about what you and him are going to do to stay in contact.  If you and him don't get married then he will be required to stay in the barracks while single.  Another thing you can do is get with friends who already went through what you went through now and had loved ones go into the military.|`|EM2Mn98Qaa	Pick up a hobby, join a young women's association, read some good books.  The important thing is if you are going to get married you need to get used to him being away for extended periods.  Some units have organized activities for spouses/significant others, so you can ask him about that (probably best to ask after basic training).  Just make sure you have a good strategy for keeping yourself occupied because you will have more times like this and you can't let them get you miserable.|`|d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	Distract yourself from thinking and being reminded of him. Sounds cruel, but it's not. Don't watch your favorite movies, no romance movies, avoid places that remind you of him etc. This isn't to say forget about him, but don't torture yourself by doing things that overly remind you of him. Make sense?     If you cheat on him, don't tell him until he comes home. He doesn't need to know about things you are doing when he cannot be there to deal with the situation. So if you cheat, do it, and don't torture him by telling him.|`|NDTLeIUKaa	http://deploymentlink.osd.mil/deploy/fam...    if your serious about him, join a support group (groups of girlfriends whose boyfriends are deployed, etc.)  or take up a hobby where you have to go somewhere to do it, like a flower arranging class or something.  or spend time learning about the Army so when he copmes back you can talk to him in his new language.    http://www.all-acronyms.com/tag/army_sla...|`|uAE4WssEaa	Be supportive. Be faithful. Be honest. Show your soldier that you have what it takes. Write him often. Hang with peeps. take up a new hobby that takes up time and energy. Exercise. Take an online class. Research the Army acronyms so you can understand what he's talking about when he tells you he went to clothing and sales to buy ACU's and new PTs. Or what his MOS is. Or PMCS the 5 ton PVT. He will be very appreciative if you show an interest in his new Army life. Talk to other military wives and girlfriends online. Wax your car. There is endless possibilities. Get creative! Get used to being away from him, The Army doesn't do lots of dwell time, but it can be done. I'm Ten years in and I love it, and so do my my wife and boys. You can do it too if you put in the effort.|`|tm4TxvAdaa	Girl my boyfriend left just last monday ..

It doesn't matter what your personal opinions of it are, it is that woman's right to choose what she does with her body....     But EDUCATION IS KEY! If we can educate the World about safer sex methods women will have to not choose between abortion, adoption, or becoming a mother.|`|7mOfekBWaa	It depends. Religious fanatics will say it's bad because something about jesus god and how mary never got knocked up.     The fact of the matter is it's a choice. Nobody is FORCED to have one.

You must both search for answers in the real world, but also search yourself.|`|Gmfht2BFaa	I think that if a person made the choice to have sex then they made the choice to have a baby. That child should not pay the price for the stupid mistakes of the parents. That is a living breathing human that deserves a life.     If a person was raped, then that baby STILL deserves a life. The baby should be born and put up for adoption. You may think this is wrong but there are SO many people out there looking for a Healthy baby to adopt.     Every Child deserves a life. You were given a life, why not let someone else have a chance at it too. Abortion is horrible, and should be banned. Unless it is a medical EMERGENCY!!!!

But it is best for mother and baby and society if every baby is desired and cared for so although abortion is a "bad thing" it is a necessary evil. Abortion should be safe and legal and very rare in an ideal world.|`|h6STaCmNaa	Its bad because you have to live with that forever knowing that you killed your own flesh and blood!! This is why everybody should wait to do ( you know what) till your older and married because if the father finds out that your having a baby then he might run and be scared, so then who is going to support you!! Maybe your mom or dad! But then what happens to the poor child that has no real father!!! Imagine your life with ot a real father that would make you feel sad and left out!! :) glad to help!!! :)|`|W6uHaI1kaa	Abortion is really bad if you think about it. its killing a little baby that doesnt deserve to be killed. In the old days babies used to suffer. they used to cut them or drown them. they dont need to get killed. especially if they can be adopted to loving and supportive people who cant have babies.    On the other hand, many people have made mistakes. Some times they cant go threw labor with out dying. Sometimes people need to gice abortion. Especially if they were raped or abused.     Here is a good picture that is not harmful-    http://www.stoptheaclu.com/wp-images/abo...|`|pa4feXGPaa	Many people believe abortion to be murder but this is not the case. If there wasn't abortion then there would be many unwanted children that lead horrible lives. I'm not saying that all children that are aborted are unwanted but I believe that the majority of them are and also I'm not saying that all children that could have been aborted and weren't lead bad lives. But abortion is a must have, in my opinion. The situation that has persuaded me is: what if a sick pedophile father rapes his teen daughter and she becomes pregnant? Not having abortion would force this teenager to go through the painful process of having a baby.|`|f7a27dc3bf1ef3fa5b6d27e18088be8eaa	Abortion is a good thing... for many many reasons....    First off, welfare makes up 85 percent of unwed mothers.... so a single person who has a kid is much more likely to end up on welfare....    Second there are people who will get abortions anyway... there ends up being back alley doctors.... Abortion was illegal before and many women died because of back alley doctors....    Thirdly if abortion becomes illegal the subject will become hush hush, you know like drugs, only able to talk about it in secret with people who do or know,,,, So people who are fully informed on the subject of abortion will not be able to sit down and have a conversation of the pros and cons.... a scared teenager is only going to hear the pros and end up doing something she might regret for the rest of her life... where as today it's an open subject... open for debate etc.....     Abortion should remain legal and it should be up to the parents to teach their children sex education and right from wrong... not Uncle Sam....|`|n206tDKlaa	The most horrible thing ever!!!  watch this    Lets just make all types of murders legal...killing an innocent baby is a selfish act, as well as an ignorant one. The people who do not agree with me probably have had more than one abortion and are trying to deny the fact that it is MURDER !!!    It is not nobodys business, If a woman kills her child for selfish reasons, IT IS MY BUSINESS because i have a heart, give me the child, I will give it the love that you can't. Stop feeling sorry for yourselves , geez.    have you ever heard the quote "tis better to have loved, than not to have loved at all"......same thing goes for life!

If the child is endangering the mothers life that is the only exception for abortion, but killing an unborn child is morally wrong, actually if you were to murder a pregnant women it would be considered two accounts of murder, funny huh.   For ur essay it is best to mention some thing like this   Well the best way to think of it is to picture your mother at the hospital wanting to abort you, its a bit scary since she could have killed you, but your still here. YOur mother loved you enough to keep you to let you live, wouldn't you do the same for your own child even if you didn't want to keep it.   And lets say you abort your first child because you weren't ready, later on you had two more children, how would they feel if they found out that you aborted their older sibling, they might have wondered it could have been me.

N93Ax4Wnaa	When Qing Dynasty fell in 1912,    Republic of China (ROC) was formed by Dr. Sun.    Under Republic of China, two major political parties were working together to defeat the warlords(left over generals, governors, of Qing Dynasty who took the chance to become mini emperors) ALL OVER the places.  The two political parties were  1.  KMT, or Nationalists.  Founded by Dr. Sun.  2.  CCP, or Chinese Communist Party.    However, when Dr. Sun died of illness.  Jiang Kai Shek took over after he eliminated all oppositions in his own party.   He had the advantage of having the control of military because he was once the president of a military school...many military officers were his students.    Jiang Kai Shek, with the support from the United States, suddenly ordered the massacre of CCP.  All CCP members, whether you were a government official, or a school teacher, would be arrested on sight and to be shot on the streets.    The communist party fought back with a ROC (Republic of China) troops still under their control.   Facing superior enemies forces, the CCP was forced to run and hide in the mountains after suffer heavy losses.      Jiang Kai Shek sent troops to exterminate the CCP multiple times and failed.   He only succeed on the 5th try which one million of his troops completely surrounded the mountains and were pushing forward step by step.   The CCP was forced to relocate after lost 90% of their troops.       Then in 1930s, Japan invaded as Jiang Kai Shek was about to finish off the CCP.    Two KMT generals in northern China, both were former warlords, kidnapped Jiang Kai Shek to force him truce the CCP so all Chinese forces can be concentrated to deal with Japanese invasion which was seen as the greatest threat to the Chinese nation at the time.    Jiang agreed and he was released by the two warlords unharmed.   (he immediately arrested both and executed one of them, while placed the other one under house arrest for life).  However, he did truce the CCP and started to move his troops to deal with the Japanese.    The Japanese invasion did not end until 1945 at the end of WWII.   (70% of all Japanese forces were in China fighting Chinese during WWII).   After WWII, Jiang Kai Shek immediately resumed the civil war with CCP as he had 4x as many troops as CCP while equipped with superior weapons, also controlling majority of cities where industries were.    However, KMT was corrupted so badly under Jiang.  CCP had way more support from civilians.   After 4 years of civil war from 1945~1949, Jiang Kai Shek lost everything but Taiwan. He packed up everything including entire gold reserve of China and moved them to Taiwan.   As the CCP were ready to take Taiwan, the U.S. sent 7th fleet to intervene.   The CCP with only a handful of surrendered/switched side KMT warships and warplanes, were unable to take Taiwan.    CCP on mainland then established a new government called People's Republic of China (PRC).    Jiang kai Shek ruled as ROC president until he died in his 80s.   Then his oldest son took over his throne and ruled until he died as well.   Taiwan only became Democracy in 1996.      Today, mainland China is called PRC.  While Taiwan is still called ROC.  PRC constitution vowed to reunite with Taiwan using force if necessary.  ROC constitution still claim to be the legal ruler of all of China and vowed to retake all of mainland.     In 1970s, the U.S. was forced to accept PRC to replace ROC as the representative for China in UN after the overwhelming votes for PRC by smaller countries who were not hostile to CCP.  However, United States and its allies continue to sell weapons to Taiwan and vowed to defend it if PRC attacks.       Today, most western media wrote their articles in a way that as if Taiwan is a different country bullied by China.  And they highlight that Taiwan is "democracy" as if it was the reason why they support them...and as if they were democracy since the beginning.  However, it runs in "tradition".|`|qjMP3EiGaa	My china is from Great Britain, so it can't possibly be communist.

Japanese occupation forces fought with rebel groups of communist revolutionaries, equipped with weapons from the Soviet Union.

c30166373f799ccf3b6182600c682717aa	Honestly - just go to the courthouse, talk to the judge and face the music.  If you've never been in trouble before, they may just give you a Rule 8, let you pay the fines out and give you a deferred - it also depends on what the citation was actually for.    Since you have been pulled over a couple times since then, I would suggest correcting whatever it is you are doing that keeps getting you pulled over.  Do you want to keep watching over your shoulder and worrying every time you get pulled over if this is the time you are gonna get hauled in?    Your luck will run out eventually - it always does.

mvl44vnKaa	He had a fair trail he gets what he deserves!|`|Qou0CLwiaa	He was allowed to bring witnesses. Even the Repubs were willing to bend over backwards to give all appearances of fairness. They didn't have to let him give his speech, but they did.    I think his complaint really was that there are no standard burdens of proof required in such a trial. That is a matter of the State Constitution though, and I am sure there are ways to modify it. Not while you are on trial though.    His secondary complaint seems to be that it is somehow unfair to impeach in the House and then convict in the Senate before he is tried in criminal court. But the charges are different, and the separation of powers in the State Constitution give the power to impeach and remove to the Legislature, not the Courts. Again, a Constitutional issue brought waaaay too late.    We will see how strongly he feels about this, or if it was just posturing. If he feels strongly, he will all but dedicate his life to modifying the Constitution to right the wrongs in case this happens again.     I don't think I am going out on a limb to say that is not going to happen :)|`|5YTkGB5yaa	As crazy and corrupt as the guy is he should have at least had an opportunity to bring forward witnesses in his defense at his impeachment.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	He had his chance to speak, and he clearly didn't have a case.    He WAS allowed to bring witnesses, just not certain ones that would prejudice his Federal case.    I'm a liberal, and even I think he's a crook.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Yup.   He had 43 extra minutes during his impeachment trial to address the issues he was being charged with.     Instead he chose to talk about all the 'good' things he had done as governor.     He knows he is toast.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	He had every opportunity to make his case at his hearing, but he chose not to. He's innocent in his own mind, that's how he could be such a "player" in corruption. He had no evidence. In all of his appearances on TV and finally at his trial, he offered nothing.|`|AA10599026	You may have noticed that the hearing -- it was not a trial -- is over and he's already been impeached. He spoke in his own defense but was not sworn in.    But the answer to your question is that under the Constitution, in a trial, an accused person has the right to confront his accuser, to call witnesses in his own defense, and other things to show his innocence. Since this was an impeachment hearing and NOT a trial, he didn't get to call witnesses. He could have testified but he refused to be sworn in (that would mean he could be asked questions under oath, which he clearly didn't want to do), and just made another speech. If he had evidence, he could have brought it, but clearly the case was pretty straightforward.|`|HBUO10i7aa	WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HIS HAIR WHILE HE LAMELY TRIES TO DEFEND HIMSELF! THAT'S SOOOO UNFAIR.|`|fZDz8yWYaa	It wasn't  He had all the proof necessary to impeach him and guess what-if he hadn't been such a lazy scumbag politician he would have gone through the work to get a case he was sure to win and get plenty of witnesses.|`|et39TGIsaa	Well, it wasn't a trial, it was an impeachment hearing.  The Senators who heard the evidence unanimously agreed that it was bad enough for him to be removed from office.  And the charges and evidence they brought against him were pretty bad.  Continually making an *** out of himself didn't help either.  He also refused to speak on his own behalf at these hearings.    We'll have to see how this goes if they decide to go through with criminal proceedings.  I haven't heard anything about that yet.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	there is a difference between rights at a regular criminal trial (which has not yet happened) and impeachment, which is not based on criminal standards.   He was given opportunity to address the issues beforehand, but did not. The witnesses could not be allowed, since it would have conflicted with and hampered the criminal proceedings.   Asking the Illinois govt to work with him, would have involved having persons willing to defend him. As it is, he blatantly thumbed his nose at all of them by his grandiose behavior and no concern for the harm his actions did to the state itself.

HH5mlAHhaa	Question 1: Im not sure if there are any volunteer work you can do, but you could probably call the Juvenile Detention Center in your area and ask if there is any thing you could do to volunteer. You could also try calling around to different shelters in your city and tell them you want to volunteer and ask them what you could do. Question 2: First things first, finish you high school education, then enroll in college for Criminal Justice. Once in college they almost always have internships. I'm not sure where you live, but in Iowa to be a probation officer you have to have a Bacholors Degree and corrections only requires an Associate Degree. Question 3: You would be defending juveniles in court. Juvenile Lawyers are like any other lawyer you will have to do the same classes as any lawyer would and then pass the bar exam. Good luck I hope this was helpful.

I take it you are from around that area   and know the weather etc ?    It sure is beautiful country up there...

If it's not spelled out in your contract you will pick your MOS at the MEPS (military entrance processing station) where you sign all of your paperwork at the time of enlistment. If that MOS requires a clearance you will fill out the application for one right there and it should be approved in about 3-4 months.
BrjZhySIaa	The government seems to be moving more towards a Monarchy day by day.  You know what they say; power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

I would like to know what "this" means when he said 'THIS would be easier'.|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	What is the government doing, interesting question.

This is done while the agency and or the F.B.I. conducts an investigation into the shooting. You have to realize that although we trained for this type of situation very few officers will ever have to use deadly force. It is very traumatic for the officer if he does have to shoot someone. They need some time to get over the trauma. After the investigation is complete and the officer is cleared by a doctor he will reassigned to the street.  To your other question. The paperwork varies from incident to incident. For a minor traffic violation they have to fill out and file a formal complaint to the court.|`|n3ndLgh5aa	The reason why you get desk duty is not because you used your weapon, if that was the case....we would hesitate a lot more to use force when needed.  You get desk duty because sometimes it is easier to investigate your case while you are not on the street.|`|mlDV1Xsqaa	I think I understand your first question. If an officer is involved in a shooting their needs to be an investigation. Not only that, but in my department, you have to go through debriefings and counseling sessions if you are involved in a shooting before you can be back on the street.  The amount of paperwork necessary is going to depend on the case, how many people are involved etc. For each traffic violation I have to fill out a narrative, suspect information, vehicle information, times and dates etc. It is usually a one page report. This includes even warnings, which can be a pain in the butt.|`|J6ZZqnVVaa	they aren't PUNISHED with desk duty, they are put on desk duty until they are cleared to return back to work.  shooting another human being, (at least for people who have a conscience), is a tramatic experience.  they usually have to have psychiatirc help to make sure they are able to return to work.    for traffic tickets, no paperwork is required for some departments, more for others.

AA11209233	The big issue was over a clause that all steel used for stimulus-funded projects must be from the US unless that would raise costs by more than 25%--some are pointing out that it goes against the spirit of trade agreements we have with other countries.    There is some argument over whether Bush's ban on Project Labor Agreements for federally funded projects should be lifted.  PLAs favor labor unions.  Banning them favors non-union shops.  Usually, this favor is extreme--if there is a PLA, a non-union shop will rarely get the contract, and if there isn't, a union shop will rarely get it.  It used to be that states and localities had more control over whether they wanted to use a PLA or not--there are pros and cons of doing it either way, but the ban settled that on a national level when federal funds are used.  There is a lot more to them than that, but the union issue is the main issue they are arguing about.    Some are arguing over some of the smaller line items in the package, such as money for contraceptives, family planning, the National Endowment for the Arts, and other things that democrats want funded that aren't exactly going to stimulate the economy.      ACORN funding was exaggerated by the conservative press.  There is $750 million that will go toward specific purposes in fixing the housing market, and it is likely that ACORN will bid for contracts to get some of that money.  There isn't a provision to give ACORN anything yet--they'll have to compete to get any of that money.    I'm not commenting on Daschle until I hear more about it.  If he made a mistake, fixed it and paid his taxes, I don't care.  If he was trying to cheat on his taxes and got busted, I do care.
ODTe2l77aa	There are several reasons.  Some are political and some are social.    At this point more than ever, people are interested in the lives of celebrities.  Tabloids make millions, even sleazy blogs are earning more money than a hard working citizen.  Much of the entertainment media is choosing Obama to be a hot topic because he makes money.  He is a relatively good looking guy, who just won the biggest election in US politics.  He is also very charismatic.    The political reasoning behind allowing Obama to be turned into a celebrity lies with the fact that much of America and the world, is feeling bad.  George Bush solidified his legacy with not only 75% of Americans, but also much of the World as a bad leader by leaving us in the economic mess we are in.  The fault does not, necessarily lie with him, but he will take the blame for a good bit of history until something happens to clean up his name.  Obama, to many people, represents the hope and change that they want after the Bush legacy.  The ideas behind this are simple: As long as people feel happy, they will be happy.    A lot of people know little about Obama besides the hero that he as been painted as.  But if people are happy, and if they think the economy will get better, then chances are, the economy will get better.    Obama is also popular with other nations.  He is a minority in America, and he is young, in stark contrast to George Bush, who has been established as "bad" by many, many countries.      This is why we are turning Obama into a celebrity.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Media Propaganda.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	umm he's kinda black.    ::edit::  I think I will vote for the STEELERS *wink*|`|x12mMdApaa	the dem's have made him out to be our salvation, When the owner of the steelers is thanking obama at the end of the super bowl....... did I miss something was he on the field last night?|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Hello???

ctcCPMdCaa	No, he did confiscate gold.  Executive order 6102 forced everybody to sell their gold to the Federal Reserve (for $14 more than it costed per oz. before he passed it), because 6102 also removed the gold standard, and the price of an ounce of gold was artificially raised.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_O...    Executive Order 6102 is an Executive Order signed on April 5, 1933 by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt "forbidding the Hoarding of Gold Coin, Gold Bullion, and Gold Certificates." It required all persons to deliver on or before May 1, 1933 all gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve. Under the Trading With the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, as amended on March 9, 1933, violation of Executive Order 6102 was punishable by fine up to $10,000 ($166,640 if adjusted for inflation as of 2008) or up to ten years in prison, or both. Because of this forced immediate sale of gold to the Federal Reserve at the government set price of $20.67 per troy ounce, this Executive Order is often referred to as the Gold Confiscation of 1933. Shortly after this forced sale, the price of gold from the treasury for international transactions was raised to $35 an ounce; the U.S. government thereby devalued the U.S. dollar by 41%.    So thereby the dollar was devalued 41%, along with the treasury buying the gold from everybody at an artificially raised price.  Which resulted, obviously, with inflation.  Then came the social programs and the New Deal, which forced more devalued money into the system to pay for them.  If it wasn't for WWII, the depression would have continued for who knows how long, and perhaps even a crash due to hyper-inflation.  Similar to what Barry is doing.  Watering the system down with worthless paper that loses it's confidence as more and more is created.  This is what people don't understand;  even if jobs are created, all of this extra money is going to damage the purchasing power when it gets circulated into the system.|`|AA12191521	yes, because of what he did the depression was longer and deeper in America than in any other country.

Today, it's less than 10%. Despite ideologically-driven reality-averse efforts to bankrupt the system by conservatives, I'd call that a success.    "Works Programs" - To be sure, some of them were highly dubious. However, on the whole, those capital investments were necessary not only to build the middle class, but to enable the unparalleled industrial output that enabled us to win WWII.    "didn't even solve the depression" - A depression is a 10% or greater contraction in economic growth. When growth resumes, the depression is said to have ended. Growth resumed in the last quarter of 1933 - just as the first round of public-sector investments began, and just as we'd expect to find in a successful recovery program - and was then extremely strong until FDR foolishly tried to balance the budget in 1937.    "(17% unemployment in 1939)." - While still very high - though, when you crunch the current numbers in the same way in which unemployment calculated then, we're at about the same level right now - it merely speaks to the New Deal's timidity. The evaporation of unemployment with the implementation of "War Keynesianism" proves quite definitively that deficit spending/investment is the cure for deflationary depressions. You know, like the current one.|`|DNaMIcomaa	All right I will leave out WWII. But while FDR was resting from that he did in fact get Americans through the great depression,not only with aid and work programs, but with hope and encouragement,he built roads,bridges,tunnels,the Hoover Dam,he electrified rural America.Many of his policies are still in place today.He truly formed the face of modern America.You should thank GOD for FDR being the right man at the right place at the right time.Without him America may not have gotten through the crises that we faced. By the way 17% unemployment is much lower than the 25% that was recorded at the worst of the depression (some experts believe that it was as high as 33%.Since I can't use WWII I will instead cite "The Greatest Generation". Why were they so willing to sacrifice for this country in it's time of need? Could it be that they saw the great leadership of FDR and realized that this countries leadership cared for them that they were so willing? There was a reason that FDR was elected to four terms. The only reason for the sudden spurt of FDR bashing is that conservatism is starting to be exposed for the fraud that it is, and the great saint of conservatism Ronald Reagan and his crackpot economic policies are now generally accepted as the starting point of our current economic crises.|`|AA11586960	as far as a lot of people who know the truth yes he got the Almighty usa out of depression by making Great Britain pay for it Britain was not defending itself it was safe after 1940 FACT       But needed equipment to fight tyranny and the USA charged very high for what they offered and the UK paid of the Loans in 2003 after watching the Marchall plan rebuild Europe's Enemy's with money from lend lease     and don't forget the 700 million in gold for some pre war ships and after Midway when we loaned our Aircraft carriers to the USA they never offered to pay for the losses some friend      and FDR said he was the UK's friend in fact after WW2 Germany did more for the UK than FDR he made Pacts with Stalin behind Churchill's back    and don't forget Churchill was a true politician said all the right things to the right people at the right time like all good politicians do     I know i lived through it Hamburg was a great New City whilst the UK was still cleaning up the mess with friends like FDR who needs enemy's|`|4ojHnyZkaa	I do look at him this way, but he has an awful lot of competition for the dishonor now!|`|vNOkPdEMaa	no|`|V8hiG6Jfaa	Yes, because of his economic policies the depression lasted longer than a decade.|`|SS1VReF0aa	Depends on who you ask...best and worst is subjective.

The libs hate the cons and the cons hate the libs and neither one of them know that both of them are both of those things.

AA11494150	It is not unusual for officers to reduce the amount of the speed. However, he will put your actual speed in his incident report. If you contest the ticket, the judge will see you already got a break.    It is our prosecutor's policy when someone contests a ticket after they were given a break, he amends the ticket back to the original speed. This means if you are found guilty, you will be looking at a larger fine, and quite possible additional points.|`|eulMjLtPaa	LOL at Patrick's post.      He cut you a HUGE break, and saved you about $100 on your ticket fine.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	It's called giving you a break because 22 over the limit may cost you more than a fine. But like the other guy said if you want to fight it for the higher speed go ahead. The courts will appreciate the revenue and you will be on tv.|`|AA12109395	Sure, fight it. Tell the judge " your honor, I would like to contest the ticket because I was really going faster than what he wrote". Dude , pay the ticket!     Sorry, this was to good to resist.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	He is giving you a break. If he put the real speed you were going, the fine would be much higher.|`|c30166373f799ccf3b6182600c682717aa	He did you a big favor.  Pay the ticket.  You just saved a ton of money on your car insurance.  Seriously.    Don't speed and then you won't have this type of situation.  At least you got a speeding ticket instead of getting in an accident, possibly killing someone or yourself.|`|WL3KcegWaa	He gave you a break to lower the cost of the ticket for you.    So you go right ahead and explain to the judge that you want to fight the ticket because you were really going a lot faster than you were cited for.|`|415e1e8d6024188583945ee6cded5be6aa	Police officers often do this.  Going 47 in a 25 is Reckless Driving (Anything over 15 mph of the posted speed limit is R.D.)    Doubt you'll be able to fight it.  Look into taking a defensive driving course that may opt you out of the ticket's consequences.    If you do fight it, hope the cop doesn't show up - that'll be the only way out.  I'm sure the judge has heard "But, I really wasn't going that fast" 1000 times.|`|etjy9SYsaa	You are the reason I NEVER write a lower speed when I issue citations. Being nice just bites you in the pants.|`|d997b5ac6eed086c92a56500bdb74431aa	Let me get this straight.  You want to go before a judge and tell him/her that a cop said you were going 47 and then he gave you a ticket for you going 35?  And you want to fight that?    If I were a judge, I'd say, "Fine, pay the ticket for going 47...and by the way, your license is suspended for being over 20 mph over the limit."    Good thinking.  Run with that one.|`|emNCaAq7aa	Fight it all the way to the Supreme court. You deserve to get messed with.   Take the major break the officer gave you and say "thank you, sir" next time you have anything to do with a cop.|`|ec5e2cfdd5364a1a67d973613c5d9480aa	He gave you a break. Just pay the fine and don't drive so fast.    Always thank a police officer that does this, too.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	You were speeding and the officer did you a big favor.  Just thank him kindly and pay the ticket.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	He saved you from a Reckless Driving fine,   and you want to fight it even though you were given a break?       In court,  the officer is going to be asked how fast he clocked you at.    He will answer 47.   At that point,  the judge will be absolutely annoyed at your audacity,  given that you had a huge break handed to you and you didn't take it.    He could fine you the full cost of traveling at 47 (RD),  as well as court costs,  as well as in some jurisdictions,  you can be fined as well if the court determines your there "wasting their time".    Take your break and be happy.

367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	You probably would want to stay away from Sub service then. The berthing spaces (where you sleep) are pretty tight on the ship so that could be an issue. Go tour a WWII aircraft carrier to see if you could survive sleeping in a berthing space similar to that.|`|uurgL3oZaa	Have you seen where you sleep in the Navy? Look, if you've got claustrophobia issues, join the Army.|`|AFNgR9jTaa	Well as far as the Army I have had good and bad experiences with it. Just be careful with your MOS selection, don't always trust the videos of jobs that the recruiters show you, they are glamorized. I don't know about the Navy boot camp, I would suggest asking a recruiter. Make sure you see what both branches have to offer you.|`|neWbgaHCaa	It depends on how bad your claustrophobia is. When I went through the gas chamber there was a guy that couldn't put the mask on his face because of his claustrophobia. He didn't finish boot camp and got kicked out.

VZnCXMxYaa	Americans live in Disneyland, honestly. When many Americans claim they are poor, when they are actually obese. In Haiti people eat mud cakes to survive, that is real poverty. Americans believe that the world revolves around them, when in fact the only reasons they have an influence is due to the dollar being a reserve currency, once countries depeg (Gulf countries will depeg in 2010) the dollar has no support. The American economy is 70% consumer, so raises taxes will cause less consumption. It is a double-edged sword, which many are unprepared for.|`|Dj5f1SRfaa	If you are going to ask a rhetorical question then write a blog|`|fYgub7xraa	Because its true.

I saved money for years in spite of low interest rates, probably because I didn't know what else to do with it and nearly every time that I entered the market managed to loose something- owing to the high maintenance costs of mutual funds no matter if they failed or not, I believe, in addition to just plain bad luck. Clearly there was less and less reason to save inspired by our own spendthrift government. I suppose if you can print money and through complex and flawed financial instruments be allowed to print even more of it then why bother saving? I'm no economic whiz, I only know that 2 plus 2 equals four and certainly not 5 or even 10 or 100. If I were a foreign investor I wouldn't lend us a sufficient length of toilet paper- because, as it turns out, that is what our money is worth. They have invested in our economy because they had a surplus of funds, owing to our borrowing and spending habits and as a result reinvested further funds by them i order to keep us afloat during some crisis- what comes around usually goes around. With the new Bush debt and being so thoroughly insolvent we must now devalue our currency by way of printing far more of it than we are able to sustain via exports, interest on the deficit, collapsed housing market, mindless military costs, etc. Read this link- the government owns everything and can therefore devalue anything including all that we own. They may in addition demand all of our inflation hedging gold, and precious metals in a crisis, create a new form of currency and buy back our dollars for 2% on the dollar if they deem it necessary. This day of reckoning is guarantied if things continue to erode on such a spectacular scale far sooner than most of us may imagine. So, yes we are well and truly screwed. The extent of the fraud by our own government as well as the private sector is merely the tip of the iceberg, I fear and have always suspected.|`|UinOWcMUaa	It's the people in office who believe this non-sense, not the people !!

The people saying its unsustainable are trying to force government to not spend anything. Even IF the government decided to stop all spending then who is going to take care of roads, bridges, education, poverty issues and so on? There are so many things, thousands upon thousands that people rely on that government pays for.  Debt is sustainable by government. it always has been and always will be. If a foreign government decides to back out they lose out on everything the US offers them through the millions of programs we have going all around the globe. Our currency is all that keeps theirs going. Even China is almost totally dependent on the US economy. Without the US China's base would totally collapse and they would return to something akin to the cultural revolution and millions upon millions would starve.  Plus they would still have to contend with our military might.

They will make sure the taxes will be higher for the children and grandchildren.    They will realize the mess soon. The stock market down to 8000 on Dow is a start.     Someday China will decide that the US is a bad investment and will go elsewhere. They will continue buy Treasuries as long as the dollar is the currency for oil and we can continue to make the interest payment.    The massive manipulation of the markets, gold, oil is amazing. If this bailout/stimulus does not work we might just see hyper inflation soon.    The politicians do not care. They just want power. They think spending is the answer. It is the answer in a way. The fiat currency is debt driven. No debt, no money. Weird. Well, they just figure everything will be fine since the government is spending because consumer isn't right now.  China is the total opposite, they save like 30-50% of their income. Who's got it right?     It is sad that so many are living way beyond their means. The housing bubble caused some real pain. So many took 2nd and 3rd loans out on the inflated home prices. They bought huge houses that they could only afford with the low interest arm and interest only mortgages.    The answer is get prepared for the had working class to pay just a little more. It's your duty as Americans, right. After all, you are very fortunate. Lucky you can now pay more tax. This bailout mess will cost the taxpayers more. It's going to be hard to pay back the TRILLIONS for the war, bailout, stimulus in the next few years. Just have your kids do it. You gave them life, you gave them slavery. Thanks Mom & Dad!

He kept cutting spending, and cutting spending, and cutting spending; and then he just could not cut anymore and still the taxes weren't enough to cover his spending.

The reason, of course, is because of the car manufacturing crisis and the resulting financial problems of other businesses that depend on the car industry for their work (i.e., upholstery shops and parts manufacturers).  The government's handing over of money without regulation to the financial institutions (bail-out), and then demanding a dollar-for-dollar accounting from the car manufacturers (a loan), has caused a lot of friction and will likely result in even more plants being closed.  Our governor has stated that things will likely get much worse before we see any improvement, so it's a bleak picture for all of us.

What happened was that greedy opportunists abused the new system and compensated themselves with perks, salary and bonusses that bore no relationship to the loan risk.    WHAT IS OUTRAGEOUS IS THAT MUCH OF THIS CAME OUT OF THE 401(K) MONEY THAT SO MANY OF HAVE.

7ONKVbbiaa	if you look back on Palins initial appearance at the GOP convention, it was clear her entire "qualification" was attempts to smart mouth and demean the opposition.

It's the fact that she's just an Alaska girl that if put in a higher position such as governor she'd be ridiculed because she's innocent and has different ideas then most neoconservatives.  She has gotten more things thrown at her then she deserved because she was just a small figure in politics.  I'd rather see her in office then Hillary Clinton any day because the Clinton's are about as messed up as the Kennedy's as far as I'm concerned.  Palin is younger and less of a figurehead and democrats love to bring her down because of it.|`|b22d8ccedb447bfcc30483c3590f81f3aa	Same reason Obamamanics say the same exact same thing about anyone who criticizes Hussein.|`|hf9fsmHxaa	I think most lefties would hate a black man if he disagreed with their agenda.

But, then again, my black girlfriend has been called a race traitor for the same reasons.  The Obama cultists know no shame.    I have seen little in terms of criticism of Mrs. Palin, but a LOT of attacks on her family and personal attacks against her that have nothing to do with criticism or politics.|`|H6ZGYmsyaa	You conservatives are just plain stupid, I hope Palin runs in 2012, Sarah Palin is so dumb and so stupid we could run ROD BLAGOJEVECH against her and WIN!|`|xoK87yuGaa	Most Dems really want her to run in 2012, we want another 4 years!

Most of the time, fear is the direct result of ignorance.  People fear what they don't understand.  Therefore, when liberals dis Palin and yet show no knowledge of her accomplishments or respect for same, it shows their ignorance and thus, their fear of her.    The "criticisms" you speak of by the liberals against Palin are usually done with little or no reference to either truth or fact.|`|Zp93fab3aa	I agree Dora, they are mistaking the disambiguation.

Qou0CLwiaa	> When I ask why it keeps being postponed, they give me some round about answer.    You are a witness, no more. You have no standing to know the details of the prosecution case.    But in general, it may be that he does not have enough evidence to convict, and since the guy is already in prison for 2 murders, he is not going anywhere, and there is no rush to build a sloppy case that will lose in court.    Or it may be that the guy is trying to get a plea bargain from the DA - guys involved in at least 3 murders are often involved in other nefarious stuff, and may be able to provide info on other crimes in exchange  for leniency on the 3rd charge. This can take a very long time to extract and verify before such a deal is reached. Again, since the guy is not going anywhere, there is no real rush just to keep witnesses happy.    One thing I would ask you - you clearly suffered major psychological trauma, and continue to suffer. What are you doing to take care of yourself? You should look into treatment for PTSD and other issues....|`|AA10240928	In a nutshell, they're not ready to go to trial.

AA11163314	Sadly, the people of California did this to themselves.  Remember all of those propositions we keep voting for every two years?  What we have done is created mandatory spending that cannot be touched or reduced in lean times.    There are so many amendments to the California Constitution that it is impossible to vote to have them all repealed.  (And too many special interest groups would fight it tooth and nail.)    At this point what we need is the same thing the Iraqi people did.  Hold a special election to select a group of people who will write a new state Constitution then submit it to the voters in a statewide referendum.    And in order to force the legislature to do their jobs - require a 2/3 majority before any new proposition can be passed.|`|S6AjZ2uMaa	Venting, ranting or using hate speech  Yahoo!

tHKRgH8Baa	For starters, congratulations and thank you for serving.   1. The DEP program just allows you time to get your affairs in order while the Navy finds class dates for your training. It can last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. I think I spent about 5 months waiting on my class dates. (I was a little picky about the jobs that I chose)  2. Your family will be just fine. The military really has made some big strides in taking care of troops families. You will obviously be on your own while at boot camp but they will be able to attend your graduation and you will most likely be able to spend some personal time with them after graduation. (I joined the Air Force but I'm assuming the process is similar) When you get to your "A" school, you'll be living in the baracks with everyone else but as soon as you get to your first permanent duty station, you can have them come to live with you. Depending on whether or not you are assigned to a ship or shore duty, you can sleep at home every night. A ship, not so much for obvious reasons. Again, thanks for serving and congratulations. Just remember why you joined in the 1st place, too many people forget after they have been in for a few years.

U0jcpSUlaa	It is really a tough one, because on one hand you don't want crazies out there to have their hands on guns like the AK47 that can be so dangerous in the wrong hands.    When I stand up for the second amendment, I stand up for my right to own a gun to hunt for food, and to protect myself if necessary, although my 20 Gage probably would not do much against someone close range with a hand gun or further away with a rifle.  Then I think about what was going through our founding fathers' heads when they were writing the bill of rights.  They had been oppressed by a monarch for centuries, and did not want that kind of oppression to happen in the United States.  So they made a list of rights to protect the people from the government becoming too strong or tyrannical.  The only amendment which allows the people to protect all of the others is the second amendment.    The government is of the people for the people and by the people, and the people should always have the power.  Some people don't notice our rights being taken away slowly, but it happens.  Sometimes it's for our protection, other times it's because politicians think they know better than us.    I am not against the government.  I love the government, although I do not always agree with what they do.  I wish the government was a lot smaller and tried to exert less control over the citizens and let them simply live their lives with less interference.  I firmly believe that each and every one of us knows better what we want than the government does.      And Ben Franklin along with the other founding fathers knew that when a government becomes tyrannical, it has to be changed, and sometimes by force.  This seems to be a far off concept here in the USA, but there are places in the world where it is more apparent like Sudan or Rwanda.  If the people had weapons besides sticks and stones to fight back against the tragic events going on there, they would at least have freedom to fight for their lives.    If I was ever the president, I would want the people to have guns.  I would want them to have guns that could change the government if it became tyrannical, and I would think long and hard before I made a decision.  Happily we have not had such a government in the past 233 years, and we have a constitution which uses checks and balances to help prevent it.  That said, it is always the rights of the citizens to protect their freedom, and we cannot protect our freedom with sticks and stones, and god forbid we ever had to fight any military forces, we would not be able to fight without real weapons like the AK47.    Pelosi and Obama know that assault rifles do not cause many deaths in the United States.  They also know that if there were no guns, people would kill eachother with baseball bats and knives.  They also know that their supporters are of the opposite thinking as I am for the most part. They will go wild for any politician that takes a gun out of the hands of a citizen.  Their supporters do not generally use or own guns, and think that 1. guns are owned by rednecks and people in gangs, 2. if there are assault rifles in the hands of the public, they will eventually use them to kill (and they are not 100% wrong about that, though like you said it is not often, and those people would kill anyway, just not as many probably) and 3.  (which is the part where they are very wrong in my opinion) that if we take guns from citizens, crime will decrease and we will be safer.  The AK47 is a good target for politicians because they are made for killing people, and besides shooting at a target, they aren't much good for anything else.  They know very well that it is hard to have these guns, and they are not military issue specs, and they are not the cause of many crimes.  They pick an easy target that they know their voting base, which are the people they count on to not know this information, will go for.|`|fYKrqEBJaa	They know very well what they're doing. The first step to banning guns completely is to start picking and choosing certain guns to ban. Then it's just a matter of slowly adding every gun and form of ammunition to the list.    The slippery slope is real.    .|`|fHTvjaYtaa	You answered your own question:  They don't have any common knowledge.      Both have shown that everyday.|`|m3Igki7qaa	Yes. Obama and Pelosi don't let facts get in the way of their anti-American socialist agenda.  They hate the Constitution and don't mind denying the citizens their Constitutional rights.|`|lwV0M4ftaa	Maybe we should require that all American citizens carry any type of gun they want at all times.  This would certainly end discipline problems in the school system, and it would make fights in bars more exciting.|`|7vPiH3gzaa	You let me know where and how a 14 year old black kid from the south side of Chicago gets a special class 3 license after he had shot up his school using an ak47 3 months ago.    Then I will believe you.    You let me know how the illegal drug lords alien mexicans are using the "real" ak47 on our minutemen on the boarders of Texas and California to get their drugs inside the US after shooting up our God loving citizens trying to protect our boarders.    Then I will believe you.    Obama is wrong, Pelosi is wrong, and so are you.  Anything, and everything can be bought on the black markets.      So, every God Loving American should have right and It is in our constitution, to have arms to protect ourselves from the enemy.  Which in now-times may include our own neighbors.    You Tell ME!!????    TO Ray:  You see Ray, even "Aives" is poking fun at the situation.  You can buy anything on the black market.  My $100.00US "Ed Hardy" t-shirt is going for $25US or less online from a Chinese market.  Lord knows how much less a screwball can pay online for real assult weapons.    To Phil:  I totally understand what you are talking about, but look at that Korean kid who was attending Virginia Tech who killed 33, or the Vietnamese one who planned and killed at the US immigration office.    One was a wacko, and the other was fed-up.    Maybe we should leave the guns alone and just put a huge price on amunition.    Huh.....like only military and law enforcement will have special coded ammunition.    For the public you will be issued specially coded ammunition -  "like hunters" have special numbers and you have to proove the ammunition matches your weapon, plus it will be regularly priced as there are now; so when a person is shot and/or shot or killed, officials can tell if the bullets came from law enforcement, hunters, or people who got the bullets just for killing (protection).    but if you need the bullets for killing people, then maybe it should be specially coded and cost oh....about $1,000.00 a bullet....that will make you think twice about killing someone....  You will be refunded your bullet money for a justified killing proven in court.    but then again...we have the forever "Black Market".....    Darn... it would have been a good idea....    Or maybe the military should get out those new laser guns they have stored and put them on the market, and show the public that one shot, (just like in Star Trek), you will evaporate....that would lower your crime.....don't you think?|`|QVjvBgT5aa	" rel="nofollow">HTTP://WWW.stylishdudes.com>  We are wholesaler of Nike Jordan and Other Shoes in China.

It's a really simple process that even a high school dropout can do.     My biggest problem with the right to bear arms is every retard out there thinks they're dirty harry, when most of them can't even hit a target at 20 yards. I've known many young men who thought it was cool to get a 9mm and carry it around tucked in their pants, "just in case".

O5OVMi3caa	first call and ask your local flight school or airport(about if they have helicopter lessons), then you would have to get your private helicopter license from your local flight school, then try and get hours and ratings for your piloting, once you get enough hours and the right ratings and license type you would have to do training for the fire department, to do that i also would ask your flight instructor how to go about this. also if you go for it, try looking into king schools of aviation, this will help you through some, http://www.kingschools.com/searchResults...  home page --> http://www.kingschools.com/  also you may find some help at http://www.sportys.com/ .  And one tip is if you do flight training, remain professional and show you can and give a good impression, flight training is like one big job interview and a big test, you have to show to your instructor that you are o.k. dont worry about it though, instructors are people and understand, once you go for your first ride or lesson, you will get a feel for it. (to go with what i said, to be a professional pilot you first have to be a private pilot and then build up hours then get new ratings and ultimatly upgrade from private pilot to a professional pilot, then you can do it for a living)   P.S. most small private or public airports give lessons.

"We the people of the US, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the U.S. of A."     -Preamble to the Constitution    Providing a stimulus plan to keep our country from slipping into another Great Depression is not an act of Socialism.

It's quite possible that, eliminating the total vote fraud count, Obama still would have edged out over McCain---but that doesn't excuse the pro-Obama voter fraud that was committed.    And such voter fraud IS a felony crime---and we should go after as many fraudulent voters and jail them AND ACORN staffers behind such.  However, Obama I'm sure has people quietly scrambling to cover up the evidence; he's snugly confident such discoveries won't be made anytime soon.    IF, however, such evidence of voter fraud DOES show up soon, expect Obama to vehemently deny involvement---unless the coveted "smoking gun" is also found with that evidence.     Bottom line: Pro-Obama voter fraud IS there, be it discovered soon or later. Given: Obama's NO saint---so the REAL question(s) are: "What else is Obama covering up"????

I would spend it helping all Americans not just the tax breaks for the companies and the wealthy.       n a press conference this morning, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) discussed his objections to President Obamas stimulus package currently before the Senate. McConnell expressed his concerns over the long term cost of the plan, because we are already looking at, before we even do this, at over a trillion dollar deficit for this year:    Most of my members believe that we could pass a very robust stimulus for less than the amount currently before us. We have been throwing figures around like it was paper money. We are already looking at, before we even do this, at over a trillion dollar deficit for this year. We all agree that we need to do something, but I dont think we should not just completely act like the amount is irrelevant.    McConnell is not alone in trotting out this argument. Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) has also railed against increasing the deficit to pay for measures that wont act as effective economic stimulus, saying that the current stimulus plan is arrogantly indifferent to economic reality.    The only comprehensive alternative being offered by Senate conservatives is DeMints American Option: A Jobs Plan That Works, a series of permanent tax breaks for corporations and wealthy Americans. A new analysis from the Center for American Progress Action Fund finds that the DeMint plan would cost over $3.1 trillion over ten years  more than three times the amount of President Barack Obamas plan  and be largely ineffective at creating jobs.|`|RermzbWgaa	I wouldn't spend any of it.|`|4woDH5Inaa	I'm not an economist, but I know that the Repubs would just put it all on tax cuts for the rich.|`|4b80ad61535bb068018848986ceeb142aa	i would not. i would keep it in the bank for interest :)|`|G49lKR56aa	I'd buy me some new underwear!

Giving themselves absolute power, bringing slavery to all.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Not even close.        Obamanomics, as you like to put it, understands that the confidence level in both the government and the economy is central to keeping the economy growing.    The benefit of the bill is not in spending, and in fact the spending is going way down if Republicans play the part they are supposed to play.  The idea is to increase confidence in the Democrats for stepping up and realizing the need for action, then to increase confidence in Republicans for realizing the need for restraint, then increase overall confidence in us when we see that the government leaders can work together to come up with a bill that can work.    Problem is that Republicans are not playing their part.  A huge part of that is Nancy Pelosi, who got screwed when Republicans were in office and now intends to screw them right back.  But instead of doing the right thing, Republicans are just throwing a temper tantrum and refusing to work and only complain.  Now the whole thing is screwed.        The idea was that the Democrats put forth a bill that shows they see the seriousness of the situation.  They have certain additions to the bill that are supposed to be taken out by the Republicans.  But instead of taking out those amendments, Republicans wanted to ADD to it.      Notice that when Republicans say something about parts of the bill needing to be taken out, they are taken out.  What is not being allowed is their adding to the bill.  That is because they aren't supposed to add to the bill, that isn't the role Obama is pushing for them and one they shouldn't be playing anyway.  They are supposed to restrain this thing, not add to it.    If they did their part, they would pull parts of the bill out of it, and Democrats and Republicans would then get a bipartisan bill that would get nearly the full support of Congress.  Then Obama signs it into law, and both sides look good when they did their part.  That increases our confidence that the government finally knows what its doing, that they can play games but know when its time to stop playing, and that they realize the situation and have gotten serious.    Then with our confidence increased, customers are more likely to spend, investors more likely to invest, and businesses more likely to hire.  The idea is not to spend, but to increase confidence.  Then we fix the situation.    Now we just need Nancy Pelosi and the Republicans to pull their sh*t together and do precisely what was expected of them, instead of this bullsh*t where they keep shooting themselves in the foot to hurt the other side.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	Isnt obamanomics wonderful.

di43MlSFaa	The banks in my opinion are just as guilty in abusing the funds given to them as the finance firms for giving large bonuses and doing remodeling projects with funds given to them.  The banks held onto the funds given them, bought out or merged with other banks, didn't lend and have now tightened the lending process even further, while having extravagant spending.  Add to that, they've been hiring people from outside of the country to come here on work visa's and using workers here on H 1B visas in order to save money by not having to pay high wages to US citizens. At the bottom of the linked article below, it even states one bank sent work overseas to India.   The bail out of banks has already proven to be a dismal failure. In the long run I can see it costing the 'whole' (citizens) a lot more by not being able to borrow, purchase homes, cars etc. Never mind they weren't hiring all US citizens to work for them and many thousands lost their jobs when banks starting going down. The numbers of visa's are not large, but it's the point of it all. Anything to save a 'buck'. One would think they've saved quite a bundle at this point if they can pay out for the extravagant extra spending.     "Beyond seeking approval for visas from the government, banks that accepted federal bailout money also enlisted uncounted foreign workers, often in technology jobs, through intermediary companies known as "body shops." Such businesses are the top recipients of the H-1B visas".    http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090202/ap_o...    Edit: Just in the news today.

Furthermore I must stress very very strongly that this giving of money is NOT a Republican effort, but instead a Democratic effort when started and OK'ed (stupidly) by a republican president and then blown out of control by a communistic new president! Don't ever ever think that conservative ideas support "bailing out" private institutions.

6CfYiabAaa	I am married to a soldier who has been through 4 deployments! lol. I have also seen my SIL go through being in love with her husband and him going to the army and he was shipped to korea. He has not seen their little girl and he has let korea completely destroy him. Being a spouse is the hardest job in the world. You not only have to worry about your issues but running a whole household with kids ( if any) while worrying about your soldier and trying to be there for him IF he reaches out to you. My hubby is now in a rehab for PTSD. You will need a lot of strengh, trust and commitment to be a military spouse. It is very rewarding. We always say when we hear someone saying they would not marry a soldier...we say thats ok...think to yourself you are stronger than her anyways! You never know how strong you are till being strong is the only choice you have. I have seen a lot of great men turn badly because they were unable to tell the difference and seperate family and military! Good Luck|`|EM2Mn98Qaa	There are a lot of successful military marriages, but you need to work on it.  When your spouse is away, you will have to rely on friends, family, and other spouses from the unit for companionship and support.    I know in many units the CO's spouse will help to coordinate things for families at home, so make sure you look into and take advantage of anything that is offered.|`|AA11401709	Being a soldier's wife is similar to any other wife in any profession. It is a little bit harder, that's a fact but only because he'll be away for extended amounts of time depending on the training, deployment, etc.    A soldier is worth waiting for and marrying. That's what I believe in.
AA11401709	It depends a lot on the situation on the ground. Please keep in mind that the Marines' task is basically ground operations. Do you think there will be more ground operation in Afghanistan? I think the answer is no. There will be training and logistics but you can't invade the same country twice when you are still on its soil.    You still have so much time to think about that and you can see the situation as it changes and make up your mind in few years! no rush, best of luck.
r2JPcUN8aa	It had nothing to do with the campaign and had everything to do with the way the Kennedy's entertained.  The long rectangle tables at State dinners were put aside for round tables that sat 10 or 12, making conversation easier and thus more interesting.  His was also the first Presidency to get rid of the white dinner jacket.
bkav003oaa	The average "liberal" uses other forms of media such as television and the Internet and is more comfortable with those forms of media.|`|AA12191521	Liberals would rather be entertained than informed.

People who listen to conservative talk radio believe in something and people who listen to liberal talk believe in anything.|`|uxu8qJUYaa	Liberal talk radio is 90% emotional appeal, it can only be regurgitated so much before the average listener says, "Okay, they have repeated this 10 times in the last 15 minutes" and then changes the station.  There isn't enough fact, stats or intellectual information for a conservative or a moderate to want to take in and debate.  On the other hand, you have the reverse on Moderate or Conservative talk radio.  Moderates and Liberals will stay tuned to debate or be challenged by the information.    For the base listener of either side, Conservatives are stimulated by information while Liberals are stimulated by emotions.|`|K4VZtIr3aa	We Liberals smoke pot...so our attention span is very short|`|sOaqLLS6aa	because they suck, and liberals know it.|`|V8sDPf2Eaa	talk radio listeners are more logical and liberals are anything but. liberals have the attention span of a fruit fly so they cant process big thoughts|`|GHusBLjgaa	Oh man this would take forever to answer completely but I will nail only a few key points:  1) It is a flat out lie, most people do not like being lied to all the time  2) It does not have Keith Olberman so liberals do not have there man hate filled little man shouting off propaganda  3) Lets face it welfare covers only so much. When you refuse to work and can only have a tv or a radio which would you have?  4) Lets face Glenn Beck is the man, liberals have nobody who can come close to his emotions, his talking points or intellect to put on the radio so instead they shout for the fairness doctrine because in their minds the 1st Amendment is overrated.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Because they don't tell the truth. and people know it.|`|HGIuXxnRaa	Because people dont like to listen to hypocrites.|`|DLvHWOo7aa	It's like watching CSPAN, no bias, no bull, no hate to fuel you.

They just rant and whine.|`|faVSsLGAaa	Its demoralizing.  Nothing is ever good with them, its a constant stream of life sucks,someone's cheating you, you need government to have any hope of anything...    Who wants to listen to that?|`|oMAXAQA0aa	The only way to have a liberal point of view is to not be contested. Liberal talk shows could not follow the same format as conservative talk shows. For example, if someone who disagrees with Rush winds up lucky enough to speak to him on the air, all of his questions will be answered. They may not be the answers the caller was expecting to hear, but they will be answered.   This is one of the reasons why conservative talk shows are the only talk shows that are able to change someones point of view. (being in the center and going to the left or right doesn't count).  Someone calling a liberal talk show with an opposing view would simply be talked over, with none of their questions addressed. It is very frustrating to listen to, even for the people who agree with the host's viewpoint.|`|65jQutxUaa	Would you want to listen to hours of "America Sucks"  "It's all Bush's fault"  "Reagan was the Devil"  "You will have no future"  "Life sucks" ??    Conservative radio, by and large, is positive and has an element of humor to it.|`|C3gaC24Iaa	No one wants to waste time listening to libs whine, and preach extreme PC ideas.|`|iqGY5jvfaa	the funny thing is...you have libs that listen to Conservative Talk Radio..    they like Sean Hannity..and Rush...    they don't admit it...|`|AA10725001	people aren't that big of fools!|`|iGYGJfgsaa	Because they dont tell fart jokes and talk about sports.

In the macro sense, consider the election results: The final popular vote numbers show that he only received 52.9% to McCain's 45.7% popular vote.  That means that roughly 60 Million Americans did not want this guy to be president.    In a micro sense, I can attest that I have many family and friends who, contrary to what's being reported or displayed via CNN and ABC, are extremely worried about where this country is headed with Obama.  The common opinions are that he is at best inexperienced and naive and at worst manipulative, arrogant, and full of @ $@ .    If you doubt this, flip over to FOX news for a few minutes.  Here you will see that there is a LARGE segment of the population that doesn't buy what Obama is selling.|`|oTqZm4NFaa	Fantastic.. great for you!|`|wULUGKzVaa	No, not everyone loves Obama.

What motivated me was getting ram rodded through the court system for something I didn't even do.  I would say my civic duty is only getting started, I've written letters to just about every local politician I can think of, gone to cracker barrel meetings, and town hall meetings, the only one who's responded was a US Senator, and that was just to say it was a local issue take it up with the Governor.

For instance, destabilization. Sometimes it's better to oust a government then try and fix it. Such as the government in the Congo. It would be a good idea if countries were to get together and force out those criminals. There are world organizations, but they don't have military might. So going to war is not always a bad thing. It can be a humanitarian thing to do. But it doesn't happen for that reason often. There is destableization for security reasons too.

I think though, they should be obliged to sign, agreeing to return to their home country once things get better. (which should be a monitored process) - But until it gets better, they should have access to education and jobs, but no welfare benefits. (This isn't racist, providing that I don't even think white people should have them either, unless they're literally unable to work)    What annoys me about some "asylum seekers", is that they pass through Germany, France, Belgium and wherever else, which are First-World countries and then try to claim asylum in England. I don't care if they're genuine at this point, because they've passed through safe countries already.. but why didn't they stop in them? They obviously target England for one reason or another, but I don't think they're that desperate if they manage this.    I have no problems with immigrants in this country, but I don't think falsely claiming asylum is fair on genuine asylum seekers which sometimes get rejected, and would-be-otherwise immigrants, who are blockaded with all sorts of legal issues getting into the country. Visas, work permits, qualification recognition etc.|`|JgNjdsqOaa	I do. My country was ruled by the communists for 42 years with all the consequences. When 19 years old I was able to escape and became so a refugee. Coming to a democratic country I filled an application for political asylum, which was granted. After 28 years of living abroad I returned home. The commies were gone - ousted by the historical events. Therefore asylum seekers are refugees are the same. Asylum could be granted if a person is persecuted for political, religious or ethnic reasons - this according to international treaties.   PS. Those dummies (first three answers) were just lucky to be born in a free country without even contributing to it. Consuming only, they are lacking an education. My country was also free once and is now again.

3916f5798ac025038c4fefc3c8b7ea7caa	I despise the Clintons, and sure wish they'd vanish into obscurity.  But I do think this was a very smart move by President Obama.  (Ala the old "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer" trick.)  The biggest thing it does is give Hillary a stake in whether Obama's presidency is successful or not.  That way he knows she won't be actively working AGAINST him.      And make no mistake, she would DEFINITELY have done everything she could (without being caught at it) to see that Obama failed.  Then she could have claimed that SHE would have been a better choice.     I would LOVE to see a law passed that no other Bush or Clinton could ever be elected President.  The country would definitely be better for it...|`|Oh9oFiriaa	no|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Uh... nobody elected Hillary Clinton for Secretary of State.|`|tktpraYVaa	**** no  its just another big problem  in our future we have to   deal with|`|RqQDKEVHaa	She wasn't elected Secretary of State.

I wouldn't have done it.|`|AA11163314	It was a smart decision politically because it neutralized a rival.    It was not a smart decision for the nation because she is already undoing Powell's reforms.  Powell restructured the State Department so that career diplomats had input into the foreign policy process instead of having to try to implement what a bunch of political appointees wanted.  In addition Powell purged the State Department of partisan politics.      Look at it this way - despite Blackwater being cleared of wrongdoing after being accused of committing a massacre, Hillary canceled their contract.  As a result Blackwater is pulling out with their top talent and leaving the amateurs with guns take over the State Department Contract.

Where are the fathers?|`|jKmbJyxJaa	Everyone tells kids not to have sex. But they still DO. Every single person I know had sex before they finished high school.    So, someone has to teach them to get condoms or other forms of birth control in case of the inevitable. They are not born knowing these things. We also need to make it much more accessible and affordable since they usually don't have lots of money and may be embarrassed or afraid of their parents finding out.    And it's not just STDs and pregnancy in and of itself they need to learn about. It's the unintended social and financial consequences as well. Most young people feel invincible and they will need to be told (and shown examples) many times before they truly understand.|`|0nsfvY48aa	O.K. Here is your education. Don't have sex.

teKeLxX2aa	Wow, I love it how people can answer questions they know absolutely nothing about.    In the Reserves you only need to report one weekend a month and do two weeks of duty a year. You can be called for deployment, in which case you are given a certain amount of time to get ready for the transition to active duty. While you are on reserve status, you can live anywhere you want, your only requirement is to report to duty during your drill weekend (8 hours a day, for Saturday and Sunday).    While on Active Duty, that is your job and you do whatever hours you are given wherever you are stationed or deployed to. Most people on Active Duty get time off once a week, which is called Liberty. Normally your allowed to take two weeks off once a year, which is called Leave.|`|F7E9WPd5aa	In the Navy and the reserves, you go through the same basic training.     The Navy is full time where you live and do everything where they station you (on base)...     and the reserves you would serve like 2 weekends a month, and you live in your own apartment (off the base), etc and couple weekends a year (don't remember how much)    At least it is like that in the Army and its reserves.|`|GIlTkQu6aa	hey hows it going.  whenever you here reserve after a military branch it mens that you dont have to stay on duty. if they need you they ill call you and talk in code such as "the geese are migrating south on tuesday" once you here that call you are called in.
cOJyoXEhaa	Read the Contra files it explains alot. Thank you Al Gore.|`|BUCvr0R8aa	Well here's how it goes.  Bush hated Sadam Husein because he tried to kill his father.  Holding a huge grudge Bush begins to try to find a reason to attack Iraq.  Weapons of mass destruction.  Bush pulls it straight out of his ***.  When they get over there there's no weapons of mass destruction.  So to keep Bush and his administration from looking like a bunch of dumbasses he singles out Iraq.  Even though there's other dictators that are just as bad and evil.  Like Iran and this guy has nuclear weapons and North Korea and even though there's other countries with just as many terrorist.  Your dumbass president says we need this war and singles out Iraq like it's the only country in the world.  What we've gained 30,000 dead soldiers,  millions of Iraqi people who could care less and want their old ruler back to beat the hell out of them and torcher them and another gain of billions upon billions of dollars shot to hell.  So there you have it.

083d6fafca78da36d20de847faf89803aa	Thank you for your interest in serving.  In general....    1.  The Marines are "light" Infantry.  They have a tradition of excelling in small unit tactics.  They are very big into amphibious operations.  The Army is more into large unit operations, and playing with "cutting" edge technology.    2.  The Army over the past several years have had a Public Relations Problem.  This may be mostly undeserved, but may have risen from the deployment tempo of the Reserves/National Guard.    3.  The (US) Air Force, Navy, Army, and Coast Guard, all have employment opportunities for physicians.  The exact process for signing up will depend slightly upon how you go about it, and which service you are talking about but in general...    1.  Get a Undergraduate (BA/BS) degree.  2.  Go to Medical School.  3.  Join the service of your choice.    ...Good luck....|`|2zhQznahaa	And a good sum of the medical recruiters are in Virginia i believe.  But, some of the Navy people doing their 3rd year of residence, and learning still in college : wear active duty clothes and do rotations, because they are either on scholarship, or what you call ROTC.     If you enlisted first, or had a husband that did 6-10 years, you could take advantage of the MGBill, and go to some medical school on the MGIBill.    It is tough, and you have to take out tremendus student loans to get through pre-med school, then med school.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	There are no Marine doctors, the Navy provides madical services for the Marine Corps.    To be a military doctor, you have to have graduated from medical school.    Then you contact a medical recruiter.    The military is not going to enlist you, then put you thru school to be a doctor.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	What you need is a college education, then 4 years of Medical school and then 3 years as an intern, then join the Army as a doctor!|`|99ea9ef1d3ccadf76a367bfdcafd8593aa	All the services except the USMC which relies on the USN for medical service have physicians and they get taken care of pretty well. The services do their best to retain their docs and reward them with nice bonus money. On top of that you do not need to provide Your own office, support staff or insurance that must be worth a lot of money. There are a number of options to you but it might be easiest to get your MD/DO and go from there.
ABmZYbDZaa	First what branch are you talking about?     In general yes, they can have you wait that long before you go to BCT/boot camp. Going to basic/boot camp and being deployed at two totally DIFFERENT things. As for time after initial training and reporting to your duty station.... It really depends on where you are going and can vary from person to person. Some have 3 days and others have 30.      Best suggestion is that if you are wanting to make a trip overseas do it BEFORE trying to enlist.|`|d24ed2b7d94d561e4d3cf6271cc4bdb8aa	It depends on what job you choose in the military and when you are scheduled to leave.  If you are going Air force or Navy you will have to wait longer to go to basic training than Army and Marine recruits do.  If you choose to be a cook or MP in the Air Force you would leave earlier.  You find out when you leave when you choose your job.  As for being deployed when you get out, they usually tell you around a year before you will be deployed.

They will be able to explain what needs to be done, and if it changes the fine.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Go to court and contest the ticket.  There will be video and other records proving where you were when you were pulled over.  If the area you were in was actually 60mph you can at the very least get the fine lessened, if not dropped due to poor police work.

xWSIIOpaaa	You should first check whether your ex-husband had kept his Italian citizenship or not. Only when you're sure of this your children could eventually claim their Italian citizenship.    For you it should be different, as you aren't married with him anymore. You should have applied after your 3rd wedding anniversary, but now I am afraid it could be too late.    You will be however entitled to work and live in Italy as parent of an underage Italian citizen anyway, and apply for naturalization later.|`|a66nvk0taa	1) Your father was an Italian citizen at the time of your birth and you never renounced your right to Italian citizenship.      2) Your mother was an Italian citizen at the time of your birth, you were born after January 1st, 1948 and you never renounced your right to Italian citizenship.      3) Your father was born in your native country, your paternal grandfather was an Italian citizen at the time of your father's birth, neither you nor your father ever renounced your right to Italian citizenship.       4) Your mother was born in your native country, your maternal grandfather was an Italian citizen at the time of her birth, you were born after January 1, 1948 and neither you nor your mother ever renounced your right to Italian citizenship.       5) Your paternal or maternal grandfather was born in your native country, your paternal great grandfather was an Italian citizen at the time of his birth, neither you nor your father nor your grandfather ever renounced your right to Italian citizenship     NOTE: A woman born before 01/01/1948 can claim the Italian citizenship only from her father and can transfer it to descendants after 01/01/1948).     NOTE: "Italian citizen at the time of birth" means that he/she did not acquire any other citizenship through naturalization, before the descendant's birth|`|AA11966821	"Third generation Italian?"  Do you mean his great-grandparents immigrated to the US & he was the third US-born generation?  No way to get Italian citizenship for his kids.    Or was he an Italian citizen at the time his kids were born?  Did he register their births and get them Italian passports?  If he was an Italian citizen, he can probably still get them Italian citizenship.    If the children's grandparent was an Italian citizen, they might be able to claim Italian citizenship.  But not a great-grandparent.    You are not married to him anymore and therefore have no claim to Italian citizenship.  He would have had to apply for your immigration while you were married.  Your children, if they have a right to Italian citizenship, do not confer citizenship on a parent.  Parents confer citizenship as a birthright on their children.|`|AA12027560	You must receive resident card from Italy through your children who're qualified to be  Italian citizens and you must spend some years in Italy as a resident in order to apply 4 Italian citizenship & you'll not be able to receive it unless you're actually living legally in Italy and after meeting certain conditions & then you might apply 4 it.  http://www.italiandualcitizenship.com/.    http://www.italiandualcitizenship.com/id...

l2MjVVpRaa	Being a swat leader isn't something that you can just 'become'.    You'll first have to get an education far above your current limited communications skills.    You'll then have to apply and compete against hundreds of other qualified applicants.    Then, if you are one of the 20 applicants out of 1000 who get selected for employment, you'll have to complete your FTO program successfully after your 6 month to 1 year academy.    After 4-6 years as a street officer, you'll again have to compete against other qualified officers to become a member of swat. After many, many hours of training and in-house competition, you'll be allowed to go on your first SWAT call out.     You'll be critiqued for your actions or in-actions. You'll be re-trained and start the cycle all over again.    After 5-10 years as a successful SWAT team member, you'll have to compete against other members for the leadership position.    If you end up being a swat leader, you'll be one of several thousand officers who wanted the position.    Not unattainable, but very slim chances.    But, good luck in your career choice.    After 34 years in the business, I still love going to work every day.|`|IYu3bBFqaa	I suggest you improve your speaking and typing skills before pursuing either.|`|ec6d6526154860f9cab361f34526d848aa	Neither would ever get you to that position - how about trying what everyone else does - here you go.    Work a beat - work hard and make great arrests - do it for years.    be very proficient at firearms - you may get on a SWAT team as a peon and work your way to the perimeter team and then maybe a sniper and then maybe an entry person.      Work your way up to a high rank in the police department - regular officers will never lead a tactical team - or at least coordinate one.    Learn tactical command - study case law - know what you can and should do legally when confronted with a situation - this all takes many years.    You will never do that out of the military or college - most of my colleagues have been on the job 15 or more years and hold high rank in order to do this.

You have to find 2 new ones, and then you have to write a big speech explaining how horrible those people are, which will lose a bunch of supporters, especially after how much he praised them previously. That speech almost always comes with a drop in approval ratings. I think Obama secretly wanted them to step down, but he didn't say anything in an attempt to keep his approval rating, although it would really go down either way. After all, his approval rating is only three times as high as the previous president!|`|afcd7d949de4a5073f2fc8e97bc1bdcfaa	He's typical of any other Chicago politician and his poor leadership skills are starting to show. He's already showing that his word is no good.  There nothing new about Obama except he's a far left liberal who has a Socialist agenda.|`|mvgfatSNaa	No.  Obama is much more than that.  I have no doubt that if he wanted to focus on coruption he would be better than anybody at at it.  But he is leaving that up to Rom Immanual, Blogovich and the Illinois people.    Remember, Obama is Hope and Change!!!  You cant have the change without hope and the hope without the change.  You dont need a plan if you got these two elements working for you.

The Republicans caused this mess and now the Democrats like her are instantly solving it.

Reuben had some ethics conflicts and Nancy had to destant her from him...Well, turn out that Nany and reuben are really doing it to save her butt...  There is some much scandel too early on in the Obama cabinet and associates that it makes the bush years seem like a walk in the park... Can't wait to see Richaardson get out of the company he was partners in transporting illegals up north with false papers and avoiding paying taxes on hsi company gains...

AA10667591	When a party becomes divided into 2 general fields of opinion or idealogy that challenges the staus quo|`|6nS62bB8aa	Well, polarization is the splitting of a single whole into two separate, and opposite, parts. In this case, a group of people.    Whereas you could define the group as a single whole, something has caused those people to divide themselves into two separate groups. So while the original group remains, it is divided within itself.    Sort of like a tray of ice cubes. Are you looking at a tray of ice cubes, or several individual cubes which are only related by the fact of being stuck in the same tray?

They do this because their pork projects couldn't gain enough votes to become a bill on its own merits.     Obama asked that all pork be kept off this bill, but old habits die hard. Who knows how much more will be added by the Senate.    And Warren T is correct. This is how they ensure that they get re-elected. They tell the voters to look at how much they've gotten for their state.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	I guess you don't want the $275 billion in tax cuts, either.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	They bought the election by promising everyone else my money.

This item has sparked calls for an investigation, because the chief lobbyist of the National Parks Association is the son of Rep. David R. Obey, D-Wisc. The $2,25 billion is about equal to the National Park Services entire annual budget. The Washington Times reports it is a threefold increase over what was originally proposed for parks in the stimulus bill. Obey is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.    $335 million for treatment and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.    $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. $4.19 billion to stave off foreclosures via the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. The bill allows nonprofits to compete with cities and states for $3.44 billion of the money, which means a substantial amount of it will be captured by ACORN, the controversial activist group currently under federal investigation for vote fraud. Another $750 million would be exclusively reserved for nonprofits such as ACORN  meaning cities and states are barred from receiving that money. Sen. David Vitter, R-La., charges the money could appear to be a payoff for the partisan political activities community groups in the last election cycle.    $44 million to renovate the headquarters building of the Agriculture Department.    $32 billion for a smart electricity grid to minimize waste.    $87 billion of Medicaid funds, to aid states.    $53.4 billion for science facilities, high speed Internet, and miscellaneous energy and environmental programs.    $13 billion to repair and weatherize public housing, help the homeless, repair foreclosed homes.    $20 billion for quicker depreciation and write-offs for equipment.    $10.3 billion for tax credits to help families defray the cost of college tuition.    $20 billion over five years for an expanded food stamp program.    *       $2 billion earmark to re-start FutureGen, a near-zero emissions coal power plant in Illinois that the Dept. of Energy defunded last year because the project was inefficient  *       $650 million for the digital television (DTV) converter coupon program  *       $88 million for the Coast Guard to design a new polar icebreaker (ship)  *       $448 million for constructing the Dept. of Homeland Security HQ  *       $248 million for furniture at the new Homeland Security headquarters  *       $600 million to buy hybrid vehicles for federal employees  *       $400 million for the CDC to screen and prevent STDs  *       $1.4 billion for a rural waste disposal programs  *       $125 million for the Washington, D.C. sewer system  *       $150 million for Smithsonian museum facilities  *       $1 billion for the 2010 Census, projected cost overrun of $3 billion  *       $75 million for smoking cessation activities  *       $200 million for public computer centers at community colleges  *       $75 million for salaries of employees at the FBI  *       $25 million for tribal alcohol and substance abuse reduction  *       $500 million for flood reduction projects on the Mississippi River  *       $10 million to inspect canals in urban areas  *       $6 billion to turn federal buildings into green buildings  *       $500 million for state and local fire stations  *       $650 million for wildland fire management on Forest Service lands  *       $150 million for Smithsonian museum facilities  *       $1.2 billion for youth activities, including youth summer job programs  *       $88 million for renovating the headquarters of the Public Health Service  *       $412 million for CDC buildings and property  *       $500 million for building and repairing NIH facilities in Bethesda, MD  *       $160 million for paid volunteers at the Corporation for National and Community Service  *       $5.5 million for energy efficiency initiatives at the VA National Cemetery Administration  *       $60 million for Arlington National Cemetery  *       $850 million for Amtrak  *       $100 million for reducing the hazard of lead-based paint  *       $75M to construct a new security training facility for State Dept Security officers when they can be trained at existing facilities of other agencies.  *       $110 million to the Farm Service Agency to upgrade computer systems|`|62d39e62fb5d002657b2c8a11e5d5cf5aa	There is no rational to irrational proposals.  Politicians "sweeten" proposals as a bartering weapon for their vote,  either for their own agenda, the agenda of their state, or constituents votes for the future.  I understand certain states need immediate help, that is a given and should be addressed wherein the urgency lies (humanitarian urgency).  As far as special interests: lobbyist have much to do with that, the contributions they contribute with their own agenda at hand.       It's been a mess in the political arena for decades and I certainly hope that tomorrow will bring a better day.  It's up to us, the citizens of the United States to speak up and speak out.

The payment will help cover the cost of books, supplies, equipment, and other educational fees for that academic term. The payment amount will be equal to either a quarter or half of the annual $1,000 cap for that academic year, depending on how the academic year is divided  quarter or semester terms    Housing Allowance:    If you are enrolled in a traditional college program as a half-time to full-time student, you will be paid a monthly housing stipend equal to the monthly Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for an E-5 with dependents.

Your pay starts while at Basic Training.        Enlistment Bonuses: If you score above a 50 on the ASVAB test, depending on the job you pick, you can qualify for up to $40,000 enlistment bonus.

At least the first package was directed towards stimulus by giving cash to banks to loan it out.  I disagreed with it but at least it had the right intent.  Of course, leave it to Congress to draft the bill and forget to put in a measure to prevent fraud, and now executives are taking some of that money for themselves!    The thing about the Obama bill though, most of it isn't even stimulus related.  People can argue that it's great to spend umpteen billion on AGW research, but then call it what it is.  It's not like there's a bunch of unemployed global warming modelers out there hitting the pavement.  This is an appropriations bill and worse yet, the stimulating portion of the bill is for infrastructure, meaning it won't even kick in for a couple more years!

WBDsKwylaa	An Americas Report news investigation shows individuals posing a terror threat to the United States are increasingly obtaining access to stolen or doctored passports, which then can be used to obtain visas to enter the U.S. with the purpose of carrying out terrorist attacks.     The report notes several instances where this has already happened:       Four of the 19 hijackers from 9/11 carried genuine Saudi passports that had been "manipulated in a fraudulent manner" to obtain genuine U.S. visas.       In 2005, four individuals were charged with smuggling dozens of Iraqis and Jordanians into the U.S. through South America beginning in 2001 on stolen European passports.       In 2007, an NBC News investigation uncovered a black market for stolen passports in Latin America.       Last week, three Afghani Muslim men were caught carrying genuine stolen Mexican passports with their pictures and data while en route to Europe.      The report notes that Latin America, which now has a large Hezbollah presence, especially in Argentina, Venezuela, Paraguay and Brazil, is increasingly becoming the point of entry because documents are easily obtained.           In addition to those countries is Nicaragua, which has a large Iranian presence. Iran also has a huge embassy in Managua where diplomats enjoy immunity and the full support of President Daniel Ortega, the report finds.           The Venezuelan government, lead by President Hugo Chavez, also has issued passports and official documents to members of Hezbollah and Hamas, whose cause Chavez believes in.           Experts agree South America has become a place of preference for terrorists that want to travel to the United States, making it imperative for U.S. agencies responsible for protecting the American public to become more vigilant.           It now seems that any person wanting to attack this country could use doctored or manipulated passports or could simply travel to Mexico and pay a Coyote to illegally cross the border, the report concludes. Its just a matter of time, if it has not already happened, before a terrorist, is able to get to the United States using a stolen, doctored passport.|`|i0LUuhyLaa	Of course!

They are screwing up there, and in a dozen other areas that require someone who has more than superfical loyalty to our country.      Utah is very symathetic to the illegal aliens, partly because they are joining the Mormon Church.   They were joining the LDS and in return, the LDS helped them get into the United States.  One such job was taking care of luggage in the Salt Lake City Airport.  Amazing.
PI8VfiY1aa	In short, No.     it's not statutory rape unless an adult (18+) has consensual sex with a minor (17-)    If was consensual, she cannot press charges.     But if it wasn't consensual, she would have to prove in court beyond a reasonable doubt that he forced her to participate, in which case the charge wouldn't be statutory rape but  sexual assault.    Charging someone with rape is a very serious accusation. Consequentially, FALSELY accusing someone of rape makes you a target for a counter lawsuit- Character defamation, slander, and libel suits could be filed against you. I would proceed carefully.

Although, even when Bush was in office, the republican House representatives from my home state, opposed the bailouts, of course many other republicans did not.

Carter laid all the groundwork to get the hostages out of Iran; unfortunately, the first attempt to release them failed and Reagan and the Republicans were able to hold off their release until Reagan was in the White House.  Carter did more for world peace than most people will ever know, and went on to become a Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2002.  Comparing him to ex-Gov. Blagojevich is like comparing Martin Luther King, Jr. to Chris Rock.      What did Carter do that you consider him to be an unworthy Christian?  What did he do that you consider to be "horrible"?  He was a very good person who tried to do what he thought was right for our country.  He didn't lie; he didn't cheat; he didn't make deals under the table; he tried to do what was best.  His only real failing was that he had a tendency to believe what people told him ... always a mistake in politics.|`|VKrePQZqaa	Blago, he is much more entertaining.

Most in the North saw black people as lesser beings, but not low enough for slavery.  It's rather a bit how people see dogfighting today.    Most people are against dogfighting.  But you'd be hardpressed to find someone who believes dogs are equal to us, and that is why they should not be forced to fight.  They are against it, but still see dogs as lesser beings than humans.    Well that is how most in the North saw black people back then.  Lesser beings, but not so much lesser that they should be enslaved.|`|lJPT0PGGaa	True.  Try not to think of it as "slavery", just a great guest worker program.|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	It is true but redundant in that  what eradicated means  is that no people still own slaves. Perhaps what you mean is outlawed. It would also be more accurate to say "some" instead  of "many" because most people  did not own slaves even in the  South were where it was much more common. However it is not true that most people did not see it as wrong, even Jefferson did although the part about Sally Hemming is true and her descendants have been shown to be related the Jefferson by DNA test.    "Jefferson owned many slaves over his lifetime. Some find it baffling that Thomas Jefferson owned slaves yet was outspoken in saying that slavery was immoral and it should be abolished. Biographers point out that Jefferson was deeply in debt and had encumbered his slaves by notes and mortgages; he chose not to free them until he finally was debt-free, which he never was. Jefferson seems to have suffered pangs and trials of conscience as a result. He wrote about slavery, "We have the wolf by the ears; and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other."|`|1TJ5v6Xzaa	Many, as in most, people did not own slaves.  Slaves were expensive, only the rich people did.|`|rrSaoOK2aa	False.  Many people were against slavery for 100 years before the Civil War.    Few people owned slaves in the north and south.      And, Jefferson had that baby when slave Sally was only 13 years old.|`|lXOkRTPaaa	That is a poorly formed question. Come up with a better question and you might get a good answer.

AA11163314	As a government Hamas is responsible for any attacks on a neighboring country that are launched from its territory.  This is a basic rule of international law.    And Israel has every right to demand that Hamas and its affiliates cease shooting at them before they will negotiate.|`|1ycL4PZ8aa	Nothing is wrong with the picture. The Palestinians, as usual, are acting in a dysfunctional, inept, ineffectual and fractured fashion. Al-Aqsa may be lying or stretching the truth. Hamas has sworn to be Israel's permanent enemy. 'Nuff said.|`|TA1oouovaa	Well, Hamas says its the democratically elected government of the Gaza Strip.  If Israel takes them seriously, then Hamas is indeed responsible to maintain peace and security there.  If illegal armed groups (as such paramilitaries as Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades would be if indeed Hamas is the elected government) are attacking sovreign states for territiry Hamas governs, then they are responsible to shut them down.    As Hamas refuses to act and stop such attacks, and, in fact, encourages them, it is not unreasonable for Israel to pressure them.    And, Hamas has never expressed a sincere interest in peace -- everyone knows that.  Surely you are neither so naive or ignorant as to not know that.  Hamas is obviously encouraging Al Aqsa, so that attacks can continue, all the while professing interest in peace to take in suckers like you (whoops, there go my 10 points -- but it's true; and don't worry, the Europeans buy it too so you're not alone).    Having had to live in Israel for several years for my work, I have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of Israel up close.  And I have to say, I fully support them in their efforts to crush Hamas, who will never, NEVER stop attacking them.

You can live with him at his duty station as long as he has what is called accompanied orders. Those are going to the majority of the places he will go. There are times that they get orders to places like Korea, Japan and a few others that you will not be allowed to go with him but they are usually only for 12-18 months, You obviously cannot go with him if he deploys to the Middle East.     If it's in the contract then they get it.

I asked for Airborne Infantry and 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas.  I got it in writing and that is what happened.    You get to live on base with your husband after he is finished with his training.    You get to live in your free housing if he deploys.  That will be your home as long as he is stationed at that base.    My wife and daughter lived at Fort Hood with me.  I went to Grenada, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Korea, Kuwait, and a few others.  I always went back to Fort Hood after deployments.  That was home.    It is a great way of life.  Where else can you retire with benefits after 20 years?|`|ohafdshKaa	All of these answers are valid and provide good guidance.  You will live as a family in Gov't housing(2-3 Bedroom townhome).  The only real difference for you and your family besides the guaranteed paycheck and free rent/utilities, is you would likely spend time apart from your husband while he's deployed.  That is something to be considered heavily because it is hard.  Although there are organizations provided by the military that support spouses separated by deployment.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	When he has accompanied orders then you can be with him. If it is unaccompanied orders or deployment then you cannot be there.  Usually he will be assigned to a command at a base, that is his command.  This is when he will be on either accompanied or unaccompanied orders.  If it is accompanied then the military will move you to that location, you qualify for housing or BAH (Housing Allowance) to live out in town and it pays your rent/utilities.    If he deploys from this location you can remain there in the housing or in the rental    If he is on unaccompanied orders (ie Basic, schooling, some overseas locations) then you can't live in housing but he gets BAH based on your location (unless you move during this time it will remain where it was originally).    Yes he can die but he can also die while he is walking down the street, driving a car, or any place else.  There is risks but there is risks everywhere.      Sometimes there is Recruiters that say things that try to entice you but not everyone is like that.  You do get medical, dental (monthly charge), base access, etc... that is something that they are not wrong about.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Don't listen to the "Trolls"...

The Army has always given us everything stipulated in my husbands contracts(bonuses, choice of duty station, etc) He could be in a bad car accident driving to work does that mean he is going to stop driving? It's not for everyone but my family has always been completely satified with our Army life.    ^^^Thanx above me I'll return the favor....as an added note we even had picking his R&R dates from Iraq put in one of his re enlistments and they gave it to us----seems silly but I wanted to know when he was coming home....lol|`|JDxpjT34aa	Once your husband is in the military you will be living with him (it's what base housing is for) except when he's in boot camp or when he's deployed. Daily life normal when he's not deployed. When he's deployed life goes on....he just won't be there for awhile. Although getting killed is a concern he has no reason to convince himself of it, h'es more likely to go to war and live to tell about it.|`|neWbgaHCaa	Base housing is abundant in the Navy. You may have to spend some time on the waiting list. I waited for 6 months. When he is not deployed he will come home regularly.  Pay and medical is the only thing that he should count on when joining the military. Pay isn't bad, but it's not great. Medical is damn near free, so that's a plus. On base shopping is tax free, but prices can still be cheaper off base.  If he is worried about getting killed then he should spend more time talking to the Air Force or Navy recruiters.|`|8fa967c1b5f3cca6f2fb5e744f6c7c01aa	you will live with him on base...unless you choose to stay in the house you are in now.. depending on how far away you guys live from each other you can see him every weekend. you cant stay at the baracks if thats what you are talking about, but their are base motels that are really cheap.  It really depends on what branch too..marine corps infantry is probably the most dangerous.  However we are pulling out of Iraq, and it is unlikely he will be killed unless he is on the fron line in Afghanistan|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	Don't know how much this will help seeing that I'm in the reserves and not active duty, but I can tell you the Army will give you everything that is written in the enlistment contract. If it's not written in the contract, it's not guranteed. Basically, the recruiter can say anything they want to get you to join (not all or even most recruiters will outright lie but some obviously do) but in the end if it's not in writing it probably isn't going to happen. As far as living on base, it would depend on what base you get assigned to. I think most bases have limited housing actually on base and married service members usually will have housing off base. You get what is called Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) and it's different depending on where you assigned. For example an E-5 with dependents stationed at Nellis is entitled to BAH around 1323 per month. Do a google search for BAH and see what areas pay what for different enlisted to get a general idea of what you might get. The chances of husband dying while in the service is dependent on many factors. Most of which are what job he picks. Outside of combat related deaths, most deaths in the service is the result of carelessness so as long as he thinks about what he's doing he should be ok. Hope this helps some.|`|yaCCJNKEaa	Everybody else pretty much covered it so I will add something different.  We live on post and on an Army post, any Army post, anywhere in the world...you can go knock on a person's door, introduce yourself and that person will be happy to see you and offer to help in anyway they can. I flew down to Kansas a few weeks ago on the spur of the moment to attend my husband's redeployment ceremony.  I had the name and address of one person in the entire state of Kansas, I showed up unannounced and there was that immediate bond...they are your Army family.  And I can safely assume that the other answerers feel the same way. This is one of the many reasons that this gig is the best in the world.

OfGpGFZKaa	Generally, yes. He will have his Airman's run and coin ceremony that Thursday. This is where he actually recieves the title of Airman, no more Trainee! Then he'll be released for base liberty. This means you guys can spend time together on Base. Friday is Parade in the morning (the actual ceremony), and then he is released for the day and must return by whatever curfew he is given. Then Saturday, most people receive a town pass. This means he can finally leave Lackland with you! Sunday is usually base lib like the other days with an earlier curfew (usually between 3-6pm). Now, there's a few things to take into consideration. This is the military, so nothing is promised or set. His TI has the power to restrict his base lib or town pass time if he or his flight screws up. Mine took 2 hours away of Sunday base lib from our flight because one of our element leaders was flirting with an Airman from our brother flight. Also, with the new 8 week schedule, there may have been some changes to the exact schedule. He will have the oppurtunity to send a Graduation schedule along with Vehicle passes for anyone visting after he arrives at BMT. This should be what you go by. Another thing to consider, he will have the opportunity to gain extra town pass time by either achieving Thunderbolt or higher on his physical fitness evaluation, or by his flight doing well and earning honors. My husband and family were fortunate enough to get lodging on Lackland. So I was happy even if we didn't get town pass because I could spend all day with them at the hotel and not stuck at the PX or bowling alley like everyone else. Also, lodging is very affordable, BUT you must call and make a reservation ahead of time, AND they usually only take reservations 3 days in advance (this was as of August last year). Soooo, it really is up to you. It feels GREAT to see the people you care about after going through basic, and while even 30 minutes with each other seems worth it after such a stressful accomplishment, if it's not financially appropriate for you, then hopefully you can arrange a visit while he is at Tech school (this also depends on his AFSC and what kind of training he is in for it to be worth it). But coming from someone who went through just the 6 week BMT, I know I would've given anything for even just a minute with my family and for them to be there to see me graduate. It is such a proud feeling. He's made a great decision to join the Air Force, wish him good luck for me. BMT is over before you know it!|`|m5J36D28aa	There was no ceremony or time off when I completed basic and was put on a bus for tech school in Biloxi.|`|htaxf1jJaa	the day of graduation, you two will be able to spend the whole entire afternoon together as well as the day after/before graduation. [im pretty sure, thats what i read since my boyfriend is at Lackland AFB for basic for the Air Force too...graduating March 6th!!] you two will definitely spend more than 30 minutes together, but keep in mind that after those couple of days you spend with him he has to leave for tech school. he is allowed to have "town passes" and thats pretty much where he can leave base until a certain time then he has to report back to his barrack and you two can either be together on base, or in the san antonio area.

I actually went through this with my husband in dec 2008. They might send you a letter in the mail, if he put you as a contact. But graduations are always on fridays. So on the thursday before the graduation, you get to see him run by in squadron formation, and they have the coin ceremony. after that, from about 1pm to 6:30-7p, they can hang around on base with you. They cannot leave the base on that thursday. Then friday, after the graduation, they show you their dorms, and then they have a town pass. while i was there, my husband had a town pass until 7pm, on that friday and saturday. Town pass starts at 9am on saturday and he gets to hang out off base all day. He also had a town pass on that sunday from 9am until 7pm, but i left on sunday morning. But in all, yes you will have time to spend with him. (unless he did something wrong and his TI takes his town pass, but im sure he'll behave.) And to give you a heads up, I stays from the weds before the graduation and i left that sunday morning, and i spent about $600, and another $200 once i got there for food, shopping, etc. And that was just for one person! let me know if you have any other questions... im more than willing to help :)
DgLBtjWoaa	The test if called the ASVAB, and there's little to no high-level math on it. The test rates things other than the "Big Four" subjects, but it also tests your knowledge of basic, basic physics (like, which way does this gear turn if the gear next to it turns this way?), coding speed, and the rate at which you can do simple math.     The minimum score to get into Security Forces is relatively low, so no worries. You'll be fine, but if you're worried about it, you can find ASVAB study guides at most bookstores.|`|AA11914352	you would be good, i passed my test when i was in 11th grade in high school and once i graduated from 12th grade high school i join the army, the air force is the best cuz they dont workout that hard.|`|55062f1da9e69ceae524d4b7307214e6aa	The ASVAB is written on a 5th grade reading level, and tests skills up to an 8th grade level.

Wage-earners, both the white and blue collar middle class collectively pay all the taxes, fight in all the wars, serve on all the juries, and do all of the work that needs to get done....and they always have and always will.  The upper 5% will never lose a dime or miss a meal as long as the folks that tote the barges and lift the bales are justly compensated for their labor and for their service to our country.  The reactionaries that hijacked the current GOP have it entirely backwards.  The insane propaganda of the right, that lowering taxes for the corporations and 'the rich' would somehow help raise the standard of living for the working class has always been no more than self serving disinformation.  All wealth flows upwards....that's why the owner of the plantation was rich and the field hands weren't.  The right is still trying to maintain this nonsense....possibly some of them really believe this foolishness, and certainly a lot of Americans who should know better believe it as well.  But if 'trickle down' economics had any validity, we wouldn't be in the situation that were now in...would we?  Results count.  this republican experiment has proven itself wrong and until this is turned around, it, not President Obama is what may yet 'kill us' all.  No kiddin'!

I'll try to answer them all.    Yes, Obama is a mulatto.  So am I.  Although we were born in different circumstances and different places, we are near to the same age and we grew up in the same generation.  Of course I can only express my views which may not be accurate for him.    When I was growing up, being a mulatto wasn't necessarily a good thing.  Whites would say that I wasn't "white enough" and blacks would say that I wasn't "black enough".  I can remember when I was young how there were race wars in the local high school.  There was always trouble.    Mulattoes can have a variety of different physical characteristics.  Some look more "black", which is to say that they have darker skin, brown eyes, and black curly hair.  Others will be lighter skinned, green eyes, and can have straight hair.  Yet others come out with things like red or brown afros (I have cousins like that), dark skin with dirty brown curly hair (another cousin), or many other combinations.    In most areas, there were no mulatto communities where we could identify with others.  I was lucky that I grew up in a community of mulattoes but that is rare.  Some of us made a choice who/what we related to the best.  For others like Obama, who has more traits of a black person, he wouldn't have had the opportunity to choose.  Society choose how they would see him.  Society sees him as black.  Since my skin is lighter, the black community generally doesn't see me as black (I've been told that I'm not the right shade)    He embraced his African heritage more than his European heritage.  There are many references to this.  That doesn't mean that he denies his European heritage.  Only that he relates better with African.  The opposite is true for me.  Obama doesn't deny is European heritage just as I don't deny my West Indies heritage.      However, I would be very uncomfortable with anyone "praising" my European heritage exclusively.  I'm not white even though I can "pass" if I wanted to.  I would feel that was dishonest and I was brought up in a family of many different colors where skin color was as unimportant as eye color.  I don't like it when someone concentrates on the lightness or darkness of my skin color.  I don't know if Obama feels the same way or not.  Somehow, I doubt it but I can't speak for him.    The only way that this would be considered racist is if a person felt that one race is inherently superior to another (that's the definition of the word "racism")    Thankfully, today's world is much different than it was back then.  However, "back then" is when we were searching for our own identities and it was the world we grew up in.  I was lucky that I grew up in an area where mulattoes were (and still are) common.  Few people were that lucky and they needed to fit in where ever they could.    Considering all of the changes in society in the last 30 to 40 years, I think that someday, skin color won't mean much someday.  I think that day will be in my lifetime but it certainly isn't right now considering all of the unnecessary focus that people have over race (blacks and whites).  But I honestly think it will happen.|`|0hdo4WORaa	Look at him.|`|f486fd7f52b6752e6c5831be9cebec30aa	Well, why don't you call him white and we blacks can call him black. That way we all compromise and get along.|`|PoJLz2fhaa	Because would you know he was 1/2 white just by looking at him?|`|NqNbIp2caa	For someone so obsessed with race she feels a need to break it down into fractions saying race is an issue for black people in general is an odd claim.  Shall we just say he is the "blackest" president so far?|`|YupMCYHlaa	In the US we see people based on what color they are.  Maybe it's wrong. Well, it's definitely wrong.  But we figure someone is black because he is -dark-.  Colin Powell is half black, so is Tiger Woods, but they are all considered 'black' because they look black.    Obama isn't like a black person in most ways.  He sure doesn't talk like a black person.  Culturally he has more in common with Kenyans than he does with American blacks.     But black people are proud and happy (and so am I!) that we have gotten over our racism enough to elect a -dark- man as president.  I know we've been making progress in racial equality and 'color equality' but I would never have believed we'd elect a black-looking president in my lifetime.  And even though I didn' vote for Obama because of his color, I think it says some nice things about America that we are able to do this, to elect a brilliant, learned man -despite- his color.|`|wppUvy4maa	I prefer half and half in my coffee but not in my leader.|`|AA10789965	why don't you take some happy pills...it seems to be an issue for you..you are the one asking the question..|`|d997b5ac6eed086c92a56500bdb74431aa	That's not politically correct, just stupid.    Grow up, Missy.|`|AfaFCiKxaa	Because anyone with dark skin the U.S. self-identifies as black.  It has to do with the way white people respond to them.  When we get to the time that everybody is treated equally all the time then it won't matter what people call themselves.
HxURXoe2aa	i dont think minors should even be able to be brought up on criminal charges period! because their brains are not even fully developed and proper thinking cannot be expected.. there are usually extenuating circumstances... for example, i heard that an 8 year old boy killed his parents because they spanked him every day... he told himself that if they spanked him 1000 times he would kill them. he actually counted. and killed them. they deserved it. he should be let off. i know 8 is young but some people would argue that murder is an adult crime... if they convicted that kid he would be a waste of space sitting in jail for life... if they put him in therapy and gave him some decent parents... he would have a real shot.    i didnt retire from my life of crime and drugs until i was 19 years old... everyone deserves a second chance. if youre not an adult, they sould not try you as an adult. but i have no sympathy for rapists... they should get the death penalty and be raped everyday for 2 straight weeks before they kill them!|`|CQq034fbaa	maybe if you get off ******* you will understand why  does it taste good   i know you like to suck it|`|AA11494150	If you are the victim of a crime, it does not matter if the offender is a minor or an adult. Being robbed by a minor is just as traumatic as an adult. Having something stolen by a minor is just as gone as if it was an adult.     As long as they are old enough to know right from wrong, I have no problem when the courts treat them the same.|`|r10dlDsGaa	I think it really depends on the case, but in a lot of instances yes.  For hundreds of years, people younger than 18 were shouldering enormous responsibility effectviely.  They were having babies, leading armies, and running countries.  Why is it that suddenly they can't think for themselves?  If I'm the wife of a husband who was murdered, I don't give a d@mn if the murder was 16 or 60.  I am going to be just as scarred, just as lonely.  If a kid is old enough to choose to be part of a gang, choose to steal, and choose to rape, then he or she has chosen to be an adult.|`|Ob3CFWVraa	Yes..... they are still humans committing a crime, if we are all equal, shouldn't we be punished equally? And shouldn't someone who is a serial kille be punished the same regardless of age? I think so.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	We decided a long time ago that minors are children and should be treated like children.

You would be among women who take pride in service and whose contributions as highly trained professionals are held in high regard by all members.    There is a large diversity of religion and ethnic and national origins in the Air Force, but rest assured your religious views will be respected and you may even have the opportunity to attend services on your drill weekend if you job permits.     Don't listen to the naysayers.  A woman's place is where she makes it.  There are many ways to give back.  Service to your country and to your bretheren at arms is noble and a sign that you hold service before self. Let your light shine, girl.  If you have the skills to give back, you honor him who gave you those skills when you put them to good use.    I believe the Bible emphasizes the importance of showing our faith in our works in James 2:14-26.|`|Cp502oJNaa	i think its a great idea good pay health care and you get to serve your country

God save America and the world.|`|Zj98QaECaa	It is still to early to decide, his "100 days of presidential evaluation" are not over yet so we still don't know if he will actually make all these big changes he promised.      Just for general knowledge- the first 100 days of presidential evaluation "tradition" started during FDR's term when he passed many of the New deal laws. (Thats probably why he got elected 4 times before the Constitution was amended so that a president could only serve 2 terms in office.     Basically, my point is if Obama does something of a positive effect on America during his first hundred days, then he will get re elected, if not then he just won't serve another term.|`|q6sRSLI1aa	What kind of question is this? Does the answer even need to be said? NO! He is breaking his campaign promises, he is appointed people that ran from the government, he has shown his true side. I would most definitely love to see Sarah Palin in the White House! I mean, look at the Supreme Court. There was a black man in the Court before there was a woman. So it only seems natural that there would be a black man in the White House before there is a white woman. It is only a matter of time before he is impeached. If it comes out from the Blago Wiretaps that the had something to do with the "selling" of Obama's Vacant Senate seat, then Obama will be impeached. Then God HELP US! We'll have a PResident who wants to give our U.S. Navy to the U.N. That's right folks! Vice President Joe Biden wants the U.S. Navy under U.N. contorl. That is what he was trying to push in the Senate, so why shouldn't he try to do so if he were ever to become President. I mean, we don't even own some of our most treasured monuments don't even belong to us!|`|zjpB2GARaa	I don't think Obama will get re-elected.  He will fail in his attempt to repeal the laws of economics and should be a sitting duck within a year from now.  The Republicans will gain more representation with the new census (red states are mostly increasing in population, as Americans are fleeing blue states for the stronger red state economies; for example, Alabama has taken control of the car industry from Detroit), which will make it easier for them to get elected.  What matters most is making sure the right Republican challenges Obama in 2012 because the winner of the Republican primaries (which will be held in 3 stages, starting with the traditional early states in January, then the small states in February, then the big states will distribute most of the delegates in March) will probably be our next president.    Personally, the candidate I anticipate coming out of the Republican field is Ron Paul.  He was mocked by the media during his 2008 campaign for predicting the events that have come to pass over the last few months.  He had a faulty strategy in 2008 (from which he has learned).  He alienated many Republicans with his foreign policy views (foreign policy should be a minor issue in 2012 and no honest limited government Republican can criticize Ron Paul's domestic policies).  However, he showed the ability to raise money on par with Obama and drew younger voters, first-time voters, and Democrats far better than any other Republican.  His one liability is his age (he'll be 77), but his health is far better than McCain's and he can overcome that with a wise VP selection.  I think Republican primary voters are going to be hard-pressed not to vote for the candidate who is both the strongest advocate of limited government and the most electable candidate.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	No. God help us if he does.|`|x12mMdApaa	no, no, no,...

mPNai10Daa	A violation is one thing but a violation while openly challenging the world police is a slap in the face. Each country have the right to challenging the UN but no country have the right to openly put down by try to make up an reason to invade anouther country without just cause(at this time in world history there is none). And the USA wanted the oil. The one thing wrong is the USA to depend on other countries. The USA really should start back looking into our own- own land top and bottom- own people old and young can make a difference(aka USA workforce)- education stop put learning out of reach if the children want to try(give at least one year for free college to the children under the age of 25- pay to keep the geat ideals in the USA(yes, i said it all the geat ideals in history in the last 200 years came from us(comb, brush, ice cream, lights,cell phone) we are the dreamer. Now, Obama and all the great and not so great man before him and the great men, women, and yes children that will come after him. Not just a black men but the people from all the nation that come here to think and grow who said this is home. NOT because they have to but because they want too. OK, Isreal still freind will the other great powers(not trying to change the way the world see religion) but Iran is not just because they want the world to pratice the same religion and that is just not going to happen. To worship in any matter is up to the each person not the goverment at least in this country. But all violation should have been address as well.      (This is the way I see it.

Iran is Muslim, they don't get treated fairly.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Because Israel has only sought peace since the modern state of Israel was founded. Even with implacable enemies surrounding them, they have always gone to the bargaining table, seeking only peace.    In Iran, Ahmadinejad has repeatedly talked about wiping Israel off the map.  Iran is and has been sponsoring terrorists in Iraq, as well as being patron to both Hizbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, giving them training and arms to act as proxies in their attempts to kill Jews and eradicate Israel.    And it is also America's friends in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, etc who are not very happy with the prospect of a nuclear Iran trying to establish an Iranian nuclear hegemony over the Persian Gulf.    They have no such fears regarding Israel.    There's a night and day difference between the two.

That great danger is the Jew. Gentlemen , in whichever land the Jews have settled, they have depressed the moral level and lowered the degree of commercial honesty. They have created a State within a State, and when they are opposed, they attempted to strangle the nation financially as in the case of Portugal and Spain."      "If they are not excluded from the United States by the Constitution, within less than a hundred years they will stream into our country in such numbers that they will rule and destroy us, and change our form of government for which Americans have shed their blood and sacrificed life, property and personal freedom. If the Jews are not excluded, within 200 years our children will be working in the fields to feed the Jews, while they remain in the Counting House gleefully rubbing their hands."       "Their ideas are not those of Americans. The leopard cannot change his spots. The Jews are a danger to this land, and if they are allowed to enter, they will imperil its institutions."      "They should be excluded by the Constitution."             "They [the Jews] work more effectively against us, than the enemy's armies. They are a hundred times more dangerous to our liberties and the great cause we are engaged in... It is much to be lamented that each state, long ago, has not hunted them down as pest to society and the greatest enemies we have to the happiness of America."

nNmusYZSaa	I googled "civil union vs marriage?" and this was the top report.    It actually goes into some detail, so I won't embarrass myself trying to encapsulate it all in a short sentence. Suffice it to say that there do seem to be significant differences.    http://lesbianlife.about.com/cs/wedding/...    The big ones seem to be taxation, immigration, family law and divorce protections,equality of treatment from state to state, and certain spousal benefits such as social security and pensions.|`|qgL98Wv2aa	none that i can think of.....they would decide when it comes to medical decisions for each other....legal matters.....can sign contracts together say like for homes( which they can now without a marriage certificate)  have bad arguments like married couples....fight over who left the seat up on the toilet.......have great date nights.....enjoy good movies together.....go to boring weddings and family gatherings....so when i think about it NONE        LET'S RODEO SAN ANTONIO YEEEEE.....HAAAA|`|qhdhva5Daa	Then why have marriage at all?|`|9HvHmwTNaa	the right to be normal|`|3ME7sBxjaa	I'm pretty sure transferring of property without having to pay taxes is a big deal.  The only reason I doubt myself is because I haven't heard anyone bring it up before.    If I want to give my girlfriend my car she's supposed to pay the sales tax on it even though I am gifting it to her.  If we were married it wouldn't be a problem.|`|wQ5LKysaaa	What state?  If you are talking about California, none whatsoever.  With ONE exception, the united couples' right to legally call it a marriage.    Why not let them call it a marriage?  Simple:  To uphold seperation of church and state, AND religious freedoms.  If law becomes involved in a religious institution, the state could mandate pastors/churches to perform gay marriages or lose their license/tax exempt status.    End of story.    Wage Peace:  Marriage is not in the Bible?  Uhhhhh, perhaps you should try reading it.  Educate yourself.|`|VT9Sl9NNaa	I believe they don't get the hospital visitation rights that a married couple has; say one partner in a civil union falls ill and is hospitalized. The hospital will not recognize the other partner as family and will not grant them visitation rights.    Also, if a gay couple in a civil union has a biological child; artificial insemination for a lesbian, or using a surrogate womb for a gay man, if the partner that is the parent dies, the child goes the other biological parent, not the gay parent.     Married couples get tax deductions that couples in civil unions can't get. Also, if one partner gives a large sum of money to the other, unlike in a marriage, that money is taxed. Did you watch the series finale of Boston Legal? Denny and Allan got married so that Denny could give Allan money he needed for a charitable fund he wanted to start without the government taking a massive chunk of it, like they do with lottery and game show winners.     Not to mention, the feeling of being treated like a normal person.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Absolutely none, they just want to sht all over religion and the sanctity of marriage.|`|xJmDP5NGaa	the "right" to impose their view on others and change society and religion.....as far as that goes......they can kiss me RIGHT on my??? before they tell me what the definition of my marriage is....|`|q4EXFhV7aa	The protections do not extend beyond the border of the state and no federal protections are included with a Civil Union. Civil Unions offer some of the same rights and responsibilities as marriage, but only on a state level.  Recognition in other states  Dissolving a Civil Union v. Divorce:   Vermont has no residency requirement for Civil Unions. That means two people from any other state or country can come there and have a civil union ceremony. If the couple breaks up and wishes to dissolve the union, one of them must be a resident of Vermont for one year before the Civil Union can be dissolved in family court. Married couples can divorce in any state they reside, no matter where they were married.  Immigration:   A United States citizen who is married can sponsor his or her non-American spouse for immigration into this country. Those with Civil Unions have no such privilege.  Taxes:   Civil Unions are not recognized by the federal government, so couples would not be able to file joint-tax returns or be eligible for tax breaks or protections the government affords to married couples.   Benefits:   The General Accounting Office in 1997 released a list of 1,049 benefits and protections available to heterosexual married couples. These benefits range from federal benefits, such as survivor benefits through Social Security, sick leave to care for ailing partner, tax breaks, veterans benefits and insurance breaks. They also include things like family discounts, obtaining family insurance through your employer, visiting your spouse in the hospital and making medical decisions if your partner is unable to. Civil Unions protect some of these rights, but not all of them.|`|AA10953937	If they don't miss out on any rights, why not let them get married?|`|xJcW7cmVaa	tax breaks|`|8Kmp90JDaa	The federal government does not recognize gay marriage/civil unions (due to the Defense Of Marriage Act), regardless of state recognition. That means they cant file joint federal tax returns, they cant collect social security survivor benefits if/when their partner dies, etc. There are well over 1,000 rights and benefits granted by the Federal government and its various agencies to married couples that are denied to same-sex couples.    The rights offered are ONLY at the state level, and most of the rights that GLBT people are fighting for can only come from the federal government.    "Separate but not equal" is not good enough.    What is the argument against gay marriage? That God doesn't support it? That the bible is against it? Well guess what, this country is not a theocracy. Conservatives have NO right to dictate the laws and rights offered to citizens based on their bible. Separation of church and state is essential to freedom for all U.S. citizens.|`|3uH441n3aa	Lesbians don't have a best man at the wedding|`|IiPlkjNMaa	The right to show up at your church dressed in a pink tutu and say I do.|`|vNOkPdEMaa	none that I know of but I'm interested to see the answers.|`|kNCCrjOeaa	..... sometimes i just thinks its not even about the fact that they cant get married, its that they are being prevented from doing something becuz of their sexual preference, which is wrong!|`|gau0w8LMaa	No rights only benefits.     Civil unions are the best resolution to this problem. I don't care what other states rules are as marriage and divorce differ from state to state. It is a states rights issue and the fed has no business being involved.|`|v4qLlGGhaa	Federal tax credits. Federal tax benefits. Federal tax incentives. Adoption incentives. Adoption credits.    Social Security benefits for surviving spouse. Medicare for surviving spouse. Pension for surviving spouse.     Property rights for surviving spouse.

It blows my mind.|`|e7wD8sUiaa	Yes, especially when the one in charge of the I.R.S. didn't pay his taxes for four years.   He either cheated or he made mistakes(four years in a row). So he's either a tax cheat or he's incompetent. There is one other possibility. They may be trying to illustrate just how complicated the tax code is. They won't do this to effect reform, they will do it to push through Obama's idea of the government doing your taxes for you and sending you a form to sign and return(with your payment if you owe). This will ensure that people aren't paying attention to how much they are paying. That way they can continue stealing from us without too much public outcry.|`|52cGZS3caa	No|`|K4VZtIr3aa	You're a Foolish Republican....

Either way, it reminds me greatly of the New Deal.  Obama is the new FDR, and that's NOT meant as a complement at all!  FDR (and Hoover before him) took a recession and turned it into the Great Depression by taking money from businesses and letting the government spend everyone's money in an effort to "create" jobs.  Problem is, the recession painfully is supposed to work itself out by redirecting labor from things we don't need to things we do.  We make long- lasting cars, and people don't need a new one quite so often, but we keep building them at a fast rate.  Using a bailout to keep building cars no one wants treats the symptoms but doesn't address the underlying cause and in fact extends the illness.  Eventually many of those car manufacturing employees will have to go work on something like windmills (the demand for skilled windmill maintenance will be enormous in 5-10 years from now).  Today we now know that the New Deal extended the Depression by at least 5-6 years, because of ill-fated programs like these.|`|cRDbeUDvaa	Um....because he knows about macroecomics.  Times that it worked in history?  Every recession in the US where it was done, including by presidents Reagan (1982-83), Bush 41 (1991-93), and Bush 43 (2002-3).  Each time the government ran a deficit and the federal reserve cut interest rates by "printing more money" (expanding the money supply).  Two of those times (Reagan, Bush 43), the government cut taxes as well, which caused the goverment to borrow more money.  The economy recovered very nicely each time.  Thanks for asking.|`|5cc93dc15af56e8f47884e200463a48eaa	it's funny how you weren't crying about it when GWB was doing it...|`|7cc078f55da409c4d9b845dbc7c568daaa	well there have been numerous europea countries that tanked because of printing..    priting cause inflation *may as well burn you money) (more money that was earned in a system)    Barrowing and taxing means we pay more for the money(we pay $50 to get 25)  ?!?|`|c3vPZfghaa	yes every day throwing more money into a consumer based economy creates cash flow which it is dependent on.    examples:    -WWII  -Iraq war  -Katrina and every other disaster relief    The purpose initially isn't to stimulate growth, but to stop negative growth, and stabalize the system. After that free-market factors can resume, and correct the system.      Anyone who disagrees should take an econ class.

A young woman was about to finish her first year of college. Like so many others her age, she considered herself to be a very liberal Democrat, and was very much in favor of the redistribution of wealth. She was deeply ashamed that her father was a rather staunch Republican, a feeling she openly expressed. Based on the lectures that she had participated in, and the occasional chat with a professor, she felt that her father had for years harbored an evil, selfish desire to keep what he thought should be his.    One day she was challenging her father on his opposition to higher taxes on the rich and the addition of more government welfare programs. The self-professed objectivity proclaimed by her professors had to be the truth and she indicated so to her father. He responded by asking how she was doing in school. Taken aback, she answered rather haughtily that she had a 4.0 GPA, and let him know that it was tough to maintain, insisting that she was taking a very difficult course load and was constantly studying, which left her no time to go out and party like other people she knew. She didn't even have time for a boyfriend, and didn't really have many college friends because she spent all her time studying.    Her father listened and then asked, "How is your friend Audrey doing?"    She replied, "Audrey is barely getting by. All she takes are easy classes, she never studies, and she barely has a 2.0 GPA. She is so popular on campus; college for her is a blast! She's always invited to all the parties, and lots of times she doesn't even show up for classes because she's too hung over."    Her wise father asked his daughter, "Why don't you go to the Dean's office and ask him to deduct a 1.0 off your GPA and give it to your friend who only has a 2.0. That way you will both have a 3.0 GPA, and that certainly would be a fair and equal distribution of GPA."    The daughter, visibly shocked by her father's suggestion, angrily fired back, "That wouldn't be fair! I have worked really hard for my grades! I've invested a lot of time, and a lot of hard work! Audrey has done next to nothing toward her degree. She played while I worked my tail off!"    The father slowly smiled and said gently, "Welcome to the Republican Party."|`|0eFSeap5aa	Any man who is under 30, and is not a liberal, has no heart; and any man who is over 30, and is not a conservative, has no brains.    -- Winston Churchill|`|bjfHGZ7saa	you can't just change the way you think.|`|8gaPElwxaa	You don't convert, it is not a religion.

In this case, these reputable economists probably dont have any idea of what will work, since they are the ones who got us all into the mess in the first place, at least the ones in charge did, but you know what i mean.  AS for the the "stimulus", well, whether fixing the badly broken and falling apart infrastructure will miracualously fix our system of conspicious consumption overnight, who knows, probalby not, but at least we will have bridges and airports and roads and ports and a power grid and sources that work, and will pay for themselves in a comparatively short time.|`|BLd9eLjCaa	Just minutes ago some repub posted a question that was saying the opposite that all reputable economists tell that it is going to work.

The stimulus re-shapes policy in America, making the country more and more dependent on government.  Obama's job is to prep the US for entrance into a global government.  Blinton and Bush have laid the groundwork, and now Obama will finish the job.  Bankrupting the nation and having it 'foreclosed upon' by its foreign lenders is also part of the plan.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	There are a lot of GOP governors who disagree, including the rights new poster girl Sarah.
ohafdshKaa	Relax... He'll be fine.  The only thing that would delay his Grad. is if he hurts himself to the point that he can't perform on a limited basis or can't pass his Physical Fitness Test(which won't be the case by the time he's done) or he does something really stupid and gets in bad trouble.  If he gets the sniffles he'll just tough it out.  To give a perspective, I went thru basic at Leonard Wood with a Double Inguinal Hernia that would eventually require surgery but did not delay my Grad.    Compared to other places Leonard Wood is one of the more relaxed places.  After my training there I was sent to Ft. Benning and saw what the infantry guys did for Basic and there is a big difference.  So relax, even if it sounds like your BF is having a hard time just encourage him and when it's over he'll look back and laugh at what he thought was hard.  BTW, it's nice to see you're being honorable and sticking by him while he goes thru this, alot of girls don't.  Good luck to both of you.|`|pwdv08hVaa	im a Marine not a soldier, but i guarantee you basic training is never easy or fun, looking back on it you might have good memories but it always sucks while your there, anyone who tells you otherwise is lying|`|AA10450290	If he gets sick and admitted to the hospital it will delay his training because when you are in boot camp you have to complete so many days.  You cannot miss out on valuable training.  He is keeping warm. They give him enough clothing to keep him warm and he is being fed just fine.     Boot camp is tough for mostly everyone.  If it was fun and easy everyone would be doing it. They work them up each day and week to become stronger.  It is gradual and spaced out over the length of boot camp.    Every minute of his time is spent training while in boot camp.  He wants to call but he is not allowed to because of all the training. He is always thinking of you and that is one of the things that is helping him get through all the tough parts.    Hope that helped.|`|AFNgR9jTaa	It depends on how sick. If its something he can suck up like a cold or light flu then he will be fine. If he gets sick or injured and misses any required training he might be recycled to another cycle which is a delay but that depends on what training he misses and if there is time to make it up. I went to Leonard Wood myself and it wasn't bad. I miss basic to be honest. You make it as hard as you want or as easy. He is probably still in processing and doesn't have a mailing address you can write him back at yet so just wait and you should start getting letters. Just be careful what you send him though. The Drills will go through his incoming mail (No they won't read it but they check for contraband and Pictures of adult nature or anything that might hurt his moral.|`|htaxf1jJaa	yes if your boyfriend gets sick, it could delay his is graduation [but it depends on how sick he is. if it's just a cold and what not, he should be fine.]     My brother was in boot for the Marines from May 2008-August 2008 and he said it was really tough and what not but the most rewarding 13 weeks of his life. By the look on his face when i saw him on family day, he enjoyed boot, but also hated some days. [that's a normal thing].  My 'boyfriend' is at basic for the Air Force right now and he left Jan 5th. He wrote me in his first letter that basic wasn't anything that he had expected and it was really tough and stuff. But in his second letter [10 days after...he was going into his third week] he wrote me saying that basic is getting easier and easier by the day and that time is going to fly by. And honestly, time does fly by. Just write him as much as you can and give him all your support, you have nothing to be concerned about. I hope I helped

Yep that all makes a lot of sense.     This is the same state that charges high income taxes to people below the poverty line, then gives those people their own money back in the form of food stamps.

0eFSeap5aa	Just recently someone told me the justification for massive federal spending was that there were starving people here in America.  This came as news to me, because everywhere I look, including my own mirror, I see nothing but fat people.  Perhaps the starving ones are hiding behind the fat ones.|`|5Ho518J9aa	Not so. In fact, the metrics they use to come up with those numbers are getting tighter. It's a manuipulation of the facts to control the American diet. If we get Nationalized healthcare, all fatty and salty and sweet and carcinogenic foods need to be banned. Look at NYC. 2/3 of the City is using Nutritional Assistance programs, yet the foods are banned only in Restaurants. I don't know about you, but last time I checked, Pizza Hut didn't take food stamps. Neither did the Diner or McDonalds, yet all of them have had to modify their menus to suit the bans, costing them collectively hundreds of thousands of dollars in wasted food, nevermind the unbelieveably stiff fines. Most of the restaurants in NYC are family owned cultural food joints, so it's not so easy to just up and make the switch. Think about it, look at the criterium for obesity differences between 1979 and 2009.    EDIT: Last I checked, rice and dried beans, frozen veggies and fresh fruit were all quite affordable. The crap in the fancy packaging is also affordable, but it's all about choices, isn't it?

If a person is having financial problems (like most of us here in this state), grocery-buying is reduced to price-comparing which means that a person is not necessarily buying food that is healthy.  Families are eating a lot of spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, potato soup, bean soup and other foods that are cheap; in moderation, those foods are good for people.  However, when foods high in starch and calories are a mainstay in daily eating, people gain weight.  Your question makes it sound like people who are poor shouldn't eat all the time; I hope you are never in this situation.|`|Juw2uckPaa	The Sunday Houston Chronicle carried a story in the Outlook Section, written by George F. Will, Pulitzer Prize -winning syndicated columnist, based in Washington, D.C. He is pretty Republican leaning and I am a Democrat. However, I know he is very intelligent and while I do disagree with a lot he writes, I see a lot of truth at times. That is why I read his column. The article is entitled 'Deficit worse than it looks due to accounting tricks'. It is about government bookkeeping and how it makes things seem different than they really are. The article says, in part, that more Americans should read the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government - the only government document that calculates what deficit and debt numbers would be if the government practiced, as businesses must, accrual accounting. The article goes on to say, 'The report's numbers show that the true national debt is $56 trillion, not the widely reported $10 trillion'. Very somber reading.   In truth, if every one were 'fat' as you say, we would not be hearing of all the layoffs, foreclosures, bailouts etc. Macy's of the famed Macy Thanksgiving Parade announced they will be laying off 7000 people. Do you realize how many people have been laid off in the past month? If it weren't for SSecurity, Welfare, Retirement and other programs a lot of people would not be eating and a lot aren't any way. Pick up a paper, watch the news, check out what is happening all across the country, you'll learn a lot.|`|pw5po93Saa	Well thats funny because I know PLENTY of people who have lost their jobs. It's not just the media. For one--my boyfriend lost his job, his mother lost hers, my friend lost hers..and finding another one is a race. Seriously, if there's an opening around here it gets snatched up so fast. It has nothing to do with being fat. And one person had a point, when you don't have money, you buy what you can and eat unhealthy given the fact that you can't afford anything else. I hate ignorant people like you.    oh and we don't just follow our leader like sheep. Actually, most other countries do that. Are you living in this economy, this country? The only things most americans are saying right now is that we deserve help..meaning with yes, food, shelter, jobs ect. And if you disagree with that..you people are SICK. I'm living in this right now..it's not made up, it's not over dramatized. So many business are shutting down, jobs being cut out left and right. My family is struggling beyond belief..and we're one of the luckier ones. How dare anyone pass judgment on what is going on. Obviously those who are, aren't living it right now.     oh, and about healthy foods being cheap. some can be by themselves, but you can't--or shouldn't just live off of veggies. You should have meat, veggies, ect. Where I love, veggies are about 1.25 a bag, or for fresh more expensive for the same amount. I have a son, my boyfriend and me..right now. Now, you add meat, veggies,  and eerything else needed for just ONE meal..that one meal can be very pricey. Where as less healthy food can at least last longer. Though we want to be healthy, I'd rather us cut back costs and be able to EAT longer. Meat here, depending on the pounds, can range between 12-13 dollars for one meal for my family. 13 x 7 days is 91 right there..and thats one meal. Now, veggies. How about 1.25, for one serving. 1.25 x 7= 8.75. So now we're up to 99.75--with taxes probably around 100. Thats one meal a day for 7 days. now add two more meals a day to that total. Yeah. then keep in mind, drinks, household needs, ect.    Mind blowing, huh? It's money that can't be afforded right now.

AYR635jEaa	If a person is any good at their job they won't be making minimum wage for very long.      I repeat: IF YOU DON'T SUCK AT YOUR JOB, YOU WILL MAKE MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE.    Definition of not sucking at your job:    Showing up for work--on time - don't blame the bus if your late,  don't blame your kids if your late, don't blame the manager for scheduling you too early, if you need a day off ask well in advance or make other arrangements.  Working hard while you are there - do what is expected of you, don't expect a reward for doing what you are supposed to do, that's not how it works  Don't create more problems for your employer - Your problems are your own.  Don't expect the boss to sympathize, they have their own problems to deal with.  No drama!!    If you go above and beyond (trust me it's not that hard at these jobs) you'll get promoted, make more money, get off government assistance, and not be poor.    I'm done.  I could go on, but why?  I'm sure you won't get it anyway...|`|h9PVRHPWaa	Negative. Because you can always attempt to better yourself. A slave was stuck in his position.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	Of course not.  I don't know anyone who wants to be OWNED by another person nevermind the brutality that was also a part of slavery.  There are modern day slaves... I bet any of them would be happy to earn minimum wage at a lame retail job instead of being held captive and made to work in a factory or a brothel.|`|0eFSeap5aa	Slaves were not afforded the ability to better themselves through school.  They could be seriously injured or killed just for trying to learn to read.  They could be separated from loved ones at the whim of someone else  They could be murdered, raped, or robbed and had no recourse to any law  They did harsh labor under harsh conditions.  And they couldn't quit and go find a better job.  Nobody running the cash register at Wal-Mart or McDs has a life anywhere near as bad as one of a slave.|`|OnWmqs4paa	They got free health care...|`|92gN7RVPaa	I just can't understand how you're even comparing the two right now ..|`|e7wD8sUiaa	Minimum wage is entry level. If you are still being paid minimum wage after you've been there awhile you should ask for a raise. You do have that right, you know.   The bottom line is, You are providing a service to your employer. They are, in effect your customer. They are buying your services. They make you an offer and you can choose to accept it or ask for more. Usually you end up agreeing on a price that both of you can live with. Otherwise you can take your services elsewhere. It is up to you to know what the service you are providing is worth. That can vary depending on the job, the market and the economy as well as some other factors. If you are a responsible ADULT you should be able to do this. If not don't complain about how much you are getting paid.|`|Cni4Zh77aa	That's the fine service jobs that Bush created. You should feel lucky :p.|`|v1dnnMQuaa	Actually, I think slavery was probably far worse than working at McDonald's or even Walmart. But the minimum wage is only fit for teenagers who need some extra money.|`|AA12021966	Of course McDonald's and Walmart are better! They give people human rights!|`|9HvHmwTNaa	I tried to sell myself but no one's buying..........I'm married so I'm institutionalized.......same as slavery......|`|r1zjX6PAaa	slavery pro: free food and a free place to sleep  slavery con: it's slavery so you can't quit    minimum wage pro: you can quit when you want  minimum wage con: you can't afford food and rent|`|B309jFKeaa	At least Wallyworld and Mc D's doesn't attempt to beat you to death if you don't comply.  They just fire you.      no, slavery was not better.|`|52cGZS3caa	You ever been a slave? Not a smart thing to be comparing to a fast food job.|`|zjpB2GARaa	Of course, people who work at Wal-Mart or McDonald's are better off than slaves.  Wal-Mart actually pays their employees significantly above minimum wage (a few years ago, they asked for the minimum wage to be increased in order to hurt their competition).  Most people working at minimum wage are younger workers who are entering the wage market for the first time.  If the thugs calling themselves the "government" would stop stealing money from people (what they call "taxation"), people working at minimum wage would have more money and employers would have more money to pay their employees.    There is no such thing as "poverty" in a first world country.  So-called "poor" people have luxuries such as TV sets that genuinely poor people in backward (socialist) countries such as the so-called "developing" countries (which aren't "developing" due to their stubborn anti-market dogmatism which is propped up by "foreign aid" dollars from Washington, DC) don't have.  Fortunately, multi-national corporations are running so-called "sweatshops" to save the genuinely poor from subsistence farming and prostitution.  Oh, I forgot, the left wants to shut that down too and further impoverish the poor.    If you truly care about improving living standards, you ought to strongly oppose all of the anti-market crackpots, especially the environmentalists (a bunch of wealthy buffoons who always seem to propose "environmental protection" legislation that harms the economy) and the corporate lobbyists who favor government regulations (which are nothing more than a means to "protect" corporations from competition).  If we actually had a free market, everybody would be wealthier (just as people in a "mixed-market" semi-socialist country are wealthier than people in a communist slave state).|`|3ME7sBxjaa	Slavery makes you a non-person.  At least a minimum wager can walk off their job whenever they feel like it.  I suppose this is a question worth thinking about from time to time, but the answer is simple.  A minimum wager may feel like a slave, but the difference is drastic.|`|qhdhva5Daa	Try it out and give us a report.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	"Can you support 2 kids and yourself and a spouse on $7.5/hr or so? "    A minimum wage is not supposed to be a living wage. Wait untill you have moved up in the company(or gotten a better paying job), earning much more, THEN get married and have kids.|`|1TJ5v6Xzaa	Yes, you can. I grew up that way.  You just have to have no cell phones, cable tv, don't smoke and buy only what you need to live on.  Have only one car.  Vacation means driving to visit relatives, not disney.  Getting only a couple of toys and not rooms full of it.    Only my dad worked and he had a wife and 5 kids.  Then when Reagan became president, the economy got so good that he got a better job and then a better one, he was able to retire and not worry.      And no, he didn't get a union job.  Just a regular one.

TGPTu1Suaa	It sounds like you and your whole family really need some help.    If you sister was arrested for attacking you and your mom, then the prosecutor will or has already contacted you.  (If he hasn't, contact him).  Talk to him and tell him what happened.  Also, ask to be referred to any help he can offer to you as a victim.  There might be a "Victim's Services Office" or some other sort of social services office he can refer you to.    No one -- not a sibling not a strainger -- no one -- should be beating you.  You, your sister, and your family need to work out the problems, figure out what's causing your sister to lash out, and get her some help.
JTu1cLkYaa	The stimulus bill isn't in effect yet. It still has to pass the Senate and they have stated that they are going to change it. Then it has to go back to the House for approval of the changes before it can go to Obama to sign.    Any pork in the bill now comes from both sides of the aisle. This pork will either be cut by the Senate or have more pork added to it. It's too bad that the President doesn't have line item veto.|`|56650a55637223b1b968b4235bb50735aa	Obama has pulled a bait and switch at the national level.

Mission accomplished.|`|AA10301974	Tax cuts would have no better of an effect and would likely help people who need it less.     Government spending will greatly increase targeted markets. Just as it has in every war.     Have you never heard of a war time economy? That is a good economy that happens because the governments spend, spend, spend to support the war effort.     Obama will create the same effect, without the bloodshed.|`|4zijn0cgaa	The difference is the last stimulus bill was "BULL".

It might be whitehouse.gov or barackobama.gov but whatever it is the best thing to do is find the info. on a site like that. You can at times get good info. here but if you look ath the people here most people are just here to whine & don't get good info.EDIT: I don't have the info. but I am a real skeptic in life but I have faith in this President. I did my research during the campaign & there is so much false info. being spread by fox & rush & people who think if it is rep. it is Ok no matter what evidence shows. Obama has never been a man of pork. Look at his body. Look at Rush Limbaughs. You may not know much about the importance of this but our mind/thoughts create how we feel & how we feel creates how me behave & how we behave or reacte comes from all of this starting with the mind. If a person blow up like a balloon something is going on in there minds & you can see one who is educated & healthy & the other who is a nervous wreck & I don't think Rush even finished high school. I know Fox uses subliminal ways to get people to not think & I know this for sure. So I would have to beleive Rush is doing the same thing cause I can't think of how he can get people to be attracted to him if he is not hypnotising them.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	To quote a newly popular shirt: "I'll keep my freedom my money and my guns and you can keep your change!"

TEsq9K54aa	Bad, because of what happened as a consequence.    To make the decision look good (spinning) when there were very few black teachers it was decided to rubber stamp many of them through...in other words, pass or fail there were hundreds of black teachers magically produced in record quick time.    Since these teachers were under qualified and had very little ability the decline in educational standards commenced and is continuing to this day.    Affirmative action produces even more under qualified teachers who lack the ability and or training to teach effectively.    Throwing money at our Public schools sure doesn't help...we need good, dedicated and QUALIFIED teachers. By rubber stamping unqualified teachers we do a major disservice to ALL our children.  .|`|52cGZS3caa	You're joking right? You ever had to live with the effects of segregation?

I read Thomas Sowell's memoir and it seems to me that he went to school (in Harlem) in the 1940s (I think) with both black and white kids in his class. If a school was good, ALL of the students got a good education. And he went to a good school in Harlem and got into one of the "brainiac" public high schools in NYC. That was before I was born.    Whether anyone got a better education because of desegregation, I really don't know; I went to private school. I wasn't bused in or out of my own neighborhood. But public schools should be open to whoever happens to live in the neighborhood, I would think.    But I would think it was good for the nation in terms of keeping the peace at home and keeping the country united. I think that it was the RIGHT decision.

Why do our advertising executives not use their same tactics in other areas besides naive kids?|`|Cp502oJNaa	you can start as a seal from the start but you have to tell your recruiter that's what you want to do you will still have to go through basic like the rest of the navy|`|NXlsRNkHaa	I don't know you should sign up and ask the professionals....|`|Ro2ObPXlaa	You need to talk to a recruiter.  If you qualify, maybe they can put you straight in to the SEALs.  Not sure though.  Better start working out now!!|`|AA11914352	To be a navy seal you can also be in the army or marines not just navy and from there they pick the best marines, soldiers, and sailors to try and make it, but only half or less make it, there is also special forces in the army who you can go in and it would really help you so you can  be chosen, it takes a lot hun, but if you dedicate yourself to training everyday, and join the military you can get there.|`|neWbgaHCaa	Yes you have to be in the Navy to become a NAVY SEAL. You can talk to a Navy recruiter to put it in your enlistment contract that after boot camp you will go to BUDS school. That is the only short cut that I know of to become a SEAL.  If you do not make it to become a SEAL you will still be on contract to be in the Navy. It is a four year contract and should not be taken lightly.

o5aHZ1Xdaa	you can plead whatever you would like legally, but that defense is (no offense) laughable.    Officers determine "speeding" in one of two ways. They can use a radar to determine your exact speed, or they can see that you are going faster then everyone else, follow you, and by maintaining a constant distance and looking at their speedometer they can tell how fast you were going. Radar can not accurately detect the speed of something else if the radar is in motion (which it would be if they tried to radar from a moving patrol car)    He wasn't speeding, he was following you to determine your speed.     You can totally file a complaint if you think he was speeding, but that doesn't actually change the fact that you were speeding. My mom drives like a senior (maybe because she is =D) and cops would cut her off all the time, or flash their lights to get around her. They are breaking traffic laws, yes, but if they see someone else doing it there breaking the law doesn't effect their citing you for breaking the law too. (unfortunately)    -Shamar|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Yes, he can go your speed to see how fast you're going.    They can do what they want, they're the law.    Just make sure you take one of those driver's classes so your insurance doesn't go up|`|yAsLhdp2aa	he was following you at the same speed to get an accurate mph that you were speeding at.|`|FIG58FVpaa	The officer can pull you over for speeding and say that he calculated your speed by "pace". The speedometers in their cars are supposed to be certified.    Plea not guilty and go to court anyway... It can't hurt.|`|cYOePPzqaa	Yeah they can go whatever speed they want AS LONG as it's to catch someone going way over|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	Yes, a Police Officer can legally travel above speed limits in the line of his daily duties.     Your speed can quite accurately and legally be measured from a moving patrol car.|`|AA11124254	Yes he is.  The radar or laser is not necessary to judge speed.  The officer can also use his speedometer to meter your speed and determine whether or not you are speeding.  Pay the fine.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Yes, dear.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	Haha, why didnt you make a citizens arrest of the cop?|`|AA10003191	Sorry, but no.    If this isn't a first offense, get a good attorney.|`|7k1bu3c1aa	yes he can pull you over. yes you can get a ticket. but if I were you I would fight the ticket because 1) worst case scenario you have to pay it anyways and 2) if he didn't use a laser/radar gun to clock your speed you can argue there was no way you were going that much over the limit (and aim for a lower penalty).|`|VWLCwLNMaa	HAHAHAHA Nice try. But I think his speedometer is even better evidence of your speeding than a radar gun. HAHAHAHAHA He had to speed to catch you man. HAHAHAHAHAHA    But, you should definitely not allow this to prevent you from attending law school. HAHAHAHAHA|`|444pPdy5aa	Police are above the law or they think they are anyways|`|1QVAIKdyaa	ok my dad is a state cop and yes he can pull u over 4 speeding by folliwing u that is another way they can get u for speeding by how fast they r going to keep up with u but yea u can plead not guilty and hope that he dosent show up for the hearing cause alot of times they wont|`|90WuvdIvaa	Yes he is allowed because he is The LAW ENFORCEMENT.|`|WL3KcegWaa	Yes.... you should go to a judge and claim that you are innocent because the police officer was speeding too.      That would be funny.|`|iLeG9v2xaa	are you seriously that stupid they can catch you how ever they want but you know what you should plead not guilty and say that to the judge becasue he will piss his pants with laughter|`|oZQLBCPcaa	obviously he was behind you for a reason, why didn't you slow down|`|7HRdh3ITaa	It may vary from state to state. In my state, the police can use the technique used on you of speeding up as fast as you are going to determine your speed.|`|UYvgIazcaa	Absolutely.  Although in most states the officers are not supposed to do over 85 under any circumstances, that is often ignored.|`|36H5Lk4Baa	You lose, any way you look at it...pay the ticket!|`|kQzBf8x3aa	No, they do not have to be stopped in order to get you. In fact, they can be driving on the opposite side of the highway & still get your speed accurately enough to ticket you.|`|sbJCyPtlaa	It wont hurt to plead not guilty , can just be turned into a parking ticket depending on your driving record , officers are trained to judge your speed without having to use devices .|`|1Navi28Uaa	cops can pull you over. they have more authority than everyone thinks.and usually its because you may put others around you in danger. ive done 85 on the freeway and a cop came behind me. no one else on the freeway. he just blew right past me at 100 and didnt care.|`|hbFH7FZFaa	Yes Andrew, the officer can. The officer will probably articulate his or herself and can explain to the judge that you were speeding and at an attempt to bring you to a halt, I (the officer) had to increase his or her speed. No wins, bro!|`|44707e7b798fd01392ccb15cec3384afaa	yes they do this a lot he didn't have radar so seeded up to 2 feet off your bumper his speed track on his video so theres proof in court

You can't get a CCH  If you have a permissible purpose you can find a Private Investigator.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	I really don't think you can view them unless you can hack into the ncic network.|`|AA12053195	As far as I know, there isn't one website that would list that information.  I'm not sure where you're located, but many states have a website where they list public criminal convictions, and many counties have a website where outstanding warrants are listed. I live in Minnesota, and I know the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has a public website that lists criminal convictions, and the county I work for has all of our outstanding warrants listed there.  Good luck!|`|415e1e8d6024188583945ee6cded5be6aa	This may cost you a few $ but...  http://govarrestrecords.com/?tid=ar07    Or you can try your luck at "www.anystate.gov",   example: www.wyoming.gov  and put in your search criteria.

But thats definitely without a doubt.. a crime|`|AA10599026	Hmm, that's a new one. I would imagine that if she got a fraudulent power of attorney and a fraudulent loan, then fraudulently signed someone else's name to a legally binding document, she might be charged with fraud if she got found out. I would imagine that it would be a continuing fraud (is she paying it with checks she signs in his name?), so the statute would probably not apply. Or, if she gets busted and the prosecutor knows his or her stuff, they'd find a way to prove that it was an ongoing fraud and not have to worry about time limits.    However, if she legally had power of attorney (over her husband), then she had the legal right to basically sign him into any contract.|`|oFcrglxzaa	it's paid it's a done deal, it was sneaky but it was done right besides she did have power of attorney

AA12053195	I'm not sure where you live, so my answer may not be correct; here in Minnesota you would need to take them to "Small Claims" court.  Technically it isn't theft since they did have legal access to the equipment.  Small claims court is not criminal, but is civil in nature.  The other option is to contact an attorney and have them help you through it.|`|0eFSeap5aa	Who actually owns the equipment?  Your post doesn't make that clear.  If you can show a) you are the rightful owner, and b) they took it without your consent, then you report it as a theft.  However if it is not clear who owns it or who owes for it, you will probably have to settle this in court or through arbitration.    For future reference, put all such agreements in writing.  Who owns the equipment, who pays for it, what is its disposition if the band breaks up or members leave, etc.  Make sure the copies are signed by all parties and everyone has a copy.  Make sure to itemize things by manufacturer and serial numbers.|`|44707e7b798fd01392ccb15cec3384afaa	screw them all you have credit card statement you paid for it they have it without your permission call the cops now|`|CXh6Seigaa	I don't think you should call the police yet.

If it turns into what seems to be violent acts or robbery, that's when you call the police.|`|ec5e2cfdd5364a1a67d973613c5d9480aa	The short answer: Small Claims Court.  Take all receipts that are remotely connected with the taken property.
glt02wg2aa	True. Plus many other factors.  Just look at Hugo Chavez who came to power on the platform of "Change".  He eliminates any media that dare speak against him.  He makes alliances with Iran & Russia to build a modern army - this .ensures ability to supress competition.  He wants to change the Venezuelan Constitution - so he can be president for life.

Unfortunately, for the Republicans and bankers and oil companies it started to fall apart before the new administration was in office to take the blame.  So now the Republicans are trying so hard to blame it on the new administration that they don't see that the "public" is no longer being fooled.  The blame is falling right on the Republicans and their big business cronies.
AA10690306	No, and I am ready for times to get tough.  Four years ago I started reading the signs and getting prepared.  The signs were all there all anyone had to do was set something aside for what is coming.  Some of us did years ago.      Oh, and contrary to what the Republicans are saying this mess had nothing to do with the Democrats it was started in 2001 and planned to happen in 2009.  Unfortunately for the Republicans it happened 8 months too soon.

It is certainly ironic that Republicans want to expand the role of Fannie and Freddie in this way, but thank God they have stopped just saying no to everything but a certain type of tax cut.

If they forgot to renew the insurance and they get pulled over, they are really going to be angry when they find out that you knew the insurance was expired all the time.|`|wMZRXZFLaa	Best thing you can do is tell your parents what happened (that you got pulled over) instead of working your tail off to hide it.  They will find out eventually, one way or another.  When you do tell them, let them know you got a ticket for expired insurance.  It could be that they forgot to mail off the renewal payment and it lapsed.  I am not sure if you do have a way out, but you will have to prove that you have valid insurance later on.  This really needs to be cleared up.  If you had an accident, not only would your vehicle not be covered but it also makes you liable for the entire amount to not only repair the other car involved but the person's medical bills should they have to go to the hospital.  No way out of it either.  Continuing to drive without insurance is a time bomb waiting to explode in your face.  Get your parents to fix this tomorrow and DO NOT DRIVE until your parents do get this fixed.|`|dTaBXqjyaa	ok BE VERY WISE right now okay. this could mess you up A LOT!    Heres what you do, choose an option;    1. You are under your parents insurance and your insurance CARD was expired but the car was STILL INSURED.  2. you WERE under your parents insurance but you NO LONGER ARE.    be very careful, if the car was NOT INSURED AT ALL ANYMORE then pay the $65 ticket it will not affect any future insurance premium and your parents will not find out.    Now if the car was currently insured but you have the expired insurance CARD, then take the ticket to the civic centre with the NEW insurance CARD and speak to the justice of the peace and the ticket will be dropped.    you DO NOT want to end up with a $5000 fine for driving without insurance, trust me on this one.

eulMjLtPaa	First of all, "people" are wrong; the police almost always show up.      "Everyone else was doing it" is not a defense.

glt02wg2aa	The greatest concern is if the Mullahs forcibly take over again and drag the people back into the seventh century.  Ie: Al Sadar.  Everything will depend on the people of Iraq - if they want to fight for their news freedoms or vote for 'change' = back to the Sharia Law and Mullah rule.

The best thing to do though is to make sure she doesn't move so far away where it's to difficult for you to be with your kids. Get an attorney if she's trying to make things hard. If it's just across town or a few blocks away you're worrying over nothing.|`|KlGLSJruaa	She has the right to move but probably within the state (or maybe city).  Those rights are temporary, so if she moves, he returns once the court restores your custody of him.  If the courts given away your parental rights, it is in your best interest to take care of whatever had him removed in the first place.  Concentrate on that for the time being.  She's probably angry at you for putting her in the position in the first place, but you can redeem yourself.  :)
ohafdshKaa	It varies quite a bit.  Your leave date is determined by what job you pick.  Basic Training at Jackson starts a new batch on an almost weekly basis, But your training date for your MOS depends on how long that school is.  Essentially, they will see when the first available start date for your MOS is and send you to Basic two months before that.  So the only way to know is go sign up.  If the Army's what you want to do then go for it, it sucks sometimes but is AWESOME FUN most of the time.|`|htaxf1jJaa	it depends. my brother enlisted for the Marines and left for boot a couple months after he enlisted. my 'boyfriend' enlisted for the Air Force around September and he left for basic January 5th.

AA11494150	Traffic laws are "strict liability". This means knowledge of the violation does not have to be established. The officer only needs to prove you were speeding, he does not have to prove you knew what your speed was.     For that reason, any comments you made, or his entry about your comments, will make little difference.|`|Cv7TWRhyaa	In order to be convicted, the court must find beyond a reasonable doubt that you are guilty of the offense.   It is NOT strict liability; strict liability is a completely different civil legal doctrine.    One wants to stall and delay.       When the court date comes, go and get the clerk to give you a counter extension ("continued arraignment").     Then do another extension.  Waive right to speedy trial.     When it's finally set for trial, the case will be so old, cop:     1) Will lose the ticket as so many months went by;  2) Not have independent recollection of the case by the time it come to trial;  3)  In most states, cannot stop one from still asking for traffic school in the event he or she is ultimately convicted.    If cop testifies, make sure you have any witnesses who were present when the officer stopped you for speeding.    Consider subpoenaing any taped (audio or visual) recordings of the incident, plus his speed documents as follows:    1. Any and all information and documentation relating to the arresting officers training and experience in the area of speed detection utilizing laser principles in general.     2. Any and all information and documentation (i.e. log sheets, etc.) relating to the arresting officers training and experience using the same model of laser which was used in determining the Defendants speed.    3. Any and all information and documentation (i.e. log sheets, etc.) relating to the arresting officers training and experience using traffic speed measuring devices other than the type or model which was used in determining the Defendants speed.    4. Any information and all documentation relating to the arresting officers training and experience (i.e. log sheets, etc.) using the exact laser unit which was used in determining the Defendants speed.    5. The arresting officers certification on the specific laser unit used to determine the Defendants speed.    6. Information, including documentation if available, showing what time(s) that day the officer tested the laser for proper functioning both before and after the Defendant was stopped.  What steps did the arresting officer follow in conducting said tests.  What results did the arresting officer achieve.    7. Certificates by the Colorado Department of Agriculture, the National Bureau of Standards, or other certified agency showing that the laser used in this case were certified on the date of the Defendants citation.    8. The arresting officers log sheet for laser calibrations and laser use on the day of the citation to show that the laser was operating properly over time.    9. Information indicating whether the arresting officer was operating any other instrument which could have produced interference at the time he was calibrating or using the laser to determine the Defendants speed.     10. Documentation (i.e. log sheets, training records, etc.) to corroborate the arresting officers visual observation of speed at increments of 5 mph and 10 mph over the posted speed limit if the prosecution intends to elicit such an opinion at trial.     11. Any and all information and documentation relating to any repairs done on the laser unit used in this case both before and after the date of the Defendants citation.    12. Certificates showing any calibration instruments were certified on the date of the stop.    13. Any and all information and documentation relating to the age and any damage to the laser unit and any calibration instruments used in this case.    14. What knowledge did the arresting officer have as to whether the calibration instruments used were properly calibrated, certified and functioning at the time that the Defendants speed was determined.    15. Any and all information and documentation to show that the calibration instruments used in this case were either supplied by the laser manufacturer or were compatible with the particular device used in the Defendants case.    16. Any and all information and documentation relating to the method(s) used by the arresting officer in determining whether the laser unit and calibration instruments were functioning accurately at the time the citation was issued to the Defendant.    17.

eY0MhGfmaa	No, the insurance company doesn't "give her what she's already paid on her vehicle", they reimburse the leasing company for the fair market value of the lost vehicle - minus her deductible.

Now she's out of a car and it clearly wasn't her fault.    Not buying any of this - they maybe made an initial estimate in one business day but they didn't close the case.    She needs to check the terms of her coverage. If she is not covered for uninsured drivers, hit/run, collision, etc., then why would the insurance company pay for it? If she is, then the policy also has terms describing how to follow up from here.    anyway, her car is a lease - she needs to return the car in a certain condition, that isn't going to happen now. So the lease probably has terms to describe what the lease company expects too. Paying off the lease is the least of her concerns financially I bet      anyway again, if she is paying the deductible, then they are going to repair the car, not total it.    like I said, it is far from clear you understand the situation and have not conveyed it clearly to us as a result.|`|811316351e4db28757d4b5a70c9e6a87aa	MAN___ If I was her I'd make sure that ins co Never forgets ME!!!!     1st Call the better business bearu  Call the state attourney general.

Second she is not the owner of the car ( the leasing co. is) so she is not entitled to any compensation for the loss of the vehicle.If the car is totaled the blue book value fo that make year and model car will be paid to the leasing company. That money minus her deductible which she will be responsible for will be paid to the leasing company.  If she and or her passenger have injuries that require medical attention she is eligible for compensation and the insurance company should have that liability.  Hops this helps.
JDltTREfaa	Believe it or not, police agencies aren't actually looking to hire a total goody two shoes who has never done anything wrong.  Those folks are certainly fine upstanding members of society but they generally have ZERO street smarts (which is an important quality for any successful peace officer).  Police departments can't afford to hire men and women who are naive.  But to develop street smarts usually requires some youthful indiscretions. A significant percentage of law enforcement applicants admit to using marijuana.  As long as they are honest about their use, marijuana does not prevent someone from becoming a police officer as long a they have been clean for a period of time.  (And any deception detected during the polygraph exam would eliminate your chances of getting hired - so honesty is the best policy.)    One year of being clean usually isn't a long enough period of time to demonstrate to a police department that your marijuana use is in the past.  Usually four years is the cut-off point.  Many agencies don't hire applicants under the age of 25, though, so as long as you stay clean and make absolutely certain that you maintain good credit (yes - good credit is an absolute requirement for law enforcement applicants.  If you have bad credit you don't have a prayer of getting hired.) your marijuana use shouldn't cause you any trouble.|`|emNCaAq7aa	Some are, some aren't. Some give lie boxes and still don't care if you used in the past as long as you answer honestly, some don't give lie boxes but care if you used.  No convictions is very good, no arrests is even better. The trend is no cannabis use in the past 5 years is OK, but you can find departments all over the place on past drug use. It does not hurt to simply ask a recruiter in the department you plan on going out for.  No department will hire if you pee hot for anything.|`|qhdhva5Daa	Will you be willing to arrest people for smoking pot?

People at that age do stupid things and we most of the time learn our lesson, they know that too so I'm sure you will be ok.  Good luck!
S3ktbzDNaa	Yes there are. I'm not saying they're correct, but there is a reason they are able to make the argument.    1929 levels in 1936 represents 7 years of zero growth, with very hard times in between. It wouldn't have seemed that impressive. Impressive enough compared to the previous president to vote FDR back in and keep him wildly popular, but not exactly ending the depression.    The depression really ended with WWII due to the military industrial complex. This is a point often used to show that FDR's policies didn't end it.    However, there are counterpoints to these arguments. The magnitude of what FDR faced made getting to zero growth 7 years in was pretty damn impressive and he continued to make improvements. Also, he didn't go nearly as far with his policies as he should have. John Maynard Keynes, the greatest economist of the 20th century, argued that FDR should have done considerably more deficit spending. FDR responded that Keynes spoke to him as though he had a degree in economics with too many numbers and didn't understand politics. If FDR had listened to Keynes more fully, the depression may have ended sooner.    The reason the war got us out of the depression is because the war functioned as the new deal deficit spending policy on steroids, the government suddenly filled the entire gap left by the private sector, rather than just a portion of it during the 1930's. Once people had enough jobs to afford to buy things, the private sector was able to take over for the government. We had another little recession after the war ended and the government jobs dried up, but it was minor compared to what we faced before the war.    Note that Keynes didn't worry about inflation. It wasn't recognized as significant until after economists analyzed the situation in Germany in the 1930's when they started madly printing money. It's not a major issue during a depression unless you print money as rampantly and stupidly as Germany did. Modern Keynesian economics is tempered by inflation concerns and referred to as "neo-Keynesian".|`|AA12191521	Every history book ever written says the new deal did nothing to end the great depression. WW2 ended the depression. Stop trying to revise history to promote your failed ideology.     In 1939 we started selling war supplies to Britain. This put a bit of growth into the economy before we entered the war, but it was still war spending.    There are lies, damned lies, and statistics.    there was a brief plateau in 36 and 37 when the economy almost reached the level of 7 years before. Then it bottomed out again and didn't come back up until the lend-lease program was started in ww2. Statistics can say anything you want them to say if you cherry pick your data points.

And WW II didn't start until December of that year. But it wasn't all New Deal programs, increased defense spending beginning in 1940 also helped lower the unemployment rate, but basically, by Pearl Harbor, the economy was back on track and in full recovery mode.|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	Where exactly did you get you degree in economics?   Now if you or anyone would like the opinion of a real economist, you can get there here: http://www.amityshlaes.com/|`|XwtmNIMOaa	This is a common republican talking point.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	1. Actually, within 6 months after the Wall Street Crash, the unemployment numbers started moving up, because the natural recovery didn't need any help. But then Hoover, who believed in big government, signed Smoot-Hawley into law, creating an international trade war. And he tried to keep wages up during the ensuring deflationary period. It was his actions, not his inaction, that was the problem.    2. You can talk numbers outside of context all you want, but the fact was that unemployment remained unacceptably high, well over 10% and even exceeding 20% well into FDR's 2nd term. FDR was still campaigning in "hoovervilles" for his 2nd term.     3 See 2. above.    So, your first point is an outright lie (gee, what a surprise) and your second and third points are very narrowly selected cherry-picked numbers, without context, to support your view. It's a crock of sheet.    Too bad no respected economists agree with you.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	Me. The war ended it.

Edit: To Rich B. Then why havent Iraq and Afghanistan did the same thing?|`|zjpB2GARaa	Of course, the New Deal did not end the Depression.  It made it far worse.    Herbert Hoover started the New Deal (which was based upon Benito Mussolini's fascist economic policies; yes, fascism was actually the name of a type of economic policy, an economic policy very similar to what is advocated by today's Democrats and by unprincipled "moderate" Republicans such as Bush and McCain), wrecking the economy (just as Bush started the New New Deal).  FDR ran on a limited government platform, then flip-flopped and escalated Hoover's failed policies.  The economy worsened.  It did not recover until after WWII when the government cut back to a smaller level than it had been prior to the war (due to massive opposition to the big government policies of the Truman Administration by the American people and the Republican Congress they elected in 1946).    If you believe government economic statistics accurately reflect the strength of the economy, then you should look at 1946.  During that year, the GDP slipped by a record amount (due to drastic cuts in government spending, which is erroneously counted as production instead of expenditure in the GDP statistics), but prosperity returned.    A government make-work job is not a productive job that improves the economy.  It actually crowds out productive private sector jobs.  This is a classic example of the Broken Window fallacy.    Of course, it is absurd to believe that government can create wealth.  The government must fund everything it does in 1 of 3 ways.  It must either tax people, print new money out of thin air, or borrow money.  All 3 of these have bad effects on the economy.  Taxing the poor and middle class impoverishes people.  Taxing the wealthy destroys the very thing that creates wealth, the accumulation of capital.  Printing money out of thin air causes inflation and can cause hyperinflation if too much money is printed, destroying a currency.  Borrowing money merely passes the responsibility for paying the debts off to future generations (as the pro-Nazi leftist pseudo-economist John Maynard Keynes said, "in the long run, we're all dead").    If you want an economic recovery, the solution is limited government, sound money, and the elimination of the bipartisan American Empire.|`|1TJ5v6Xzaa	You left out a huge chunk of history out, WWI.  It was the war that got production and manufacturing going again.  People were still broke in the New Deal.  When the war started, the government start paying companies to change their tooling and start making weapons, tanks, ammunition, etc.    Back then, the government isn't as broke as it now, they actually had big cash reserves.  Today, the government pays for the things today by pushing the bill off into the future and print money to cover costs.  That is there is nothing in the social security fund but a pot of IOU's.

AA11206283	how did they fail to protect YOUR information?|`|7ONKVbbiaa	NO. The law specifically has to do with who a doctor is allowed / not allowed to give information to. The information was legally given to the patient, and the doctor did not release it to anyone (nor did the dr cause the person to lose it).   I can legally tell anyone I want, regarding my medical history, etc. It is about who the Dr. can tell. He has not broken any law above.
9tcv3TiWaa	You don't choose the mover and book it, the military will do it all for you.  When you are doing a PCS move. If it is you moving home while he is on deployment or something similar they will not pay for it.    If you hire a moving company yourself then it can be out of your own pocket as not all companies are approved by the military.    The AD member talks to Transportation and requests date for the move, the moving company contacts you with the date they have available.  They come and pack it up, put it in the truck and then move it to the next location.      There is a set weight allowance for his Rank w/dependents on accompanied orders. it is a decent  amount that you should not have problems being less than.      If they break or lose anything then it is insured and will be replaced/money given for it, if you file a claim within the set time limit. They do pack everything well, we have never had a problem.|`|2zhQznahaa	If you go to the Housing office where he *is* STATIONED, you can inquire to them, fill some paperwork out, and have them take care of everything, and the movers will come to you and 99.8% of the time they pack the items themselves.  Like pack them into peanut foam boxes and all that.  But thats on a tangent.   You have to get either there right in person, or get on their hotline during duty hours.  Like 8:00 to 1700 or 1800.

It is part of the deal they move you for free. The amount you are allowed to move is based on his rank. The lower the rank the less he is allowed to move. There is a place that's called the transportation management office that does it.
PI8VfiY1aa	That's quite a lot to ask for. I will do it, but you must promise me that you will stop typing like that??

41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	Depending on the condition , probably nothing. especially since you are Guard.   But then again that depends too on your command.      SFC   US Army  Retired|`|2zhQznahaa	You always gamble that risk.  But I won't advise you either way.  Best way in your longshot, according to morals, is tell the truth.  If you tell them on the physical when you are about to be terminated that you used crystal meth prior to joining the army, and didn't disclose it to them when recruiting, I know a man who didn't get in trouble that time, But it all depends on how screwed up your Judge Advocate at the place is that your unit is.  If they're backlogged then thay'll have a bad effort in prosecuting you, and they might not prosecute it.  But you could well end up getting a stop loss, (in one scenerio i know a soldier who got a stop loss b/c of Uniformed code of Military Justice ongoing investigation into him traficking Ecstacy).  But I dont think that all in all, in a nation thats at war, that they have the time and resources to stop loss you over such a small thing, whereas saying that your case is like the 'E' traficking case is much like comparing apples to oranges.  So your chances and predicament is mitigated.  Next time you enlist or make a big decision just tell the truth, there are plenty of job opportunities on-line, besides the military, if they deny you based on pre-requisites.  But then again, i can see empathy in your situation, if it was over something so small.  You could always use your noggen, and not tell the NG about your medical ailment, and if its something so big that you think youre going to have to get medical treatment from the VA for it, you could always go to France or Canada or somewhere with a nice healthcare, and just get your condition fixed with some medication.  (Frances health care process is free for even tourists).  So Blah!  Dont think youre just going to tell the Guard abot your med. condition just to go and get yourself seen at VA, because they'll never have it.  It takes like 20 forms even to get into a medical board chart anyways, and they'll know that it was formed b4 you served, and you will get served, or told off.      B/C I DONT KNOW WHY you are contemplating telling the NG about it, if not to claim that you need help for it and medication when you are d/xed.  Why are you thinking about telling them? Thats why I mention just using another health care system, or something. U might even be able to treat it with herbal supplements or something.

emNCaAq7aa	1st if you take something not from a person's immediate control but you just broke in to a business or home it is not robbery, this is good since what it is, burglary, is a lesser charge.  It does not make much difference why you broke in. First offense in my jurisdiction you would get probation. (You could get up to 3 years in the penitentiary)  You could plead guilty at your first court hearing, the day after you are arrested and spend no time in a real jail.  Perhaps in a small town your sob story would make a difference, at least to the press. Which is good because they do not hand out probation as easily.  In my area no one would care why you did it, they would just give you probation and tell you to sin no more.  I know nothing about Canadian laws or practices.

Ultimately, the Nazis sought to create a largely homogeneous and autarkic ethnic state, absorbing the ideas of Pan-Germanism.
7e6ZjOqiaa	yes he does, why does every republican try to put him down?  he's working hard to make up for GB's mistakes|`|E9XL5x3Paa	The point of the stimulus is not spending.    You guys really should learn to start reading between the lines. Obama is actually working for what Republicans want, but in a way that actually works.    Obama knows that kind of spending would never be approved, but then its not supposed to be approved. The idea is to increase confidence in us.      Look, Democrats are supposed to initiate this by bringing the bill forward, making them look good when they see that the situation is dire enough to require action. That increases their support among their constituents.    Then the Republicans are supposed to take away that pork you are complaining about, when they object to the spending. That makes them look good when it shows them as being financially restrained again, bringing their constituents back behind them.    Then they get the new bill, free of the pork, before Congress again. They vote, with a huge majority from both sides. Then we gain confidence in the government and in the economy when we see them working together. That we know they play games with each other, but that they know when to stop playing games and can get serious about really working together when the situation calls for it. They work together, and then we gain that confidence.    And even before any spending is done, our confidence level moves up and that convinces customers to start buying again, investors to start investing again, and businesses to start hiring again. Without any spending, and moving toward a private sector solution (restoring confidence so we do this ourselves), the whole thing is saved.          Only problem is, Republicans are not playing their part. Now a huge part of that is Nancy Pelosi, who got screwed when Republicans were in charge and now intends to return in kind. But Republicans are not helping anything when they throw their little temper tantrum about Pelosi and then refuse to do anything but complain.    It also isn't helping that Republicans are trying to ADD spending to the bill. That wasn't what Obama was wanting them to do nor expecting them to do, and that definitely shouldn't be what they are doing.    Notice that when they complain about too much spending, Obama takes that part OUT of the bill. But when Republicans try to add to the bill, he steps in the way. To anyone paying attention, you can see what Obama is trying to do. He needs Republican voters on board with this so they can get some confidence, too. They are customers, business owners, and investors just like Democrats. We need everyone gaining confidence, but it doesn't work if Republican Senators and Congressmen don't play their part.    They have to start cutting out the pork, as was their role when this plan began. But they keep wanting to add to the pork instead, replacing the current pork with pork of their own. That isn't what Obama wants, and sure as h*ll not what we need.    Republicans need to do what they have said they would do, which is CUT the pork, not replace it with more of their own. Nancy Pelosi needs to get over herself.     This plan can work, Nancy Pelosi and the Republicans just need to pull their sh*t together. And Republicans need to start acting like actual Conservatives, and start cutting instead of adding.    ______________________________________...      My answer to a different question, which is why it does not fit exactly to yours.    But it's basically to get across that Obama appears to be the only one who knows what he is doing, working with those who'd rather fight it out than pay attention.    It's like a game of poker or chess.  Obama is looking at the whole board, paying attention to every card played.  But he is dealing with rather selfish individuals who'd rather screw themselves to screw each other, then actually get anything done.|`|49491d4026350f4de724cb49c3744085aa	you are not alone.|`|ZxtEh7yZaa	God have mercy on us!|`|9HvHmwTNaa	he never did....he has been following a written script prepared by writers for 4 years...so far he has attempted to play the part of Lincoln, Roosevelt, Kennedy, Regan,   right now he is doing a pretty good impression of more of the same ....my guess is the next part he will play is that of his original role he played in the senate......Present|`|7cc078f55da409c4d9b845dbc7c568daaa	he does not.. his economic advise is so bad...|`|gnABxaKmaa	Of course he know what his doing...

If Daschle were a Republican or a Conservative, he would be facing a whole different response to this problem.  If you are in charge and are supposed to be a "representative of the law" of how government should work, then you owe it to the public to be honest and if you aren't, you should be rejected for the position.

kPG2g4iSaa	An academy appointment nets the awardee a full ride scholarship, room and board, and a monthly salary equal to 1/2 the monthly salary of an O-1 (1/2 monthly salary of an O-1 is currently $1327.65).

0PWkMoIraa	The surrender of Japan in August 1945 brought World War II to a close. On August 10, 1945, after the invasion of Manchuria by the Soviet Union and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States, Japan's leaders at the Supreme War Council (the "big six") decided, in principle, to accept the terms the Allies had set down for ending the war in the Potsdam Declaration. It was after several more days of behind-the-scenes negotiations and a failed coup d'tat that Emperor Hirohito gave a radio address to the nation, The Imperial Rescript on Surrender, announcing the acceptance, on August 15. On August 28, occupation of Japan by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers began. On September 2, the Japanese government signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, which officially ended World War II. Some isolated commands of Japan's far-flung forces throughout Asia and the Pacific islands refused to surrender for months and years after, up into the 1970s|`|NZ4iWM9maa	the japanese surrendered on the deck of the USS battleship Missouri i believe it was docked in tokyo harbor but may have been docked at the main jap naval base of Kure
3pK4Gn6Kaa	The intent was to limit the power of the Federal Govt to only those powers listed in the Constitution and the states and people would have the power over all other things.      The Tenth Amendment was intended to confirm the understanding  of the people at the time the Constitution was adopted,  that powers not granted to the United States were reserved to the  States or to the people. It added nothing to the instrument as originally  ratified.      That quote comes from a fairly good article about the 10th.

Is this industry like the big three automakers?    Is the porn industry a victim of the global financial crisis. Wall Street has been bailed out, so why not the U.S. porn industry?

This comes after Flynt, who thumbed his nose at the government for years and waged battles, one of which was him wearing the United States Flag as a diaper, which resulted in Flynt being fined and jailed for the incident that was captured by the media at large. The number of press working the case in Cincinnati was quadrupled   Flynt has spent years in litigation, fighting the government, since 1972 when Flynt started Hustler magazine, as a 4 page magazine that promoted not only his clubs but an inner racial couple. Which brought Flynt more trouble than he expected.  While entering Court in 1978 Flynt was shot by  white supremacist Joseph Paul Franklin, which left Flynt in a wheelchair unable to walk, as a result.   Flynt has spent years in litigation on both sides of the aisle, as a defendant and a victim.  There needs to be a limitation to who can apply and receive benefits under the federal bailout money, why should we allow industries like this one receive federal bailout money, after waging war, and mocking and scoffing the government as a whole.  As far as I'm concerned the whole porn industry could go bankrupt, and stop making movies, that degrade women. Flynt needs to close shop instead of thinking that Obama will come to the rescue,with a substantial bailout proposal while more people loose their homes and jobs. While CEOs and Upper management of these companies make more money.|`|lHDff8Braa	The porn industry employs a LOT of people, more than we'll ever know, and probably including one or two people in your own neighborhood.

AA11124254	The 14th Amendment intended to bring full citizenship to any person born or naturalized in the U.S. (slaves), however the due process clause in the Amendment is the major part of writ.  This applied the Bill of Rights to all citizens of every state, not just when dealing with the Federal Government.  The effect was that it caused Federal law to override state law in certain situations.    The 16th Amendment allowed Congress to levy taxes in whatever way it deemed necessary without consulting the states (Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration).  This denied the states the ability to protect its citizens and to dismiss the taxes of the federal government.    The 17th Amendment took away the power of the states to select representation in Washington D.C.  The founding fathers had envisioned a bicameral legislation where the people were represented by 1 house (the House of Representatives) and where the States could have representation (The Senate) ensuring that we did not become a democracy.      The founding fathers despised democracy as it is merely mob rule, and preferred a country ran by the rule of law (a representative democracy).  This would be the perfect balance of a Monarchy and a Democracy (notice how in the Constitution the states are referred to as the "several states"?  They were emphasizing that the states are separate governments joined by a common government instead of smaller parts of a large government.  The amendments that you listed reversed this philosophy.|`|5Ho518J9aa	In all three cases the States lost their Sovereignty. Before the 14th, unless your Parents were American Citizens, you needed to take the oath. There were no "anchor babies" draining the States coffers, because if you weren't a citizen, you got NOTHING! Before 16th, the only means of Federal Revenue were stiff tariffs on imported goods. Personal income taxes were supposed to be temporary, and they were to pay for the buildup to WWI. They never had any intention of repealing them. The 17th came about because the State Governors had to appoint them, so it didn't cost millions to run  for the Senate. It was a State's Representative, not the People's. My, how things have changed. Look up how many states are in default.
loy04C98aa	The Voting Rights Act of 1965 gave all adults the right to vote without encumbrance and forced states to provide the means to allow all legal adults the ability to do so.      This act was signed into law by Lydon B Johnson after a summer that started with Bloody Sunday in March of 1965.    There is currently a case before the Supreme Court, scheduled to be heard, I think in April, that is seeking to overturn one of the most critical sections of the Act, Section 5.  This section requires specific States and Districts known for their disingenuous acts of voter racial discrimination to file and have approved by the Justice Department any change to their voting procedures.  Those states are as follows:    Alabama  Alaska  Arizona  Georgia  Louisiana  Mississippi  South Carolina  Texas  Virginia    For the complete list of other districts covered, see the second link in the source file.    In 1982 Congress extended this section for 25 more years after careful review of the section and the behavior of the covered states and districts.    In 2006 Congress again extended this section for another 25 years for the same reason.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	We should add Florida and Ohio to that list.

Morons like you are the ones who lose elections for your own side. I thought it was mostly Republicans, but there are really stupid Liberals as well, as you do a lot to prove here.     However, you failed in the most important part....where is the link to Rumsfeld in all of this gibberish?|`|5ZfcMc34aa	I see a pile of cut and paste with absolutely NOTHING to link it to Rumsfeld, the FDA, a conspiracy or planet earth for that matter.|`|45cb74f9b5bb495b15a6f3f0a1d5c694aa	You are correct in nearly everything you posted, however your time-line is incorrect.    Rumsfeld was the head of Searle Drug when it applied for FDA approval of nutrasweet/aspartame/ which is basically an enzyme known as phenylalanine.  Phenylalanine is an enzyme our bodies produce naturally and as such there is no blood/brain barrier, which means that it can go directly into the brain & bloodstream and effect moods.    Reagan was President when it was approved by the FDA.  At the time there was NO HEAD of the FDA.  It was approved with NO testing.  It is a major cause of Parkinsons, PMS, mood disorders, weight gain (ironically) and numerous other human illnesses.  There is still some controversy about it turning to methanol, in relation to the Gulf War Syndrome - which has now been nearly 100% proven to be caused by the use of depleted uranium by George HW Bush in the first war in Iraq.    So, you are mostly correct, but need further research.    The most heinous part of this episode is that the chemical antidote to too much phenylalanine is Prozac, and guess who made money off of that too?    And if that isn't enough, Searle Drug was purchased by Montsanto prior to nutrasweet being approved.      You people can doubt it all you want, but there is an undeniable pedigree on all of this.  Just Google it.  Our drug companies do not make drugs that will make us well, they make drugs to treat the illness.  That's how they make money, people.  Any small wonder that these same weasels wanted stem cell research stopped?  There were numerous studies that had shown a cure for diabetes via stem cell treatment.  The  1 moneymaker for drug companies?.........diabetes treatment.  Jesus, get a clue, western medicine is not your friend.
Qou0CLwiaa	Ideas can not be patented.    Specific implementations of unique inventions can be.    Generally, that is the underlying "special sauce" of a web site, not the web site content itself/ E.g Priceline's bidding model, or Amazon's 1 click pay.    This is a complex area of law, and it is not clear that even if something is patentable, that it should be protected that way, because patents require disclosure at a certain point, while trade secrets don't.    Business plans need to take all this and more into account, otherwise you would just be wasting time and money on a vanity project when the money can be spent better promoting or improving the web site.|`|AA11622716	No. Ideas cannot be patented.  Programs can be protected, as can the original website under copyrite, but that only protects against copying, not against using the same idea.
QIQNzE11aa	Actually all those things you listed would be unethical.     Unethical is - not conforming to approved standards of social or professional behavior; "unethical business practices"     that's out of the dictionary. So what you asked would mean it was unethical as it means they are not conforming to the standard and social practices of this country.     Now, immoral is - violating moral principles; not conforming to the patterns of conduct usually accepted or established as consistent with principles of personal and social ethics.    Morality is based upon self and some common social beliefs. Morality is far more about what you believe. If you believe those items to be moral, and going against the laws of your society, then yes, they coudl be seen as immoral.     The city may fine you if you do not plant the treets as the city requested.|`|sVbZEWveaa	Some laws are based on morality and breaking those laws is immoral but other laws are man made and even though some we should not break they are not immoral or maybe even unethical. There are some laws out there that are immoral and unethical but still you should not break it because its still a law.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Most laws are based on one sides perception of morality. Is it wrong to break them? I don't think so.. It depends on which laws though.   We all break laws at some time or another and many aren't worth the paper they're written on.  I see nothing wrong with breaking certain laws because of your deep held beliefs, but others you just have to go along with because prison is no fun..|`|kPWGVeWhaa	Interesting question.      Some are moraly wrong like you listed...murder, rape, theft...stuff like that.    But some like drugs and drinking are a personal thing.  Wont really hurt anyone else.      Tree planting thing does effect others though.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	The real question is how do you define ethics and morals?  Ethics are generally a set of accepted behaviors in your community.  Morals go a bit beyond ethics to include your acceptance of what is right and wrong in human behavior.  I would say that all illegal activities would be unethical simply because they go against what the society has determined to be acceptable behavior.  Some of those behaviors may not be immoral, because they may not be either right or wrong, just simply what your society as decided to have as a convention.  The city tress are a good example.  Planting or not planting in one place or the other is neither right nor wrong.  However, because your city may have an ordinance about how far back from the street the tree may be, or whether you have the right to remove or replace the tree, makes it legal/illegal and therefore ethical/unethical.  Sleeping with (having sex) with someone that is not your spouse may not be illegal but it certainly is immoral by the general standards of right and wrong accepted by our society as a whole.  Morality has a greater religious connotation.

Then they said publicly and very non apologetically to F the system and the Laws, citing " we were drunk." Also we were sorry."  Was it not Shakespear, "Much Ado About Nothing", that two guards were talking and one said to the other, I Think that prisoner in xx said he was sorry and he means it, the other guarg replied, "The only reason he is sorry, is that he got caught."  Pardon me, but; does that excuse your behavior? You were drunk.  Good thing they only got 3 mo, could have seen a longer community service, like for one year.
8ad6fQiNaa	Yes it should be legalized. America is supposed to be a country based on personal freedoms. If I want to put marijuna into my body, why should anyone else tell me that I can't? It's not worse than nicotine (cigarettes), caffeine, or alcohol. Yes there will be people who abuse it, but people abuse all forms of substances, why should my rights be revoked because of their mistakes?        Aside from the moral ideals of infringing on my rights, there's the simple economic argument. If we legalized it, we could create a whole new job sector. People would need to grow and harvest it, cure it, roll it, then distribute it. Imagine doubling the cigarette market. There'd be all kinds of jobs that would need to be filled.        Then you have to look at what it would do to the government. We'd save millions a year that we now spend on trying to stop the trafficking and selling of marijauna. We'd save money on housing criminals that were caught dealing it. We could tax it, making even more money.         So if we legalized it, we'd stave off government spending, bring in more tax money, have fewer criminals in jail and create new jobs. Or we can keep it illegal and people will still smoke it, we'll waste money trying to stop them, make no money in taxes, overcrowd our penal system by putting small time dealers in jail with murderers and create no new jobs, all because people are worried that it's a "gateway" drug, just like alcohol.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	No, it's a gateway drug and therefore needs to be illegal. I do however believe in a lower drinking age.|`|dbQHlp85aa	Hmm.. well firstly.. i don't think the gov't will ever leagalize it because it would be close to impossible for them to regulate it. Why buy it at a store and pay tax when you can go to the dude on the corner and get it cheaper?    Secondly, I have to disagree when you say it's not a gateway drug. I had a friend a few years ago.. HUGE STONER!! That was all he ever did and i was teasing him one day about weed being a gateway drug and he said "no man, i'll never do anything else. I love weed and only weed".     Well like 2 years later he started doing coke. I asked him why and he said because weed wasn't doing it for him anymore. He said he would smoke and smoke and nothing would happen so he tried something else. He did say the high was completely different but it was cool.     Then after a while of doing coke he started shooting dope. Then one night his dad found him hunched over in a chair in his room with a needle sticking out of his arm. He was speed-balling and his heart gave out.     He was only 19 and smart as a whip but just wasted his life away.     So, personally I don't think it should be leagalized.. It just makes people stupid. Like years of drinking.|`|cGRcD2xNaa	By making marijuana illegal, it has accomplished that which abolition of slavery created. It serves to keep minority populations in poverty. Look at our prison system, identify what the demographic population is of the prison system and compare the population percentages to the general population of the United States. The truth of the matter stems from the fact that when marijuana was placed under prohibition, it was known that it was used heavily by the black population. Look at the number of black prisoners incarcerated on drug charges vs. the number of white people.    Gateway drug...what is that supposed to be...either a person has addicitve personality traits or not. The true gateway drugs, caffeine and alcohol are much more addictive and abused than any other drugs on the market, either legal or otherwise, and are easier to obtain.  For one to say that they are in favor of lowering the drinking age but maintaining prohibition of pot is laughable and shows a narrow vision of the reality of addiction.    The government SHOULD legalize it. It is our largest cash crop, could be taxed and regulated for the good of the market and by legalizing it, we would actually reduce the amount of crime and the number of people who are incarcerated for petty pot crimes, thus lowering the costs associated with our prison system.|`|HeoS75kGaa	Funny that this question gets asked like very ten minutes in here.  It really doesn't matter what any of us think here.  It's been put to the public vote over and over, and over and over it's been shot down.  Right or wrong, it doesn't matter.  While lots of people see no problem with Pot, others see it as nothing BUT problems.  Right or wrong, it doesn't matter.  There are consistently more people voting against Pot than there are voting for it.    There is no intrinsic American right to smoke Pot.  Actually, there is no intrinsic right to drink booze or smoke tobacco.  But Prohibition turned out to be a flop, and other tactics have taken its place, high prices, product regulation, and ancillary penalties (such as DUI, public intoxication, etc).  Although tobacco has never been outlawed, it's being regulated out of existence.  Used to be, before 1970, that 2/3 of Americans smoked cigarettes,  Now, about 1/3 of Americans smoke cigarettes, and the number is still dropping.  It will get to the point where it's just not economical for the tobacco companies to stay in business.    In time, we will be the healthiest country in the world, dammit, if we have to kill everyone to do it, and we'll be so miserable, we'll kill ourselves just to escape it.  But that's in the future.  In the meantime, we've got laws, taxes, regulations, warnings, superstitions (yes, the 'gateway' drug crap).|`|TgIMUmZPaa	sure, for medical purposes. :)|`|8SdnCGxIaa	no, no drugs should be legal. we have been having this argument for 40 years. Pot is a gateway drug and kills your brain cells.|`|UbXp2K26aa	lol listen to you go. First of all, u need an education on the subject. Second of all, my bf who is in medicine happens to know that pot is in fact just as bad as smoking cigarettes and can give you lung cancer al the time, it's smoke being inhaled. It burns your tissues etc. Third, americans are dumb enough without puffing away at hallucinogenic substances.|`|a5efe275182115a58cc24e44f27eae2baa	I'm from Vancouver - best weed in the world - and I can tell you, that alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana. It is not a gateway drug, but people do tend to overindulge...but the worst potheads I've ever known didn't graduate to heroin or coke. After a few years they realized they were wasting their lives and became motivated to do more with their lives than they otherwise would have...2 are teachers, one works in the civil service and one is a fairly successful author.   Show me the crackheads who are able to get their sh!! together like that.|`|nAKOfHNGaa	Yes i believe it should be legal.......it is not a gateway drug .....alcohol is way worse then pot...i have met many folks who smoke weed and they do nothing illegal besides smoke pot they pay thier taxes go to work everyday and give to charity ....you know any alcoholics or crackheads??? they drive drunk or rob and i have NEVER come across a violent pothead....i think it should be regulated and made legal heck it grows in the wild you dont have to anything to it just like God made it ..........you folks use pharmaceuticals like they are goin out of style and you dont know anything about them but you trust that doc who gets a kickback anyway like a drug dealer on the street for a drug that isnt made for human consumption. POT is natural and has many uses.. u folks just think its bad cause you have been told that your whole life ....everything in moderation is fine alcohol bad.u can smoke a joint and be happy then not have to smoke for days or years its not addictive but take some paxil u are on it for life or you have to be weened off of it you be the judge .....|`|0Gvs8uj4aa	No, I don't think that Marijuana should be legalized. If it were legal, think of how much less productive our society would be. Your probably thinking yeah right I can do all kinds of things like play baskettball or drive a car, or whatever better when I'm high. When was the last time you did your homework high? How'd that turn out for you? Anyway, I used to smoke pot and for me it was a "gateway drug". What's more, I became very addicted to Pot when I was younger. I didn't know it while I was smoking, but then when I stopped, I had real problems with depression and anxiety, both conditions involving imbalances of neurotransmitters such as Serotonin and/or Dopamine, etc. I don't think that cigarettes should be legal either, but the problem is that the big tobacco companies got tons of people hooked years ago. Tobacco industry makes big bucks even if not as much as they once did. People didn't think that there was anything particularly dangerous about tobacco... Now we cannot get rid of it or all the money that it takes to treat people dying from the effects of smoking. I wouldn't be surprised if years down the line, after people had smoked pot everyday for years if we found that chronic exposure to some chemical in pot smoke causes some terrible disease like lung cancer. We can say that there is no evidence that smoking pot causes __________ disease, but the fact is that we don't have enough raw data to say that it is safe. There aren't millions of people coming forward to admit they have smoked pot everyday for 20 years. If it was legal, we would see this, but then it would be too late just like it is for cigarettes.|`|q7mActnmaa	http://www.abovetheinfluence.com/facts/t...    http://www.abovetheinfluence.com/facts/d...    There you decide for yourself.    However I think NOT.
9dEotvVwaa	Because it feels good to think about change and hope, and the same people who want the government to take care of everyone, don't want to take care of anyone themselves.      Oh, and for the one who says you should start giving handouts to homeless people or else you can't criticize, there is a big difference in helping a dying person and giving money to a person standing on the street corner with their hand out.  If a person can stand on a street corner for hours on end then they are able to hold down a job.  McDonald's, Wal-Mart, or any other place that hires unskilled labor.    Have you ever tried standing in one spot for hours on end?  It takes a lot of endurance, and if those people are really in NEED of help, they wouldn't be able to stand there and collect money.|`|a37bfe2a8659dffc78d3a823abe4c79baa	I wonder how 2 million can get into Washington DC in sub zero temps in 1 day when 200,000 couldn't get out of New Orleans at 85 degrees with four days notice....and also what you said.|`|45cb74f9b5bb495b15a6f3f0a1d5c694aa	I agree that it is a rotten thing that someone can die and people can walk by him and ignore him.    Why are you asking this in this category?|`|ITF52tu9aa	Good question. The eye of the media is extremely fickle as is the American public.     Furthermore- this problem is so glaring and so large , many- myself included- look the other way- especially when alms  often merely further the problem (when addiction is the problem).     I agree.|`|avWArdYbaa	So sad.  You should start giving handouts to homeless people, though, if you are going to criticize people for ignoring the issue.|`|edafd0140de689634f039fb1073c9134aa	That is a change, and hope for people I guess. Many of us on the verge to became like this homeless.  Seriously it's very simple to call 911 and they probably pick up this homeless guy in about an hour or two. Will they help him? I don't think so. There so many reports when people dying on the floor in the emergency room and medical staff just walking by without any notion.  And about the Washington. Congress actually starting vote on 800 billions porkuluse (stimulus) plan. I don't know what these 2 millions compare to 800 billions that will be passed on taxpayers. In a while we all will be dying on the streets from hunger, but congress and president still will have their private jets and spend money right and left for nothing but bridges to nowhere.|`|GG7WjH6Raa	how can he change it in one night ?|`|c98cade4acbe9b0e7b822702f53b13ccaa	In response to the homeless person dieing in the streets; they sleep there all day and you expect us to pay enough attention to notice that they are dead, not sleeping; that is a lot to ask. The reason soooooo many folks showed up for the Inauguration was because the people that voted dont have jobs and can take the time to travel. Obama will pay the bills for them anyway right???
Ni8Z3LtQaa	Negative AND Positive. But the cons certainly outweigh the pros in my opinion.     NEGATIVES: We are a breeding-ground for corruption. A capitalist stronghold. A country where the fittest of the fit will survive, and the weak will rot. A country full of intimidation and treachery. A country where the rich pulverize the poor. A nation built on hypocrisy from the very beginning with a constitution that says "all MEN are created equal" when in reality women were, and still are not treated fairly. Not to mention the men who wrote this brilliant document are the same men that had slaves working at their homes......     POSITIVES: Despite the obvious ongoing capitalist crusade of America, and fiery ring of hypocrisy that engulfs this very nation, it IS somewhat a land of opportunity. SOMEWHAT. Compared to many other nations we do have some freedoms. (We CAN burn the American flag on public property, legally). Religion is tolerable, despite our "separation between church and state" that people claim exists....haha, what a joke. THAT'S why prop 8 was passed!     Hopefully President Obama can extinguish the deceit, torture, and downright animalistic attitudes that our past "leaders" have possessed.     Good question man. It's very open-ended.

I went back to school for another degree.  I had to spend money but it helped me get a much better job so it paid off.

That must be BO's plan because this country is never going to get out of debt.|`|KaLd1J0Xaa	I am spenden next monts checkwrit now and I no barrock is gonin to send a stimuluse soon.|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Um... no. that just creates bigger problems... But that is really microeconomics.. where the Government needs to take more of a business approach, not a personal approach.

Why don't those that get the corporate welfare "bailout" money have to do the same thing?|`|a37bfe2a8659dffc78d3a823abe4c79baa	That's not even possible.|`|OLCnQkmBaa	That's a Democratic thing.  People with pride who repay their debts do not do that.|`|7130dcb06a591c8850f1c6de810da84aaa	No. But my wife does.|`|f7a27dc3bf1ef3fa5b6d27e18088be8eaa	No, you don't! One cuts back and does without until the situation is fixed... spending only on the basic necessities......    However the spending it something that both parties have suffered from for a long time now......    Voting for the stimulus package back in October is why I voted independent..... in November    Both McCain and Obama vote yes on the first one.|`|fDuCamMraa	Yes. Then I run to Nazi Pelosi and ask for a handout. But since I don't vote for her, or her clan, she won't give me anything. That doesn't seem like the liberal Democrat way to me!|`|cl9Ghxrlaa	Nope.  It would only put me further in debt because that means I have to borrow from someone or someplace to pay off my original debt.  It would cause me to continue falling in a never ending hole.|`|0s09peMQaa	Yes. I kept being the middle man borrowing money and indirectly making third parties in debt to each other through me.  Not sure if prison time is a laudable goal  though.|`|135587141c574a1880bd4e34dcbdb34caa	If you're trying to compare this to the stimulus, it's apples and oranges.  More like grapes and watermelons the difference between an individual trying to get out of debt, and a government trying to get out of a recession.  The govt. isn't aiming to reduce debt right now.  Cripes.|`|IDDBdU6saa	If you try to spend your way out of it, you'll end up in deeper dept.|`|DY9NOh4taa	Absolutely not, I tighten my belt and pay my bills to avoid being delinquent, there are some who could care less about their situation, and spend regardless of their finances.   Many families are uncertain about the economy, and as such, have tightened their belts and only buying those items that are absolutely necessary.  Japanese autoworkers received additional time off after the holidays, because of the recession, several companies in the US either gave their employees extra time off, or laid off a portion of the workers because of the sluggish economy.        The media reported that the past holiday season, was the worst season that they had seen, since 1969 when data such as this began to be saved and archived for comparison to other years.  Other people are out their maxing out their credit cards and some of them, are only one paycheck away from having their house of cards to come tumbling down.   Losing either their job or home as a result of the recession.

c07v7O80aa	Pay attention when you're briefed on what to do and not do. You will NOT get physically or verbally involved. You will NOT be armed. You will NOT get out of the car unless it's clear that you can. You will be the first to run away if the S**t truly hits the fan, because it's dangerous enough without having to take care of someone else. You will NOT move the patrol car. You may be told to do some of these things by the officer, and then it's okay. Do what you're told and no more and no less. Do not attempt to explain or inform any of the people involved in a call. If all this is not covered in the briefing, ask about it.     ALWAYS know where you are. Every second. Street and block number or cross street. If you have to radio for help because your officer is down, you need to know where the help is needed.  Memorize your officer's unit number.     If there's something you don't get, ask questions. That's why you're there. Very likely, nothing serious will happen.     It does help to know and be known, but not that much from a 40 hour riding stint.|`|2ec2fd99a75713d9a03b10ecc9d7b51caa	Actually my experience on ride alongs contradicts what some have said here. The two departments I have conducted ride alongs with have specifically told me no jeans that the dress is business casual. This would consist of slacks and a polo or button up. So I would go with slacks not jeans, often they can and will disqualify you from a ride along if you are not dressed properly.    Most officers are cool and will brief you on rules. One was strict one had two rules...stay to his left in case he shoots, and listen to him no matter what, if he is being mean, don't take it personally he just needs you to do what he is telling you to. Other than that I was allowed to be fully involved. But the one above is correct in that you want to correspond with anyone at scenes as little as possible you are an observer not a police officer, don't forget that.|`|NTOZ8Q4Aaa	I'd say... don't expect a car chase, a foot chase, a gunfight or any of the stuff that happens on TV. The action you see on television represents a small portion of what police work really is. Jeans and a collar should be fine, but you may want to just ask the Chief before hand, or whoever is coordinating the ridealong. Ask a lot of questions, always keep an eye out where you are and whats going on around you. Just remember that you are an observer and if you are not sure what to do, ask the officer you are assigned to what to do.
fDuCamMraa	No question, you are 100% correct.    Nothing has changed except the people. And the players of this political game are all the same.

Cheating implies that you went into the situation with the intent to deceive but not paying doesn't imply a motive to deceive it flat out says  i just didn't pay my taxes for one reason or another.  He wasn't trying to hide anything so you can't accurately and fairly  call him a cheater.  Absent minded? maybe.    Should he be held accountable for his words and should he be punished by the IRS?  Sure, what you do for one you should be willing to do for all.    Can you really call it change we can believe in if he has been in Federal Government and the Senate for as long as he has been?

Maybe he has learned a lot from all the officials in Illinois who only know corruption is the only answer to a recession precariously sliding to a possible depression.  The Governor of Illinois trying to sell the vacant spot left by Obama was impeached - color him surprised. Blagojevich must have been reading the hand book of corruption from Al Capone.  Look how many years it took the feds to get anything on that mobster and the best they could do was come up with tax evasion.  Poor Abraham Lincoln must be turning over in his grave with the corrupt duplicity of almost all the major elected officials coming out of Illinois. Now Obama gets to appoint like minded officials to keep the press busy while they overlook what he is doing in DC!  If we all cheat on our taxes, I doubt the IRS has enough reserve manpower to catch all of us.  What do you think?

By the way, despite your smear-mongering, Palin is actually a moderate too.  Not as far to the left as John McCain (he is more left-of-center than anything else), but definitely not the right-wing fundamentalist everyone paints her to be.

If they had a clue they would have noticed that Bush campaigned on a fairly moderate basis. That McCain was looking strong in general election terms until his lurch to the right to secure the nomination. That any chance he had went out the window when he picked an extremist like Palin to be his running mate.  Still - why should I complain if they just want to ensure Dems retain control in 2010 and 2012?|`|u93eagkqaa	I hope they pick Palin to run that would trully be the end of that party.|`|reeU4N0eaa	why don't you just admit that she intimidates the crap out of you?|`|e4J0OfjDaa	Yes, I wish everyone in our party was as inarticulate and phony as her, then we could lose EVERY election, which will make it easier to whine about the media and Democrats not giving us a fair chance!|`|ybLErb9caa	I just had to answer this question in response to His Divine Shadow who called Sarah Palin a working class woman    Tell me how many working class women's fortune is worth $1 million?

I'd be for Palin, but Limbaugh is too polarizing, he wouldn't stand a chance.
4TgxrCX4aa	Pork is the most commonly used term to describe tacked on, usually wasteful spending onto otherwise unrelated legislation.  Earmarks allocate dedicated funds to specific projects and have been the preferred method to include pork spending causing to two words to be used interchangeably though they mean different things.  Not all earmarks are pork and not all pork is in earmarks.    The current stimulus bill does not contain any earmarks, but that does not mean it doesn't contain any pork, read this article about the extra spending in the bill and how lawmakers are getting around Obama's ban on earmarks: http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation/s...|`|3caq6SFxaa	Semantics and playing games much like the bipartisanship he shows; right before the vote talk to the Republicans and tell them the support is needed for America but the bill was written completely by Democrats with no input from them.  Semantics and more pork in it then necessary emergency aid.  I really wonder if he knows that he cannot ban earmarks from a bill or cut it out line by line since that is the responsibility of Congress and line item veto was  never passed by Congress and never will for that reason.  Looks like he should worry a bit more about the nuts in hs own party and get them on the same team he is supposedly on.  And Gates was never a Republican in his life-prior to being asked to become SecDef he had been a life long Democrat and changed to independent to not allow either side to play games with his party affiliation and funny how the exact opposite viw point from his first CommSec is a Republican whose replacement will be made by a Democratic governor.  Deals don't count until they are fulfilled and how much pressure will be on the Governor to select a Democrat or independent who will caucus with them.|`|nr96BgWfaa	He meant to say no ear-marks and nothing between the ear-marks.|`|AA11626262	I agree. If the reporter had asked him about that, the conversation would have been far more relevant and truthful.    These nuts and their stimulus package are going to throw so many people under the bus. It's ridiculous. We will keep going down, down, down. Money will be spent like crazy and will continue disappearing like rabbits. More jobs are going to be lost and none will be created. The disastrous outcome of this kind of spending plays so clearly in my mind and it's frightening for our nation.|`|5Ho518J9aa	Mm. It would seem that earmark is too nice of a term for the items contained in the house approved bill. I shudder to think of the economic fallout if even half of these proposed "stimuli" are introduced.

God i hate these jerks do they think we are stupid ?|`|DlQd0m0Daa	It's the same pork, I guess they think that by the action of writing it in the bill vs attaching it and hiding it, makes it OK and not an earmark.

jLxBvXZ5aa	He kept us from being attacked again, and safe.    He lowered taxes, and he called on Congress to make his tax relief permanent, repeal the death tax, and reform the tax code.  Of course this was not done.    He signed CAFTA to level the playing field for U.S. workers, and create new markets for American goods.    He signed a class action reform to curb lawsuit abuse.

Pushed through three raises for our military.  Increased military pay by more than $1 billion a year.    Signed the largest nuclear arms reduction with Russia    Withdrew troops from Bosnia, Germany and the DMZ.    Killed the old US/Soviet union ABM Treaty that was preventing the US from deploying our ABM defenses.    Prohibited putting U.S. troops under U.N. command.

mPNai10Daa	Just my opinion! No one wants someone to come into their home and kick them in their bottom and no one wants the government  to keep secrets. But without some we can be destroyed without a thought. The US people need to make up their minds. The only people who really care if the government hears what they are say is the ones who think that the government care about their personal business. The leaders is not looking for people who is cheating on their partner but people who wish to kill people just because they do not believe the way that do. I do not want you to die. I do not want to die just because I choose to not cover my head. I want all the men and women to just be happen, so ease dropping is needed so be it. That is how they catch people who is do wrong in countries around the world. To say they can not is to say that your life is not worth keeping safe. So, look at it this way if you watch or read news about any person that did not give you permission to see and read about then you are in the wrong as well. Each person have the right to be seen and heard when they want to be seen or heard but the press do not always see it that way. We the people can not change things just because it do not work for one maybe one to two hundreds of thousands but if anyone what to change ease dropping we should start with the freedom of press. The press have helped to destroy any people lives and help make a difference in many ours. Other countries would have never learned our weakness if we the press did not tell them what they were.  And remember we pick the leader of this country good or bad we are just people in the USA. (Just my opinion)|`|ofP7bbX7aa	I don't think he ease dropped on anyone except his wife.|`|9p2wQ21Aaa	YES , people who want to prosecute Bush are crazy,    Actually USA should be prosecuted.|`|SU8Dv2ZAaa	People need to get the **** over themselves; Presidents have been going beyond their boundaries in times of conflicts since the creation of the United States.

Our government workers were TOLD to eavesdrop on personal and private conversations between phones within the US, on journalists lines, intimate conversations between our service members and their spouses.

The reality is this nation has been living on debt during its past 40 years.     Uncle Sam has 13+ trillion dollars of national debt  and average of its citizens owes more than $10000 credit card debt without mentioning all the home mortgate, home equity loans, student loans, car loans, ....    This nation has  been loosing more and more of its manufacturing and high-tech jobs year after year and there is no changing sign in the horizon.     With such reality, only way to survive is to keep borrowing more money from China, Japan, ....      As soon as as those nations stop lending us money,  we all know what kind of life we will be living.    In addition, we can "easily" eliminate our trade deficit by stopping importing foreign oil and all the goods that we sell at Walmarts, Sears, JcPenney. The question will then be "What kind of world will that be?"
a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I'm a Republican.  Bush increased the size of the federal government and spent way too much for non-military things in the last four years.  I was very disappointed.  I don't think that he upheld our Republican belief of spending less and decreasing the size of the federal government.  Debt hurts our country.    I don't think that the first bail out bill should have passed.  While the majority of people who voted for it were Democrats, plenty of Republicans voted for it too---and our Republican president signed it.  Again, it was very disappointing.

This, and a number of other hypocrisies have turned me off to a party I was once loyal to.  I now consider myself an Independent; it's my way of showing my dissatisfaction for BOTH major parties.

The "pork" is basically amounts of money that are delegated to things that will not stimulate the economy.    For instance:  $400 million for global warming research, the $335 million for STD education, the $650 million for digital conversion coupons, the $81 billion for Medicaid, the $20 billion for food stamps, the $30 billion for Cobra insurance extensions, the $4.1 billion for neighborhood activist groups like ACORN, the $83 billion for the earned income credit to give tax refunds to people who dont pay income tax, and the $6 billion to subsidize university building projects.    These have all been put in the stimulus plan, but not a one of them will help our economy.

This may be similar to where you've been finding your info.    I think the republicans are far reaching to say alot of things in the bill are wasteful.  There is definitely some waste.  A majority of the items are fine that they list.  I think some on the list are hypocritical for them to call waste.  I'm all for putting the spending in there that benefits many Americans and doesn't single out small groups or certain cities  If nothing else, some of the amounts can be reduced.    The Republicans are right to think alot of the fat can be cut out, and it should be.  Then you either give the American taxpayers more money or you give them more tax break.  In these rough economic times we shouldn't be overspending.  I'd hate to one day for the American economy be bankrupt and then the US treasury do the same.  If we keep tossing out stimuli over and over again, that's exactly what will happen.|`|AA10075828	OK, I went to the CNN site where the GOPs listed all of the "pork," got out my calculator and added it up. It comes to 18 billion dollars, folks.    EIGHTEEN BILLION OUT OF EIGHT HUNDRED BILLION.    So, I, too, had wondered, but now I see it for myself. Obama is right: That's two percent of the total stimulus package price tag.    Why the heck isn't the media reporting THAT?     Folks, it should worry us--we, the public--that the media, like CNN, knows this and even on the very page where CNN listed all that stuff, they didn't bother to add it up and make the point.    We are being manipulated, people. We are being manipulated in order to for the media to create a story and sell advertising. And we are being manipulated by politicians who would rather get re-elected than get a country back to work.    PLEASE, add it up for yourself. Add up what they are really arguing about, like I did. Do the math and understand why Obama is angry and why this country is f'ed.

Why was this such a problem? Legislation in the early 90s forced lenders to overlook loan applications with credit problems and other payment issues  and  lend to anyone and everyone applying (essentially affirmative action for the economic sector) meaning all across America people were given loans that were dangerous and that if the housing sector ever experience a serious drop in value a large amount of defaults would occur. The free market tried to correct this by waring Washington multiple times throughout the 90s, but their pleas fell on deaf ears leading to ruination of many American banking and loan companies.|`|gJzEAvNTaa	yes honey  and thank you for answer my question earlier    some countries are very good at f**king us with the rules and trends we advocate and impose on the world. as i've said before, careful what you wish for.

Adding a stipulation would entail making an amendment to the contract prior to its intended execution, the marriage itself.  If the marriage has already taken place, then it is too late to amend the prenuptial agreement because the nuptials are already in the past.  At that point, the new agreement would be called a postnuptial agreement.  In either case, a local family law attorney should be able to assist you.  If you want to try it on your own, then go to your local legal bookstore and ask for the section from Nolo Press.  They have some very fine do it yourself books on just about every subject.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	If you want a pre-nup that can be enforced, you better have an attorney draw it up that specializes in such things in your jurisdiction.|`|QIQNzE11aa	You cannot add stipulations once the thing is signed and you are married. Pre marriage is what the prenuptial stands for.

Obama paid his female campaign staffers less than his male campaign workers.|`|6kCws524aa	Contrae, women really are over paid for the amount of work they do. In every instance they have special work rules so that they really never do the exact same work.|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	From what I see, women already make as much, if not more than men for the same job.  Anybody that says otherwise should prove it.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Already done.|`|e7wD8sUiaa	Women have had the power all along to get paid the same as men. The problem isn't discrimination, it is that women don't know how much their service is worth and are much less likely to negotiate their starting pay and their raises. They just accept what they're offered. Men on the other hand WILL negotiate their starting pay and raises. They will also ask for raises when they feel their work merits an increase even though they may not be up for a raise at the time. Women tend not to do that. Remember, when you go in for a job you are selling your services to the employer. Your pay is the price you charge. If your employer makes you an offer you can ask for more or accept it. If you accept it, it is your responsibility, not your employer's. KNOW YOUR WORTH, but also remember the market has an effect on what your service is worth.If there are several spots open and you are the only candidate, you can pretty much write your own ticket. If there is only one position and there are several applicants, you may have to accept a lower starting pay. However, at least you're in the door. When things get better you can ask for a raise. Knowledge is the best way to get what you deserve.  The federal government should have NO say whatsoever in this matter.|`|1e517d457abe5a99863a757df71245e3aa	To anyone on here that actually thinks women do get paid for equal work they are wrong.

Why not try and placate the masses if you can.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	"The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which states that the 180-day statute of limitations for pay discrimination resets with each new discriminatory paycheck, was signed into U.S. law on January 29, 2009, by President Barack Obama."    This means that those who believe they have been unfairly paid will have more time in which to file a discrimination suit. It does NOT mean that the government will dictate pay scales, or automatically eliminate pay disparities.|`|oMOiAFRBaa	This is hardly too good to be true.    The fact is, a woman may be making less than a man for reasons other than sexual discrimination.  Maybe a woman isn't as good at negotiating her salary than her male counterparts.  I don't know about you, but if I am hiring someone for a position and the women consistently low-ball their salary expectations, I am going to take the discount and pay them less.  I'd do the same to any man that comes into my office and doesn't have the confidence to demand a high salary for their work.    All this bill does is ignore legitimate reasons for pay discrepancies like the one I just described and consigns them all to the status of "sexism in the workplace." The only people who will be benefiting from this policy are the trial lawyers who sue on behalf of plaitiffs and make a boatload of cash that we all have to pay for when companies raise their prices to cover their exhorbant legal fees.    I hope this has proven educational to you.  I personally think that women should get paid as much as men do, but only if they are aggressive enough to demand it.  I work in a profession where they are.|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	It is already illegal to pay some one less for the same job, long before Obama came along.

CM1dfztQaa	You're absolutely right. The fastest way for the economy to be stimulated is to give tax breaks to the economic class that spends money. I think I heard this discussion on O'reilly. Anyway, someone on the show made the above suggestion and I agree.     Cut out taxes, all together between now and August, for those who make $75,000.00/year or less. That gives all of these people extra money on their paychecks now and they are most likely to use the money straight away. Thus, stimulating the economy.    Those who are in higher pay brackets tend to put their money in the banks to gain interest, so giving them tax breaks does nothing but make the economy worse.|`|PSc1BEZTaa	Pelosi and her pet projects!....

Michael Phelps got probation as well for the intial offense but, unlike Paris, successfully complied with the terms, including losing his license for a time.  They both got the same treatment at the time of the initial charge (as would have non-celebrities).     I don't think people think Paris was let off easy when she actually went to jail.  People thought she was let off easy when, at first, she was let out of jail after only a few days of a 90-day sentence.

The military leaders in this country have repeatedly said they don't want the troubles draftees bring along with them as baggage. The only thing you get with a draft is the poor and the un-connected.

Here is what I know about the subject, which is an important subject that needs to be discussed without posturing.      Charlie Rangel (D-NY) has been attempting to get the draft reinstated since at least 2006.  He has not had much luck getting any support from fellow democrats in his effort, which is evident from the link that you cited.    Here is a link to a transcript from CNN dated 11/20/06, which is a good conversation starter; as a parent of three sons I reacted to the comments of Former Defense Secretary William Cohen (R) with discomfort... I don't want my kids to be drafted into a war, particularly a misbegotten one like Iraq, but is this selfishness at the expense of others?      WILLIAM COHEN, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY: I think it's good for the country to have parents have heartburn. And I think every parent, every citizen of this country should always ask the question, what are we committing someone else's son or daughter to or husband or wife to?       Me again, it is a moral dilemma.  One thing, if the draft exists, I tend to believe that we would be less likely to go to war because EVERY parent (it is the parental generation that orders up wars, not the generation that is actually soldiering) would have a personal interest in the causes for which we are going to war.  Of course, privileged people would have their ways of avoiding the draft even without going to Canada, we learned that in the 60's - Bush, Cheney, and many other draft-age guys managed to avoide the war if not military service.    At this point I neither support nor irretrievably object reinstating the draft because I am not confronted with having to make that decision.    If the draft were to be reinstated, then I do believe that women should be drafted, too.      Here is the exchange between candidates McCain and Obama on the subject at the National Service Forum at Columbia University back in Sept of '08    MCCAIN: Well, I would remind you in the days of the draft that it was then most unfair because the lowest income Americans served and the wealthiest found ways of avoiding draft. I think the all- volunteer force is having difficulties recruiting and retaining because were too small and we need to expand the size of our military and we need to do it as rapidly as possible.    OBAMA But its also important that a president speaks to military service as an obligation not just of some, but of many. You know, I traveled, obviously, a lot over the last 19 months. And if you go to small towns, throughout the Midwest or the Southwest or the South, every town has tons of young people who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thats not always the case in other parts of the country, in more urban centers. And I think its important for the president to say, this is an important obligation. If we are going into war, then all of us go, not just some.    ***WOODRUFF: You were saying a moment ago that you think there should be more young people serving in the military; we need a broader demographic cross-section. How do you do that short of a draft?  OBAMA: Again, I think that inspiring young people to serve is something that the president is uniquely positioned to do.  Now, it doesnt always have to be service in uniform. One of the things, that if you talk to our generals, they are desperate for, is a civilian counterpart to our military forces.  Our military is the best in the world, but they are asked to do so many different things because our civilian operations, our State Department, USAID have been underfunded, have atrophied.  And for us to say, serve in the military, but if thats not where you want to serve, learn a foreign language and go into the foreign service. And by the way, we will deploy you in some difficult areas, but thats part of what it means to be an American and to serve and to sacrifice.    We need agricultural specialists in places like Afghanistan. We need civil engineers that can do some of the work that currently our military officers are doing.    So, look, do I expect that my national service plan gets passed exactly as I proposed? Of course not. Thats not the way legislation works. But I believe were in one of those special moments, one of those defining moments, where the American people recognize that we are not on the right track. That our government is not working the way it should. That our economy is not working the way it should. And they expect leadership from Washington, but they understand that they have to be a part of the solution as well.    And I think thats why we have to seize this moment. And the next president is going to have to actively pursue these issues of service  And so, I think a president who is consistently asking for young people to reach for something higher, something bigger than themselves, I think, will get enormous response.      I omitted the part with specific suggestions by Obama for increasing the military that did not remotely relate to the draft.|`|1TJ5v6Xzaa	If there is a draft, we would be one step closer to being a communist country.  Leave it to the liberals to take us into that direction.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Source for when Obama promised a draft? I'll wait...|`|JthubNIsaa	Rangle has nothing to do with drafting people.

d997b5ac6eed086c92a56500bdb74431aa	Ever see what they wear at Walmart and McDonald's?  If that's not branding your herd, I don't know what is.|`|m5J36D28aa	Those jobs are for the unambitious people who refuse to educate themselves.  They are doomed to live with family or several roommates until they get their act together.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	They don't pay a living wage unless you are 16 years old and living with mom and dad.  Get real.|`|r10dlDsGaa	Hmmm, weird.  I was under the impression that slaves didn't get paid at all.  But seriously, why should jobs like that have to pay wages that will feed a family of four?  Why should a high school student working at McDonalds make enough to feed a family of four?  They shouldn't.  If a person is responsible, and has a family of four, then he or she probably has a job that is higher paid.  Walmart and McDonalds aren't supposed to be places one can earn a living, unless one is a manager or another higher up.  That is why minimum wage increases are so ridiculous.|`|B1XT60WEaa	Do they go out and kidnap people to work there?  Maybe McDonald's Should pay like an auto worker $70.00 an hour and charge you  $23 for a hamburger?  I,ve been to those places too. Prefer McDonald,s|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Most of McDonalds employees are part-time.  Many of them work at McDonalds to get spending money, not to support their families.    I dont know what a Big Mac costs. But lets say its $3.50.  If McDonalds doubles its employees wages, the price of a Big Mac will go up to at least $4.50, and maybe more.  Many poor people eat at McDonalds because they can get a filling, if not a healthy, meal for relatively little money.  Raise the price of a Big Mac by 28 percent and they wont be able to afford it.    Nobody is forced to work at McDonalds.  If someone is not happy with what they are paid, they should move to Wall Street where the pay and benefits are better.    Wal-Mart is a manipulative company.  They buy a large percentage of their merchandise from China and adjust their workers hours so they can be categorized as part-time employees.    But here, again, nobody is forced to work at Wal-Mart.      "A slaves family was at least fed."|`|v4qLlGGhaa	Wal-mart and McDonalds do not pay a living wage. Period. Unless you have worked in one, you should be happy for what you have.

M3maZgdyaa	It is kind a funny that Clinton was impeached but we let him finish his term. Or did they impeach him afterwords, that is impossible.|`|AA12191521	generally impeachment has more to do with politics than the law. I don't think it carries as much weight as a conviction. Andrew Johnson was impeached and he is largely seen as a bad president for trying to end reconstruction. But in the south, where reconstruction was a cruel and onerous policy that prolonged bitterness and division and kept the wounds of the civil war fresh for far too long, he's generally not hated at all. How severely an impeachment is viewed depends on what side you were on.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	The real question is how can you be friends with a republican? We all know Bubba was the greatest and nothing he did can tarnish that image.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	History will judge Clinton as a far better president than Bush.|`|b653f9e79cd3f6e985dc3afbe09c9b14aa	sowhatsamattawityourface|`|i8EYcOoMaa	History also reports the real reasons why a Congress impeaches a president, and if such reasons were petty, it's not the impeached president who looks bad.|`|LLnNjH94aa	Generically yes.    There are not a lot of bright people that think Clinton was a "great" President though.|`|rrSaoOK2aa	LOL    They are right.|`|oBL3AtRfaa	Clinton demeaned the office of the President.|`|2jSW9Asfaa	Bush might not have been impeached but hopefully he'll be prosecuted for his torturing|`|7cc078f55da409c4d9b845dbc7c568daaa	I thikn they mean that History teds to reveal a more clear picture of the office holder, simply because more facts and trths are discovered the longer you wait..|`|ec6b4fb07cc60e9ae7bef47000091ab4aa	"An unexamined life is not worth living."
bQKNjFqyaa	Sign a contract for the MOS (job) that is offering the bonus, not every MOS gets one, and each branch is different. You can also receive them for reenlisting, although the longer you've been in the less, if any you get :)    The more they need people to fill that job the higher the bonus.|`|tHKRgH8Baa	Depends on what branch and what job you get. In the Air Force, certain jobs have an initial enlistment bonus. Most bonuses are re-enlistment bonuses. The idea is to entice people with jobs that are hard for the military to fill to stay as oppose to joining the civilian sector. My job currently has "multiplier" of 2. What that means is that they will multiply my monthly base pay by 2, then multiply that by the amount of years that I would reenlist for and that number would be my bonus. (There's multipliers up to 7 I believe, max of $90,000) They usually pay half upon re-enlistment and the other have is spread out over the term of service. Uncle Sam gets his cut of course unless you are deployed at the time that you sign.|`|4GCH1lTyaa	the only way i got one was to re-enlist...once in awhile you can get them by going to certain schools or moving up grade levels|`|59aJrRVuaa	It depends on what branch. The Army offers a fair amunt of them from what  I know I was in the Marines and only a very very few mos gave any sort of a bonus. It depends on the job and how good you score on your asvab. Dont sign up for the military just for the bonus because that is the wrong reason and you will hate life.|`|qbMCd2myaa	Well my husband just told me no one in his platoon that "had no other option" but the army, and told their recruiters that, did NOT get a bonus. They all also got the same level on their psych exams class C or something-means they're kind of nuts lol- which means they definitely wouldn't get a bonus. strange coincidence.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	You get a bonus by either A: enlisting into a job that is considered a critical field or B: re-enlisting into a job that is considered a critical field. Example of jobs that may be considered critical could be infantry, military police, truck drivers, special operations and intelligence to name a few. Check with a local recruiter in the service of your choice for more information.
6Fsliwlhaa	You can change it if you qualify for the MOS you want to change it to.  The easiest way to change it is to reenlist for another MOS when you are within two years of your ETS.  You can talk to a recruiter for more information.  If you already know what you want to do then you should try to get that job now because when it is time to reenlist that MOS might be full and you can't get it.
J6ZZqnVVaa	no, it is because she is unqualified for the position.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	I doubt it.  It would be a very stupid move on there part.

vcWALQKcaa	I've been looking into it as well. So far I have not been convinced that signing up for "Government Funded Grants" (the company) is really worth while. I went as far as submitting my telle number and e-mail a few days ago.     Why I don't like them:    Since then, a rep from one of the dozen call centers, calls me 4 times a day. Thousands click the links I did a day, and they are getting the same treatment. The are trying aful hard to charge a lot of money. They aren't a non-profit organization after all. They aren't doing it for the good of the public.    It is not free like they lead you to believe. It costs about $50 per month.     They don't provide a physical address for their company.     Sounds like a scam to me. Its just a google for grants. I'm not about to waste $50 to find information that I can access from the REAL Google or the government website that is providing grants.

EDIT:  Relax, I'm being sarcastic.|`|uxu8qJUYaa	No, most liberals do not, there are a few exceptions.  Islamic extremists believe in House of War and House of Peace.  House of Peace is Islamic land, House of War is non-Islamic land.    Extremist view is that there is no peace in the House of Peace until the House of War is wiped out and turned into Islamic land.     Wars such as Iran/Iraq, are not because of House of Peace but because of the existence of House of War.      If land that was once House of Peace becomes House of War, it is an affront to Islam.  ie, Israel, Kashmir, Chechnya, etc.    The extremists believe this, not the average Muslim.|`|AA10123414	Yes.|`|OYtoM9fXaa	Sure he understands it.

He does not understand their goal (the destruction of the US and imposing Islamic rule for the world) and their dedication in killing anyone and dying to achieve that goal. He also doesn't realize that they are fully prepared to fight for 100 or more years.    Unlike here in America, they are raising their children to fight, kill and die for Islam.    http://www.israelsmessiah.com/terrorism/...|`|AA11163314	Nope.    If he did - he would not have ordered that we close the prison at Gitmo.|`|mdHqr17kaa	yes but he is trying to get the Marxist / KGB agitators who infiltrated Islam to utilize the religion as a means to an end to "change" their message in recognition of a fellow traveler obtaining leadership of "the West"; is the Time Magazine cover not "proof" of this?    Rejoice, comrades!  Intellectual leaders who took up Islam as a means to an end, no more religious jihad needed!

However, I happen to think on two points herein, it is fair to say (despite an executive order to close Quantanamo) that he does.    One, is his committment to "special" trials (military tribunals if you will) for suspected terrorists. Granted he chastised Bush for having done so but he is committed to the same practice.    Secondly, he supports rendition just as Bush did (though once again he chastised Bush for the practice). Rendition is when they send the suspect to their home country. Dare I say, the suspects aren't treated with even a shred of the level of decency they would get at Quantanamo or elsewhere.|`|lHDff8Braa	Yes, and that is why he is changing from the failed policies of Bush, under which our country became LESS safe, and the terrorists were able to increase their power.  At least under Obama, we will actually be going after the terrorists who attacked our country; not invading some other place that had nothing whatsoever to do with 9-11, and was not in any way an imminent threat to the US.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	He claimed he did in his campaign and we know no one lies in their campaigns. But then he cut defense budgets so maybe he doesn`t.|`|GG7WjH6Raa	I hope, he would not understand as Bush.|`|IUw5Z395aa	I mean, they do run by the mantra of, "Let's blow s!@  up"; it's not all that hard to understand.

2zhQznahaa	No not usually.  You can do a Montgomery GI Bill kicker, but I dont still think that it will give you 4 years.   You can become a pimp after you get out of the army, go to university, rent a huge flat, and charge surcharged rates for all your other rooms, (like subletting), and make some money on that.  ALso when you get to college out of the military, you can just go to the military filing line, and just talk with one of the specialized clerks there, and they will get you to fill out all the right forms, and all that.   If you move to a place that has a low enough cost of living, if you do that flat rental thing, and do the MGIBill, (even before they came out with this additional Basic "BAH" clause, where they will pay you a BAH now), you could probably subsist in a low cost community.  But not New Y. or whatever.  So yeah.   It will probably shove you out like hmm, 36 months worth of active enrollment in college.  You can invest more to get more out, known as the Kicker, which alot of Veterans Affairs people come by and give you seminars about in   "Junior Enlisted Development Concilling."  And pretty much, you can study whatever.  It just has to all go towards one common goal of a degree plan.  And it can't be too many electives that don't converge into that plan.  So you hash out a plan with them when you enroll.      *What Siggy said is real practical * True.|`|AA11313983	The US Army will fully pay for a PhD if you do it right.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	If you get a scholarship.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	you go and they pay sorta i mean you need to talk to the recuirter.|`|AFNgR9jTaa	The GI Bill will only pay for 3 years full time, you can however go to college and have the Army pay your student loans off with the loan repayment program. Also while serving you will receive TA to pay for schooling while serving (but mission comes first).    Also check out www.va.gov for further information|`|6Fsliwlhaa	Yes, you can use up to $4,500 a year ($250 per semester hour) for tuition assistance the whole time you are in.  You can even use it while deployed taking distance learning (online) classes.  The only catches is that TA doesn't pay for books (but some colleges include books with the tuition meaning you won't pay a dime) and if you fail or drop a class you have to pay the army the course of the class unless you dropped the class because of duties.    Mind you that this doesn't even include the GI Bill and the Army college fund which can give you over $80,000 combined for a six year enlistment if you qualify.  Also, you can get up to $65,000 to repay college loans instead of the GI Bill.|`|FDEuHT7jaa	what's the use when you won't even be alive to enjoy it.

To get the ACF i took a enlistment bonus incentive that was only 2,000 dollars less.    In all I am receiving $71,000 for school, and the best part is i don't have to pay for any college or touch any of that money while i'm active duty.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	Yes the Army will fully pay for your degree.

You don't have to pay into the GI Bill anymore either. It will change in August of 2009. Check the VA website for more information on the GI Bill.

Mexico is rich.. corrupt.. and it is the job of the Catholic Church and our Government to try and make Mexico see the light of treating their people far, far better.  E Verify helps us do that.  The Fence helps us do that.  We need that system and a lot of people are sick and tired of all the baloney we are getting on the issue.  This is our country... do it now.

The Income Tax is the root of all evil, as the great Frank Chodorov once said.  It permits the government to rob the American people of their money and waste it on unconstitutional boondoggles.  If you want to enforce the rest of the Constitution, it is impossible if the Income Tax permits the government to fund unconstitutional activities.  Without the Income Tax, the government would have to cut back to the level of big government we had 10 years ago, which is actually far too big itself.    I'd also repeal the 17th Amendment.  The Founders designed the Senate as a body that represented the interests of the state governments and was designed to protect the states against the federal government's tendency to illegally seize state powers for itself.  With direct election of Senators, it has been turned into a body of the most corrupt politicians in America.    I'd also be tempted to repeal the 19th Amendment.  While I feel that women deserve all the same rights as men, I do not regard the act of voting as a right.  If voting is a right, then that means that a person has the right to vote for whomever they want.  For example, a person would have the "right" to vote for a candidate who advocates imprisoning people who do not harm others (people routinely do this) or even for a candidate who advocates the genocide of a minority group (as the people of Germany did in 1933).  Obviously, such a "right" is incompatible with the existence of any other rights, as it can lead to the violation of those rights, and there can be no such thing as a "conflict" of genuine rights (if there appears to be a conflict, at least 1 of the "rights" in question is imaginary), so the decision of who is to be allowed to vote is a purely pragmatic decision.  As scientific evidence has shown, men and women tend to have different thought processes.  Men tend to be more rationally inclined, while women tend to be more emotionally inclined.  This means that women are more likely to vote for a demagogue, while men are more likely to vote for the candidate who proposes the more logical policies.  Men are inclined to be more willing to take risks, while women are inclined against risks.  This means that men are more likely to allow people to do things that are "dangerous" but do not harm others, while women are more willing to support tyranny under the false pretense that it will bring about "security" and, due to their inclination toward emotions, are probably not going to rationally analyze these policies.  History proves this to be the case, as the original goal of the Women's Suffrage movement was to ban alcohol and considering that Women's Suffrage has led to massive growth in the size and scope of government, with the big government party being majority female and the (supposedly) limited government party being majority male.  However, I think a better solution would be to prosecute and convict every elected official who violates his/her oath to uphold and defend the Constitution against its foreign and domestic enemies for treason (as is currently possible under our nation's laws).  In effect, this would make it illegal for anti-Constitution politicians to actually implement their illegal policies in office and would eliminate any need to restrict voting "rights" in order to protect constitutional government from its enemies.    An alternative solution would be to abolish the 24th Amendment and to implement a Poll Tax as the only form of taxation.  If the voters had to pay a tax to vote and could not pay taxes in exchange for giving up their "right" to vote, this would make it impossible for special interest groups to use government to transfer wealth to them.    Furthermore, the 23rd Amendment should be repealed.  The District of Criminals is a district of tax consumers, not taxpayers, so it can hardly be argued that they are taxed without representation.  In fact, they are currently represented without taxation because they are allowed to vote for president even though they are mostly employees of the federal government.    I do feel that the 2nd Amendment needs to be clarified.  I suggest that the preamble to the 2nd Amendment (you know, the part that says "a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state") be removed and the 2nd Amendment be amended to simply read "the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."  The preamble has unfortunately been "interpreted" by politicians to mean that the core text of the Amendment doesn't mean what it says.  By abolishing the preamble, activist judges will be prevented from aiding criminals by outlawing self-defense or permitting "reasonable" restrictions on an inalienable right.    I also propose a new amendment, which would explicitly outlaw entities such as the Bank of the United States (there were 2 of them in the early years of America) and the Federal Reserve and to expressly prohibit the federal government or any state o|`|lJPT0PGGaa	14.|`|K4VZtIr3aa	The one that gives Republicans the right to vote.

H7SQEM4Daa	Why would you think they are entitled to benefits when they haven't worked here and contributed by paying taxes?

If not, then no, they will not receive any pension or SS.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	No.  Of course not.  That's why you are going to have to file an affidavit of support.

The good news is that each of them only has to work 10 years in order to be eligible for Social Security benefits.|`|9PAavWnyaa	Sweetharttt has the correct answer except for:  After five years your sponsorship ends and if they are disabled they can qualify for SSI benefits. They can also qualify for SSI after the age of 65. They will be able to receive SSI for only seven years unless they become U.S.  citizens.|`|AA11966821	No, they are not eligible for any sort of pension except what they earned in their own country and bring into the US.      To collect Social Security, they must work and contribute to Social Security for a minimum of 10 years (40 quarters).  However, at their current ages, by the time they actually get here, it is highly unlikely that will be able to find jobs and keep them long enough to accumulate proper credits.  Also, it is impossible to live on Social Security alone.  Not enough money.    They are expressly barred from receiving any sort of assistance, welfare, Social Security, medicare, medicaid, or charity aid under the "public charge" law.  If they cannot support themselves in their old age, either you have to support them or they will be denied immigration as potential public charges.    To petition for them, you must prove you have sufficient income and assets to support them and guarantee a $30,000 bond -- each.  The bond is in effect for 10 years from the date of their arrival, or until they become citizens.  If they attempt to collect any public benefit while they are here, they can be denied citizenship under the "public charge" law, plus you have to repay anything they receive.    If you cannot or will not support your parents, and if they do not have sufficient income, assets and pension to support themselves for the rest of their lives, do not petition for their immigration.  They will be rather elderly by the time they arrive, and international relocation can be particularly stressful and have negative impacts on the health of older people.  They may remain healthier and happier in their own home with their lifelong friends, familiar surroundings, etc, than uprooting them.  It is a very difficult adjustment.  And a very expensive one.  How are you going to pay for their health insurance, medical care, housing, and everything else they will require?  Nobody is going to pay for it but you and your parents.
AA12098193	There is no such thing as "many different definitions of torture". There are legal definitions and a number of "tailored to suit your needs" definitions.  Torture is banned as a violation of human rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) where it is stated that "No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."  Torture is a violation of human rights under a number of international conventions, specially under the "United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1987).  Torture was somewhat prohibited in the USA under Title 18 of the U.S.C.  2340. I say somewhat because its definition limits torture to acts that cause permanent bodily damage done within the "maritime and territorial jurisdiction" of the USA.    In October 2006 torture became legal in the USA by means of the "Military Commissions Act", a trick used by the Bush administration in order to torture human beings and get away with it.  Nothing new, since before Napalm was defined as a conventional (non-chemical) weapon in order to use it on Vietnamese people and avoid international law.|`|AA11313983	Yes, but there are many different definitions of torture.

IMHO, This country would never have made it to 200 if we had not watched our civil rights and civil liberties(Freedoms) as strongly and after each administration that took away any of those rights and liberties, we fought back in the courts and Congress to regain our lost rights and liberties, until now.     In the last 7 years we have lost many of our rights and liberties.  How, you ask have we lost any of our rights and freedoms.  In the name of SECURITY we have allowed the past administration to take away our freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. In the name of PATRIOTISM we have allowed the past administration to imprison citizens for indefinite time.  In the name of fighting terrorism we have surrendered our rights to freedom of Speech.       In the last 7 years the government has doubled in size and with the growth of government has been as huge loss of rights and liberties.|`|c07v7O80aa	First, only those with no knowledge of the history of the U.S. outside their own short lifetimes imagine rights being eroded. The farther back you, go the fewer liberties were afforded equally.     The whole theory of the Constitutional contract is that government has those powers granted TO it, all else being reserved to the people. In other words, freedom is limited to the extend seen to be needed to govern and provide some measure of equal liberties. You can watch any newscast and see multiple stories relating to liberties and rights that were NOT  protected even 50 years ago.

HA2IV3r3aa	Yes, quality of life is better in the AF for both servicemen and families.  There are two main reasons I can think of:  1) The AF has this strategy of spending all of the money they have on living amenities and then asking the government for money to spend on actual operational needs.  This has, of course, gotten them into trouble now that the government doesn't have a ton of capital to spend on useless technologies.  2) The Army likes to think that people who live in terrible conditions are tough, when in reality they are just poor and underprivelaged.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Best barracks i have ever seen are on Fort Campbell Ky    Army post have way more recreational and MWR facilities than Air Force bases do.

AFB's tend to be near smaller towns out in the boonies.    The biggest differrence id work life,    They AF runs more like a corporation.    You pretty much have set duty hours.    and you deploy less and for shorter periods than the army does.

083d6fafca78da36d20de847faf89803aa	Thank you for your interest in serving.  The Primary difference between the Army Reserve, and the National Guard, is that the Army Reserve acts as a backup force for the Active Duty Army.  The National Guard however, is a complete force that answers to the governor of that state in times of peace. (Except when mobalized by the President.)    would either pay for my entire college?     Both the Reserves and National Guard offer benefits while attending college.  Details will vary slightly depending upon your location, and job.    do both the army reserves and national guard pay the same for drills?    They do receive the same amount of pay while drilling (depending upon your rank).  While on active duty they receive the same pay and benefits of active duty personal.     would also like to know if when you go to basic training, do you have to live in that state or do they fly you there once a weekend for the 3 months?    You are asking two seprate questions here.  While attending BCT + AIT (Basic) you are on active duty training next to active duty personal.  Your unit doesn't have to be in the state you currently reside in, however comuting several hundred miles every month is a bit of a drag.       You may wish to consider the benefits that ROTC offer.  Good luck.

DTSUJe2oaa	Medicare does not take personal property if you stay in a nursing but state Medicaid does and a trust can be pursued by the state.~|`|USoqyjaAaa	Medicare does not pay for custodial nursing home care.  Medicaid does, if one has a low income and very few assets.  Medicaid is for the disabled and poor, who are often on waiting lists for years before receiving services, in the case of the disabled.      Anyone who has assets and transfers them in order to qualify for this assistance, or assists others in doing so, is taking away from the people for whom it was intended and should be ashamed of themselves.    I'd be willing to bet that the people who do this are the same ones who rally against "socialized medicine"- but they're all for it when they want their bills paid by the government.

In stages over the next dozen years, Iraq attained its independence as a kingdom in 1932. A "republic" was proclaimed in 1958, but in actuality a series of strongmen ruled the country until 2003. The last was SADDAM Husayn. Territorial disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990, Iraq seized Kuwait but was expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during the Gulf War of January-February 1991. Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance with UNSC resolutions over a period of 12 years led to the US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 and the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime. US forces remain in Iraq under a UNSC mandate until 2009 and under a bilateral security agreement thereafter, helping to provide security and to support the freely elected government. The Coalition Provisional Authority, which temporarily administered Iraq after the invasion, transferred full governmental authority in June of 2004 to the Iraqi Interim Government, which governed under the Transitional Administrative Law for Iraq (TAL). Under the TAL, elections for a 275-member Transitional National Assembly (TNA) were held in Iraq in January 2005. Following these elections, the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) assumed office. The TNA was charged with drafting Iraq's permanent constitution, which was approved in a October 2005 constitutional referendum. An election under the constitution for a 275-member Council of Representatives (CoR) was held in December 2005. The CoR approval in the selection of most of the cabinet ministers in May of 2006 marked the transition from the ITG to Iraq's first constitutional government in nearly a half-century.|`|8YBiVlcTaa	'some stuff' well it hot and sandy.|`|7cf5d017651468feaf5b9e9c75ac7247aa	Wikipedia is your friend    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	It's home to the Babilonian Empire from Biblical times also the hanging gardens of Babilon, and supposedly the where the garden of Eden was is now Al Qurna just north of Basra, where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers meet.

VKrePQZqaa	No, not necessarily. Even though it may be the will of the people through the legislature or executive. Its incredibly important when it comes to the separation of power. The Judicial Branch ensures the laws either branch puts into place, is legit and most importantly Constitutional. They protect our rights and interpret the legitimacy of the law, even though we might want it in place
QIQNzE11aa	It has to do with trying to make sure they do not come up for parole within their life times if it can be helped. Many prisoners have fought and won the right to parole when being sentenced to life without parole. So the judge makes this even harder. They do not give a sentence without parole, but try to figure out how much longer this guy is likely to live and give them a sentence in years that nearly ensures that they will never get out. It's to protect the lives and families of everyone.     Sentencing them to death row is very costly. The average criminal will fight and use tax dollars to fight the death sentence. The average time is 10.5 years. The average cost of an inmate who will serve in a maximum security prison is 90,000 dollars less per year, per inmate, than an inmate living on death row. Meaning that one criminal who was sentenced to death will cost the tax payers millions and millions more. It's cripling our country financially to put anyone on death row. Here's a great article from Calfornia on how much it costs that backs up the figures i have put down. http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-de...    It's also harder to get a convinction over turned when it comes to getting a sentence of 105 years compared to death penalty. Too many people out there fighting any death row sentence. They do not like the thought of killig people in the name of justice.     governors have been known to release death row inmates when they don't believe in it when they are leaving office. You do not hear of that happening with people who are sentenced to 105 years.|`|4eTyCuRSaa	I would assume that these are multiple sentences that are added together.  As an example if someone is convicted of 4 murders and each one carries a 20 year sentance then the total would be 80 years.      These sentences can also be determined to be served consecutively or concurrently.|`|c9c21b842bc0967b25ee1f5620157edfaa	Because of parole eligibility.  You can get out on parole in a 1/3 of the sentence, in the case of a "life", that is 7 years, in the case of 105 years that is 35 years. And if you don't think it's possible, read (or rent the movie), "The Onion Field", those guys were sentenced to death and were out in about 15 years.|`|Yh63ysrzaa	Because of the possibility of parole.|`|HeoS75kGaa	Every state is different.  Each one makes their own laws about prison sentences.  Some states have what's called Indeterminate Sentencing, which means that a minimum must be served, and a maximum allowable..  You've heard them on TV, such as 8? to Life, meaning at least ? of the maximum sentence must be served.    Many reasons.  First, no two crimes are exactly identical.  If someone commits murder, maybe they just don't care, never did care, won't ever care, and is just too damned likely to do it again tomorrow.  So you want him put away forever, for life.  But there's that 8? - Life.  That's the law.    Why?  Because someone else committed murder, but he only meant to shoot the victim to make a point, not kill him.  It doesn't change the fact that the victim is still dead, though, so he has to go to prison.  But nothing is served by locking him away forever with the cold-blooded murderer.    So, here's the point, and the second part of the answer.  The cold-blooded murderer is going to come up for parole in 8? years.  He's not getting parole, you can count on it.  But here's some dumb idiot that screwed up his life, and has a chance to make good.  He MIGHT get parole.  And, since prisons are overcrowded, some convicts are going to get out anyway.    In a society as complex as America, with a population of ? Billion people, there is no One-Size-Fits-All legal judgment.  So the individual circumstances of each crime is considered, and then considered again when parole comes up to alleviate the overcrowding.    That's for those convicted to life sentences.  There are others where the maximum penalty is 25 years, say like Armed Robbery, but got charged with 5 separate incidents of that crimes.  So he gets sentenced to 125 years.  There is no life sentence, even if he does end up serving the rest of his life in prison.|`|AA11622716	The sentences available for crimes are determined by the legislature.  The court cannot impose any old sentence it wishes.  So, if a burglary has a potential sentence of 10 years, and the defendant is convicted of 15 burglaries, the court can impose 15 sentences of 10 years each, but cannot impose a sentence of life in prison.  Then, if some of them are reversed, the defendant still must serve the remaining sentences.|`|0zdt6udlaa	Because nobody knows how long someone will live and they have to define the sentence in years.

The M-16A2 is good for a point target at 550 meters and area targets at 800 meter.    The US doesn't use AKs because they're Soviet-manufactured.  They also use a 7.62 round, which is heavier, so you can carry less, and it's a killing wound.  The 5.56 of the M-16 is a wounding round.  Ideally, you injure a guy and another guy stops to help him, taking out two combatants.    You can also hit targets further away, carry more ammo, and the piping that reroutes the gasses from the explosion is easy to damage.  Bend it and an AK is useless.  They're great weapons for durability, but not as good for actual combat.|`|R7sGn7LMaa	The REAL reasons the US doesn't use the AK-47 are as follows:    -Jam easy. In the desert, conditions are terrible, guns will jam when most needed.    -Accuracy. Though powerful, the AK is less likely to hit an enemy from 100 yards out than the M16 A-4 that is currently in service. (To Marines).    -Confusion. This is perhaps the BIGGEST reason they arent used. Most of our enemies use the AK. The AK has a very distinct sound. I doesn't sound like anything we use. So, when you hear a burst from an AK, you automatically start looking to where the sound came from.   During the Vietnam war, this was the biggest reason for Friendly Fire. Soldiers would swap out the original M16 and use an AK that they would pick up off a dead enemy. As soon as they would shoot, soldiers, too far away to see that it is one of their own, would shoot in the area the AK was being fired.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	Because they're pieces of junk?

It sounds like the finance company never paid the dealer (that would be self-funding) and therefore has no claim to the title of the car.  The dealer would be the loan-holder.    That said, since the finance company did not bill you (and in fact indicated you had no loan in the prior moths), if you can document that, they have no claim to expect payment and therefore no repossession rights, yet..  While it is your responsibility to ascertain and make payments even without a bill, they abrogated that when they basically said there was no loan.    First you need to find out who holds the actual loan.  Once you do that, you should (assuming you can document this) be able to work out a new payment plan.    Side note - in general, when you are having difficulty with a bill you know you will eventually have to pay, its a good idea to put the estimated amount away in a stash until the matter is resolved, just in case.

QIQNzE11aa	The way they put it wasn't nice. But in the end, they did answer the question for you.    No, the landlord wouldn't assist your sister in any way in finding a place to live. Had the place burned due to faulty wiring or something that was managements fault, then they should be responsible to a degree to find new living arrangements.     The landlord cannot just ask for such a high sum either. An attorney should be brought in when it comes to the possiblity of of any negligence on her part or in case the management tries to sue.     sorry people feel the need to be rude to you on here. some have little tolerance for anyone but themselves.

7QtY1cSmaa	Hi.  My son was in the Air Cadets and he loved it. (It wasn't in Doncaster but I think they are all similar).    Everything is free.    You get a uniform and learn how to look after it. You learn to drill and march and, if you're good enough, represent the cadets at the remembrance day parade.    If you stick at it, you will learn to shoot, fly, navigate, use a radio and survive adverse conditions. There isn't a lot of flying but there is some. All books and equipment are provided but you can supplement this with better stuff from army surplus shops if you like. I would suggest swapping the provided combat trousers for Goretex ones if you do the combat course.    My son did his Duke of Edinburgh awards with them, flew in a Chinook, stayed on an RAF base for a week's camp and went on night manoeuvres where he had to navigate to a rendezvous at the same time as evading capture by "enemy" patrols provided by the RAF regiment. How cool is that?|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	army cadets is better air cadets are abit pathetic.. not all its cracked up to be apparently|`|zYZIw0Mqaa	I thought it was quite good, but I had to live because I moved :(     You do learn a hell of a lot, and apart from the occasional parachuting trip it is basically army cadets - without the stupid uniform.|`|NlAi17XXaa	15 every 3 months.    Flying (you can even get a flying license for free with the cadets if you put the time in or get a GCSE in basic aviation or something like that), gliding, shooting, drill, first aid training, sports competitions, swimming, camps (overseas and in the UK), Nijmegen march (100 mile, 4 day march in Nijmegen, Holland.), radio training, fieldcraft (learning how to conceal yourself, set up patrols etc.) you can also take part in the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme which you can put on your CV and looks good, Google it if you want to find out more.     Employers like to see "Served in the Air Training Corps" on a job application, military or civilian.    I would say go for it, I was in the cadets for a year, I quit because we we started doing a lot of unexciting things and a lot of my friends left and the people in charge were gay and I just wasn't having fun any more so I left. In that time though I had done plenty of shooting, as we had our own indoor range, I went flying twice, and was a first class cadet meaning I know stuff about the history of the RAF, some basic aircraft recognition, I can read maps, and I can perform some basic first aid.    I now intend to join the army in two years time.    I would ignore the army cadet trying to slate the air cadets, they always slag each other off lol. However, I would like to point out that the army cadets do no flying or gliding, however I will admit they do more fieldcraft. Remember the bigger group in your area will get the most funding and do more stuff.    Also, I'd like to point out one of the key reasons I left, because we weren't doing a lot and what we were doing was boring would probably not be the case in the city as the squadrons are a lot bigger and do more then in the countryside.
DTSUJe2oaa	Society Benefits from Legalized Gambling.  Legalized gambling is an industry regulated by agencies of state, and federal government. These governmental agencies establish regulations that focus on the policy functions of gambling entities.  The agencies ensure the integrity of the games offered to the public, and assume the responsibility to protect the public against unfair or dishonest gamming practices by those gambling entities.  The gambling industry is growing every year; the National Gambling Impact Study Commission states, in the year 1998, people in the United States lost fifty billion dollars in legal wagering."  Furthermore, the commission estimates that the figure will increase in coming years with no end insight.  The rapid growth of the gambling industry has imparted economic benefits and social costs.  Does the economic benefits justify the social costs of the ever growing industry of gambling?  The economic benefits are far greater than the social costs, and the gambling industry will enhance society as a whole, and with future planning (education of social costs incurred from gambling) eliminate or minimize the social costs.                      The significant social costs are pathological gambling, and crime.  The social costs that the gambling industry generates encompass pathological gambling, crime, and other maladies (e.g. prostitution, and drugs).  The American Psychiatric Association classifies pathological gambling as an impulse control disorder that ranges from unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling; to committing illegal acts such as forgery, fraud, theft or embezzlement to finance gambling.  Crime and other maladies (e.g. prostitution, and drugs) are social costs that would be associated with any social environment that generates high volume of public and private cash access.    It is noted by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission that crime and pathological gambling has the potential to become more widespread as the availability of legalized gambling increases.  The commission notes that, 125 million American adults gamble and the people who have negative consequences with gambling are estimated to be 7.5 million American adults.  That equates to 6% of the American adults who gamble.  The social costs are minimal compared to the economic benefit of jobs in low income and high unemployment area.                                      Jobs are an economical benefit that gambling industry generates in areas that have high unemployment.  This is especially true when casinos are being built.  The fields of employment range from construction (casino and hotel building), internal and external building and ground maintenance, card dealers, security, hotel, office, and management personnel.  An example is the testimony of Prairie Island Indian Community president Audrey Kohnen who stated, Treasure Island Resort & Casino is the number one employer in Goodhue County, located in the Seattle, Washington area.  He further stated, We have created more than 1,300 jobs at our hotel and casino.  His testimony was given at National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC) on January 7, 1999.  Furthermore, Mr. Audrey Kohnen read letters from different individuals; one such letter from a single mom who exclaimed that, the building of the casino had improved her familys economic status to a level that allowed her to qualify to purchase a home, and afford better health care for her family.  As the economic status improves for the people in the area of the gambling entities the investment and economic development benefits are generated.                      The investment and economic development benefits are generated by short supply and high demand for goods and services from the patrons who gamble, and the employees who work at these gambling entities.  The variety of goods and services demanded can be gasoline, grocery, prepared food (restaurants), entertainment, bank services, or cheaper overnight accommodations.  This short supply and high demand indicates a diverse financial market where profits can be made.  Profits that exist within the diverse financial market give cause for people to make the investments in different business entities.  It is the establishment of these business entities that generate the areas (surrounding community) economic development.  An example of the investment and economic development benefits of the gambling industry is the extensive growth in population and construction development being done in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada.  According to the National Gambling Impact Study Commission the city of Las Vegas, Nevada is the fastest growing city in the United States.  It is the abundance of investment and economic development that generates the enhancement of tax revenues for the local government, state government, and federal government.                        Enhanced tax revenues are another economi|`|84d89bae86a755a6030aaff81044bdecaa	Go to http://www.mygovern.com and become a candidate. You can make the decisions and history.

bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	A new Web site is tracking which U.S. House and Senate members have discovered the joy of tweetingand which haven't.     The L.A. Times tech blog has the scoop on Tweet Congress, the aptly named site that lets you search for Twitter-savvy House representatives and Senators by name or location.     You can also find out who's the most followed (John Culberson, R-TX, with an impressive 5,932 Twitter followers, and counting) and the most active (yep, ditto). Indeed, Republican tweeters outnumber Democrats almost two-to-one (41 to 24), while IndependentsI'm looking at you, Liebermanare still in the dark when it comes to the red-hot microblogging service. (Speaking of which ... click here for a quick Twitter primer.)    Pop quiz: Which state is leading the pack when it comes to best Twitter representation? If you guessed California, New York, or Washington state (home of Microsoft, right?), well, you guessed wrong. Instead, try South Carolina, with four of its eight U.S. representatives tweeting away. Up next: New Mexico (two of five) and Ohio (seven of 20). Among the many zilches: New York, the District of Columbia, Washingtonand yes, Alaska.    Also interesting, but a little harder to quantify: Finding out which representatives are actually tweeting themselves, and who's just staffing it out. Rep. Culberson of Texas looks like he's really getting into it ("you will always be talking to me not staff," he tweeted last week). Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill also seems to be getting into the spirit: "What a game. Found myself pulling for the underdog", she Twittered during the Super Bowl.

yW418gIJaa	This is a very good question and if assuming you are a liberal, you are beginning to take the red pill and open your eyes...    Why are liberals ultra aware?  Because he must be speaking alot of truth that they do not want the blind public to become aware of.  Those who listen to Rush have heard this as you said for last 15-16 years.      This is the same track path the Nazi Fascist party took if you do your history homework here.  You silence the other party, then you choke it to death after everyones attention has been diverted away.  To do this, the democratic powerhouse that is the House of Rep and the Senate currently, will smear conservative talk radio "tauting unfairness debate" (see The Fairness doctrine).  Once they gain majority public opinion backing them, with a pen stroke, Rush and conservative opposition is silenced.      Then they will be choked out behind closed doors once public attention is diverted to the next "fabricated crisis" that causes fear and acceptance of more freedom taking policies.      For example, I would bet that at least 90% (and im being generous) of the American folks who voted for Obama, went to polls and just pushed Blue...  They have no idea who is in senate or house of reps that they helped get there.  So with this new stimulus filled with pork, unless they have heard the voice of opposition, those American folk are lost in the sauce and have no clue as to what it contains.  They dont research this or look it up, they just drink the Koolaid and move on to the next media distraction conviniently presented to them through their TVs and internet.      Dont kid yourself, these politicians, especially Obama with his loyal group of media lapdogs (matt lauer) HONORING this man with coins and crap already and he has done absolutely NOTHING for America yet....

Heck, you can't really even speak in total freedom on this Yahoo forum...whenever a liberal gets offended at something you say (regardless of the f-words and ugliness they spit out) they'll "report" you and have your words removed.

Usually, when there is a clerical problem, you just keep plodding at it until it gets properly corrected.  Trying to prove malice, incompetence, or even simple clerical error is time-consuming and a waste of company resources.  If company error causes you financial inconvenience, there are a variety of civil remedies to protect workers in such situations, and payroll law in most states is pretty strict.

If possible, don't even blame the women - say that you realize (now) that they were extremely busy, but again that the delays were extremely frustrating.  It may be that your boss knows these women are incompetent and will be on your side. Just relax, stay calm and this will turn out alright.|`|kPWGVeWhaa	It gets tricky from company to company.

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	If you honestly want to know about military housing, the military section could answer you with details.    I believe that the housing allowance is part of the military pay that they receive.  I think my husband told me that he had to pay taxes on the amount of housing dollars he received.  It is considered income.  It is part of the pay that they agreed to when they accepted the job.  The amount is supposed to cover the rent and some utilities.    When my husband comes home from work, I'll ask him about it.  If he tells me differently, I'll update my answer.    You may be interested in reading this question from the military section of YA.  If you take away the military housing allowance, the pay is pitifully low.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    ***Edited to add:  I talked to my hubby and Yes, housing allowances are taxable income.  So is their food and clothing allowances.    So I'd say that the difference is that our military members work for the taxable income that pays for their housing allowance, food allowance and clothing allowance.    Section 8 people do not work for their housing allowance, nor do they have to claim it as income and pay taxes on it.  Nor do food stamp recipients have to work for their food stamps or claim it as income for tax purposes.     In some states, a welfare recipient is required to work for their check.  I don't think this is considered taxable income but I'm not sure.|`|THRtsl83aa	Sounds to me like it is just part of their pay for their service.  What service are welfare recipients providing to deserve stipends for rent?  None.  What service are soldiers providing?  Defense.

They don't want to spend money on the inner city because no cities vote for republicans.  They don't mind giving subsidies to farmer and rural people.  But they hate to give one cent to inner cities. People in the army vote republican so they find a way to say it is ok to pay for anything for them, but when it comes to a hispanic or black or white in the inner city its like Fck u.    Republicans only want to spend money on their base not whats good for america.  How can the cities which make all the jobs be any good when people can't buy bread?

Fletcher Class Destroyers at that time had the following armaments:    5 x 5 guns  10 x 40mm anti-aircraft guns  7 x 20mm anti-aircraft guns  10 x 21 torpedo tubes  6 depth charge launchers  2 depth charge racks  These were some of the older destroyers in the fleet at the time but a few were stationed at Naval Stations in Japan in 1968.|`|6ad710b1b3d9318af1b579f1f46ac105aa	A Submarine. A sub could gather the intel needed but unlike the pueblo could have submerged to make a get away. It would have been a lot harder for the North Koreans to have seized control of ship designed to sink, and would likely have increased the odds of Pueblo getting away.|`|4VzVfKvdaa	Things are not always black and white.  If you forget, we were sort of busy in Vietnam at the time so putting any kind of warship out there would have been an open invitation to someone other than North Korea...like maybe the Soviets.  The same would be said for a sub. Soviet subs (or at least one) were probably shadowing the Pueblo the whole time and would have helped the North Koreans...clandestinely capture Pueblo. The Pueblo was more than 50 miles away from North Korea when it was attacked...which by the way were a sub chaser and a torpedo boat that did the boarding.|`|9rhmeb7raa	The whole purpose of the ships of the Special Project Fleet was to present an appearance other than a warship off the coast of another nation. The ships were to look benign and non-threatening.   Most of the classified publications carried by Pueblo on her one and only patrol were phony! Designed to keep certain potential enemy states busy going through garbage while we developed a submarine-based electronic intelligence gathering platform. The two valid operations plans for that part of the world were "Operation Click Beetle", covering waters off China and Vietnam and "Operation Ichtyus" for waters off North Korea and the Soviet Union.  Pueblo's operation order was entitled "Operation Pink Root One". Any veteran can tell you what the pink root is and where it goes.  So, in short, Pueblo was set up to be captured!
obdew3HWaa	Congress refers to the whole of the legislative branch. This is composed by the Senate and the House of Representatives.     Legislative Branch - Enact laws of the land. This includes 'laws' as criminal law, appropriation 'laws' as in the federal budget, and many other types of laws  Executive Branch - Run the government. Execution of the budget.   Judicial Branch - Settle Disputes, Determine precedent, and enforce the law of the land.|`|7a86fd067480da0db6bb419cc2c63346aa	The three branches are the executive (President, VP, and cabinet), legislative (Congress), and the judicial (Supreme and other courts).    Congress is the Senate and House of Representatives combined.  Each state has two Senators.  Each district of a state elects a representative to the House - the number of districts depends on state population; thus, the number of representatives per state varies directly with population.  There is always a total of 435 House representatives.  Senators serve six-year terms, and House reps serve two-year terms.  Senate elections are spread so that there is an election every two years, in which one-third of the Senators are elected.  There is no term limit.    Senators and House representatives vote on bills and such.  The Senate is headed by the Vice President, who only casts a vote in the case of a tie.  The Senate also has other express powers such as electing the President in tie situations and voting whether or not to impeach the President.|`|S3ktbzDNaa	Congress is a general term for both the Senate and the House of Representatives.    The Senate has 2 members for every state. They are elected to 6 year terms. Every 2 years a third of them face re-election.    The House of Representatives has many more members. Members of the House represent a particular district within a state, not the whole state like the Senate. The number of members each state gets depends on it's population, it's not fixed like the House.    Big states like the House because they get more representation. Small states like the Senate because they are just as important as the big states. We have both as a compromise. To pass a law, each house of congress, the House and the Senate, must pass the law by a majority vote.|`|7TIw0wEcaa	The Senate uses Standard Representation, every state gets the same number of seats (2) and a Senator serves for six years.

AOaHaRvBaa	I think only you and God can answer that question.    You would have to go back to school for a masters degree and become an ordained minister in your faith.      As far as the Army goes (my service), you have to have a Masters in Theology or Divinity consisting of at least 72 hours (your church or seminary may require longer for such a degree).  You also have to have 2 years of ministry experience to enter active duty as a chaplain.  You can enter the Reserves/National Guard without this experience.    Pray about it and see where God is leading you.  Some experience as an engineer may turn out to be very beneficial for you later on as a chaplain.|`|AA10025824	I don't think there's much of a difference in which service you choose.  You'd have to look at the different positions and duties to see what you'd like best.  You'd definitely have a worthwhile job though and have the opportunity to have an effect on a lot of people.  Most people joining the military are young and away from home for the first time so you'd run into issues that would be unique from civilian experiences.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	That is a difficult question to answer. I would believe that someone who would want to be a Chaplain would have some desire to be in the service of GOD. Not saying that you don't but most people don't just become a Chaplain on the spur of the moment. I don't know your situation and definitely am not trying to talk you out of being a Chaplain. It's my intention to just bring about a process of being completely sure that being a Chaplain is something you feel you must do. If you become a Chaplain in the military you are going to have alot of people looking to you for spiritual guidance. Military service is a very difficult and rigorous aspect of earning a living and a Chaplains job is to help bring peace and better understanding of a service members life in God's plan for them. I think being a Chaplain is a difficult job in the military because you aren't a combatant and your responsible for completing all the military funerals in country as well as helping people cope with the aspect of having to kill. Make sure you are strong enough to be able to help us make it through our deployments and service requirements. Good luck.|`|bQKNjFqyaa	Have you been called by God to be a Chaplain? It's not just about hope and helping people, it's a calling.     Not to be mean, if you felt God has pulled you in this direction that's cool and you should go for it.     My husband was a Pastor before he reenlisted, and he looked into the Chaplaincy, we decided against it because you are very limited on what you can and can't say to people, since religion is considered so "offensive" these days. And we felt God calling him else ware. But We have been blessed to know some wonderful Chaplains that did nothing but help us and support and guide us, so if you feel called, you should go for it.

AA10464818	You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two FREE sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.    Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.    Note though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants.     Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs     The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.    For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant. Grants have objectives, and the grant applications that best captures the grant's objectives are approved.    There is a stringent review process through a committee composed of federal employees and selected experts in the field. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Zip Nancy Pelosi an email, she'll take care of it.|`|n21UVoQeaa	try this    http://www.freestuffpromo.com/grants

AA11117716	This would definitely be a plus.  If you are looking at using the military as an "in" for the firefighting field, you should consider the Navy or Coast Guard.  Every person who gets underway on a Navy or Coast Guard vessel is given hands-on firefighter training.  You are expected to be able to fight shipboard fires underway and provide basic first aid.  If you are able to get into the Health Services field while in one of these services - you're set.  You'll have what is essentially EMT and/or paramedic training, plus the ability to fight fires.    Also, if you are in the military and work with damage control or firefighting, consider going to the USMAP website (link available on your services advanced learning/education website).  You can use your military experience to earn civilian workforce qualifications, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor.  This would be a fantastic thing to check out for the firefighting field, as there are multiple firefighting-discipline certification programs available to military personnel.    As mentioned in above responses, prior military service always helps those applying for government jobs (in ANY field - even if not related to their military job).|`|ymNM6mmzaa	Yes.

Also your insurance could go up depending on the violation.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	Yes, it is the same as a ticket.  Somewhere you were caught on camera and the ticket sent.

He'll respect you a lot more than if you try to hide it from him.
AA10295984	He should get the punishment that is lined out by school policy. If the school policy says 3 days suspension, then that is what he should get. Unfortunately, when such a policy is set out, it must be carried out. Otherwise, the school runs the risk of losing a legal battle with the boy and his family.   However, you should file a police report. So should the other girls who were affected. You should also tell your parents exactly what is going on and that you do not think the punishment is appropriate.|`|XHmz4R99aa	I agree, you should get your friends and their respective parents together. File a police report, and get the parents to meet with the principal to discuss the matter.    I don't know what the guy should get in terms of punishment, but it should not be left hidden. Bring it out into the public and let everyone know. That in it self is a form of punishment. Like registering sex offenders. Hopefully it can be a detterent for him and other boys who is tempted to do the same thing.    If the school is not open to the idea, you can always file a lawsuit against the boy and/or the school. Sue the PANTS off of him. Again, it may not go very far in court, but it is a formal complaint and documented. It should bring some form of shame to him and his family too.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	He needs to go into therapy. He is going through a growing up phase and needs some expert therapist to straighten out his thinking now.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	I agree that he is probably going to be required to get some therapy, but that is not anyone's business but his own, and the school will never release that information.    You don't say how old you are, but if this freaks you out, maybe you can discuss it with the guidance counselor too. I think you can be put at ease quickly.    I highly suggest that constructive approach rather then confrontation and ostracizing. That won't help anyone and could get you in trouble too eventually.    Also, I might add that if the girls are old enough to be wearing bras, then for the rest of your life, most boys and even some girls are going to be interested in them and what is in them as sexual triggers.    I agree there are border issues here, but they will be taken care of promptly wrt the boy. Maybe depending on the type of school, border issues can be discussed or reinforced in general too. Maybe the school can also incorporate lessons about rumor control (" I heard he manipulated the system by saying he is going to kill himself")  but in the end, you are all in puberty/adolescence and weird things occasionally happen from that point on. You would do well to learn to not blow things out of proportion when they do.

M6n6VOFQaa	There are two definitions of republic, and whether you call a republic democracy depends on which definition you prefer.    One definition says that republicanism is simply the absence of monarchy. Thus, if a country's head of state (the ceremonial leader who calls legislatures into session, signs bills into laws, and greets foreign dignitaries) is chosen individually, rather than inheriting the office by being related by blood to the last chief of state, then that country is a republic. Under this definition, countries like China, Russia, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe are all republics: they have no king, queen, or emperor. Many former communist countries (like East Germany, a.k.a. the German Democratic Republic) called themselves republics.    A more restrictive definition of republic is embodied by this quote from the Oxford English Dictionary: "a state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives, and which has an elected or nominated president rather than a monarch." By this definition, only democratic states can be republics, since only in democracies can supreme power really rest with the people.    I tend to embrace the second definition; political scientists are split on the issue, and some comparative political science scholars say the label is less important than understanding how democratic a given country is or is not. If one uses the second definition, then all democracies are either republics or constitutional monarchies. All other countries are some variant of authoritarianism/autocracy.    Incidentally, people who say that republics are representative, while democracy means direct mob rule by the people, have no idea what they are talking about. Such definitions are rooted in Ancient Greece and Rome. In the modern world, political scientists -- who examine and define these terms -- identify democracies by the structures and behaviors of their governments. To wit, a democracy is a country where the political system shows the following traits:    * A government that comes into power through elections  * Elections that are frequent, free, fair, and competitive  * Guaranteed civil rights (the right to speak out, the right to assemble and petition, etc.)  * Guaranteed political rights (the right to vote, the right to run for office)  * A free press that it is independent of the government, and multiple sources of media information  * Accountability to the voters (through elections, recall mechanisms, polls, etc.)  * Government transparency (the government generally works in the open, and corruption is limited)  * Horizontal accountability between branches of government (checks and balances)  * Internally sovereign government (the government can act without an unelected force [like the military] preventing it from ruling)  * Near-universal adult suffrage (almost all citizens of age are allowed to vote, regardless of race, religion, etc.)  * Rule of law (the government cannot violate the constitution or basic laws at will)    Almost all democracies are representative. Only Switzerland comes close to a system of direct democracy, where the people make all decisions about enacting laws themselves. Direct democracy is generally practiced only by regional or local governments.    Oligarchy is a phrase that is used by lots of critics, especially from the political left, to decry the influence of corporatism, lobbyists, and special interests. More precisely, though, oligarchy means "rule by the few." In a proper democracy (like the US, UK, Germany, Japan, etc.), real power lies not with the legislatures and executives, but with the people, since the people have the power to change the leaders. Thus, real democracies represent "rule by all." Oligarchies involve small classes of people making decisions for all. The US was somewhat oligarchical in its formative years: woman and racial minorities could not vote; countries where only the rich may vote are also oligarchic. Military juntas -- where a cabal of generals run the country -- are another form of oligarchy.|`|Wn4d1DWiaa	No. in a democracy, people vote on individual issues. In a republic, people vote for representatives to vote for them. Its just a way to make democracy more efficient.
NqNbIp2caa	Funny - I have asked lots of questions about Obama and nobody has called me a racist.  Perhaps it is the questions you are asking|`|q4EXFhV7aa	You haven't asked a question about Obama yet...see your previous questions for my source. You did ask this question:   My girlfreind always says.....?  My asian girlfriend always says to me "I ruve you rong time" and "me so horny" but she always asks for money after i make love to her. Do you think she is being sincere or does she say it so i will lend her money?    From that, I can deduce that you are both kinda racist AND that you are about 12-14 years old.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	This isn't a question about Obama.  Its just a whining.

There is absolutely no law anywhere that states that a person must pay income tax.  The constitution provides for the collection of taxes on goods and services, and through some legal hokus-pokus, the government erroneously included income as a type of good or service.  Income taxes are collected to pay the interest on the money that the (also unconstitutional) Federal Reserve lends to the government.    A little research into the Federal Reserve will clear all of this up.  But I doubt if the dems are smart enough to know this.  They don't pay taxes because they think they're above the law (which doesn't exist in the first place).   That's what makes them crooks.|`|YqcU7O0Faa	To answer your question;    Very Few, almost makes me want to not pay my taxes as well since Barack Obama and company are setting such a fine example for all American taxpayers to follow.|`|b22d8ccedb447bfcc30483c3590f81f3aa	0 results found

Meaning that two thirds of the populace voted for NOT Hitler.    Anything more than two parties is a bad idea.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Unfortunately it won't be a good thing.

Fascism is the extreme left wing, and conversely Anarchism is the extreme right wing.  So the part of saying that it is under "Conservatism" is false.  Next, the people would stop by the time that it reached communism before reaching fascism and swing the pendulum back.    The range of political ideas are as follows, the first being the most leftist and the last being the most right:    Fascim---Communism--Socialism--Liberal... Capitalism--Conservatism--Libertarianism...|`|tvNkizDraa	I'd have to agree.  Those who might argue most strongly against such an idea might say "never without a fight".  Wrong, fascism is not limited to the takeover of industry by the government or even takeover of government by industry. It can be most easily accomplished by merger of government and industry... a merger done with money, not force, that buys the corporate influence with government.  Just take a look at where the US falls in the political spectrum:  http://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis...     One example of the merger is the number of lobbyists in DC that as of 2007 had more than doubled since 2000, and the amount they charged increased by as much as 100%.  An example of increased 'corporate rights' can be found in a Supreme Court ruling that favored the "free speech" rights of corporations and unions... against a provision of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law.  Another example can be found in the gobbling up of mass media outlets by less than a dozen conglomerates, with the assistance of the FCC and over the objections of the public and Congress.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...  -- 10 Facts Kevin Martin Doesnt Want You to Know About His New Media Ownership Rules  http://www.stopbigmedia.com/files/devil_...

They don't believe in small government, they want the government to enforce their morality, and they don't care about authoritarianism (just like religious extremists in the Middle East who support Islamic Law) ... their  1 compass is what their preacher tells them, and they want authoritarianism.      Oh and Fascism and Socialism have nothing to do with each other. Fascism is a form of government, Socialism is an economic policy.|`|8zelZj3Aaa	Your statement is not true, it isn't the conservatives doing it, it's the liberals and the direction is toward socialism rather than fascism.|`|1TJ5v6Xzaa	No.  Here's how:  Replacing the word "conservatism" with the word "liberalism" will make your statement true.    Conservatives believes that the working class should keep MORE of their own money.  Liberals/Fascists believes in "redistribution of wealth" or "Take your money and give to someone else, most likely the rich."    Conservatives believes in fighting a war until victory is achieved, install a self governing government, and get the hell home.  Liberals/Fascists believes in a police state until a negotiated win is achieved.  (which is an excuse to never leave)    Conservatives believes that the right to own a gun for protection and defense of his property and life.  Liberals/Fascists/communists believes in gun control.  Hitler, Stalin, and many other dictators had enforced gun control.    Oh, I could keep going, but I'm not because I am going to practice another conservative belief, my choice to do so.
AA10709853	yes.   several ways:     Enlist, then apply to STA-21.   the average sailor applies 4 times before being accepted.  you get a 4 year degree in  3 years max so the more credits you have the better your chances of being picked up.    Enlist then work your way up to Warrant or LDO.  neither program currently requires a degree, but they certainly help.   Warrants must be E7s, LDOs must be E6 and eligible to take the Chief's exam.  you also must be sh!t hot in your rating.      Enlist then get your degree on your own time, using TA, CLEP and other resources, then apply to OCS.      Enlist, serve your term, get out, use the GI Bill to get your degree,then apply to OCS.    Water is incorrect: you must have a Bachelors to seek a commission.  an Associates is not enough, although that woudl get you E3 if you enlist.|`|pfm0wcEIaa	Yes it is possible.  I don't know if you have talked to a Navy Recruiter but they can explain to you all the programs that they have for you to be able to do that.  The problem is that once you enlist, it turns out that it is not as simple or as easy as they portray it to be.  You can easily get kicked out of the programs that might allow you to do that.  Sometimes you have little control over this.    Keep in mind, a large number of people enlist with the expectation of becoming an officer and very few actually do.    With that said, my personal opinion is that it would be far easier for you to stick with school for another three semesters to get an associates and then join directly as a officer.

bQKNjFqyaa	Since your already in base housing and you are adding to your family you can put in a request for a larger house. They will help you find a new place on post or off, but you will have to move your own goods. The Gov won't do it for you. As far as how it works off post, each country is different, as far as electric and gas and water. But for finding a house your, housing office on base will have a list of approved houses for rent. And you will get BAH for the country you are living in, the same as if you chose to live off post in the states.      Congrats on the new baby!|`|4VzVfKvdaa	Don't take this the wrong way, but are you a Mormon or a blended family? It depends on where overseas you are going.  All base housing is not the same and neither are their policies as you have probably witnessed so far in your career. That being said, they do in most cases provide either adequate housing or help you find sufficient housing on the local economy.  The largest family housing I have ever seen overseas on base were 4-bedroom places.  However, I have seen a couple of instances where they put a large family (14 in fact once...8 of their own, 6 adopted special needs) in a duplex and knocked down an interior wall between them to accommodate the family. They lived in that base house for 3 years.  When they moved out, they simply put the wall back up. Most important thing for you to do is to get in touch with your gaining unit, 1st sergeant, sponsor, and housing office of where you are going to be stationed as soon as possible to inform them or your unique need.|`|tDZMJue9aa	thats pretty much your problem, they dont have to accommodate you and your large family what they can do if they cant meet your needs is ship your booty back to the us...i have seen this done...|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Not really,     If there are larger quarters on the base for your pay grade, you can apply for them.    But its not like they will put you on colonels row, just to give you a big enough house.    You will have to move off base to get larger housing, if you cannot get it on base.    As to it being expensive, you made the choice for the larger family, paying the extra expenses is part of the deal.|`|AA10709853	no they are not.   for one, the largest bedroom size ever available is 5.    they are strict about bedroom allotments and  allocation: under 6 share a room, under 12 same gender share a room and over 12  rate their own room.   if you have 'outgrown' that  allocation, that's YOUR problem, NOT the military's.      even if there there were 5 BR units available.. you still are required to get on the list.   and they may not put you on it until after the baby is born.  the BOTTOM of the list.  and the number of such units is usually less than 3% of all available housing anyway.    and like Bailie said.. more than once I saw families forcibly sent back CONUS from Japan for having too many kids.
AA12109395	Bureau of Vital Statistics in the County where the child was born.  You may be asked to prove that you are his legal guardian.|`|AA11622716	Go to the county where he was born.  It is recorded.  The agency is often called the health department or the bureau of vital statistics.  They have it and if you can give them a name, a date of birth an a couple bucks they will give you the certificate.|`|3ca2fafb859521c28fc6fa6f54821992aa	through the county department of records and live births.The county the baby was born in .|`|AA10620879	You are the grandparents so you are able to get the certificate for him  Just contact the County Dept of Health or State and fill out application. You will be required to provide proof of who you are and pay a fee. Each state charges differently. .|`|7ONKVbbiaa	You need to provide proof that you are now the court appointed legal guardian.   Contrary to what persons believe, anyone's birth certificate is restricted and you cannot just walk in and "buy it". Each state specifies limitations on who is authorized to a copy.   It is important to know who the other parent is? You say your "grandson's mother" but do not indicate that this is your daughter.
AFNgR9jTaa	Yes there are several ways to do it. OCS, officer candidate school and the Green to Gold program. Not to mention Warrant officers too.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	Have at least two years of college and volunteer for OCS  You will need to complete your 4 year degree before your original 6 year hitch is up.  That can be done by going to a SOC College or University.|`|AA10025824	There will be officer programs available.  You need a bachelors degree, but the Army will help you with that.
tHKRgH8Baa	It would not be a "bad" thing to do, I just wouldn't see it as beneficial.|`|esOaJoqBaa	Unless you really enjoy that sort of thing personally don't waste your money. If you end up doing a job that requires a lot of weapons usage then they will train you for it. The best thing you can do is get in shape and swim a lot.|`|a388e4e3066dcb4e1de9e18979b89ef0aa	just make sure you're in shape....weapons training will come....don't worry about it until you have other things under your belt....train with rifle unless you're gonna be a cop, then I suppose pistol would be "beneficial"    what would ypou want to pick up off the grouond, a 45 or an M16...I go M16|`|AFNgR9jTaa	I don't really see how it will help you at all in your training but sure go for it if you want to.
63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	The military frowns on people who do not pay their bills.  However because it is a medical bill if you appear to be making an effort to pay this I think they will otherwise consider you.  You can only find out for sure by visiting a recruiter. Go Marines.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	Yes, no problem.|`|Z0KQenm9aa	i would think the military would be empty if all bills had to be paid first... and why was the hospital bill so high just to remove your tonsils??? ( i had mine out when i was 20 and was not in long) that's nuts... you might ask the hospital administration if they would be willing to offer a consideration since you are going into the military... you know ... reduce the bill maybe... Godspeed|`|gQpoSC6Baa	yes.  if you don't want to pay the bill, then you should join, the french foreign legion instead.|`|VfjjojiAaa	Yes you can. And in fact, the military can help pay for them. If you join the national guard have someone "G-Wrap" you. There's an extra $2000. And if you go and complete boot camp...You'll get a $10,000 signing bonus AS SOON AS YOU FINISH SUMMER BOOT CAMP.   Also, the national guard will pay up to $25,000 in schooling or emergency financing...With no extra commissioning time.
gQpoSC6Baa	Canada has a military... i guess you are defending against penguins so something.
z88IMXNFaa	Typically, you only report stolen items.  If the police find it, they'll be in touch.|`|oFtwiquCaa	yes I would not call 911 but I would go and make a police report    and who knows you might just get it back
AA10295984	1. 25 years to Life imprisonment Without Parole. (Most states give 40-Life w/o).  2. Same  3. Same  4. Anywhere from a few months to life without parole, usually more than one year if he is 16 or older. It depends in large part on whether he is tried as an adult.  5. One to 10 years. If the man is under 16, he may do less than a year.    Bear in mind, there may be aggravating factors such as the use of a deadly weapon or firearm. There may also be other things to elevate the sentence such as prior convictions.
0cc280908f5890dc4f887659d66561b6aa	Israel is so intertwined with Judaism and it will never become a secular state to accommodate the Palestinians.|`|brUt1Fupaa	Probably for the similar reasons that Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Syria, etc. aren't secular states and deny non-Muslims their rights.|`|AA11622716	Because the Israeli government was set up as jewish state.  Of course one need not be jewish to be an Israeli citizen, and there are plenty of non-jews who live in Israel.  If you want to know why religion plays such a heavy role in the government, ask Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and all the other Islamic states in the region why they cannot be secular and stop denying jews their rights.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	It is a secular state. Religious leaders have no role in the government.    Palestinians in Israel DO have rights, far beyond those granted to Jews through the rest of the Middle East, or to Palestinians by their own "government" in their own territories.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Are you serious?  All the Muslim countries around them are far from secular and want to literally kill all the Jews.  At least Israel doesn't have a public policy of complete annihilation of the Muslims.
xaEcAgTqaa	You only need a study visa if you are enrolled in full-time study in the UK. If you are only coming for 3 weeks course, then you don't need a visa.    A visa national is a person that needs a visa to enter the UK for any purpose, including tourism. That list does not include US citizens, which may stay up to 6 months visa free.|`|TEyzimuYaa	Yes.
dUWqW27paa	I don't believe you have to disclose if it wasn't asked. If it was asked you have to be truthfull. I don't think there is a diff on your undies, recruit. You won't be needing them as they will poke and prod around down there.    BTW Good luck and thanks for your service. Which branch?    >>NEW|`|deSPSL46aa	They will ask if you've ever had stitches and will look you over for any major scars. You can wear boxers.     As for other important information: bring a book. a long one. you will spend 3/4 of the time sitting around.|`|X4kSnB4gaa	You can wear whatever kind of underwear you want, don't worry about that. No you don't have to tell them about stitches. I had a huge gash across my throat that had stitches only 4 months before I went to MEPS and it's in plain sight and it wasn't even mentioned.|`|zx8cVDqIaa	You can wear boxers, I watched a show about a US Carrier on deployment and I saw the pilot packing his boxers to go on land.|`|8C9yJ0Bwaa	Stitches, no you don't have to tell...      Just be ready for a loooong day. Took me almost 10 hours, I think. Say Yes/No Sir, Yes/No Ma'am when asked questions. Do what they say... :)    Talk to people when you go to the hotel the day before!   Make some friends
