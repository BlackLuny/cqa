I like to tie the plastic in a knot, instead of using the twist ties.  What about you?  Does it irritate you when other people rebel against your preffered method?  How do you preserve the bread?  Some people put it in the fridge, some people put it in the freezer (?), and some people (like me) just keep it out on the counter and let nature take its course.  All opinions welcome.

Okay, I'm not a cook, don't even like cooking, but you know how everyone & their dog has a "great recipe" for SOMETHING that they want to get out there & sell or make trillions of dollars for?   =o}   So, like everyone else, I have a recipe for chicken soup to die for! In fact many have died for it, it's sad really. Actually, everyone who's had it LOVES it & makes comments like "you have to bottle this & sell it" or "You should get this out on the market!"      So, I thought I'd ask, HOW? Seriously is there a way of marketing things like soup recipe's? Are there ever any recipe contests or something? I really don't know. I feel stupid for asking too, but I am asking.      10 points for best answer of course.

I ordered a rainbow roll from a sushi restaurant the other day, and there's a particular type of fish (I assume it's fish) that I couldn't identify. I've also had it as sashimi. It's white, with distinct parallel indented lines running in one direction. The texture is a quite chewy. A cross-section would look a little like this: ^^^^^^.

Can anyone confirm this to be true?

20090305034712AAhLN3F	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	I have been having alocohol habit for 7 years. Now i want to quit. Need some help..?	Hi all,      I have been having drinking habit for 7 years. Among it, last 5 years i have been drinking weekly 3 to 4 days. Beer, rum, brandy whiskey and so on. Normally if i drink beer i will drink 2 beers(each has 650 ml) . Most of the time i used to mix beer and rum.      So many times i feel guilty. bec after boozing i blabber. if will forget what i spoke yesterday.       I am educated. working as a software engineer. I would like to take this drink moderately. monthly once. Normally when i drink, i use side dish as chicken and some non veg. 2 weeks back i felt my heart was paining a bit. That day itself i am getting scared. I consulted the doctor.      They said, this is due to gastric prob. Ur pulse, pressure all are fine. since u r young, u no need to be worried. They told me to stop smoking and reduce alcohol intake.      my age is now 24. Can i recover my health if i stop drinking and smoking. what are the things i have to do for it.      Need some valuable suggestion.
