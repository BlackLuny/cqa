20090306215943AAN4Vx5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	In the Old Testament God obviously condoned multiple wives and concubines. What changed?	This question is intended for the Biblical Literalists who say that God condoned incest for a few generations with Adam & Eve's children and again for Noah & Co due to the low population requiring it. But multiple wives and concubines continued long after the population was large, and would do nothing to increase the population faster than one man for one woman. Now most of you likely feel a man having dozens of wives would be a sin (even trying to legally define marriage as being between "one man and one woman" based on your interpretation of the Bible).      So what changed to make God no longer condone multiple partners for well-to-do men?

20090306221432AA2gqnk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Where is this verse? i cant find it?	Love is patient, Love is kind,   It does not envy, it does not boast,   It is not proud, it is not rude,   It is not self-seeking,   It is not easily angered,   It keeps no record of wrongs.      Love does not delight in evil,   but rejoices with the truth.      Love always protects, always trusts,   always hopes, always perseveres.      Love bears all things, believes all things,   hopes all things, endures all things.      Love never ends.      Lover never fails

20090306224349AAVVxrX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is the purpose of life?	I know the answer.  This is to make people think.   We were all created.  And we will all die.   We have been given reason, and we have been given choice.   Everything here will be gone.  Never to come back.      What is the point?      Life on facts.  Life on evidence.   Life is short- don't waste your effort on work money relationships and sleep.  All the will be gone.  There's a bigger picture.  It is obvious that the God who created us handles the world for us.  Maybe it's turning bad because we forgot OUR mission?      Question yourself before Allah questions you.   We were all created from the same God who created a perfect universe.  Would that creator leave all of humanity to argue about a book that He sent becuase of corruption?  Or is that just a sign for us, and there actually is a book that there is no arguement against.      1400 years ago   Not one letter changed   Not one contradiction   All for one reason-worship God   Everything in it proven to be accurate concerning history, science, and human mind.      A child hates medicine because he doesn't understand it.  But he later takes it because he needs it.      Broaden your knowledge.  Self reflect.  Think.  Remember.  Life is short.  Question yourself before you are questioned.  God is watching you.  Do not be afraid to ask.  Do not be afraid of anything but God.  Because we will all die.      Broaden your knowledge and live on evidence and truth.      Again.  What is the purpose of life?
20090307001746AADqLN2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	He's called an "apostle" and a "saint." What was the vetting process for Paul/Saul?	Paul said: "Christ died for our sins."       But Christ said: "I will have mercy and not sacrifice." He was quoting Hosea 6:6 which appears to be a condemnation of the idea of sacrifice for sins. And faced with the merchants selling doves for sacrifice, Christ forcefully overturned their benches!      How is it that a person who was not one of the 12 Apostles got the title of "Apostle" and got his words elevated to the status of "Gospel of Jesus Christ?" Who decided that a person who was not an apostle was one? Which church official started calling him a saint when the Bible tells of his dangerous violent personality?      Is it a bit of a stretch to say that he went form sinner to saint in one instant?

I know that we can not end our own life and go to Heaven, but in this passage of the Bible God helps Samson commit Suicide. Was he a tool of God to bring his people out of oppression and so still go to Heaven? just something i would like other opinions on. Thanks      Jdg 16:28  And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.    Jdg 16:29  And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.    Jdg 16:30  And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.

Look at Africa.

A child dies every 3 seconds    http://www.unicef.org/mdg/childmortality...       And we just don't seem to care.       And we're worried about what? No matter what happens to us there is no way we are going to end up worse than those people. Maybe a depression would be a good thing. It would give us some time to get in touch with reality. Our core society isn't going to disintegrate. And if your earnings are on the upper end of the financial spectrum, well, even in the Great Depression 40% of people continued their lives completely unaffected.      What a depression could actually look like: "...above all, a depression circa 2009 might be a less visible and more isolating experience. With the diminishing price of televisions and the proliferation of channels, it's getting easier and easier to kill time alone, and free time is one thing a 21st-century depression would create in abundance. Instead of dusty farm families, the icon of a modern-day depression might be something as subtle as the flickering glow of millions of televisions glimpsed through living room windows, as the nation's unemployed sit at home filling their days with the cheapest form of distraction available.      The odds are, most economists say, we will yet avoid a full-blown depression - the world's policy makers, they argue, have learned enough not to repeat the mistakes of the 1930s...."       http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/...

20090307015804AAYVQcH	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is it strange that I only found out that racism against blacks still existed when I was 13?	I was aware that it existed against Muslims because of the 9/11 attacks and the array of other Middle Eastern issues.      But I sincerely believed that black-white racism was a thing of the past. Perhaps it's because I live in an ethnically diverse area?       But even then I tried to deny myself the truth, because I did not want to let such a negative image of America and the "accepting progressive" world into my mind. And then I realized that white supremacist groups such as skinheads still existed after the kkk threatened Obama before he was elected. I am not even a Democrat but I was shocked upon hearing this.       To what extent do you think racism like this still exists?

I feel like other christians (like my family & people at church/on yahoo answers) are WAY better than me and I'm a fraud. When a person tells me about God or gives me good advice on trusting him, they sound so wise. When I try to do it, (to me) I sound cheesy & I doubt if it helped anybody.       Although I believe in God & Jesus and have ask them to be my savior, I believe you can ruin your chance at salvation (although others have told me that you can't). Thus, I'm slowly starting to think that I've done just that, as I let God down again by turning to porn (not today, but recently) instead of him to try & ease my worries.

When a coworker pissed me off, I yelled at her and was verbally abusive. mgt informally warned me when they coulda let me go. But no, I just had to think I'm right and my coworker's wrong.

One of them had a child with her and reported me. Next thing I know, I was canned for workplace violence. Basically, I endangered everyone at the fitting room bc ceiling tiles coulda fallen and hit someone. How could I take back what I did at work and erase it? I don't mean my record. I mean erase it so that it never happened.      Because right now, I'm having a hard time finding another job and I like where I worked.

20090307013117AAVfY4e	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Is it possible that ghosts are lifeforms our senses can't pick up?	Basically when people say they see ghosts could it be other lifeforms on earth that co-exist with us and that these people have more honed senses. For instance of our five senses we have a limits, such as we can't hear under 40 DB, we can't see atoms with our eyes etc.      p.s. i don't mean cold spots in rooms for ghost, or reasons that can easily be explained by science.

20090307014959AADOuHA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is Hinduism the one true religion, whilst many others are glorified cults?	What are your opinions? Being a Hindu is a privilege. It is also the oldest religion. If you look at some of the other religions, they pretty much state if you are not a part of our religion you are going to hell e.g. Islam, Christianity. Also note that anyone can become a member of these religions, and they have people around the world forcing these religions on the public i.e. they are like cults. In terms of Hinduism, you can only be a Hindu if you are born a Hindu i.e. you cannot convert, nor do we force others to become Hindus. Moreover, the mantra is chillaxed i.e.  be a good person, and life will be cool. No OCD based practices like praying 5 times a day, or giving up Sunday mornings, or nuking non-Hindus in the name of religion.

20090307005218AAURLnB	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	I ono how to feel about her...?	Three years ago i met this girl, over summer break. My best friend at the time introduced me. She was a junior lifeguard so she was always around during the day, we were helping coach little kids how to sail at the time. July 4th, her parents made her sleep on the trampoline of her family's catamaran, it was a cold night, so we told her to stay with us on our buddy's boat, so she did. Everyone knew we liked eachother but that is as far is it got. (btw we live half an hour away from eachother and obviously go to different schools). When school started we stopped talking, she got a boyfriend(I'll say it now, we were Sophmores, and the new boyfriend was a senior, which struck me as weird to begin with). This november i saw her again, her family was going through some financial troubles, but she ended being "forgotten" at the club by her parents so i told her to stay on my boat with me and my buddy, he slept in the quarter birth in the back and we slept in the salon, big bed, but we were close. Then over the next few weeks we started talking on the phone and txting a lot. One weekend in fact, probably the best weekend of my life, there was a regatta her family was sailing in, they made her stay on the boat they were racing, but she slept with me again, we went to the ***** sat night and layed there for an hour in the cold, there was another kid too but he wanted to surf in the morning, we ended up going back to my boat where we had our first kiss(cute right? shush don't make fun of me) then sunday night we went and watched the sunset with some people, good weekend imo. Then the new season of Psyche started, so every friday we would watch that together, good show heh. Over christmas break we went snowboarding twice and sledding once. Christmas we hung out, and i spent the night at her house on new years, then the next day. but after that she got busy. and we stopped talking, we havent seen eachother since then, and for some reason we keep getting in arguments b/c of it :/. However, we have a bunch in common, and i keep telling myself, and her that i don't care that she's busy i can wait to see her b/c i know when we do it will be fun. However when we do get in fights i can't listen to music or watch certain shows because i watched them/ listened to them when i was talking to her and enjoyed it a lot.      I don't know, she says she wants to break up because she's so busy, but i don't want to or that i will wait until she isn't busy, heh i even asked her to prom, but sadly she said she would go with me in her dress from last year. btw did i mention that her ex is now a freshmen in college, we're juniors in High School,(also if i ever saw him i feel like i would have to break his face in, even though it would probably only hurt my situation with her) and that after he broke up with her he tried to ask her out again and told her he loved her, she said no, which is about when we started to see eachother again. She keeps telling me that she loves him but she likes me more... what does that mean too.      So if you can can you please tell me how i feel about her, i can't decide because everytime i come to a conclusion something happens to change my mind, also can you tell me what she loves her ex but likes me more means... i don't understand... thanks a lot :)      P.S. sorry this is so long, lots of info for you to help me the best you can.

20090307033219AAR1hRm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Who is the real architect of language variety, we are told this happened at the Tower of Babel, read more?	I read and or Speak, English, German, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Hebrew, Ancient Egyptian, and speak some Japanese, Vietnamese, French, Greek and Latin. and have studied some of the elements and functions of many others.      Personally I would not say that that I have mastered any language, but I am acquainted with all these languages enough to see that they all seem related, with the exception of Japanese which is an offshoot of Chinese, and seems to arrive from an independent origin.      As for Hebrew and Ancient Egyptian they fall in to the category of Semitic languages.   the others are in the category known as Latin root languages.      When you compare, Egyptian Hieroglyph, Phoenician, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin there is more than a passing resemblance among them. They can be seen to be related easily after looking at them for a while.      Since I doubt God altered the language and rather think men did this, my question is this,       What would be the benefit for God or man of making it difficult for all people to communicate easily with one another?      All are welcome to answer, but be rational if possible, diverse languages are not an accident regardless if they were enacted by God or man.
20090307031648AAbES62	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	My Atheist friends:  Man is material, God is immaterial.  So how would you get proof by material means?	Sincerely, I call you friends because I do not say Atheist in a bad way.  But please consider that if God is immaterial how could you find Him with a meter, or a scope, or anything with which we measure the material world?  Fair question.        Also if you will be kind enough to consider:   If man did see an appearance of God that would be the material coming in contact with the immaterial.  Wouldnt that be like matter colliding with anti matter?      Maybe that is why Moses hair turned white.  And could also explain the great fear experienced by all who claimed to see God.           If you saw into another dimension even briefly wouldnt you be scared?   I would.         So Im not long a boring---consider how can you measure proof of the immaterial by material means?               Science proves more and more things every year that we cannot touch taste or even see with our senses alone, and we find more and more out there.

I write down in my resume about that experience but I do not conclude in the resume that my experience is gotten from non-profit organization (non payment). All of the employers and job agents seem lose their mood after knowing that what I am doing is just a volunteer experience. However I learn a lot from that company and I have devoted 1 year managing the accounting system there. I looking for paid job for 3 months already, but no one is interested with the volunteer experience although I applied for junior level

20090307034603AAZhsso	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Vipasanna Meditation - How to observe the breath?	I am starting with Vipassana meditation.      The basic technique is to put your attention to your nostrils and observe the breath going in and out.      What I have problems with, though, is that I can't really let the breath "be by its own". So every time I put attention to my nostrils I need to breathe consciously as compared to me breathing doing something else.       What can I do to let go of that conscious control?    Or do it simply need to practice putting yet more attention to my nostrils?   Is Vipassana possibly not suited for me? Should I instead rather try to focus on a different object like a candle?      Thank you

20090307000423AAkyStJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Has anyone ever wondered that their belief in God comes from growing up around people that believe in him?	If you had grown up in eastern Asia, you probably would follow Buddhism. If you had grown up in the Middle East, you might be Muslim. if you had grown up in India, you might be a Hindu. This isn't to say it would be guaranteed, its only to say that more than likely this is what you would follow.      Has God ever came down and told anyone who is the real religion? Christians believe Jesus is the Son of God. Jews don't believe that the Messiah has come back yet. Muslims believe there is only one God, and that saying Jesus is his Son is polytheism. Hindus believe in more than one God. Who's to say who is right? It seems religion is simply pick and choose which you like the best and go with that one.      I came to the conclusion that the only reason I believe in God is that someone else told me to. I believe Jesus is the Son of God because someone else told me he was. All of my beliefs are predicated on what someone told me. God loves me because someone else told me he does. Jesus died for my sins because a preacher told me it was in a book. Notice God or Jesus never told me any of this. I have to depend on a human being.      And one more thing: my grandmother has always told me to take God with me and he will protect me. Someone can come into your room right now and shoot you in the head. Where would the protection be? And she says God answers prayers. What about the prayers of amputees? Where is this "power" that I have been told about my whole life? I'm just tired of believing things simply because someone else told me to.

My little girl is 6 weeks old and half Japanese, we live in Japan, my husband is Japanese and i am British.       Here in Japan they have a ceremony when the baby is 100 days old, kind of like a christening, and in this ceremony she would have to eat solid food for the first time - however anyone with children knows that now peds say you should NOT give solids to babies until 4-6 months.   (Personally i had never intended to start her on solids until 6 months!)      I dont want to put my little girls health at risk, and do this ceremony, but i know if i say no my in laws will freak out.    Actually the ceremony part i dont mind - im all for her being raised with 2 cultures traditions - its the force feeding i dont like.      What should i do? They dont buy the "shouldnt eat solids until 6months" argument because they did the ceremony to their kids, and started them on solids at 3 months etc.       Any suggestions?

Around other people, I always feel like I'm doing something wrong—like I'm standing in the wrong place or sitting in the wrong way, or doing something I'm not supposed to, or looking at the wrong thing, or I walk too fast, or too slow, or too upright, or too slouched. I mean, I've dealt with it for most of my life, but I'm nearing the end of my high school experience and I'm quite sick of this feeling of awkwardness plaguing me constantly. I'm know I'm not the center of everybody's landscape and most people don't even notice me, but there are some situations where I honestly can't say that, where I'm thrust into social situations and the feeling is particularly problematic then. If you have any advice to help me get over my physical awkwardness, I would appreciate it.

20090307041806AAGQBdG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is it important to acknowledge Jesus as "The Lamb of God"?	John The Baptist seeing Jesus approaching said:  "Behold The Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world".   Whether there are 3 or 33 "persons" in The Godhead, only ONE bled and died on the cross for the salvation of mankind, crying out: "My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me?"   It is in His Name and by His blood that we must be saved.     Baptism with the titles of The Trinity strips away the Name, blood and pre-eminence of Jesus, leaving the subject dead in his sins. (95% of believers)  This is tragic and no Christian can be happy about that !!   Mat 28:19 must be read with 28:18 and understood:  "All power/authority in heaven and earth is given unto me.  Go THEREFORE to all nations teaching and baptising (with the authority of The Father, Son and Holy Ghost)  The Apostles reaffirm this with: " All the fullness of The Godhead dwelleth in Him bodily and you are complete in Him who is the head of all principality and power."   Is there scripture which says they were condemned because they did not believe in The Trinity?  No.   Is there scripture which says:  "They were condemned because they did not believe in The Name of The Only Begotten Son of God".  Yes.

Tell me how YOU feel, not how you think other people feel. Personally, I love the idea of being an infinitesimal part of an incomprehensibly vast and ancient universe, but I can see the poetry inherent in the younger, smaller universe.      I'm not asking which you think is real or true. I'm just curious which you like. I personally think that the small, young universe is really cool, but I like being part of the gigantic, old universe better.      The universe is gonna be what it's gonna be, so don't bother telling us why your view is right and everybody else's is wrong. I just think it would be cool to know what you think is cool. (If you want to tell people your religious status, go ahead, but it's not really the crux of the question.)

First of all, I love God, and Jesus, I believe in them, but I am just so confused. I believe in heaven, but I found myself looking at the wiccan religion, and I was scared, I don't want to be a wiccan, but I did like how it said it was centered around nature, But once again, I love God. But I have so many really close friends who are atheists I think, and don't believe in God, so they're always talking about how there isn't one, and I do believe there is, but I am just so confused. My family doesn't go to church, but we are a christian family, we pray on christmas and thanksgiving and Easter, and other important holidays, and when we do go to church its a methodist church. I don't want to doubt God, but when I went to church, I didn't feel as connected as everyone else, I don't know why. I strongly believe in homosexual rights, and I want to find a christian religion that allows that, or at least isn't totally against it. I would go to a pastor at a church, and talk to them, but once again I don't go to one, so I can't. Can anyone help me understand my thoughts please? I'm so scared, it feels like I'm sinning for looking at these wiccan websites, which I don't want to, I love God so, so much, and I want forgiveness, I just am so confused,      Help, please.

20090306210256AAdL1VA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists:A question of morality?	Atheists, how do you decide what moral code to live your life by? I'm not asking you to explain morality, maybe it did evolve to help humans live in communities. However, that does not eliminate the question of whether there is morality in the world or not. Morality is not inherrent in the laws of science. Animals often destroy weaker animals to increase their chances of success.    You might say, i just treat people the way i want to be treated. However, what are you basing that on? I'll give you a hint, religious philisophy.    If you say, there is no morality, then you are saying that if you see a baby lying in the street, you are not morally obligated to help it (even though you could increase your own biological fitness by eating the baby, bears do it all the time)   The truth is, practically everybody agress that there should be some moral code. Atheists just like to ignore the fact that most of their values come from the judeo-christian society in which they live. There is no way to define a "good" or "bad" deed without some external judgement system. after all, if hitler wanted to kill Jews, what right do we have to judge him. If your neighbor is abusing his child, what makes that action wrong?      i bet most of you cowards will not answer my question, but refer to something like, religion has caused more war,etc, by the way, does not only answer the question, but proves my point. You are making a moral judgement based on good and evil.

She told her to shut up and she's told other people to shut up when she was told her front yard was messy.      My cousin stopped talking to her to avoid further confrontations.  The old lady would spread rumors about how mean my cousin is things like, she doesn't like anybody in her yard, she doesn't like to this and that when it's not true.  Since they don't own the land, anybody could park on the sidewalk, one time she told my cousin's husband that he couldn't park there and she called him rude, when he ignored her.

20090307014617AAENOHQ	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Help In Making A Decision for School!! Read!!?	Ok everybody i go to a school. i think its great. it has one of the best football teams in the region and my grade has a really good chance of making it undefeated next year in 9th grade, i love football and i currently do track and sports is almost like my life. I love the school i go to and i have lots of friends, im popular, and not trying to brag but i do better than most people at sports than others. But one thing im not liking is well my grades. sometimes it seems like some stuff is really hard like in pre algebra and i just cant seem to do homework. like i have time to do homework and its just i dont feel like it because i can be lazy sometimes and well i tend to waste time and play on xbox live and text. i could get great grades in pretty much every class but i cant get my mind of other stuff like sports, friends, girls. you know the stuff boys think about in jr high at 14 years old. well this school really close to mine is well i heard it isnt as hard. like the education curriculum isnt as hard as my school. and i have friends at that school to but i dont want to feel dumb you know. like here is an example. My teacher at my school has a son who a couple years ago graduated and this girl who was the whatever its called class valedictorian well anyways the girl went to college and everything but she ended up having to take like basic classes in college because the school i want to go to doesnt teach as well  i guess? does that mean the school is dumb or somethin or should i go there just because the grades are easier and i have friends there?/ im confused.

I'm a very open-minded and intelligent 14 year old. ( You may see by my best answers that I lied, I don't think its age that matters; its a number, it shouldn't mark how smart or how far you are in life... ) So I'd definitely like to know the answer..  Also what about different Religions what happens after their death? As you can obviously see I have a lot of questions, and I'd like a lot of answers... And its not like I haven't asked a priest, a close friend, or a parent. They all went silent after " Then What " except my friend who Simply said " I don't know " ...

If I had to choose between letting an angry mob rape two angels or my two daughters, then I'm sorry but the angels are screwed (literally).

Secondly, I thought humans were a superior creation to angels in God's eyes.  If that's so, why should I give up my girls to protect a lower lifeform?  Especially when angels are supposed to be protectors and warriors for God.  In my opinion, the score should be humans 2, angels 0.

20090307035855AAC8b3i	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do religious people find the idea of a random, uncontrolled universe a preposterous notion?	Even though if we apply Occam’s razor to the question of ‘Is there a higher power or is it a random universe?’ the simplest explanation is that it is indeed a completely random universe and there is no evidence to prove otherwise. See, religious people believe that there is a higher power and they attach all these other characteristics and concepts to their belief in a higher power, like, this higher power made the universe, it made people, it made a place where good people go when they die and a place where bad people go when they die. Their rejection of a random universe and belief in a higher power gets more and more complicated the deeper one looks into it and creates more questions than it answers. What is so scary about a random universe that people invent these bizarre stories and impossible fairytales to believe in instead of accepting the truth?

20090307023020AAF7q2E	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	News article suggests brain differences between believers and non-believers... ignorance is bliss?	Source:  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...       ScienceDaily (Mar. 5, 2009) — Believing in God can help block anxiety and minimize stress, according to new University of Toronto research that shows distinct brain differences between believers and non-believers.      Compared to non-believers, the religious participants showed significantly less activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a portion of the brain that helps modify behavior by signaling when attention and control are needed, usually as a result of some anxiety-producing event like making a mistake. The stronger their religious zeal and the more they believed in God, the less their ACC fired in response to their own errors, and the fewer errors they made.      You could think of this part of the brain like a cortical alarm bell that rings when an individual has just made a mistake or experiences uncertainty," says lead author Inzlicht, who teaches and conducts research at the University of Toronto Scarborough. "We found that religious people or even people who simply believe in the existence of God show significantly less brain activity in relation to their own errors. They're much less anxious and feel less stressed when they have made an error."

We are both studying master’s degrees. We exchanged email and phone contact information. She would usually invite me over to her place for coffee. We would talk, chill, and watch a movie for a few hours. Oneday, she seemed in need of emotional support. She invited me in her bed. We started kissing, holding hands, and cuddling. However, we had no sex. Anyways, we still hung out together. She told me that she was divorced and has a child from a previous marriage. I still enjoy her company. The past month was quite busy due to end of term assignments. I called her last week when I was done my assignments. She sounded happy to talk to me. She definitely said that she wanted to meet and properly catch up. She said she would call. She said that she has been doing research in the library for a main research paper. Then she went home for a few days. I literally talked with her last week. Should I wait for her to call me or should I just give a casual call next week?

His mother, a church going christian, breaks into my house and steals toys, clothes etc from my kids that she had given as gifts.  she also takes personal items from me such as songs and poems I have written over the course of 25 yrs.  I even went so far as to call her and BEG her to not do this, that we should handle this in as peacably a fashion as possible. Most the people in this county, disagree with what she did, (in our christian church going circles) but refuse to get envolved or even help by giving my kids blankets, because they dont want to make her mad at them.      where are all the christians at?
20090307024336AAs23Ug	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question re Jehovah's Witnesses teaching on the Judgment Day...?	Please CAREFULLY read and consider the following -      The Watchtower Society teach that on the "day" of judgment, people will not be accountable to God for sins committed prior to their death and resurrection.      I quote,      "According to the apostle John's vision, 'scrolls were opened,' and 'the dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.' Are these scrolls the record of people's past deeds? NO, THE JUDGMENT WILL NOT FOCUS ON WHAT PEOPLE DID BEFORE THEY DIED. How do we know that? The Bible says: 'He who has died has been acquitted from his sin.' (Romans 6:7) Those resurrected thus come to life WITH A CLEAN SLATE, SO TO SPEAK." - What Does the Bible Really Teach? Pg. 214 (caps for emphasis)      First point -       The CONTEXT of the Romans 6:7 quote, concerns the METAPHORICAL death of the believer in Christ, to the dominating power of sin in his life.      Romans 6:2 - "May it never be! How shall we who DIED to sin still live in it?" (caps mine)      Romans 6:8 - "Now if we have DIED with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him." (caps mine)      Romans 6:11 - "Even so, consider yourselves to be DEAD to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus." (caps mine)      Were the Roman Christians ACTUALLY dead? Of course not. They had METAPHORICALLY died (to sin), and as 6:7 states,       "for he who has died is freed from sin." (NASB)      That is, freed from it's dominating power.       Second point,      AND QUESTION -      If, as the WT teach, people will not give an account to God for their pre-resurrection deeds,       why is it Paul writes to the Roman Christians in chapter 14, verse 12, that,      "So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God."      CLEARLY in reference to their CURRENT, PRE-RESURRECTION DEEDS, specifically, passing judgment on the opinions of those weak in faith, and regarding such with contempt (verses 1, 10)?      Is there not a clear contradiction of Paul's doctrine present in the aforementioned WT teaching?      Thanks in advance for your time.      x

These ecclesial Communities which, specifically because of the absence of the sacramental priesthood, have not preserved the genuine and integral substance of the Eucharistic Mystery cannot, according to Catholic doctrine, be called 'Churches' in the proper sense"      How do you feel knowing that there is no such thing as a Protestant church?

Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.      5. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.      13.  For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.      14.  For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect;      15.  Because the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no transgression.      16.  "Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end of the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all.      17  (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations.)      It sounds to me all of you work to pay debt, your faith is not in God, but the world and works of your hands.  If ones faith is truly in God, ones faith sees him through all obstacles of life, such as what is before us.      Those who need laws to follow worketh wrath in the eyes of God, while those who can live without laws, there is no transgression.      Faith is the key to the kingdom of God.  Not the work we do with our hands.  God created this earth, but man created the world we live in.      Would like others input who are opened minded about scriptures.
20090307035903AAnF9tL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What say you all about these scriptures; 1 Corinthians 7; 13-16.?	1 Corinthians; 7; 13-16.      13.  And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not,and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.      14.  For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children were unclean; but now are they holy.      15.  But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart.  A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases but God hath called us to peace.      16.  For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save they wife?      What this says to me, is that marriage is not eternal or forever unless both are believers.  God doesn't care who marries or separates.  For God alone, judges who is sanctified and who isn't.  We are to live our life in God the best we can, no matter who we marry or separate ourselves from.      Would like other opinions.

20090307041727AAXUcJ1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I just have five questions to ask?	1. In John 8:17-18: "It is written in your (?) law that the testimony of two men is true. I am one, that bears witness of myself; and the Father that sent me bears witness of me."       But the Law says no one can bear witness to himself or against himself! Two reliable witnesses beside himself are required. How could Jesus bear witness of Himself & proceeded as if it were lawful?      Did Jesus try to change/break the Law at this point?         2. In John 5:37: "And the Father himself which has sent me has borne witness of me. You have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His shape"      But Deuteronomy 5:19-21 says that they heard God the Father & saw His glory. Moses was shown God's back, which means Moses in fact saw God's shape.      Deuteronomy 5:19-21 "These words YHVH spoke to all your assembly in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud and thick darkness with a great voice.... and you said: 'behold YHVH our almighty has shown us His glory and greatness and we have heard His voice... we have seen today that the Almighty does speak with man, and he (man) lives!"       3.In Romans 4:13: "For the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or his seed through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith"!      But (Genesis 26:3-5) says -    "And I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father; and I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and will give to your seed all these lands, and by (mentioning) your seed (as an example) shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves; because Abraham hearkened to my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws"!! (Genesis 26:3-5)      4. In Romans 5:13: "for until the law (before Sinai!) sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law"!      If sin is not imputed when there is no law, i.e. before Moses received YHVH's Law on Sinai, why did He destroy Sodom and Gommorah etc. etc.??      5. In Luke 1:69-71: "and hath raised up a horn of salvation (Jesus) for us in the house of his servant David... that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us"!      But where did Jesus save them from Romans?      Explain please

20090227132247AAB6olC	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	To all post-opt transsexuals: How and when do you know that transitioning is the right thing to do?	I struggle with this question every day.  I know that I have gender issues, some of my earliest memories are of feeling like I was in the wrong body. I have fought and struggled with these feelings, of something not being right with me all my life . I have tried to do macho manly things. I have tried to be the best man I can be, but still I am haunted daily with the sense that something is not right, I am supposed to be a woman.     I now find myself in my early forties, married to a wonderful lady, and father to a great son who adores me. In a good career, living in a small conservative southern town, (which just happens to be my home town).  My wife knows of my condition and is sympathetic but has made it clear that if I transition she will divorce me and take my son away. That is a big issue for me I love my son, I want to see him grow up to be a good person and intelligent person not like the redneck bible thumpers that populate this town.  Physical my body looks very masculine, so I worry that even with hormones I will not be very passable. So, basically I have a decent  life but I cannot ignore these feeling inside of me, that of being in the wrong body.    I do not wish to move as backwards as this town is, it is my home, and my family is her. I have a good career but I am not rich, I will not have the money to hire a good divorce attorney, on the other hand my wife's family is very wealthy. I will not have the money to afford the surgeries I will need to transition.  So the question becomes do I give all of that up to transition? Will my life be better after transitioning?

Part of my small learning disability is social interaction with people.       For example if I get invited to a party I will usually walk around the party alone. Others will be able to pick up and engage in conversations. I will talk to people and they will back away from me.      Even though I got a college degree 5 years ago in Radio-TV-Film its time to apply for SSI and Medicaid.             I also have mild Tourettes and CP.

I was always taught that anyone who had never heard of Jesus or was unable to understand about Jesus (such as very young children) was "saved by grace" and would therefore go to heaven, no matter what.  If that's true, wouldn't it be better to not tell anyone about Jesus at all?  I mean, you can't deny the guy if you've never heard of him and that way everyone goes to heaven.  Not trying to be a smart@ss.  Just wanted to know your opinions...

Lille clutched at the wall with her sweaty, clammy hands, trying not to pass out. She didn't know where she was. "I must be hallucinating," she though. But she wasn't. This was real. Her mom was walking toward her, her arms open and tears streaming down her face. Except, except this wasn't the mom she remembered. Her mom had a warm demeanor like a crackling fire on a chilly day. This woman was cold and awful. She was whiter than a snowflake falling on the ground. Lille started shouting, except no words came out. She had gone deaf and mute at the same time. All she could hear was a familiar sound, so distant that it was barely recognizable. It would have been all for the better if this song was indistinguishable. For, at that moment, Lille knew what that tune was as her mom clutched her with her thin hands. "Why are you doing this to me?!" Lille shouted as she realized that her voice had come back to her

20090307051931AAHowOp	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do white people have to watch what they say, but anyother race can say anything they want?	Why is that black people, and immigrants can say w/e they want about white people, and it's just "speaking their minds" but when a white person says something against blacks, or immigrants it's being "Racist".  Their "civil leaders" like Jesse Jackson preach they want equality, but with one hand they promote black only subjects, and with the other judges white people.  I'll give some examples on the "equality" we've reached.  In Toronto, Ontario they opened a black only school last year....can you imagine a WHITE ONLY school? NEVER going to happen...oh wait we had white only schools, but they were racist, and shut down, right?  A couple months ago Tyra Banks had an episode devoted to black women, and only let black women in on the show....Can you imagine Dr. Phil having an episode devoted to White Men, and only let white men in?  NEVER going to happen.  BET channel is cool, a WET (white entertainment channel) would be racist.  And just look at Obamas pastor Reverend Wright.  He stands up there yelling "GOD DAMN WHITE AMERICA" for this and that....now picture in your head a white preacher yelling "GOD DAMN BLACK AMERICA FOR THE CRIME RATES, FOR THE BLACK FATHERS WHO DON'T TAKE CARE OF THEIR KIDS, blah blah"  He'd be kicked out of the church, he'd be all over the news, and yup you guess it, branded "RACIST".

20090307024216AASQ7HT	Society & Culture;Languages	English native speakers please help?	I have written this text and I need help revising it. Can you please tell me what are the grammatical errors? Thank you very much.      Before beginning the actual process of writing a text, an author must first search sources and references concerning the subject matter he wishes to discuss. Even texts that try to bring some originality to their approach need a bibliography, because texts are always made from other texts. Otherwise they may not be considered well enough documented. Take for example a writer who prepares a work of fiction. It may not seem obvious why he needs to prepare in advance and study, but - unless he wants to write something like Flatland by Edwin Abbott - if he places his story in a certain city or region of the world, he has to know many things about its history, geography, cultural customs and use them as the background of his plot. If incongruities occurs, it will undoubtedly be pointed out by the critics, although they known they are dealing with a work of fiction. Every serious writer has to do some research in order to come up with something credible.   >    >         This point becomes clearer if we think of scientific books. Of course, no fiction is allowed, the criteria of fidelity to the truth is a lot stricter and thus the research work takes more time and is more thorough. It is evident that there is a lot less freedom of inserting one's own subjectivity in the text.

20090307030052AAKXxcs	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I treat him so bad. Now what do I say?	I am 17, bisexual but mostly heterosexual and I have been in love with my best friend for about 2 and a half years… (It’s sad lol). He was my best friend for 2 of those years and for the last 6 or so months, we haven’t been the best of friends but he always talks to me everyday.      I told him a long time ago I liked him and he accepted me and was still my best friend even though I was sure he liked me back but turns out he is the straightest of the straight. However, he doesn’t know I still like him.      Well anyway, I always get pissed off at him because he flirts with heaps of different girls, every girl talks to him all the time and he is always talking about girls because he is one of the most attractive and popular guys in my school. A few nights ago, all my anger built up and I started being a prick to him (I have done it heaps). That night I went to a party and he was there, I was the biggest prick to him that whole night saying insults and everything to him and at one stage pushed him into the wall and made him look like a fool to everyone else. I feel really bad but it was an uncontrollable rage probably because I am feeling over the top jealous and rejected.      Then that night when everyone had just jumped into random beds, my only option was to share a bed with him. After me being such a prick to him, he lets me hop in. That night after waking up after about an hour I realised he was all snuggled up against me. He was awake too just lying there which I could tell but I didn’t want to say anything so I just went back to sleep.      I didn’t talk to him in the morning; after we got up I went home straight away.

I am pregnant and applied for a new job, which I got and I did tell them that I was pregnant which was alright. A co-worker I have worked with for 4 year at my other job where I will still keep working answered the phone when my new employer called to get a reference from my Boss, not my co-worker. My co-worker then proceeded to ask my new employer if she knew I was pregnant because she apparently thought it was her place to make sure she knew. If I had not told my new employer this information her actions could have lost me the job, luckily I had told them. I have never done anything wrong to this co-worker, and have never done anything dishonest. I am shocked and hurt that she would do something like this to me, I have been a wonderful employee and she should have had only good things to say about me, even though she wasn't even the one giving the reference. I found out about the whole thing when my new employer said "I just called one of your references and the very first thing she said was do you know she is pregnant"       What can I say? The co-worker had no right to do this and I know she did it on purpose because that is the kind of person she is. She is quite a bit older than me but we have gotten along great ever since I started working there and I am just so hurt by the fact that she would try and make me not get a new job. How could someone you trust do something like this to you? I just don't know what to do, I'm so upset about it.

20090307051930AAEOuij	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Beginners Questions Regarding Buddhist Practice?	I have recently become interested in Buddhist practice.  I have started by reading "Buddhism: Plan and Simple" by Steve Hagan.        1.  Regarding the practice of always being aware of the present, how is it then that one is able to make plans for the future.  When you wake up in the morning, is it not living in the moment to make plans or expectations for what will happen during the day?      2.  The book states that in practicing Buddhism, one should follow only that which can be "seen" for oneself, rather than relying on "conception" of what we believe to be true.  What are come examples of this?  Does this mean that one should not believe in social sciences, for example?  And is Buddhist practice not, in itself, a conception?      Thank you!

20090307065240AAyC5nT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is the prodigal son in Luke 15.11-32 an anti-type of satan?	The sin of pride is the sin of sins- and the name of satan in Arabic is Eblis,pride. This sin possessed the younger son when he felt that he could become independent and sufficient in himself, and so asked for his share of his father's property. In spiritual language this means man's desire to become independent of God, to become a god to himself (Gen.3:5), and to lay out his life at his own will and pleasure. This is in great contrast to the prayer, "Give us this day our daily bread," which acknowedges a constant dependence on God.    After deciding to go away from home, a little while is spent in reflecting before actually setting out. This is the spiritual history of one who says that there is no God, and that he will set up an opinion for himself. His conduct is compared to that of men who forsake the fountain of living waters for broken cisterns that hold water (Jer.2:13).    The spiritual is among those who deny the existence of God means a want of truth, sincerity and love-the true nourishment of the soul.    He "joined himself to a citizen of that country" probably means that he tried to frame a new system of faith and belief in his apostate condition.  Nimrod did the same thing.   Such a fall, so low in guilt and misery, is an extreme case, but is possible to any soul after the first downward step.   This parable might very well have a new title, for it is really a Soul's Tragedy.   In the darkest hour of his troubles" he came to himself." His first thought was of his father, the fountain of spiritual truth and life.   There are many today that are searching for truth but the truth is right in front of them.    They use Mysticism and words like esoteric and say this is what we need a more understanding of truth.   The New Age Movement is one of these movements that like Adam and Eve want to be as Gods.   There is no way we could ever think or feel like or know His ways.   Our love is nothing compared to His love.People search for a better understanding of God's word when in truth "You must be born again" is the only truth. When you really become a child of God He will show you the truth. "The Truth will set you free"   Your thoughts

Anywhoo, anyone else watch it? and if so, what's your thoughts on it Bills' documentary on the various religions and belief systems?      Thanks in advance and Peace!

20090307065501AAbaWe7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fellow atheists: what is the passage(s) of the Bible that have better served your purposes?	All of those who have read and studied the Bible thoroughly and profoundly know that the Bible is more a tool for atheism than for Christianity. And that Christianity only read what's convenient to them and ignore the rest as symbolic literature, or simply skip it. Nevertheless, atheists read the whole goddamn thing and have a better knowledge of it. In spite, if you read the Bible from beginning to end, you're bound to become a non-believer. Now, fellow non-believers, what are those passages that have helped you better in a discussion/debate with believers? An example:      Mt. 10:34 “Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the   earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.   Mt. 10:35 For I have come to turn “`a man against his father, a daughter   against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-inlaw   —   Mt. 10:36 a man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’   [Micah 7:6]   Mt. 10:37 “Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not   worthy of me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more   than me is not worthy of me;

I have a friend that is married to a Muslim man from the Emirates and they seemed to be happily in love until his parents found out the girl was a non Muslim from the States. Now I'll just call her husband Abdul, Abdul's parents are very furious about this and threaten to take away his inheritance if he doesn't divorce her.

My friend is so desperate to save this marriage she is even thinking of going to Dubai and converting to Islam to make things better but his parents are very close minded and I don't even know if that will help, (I mean they really despise the girl) so please tell me what should I tell her?

Unfortunately, he is a little homophobic.       Last night, we were watching Desperate Housewives. And in that particular episode there was quite a few "gay" scenes; not kissing (always he will go "errr" in disgust) and when the gay couple was talking he said "God this is sickening to watch" they were talking about moving in, having kids, and getting married.       That really hurt me, as my Dad is not a bad person at all. And really I know he probably could accept me; just that now it appears that maybe that might not be correct!       What can I do? I am only 15; so I have no intention on telling him until after I graduate and have a job.       But after that - what do I do? Please only serious answers as I am quite worried!

I also put this q in Psychology but I wasn't sure if I would get that many responses there so I added it here.    Okay so here's the problem. I am not yet working at this store BUT yesterday was the 1st official meeting.Yesterday ( In yahoo answers ), I asked a question about a group of people but today after I pondered how the Manager helped me (supposedly) I am sitting wondering if I am going to be able to work w/ this woman.   So here' the deal. I had an issue w/ the owners of the store where I am going to work because they are from Pakistan( y'all helped me solve that thanks by the way :).I also had some smaller concerns that I needed to resolve and so asked the manager if I could have a word w/ her.      We went through the smaller concerns without a problem but when it came to talking about the owners,she told me " Well then you are working in the wrong Company" No joke , and she is supposed to be an ordained minister and this was her answer. That is why I asked the question here because I couldn't get her to help me through it.   BUT what really got me was as I was trying to talk to her about this she was slowly trying to leave the room as if the conversation was over. I really needed to get her to help me and I felt like she really didn't want to talk about it.   I am not too keen on female managers that act more like insensitive guys and who also look like a guy. I know that sounds really prejudice but she really seems more like a guy.   Her attitude and how she handled this really upset me and I am not sure I can work w/a woman that has the sensitivity of a rock at the bottom of the ocean. Am I being too harsh ? If you can imagine the situation , what would you do and could you work for a boos that was like this.   Please , be serious when answering and think your answers through. I have gone over it in my mind and really don't think I can work for this woman but anyone that has a good way to accept or handle this could change my view point.

So, as many of you know I had a bit of an uncomfortable situation with a very good friend of mine. I was starting to fall in love with her. Yes, her. And...after talking it over with my partner I decided to tell her. At first she was shocked and over time it turned out that she isn't too against the idea of being with me. she says she needs to slowly get to know me physically to want me in "that" way, but all in all, she isn't opposed to it, has thought about just kissing me on numerous occasions etc...      So, last night we had our fun little date thingy...and...slowly I got up the guts to kiss her. which I did, because she started singing the French national anthem off key and...it hurt. So, I told her that if she didn't stop singing, I'd kiss her just to shut her up. And she sang louder. And I did it.      And it was awesome.      She then remarked that she'd probably have to take the next step now, since I probably wouldn't again...and she kept rambling on about how she's scared to, to nervous...so i just kissed her again.      AND THEN, just when she was about to leave she pushed me against my desk and kissed me.      YAY! Soft, rose-water scented...way too short...       One question, though, she kisses with a lot more tongue action than I'm used to. It isn't really bad, I'm just wondering if I should keep going with my usual thing, or go along with hers? What does it mean whena  person moves towards french kissing right away? Because it seems more intimate than the normal kiss.

Constant worry about how we look. are we ever going to open our eyes and see that it doesnt matter how we dress or look. One of my favorite examples is braces, two years of your comfort JUST for straight teeth      3. Religion, just for its constant "we have the answer" attitude and "god loves you"      4. Corruption. like with money handling      5. War      6. Health. the constant watch for new causes of cancer. And what is with the beer and smoking ages, kids 13 and older can do both in different counrtries that are doing just fine.      7. Adults like Tipper Gore trying to ban music that is potentially harmful. just let us have our freedom of speech and be done with it      8. Religion in school. It needs to stay out and stop trying to get it back in.      so i hate the constant protective state that adults are in. There is nothing wrong with metal music (except King Diamond) There is nothing satanic about card games. there is nothing wrong with crooked teeth and religion is a cult, try protecting your kids from that and lead tham towards reason

20090307064431AAPRpWT	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do minority men prefer white women?	READ THE ENTIRE THING BEFORE YOU RESPOND!!!   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~... :)      Why is it that a majority of minority men prefer white women? Now, you may think this sounds ridiculous, but I guarantee it's true, and no, it isn't because there are more white people in the United States than Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino and Middle Eastern people. I think that "media brainwashing" can only go so far and as far as I'm concerned I think that's a copout excuse for people to only further perpetuate their own ignorance, close-mindedness and racism. So now I'm itching to know your thoughts on why so many minority men find white women more attractive than girls of other races. I think that if people stopped with this preconceived notion that women of other races are aesthetically unappealing and actually opened their mind to something other than fair maidens, they could change the way they think and view women and over time their idea of what beauty is and their standards for it would change.       Some men try to argue that white women come in more variety (i.e., blondes, redheads, brunettes), but couldn't the same be said about black women who can be a very light tan complexion with colored eyes, light brown wavy hair and freckles, caramel toned with medium brown hair, chocolate toned with black hair and very dark beauties with flawless velvety skin?      Some men try to argue that they like the facial features of white women (typically a straight nose, thin lips, etc.) but there are women of other races who also possess those facial features. Besides, not every white woman has a straight nose or thin lips.      So I honestly think men are just obsessed with the skin complexion of white women (paleness). I'm sure if all white women everywhere suddenly turned a chocolate brown hue, these men would quickly change their minds. But why should anyone think that light skin makes a woman "better"? It doesn't. It isn't more pure, it isn't more feminine, it isn't more ethereal, it isn't more anything. It's just skin, that quite frankly ages faster and shows blemishes more easily than other complexions.      Oh, and this ridiculous theory that they're "easier" to get along with - bullshit.      So, why do minority men prefer white women?

20090307052909AA9sdkT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is it okay for me to sever all ties with my brother?	I am 18, and for the last 11 years, my brother has been annoying me indirectly. He has an OCD whereby he has to "check" things every night. He turns lights on and off like 7 times in a row, counts things all around the house, and chants. This has gone on for the last 11 years, every night. The only times he hasn't done it are when he's been away, or at a friend's house etc...      It has annoyed me sooo much, you can't imagine. Like if I had exams the next morning, he still did it, and it has cost e a lot of frustration and loss of sleep. He is 22, and whenever he had exams I was always considerate. I still went okay in the exams, but that's besides the point. He has never made any attempt whatsoever to get help, despite me asking him several times. My parents have done nothing about it, they think it's just automatically going to stop.      I am not so naive, at least not anymore. I know it's not going to stop, because he refuses to get help.      I know I have to forgive him, as Jesus would, and if I expect jesus to forgive my sins, and let me through to God, I have to forgive him.      However, he has caused me so much anguish, that I am considering becoming estranged from him forever, in a few years time, when he or I gets married and moves out of home.

20090307072951AAVfBpo	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Social engineering for the future?	While I know all you conservatives will dump hate mail on me for this, don't you think we should explore the possibilities here?       My thoughts: America is a racist country still. And the recent election has only stirred their hatred against the minorities. Would it not be best that we socially engineer race out of the equation? If the government stepped in and offered tax incentives to have mixed race children and tax increases on couples who don't go along with the plan, we could in fifty years create a new race of one people. I think that multiple offenders who refuse to go along with the plan could be threatened with having their children removed and cared for by the state. If we used the super-computers at our disposal, we could match couples that are bi-racial and much less likely to be in divorce court down the road. Great possibilities here!

I also did a long and productive meditation that left me in great spirits. Sometime during the night I awoke with strange words flowing from my mouth and the memories of a dream fresh in my mind.    The dream: I was standing in a lavender/pink mist/light with tiny sprinkles of silver/white light falling down washing over me. I stood there with my hands over my head and drawing them close to my body as if becoming the light toward me.    Anyone have an interpretation of what this could mean???

20090307074804AA6JCub	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	A question for my friends on the "left" & for those who call themselves "feminists"?	I have a question which I am asking with respect and seriousness to   anyone out there who agrees with the political "left", including those who are "feminists".  I do NOT ask this question with the intention of   insulting or offending any person, so please, if you are not able to    accept an intelligent question, feel free not to participate.   I thank you in advance.      Question:  Why do those on the left, and essecially feminists, want   to cater and coddle Islam in America?  For example, leftist organizations like the ACLU will remain absolutely silent when an   Islamic group dresses up public school children and forces them to kneel on a mat and recite Islamic prayers, but you let some Christian   preacher come into the same school and even say the name "Jesus",   and the crap would hit the proverbial fan for sure.  In fact, the ACLU   is currently fighting public schools to assure that students are not even allowed to speak of God or Jesus AFTER SCHOOL OR ON THE   RECESS YARD, with the penalty of expulsion.      The "left" feels that they have a "mutual enemy" with Islam, meaning   the laws, policies and freedoms of the United States of America.   So, by joining forces, they both seem to feel they will be able to   move forward with a more "fair" system of Government.      Islam's Shar'ia Law follows the Qur'an verbatim:  Which one of these   statutes do those of you on the left and esspecially feminists, feel    will make your life and that of your family BETTER ?      1.( 2:282) Qur'an:   "Your women are a tilth for you to cultivate, so go to your tilth as you will".  (note: a "tilth" is a field, ya know, where you grow crops).      2. (2:282) Qur'an:   "Get two witnesses, out of your own men, and if there are not two men, then a man and two women, such as ye chooose, for witnesses, so that if one of them errs (one of the women) then the other can remind her".   (2 women are equal to 1 man; a woman witness is only worth 1/2 of      the witness of a man)      3. (4.3) Qur'an:   "If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, 2, 3, or 4, but if ye fear that ye shall not    be able to deal justly with them, then only one, or a captive that your right hand possesses, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice".   Note:  In present-day modern Islam, you can have multiple wives and   also you can buy women slaves to use as you desire.  This will help   the men keep themselves from raping at-will.  How nice.      4. (4:34) Qur'an:   "Men are in charge of women, because Alla hath made the one of them to excel the other, and, because they spend of their property for the support of women.  So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which allah hath guarded. As for those from whom you fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them".   Note: Scourge means "to beat".      HOW I WOULD LOVE TO SEE FEMINISTS LIVING UNDER THIS   RULE.  AND MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT: THE LEFT ACTUALLY   CATERS TO ISLAM.  Is it because they have no idea what the heck   they are getting themselves into?        Swat Valley, Peshawar, Pakistan:  This town has enjoyed equal rights and freedom of religion and speech, just like here in America, until   last month when they were turned over to the RELIGION OF PEACE,   SHARIA LAW.   This week, they are "celebrating" the 100th anniversary of the "International womens day", which was created to mark the struggle for equal rights of women.   So isn't Sharia Law even making life more wonderful for these women?      FEMINISTS, WHAT DO YOU THINK of these changes in Swat?      1. These "equal" women are now terrified, locked up at home and courting death if they exit the house without a male relative.      2. No freedom of speeh - not meaning they have to be "politically correct", it means COMPLETE AND ABSOLUTE SILENCE.   All you'll get is a sad and blank stare from any and all of them.      3. Not allowed to say their OWN NAMES.      4. Women who previously were working on degrees to become doctors, pharmacists, etc,  now have no right to go to school and no   books are allowed in any kind of home study or book study.   (you are "good" for one thing: being the field your man cultivates, remember?)      5. Even in their own homes, the taliban can enter and have their way   with all the females, regardless of the most tender of age.  If you report   a rape, you will be stoned to death.   (any of you want to hold up signs and complain?)      6. If a woman has an accident at home, or  heart attack or cannot   breath, she must die instead of being taken out of the house without   a male relative accompanying her.  No male relative? Then unfortunately you have to die,  sorry.     THIS GOES FOR THE CHILDREN AS WELL. THEY MUST DIE RATHER THAN BE TAKEN FOR EMERGENCY CARE.      7. No television, no more laughter, jokes or leisure time; no more celebrations, music, art, films, shopping for accessories or purses,   no more makeup, no barettes or hair ties.  The entire

20090307074756AA3IyP4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do many people think that Jesus's crucifixion = a free "sin-for-all"?	Ok, I was hoping somebody could shed some light on this for me and tell me why some Christians out there think that Jesus's crucifixion = a free "sin-for-all"?       Most recently, I've heard many televangelists like Joel Osteen, Billy Graham, as well as several fellow Christians say that Jesus's payment for our sins on the cross completely cancels out all our sins (past, present and future) and that as long as we believe in Jesus, we're automatically "saved" & ushered up into heaven. However, many Christian people out there seem to be interpreting this as saying "believe in Jesus, & sin all you want to/don't worry at all about sin, since the price for sin has already been payed". But that obviously can't be right. For if some believe in Jesus, yet also believe in a free "sin-for-all" DUE to Jesus's crucifixion, then they're obviously living a double standard and not truly following God's law, right? I mean, Christians can't just merely "believe" in Jesus, purposely sin all throughout their whole entire lives and then get "saved" at the last minute, can they? Or is there something I'm missing here? Is it more of a "well, humans aren't perfect, humans are gonna sin once in a while and it's nothing to get all in an excited 'hooplah' about since Jesus already payed the price for it" type of thing?        Yet, in a way, it's kind've similar somewhat to the viewpoint of some non-Christians out there (and notice I said some and not all) of: "well, if this so-called *Jesus* already died for my sins anyway, then why should I have to live a godly and/or humble life for him?" It seems like the gospel is WAY too watered down these days. Or is it just me?

20090307074642AAf8Y2d	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Can women accept a man wearing a bra?	Ok...I'm a 41 year old, heterosexual male.  i was born with Klinefelter Syndrome, which essentially means I got an extra X (female) chromosome at birth.  Men are XY, women are XX.  I'm XXY.   The only major way that this disease displays itself is in the clothes I choose to wear.  I wear womens foundation garments every day.  The fact is, I'm njust not comfortable unless I;'m wearing a bra, panties, girdle, stockings, etc.   I'd also like to add that I don't wear any of this for sexual reasons.  I wear it because it feels natural...Not because it's a turn-on!  The other part is, the KS has given me a slight case of gynocomastia, which is enlargement of the male breats.  I'm a natural B-Cup, so wearing a bra is probably almost a neccessity.   I'm just wondering how open minded a woman would have to be to accept this about a man.  Every other part of my life is completely normal.  you'd never expect this about me unless I told you.  I'm very discrete about what I wear.  Nobody has ever even noticed.  All of my family and friends know, and are accepting.  It's just near impossible to find a woman who's willing to accept it, in a relationship.

Every gay guy should own or have watched Beautiful Thing.      2. Bad hair days are not something that can be allowed to happen to a gay man. Lesbians are, of course, exempt and even encouraged to think otherwise.      3. It is a gay man's right to get invites to both the Hen and Stag nights.      4. When spreading rumours it is okay to exaggerate the truth, as long as it makes the rumour more interesting.      5. It is okay to be late; the heterosexuals just expect it from us. Don't make another homosexual wait too long though because it's a miracle that they are even ready on time.      6. When out, it is your legal duty to distract the ugly friend of some hottie with whom your best friend is trying to score. Should you get carried away with your good deed and end up having sex with the beast, your friend is forbidden to speak of it.      7. Similarly, you should always rescue a fellow homo from the clutches of any undesirable. Put your arm around him and act as their boyfriend.      8. When out, you are expected to sing along to every Britney, Christina, or Madonna song and to know every word.      9. Before dating a fellow homo's ex, you are required to ask his permission. If they say no you are allowed to date them anyway.      10. Straight men who say they're okay with gay people but don't try to hook up with them need to be watched closely because they can't be trusted.      11. If a homo's zipper is down, reach in and give his willy a shake.      12. When a homo asks you to help him move house laugh in their face.      13. Homosexuals don't fart in public, end of story.      14. A straight guy who is drunk is still considered off limits even if he is coming on to you like a two dollar whore.      15. Nevertheless, spooning drunk straight guys is not only acceptable, but strongly encouraged.      16. Only drink fruity chick drinks. Drinking beer is for hetero men and we're above that.      17. When fighting a fellow homo degrade them verbally till you can't anymore and then commence hitting like a girl.      18. Thou shall worship Karen Walker.      19. Honour thy *** hag.      20. Do not sleep with your *** hag's boyfriend. If and only if he makes the first move, making out and copping a quick feel are acceptable.      21. Never hesitate to reach for the last anything. We're gay and we deserve it.      22. When in the bathroom it's OK to sneak a peak at your neighbour's goodies, just don't get caught!      23. Do not take the name of Cher in vain.      24. Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his boyfriend, you must attempt to get a piece of the action or swear you'll tell his boyfriend.      25. The morning after you and a fellow homo who was formerly "just a friend" have drunken doggie sex, the fact that you're feeling weird and guilty is no reason not to do it again before the discussion about what a big mistake it was.      26. Don't hit on straight guys. This rule is null and void if the striaght guy in question is making homophobic remarks or just being a dick in general and needs to be put in his place. In this situation a light slap on the *** is acceptable.      27. Under no cirumstances shall a gay man ever shop at Primark.      28. It is perfectly acceptable to mock straight men for sleeping with women. The same is not true for lesbians as they are the bodyguards of the gay community.      29. You should aim to be fluent in one of the following subjects: fashion, dance music, show tunes, or interior decorating.      30. A significant period of time without gay sex may result in being downgraded to simply "amusing".      31. You may not call someone your boyfriend unless he is also aware of the fact that he is your boyfriend.      32. There is a statute of limitations on being "bi-sexual" of two years. After the statute has expired you must choose a team, or be randomly assigned one based on your hotness.      33. Being gay also makes you a diva. This entitles you to *****, whine, complain and just genrerally piss and moan about how things/people are not up to your standards.      34. Gay "seniority" is determined by length of time you have been out not by age.      35. The word fabulous is a word of gay creation.
