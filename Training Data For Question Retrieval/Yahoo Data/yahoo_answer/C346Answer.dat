fldXZ1BMaa	Being a Capricorn makes it harder as we really struggle with our self confidence at times, bu It's not about how you look, he obviously really likes you as a person and can see the beauty within which is how it should be.    I fell in love with someone who i didn't even fancy but i fell in love with him as a person and now i think he just sooooooo gorgeous when you love someone you except them as a whole person. Love isn't just loving the parts of a person you like, but choosing to love them overall.    Give him a chance and believe in yourself you otherwise you will always regret it.    I truly wish you the best of luck x|`|izL7WEzraa	good luck!!!!!!!

You are getting the music for free on YouTube which sounds good to you but not so good on the music sales for the Artists.  Think about it this way...you have a company that sells T-Shirts.  You sell them for $20 each and you're making decent money.  Someone comes along and gives the very same T-Shirts away for free so instead of your customers buying your T-Shirts they get them free from the people who are giving them away.    If people keep using and downloading free music off the internet where does that leave your favorite Artists, their Management and the Companies that produce their music?  With nothing for their work.  I completely understand why so many Artists are removing their work from the free sites.    Edit:  Music is a "product" and no different from T-Shirts.  If it was true that Artists wanted their music to just be played for the Art of it they would give free concerts and CDs to everyone.  Show me a popular artist that doesn't WANT to make money from their product and I'll show you an Artist that is living on the street.|`|48f16lTJaa	It's stupid!

AA11601079	I usually stay to the end of the movie as well, but I did walk out on one called "What Happened Was." It was back in the mid-1990s, and my school's film society was showing it. It won big at some film festival, but I couldn't figure out why. It was about two losers who have a dinner date at someone's apartment. Halfway through it, the girl next to me asked if I wanted to go somewhere. "Where?" "ANYWHERE ELSE!" "I'm with you!" And the whole row left.    There are some I've been tempted to walk out on, including "The Blair Witch Project" and "A Beautiful Mind." I can take boring or pretentious, but please don't throw both at me in the same film!|`|foWmh4Ohaa	Saaame! i totally agree with you! If it's really that bad then i just laugh at the actors and the whole film but damn it i paid so im staying til the end! :)|`|z1hZt12laa	oh yes. sometimes you just cant bear the movie and walk out in the middle. i moved out of theatre right after half an hour when i went to watch "the flintstones". couldnt bear it.|`|t45zTGZdaa	yeah ive done that a time or two. reason being the girl i was with was more interested in us making our own movie|`|7AfRkORxaa	I walked out of that movie The Holiday.

I have though turned off movies that I've rented or borrowed because I figure the financial loss in the situation is not as deep as the cost to my sanity.|`|AA11875616	"Keys to Tulsa" was the worst movie I've ever seen.

I don't do that anymore though, because if I do spend the money to see a movie I am gong to watch the whole thing, I wasted the money on it so my punishment for that is watching the whole movie, even if it does suck.|`|7RQDM1HGaa	We left during Balls of Fury and Don't Mess With the Zohan because they sucked horriblty|`|BLmfR6Ezaa	lol i usually stay till the end but i once walked out of The Exorcism Of Emily Rose - hahah i found it too scary|`|2pwIT6TXaa	Yep I'm the same way EXCEPT for one movie... that damn Speed Racer.

Leda2ha0aa	Well you are quite the Fabio fan!  I like Carla, not for her dishes, but her general personality and how she treats other.  Her facial expressions are quirky and she gives me a good laugh right before I go to bed.    I do also like Fabio.  I did not like him in the beginning of the show.  He and Stefan were acting like very cocky Europeans who thought all Americans were stupid.  Fabio has since changed.  I like the way he uses his accent to smooze the people in the restaurant during restaurant wars and he seems like a genuinely happy and likeable person.      I think it will be Stefan and Jamie to the end.  The way Jamie was give accolades by the last guest judge for the way she prepares her food, I think that was a clue that she will go far and the judges really think she's talented.  I just hope she doesn't do anything with scallops anymore!|`|3L9bRmOqaa	My favorite chef is Carla and Jeff (cries because he is gone) and Ariane. I'm rooting for Carls because unlike the others she is humble and does not make excuses when she is wrong. I can't stand team sluts (Hosea and Leah).|`|MBwdtRqDaa	Fabio is a sexy beast !  Plus it's in NY so yeah this is the best season...... totally agree. I think Stephan is a good cook but he's  too cocky, Hosea & the girl he flirts with are more into hanging with each other then concentrating on the show (plus I can't stand them for throwing their teamate under the bus, that was just wrong!). I'd say Fabio or the girl with the tats (sorry I can't remember names today! yikes) are deserving but the women with the big eyes has gotta go !|`|ciXSjbCiaa	Personality wise I like Carla and Jamie. And Leah as well - although she seems very very young.     I think the best chefs are Stephan and Jeff.     I don't like Hosea at all - I don't think he's that great, he seems to just hang in there.     Fabio really should have gone home last night! I think he has a great persona but seems to always be messing something up in a dish.|`|3TQCwtxJaa	Ariane was my favorite ;(    The only one I like that's left is Carla.|`|m5c1SPzOaa	My favorite is Carla, she's so funny, she might not end up being the "Top Chef" but I think she's good with desserts and she has an awesome personality. in the restaurants war I had my fingers cross because I don't want her to go home. I honestly don't know who's going to win.         On the other hand, my least favorite is Stefan. He can be a prick sometimes, but I know this show is about cooking and not personalities. Can't wait for the next Ep.

FK0Lc696aa	I agree. Funimation does a really good job with their dubs.   FMA is definitely one of my fave Dub anime, as well as Furuba, Beck, Black Lagoon, Coyote Ragtime show, Ergo Proxy, Full metal panic, Guyver, Le Chevalier D'eon, Moon Phase, Red Garden, Trinity Blood, and Wicthblade. Anything else from Funimation, I've either seen in Japanese, or not seen at all.     My all time fave anime dub is Inuyasha, though. I actually prefer the dub series, to the subbed one... and I rarely ever do that.     RahXephon and Gundam Seed are two others that are really good, dubbed. As well as Angelic Layer, Death Note (except for L), DN Angel, Guyver, Ghost in the shell, Gankutsuou, Elemental Gelade, etc....     Inuyasha, Gundam Seed and FMA are the only series that I prefer to be dubbed, though.     Some of the worst dubbed series I've ever watched are Green Green, Gravitation, Kaleido Star, Angel Sanctuary. There are a few others, but none of them are coming to mind at the moment.|`|yGfEUx8baa	i really like  cardcaptors in dubs and also Digimon,     i hate naruto dubs the voices are more irriating|`|rdVlcdQXaa	faves are:  inuyahsa  death note  wolfs rain  black cat    worst:  elfen lied  negima  shikan no shana (sp)  and soon to be vampire knight which is amazing in japanese (:

waDKbT61aa	I had a little mess around and recorded a riff you might like.    http://rapidshare.com/files/191111185/ri...    Enjoy.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Excellent work, Masterwing! It's a great sounding riff, I like it a lot!    I can't do that right now, but I can offer some general advice on how to write something that will work.    First off, it helps to identify the key signature - the key of the progression, and thus the notes we're using and what the tonality of the chords (major, minor, etc).    So let's count sharps. Since C and G are sharped, that means F is too, and since G is sharped D probably is too. So F, C, G, and D are all sharped - that's four sharps. We don't know if A is sharped or not, but we know E is not - so the key sig is either four sharps (E major / C  minor) or five sharps (B major / G  minor). Either way, the chord progression is    G m - B - E - C m    Let's talk notes. When constructing your riffs (both for guitar and bass) you're going to want to look at two different things - the chords and the overall tonality. What I mean is that you are going to want to include tones from the G m chord when you're playing over it, but you can also use notes from the overall tonality, in this case the safest notes to consider would be from the E major pentatonic ( E F  G  B C  E ) or B major pentatonic ( B C  D  F  G  B ). Neither of them uses an A, so we're safe using either one.    When playing basslines, you will want to emphasize chord tones, especially the root and fifth, on downbeats, and fill in other chord tones and scale tones to complement the sound. The simplest basslines are just playing roots, or playing roots and fifths. In other words, playing G  and D  under G m would be playing the root and fifth. It's important to note that this could be all you may ever need - but if you want something more complex, you're going to want to incorporate more chord tones and notes from the appropriate scale.    The same basic concept applies for guitar riffs - you can start with the chord tones, add scalar tones, and basically just mess around until you come up with something that sounds cool (kind of like how Masterwing did his riff).    So I can break down the notes you could start with for each chord, if you aren't up on your theory. The main chord tones are the root, third, and fifth, and i've added the pentatonics below as well.    G m   -  G  B D  (adding an F  here is okay)  B        -   B D  F  (adding an A here is okay)  E        -   E G  B  C m   -   C  E G     C  minor pentatonic - C  E F  G  B C     Since the G m is (presumably) the V of C m (ie the dominant) we can add a flatted seventh (b7) if we want to. We can also add a b7 to the B chord... since it moves by a fifth it helps the resolution along. Optional, both.    Off the top of my head a simple walking bassline could be    G m  --------- B -------------  G  B D  E   F  E D  B    E    -----------  C m ----------  C  D  E F   G  F  E C     I don't have my bass handy to jam it out, but it's a good place to start from. Walking basslines are fun, they have a sense of movement and can give a song a bit of a bounce. Perhaps not always appropriate for every genre, but relatively straightforward to write. The only chord I'm not sure about here is the E... the sixth isn't a very strong tone as far as establishing a chords identity, and it may be a little too ambiguous. As I said, you'd want to jam it out.    Good luck!    Saul

r5dK8PV6aa	My dogs only have to hear another dog on tv and sometimes just look at it to go crazy. Its like they have disturbed their peace. I have horses which my dogs hate and they hear the hoof beats on tv and its the same story. My dogs on rare occasions do not like the look of someones face or the sound of their voice and start again.  Looking behind the tv shows a smart inquisitive dog who is using his brain to figure out whats going on. Some are just lazy and dont care. So if you want to call that smartness then ok. But even if the dog figures out what is real and not wont stop it from lifting its head from time to time to just see if it was the real thing or not.|`|e43c70f0ddb74bd3e9e8e01784a9fa8faa	Not sure if I should answer this as I have a cat.

But whenever Carole Lombard was on the screen,  my dog would just go nuts.  It seemed he had a thing for blondes.
j9k3a0JBaa	I just had a listen, you are good, I think you know this aswel! :P But as with every proffesional singer your must have lessons, you have really good potential with your voice, I used to sing myself but stopped about 4 years ago when I left college, but I wish I carried on! I cant see any reason what so ever why you cant be a singer, if its your dream then follow it! Make sure you always work on your voice though no matter how good you are! Good luck!|`|8UyUhlusaa	I think you're ok, nothing special.|`|32oZL9uqaa	alittle but more pratice and youll be really good .. not to bad though ... but not perfect eaither|`|nKwcGLQraa	well, its kinda hard since you have another voice in the background. and you were kinda quiet. and off-tune sometimes.  try using less head voice.    otherwise, your pretty ok :).|`|AA11378460	If youre any good youll know. You wont have to ask anyones opinion.  Anyway your only 13 so just practise. Sing scales everyday and get yourself some ear training software.  Singing is not a gift its a skill that can be learnt by anyone. The worlds best singers usually have the same thing in common; they went to church as little kids and were exposed to good singing and without realising they were doing regular practise just by singing along in church.  Your a bit flat at times but the tone of your voice is good, just sing lots of scales every day for a minimum of 1 hour and then practise your songs.|`|uC9iiQqVaa	Honestly you need to do a song without words in the background because its hard to tell if its you or the song in parts.|`|abnN0c57aa	yeah, i think your good.  atleast your better than the original!  :)    xo
0b4636305e45b187a8f16d18854d3459aa	I think you are right. I tried to find the song also no luck.  I think you will have to e-mail the show or station..      * Have a Good Day *               ~ Don ~

Thank God the roads were clear. We had about 5" here in Wolcott, IN. There have been some slide offs this morning with the wind blowing the snow.    The funeral ceremony for Ingrid was real nice. Her brother decided because of her love of animals that she need them with her so he bought a stuffed horse, dog and cat to place in the casket. Five of her son's friends were driven up by the one boy's mom and dad and served as the pall bearers along with her mom's other grandson.    When I got home I decided to look at the answers. Glad I did. I forgot it was Happy Hump Day. I really got a kick out of the ones who provided the terriffic contributions to Happy Hump Day. They made me laugh (almost out loud).    It's great to be back even though I would have liked to be able to stay a few days more with Ingrid's Mom (Edith). She is ok most of the time when she has someone to talk to but crys a lot more when she is alone. Please pray for her and Ingrid's son (Scott) and her husband (Dan).    Glad Lincoln is gaining fast. If he keeps going it won't be too long before he will be able to go home. Isn't the magic   5 lbs?    Crazy H how far is your husband willing to travel to do work. I'm not sure what state you are in. If it were a little far from home we would put him up here while he does some work. We have 2 extra bedrooms.    bucsandducks sorry to hear about your grandmother. Like the others have said it was good you were able to be by her side when she went. She felt comfortable with you near.     Prayers for all.

XHdowuXlaa	I agree with the first post saying that the breakup with Brad Pitt had something to do with it.  Also she was considered the biggest breakout star when the show started, so i guess in general I would say she was better known outside of the show and not type typecast in the same way as Chandler or Phoebe.  She was known as Jennifer Aniston as opposed to just Rachel, so it's easier for her to be seen in different roles.|`|oyflZN2Jaa	I think Jennifer Aniston didn't wear a bra so all the young boys "noticed " her , then the Brad thing helped her rising star as it added his clout to her C.V.    That's all I can think of for why she is a "star"|`|w6MtjrMVaa	I seen the show a number of times and didn't think much of it. I think Jennifer Aniston was over rated, not only on the show but as far as looks, i didn't think she was that great. As far as making it big like i say she was over rated.|`|8OREBeRdaa	Jennifer Aniston milked the journalists for cover press because she was with Brad Pitt. I don't find her very talented at all...in fact I don't find many of those actors from Friends talented.  I never really cared for the show.  What carried the show was the well written episodes and dialogue.    I think Jennifer Aniston tends to play the same character all the time and she really has no range in her acting abilities.     I've seen Courtney Cox in a couple shows but nothing memorable (i.e. 3000 Miles to Graceland is just one)    Matt LeBlanc was in Lost in Space and I think that's it.  I thought he did a pretty decent job but got cut to ribbons by the critics.    Lisa Kudrow has been in a couple movies but again, not memorable.     I thought David Schwimmer was horrible until I saw his role in Band of Brothers.  I think he did a really good job.  Man, can that guy play annoying.  I also think he has some good voice talents for Madagascar - I think he should stick to voice acting and try and sound less whiny and nasal.    You could also ask the same question about Seinfeld (not that I watched that show either).|`|gOAbeQBCaa	because she was married to brad pitt and their break up was very public|`|Z10Oed2faa	david schwimmer did voices overs on madagascar  courtney cox did a few movies,i only know the longest yard and a few episodes of scrubs    if you watch friends none of them could really act well

39OVFs5Raa	Well I keep telling everyone the chicken crossed the road simply because he wanted to get to the other side!  However, heres what some really big names had to say...    Pat Buchanan:  To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.  --------------------------------------...  Louis Farrakhan:  The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed the "black man" in order to trample him and keep him down.  --------------------------------------...  Colonel Sanders:  I missed one?  --------------------------------------...  L.A. Police Department:  Give us five minutes with the chicken and we'll find out.  --------------------------------------...  Richard M. Nixon:  The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did not cross the road. I don't know any chickens. I have never known any chickens.  --------------------------------------...  Dr. Seuss:  Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes! The chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told!  --------------------------------------...  Ernest Hemingway:  To die. In the rain.  --------------------------------------...  Martin Luther King, Jr.:  I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.  --------------------------------------...  Grandpa:  In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.  --------------------------------------...  Aristotle:  It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.  --------------------------------------...  Karl Marx:  It was a historical inevitability.  --------------------------------------...  Saddam Hussein:  This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.  -------------------------------  Ronald Reagan:  What chicken?  --------------------------------------...  Captain James T. Kirk:  To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.  Fox Mulder:  You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens have to cross before you believe it?  --------------------------------------...  Machiavelli:  The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why? The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.  --------------------------------------...  Freud:  The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.  --------------------------------------...  Bill Gates:  I have just released Chicken Coop 98, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook and Explorer is an inextricable part of the operating system.  --------------------------------------...  Einstein:  Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the chicken?  --------------------------------------...  Bill Clinton:  I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. However, I did ask Vernon Jordan to find the chicken a job in New York.   --------------------------------------...    NOW YOU CAN TAKE YOUR PICK AND FINISH THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL!!!.|`|NsayGX3Aaa	to get to the other side      OR      her eggs rolled over there! lol|`|iKvPeRe8aa	the KFC chef was chasing him. lol|`|ec75e725937fc92000f2745410651420aa	Coz it can't fly...|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	i heard the chicken crossed the road, rolled in the mud then went back across the  road again he was a Dirty double crossing chicken|`|Esl2Ogi7aa	because he felt like it!|`|cix8nCpmaa	to get away from the farmer who was gonna kill him|`|8e93437ec97d7e2ea1dd51570704a365aa	Cos it wanted a pint of milk from co-op.|`|QSwJM33zaa	Isn't it obvious, he wanted to get to the other side. =p

XxSj6AsBaa	Mark:  Zip code is irrelevant, as you can fix this one easily on you own.  The most likely cause is that the jack is defective.  There is a jam nut on the outside of the jack.  Remove the nut.  Inside there should be two or three wires attached to the jack.  Unsolder them (note how they were attached).  Purchase a new jack from someplace like radio shack or order it from perhaps digi-key.  Install same way.  Play guitar.

VCIexeqyaa	Its funny because its so true. They always make social commentary thinking of every angle. I love that show.|`|FoxTcv4Zaa	i didnt think it was too funny. ive seen funnier south park episodes.  however, i did think it was kinda funny how the goths were being thought as vamps.|`|5xn2MIMUaa	that was a great episode :)    and others......http://southpark-zzone.blogspot.com|`|IhHmoRDQaa	I loved that episode, its one of my favorites. I'm into the whole Gothic culture too. I love vampires as well! Butters is my favorite character, I thought it was really good seeing him become a Vampire! :D|`|3HhyYXYFaa	I think it's a fantastic parody of the current vampire craze (Twilight, True Blood, Moonlight, Underworld, etc.) that's occurring in Hollywood.  Vampires apparently translate into big money.    I think they're throwing more darts at Twilight than anything else.  The "vampire" kids are detached from those around them and/or outcasts (like Butters) who see "vampirism" as some cool social club.  Their vampire status defines them and they have no personality otherwise.  They're followers, not self-thinkers.  Sounds like Bella to me.
GBKaftrJaa	I love the show.      Hurley is my favorite character. I feel so much sympathy for his mental illness and laugh hysterically at him.      My second favorite is Desmond for his ability to move about in time and his desire to help, like when he tried to stop Charlie from dying over and over again, and now how he's trying to find Daniel's mom to save the people on the island.    Third I like Richard for always being on the island and always being the same age.  And he's so calm and stable.|`|ryEiHFOnaa	I have never watched it..|`|GnsMHuSraa	Yeh, BIG fan!!  Kate is my fav. not just because she is HOT, but because of the way  she has developed since being on the island. She came to the island as a  criminal, but  has become one of the leaders, both  in helping people & involved in what's going on.|`|jMLBoMi4aa	I love it!! Charlie was my favourite before he dies. :(|`|AA11016425	I love Lost!  My fave is Sawyer coz he's so damn hot.|`|pQE5eZcqaa	I am lost in the programme tbh.    i gave up.|`|fQghpx3Zaa	I LOVE THIS SHOW! It's the best show ever and I'm completely obsessed.    My favorite is Locke. I adore him.  But I also like Ben, Sawyer, and Desmond. :)|`|zY3bNbD8aa	I Love!! Benjamin Lynus (sp?) he is overwhelmingly the best actor on tv whole show i get chills whever he comes onto the screen|`|n6oKAac1aa	I like Desmond because he has ties to both the island's past and its future.  He is a genuinely good guy who will sacrifice himself to save others(no pun intended)|`|cIPziIdnaa	No, I gave up on that show years ago.|`|AA10196640	I agree with Georegofthejungle. Kate is pretty amazing. But I loved Charlie before he died. And Hurley= awesome.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Charlie was till he died, now it's Sawyer.|`|AA11452399	Huge fan! Got the seasons on dvd, thus far. Love it, it is confusing, but it also exercises your brain. Believe me its an exercise to try and figure out what's going on. They definitely gave the show the right title for sure!

kzgmFekKaa	I'm hot and living in a tank top (or singlet, whatever guys are meant to call them). However I don't see it as that bad, maybe because I am blessed with an aircon, maybe because I'm ignorant. But my mate's not as lucky because she doesn't have good airconditioning in her house :)    But anyway even though it's hot in Adelaide, it doesn't feel as hot as it's been in the past, especially when I lived in Loxton in the Riverland.  But thanks for asking!|`|MI3r3jWeaa	OMFG I'm in Vic and at my house it was 43 IN THE SHADE 2DAY!!

Because he will do whatever it takes to help others over himself.    sorry i'm not really good in this kind of questions|`|9SWklMBBaa	Well, by fighting for something you care about will make you stronger. I just need to find something I care about to fight for.|`|Pq48dNPUaa	Well in pretty much every media form I've experienced, a man fights stronger when fighting for someone or some people worth while.|`|oG96QlHWaa	man who fights for others kinda both tho too    because if the man who fights for others is alone with another man fighting then he is fighting for himself anyway    a man who fights for others is a protector so that way say if someone is chasing you because of say you saw him steal something valuable or something and the guy saw you see it and came trying to kill you and  and  your boyfriends is with you and he tells you to hide and he fights the guy and stabs him and the guy stabs him or something and they get into a big fight and he gets stabbed but so the does guy who wants to kill you then he is fighting for you and protecting you!|`|XCBXIBiHaa	A person who fights is not strong because they can't settle differences with violence.|`|58ScqWG3aa	i think you first have to be able to fight for yourself before you can fight for others so yeah,fighting for yourself would make you stronger in the end i guess|`|XNIkS3KNaa	A man who fights for others is stronger.  They know they have to fight hard because it involves someone else other then themselves. :)|`|3N2ElzcQaa	A man who fights up to others because he's willing to fight for his own beliefs.
lFqm9XlUaa	Frequently asked questions about Frogs:  Q. Where do frogs live?  A. They live near lakes, ponds, and streams. This habitat helps keep their skin moist, which is necessary to their survival.    Q. What do frogs eat?  A. Frogs are carnivores. They eat other animals, typically bugs and worms.    Q. How do frogs hunt for food?  A. Except for an occasional blink, the hunting frog sits almost motionless. It waits for a meal to fly by, then snares it with a long, sticky tongue.    Q. How does a frog use its tongue?  A. When a fly or bug flits by, the frog hurls out its sticky tongue, snares the prey, and curls its tongue back in to swallow the meal. It's similar to casting out a fish line, then reeling in a fish.    Q. How is a frog's tongue different from most animal tongues?  A. It is attached in the front instead of the back, just the opposite of most tongues.    Q. Why do so many frogs come out onto roads when it rains?  A. Frogs need to keep their amphibian skin moist. They come out to move over land without drying out when it's rainy and wet. They come out on rainy days or nights to forage.    Q. Where do frogs go in winter?  A. Different species have different stategies for surviving winter. Northern leopard frogs, for example, pass the winter at the bottom of deeper lakes, far beneath the ice. They settle quietly on the lake bottom in deep water. They stay concealed behind a log or other debris to escape predators. Other types of frogs may hibernate under leaf litter.    Q. How do frogs survive the winter in cold places?  A. The frogs hibernate in burrows or bury themselves in mud. Toads and frogs are cold-blooded and their body processes slow down as the outside temperature drops. This is why you sometimes find frogs sunning themselves in the spring. Their body temp needs to rise for them to move well. Frogs' bodies have some natural antifreeze chemicals built into them, but a few kinds of frogs who live in especially cold climates can even survive being frozen solid.    Q. Do frogs migrate?  A. Frogs migrate when they go between their shallow summer breeding ponds and deeper lakes where they overwinter. Sometimes they have to cross busy roads to do this, which results in many frog deaths during spring and fall migrations.    Q. How do frogs time their migration from summer breeding swamps to winter lakes?  A. They move during rainy or high humidity days or evenings. Frogs stay out of the deep lakes until they are ready to hibernate, as hungry fish would gladly make a meal out of them. Frogs that arrive early hang out in the vegetation along the shore. Frogs that arrive later, when the weather is colder, swim way out to deep water, ready to begin hibernating.    Q. Do frogs hibernate?  A. We casually say they hibernate, but frogs actually estivate. That means to pass the time in a state of dormancy or torpor. Frogs estivate to escape unusually hot or dry weather as well as the freezing temperatures of winter.    Q. If frogs have to have wet skin, how do they survive during very hot or very dry spells?  A. During extensive periods of heat or drought, frogs can enter a period of dormancy similar to hibernation called estivation.    Q. Why do frogs sun themselves?  A. This behavior is called basking. When temperatures are cool, frogs need to bask in sunshine to warm up enough to be able to move. That's because they are cold-blooded, and their body temperature changes with the external temperature.    Q. What is a frog's role in the ecosystem?  A. They eat insects, small fish, and other small aquatic and terrestrial animals. In turn they provide food for fish, some large insects, snakes, lizards, larger frogs, birds, and small carnivorous and omnivorous mammals.Q. Where do frogs live?  A.

Certainly he must be talented enough to find suitable food and to feed himself. This is why the frog has an unusually long tongue. One of the favorite items on his menu is fly meat but flies as we know are not the easiest creatures to catch.    One end of the frog's long tongue is attached where his lower front teeth would be, if he had lower front teeth. Most of the time he keeps it coiled back inside his mouth and closes his mouth with a froggy smile. As he squats very quietly, he watches for insects flying by. When a fly comes within range, his long tongue whips out and grabs it. In less than a second, the fly is flicked into the frog's mouth and gulped down the hatch. And the remarkable tongue coils up and waits for the next snack to pass by.|`|RSbn5STjaa	Through the process of natural selection, evolution over time favored the tongue structure as the most efficient way for frogs to acquire food.

The version by Keely Smith is especially good.|`|c3BGCFdFaa	I like the idea of using the name of a song; which could be your theme tune.  Something like "Tuxedo Junction", "In the mood" or "Sentimental Journey" would be appropriate if you're playing the old standards.

XbGkjC4Taa	hey! my turtle's name is shelly lol.  anyway, i don't think your dog would have enjoyed eating the turtle.  it's shell is very protective, and it has rough skin.  shelly probably got out of the water tank, and dug her way to freedom underground.|`|QGuxbItCaa	Dogs will eat anything...even their own poo. Say good bye to Shelly.|`|CYhOr4s7aa	not a big one but a small one yeah  if he did the turtle is dead  ,  its around that house somewheres  probably  ,  a big turtle no you would see the mess it made|`|8EU3VREMaa	it is possible depending on the size of the turtle,|`|796970d9ecb68e3b85975b10a104a8ceaa	I've seen videos of much more powerful animals than dogs being unable to bite through a turtle's shell. So even if the dog actually got a hold of the turtle's soft tissue, it would be unable to consume the shell.|`|eY005pu8aa	Poor Shelly may be dog poo by now.

Truth be told, Shelly ran off with the cat.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	dogs eat everything get another turtle.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	i dont think the dog could bite thru the shell.  i kno dogs have powerful bites, but a turtles shell is probably equal to it|`|w1kvhxX5aa	turtles got good defense but no offense only way dog could eat it is if the dog some how weirdly dragged it out of its shell    ps if you dont see a chewed up shell some where then the turtle slowly roamed under your nose some place|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	I wouldn't think so. Wouldn't the turtle hide in his shell if your dog was any threat?|`|63dUOWFNaa	I think your dog mistake it with a bones.|`|0IhCFeXLaa	check the backyard or wherever your dog poops|`|lEjYhwxkaa	My dog buried my turtle under the house.|`|A15bfvkBaa	Your dog is really mean.|`|9eBruYtqaa	dogs eat their own poop, i'm sure a turtle would be tasty to them. poor shelly.|`|ahXIBlstaa	Maybe if your dog is big or aggressive.

One or none, I say... (dear God I sound like an old man!)|`|lEjYhwxkaa	yes|`|CPZA5qrGaa	That's a bad can of worms to open.  Get a new can.  Damn! I guess I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

There isn't much wiggle room on that one...|`|598OD7d6aa	Hmm that's a tough situation since if you get involved one of them will probably be pissed at you. What I would do is talk to your friend (or "mate" lol yay I'm learning new words from England) directly and tell them that its horrible that its happening and if your friend doesn't open up to your brother that you will|`|frwlypDWaa	Blood is thicker than water.

His blood pressure had been too high for the medication he took after being harassed at a local wal-mart, when the wal-mart greeter had flipped him off. Unbeknown to him, the wal-mart greeter had been upset at having swallowed a bug during her night time exotic dancing job. She had been working two jobs for the last two years to pay for a trip to south africa to swim with sharks, but unfortunately had been caught urinating outdoors by a cop and had to use all of her money to pay the public indecency fine she received.     so you see, in a way ive experienced them all.|`|haw8rJHGaa	Well lets see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 oh and 6 that would have some humor in it, i don't think pole dancing would work she'd have to be a really close friend lol.|`|rMmVuHEhaa	Donate my blood to whoever need it|`|AA10809514	1. give a stranger the CPR rescue technic - I lead the medical response team at work.    2. volunteer to work at a homeless shelter once a month - Does the soup kitchen count?    3. donate blood - It's actually healthy.    4. participate in a drug research study - Depends on what the drug is.    5. seek higher education - Academics can be fun.

e43c70f0ddb74bd3e9e8e01784a9fa8faa	I have watched it for years. My late mum got me into it.  The show is a wonderful example of stupidity and desperation. I'm afraid that these people are probably real.  Even now, I watch it sometimes and go to pick up the phone to laugh with my mum about the absurdity of it all. Shame, Jerry was a huge content in our phone calls.|`|xDDutHCnaa	I remember hearing my friend say a few months ago that the Jerry Springer show sued one of it's producers because she went on Oprah or something and said that everything is scripted and fake. I don't know how much of this is true, but you can look into it, I wouldn't doubt it.|`|fNWoRd2Haa	From what i've heard they are real people and real problems but they are encouraged by producers and such staff to exaggerate and go over the top. Rumours also say that they are also paid like $10 to take off clothes or pull off a wig or whatever.  But i guess jerry springer is one of those unsolved mysteries!|`|1QiPrFyfaa	i think that @ 1st the guests were real but the more recent ones are definitely fake!|`|a950da063e9c670dfa13b1fd89d288ddaa	They are real not actors.

If you watch the Trisha show the term is fairly self explanatory. No disrespect to the participants of Trisha`s show but they do set themselves up so others can have a laugh, and their stories are well sometimes so awful......  As to whether Springer and producers hires actors, dunno but wouldn`t be suprised.

Joe's said he likes Australian accents, so maybe he'll like an Australian girl.    IDK.|`|MXpW48lFaa	Well I don't think all of them will.  It's most likely Joe will marry a celebrity.  As for the different country,  who knows, it could happen  and as for age, I think it's more likely older.    Joe saying posh is the ideal body type for a girl,  well it wouldn't surprise me,  he could of ment it,  and could of just said it.    Hope I Helped :)|`|bOPCnScpaa	they may marry someone who is non famous, but i don't know  and i don't think Joe meant what he said  well i hope not|`|Qzn1cungaa	i know they would date a fan so you have a chance......but a small chance.|`|iPVaHiQRaa	i really hope that  because i am not from USA or England and i am not 19 years old like him|`|sPOmz9wUaa	Umm..Maybe they might go out with someone, but in teh end the Joe bros will end up maryign other celebreties unless their ver ydown to earth. Plus, i think some of them are gay.|`|sZIKrMX0aa	they said in their live chats about dating a fan  they said they definately would, and that theyve dated fans in the past.  age is only a number, if they liked someone i doubt they would care if they were a couple of years apart,  i reckon theyd date someone from a different country, theyd have to do that with anyone because of how often they move around, touring and such.  'she wont break my heart, cause i know shell be from australia, she is so beautiful, shes my dream girl...'  they obviously have no problems with different countries  and i have no idea about that joe/posh thing.  i do know he likes natalie portman and jessica alba though.

tuATxHsVaa	Both are hard to master. Mastering an instrument is hard, period.    How hard is it to play "Mary Had a Little Lamb" on harp vs. piano? Well it's pretty easy on both if you do the simplest version.    Both instruments will challenge you in one way or another, I guarantee it. It's all about your preferences. Since you play piano, I think you will understand the basics of harp playing pretty quickly. It's basically a giant scale of strings and you shift the scale with different foot pedals. A piano has a harp in it, so you are playing a harp on both instruments. The piano has strings for every note, a harp player's harp usually does not - but I am no expert.    Violin is a very challenging instrument. If you have never played then it will take you 6-10 years of dedication to become a professional. That is my guesstimate. And no, you can't learn it on your own. You must find a teacher. Don't buy a violin without getting help from a teacher first.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	The video link doesn't work for me, so it's impossible to tell if you are talking about a folk harp or a concert harp. Though I've never tried it, playing a folk harp (leaver harp) could be child's play, there are dozens of performers at the Celtic festival I attend annually typically playing basic melodies and arpeggio patterns to back other instruments of voices.    Concert harps, (pedal harps) on the other hand, are an entirely different animal. I've seen some phenomenal players who make it look effortless, I believe they would have had an easier time studying brain surgery.|`|1HLPznZhaa	I too play the piano. I love the sounds of the Harp but will have to say I think the Harp would be more difficult to learn .. Go to a good music store and ask for a teacher who teaches the Harp..Go for it ..What have you got to lose...To master the violin ? unless you have a natural talent you are looking at a long term experience.. Andre' Rieu is my favorite with his Stradivarius .. Also Itzhak Perlman with his Stradivarius .. Two of the greatest violinist in my opinion of this century..|`|R1fz9aIUaa	I have a friend who has been playing piano for seven years and harp for about four years. She says that harp is easy to play because it is just like the piano. Knowing that you've probably mastered the piano, harp should be a breeze.     And about the violin, I've been playing for about seven years now. I'm not sure what you were hoping to play, but I am playing songs in the fifth Suzuki book at the moment.     Also, if you're interested, I put a link to my band Copywright playing Stairway to Heaven in the 'Sources' box. I am the violinist on the far right (solo part at the end), and the friend I mentioned is on the piano.
538ceb4acaef4ac2ccf484f71831be0caa	Yes, I just finished watching my recording of it. It seems pretty good, but I'm wondering how on earth they can come up with fresh story lines every week -- such a narrow focus. But then it works for House, doesn't it?

swL7bQfAaa	Have not seen the film, but have read Shakespeare -  The title "Seven Pounds" refers to the Shakespearean pound-of-flesh metaphor, meaning a figurative debt that needs to be paid back. Smith plays Ben Thomas, a man who feels the need to do good things in order to compensate for a tragic past event.    and following this thread I guess this anomoly occurs in the movie - a man with a big heart?  "You people are all wrong!!! 7 pounds is the weight of an adult human heart! Didn't you watch the movie? How could you not figure that out? I figured that out as soon as Rosario Dawson needed a heart transplant!! The whole point of the film was for Will Smith to give his heart away. That is why he contacted her in the first place!! That is what the Jelly fish and the hotel room was for. Even his friend (Barry Pepper) knew he was gonna kill himself. Remember the scene where he yelled at Barry? Yeah he killed 7 people, and he wanted to help 7 people, but the title "7 pounds" had nothing to do with that. Wow."|`|XuDqmgGTaa	That the the budget for the movie.|`|GBuJNF2Qaa	Watch the movie and the answer will become rather obvious. The answer is a spoiler.      Edit:  Fine, since this seems to be asked daily...    Check out http://www.save7lives.org/. The title simply refers to organ donorship. There are 7 organs commonly transplanted from organ donors. 7 organs - 7 pounds. There's nothing more to the title than that.|`|qeYdErVtaa	Its to do with 7 chracters and the weight of a human heart or brain weighs 7punds|`|sALPielpaa	Well, the person that acted like they knew the human heart weighed seven pounds and we're all idiots is not so genius. The human heart only weighs about 9-11oz. on average. I think the Seven Pounds title is for everything he gave up at the end of the movie, not just the heart.|`|wKJZG9K2aa	Now that's a really great question.|`|5Ra5xbziaa	i don't even know|`|75107d92736ad6fea72a78e30303fbdaaa	don't know, but the film looks very good!

C4knGt7Iaa	Good point but no, they are NOT related.  Here's how:    Grandpa Shawn who RAISED Bo but was not his biological father (Victor Kiriakis had an affair with Caroline) was Colleen Brady's younger brother.  They also have a brother named Eric, who later molested Bo's sister, Kimberly.  At any rate, yes, Colleen is John's mother.  That makes Belle and the twins, Sami & Eric, cousins as well as half-siblings.  But because Bo's father is Victor Kiriakis, that makes Shawn a Kiriakis but raised a Brady.  No one knew that Victor was Bo's father until he' was an adult.  Being a police officer brought a lot of tension between them.  He had a gun to Victor's head swearing that he was going to pull the trigger.  That's when Caroline chose to blurt out "he's your father!!!"

lASDuMWqaa	It is what Motown records were called when released outside the US, and the reason is the label was originally called Tamla - see quote from wikipedia -     Tamla Records: Established 1959; Tamla was a primary subsidiary for mainstream R&B/soul music. Tamla is actually the company's original label; Gordy incorporated Tamla Records several months before establishing the Motown Record Corporation. The label's numbering system was combined with those of Motown and Gordy in 1982, and the label was merged with Motown in 1988. Notable Tamla artists included Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and The Marvelettes. Tamla Records slogan: "The Sound that makes the world go 'round."|`|OD3FqMaKaa	http://oldies.about.com/od/soulmotown/p/...

AA11601079	That does happen to me sometimes. This is especially the case when the actors are speaking British or Australian English or have an accent (say, Penelope Cruz). When it does happen, I just put on the closed captioning. After all, that's one of the reasons why it's there, right?|`|8OREBeRdaa	Yep, I do.  Especially war movies or movies set in other countries.

MNRRpYgLaa	Yup, usually. They sometimes talk so fast I cant catch the words. That's why I like watching movies with english subtitles.|`|yRZuoyPXaa	In movie theaters or DVDs?

VclnZhSCaa	A lot of the stuff Swizz did for DMX, and other Ruff Ryder members didn't rely on samples. If it was sampled, the consumer didn't know it.    "Stop Being Greedy" for instance, samples a Diana Ross song.    Also, Kanye West's "Flashing Lights" didn't contain a sample. A lot of times, people confuse vocals, with sampling.|`|y4IJcDLGaa	Sabotage - Beastie Boys|`|wfZhkZO0aa	I can't think of any off the top, but I know there have been you just caught me on a bad day.  I'll get back to you on that one.|`|DDmFQU7raa	What's up Tamb?    Good question. Only one that pops to my mind is "I Need Love" by LL Cool J. Not exactly a commercial hit, but it's somewhat well-known among the masses.|`|bribxhsdaa	I think a lot of hits that use samples prey on the idea of the listeners familiarity with the sample.    People who had heard "Superfreak" recognised and instantly liked "Can't Touch This".    I don't know too much of any modern commercial examples though....Feel free to give me some.|`|khU8m4gxaa	Do It Again by Jay-Z. It's almost 10 years old & they still play that now sometimes in the club. The hook is vaguely similar to a old DC go-go song, but there's no sample.|`|q4XUy0Duaa	That's a good question.  I can't really think of any, because most producers sample even if it's from some obscure song that no ones ever heard.  I guess the Roots, since they actually play instruments, might be one of the only groups who hasn't sampled all of their stuff.
AA12315431	He is a plant. This season is full of them just like last season. AI is supposed to be about finding "undiscovered talent." Being the nephew of Donny and Marie, you know darn well he isn't undiscovered. As for the rules of the show, you can't have a current contract with another music company. other than that, you can be on it.|`|gnCiGSjbaa	Well, other people that have "made it to Hollywood" and further have already had albums out. Even if he doesn't win in the end, I'm sure some company will sign him to a contract.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	I was curious about that, too, remember Joanna Pacitti (sp?)  She had a contract and was dropped, and she auditioned for AI, but apparently, it's all good and within the rules. I think it has something to do with currently being signed to a recording contract, not past. They are free agents, so to speak, and are free to audition for AI.     I love the Osmonds! I was wondering even why he tried out for AI to begin with, I mean, he's a freaking OSMOND, aren't they born with recording contracts? (lol)    I'm not hating, either.  Have a great day!|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I didn't think he had sung professionally before.|`|a950da063e9c670dfa13b1fd89d288ddaa	I don't think he has ever made a record. I also think he has too much pride to ask his Uncle Donny for a record deal.   I don't think he will make it ether his voice is more broadway then pop singer.|`|AA12390047	I like David O too, but don't know that he's ever sung professionally - has he? or just his dad has.  I don't think he'll go all the way, but it's really too premature to say.  I think a couple of the girls have been better than David.  I can't wait to see tonights show.  Oh.  There's another girl at the auditions last week I think who had a CD out and it went no where, and now she's back trying to win Idol.  Remember her?
dZ1efw1Paa	Yeah I'm a scorpio too and my dream made like no sense last night either lol.  Hmm...   To hear a bell in your dream, represents a warning or a call to order. The ringing of the bell could signal the beginning of something new or a way for your unconscious to prepare you for whatever is happening next. If the bell rings and never stops, then it suggests that you are experiencing extreme anxiety.    ^^hope that helped.|`|BNPywlwnaa	UR HORROR SCOPE WAS REALLY SCARY

7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	I have spider issues...I keep them out mostly...kill them if I have to and say a prayer for them (not sure how much weight a devout agnostic's prayer holds, but I try)...and let them be if I possibly can.|`|12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	I live in the country, and  I am bound to have a few spiders in places such as under the stove or behind the refrigerator. I'm really a clean freak, so when they do come in, they don't last for long. Occasionally, I'll find a little one in the bathroom, or in a corner.    Yes, I kill them. I know they are beneficial, but I am an arachnophobe who is unable to overcome this fear.    Now, if they are on the porch or in my garage, they are allowed to live. I will sweep down their webs, and I do perform "abortions" by destroying their eggs. There is a difference between allowing a few to remain and becoming overrun.    When it comes to big spiders, all bets are off. I don't hesitate to kill them. It's that look of maniacal glee on their faces as they run across the carpet. Such murders are normally performed with a lot of screaming and drama on my part.|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	They don't bother me at all so I don't bother them.|`|CX2pfYqdaa	I kill the mothers. Cant stand the webs and mess they make.|`|Lj2mo4ooaa	My friend has tarantulas as pets.  Only 3 right now.  He doesn't let them run loose or anything.  He keeps them in his bedroom.|`|CZIQMIr0aa	I think there is one at the moment because it was only a little one and I couldn't be bothered to kill it the other day! I am okay with killing them though.. well actually, I sometimes have to get other people to do it for me - not because I feel bad but because I'm too damn scared to even go near it with a hoover!!!|`|4SGBr8cWaa	i give them to the cats|`|MzZ1xenkaa	no and no but if they big they gotta go lol|`|PSk0zY5uaa	thers one here and there... mostly daddy long legs tho, so i dont bother them|`|2XTkSV4daa	killkillkillkill all the bugs...ants, mosquitoes, and spiders. I don't go near cockroaches..those get shoved out the door with a broom.|`|A15bfvkBaa	Yea i have many spiders.. probably tiny ones  I would kill them if i found them walking on me.. but if they are away i'm too lazy to kill them|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	They're a non-chemical form of insect control and far less annoying than flies. I'm quite willing to overlook a web or two in exchange for the service they provide.|`|Dl1J1Y9Haa	no  and no, save the spiders|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	There's a couple little ones that I've left alone because they've never crawled anyplace that's really invading my space, but I generally don't have an issue with killing them (actually, a lot of times I simply take them outside, regardless of weather).  My home is my territory.  They are invaders.  When I am in the woods, the only insects I kill are the ones crawling on me, and often I just brush them off.  But in my home, I'm in charge.|`|viyWk5BIaa	I like Daddo (daddy long legs)     He lives in my corner. He's my pet.|`|AA11523465	I'm in the country, and I've seen spiders in the house.

I know there's probably loads of them but I can't stand them so I pretend that unless I've seen them, there aren't any there. lol. If one does decide to visit, I freak out and scream and get someone to kill it for me, or get my kitten to eat it. Eughhhh I hate spiders they're so gross and scary!!|`|ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	I do have spiders living in my house in a few corners and under one table. NO, I wouldn't kill them at all. they went to all the trouble to attempt to survive the winter by hiding from the cold in my home. they do a service for me during the summer by eating all the mosquitoes and other pests around the house. So I show them MY gratitude and appreciation for the job that they do by allowing them to live unmolested in my home over the winter. As long as they stay where they are at and don't bother me, they are perfectly safe.    Brightest Blessings,  Raji the green Witch|`|lwhzvlSMaa	Not knowingly but I am sure there are some in the house.  I am very ok with killing them when I see them in the house.  They can live outside without any worry from me.

I am extremely blessed and grateful for that :)|`|CfWXgwxBaa	I `ve been in 2 violent relashionships,and in both I was the violent one.  I never got caught for it,because it`s still a real taboo for a man to cry on other people`s shoulders for domestic violence comitted by a woman.  . I am not proud of what I did, but I presume that whenever I am in a serious relationship I release the  rage that I  repressed for years ever since I was a child.  Because you see,my own father was abusive,to such an extent that we ended up running for our lives becuse he was about to kill us.And since I was little ,I use to hate everyone of the opposite sex.My mother was ,unfortunately very submissive and I swore to myself that I would NEVER EVER be like her.I also knew that I`d not be  fit to be in any relationship until I manage to get rid of my demons.My 2 previous relationship have only confirm that .  In both cases,the guys I was dating seemed to be very submissive and in love with me,which made things even worse.The slightest disagreement or whenever I don`t get my way,would be sufficient to have me going berserk.  In both cases,I did the breaking up before I`d eventually end up doing something irreversible.  Now,I am alone again and it`s better this way for me and everyone else .I`ve been told how attractive I am by most people who come near me and I decided recently to keep a low profile appearance-wise,so that nobody would be tempted to ask me out.Because when it  does happen,and that I find the guy equally attractive,I get myself into the illusion that thing would be different,when it clearly will not,because of  all the issues and past ghosts I haven`t yet dealt with.|`|gIitANOkaa	Victim...|`|jkXYlKJzaa	no ive never hit a women and would never and i also have never been hit

NQ37mnWkaa	Now, it would be all too easy to include song sequels that have been put on the same album, so I won't {so no 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond!}.       Songs :~  Stevie Nicks : 'Enchanted' {1983} / 'Destiny' {1994}  Blackmore's Night : 'Possum's Last Dance' {1997} / 'Possum Goes to Prague' {1999}    This one is more of a re-visit :  In 1975, Rainbow covered 'Still I'm Sad' as an instrumental. In 1995, they covered it again, but with the lyrics http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4msmMBkl...      Ah... and speaking of Mike :~  "Tubular Bells"  "Tubular Bells II"  "Tubular Bells III"    There is also 1975's "The Orchestral Tubular Bells"   But Mike didn't much like this one, as it was someone else's interpretation of his work, with him on guitar        ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~   This is totally unconnected, but I just had to share it:   I am listening to a radio play, and they announced at the beginning "Warning, this play contains scenes of a sexual nature... and the music of James Blunt"|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	Harry Chapin's song "Taxi" spawned a sequel, appropriately titled "Sequel."  It was on the last album released in Chapin's lifetime.    The most famous one would be Meat Loaf's "Bat Out of Hell" and its two sequels.    Frank Zappa also had a three-part "Joe's Garage" series of albums in the late 70s.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	I can think of another great Album that has three great sequels..

Abigail II - King Diamond  Operation: Mindcrime II - Queensryche    Though, first thing I thought of when I read your question is the one "sequel song" for which the "part 1" is almost totally forgotten:  "Rock and Roll, Part 2" - Gary Glitter|`|7fEVNng5aa	King Crimson- Larks' Tongues in Aspic, pts 1-4  pts 1&2 on the album Larks' Tongues in Aspic (1973)  pt 3 on Three of a Perfect Pair (1984)  pt 4 on The ConstruKction of Light (2000)|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Phish: Tube parts 1&2, Tower Jam (IT) parts 1&2, Axilla and Axilla part 2, Glide & Glide 2, Tweezer & Tweezer reprise|`|k4GqiB6taa	Of course,i'll name a few by Rush.

I also think that Dream Theater continued a thought, not necessarily a theme or a concept, from the end of their 'Scenes from a Memory' album to the beginning of their next album, 'Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence'.    They end and begin, respectively, with the same white noise.    EDIT : Dream Theater has Metropolis parts 1 and 2, where part one is a song, and part 2 is an entire album.    EDIT  2 : Liz Phair's 'Exile in Guyville' is a song-for-song response to the Rolling Stones' 'Exile on Main Street' album.   Not *exactly* what you're referring to, but in line with it, I think.|`|1ViGcF3xaa	The Beatles song Revolution and Revolution 1.  Revolution 1 was recorded first but released on The Beatles album 3 months after the one released on the other side of the single Hey Jude, which was a slower version.  You could also maybe say that Revolution 9 was a sequel too because it had some of the parts of the original in that version.    Rush has "Cygnus X-1" from the Farewell to Kings album and the sequel on the Hemispheres album called "Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres" but I'm sure you know that!

p3axDezYaa	no haven't heard this..     Now I will do some research because what I heard is that the foursome is supposed to fall for one another and who falls for whom will be a surprise..     If Lilly does get pregnant by Billy and then finds out about Chloe then she will be heart broken and prob go running back to Cane! Now you all remember that she was adamant about Cane marrying Chloe because he "got her pregnant". Now what will she do?? Will uphold what she was pushing Cane to do or will she be a hypocrite??     I personally thought the story-line was out of date and stupid for them to make Cane marry Chole because no one does that in these day and times..     But we shall see what happens because Billy is actually in love with Chloe and we all see this on his face.. So he will choose Chole and Cane will go running back to Lilly and Lilly will find out she is pregnant and prob trick Cane into thinking he is the father..     Those are a couple of ways it could happen.. Who knows what the writers will do b.c. they are always changing character profiles..|`|BwHoLEHvaa	OMG!  Thank you!

If she is pregnant I want Cane to be her baby father .Double Cross's hope tha happen . And Billy+Chloe 2ghter prefect match.

The sad thing is, I'm not even sure any of them (with the possible execption of Victoria) will even have any remorse once Brad is gone.|`|AA11608168	I was wondering the same, but i agree with Bex.

ad435fff04a01ee033f5addcbcdcbf65aa	Track for track, Clumsy was my favourite album of theirs.  The guitar riff on Carnival is one of the eeriest/cheeriest things I have ever heard (very hard to achieve), the music video for Automatic Flowers was well done with subtle special affects and 4 a.m. has some of the best lyrical content ever written.  When I first heard the lead chord progression on Superman's Dead I knew this album was going to be a doozy.  <br>  <br>  With the release of this album, I believe that OLP made their statement that they make serious music.|`|0c9bc0a72c761988a1c76279715bbdd3aa	Clumsy is one of the best albums of all times. I, for some weird reason,can relate to every song on that album mainly 4 am(one of my life theme songs)and automatic flowers(makes me think about my mom) .

uGFzzLYWaa	I'm of Swedish heritage, so I didn't think it was that bad. I got to see footage of my motherland, so to speak, which only made me want to go visit Sweden, but paranormally, yes, it was lame.   I still like it better than regular GH. I am so tired of seeing Grant and Jason doing their "Roto-Rooter" thing in the beginning of the show, ("Jason, hand me a wrench, we have to fix this toilet" )with the "interrupted" phone call alerting the blue collar dudes to a paranormal activity infestation. So rehearsed, so pointless. Ugh.|`|50413e6060a85c241ba6435845a4cc2aaa	Thats what I like about the Ghost Hunters franchise though. They arent ALL about entertainment value like Paranormal State. Its real ghost hunting and a lot of the time, yeah...it can seem boring. You dont find much, nothing happens, you're bored, you're cold, you're tired, you're hungry. Maybe it was the best episode they could make of the hunt they experienced. That being said, if the episode was boring, then feel sorry for the cast and crew who had to go through the real thing.|`|AA11452399	Yea, I'm a fan of the GHI too and I agree last nights episode was a bit boring.

Fields' "It's a Gift".   I also love the scene in "Min and Bill" starring Marie Dressler and Walter Beery, where Min tears the room to pieces in her attempt to absolutely crucify the duplicitous Bill.   "the Blues Brothers" almost invariably satisfies me with humor coupled with a formidable cast of acting and musical talent. I also like "48 Hours" for its non-PC crassness and irreverence.   I do love "Clerks". Randall is the anti-man ****** of my dreams.

It might surprise you.
waDKbT61aa	Sending demos to record companies is not a very good way of getting known. You'll end up in a huge pile of CDs on an A&R person's desk and it's very hard to stand out in those circumstances - however good your music is.    If you have a massive following, the industry will come to find out what all the fuss is about. Spend time making your music and live shows amazing rather than mucking about with demos.    Promote yourself properly. Make sure that everyone who's likely to come to a gig knows where and when you're playing, every time you play. Use mailing lists, email lists, local press, fliers and posters to promote your gigs.    A&R people don't turn up at gigs randomly, so there aren't really any places to play to be 'spotted'. Also you don't have to play London to get your name known. A&R people have contacts all over the country. If you're causing a stir, they will find out.    Don't just concentrate on record labels. There are lots of people like PR companies, lawyers, publishers and producers looking for new business. These people get a lot fewer, demos so yours will be in a much smaller pile.    Be patient - it normally take artists a couple of years at least to get to the stage where they're ready to sign. Spend some time learning to work as a group and developing your songs and performance before you divert time into trying to get signed.    Don't be too eager. The more desperate you are to get signed the more likely you are to sign a contract that's not right for you. Take your time and consider each offer carefully. Don't take something just because you haven't got anything else.    With underground styles like dance and hip-hop, labels look for tunes that are happening in the clubs. Consequently, you're better off ignoring the labels and getting your tunes straight to DJs.    A demo addressed to someone by name is much more likely to be opened quickly. Find the right labels by checking the sleeves of records you like. Call and get the name of the person who handles your kind of music.    Phone the person before you send any material. Then leave at least 10 days after sending the demo before you call again and see if they've got it. Give them some time to listen to your music and don't hassle them.    A&R people tend to hang on to promising demos and see what else is sent, so try and keep a steady flow of demos coming. A new recording every few months will keep your name up and show that you're still active on the scene.    Once you start sending out demos, make sure you keep your website up to date. If people like your demo, it's the first place they'll go to see what you're up to and maybe check when you're gigging.    Everyone at every level gets knocked back several times on the way to the top. Don't take this personally and don't be disheartened. One person's negative opinion doesn't mean that much. Keep at it!

40kCOPicaa	In June 2002, director Steven Spielberg told Starlog magazine that he planned to produce Jurassic Park IV and that director Joe Johnston, who helmed Jurassic Park III, would direct it. In November 2002, screenwriter William Monahan was hired to write, with the film's release slated for summer 2005. In July 2003, Monahan completed the first draft, with the story no longer set in the jungle. Actor Sam Neill said he was returning as Dr. Alan Grant, with filming expected to begin in 2004 in California and Hawaii. In September 2004, screenwriter John Sayles was re-writing the script, with the film re-slated for a winter 2005 release. His second draft focused on the new character Nick Harris, who returns to Isla Nublar, the location of the first film, and retrieves Dennis Nedry's can of frozen embryos. He is captured by the Grendel corporation, which now owns InGen, and he is hired to train five genetically modified Deinonychus as mercenaries.    In October 2004, paeleontologist Jack Horner said he would return as technical adviser for the fourth film as he had done for previous Jurassic Park films. By April 2005, special effects artist Stan Winston explained that the delay in production was due to repeated revisions of the film's script, none of which satisfied Spielberg. According to Winston, "He felt neither of [the drafts] balanced the science and adventure elements effectively. It's a tough compromise to reach, as too much science will make the movie too talky, but too much adventure will make it seem hollow." In February 2006, producer Frank Marshall said filming would begin in 2007 for a 2008 release. In March 2007, Sam Neill said he was not asked to reprise his role as Dr. Alan Grant, while Laura Dern was asked to return for the new film, which Universal still wanted to release by 2008. Director Joe Johnston was also reported not to be directing the film. Richard Attenborough has been contacted about reprising the role of John Hammond. Jeff Goldblum has expressed interest in reprising his role for the fourth film.    In December 2008, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were asked if there was any development on the long-anticipated sequel. Kennedy responded, "No... I don't know. You know, when [Michael] Crichton passed away, I sorta felt maybe that's it. Maybe that's a sign that we don't mess with it." While Marshall and Kennedy were no longer signed with Universal Pictures in a production capacity, the two will remain involved with the studio and its plans for Jurassic Park IV.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	jurrasic park 7 is already in the video stores|`|SWzTydgXaa	It is in development, so any ones guess.

KLNLfYQeaa	I don't think it's the season finale yet..    The twins decide to take the final three contestants on a "romantic getaway" to Las Vegas so everyone can connect on a deeper level. Rebekah, Scott and Trevor are thrilled to discover they'll be staying in a suite at the Hard Rock Hotel that has everything -- even a pool table! The twins arrive and explain that they'll have one group date during the day for everyone and then one-on-one dates at night, where one of them will get to spend time with both twins while the others are left behind.     At elimination, Rebekah is the first to receive her key. When Trevor and Scott are called forward, Trevor tells Rikki how good it felt to say what he said to her the night before. Vikki is annoyed, because it's clear that he told Rikki he loved her and would blatantly choose Rikki over her. He tries to redeem himself by saying he's fallen in love with both of them and it's very confusing for him. Scott speaks up, saying he feels a connection with both girls and knows he'd make a better boyfriend for either of them. In the end, they stick with Trevor and send Scott home.     read the full summary here;  http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_sho...|`|AGbusTqGaa	The show isn't over yet, there's another episode next week.  The last 2 contestants are Trevor and Rebecca.  Next week the twins will choose which one they want to be with.  They went to vegas on this past episode, it wasn't really that interesting.  It was the usual drama between the twins bc Rikki makes out with everyone and Vikki gets mad.  Trevor said hes in love with Rikki but then said that he loves them both, Scott got sent home bc he wasn't even coherent during their date with him.  And everyone knew Rebecca would stay.

Life is not sane, and neither is man.  Man constantly strives to  to make sense out of the insanity of it all.  Man attempts to, and in some cases has to justifies his actions as a result of having to succeed at the demise of the next man.   It all very parasites like really  There is no such thing as race or religion, thats just man categorizing in order to recognize.   Homa sapians wiped out other intelligent bipeds many thousands of years ago.   What we have right now are culture clashes as a result of many mind sets being colloquial, uneducated and indoctrinated.  I.E. Living in our own little world    It's all still very insane as long as primitive mans ego needs to invent where he came from in order to know where he is going. never mind know what he is doing.   Maybe this will always be so.    We are a perpetually, accentuating product of environmental circumstance that has no choice other than to do onto others as was done onto us without incurring some damage and knowledge upon ourselves.  We learn and then perpetuate our behavior whilst exhibiting our hierarchical status, this is what we know as culture.    There is no escape and anyone at any time can become the victim, thats if we are not all victims in the first place.

M1GTfYNpaa	Rupert Holmes      Pina Colada Lyrics        I was tired of my lady  We'd been together too long  Like a worn-out recording  Of a favorite song  So while she lay there sleeping  I read the paper in bed  And in the personal columns  There was this letter I read    "If you like Pina Coladas  And getting caught in the rain  If you're not into yoga  If you have half a brain  If you'd like making love at midnight  In the dunes on the Cape  Then I'm the love that you've looked for  Write to me and escape."    I didn't think about my lady  I know that sounds kind of mean  But me and my old lady  Have fallen into the same old dull routine  So I wrote to the paper  Took out a personal ad  And though I'm nobody's poet  I thought it wasn't half bad    "Yes I like Pina Coladas  And getting caught in the rain  I'm not much into health food  I am into champagne  I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon  And cut through all this red-tape  At a bar called O'Malley's  Where we'll plan our escape."    So I waited with high hopes  And she walked in the place  I knew her smile in an instant  I knew the curve of her face  It was my own lovely lady  And she said, "Oh it's you."  Then we laughed for a moment  And I said, "I never knew."    That you like Pina Coladas  Getting caught in the rain  And the feel of the ocean  And the taste of champagne  If you'd like making love at midnight  In the dunes of the Cape  You're the lady I've looked for  Come with me and escape    repeat chorus twice and fade out|`|TBbhmZEwaa	do you maybe no a line of the lyrics?|`|zR0Dcdevaa	It sounds like it could be "If You Like Pina Coladas"    It's about the man and wife secretly planning dating other people via personal ads, and then when they go for their secret rendezvous, they realize it's each other they were talking to the whole time, and that they have more in common than they thought.   That might not be it though, cause it's definitely not a UK song.|`|e689cde0c9392593f9c414564377d6d9aa	Prodigy - Smack my ***** up..its a love song !|`|pPp2FfDVaa	If you love pina collada  getting caught in the rain  walking at midnight  drinking Champagne.

db84a45eb0515ab20901d52288390598aa	Unfortunately, the best ones are not mass produced. Either look for an independent luthier to try (expensive and risky) or deal with mediocre instruments. I have a "Manuel Rodriguez y Hijos" mod c1. It is the best mass produced classical guitar I found so far. Sorry I could not be of more help.

hJP9y6kjaa	I have a very low opinion of Dean guitars in general. Admittedly, the tone wood is mahogany throughout, which should give a very warm, sustained, solid fundamental tone, but I'm not sold on the brand itself. I would rather go with something I trust (I feel the same way about BC Rich - the quality of construction simply isn't there, except in their higher price points).    I like Ibanez, they tend to have guitars that are friendly to metal players - fast necks, good quality at low price points, etc. I am inclined away from this particular model, mostly because it has a floating trem. Floating trems require a fair bit of maintenance - poorly set up trems will go out of tune easily, the guitar needs to be re set up when you change string gauges, tuning, or break a string. I can't say I'm wild about that!    I like PRS guitars. They tend to play well and sound good. This particular model has mahogany throughout also, which leads me to believe that you'll get a nice thick sound from it as well - good sustain, warmth, etc.    The short answer is that if you want a more "metal" sound, ie more shred, more scooped, then go with the Ibanez (although maybe consider a model without the trem?). The best example I can think of to contrast the PRS is to think Mark Tremonti from Creed / Alter Bridge - a round, thick sound.    The Ibanez has basswood - like my LTD - which means it is middy, but overall brighter than mahogany and more likely to "cut" rather than "chunk". Basswood can have a very "in your face" type of sound. Mahogany tends to be darker, more sustain, warmer, with more of an emphasis on the fundamental tone vs overtones and higher frequency response.    When you start talking high gain, it's important to recognize that your amp and speakers also play a huge role in your overall tone - and the more gain you use, the less important the quality of your guitar's tone, and the more important the pickups, amp, and speaker become!    I personally view Ibanez as being less versatile compared to PRS. I pick up an Ibanez and my hands instantly want to start playing metal riffs - and I'm not a huge metal player, either! I listen to a lot of Tool, Deftones, Coheed and Cambria, and a fair amount of jazz. I get great Tool-ish tones from my LTD, in part because of the brighter, mid-heavy basswood. As long as I control my top end (don't let it get screechy) I can get a good jazz tone as well, and I have no problems with distorted chunk.    On the other hand, rhythm chunk will come easier with a mahogany body, esp if you're looking at nu-metal, drop tunings, etc. You'll probably need to choose your pickups carefully to balance the warmth of the guitar with enough treble to cut through the mix. Overall, it will work very well for rounder cleans, ie smoky blues and the like.    No matter which guitar you get, I would swap out the pickups. Stock pickups and stock strings tend to really blow, even at this price point. I just put an Alternative 8 (bridge) and Alnico II Pro (neck) in my LTD, and I am getting a huge, responsive, very clear tone out of it, one that doesn't mush or mud up, even with high gain - me likey! They coil-tap well, and the A2P gives a sweet lead tone, plenty of sustain, etc. Seymour Duncan rules - you can get a JB for an all-purpose (and somewhat well-behaved) sound, something like a Duncan Custom or Duncan Distortion for a little more crunch, the Alternative 8 or Full Shred for responsive dynamic high output, or the Invaders for high-output "pretty-much-nothing-but metal" tone.     Good luck, whichever way you go!      Saul|`|xtSVPNZyaa	For Dragonforce, escape the fate etc, the ibanez is the way to go    but the Dean would still do alright too    I would stay away from the PRS if i was you, but they are great looking guitars nonetheless.  Not quite the sound your looking for.      in the end its the amp you have that determines the true sound of the music your playing.  ibanez are good for shredding but, so i think you should buy that|`|bribxhsdaa	Soul = PRS...I played "Black Magic Woman" on a green PRS at a shop called "Turnkey" one of the best guitars i've ever played.    Shred = Dean...Jackson, ESP etc. are all dope for shredding,riffage.  I don't like the sound of too much distortion on anything with humbuckers (personal preference...) i think it can sometimes sound muddy. So that's up to you.    Ibanez is great for all of the above TBH but (as dumb as it sounds) i don't like the idea of playing soul/blues etc on such a futuristic looking guitar...(But it's definitely the most diverse of the 3 brands)    I'd recommend you a Ibanez or PRS as far as diverse quality of tones go.     But DEFINITELY go into a store and play some of the guitars you mentioned....That might prove more helpful than any advice you'll get here.|`|XhZ1cnbWaa	I have an Ibanez RG350DX and can tell you it's a fantastic guitar for the styles you're looking to play!|`|L55jPx8iaa	PRS is the better guitar.

That being said, I own 3 electric guitars and one is an Ibanez and none are PRS.|`|waDKbT61aa	For the bands listed I'd choose the Ibanez.|`|o4IHt3EAaa	you better Choose Ibanez because the quality  of Ibanez Are Unbeatable,plus Ibanez pick up are better than other and if u want to do fast shredding like Dragonforce,Ibanez guitar are the most appropriate instrument to use|`|cVqCryr6aa	Your taste in music needs work.

khU8m4gxaa	True, he worked with a lot of quality artist and producers, but I think it wasn't well recieved because he went so far outside of his previous work. He possibly was trying too hard to be different. I appreciate versatility and growth in an artist, but different doesn't always equal better. It just wasn't a very good CD. I'll admit though, I saw him live on the Electric Circus tour, and he had a live band & it was hot. Just didn't translate on the album.|`|iPoWzRSVaa	i agree wit the guy chuck norris|`|hpdZDBVQaa	I like it.|`|VclnZhSCaa	That album made more weird noises than a high school garage band.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	I think that Common failed to realize how close minded Hip Hop listeners are.

I don't think his Dad has any "pull" with the A-I people.|`|O71xlcG3aa	You know what I can't figure out is why people say they are planted, like that other girl who already had the record contract before...it's not like she became famous so really she still wants to be the american idol...but of course he is legitimate, he isn't famous and he hasn't made it yet|`|uGFzzLYWaa	I don't think so.   I liked David, but I don't think he's going to make it all the way.  I thought that there were singers that were better than he was, but I kind of was also thinking that just being an Osmond could get you some sort of future in the music industry, if desired.   With Marie on the TV and Donny is thinking about "Dancing with the Stars", another Osmond on a show kind of brings the family into the 21st century. I don't have a problem with it, I think they have a great family with good values. I'd take the Osmonds over the Kardashians any day of the week.|`|a950da063e9c670dfa13b1fd89d288ddaa	Well yes and no. Yes in his name being famous. No b/c he didn't look like the type of guy willing to be a plant on the show.   Ether way he won't make it. He's too broadway.|`|Xkas9BG2aa	I live in Salt Lake City but don't have a tv...so didn't see American Idol...though have seen the show in the past.  On a local radio station this morning, they mentioned an Osmond was on the show...so yes he's legitimate...one of the Osmond Brothers son.  It was early so had the radio low as to not disturb my neighbors...plus was doing stuff around the apt. so didn't get more details other then that.  Though they did say that the AI filmed atop the arena so showed a nice view of Salt Lake.  A great city to live in!    PS What set up?...aren't the tv viewers who decide who wins?!  If they want him to win, he'll win.

yJmjg9sEaa	I'm laughing because when I saw the link to your question and it just said "What's your weird fetish?" I was already thinking... I really like the idea of vampires biting (but not killing) humans and both the vamp and the human enjoy it.    My fiancee and I do a lot of role-playing. We haven't done it with a vampire and vampire-slayer, mostly because we didn't get together until after we'd both moved on from the Vampire Slayer TV show. We roleplay other characters, though, like different superheroes. It's whoever we're both excited about, character/show/movie/book whatever. And lately the story we're into has vampires, and also werewolves, and so we've been having a LOT of fun roleplaying the biting, and growling and stuff.    Role-playing is pretty awesome, so long as you can find somebody who will play those kind of games with you!|`|WiQQUNQLaa	i kinda like it when guys lick my ear|`|rCfHQ2oXaa	pad locks, jello, a babby goat, and half a gallon of rocky road ice cream.

1pZAoR5maa	I woke up like 20 minutes ago and my hair is really flippy so I am going to iron it. Boring story I know but that's all I have done today...    Let's see something else.... When talking with my little cousin (shes 9 but she's never been anywhere south of Tennessee) who lives in MA asked me how much snow we got in Miami (where I live). I looked at her told her that it does not snow in FL. She looked at me bewildered and asked "But I thought that when we got a lot of snow here that you guys got like flurries or something down there?!". So I told her that the last time it snowed was like 1992. Her chin dropped and she said "I never want to live in Miami" and I told her neither do I.|`|rdVlcdQXaa	i got stung by a jellyfish today.....  ^^      wow i should be an author =P|`|FiXv3E8Eaa	I once fasted 2 full days... when I finally ate, what I had was the best meal ever, even though it was crappy eggs.|`|VWXXmL74aa	I fell down my driveway this morning because it is a sheet of ice and everything in my purse went flying.

LBovv7Sxaa	This episode made me think about a lot of things.    The jughead A-bomb is the "accident" from the first hatch (the swan).    Richard hasn't been time traveling. He's just really old and never physically ages.    Lockes sole reason for being on the island, being "special" and becoming the new leader  of the others is because he told richard when and where he would be born.  Then richard will see Locke being born, realize he was telling the truth about time traveling, and follow up with him as he gets older.|`|bYfa7a4iaa	I've never seen an episode, but if I do, I'll be sure to come back and edit my answer.|`|NcNxIsynaa	since I didn't watch it from the beginning I can't ever follow it so I quit trying|`|hgyiS7Glaa	I will agree, as for the past few weeks, i caught up from last year. Watch a 3 hour premiere, (TWICE),i get confused easily. And last night i recorded it so i can watch maybe Saturday.    Freckles, yeah i would Do Her, Jack reminds me of GcG,with a beard,(noHomo) His Dad was a manwhore, i mean kids all around the world. AND why does that dude gotta roam thru the jungle with no shirt, not clean shaven, and his favorite line,seems to be Sonoffbitch??|`|lKfqFPGUaa	I don't know if it's the best, but it is one of the best ever.    Locke is destined to do something very special.  We know his dying in the future is no accident.     As for last night's episode, it was mostly frustrating and not their best episode, not much happened, but the best part of it was when you found out the young man with Jones on his uniform was Widmore.  Cool that Penny and Desmond named the baby Charlie, more taken after the fallen Charlie than daddy Widmore.  Could do without the Charlotte/Faraday courtship, it's just kinda weird and uninteresting.|`|fQghpx3Zaa	YES!    I honestly think this is the best show on TV. It's freaking incredible. Those writers are my heroes. I've never been so into and obsessed with a show in my life. I love it! It's so entertaining and exciting.    Anyone who doesn't like this is CRAZY. It's brilliant! :)|`|DzIlM76Xaa	I gave up halfway through season one.|`|AsXK0xD5aa	no one knows with that retarded show|`|x2rmsjIXaa	that's the kind of show that i need to get on dvd , because i can never manage to catch it every week , and if you miss one thing you're lost.     in fact, i think thats the real reason they called it that, you know...|`|NY4ectQcaa	Sorry-- but I have to disagree. Maybe Lost was a good show, but the BEST show is definitely Boy Meets World (in my book). It ran seven long successful seasons from fall of 1993 to the last one beginning in fall of 2000. This show is a classic love story between a boy, Cory Matthews, and a girl, Topanga Lawrence. That show had the power to make you cry, gasp (in shock), and laugh your face-- socks, butt, and other body parts-- off.|`|NSgSaspAaa	WOW...I can't believe people are even putting Lost in the same sentence with "best show ever."    I know everyone likes their own material, but this show is beyond pointless.|`|lC5NLsZZaa	I luv Lost to death. That's why I am not allowed to watch it by my family and I haven't downloaded it from the Internet yet.    That makes my dipsydoodle sad....|`|FkhFIIsjaa	Lost is on at the same time as Top Chef, and you know I love that show.  Best show ever...? *thinking*  I would say "The Bachelor."  Nothing is better than watching 25 grown women get into 14 cat fights an hour over some guy who will probably never marry any of them.  That is what I call good entertainment.  *cries and storms off*|`|3FFAIMpLaa	Obviously you forget The Dukes of Hazard...  I'll overlook it this one time.  Good to see you!|`|jENl8y24aa	I am a bit biased but I'd like to submit this as the best tv show ever:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bob_New...|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Lost is the best show in the history of television.|`|GBKaftrJaa	Oh yes, it's the best show I've ever seen.  It makes one think.    And the entire show is about time travel and that's why in previous seasons they did the flash forwards and flash backs.    I loved seeing Richard so agitated at giving John the compass last week when he had tried to give John the compass when he was a little boy but John chose the knife.    And since Charles Widmore is such an angry vindictive man now, I wasn't surprised at all to see him being so spastic as a young man.    And Charlotte said she wanted to go to the island where she was born so one of the Others must have given birth to her and I figured it was the woman who took Daniel to the bomb since he was commenting on how much she looked like someone.    And the Hawking woman who is Daniel's mom... I'm not sure about her yet but I didn't see all of last night's episode yet.  I'm wondering if Desmond has to go back to the island and if so will he take Penny and his son.|`|QJ19OBCbaa	I'm afraid that title goes to the Golden Girls. I have no insight about anything. There is nothing further to discuss. Dismissed.
r41aUboUaa	At the moment, it is effective from sentencing.  Ridiculous, I know but it is one of the most stupid things in law at the moment.  There are so many idiots out there who have been banned from driving for, say, 2 years, and are then sent to prison for 4 years and as they will not be driving while residing at her Majesty's prison, will be able to drive off immediately on release from prison.  So really, the 'punishment' does not have a use.  Brake, the road safety charity is campaigning to have this legislation changed.    I know, because I am involved in road safety and signed a petition last week for a change in the law.   So for all the 'know alls' out there, take note.|`|mggll8dRaa	Hopefully, after the release, Who needs them on our roads....??|`|mobG2SVZaa	starts at sentencing|`|XOnk1rBcaa	End of sentence. Liar.|`|ZnMLkSeQaa	it does start as soon as you are sentenced|`|XsmPnMU4aa	The only way you will go to prison for a driving offense is if it is multiple DUI's or DUS's and if you have enough of them to go to prison your most likely never getting your license back anyways.|`|8UDCdXvOaa	If you are in the UK it will start When you are sentenced you will only do half your time inside your ban is still the same   For a ban of that long you or your friend? will have to retake your test both parts your insurance will be so high you cannot afford to drive anyway.|`|rpqHLJGGaa	They`re right|`|gYThMID8aa	It starts on the day you are sentenced but there are moves afoot to have it changed to your release date.
YdmITu36aa	You have obviously never ridden in a rowboat down a river in Georgia|`|UYYbFgcgaa	Yes it is|`|Hu0OkY6kaa	I would say so. Just because you play banjo dosn't mean your a hick from the deep south.|`|rhCYFWM4aa	No,Its music of joy and sorrow.|`|5TbK3HCOaa	i think so|`|fHxpycJSaa	The hillbilly angels who wear coveralls instead of wings. Everytime "Deliverance" is played, a hillbilly angel gets its wings.|`|mggll8dRaa	It's Happy Music....!!|`|7sXNwFynaa	no crack music is|`|frwlypDWaa	Hang on...        My sister says it is...|`|OXleDYVQaa	Um, it's kinda hard to play "The Devil Went Down To Georgia" on a Harp.    Dallas|`|aKBqMLuhaa	no, the steel guitar, mandolin, and fiddle are. But a banjo compliments them very well.|`|zY64xc6xaa	Yeah.    The Hell's Angels.|`|d7700e32c034b0231bc54ef45dd9e791aa	That would be a harp.  Unless you go down south.|`|GRa8dmx7aa	No - I don't think so.  I thought harps were angelic...|`|8UHWm3j4aa	no, SlipKnot is the music of angels|`|cNdkNYKOaa	watch deliverance and tell me what banjo music is    i think it is a warning to run

17cmDNyGaa	Disney XD will be an American cable television channel owned by The Walt Disney Company that will mostly air children's animated television series. The network is scheduled to launch on February 13, 2009 as the successor to Toon Disney. Its target market will be aimed at boys aged 6 to 14 as a compliment to Disney Channel, which has redirected its own programming strategy towards girls in the same age range.|`|YRmjoluqaa	I'm not 100% sure, but I think that's it's like a new thing for older teenagers than what target age is. They don't have a large demographic with Hannah Montana and the Suite Life. Lol!  But Don't quote me on what it is!
yLa0PVqUaa	Lol. . .that was cute!|`|CaHs4uloaa	.....|`|nRtf72u8aa	LMAO!!|`|kfuA1RBoaa	haha|`|bMr7g2pUaa	It's ok, but its not great.|`|8sYPIgUraa	Love it! Here is one for you!    Living Will   Last night, my cowgirl friend and I were sitting in the parlor and I said to her, 'I never want to live in a vegetative state, dependent on some machine and fluids from a bottle. If that ever happens, just pull the plug.'    She got up, unplugged the computer, and threw out my wine.|`|wBE7MQojaa	That is pretty funny!|`|aqXFnZpkaa	LOL that was funny     heres 1 for ya     There was this guy at a bar, just looking at his drink. He stays like that for half of an hour.    Then, this big trouble-making truck driver steps next to him, takes the drink from the guy, and just drinks it all down. The poor man starts crying. The truck driver says, "Come on man, I was just joking. Here, I'll buy you another drink. I just can't stand to see a man cry."    "No, it's not that. This day is the worst of my life. First, I fall asleep, and I go late to my office. My boss, outrageous, fires me. When I leave the building, to my car, I found out it was stolen. The police said that they can do nothing. I get a cab to return home, and when I leave it, I remember I left my wallet and credit cards there. The cab driver just drives away."    "I go home, and when I get there, I find my wife in bed with the gardener. I leave home, and come to this bar. And just when I was thinking about putting an end to my life, you show up and drink my poison."|`|2ac10106c0b1d6c0f702c4d23002e3b7aa	superman needs to get a better job and stop making people die. he's just like hancock. drinking on the job. i hope he smashes into a building and gets sent to prison and a rehab place for his drinking...it was hilarious|`|O4atxtCkaa	he hi ho hu it z funny man!|`|AA11475052	not funny, you lied to me.

It looks like she has the same size chest then than she does now, so I guess she's just an early developer.|`|AA10277384	It's different for every girl...    Some develop sooner, some develop later. Some look less developed, while others look more developed.    So there is no "normal" age/rate for girls to develop (it depends on each individual).

283tO9j9aa	1. Wah pedals. I'm a big fan of Slash.  2. Nah, I prefer guitar players who play with emotion to shredders. If people can do both that's great, but in my opinion Buckethead can't.  3. Gibson Explorers. I'm totally gay for Gibson guitars.  4. The dude has the funk, I approve. I'll never like him more than John Paul Jones, but yeah, he's good.  5. Yes.

4kuWOZowaa	I hope soon..ready to see what kind of cacaution she is gonna come up with now...hehehe|`|q6ogfhnMaa	girl, No one really knows about her, i mean she can get out in a few weeks then again she can stay in there for a couple of mths, so no one really knows!|`|nndflDc9aa	We dont know yet .But I hope is soon. Maybe right after Cathrine case is over? It want be long for sure.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I guess it will be soon, because Victor had came to see her a couple of days ago and had offered her several offers, I bet it has something to do with her getting out of the slammer.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Don't know, but l'm guessing it won't be long again since she has Victor Newman on her side and maybe Michael will get the info on the guy who's wife died from the face cream and she'll be set free.|`|GomZ9oYHaa	Prob wont be long but im sure Kevin and Michael are glad she's in there for a while and outta their hair..|`|ow1m3c8jaa	Probably not too much longer since she just accepted Victor's offer to sell him Kay's Jabot stocks and he's supposed to help her get out.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	I have a feeling it's not going to be any time soon
uD1S5dYtaa	Same as with all of his relationships- the first time she stands up for something he doesn't approve of she'll get the heave ho.  Because he is all-knowing, all-seeing VICTORNEWMAN!|`|nndflDc9aa	I hope it last . I like them 2ghter ashly understanding Victor better then Nikki so yea longer it takes. Hope she forgive him cause her brother try to  do the same think to him . So she cant take side only can help both maybe to get along Lol but will tha day ever happen ? Lol we never know .|`|4kuWOZowaa	Its not gonna last long...they are moving way to fast..so shes in for a heart break..."family pictures" whatever..lol|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I really don't think it would last long, it never does, especially when he has a 30 year history with this woman. He has a connection with Nikki, he would always find his way back to her.|`|OcCG1pruaa	ha, i guess not, Ashley wants nothing more than to be with Victor, so she will stay with him thru the tough parts!|`|uUzbqGh5aa	A long time l hope, l can't stand self-righteous Nikki sometimes. She and Paul are happy together so l don't think it's fair for Victor to always be without someone in his life.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	I think things will start to go wrong when Brad's murdered|`|ow1m3c8jaa	There's rumors going around that say that is what is going to happen, and it would serve Ashley right for being so smug with Nikki about Ashley and Victor's relationship!|`|1d8ff4af85cfc3c1463d61e54d554260aa	I agree with you Lucy. Victor and Jack are always scheming against each other.|`|jCHcjJ9Baa	I don't think it will last long.  They have been together before and never for long.  His heart belongs to Nikki and I think they will be back together.
uwds1QuVaa	I think Tyra and Neil should get her.  For all intents and purposes, she IS Tyra's daughter.  She is the only Mother she has ever known.  And even though I understand that Karen can't have children and Ana may be her only chance to be a Mother  - she can't steal someone else's child away!!  I hate what Karen is doing and I am glad that Ana said that she wouldn't call her "Mama Karen."  So Tyra should get her and then she and Neil can end up together.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	I just wish Tyra had confessed her feelings for Neil BEFORE he got married instead of locking lips with him after. l don't mind Neil and Karen ending up with Anna, but l'm not happy about the way Karen wants to exclude Tyra from the decision making.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	The character Ana is kind of sickening. They may as well put a glowing halo over her head and play violin music when she's on screen. I hope they give her back to Tyra so the two of them can drive back to Seattle.|`|nndflDc9aa	It look tha way from the day Tyra walks on the show that something betweeen them will happpen and Ana case prefect for them to put them 2ghter.And now Tyra feelings is right open it want be long that she win him over.|`|4kuWOZowaa	Good Question...thoughts pondering somewhere.|`|ow1m3c8jaa	I don't know, but I sure hope not!    Tyra has been after Neil from the very beginning when she first came to Genoa City and there is just something about her I don't trust, and can't believe the passionate kiss she had the nerve to plant on Neil knowing he was married to Karen.    I also keep thinking she has some deep dark secret that no one knows about yet, but will come out later and what ever it is, it's not going to be good.    I really like Karen & Neil together and wish Tyra would just leave them alone and Anna ends up with them.|`|OcCG1pruaa	Oh yeah, that's the plan atleast, so i think that Neil and Tyra will get together in the end, and they will have Anna!
Am1wfhBDaa	Phyllis catches them through the window in bed together and blows the cabin up with Dynamite. (next, on the Young and the Restless.)|`|XRPtuwoTaa	yes|`|GomZ9oYHaa	Yes more than likely she will..this should be good.|`|ow1m3c8jaa	She does, and gets so angry that she pulls a gun on Sharon, but misses and gets Brad instead.|`|PRDZmeiEaa	I hope so...Then I want to her to just leave Nick b/c he's obviously still has beautiful LOVE for miss goody two shoes Sharon,lol. It's so over, I just hope she see's it and moves on with her life for Summers sake.|`|nndflDc9aa	1 word=Explosion.|`|4kuWOZowaa	Wow...I wish she kills sharon if she does! Omg..the drama the drama the Drama    SHARON NEWMAN MUST DIE!|`|rYA2KCnUaa	Yes, she is going to catch them and she is going to get again just like she was hurt again the day on the bridge when they had kissed in Paris.|`|uwds1QuVaa	I think she will.  And I think it's about time that Sharon and Nick get back together!  You could see in Paris, how much they still love each other.  I just don't buy Nick loving Phyllis as much.  When Nick and Phyllis first got together, I really liked them.  But now they are sooo annoying!  Well, Phyllis is anyway!  I am so sick of her insecurity.  And what goes around, comes around - and Phyllis deserves to get what's coming to her!|`|uUzbqGh5aa	I wish she does, and instead of going ballistic, she just knocks on the door and watch THEM go crazy knowing that they were caught, RED HANDED! But hey what are the chances of that happening huh!
4kEuzSpkaa	It's actually one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I wouldn't say it was as psychologically terrifying as some others I've seen, but just for lots of really scary "jump out of your shirt" moments - there's none better.    It also has some scenes that seemed a bit sickening at the time, but having re-watched recently they don't seem quite so bad now, since some of the special effects are obviously quite dated, and perhaps don't seem quite so "special" any more.    It's also a simply great piece of Science Fiction suspense, based on John. W Campbell, Jr's all-time classic story "Who Goes There?"    Campbell was the Editor of "Astounding Science Fiction" in the 1930s, and is credited with discovering such great writing talents as Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, Theodore Sturgeon and Arthur. C Clarke.    I would say you should definitely watch it. Yes you'll be scared watching it, but that's as it should be and indeed what is intended. It's certainly one of Carpenter's best, if not his absolute best. If your a fan of his films, you'll never forgive yourself if you miss it.|`|7RQDM1HGaa	NO it's really lame not scary at all|`|7ByBv52Eaa	Ya very scary, def a must see for any horror movie fan|`|xhH3cB1Raa	Not really scary but very suspenseful excellent excellent movie. Carpenter's best.|`|jkXYlKJzaa	are u talking bout the newer one cos yeah i saw it and its gd|`|l6ajMoVFaa	yes. scariest. movie. ever.|`|5Iq77gujaa	yes it is  very scary.|`|AA11875616	The setting and the music and the characters make it one of the all-time classic horror/sci-fi movies to see!

FVs2GRxGaa	Personally I think Maria's is better...   Not only because she actually keeps her body in shape and doesn't turn to plastic surgery to enhance or de-enhance anything. All of that is her...all she has to do to maintain that is go out and do the thing she loves to do - play tennis! Pam will have to buy new breasts every so often..as well as keep her lips plumped like that. All of that can be taken away, her beauty is superficial and fake. She paid for it. Whereas Maria has it naturally..|`|dATJNcZcaa	Although I love Pammy, in answer to your question, Maria has the best body.

I know that almost anyone except Angelina Jolie looks better than Pamela Anderson. I think Pam and I are the same height, but I have a natural 36"/24"/36" figure and legs in proportion.

GBKaftrJaa	Yes, that's exactly what I figured too. Since Daniel told the Others to seal that bomb up underground in concrete, and Charles Widmore was there... he then sent the Dharma people there later, that he paid for, so if the bomb was already buried he would have known to encase it in more concrete and how to set up that safety switch to release the magnetic pressure of the island so it wouldn't explode.|`|AA12315431	oooohhhhh! This a good theory and it makes sense. My jaw dropped when we met the young Charles Widmore. But if the bomb went off in the first hatch, why are they only experiencing time travel now AFTER Ben "moved" the island? If the hatch where the reset button was destroyed, why wasn't time being affected right afterward?|`|k4GqiB6taa	I loved this episode!  You know I never thought of that,The Swan could be a bomb.  But what about all the magnetic charges and what not?  I knew somehow Charles Widmore has been to the island before,if not then why would he be looking for it?  Ohh yeah,and Desmond named his baby after the man who kept Penny and Desmond apart(Charles) and the man who brought them together(Charlie Pace)|`|AA10196640	But then when they exploded the hatch, wouldn't the entire Island have exploded? I hadn't thought of that tho... Interesting!    And I know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe Charles was on the Island! Thatmay explain why he hates it so much.|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	I love Lost, but I have to admit that last night confused me. Your question answered so many questions. Kudos to Joe C. because he cleared up other questions for me as well. Such a great show!|`|7XM4QJiuaa	That makes since.|`|57f6ab92048e820f90e75894de592233aa	I think you are right. The concrete protected the bomb when it imploded. Pushing the button did mean something. Des was "saving the world". Maybe that's why pregnant women are effected, because of the radiation. Very good episode. Lots of answered questions. Plus that Ellie girl will turn out to be Eliose Hawkins. Daniel kept looking at her strange.|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	I think that the bomb was buried under where the Orchid station was constructed. Remember that Faraday is in this season's first episode with Dharma when that are drilling into something that melts the drill bits.    BTW I've always thought that the Others are survivors of the Black Rock shipwreck and Widmore was one of the ship's crew. Remember that he was at the London auction buying the painting of the Black Rock and the ship's log that was written by the First Officier. Richard is that First Officer. Widmore left the island and started aging. Richard stays there most of the time and doesn't age.    As for the 108 minute button. It's a reset for the time loop that is happening on the Island. That is why no one ages there. The island is like a record skipping and the button was the reset. See link for a wild time travel theory.    Suzie Q: The others killed the military and stole their uniforms. Richard and Widmore are not in the Army. Widmore is British.  The baby was named Charlie after the Charlie that died in the underwater chamber and saved Desmond and the rest of the islanders.|`|uud7GAv1aa	I think you guys are right on!|`|DUg1IkTIaa	Nah, I don't think so.  Daniel said to "seal" the leak in the Jughead bomb with concrete or lead, then bury it in the ground.    You could be right about the numbers and the fact there is now more temporal displacements.    Charles Widmore was on the island in 1954.  It looked like some kind of military unit, but I don't get the connection to "The Others".  What I did catch is that Desmond and Penny named their baby "Charlie".  Whoa!  If they are using the Widmore name, that might be Charles as a baby.  Talk about confusing !!!|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I think you are right about the bomb theory!!  And notice, the white light they saw when it went up and the white light they keep seeing as they travel thru time is the same.|`|PAzDgYOXaa	YEAH i no  that was a really great one   i had thought of it but i do believe that you are  correct   but what about richard whats the deal   hes still  the same richard its odd i have theories about that

wi6mkT30aa	Geez people calm down the girl is just asking a simple question, isn't that what this place is for? Grow up for all the rude answers!      Some people are just completely rude for no reason, I don't get it!      Anyways hon, Michael Jackson was born a black male. He seriously has changed over the years and has had a ton of operations to his skin.     He has bleached out his skin so many times to try and lighten it now that he has to walk around with a umberlla and wear sun glasses because his skin is damaged. It's sad!    Also he has had so many nose surgeries that it is pretty much thin and people have said the tip had to be put back on after it fell off.     He was a really great looking man back in the day, but since he's been doing all these surgeries he has really messed his face up and health.       I really don't know why he choice to do this to himself but oh well. I hope this answers your question, don't worry about the rude people!|`|66b5bc1d43679f832ad9aac6cd2007d1aa	lol-!  He was not born a girl..  He is a male.  But he was born brown, but he's skin changed lighter due  to cosmetic surgery.|`|gebIjqnWaa	Don't give any credibility to that. They are pulling your leg.|`|qoh1iNi9aa	No. He was a guy. You're thinking of his sister LaToya.|`|AA10916001	Of course not....don't be ridiculous.    If you believe that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to sell you.....|`|F5dXng7jaa	Good question kid, its not wrong to ask.  He was born a male, he is a male and he will always be one. Would you like to ask another one?|`|XLAxyOEDaa	No!  he was born male|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	No.  Just watch the old Jackson 5 tapes.  He looked just like his brothers.|`|x68KtQUcaa	he was born black male....and he was very pretty before operations....|`|sbmzMVLraa	No he is a male and he was born brown but now his colour has changed to white as he has had lots of cosmetic sugary.    Michael Jackson|`|qiyLq6CRaa	no|`|8JlniZLMaa	wtf?? no he was always a guy!|`|WtylUE0waa	nooo.he is a born guy.whtever may be he now!!|`|ftBNXLEHaa	i think he was,yep operation was a must, he's too feminine, no natural human can move like a girl and was born a man,i'm a black man and he couldn't be one.
AA12390047	Aidan is acting so weird.  He's either trying to prove that she's faking or he's trying to help her.  He just wants to get even with Ryan for taking Greenlee from him.  Posing as Mr. Stone is crazy because Annie obviously doesn't remember him unless she's faking that too.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	He lied his way in, why is still unknown, maybe to protect her or maybe to trap her.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	I think he wants to break her out of there so they can get back at Ryan and Greenlee.|`|czY7K8yKaa	Annie and Aidan are both in Oak Haven and there rooms are next to each other.  They talk through the vent, Aidan paid to get himself in Oak haven but has since become a patient on Dr. Sinclair and she has even tried to make him talk by using shock therapy.  I don't think that Anne knows that Mr. Stone is Aidan, if she does she hasn't let on to it.|`|jfriQ8pmaa	I think initially he went in to protect himself from Annie telling how much he was involved with Emma's fake kidnapping.  But now he suspects Dr Sinclair is up to something else, he wants to protect her. He had a dr who knew he was there undercover, but not sure what happened to him.    I think Richie was Dr Sinclairs patient and she feel in love with him, since Annie killed him she is determined to make her pay.|`|QAIc4VVPaa	he is protecting her for sure but whether it is for his own good i am not sure. what did he do or know about richies death. i think he was the actual killer. yes she hit him but who actually do the final wam? why would he want him dead. why is he on her side if not that or the fact that their mates ended up together.|`|IoPvt2tcaa	It started out that he is posing as a patient named Stone and I think he is trying to prove that she is not crazy.|`|MAe6QyrMaa	he is posing as a patient named stone, and he thinks that Annie is not crazy, the doctor working with annie thinks that she is faking it and wants to prove it so Annie goes to prison for life.
EG1ssjJcaa	I don't know and I have wondered the same thing.  Something that annoys me the few times I've watched it is that Charlie wears the SAME kind of shirt every single episode!  That silky button up shirt with two wide stripes in the front. ..and of course khaki shots  Ah!!!!|`|MtN2xgoSaa	two and a half men is just funny as hell. simple as that.|`|a950da063e9c670dfa13b1fd89d288ddaa	It's surpposed to be funny. Plus Charlie is a big famous name so his fans might watch the show.   I'm tired of the show too. I used to find it funny but now I don't. Not even the tall skinny dude from The Drew Carry Show can save it.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	i dont know either. i think its really stupid. charlie sheen is a bad actor. nothing like his father...|`|AA11452399	Well if you dont get it, then there's really no explanation gonna give it to you. My husband & I love this show. We laugh at every episode. We love it and so do most all the people we know and family too. I think its hilarious, as I did Seinfeld, Everybody Loves Raymond, & MASH, some other popular sitcoms.|`|x8A8DnpPaa	It's got well written jokes, the actors play the characters well, and they have good chemistry.  It's one of my favorite shows.    Women and sex never gets old

956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	Chapman's next court date for the terroristic threatening charges is set for January 24. The indecent exposure charges are still pending. He was released on $11,000 bail after officially being charged with first-degree terroristic threatening. According to the Star Bulletin, this is a Class C felony which is punishable by a maximum of four years in prison.    Marc Berman of "Mediaweek" one of America's leading TV analysts, believes the revelations about Chapman's earlier conviction for indecent exposure resulting from public masturbation could spell the end for the show on the A&E Network. "This is serious. Remember what happned to Pee-Wee Herman. You are sending a very bad message to your audience if you support something like this. "It's very possible this show will be taken off the air for good-and maybe it should be! "You have to take a stand and say: "I can't have this on my network.'"
1Z0Lmrk1aa	No and I never will. I am very open minded man, but that is disgusting.|`|psnaJcvpaa	I am very sorry,but I can't stop laughing at your question lol (I apologise if your serious) but I have never heard of this 'act') or is it that I am just getting too old?! lol) Mind you,that is really disgusting anyway and I am quite laidback in most things....    I know what a country 'bumpkin' is.....A guy who lives out in the country.ie. yokel etc...    Anyway,I have never done it and don't know anyone who has, so I am gonna have to do what your username says...Don't take you seriously' LOL|`|NcufdPaAaa	I thought it was a blue pumpkin.    lol stay safe and have a nice day :)!

fk9AvB25aa	A couple of weeks before that she was slapping him and now she's in love with him. Rick also gets away with a lot of stupid things. I'm sick of writers putting people together who could be practically related (I know they are not techinically related, Massimo being Ridge's father and Taylor being Steffie's mother, Erick and Brook are the parents of Rick).|`|BwHoLEHvaa	Someone needs to "slap" some sense into both of them!  Steffy was supposed to be so torn up over Phoebe's death....it didn't take her long to sleep with Rick.    I think they both need to take a "hike".|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I DO !!!!    I'm so sick of the interbreeding going on with the Forrester's and Logans I could vomit ! This soap has truly gone down !|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I had definitely feels the same, I really don't think they are the perfect match for one another.  Also agree that its disgusting that Rick moved from the Phoebe to her mother Taylor and then to Steffy, I really think that is dumb.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	I agree! Heck it's so sickening what the writers continues to do on the B&B! He's as much a man-who-re as his mother! The sickening thing about it is that Taylor once was and Steffy and Phoebe both ARE Forresters, same as Rick!!!|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I heard a spoiler that Rick will be in Genoa City for a visit.  Maybe to look up Ashley?  Who knows.  Yeah, this is getting old.    Is Rick just so wonderful that everyone falls for him?    Or is he so desperate that he thinks he has to have someone every minute?    It's crazy stuff.  I don't see the chemistry with he and Steffy at all.|`|nndflDc9aa	Can you believe that? Already love or just atttraction? Either is just distgusting and crazy  that Rick went from 2 sisters and the mother shame.Rick think he can handle relationship but let see how he handle this 1. Lol with Sthepanie and Ridge and Storm and Felicia hates him much... that will bring Rick and Steffy closer.Hate when he Broke Phoebe heart but this one Steffy is ready to take the same chance so goood luck 4 her.lol

AA11601079	I saw it at a free sneak preview long before all of the hype began, and I thought it was one of the best movies I'd seen all year. Yes, it was predictable, but I still found myself completely emotionally engaged and rooting for the main characters.     Plus, I liked that it showed so much about Indian culture - the greed, the poverty and plights that some people experience, the cruelty of living on the streets, the sights like the Taj Mahal, the religious tensions, etc. It was a very well-rounded film.|`|sp4rAT3gaa	I haven't seen it but apparently it's developed from a book which I've read.|`|7j27JvS6aa	I didn't have English subtitles, and I have trouble understanding their Indian-English accent.. So I think I missed a part of the movie. Anyway, I am going to watch it next week when the English subtitles are available. So far, I think it's one of the best movies of the year. 10 Oscar nominees!!!|`|juTQEZWoaa	if you like it so much why are you calling it scumdog millionaire it wasnt bad would have loved it if it werent for the gay dancing and singing|`|AhO0Uoppaa	downloaded it last night picture is great, gonna watch it today|`|jLvlcoFBaa	I think you should check your typing better.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	You mean Slumdog (not Scumdog - lol!)

BjNKpy4Eaa	I think if you listen to the lyrics its really a love song, about wanting to take the person you love's troubles and pain away, and telling them what you love about them    "I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away."    "I wanted you to know, that I love the way you laugh"    I think those to lines ^^^ really define the song.    One of my absolute favourite songs ever.|`|HZuLVEEsaa	I think its a love song, it seems to be more about being apart for any reason rather than having broken up altogether, i love it.
sjD26raeaa	Yes- http://national-treasure-3-trailer.blogs...    http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews...  novemebr 5th 2008  As far as approaching the sequels for "National Treasure" and "Pirates of the Caribbean," Bruckheimer says that both are having scripts written    Yayoo!answerers- the object to Y!A is to answer the question|`|iQAGeVjsaa	Hope not but prolly so|`|MGDtjCK1aa	hopefully not. those movies were terrible.|`|hErzvFReaa	I believe there is one being made.  Or at least I hope there is!|`|9VaWal2Daa	I truly enjoyed the first movie..........haven't had the pleasure yet of seeing the second.......but look foward to it, and yes, I have heard talk aleady of a 3rd and even a 4th National Treasure movie.     There are many great old legends out there, and Ben Gates can still find all sorts of things!!!!!!!    I think it's wonderful franchise idea.......and would make a great series.     My understanding is.......NT3 is currently under development.|`|hDSENEUyaa	DEFINITELY, since the last one left unanswered questions, and the 1st 2 films both made a bundle at the box office and on dvd sales.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	National Treasure 3 is already in development for a 2010 release.
DFTB95BQaa	As with TJ, not really my kind of music.    That said, if I would not call it crap, I would also not say it will bring you a recording contract. It lacks The spark...    And, as an ex-sound engineer, you need to roll back the vocal track. You can barely hear the music behind it.    Good luck.      Edit = Lol. You must not be the singer then...    Edit2 = Nothing much unusual in the art world. I am an artist myself and have worked with quite a few of them, especially musicians both as a photographer and as an engineer, and it is a world of big egos.    And since we're talking music here, I have found that: 1/ musicians who know the least about the technical aspect of things are often the ones pushing for the worst choices. They just can't be told anything. And 2/ front-men such as singers and guitars tend to have bigger egos than the rest of the band. Thus my guess that you are not the singer...|`|52d7946ffad38d1d5fd6f67a2466e2c9aa	Yea just listened to ur track it ok beat pattern hook n rap breakdwn.    The vocal levels seems to be high n low in parts. I think when the rapper came in.        Not really a fan of the rebirth of the "vocoder genre" that seems to be on radio right. Slightly bored with it all.    Talk about over exposure even singers that can sing seem to be using it WTF???   With the music industry being so fickle i wouldn't say you would hit big with this track as I didn't feel there was anything "special". The funny thing is attach a well known name artst, producer etc etc  and people change there minds quick.........  Strange but true ..|`|hJP9y6kjaa	I agree - the vocals are way, way too hot. Your bandmates are idiots. Next time go to the engineer (or an objective third-party who has "the ear") and have them side with you.    If you want vocals to pop, then use some parallel compression - 2:1 ratio or so, something pulling a good 5-7 db off the signal, then blend some of the dry signal back in. You don't need to have the level that high.    I do feel that this track is horribly generic. It sounds like someone listened to the popular rnb/rap tracks on the radio right now, ripped off the lyrics, and put them to a slightly different beat/hook. Why, dear lord, do I have to suffer through another person vocoding/autotuning their way through another song about their "shawty"?    So from a musical perspective its not produced horribly (except for the vocal level) and it sounds okay, but its not exactly what you would call "original".    But hey - if you're having fun and it gets you laid, then well, does it really matter?  *grin*        Saul|`|XOnk1rBcaa	Crap. Don't advertise on here.|`|Lw8xgFKIaa	I'm Not a fan of that type of music but a must say it was pretty cool stuff. I really like the effects and drums put on it.

I have been running a shop 10 years and I find the whinning hourly punks to be the worst part of the Job. I hate when the Union comes in and cost me production, and end up costing 25% of the workers the jobs they depend on for life. The whole "union" thing, taking money and giving nothing to the hourly employees, that should get you steamed.
MfcTIdlraa	Yes, about 45 years ago.  It was gross, but I learned a bunch of stuff that I wouldn't have known without the experience.    Your Bio teacher just wanted you do know about simple anatomy.    Nasty stuff happens.  I guess you don't want to be a doctor!|`|kA7GEKf7aa	I dissected every kind of animal up to a fetal pig. You get used to it and if you're planning on becoming a doctor like me, it's very useful. Of course the insides of a human are different but it's still helpful and sort of like a building block so that when you eventually have to look at the insides of a human, you know where everything is and what you have to do. Plus, people who want to become vets have to dissect animals so that they will be able to save living ones. It sounds cruel, but it's how lives get saved.|`|oQrnizuwaa	i did in seventh grade and i thought it was awesome...not in the creepy way but in the "i learned a lot" way.   it was sooo cool.|`|PSk0zY5uaa	no :'(    ive always wanted to do that.|`|XCn2dK1laa	I dissected frogs,crawdads,a shark,a cat,and a starfish for my zoology class.it was AWESOME!|`|nDQOwAA3aa	i just left killing and cutting up small animals is a sign of a serial killer|`|JSl1jAPQaa	yes, and I hated it too!   ewwww...never again!|`|OXSOch9Oaa	No, I was 'sick' that day.  I purposefully didn't go to the school I wanted to go to until sixth grade because of their 4th and 5th grade dissections.  I hated the very thought of it and couldn't stand it at all.  By the time I was in 6th grade, they had a computer simulation we could use if we wanted to.  But I just faked sick that day and my mom didn't ask why.|`|odQewFgvaa	Yeah, its pretty gross. It makes me sad. I had to drop out of anatomy in college because they dissect cats. (well that and I decided I no longer wanted to be in the medical field)|`|mpOGnr6vaa	Yes, I'm studying biology in college. It's educational, so I accept it.|`|G4zzGaZ9aa	ive never dissected a frog but in march in my bio class we have to disect fetal pigs! ewww! im not looking forward to that at all!|`|IqNLR5BBaa	Yes, I went to private school and dissected a frog, a fish, and an earthworm.  I was lucky. Most public schools make you dissect a pig!  It was ok though. The stuff had been dead a while and was in some sort of solution to preserve them.  I'd been devastated I had to dissect a cat!|`|b48oRznUaa	no, we had a cows heart to dissect and i hated it,|`|bSqzbDPFaa	yeah a frog a worm and a creyfish    i never made it to biology 3 if i did i woulda got to dissect a cat|`|Dl1J1Y9Haa	no  i wanted to do it to but i was in home school for high school|`|nzPZYgY6aa	yess, frog and starfish.|`|dsDxmuLaaa	yeah  i did  its yucky at the first but its enjoyable at the end!|`|xFXgkA95aa	Yup, it is eerie.|`|zY64xc6xaa	Yeah.  Yecccch.|`|FYNXch4faa	Nope|`|wvPwc4PGaa	yeah i have and a pair of pig lungs and a heart|`|OqCdLPfkaa	No! I really wanted to but we didn't!! I hope I get to do it in High School!|`|Ii8h0mgkaa	Ugh.   I can't even THINK about doing such a thing!|`|679b6c2e3d98d5af9b9c37cd3490d71daa	no that's cruel to animals|`|cUbHDRspaa	No but in 5th grade i disected an owl pellet|`|VWXXmL74aa	Yup it was pretty cool once I got over the gagging|`|e31f5810711eb27d4f83df3727aeb40aaa	no never did|`|MI3r3jWeaa	Nope but did a rainbow trout, a Bulls eye and a cows liver. It was horrible.|`|kfuA1RBoaa	Yes, its lame|`|rCfHQ2oXaa	yes, and also a cat in college|`|CQUuCpTQaa	No! But i've watched it done. I almost fainted :(|`|fFozC75naa	Yes & I thought it was gross!!! Blahhh|`|8hvVvzIJaa	yes and the frog had another frog in its belly who has a fishhead in his..it was pretty weird|`|AA11523465	Strangely, we had starfish.  Small school, small budget, I guess.  The smell was the worst.|`|2DVr4C5Baa	yep. and we also dissected a pig!|`|SHkBWCOvaa	Dissections have a funky smell to it.  You get to see the body parts of dead animals. The frog has a lot of  liquid fluids inside it. Sometimes it squirts out. The teeth are really  pointy and the body parts are scary.|`|EDwlTWLwaa	yeah i have dissected a lot of things for school. it's not that bad when it's something small like a frog as long as it's been preserved properly, especially if you have a lab partner to help you. i didn't really enjoy it but it was interesting.|`|Hze3daQXaa	not at school, only in fishing trips. but i disected a white bunny at school :)|`|fZmvWv7qaa	maybe if I did it in a biology class, my parents wouldn't have sent me to a shrink|`|vqZ2XLf6aa	yep. not in a lesson or anything, in the playing fields for a laugh.|`|893687c84192db8afc5ff77206f27a2faa	back in the 50's my mom refused to do it and when i was in high school in the 80's i also refused to do it. my mom understood.i think its wrong to kill anything living just for this purpose.|`|yLa0PVqUaa	I have dissected a baby shark in 8th grade and a frog in 11th grade and they were both DISGUSTING!|`|z0orV2ywaa	Yeah. I didn't learn anything from it, either. I didn't have a problem, although as it was Jr High we all complained about having to do it and how it was wrong even though we really didn't have a problem with it.     These days I REALLY don't think it is right to kill other living creatures just to learn how they work, even a frog. Plus, seeing as I learned nothing from doing it myself, it also seems like a big waste of time.     What if frogs came to be Intelligent and wanted to do dissections of people? I'm sure everyone can agree it would be a bad thing, so why is it okay to dissect a frog?|`|jKK4gJNMaa	well..  the smell of the frog especially the formalin was irritating..  but thats it dissecting it was pretty easy.|`|AqNP2GkCaa	yes yes yes. one of the best lab lessons EVER!|`|VELnLnIKaa	and a pregnant grasshoper and a sheeps eye  and next month a fetal pig   i love it but im pre med lol|`|jaAolejUaa	unformtunately, there were frog shortage in our place when i was studying biology, so was not able to experience it, i want to though...|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	nope my school never did that stuff, always seen it on TV though|`|M3maZgdyaa	After I urped on the teacher she said I didn't have to be in the class room during this time and gave me a B because I tried. LOL|`|shaO0coWaa	Nope and I'm glad I didn't|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	yeah,it was o.k.  the smell was the worst|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Yes I have it sucks man.|`|Lsz5Nqw7aa	i didn't think people really did that... id hate to have to do that, i wud probably refuse to be honest...|`|FXnHE7mmaa	Yes..a frog, a worm, and a baby pig...interesting!|`|MBknatYtaa	No, for some reason they didn't do that in any Bio class I ever took.|`|ERgL2Dhpaa	yes, and a cat, and pig intestines and lungs, and oh yeah, a freaking cadaver!!    anatomy is a cruel cruel class haha|`|rC7YIughaa	no but i dissected a squid.  blaaahh

I just believe in them because I have felt their presence at times and its unexplainable.|`|MNRRpYgLaa	yes, I find them very scary...|`|EJA5tpxpaa	yes.|`|2DVr4C5Baa	nope, i dont believe in ghosts|`|VLw7P5Scaa	why worry about them when we already living our entire life with one .  THE WIFE.|`|bIp7m1qMaa	No its all utter rubbish -  with exception of that little girl ghost that sometimes come into my room at night and stands over my bed.|`|I6lFl5ltaa	yes, very much so!!!   i have a spirit that follows me everywhere i go.  i see and feel them around me all the time. i love to watch the "ghost hunting" shows, some are dumb as bricks but, most are pretty cool!  my husband and i are always seeing things moving, nothing big just slight movements and  hearing footsteps. my dog will get up out of a sound sleep and start looking towards the bedroom,he does not growl or act scared, he just watches and the tip of his tail wags a bit like he wants to go check it out . he does that anywhere from a couple minutes to 15 minutes he then goes running into the bedroom , jumps on the bed and starts to play with 'someone'.  i used to think he was playing with his reflection in the mirror but, i took it out of the room!|`|sDCgltcoaa	i  hav  never  seen|`|EtUTVc6xaa	hell no.|`|j6RbKNmjaa	I don't|`|4qT0TfMZaa	No, and I do not need proof.|`|88uIjItaaa	Yes I Believe in them.  I would love to see one|`|7f2GSDmqaa	no|`|FgU7wYDSaa	yes     sometimes I hear the noise when you sign into an account on your computer in my basement WHEN NO ONE IS THERE!     and once I was playing a game with my brother and he went to the washroom so I felt like unpausing it and his character starting MOVING all by itself.

I'm scared|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Yes I believe in ghost and the paranormal.|`|elECfJ52aa	I do|`|IHa6FxE6aa	No.|`|xwEEfzY7aa	Yes and I have one in my house.............|`|KFu7596Paa	yes anything is posible|`|rC7YIughaa	yes this one time i turned the light off in our garage and i checked it a few minutes later and it turned on. i turned it off again and then it turned back on. finally i said "ok im not playing! just keep the light off!!" and it stayed off!!  freaky huh?|`|CfWXgwxBaa	As agnostic and natural skeptic,I don`t.But yet again, I keep my mind open to all possibilties.If you invite me to your place and I witness something classified as paranormal and not being able to be explained in rational terms,then maybe .................    If ghosts really exists and that we could prove it,that would be truly significant,because that would prove that ,not only there is life after death,but also that hell and Earth are truly one and the same...|`|mpOGnr6vaa	There are no ghosts. Some of our saints said that dead people stay in their graves until Judgment Day. Educated Catholics like me thus know there are no ghosts. Normal things can look strange at night, and if you're too scared to check them closer, you can say that a picture on a wall is a ghost. One of my contacts reported such an incident. His brother said he saw many ghosts, but my contact checked them closer, instead of running, and learned what they really were.|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	yes, when I was a 12, my dad died and a week later, my sister and I were home alone and we were sitting on a love seat couch and all of a sudden it moved backwards and we jumped and we were scared out of our minds because at the time my family didn't believe in ghost, when my Mom came home we told her what happen so to calm us down , we put on the TV and a cross came up on the screen and a few mins later, it said "D: my Dads name begins with a "D" plus "D" in Dad so yes I do believe in ghost, even now I feel like someone is sitting on the edge of my bed.|`|xYLnLCVVaa	yes, i believe in ghosts. i have never seen one though.|`|v2CmpNLAaa	Sure...it's a dimensional thing|`|WKcJE9bKaa	maybe, maybe not.|`|AA11983575	NO I DO NOT BELIEVE IN GHOSTS.

I'll scare you tonight as a proof.|`|b2b33aea4f54d6afe314e900906e0e22aa	No, I don't believe in ghosts, but try to tell me that when I am alone in the dark! LOL|`|mLw7RwEIaa	NO NO NO NO WAY I DONT KNOW WHY PEOPLE BELEAVE IN THEM ERRRRRR NO|`|m5ViQJPeaa	No, but actually I've been seeing and hearing umm.. safe to say, "something". All Carpenter that have built are house are dead and my two unborn and secretly siblings are dead leaving me the only me who survived (though I have 2 half sister and brother). The "secretly" thing about my dead siblings, is that my parents didn't let me know about it and about my father being my mother's second husband. If they are true, I'm not gonna be scared because I know They'll be guiding me:) If they are true..   It's 10:55 PM here

QEEweJUaaa	Your vocal chords are a precious gift, which you want to ensure, is well taken care of, especially if you use your vocal chords to earn your living. There are a variety of exercises you can try that will be beneficial in strengthening your vocal chords. Those who have thinner vocal chords, and so a higher singing voice, should understand that it's the ease at which they vibrate that makes the sound like that. If on the other hand you have thicker heavier vocal chords, they will not vibrate so easily and thereof the sound made will be lower but richer. There is nothing that can be done to make your vocal chords one size or the other.     What kind of exercises can be used to benefit your vocal chords? What you need to do to improve your voice, be it for singing or speaking, is to do stretching exercises. These exercises are done to improve the strength of the vibration made when you are ready to sing or speak. The more you are able to stretch the vocal chords, the tighter you make them with the exercises you use, the more powerful will be the sound you make.     Many music students believe that best exercises for your voice is the simple act of practicing singing. They think that is all that is needed to strengthen their vocal cords and improve their vocal range. Many disagree with this theory.     One of the key exercises for your vocal chords is how to use the air you breathe in to make the sounds you require for singing. Singers need to find exercises to learn to use less air. It's important to balance how much air you need, which is dependent on what sounds you want to make. The more you learn about controlling the vibration of your vocal chords, the more your range will improve.|`|3ozaCLYqaa	We do some pretty funny things in my choir, but they really seem to help.  One thing we do is press down as hard as we can on the back of a chair while singing -  this creates a lot of tension in the diaphragm and helps us to control our breathing.  Another thing that we do is sing while lying on the ground.  If you are lacking energy, you can try bouncing up and down on the balls of your feet, but make sure that your entire foot doesn't come off the ground, just the back.  If you need to raise your soft pallet more, you can stick your tongue as far back on the roof of your mouth as you can and rapidly move your lower jaw up and down.      I know it all sounds really crazy and pointless, but believe me, the change in the quality of sound that is produced is amazing.|`|AA10316420	When singing you not only want to strengthen your vocal abilities you also want to strengthen your diaphragm. We would sing the scales in school and there were times when we would hold a note and gently push on our diaphragms to try to keep the note steady.  When an illness is affecting your vocal cords, Lemon-zinc lozenges help alot.  We would sing little ditty songs like Bumble bee and La Bay.  It is sort of sung like stair steps of the scales. up down up down etc.  hard to explain better if listened to. sorry

bQ5ae7GCaa	Sadly, Punch and Judy's relationship took a turn for the worse. Judy was photographed in the National Enquirer kissing and partying with Howdy Doody, while Punch ended up in drug rehab for an addiction to sniffing wood glue. They tried to keep it together for the sake of the kids, but when Punch took a drill to Judy and ended up in jail for domestic abuse, they called it quits. I believe the divorce was finalized on December 2008. They have joint custody of the termites.|`|XOnk1rBcaa	Judy's a judge on American TV with a stupid punch line.|`|96e31ceb1fe7561cc98bdbb17b080483aa	They returned to the UK where they were always welcomed.|`|fcrFlFZQaa	Mr. Punch knocked that b***h out then killed himself    "That's the way to do it!!"

lGdzb8aqaa	When Brad was going to help Noah you could hear the ice cracking, meaning he most likely fell in after getting Noah out. I think they will find his car and start searching, once Sharon tells how he came to see her. I think they will find his body maybe in the spring- leaving it open for DD to come back.... It could be someone elses body, after all this is a soap  I wonder how Victor is going to feel when he learns Brad saved his grandsons life|`|6KYrjKysaa	im not sure why......but i heard that he is definetly leavinig the show|`|b9329e3a8c7bede831cdbbf754a903b3aa	respect i'm an old school y/r fan yes he should die but what about philis the ***** must go she's worst has tina and nick looking @ one another like you know if it wasn't because of you i would be with the woman i love. But let us lay off of that for a sec what's the deal with Ms. Chansler|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I had heard two things about Brad, either he is just going to turn up missing or he is going to get shot and they are going to make Phylis the prime suspect.|`|ow1m3c8jaa	They are many spoilers/rumors going around that say Brad is supposed to get shot trying to protect Sharon from a bullet that was aimed at her.    Recently though, there are other rumors saying that Brad may drown trying to save Noah after he's fallen in the water while trying to teach Eden how to skate and the ice cracks.    Whatever it is that happens, it's supposed to be aired (in the US it least) on Feb. the 4th so be sure not to miss it.|`|OcCG1pruaa	No one really knows how and why he will be killed off the show, but what i do know, is that his time is coming soon, for him to depart, its just sad though, my speculation on the matter is that he will either get into an accident, that will cause his death,OR he will drown while trying to help Noah in that icy pond!|`|q6ogfhnMaa	too much speculation going on, on Y!A's here, one min i'm hearing that he will die in an accident, the next i'm hearing that he will drown, or get shot by Phyllis, its all speculating IMO, so all we got to do is wait and see hun!|`|uUzbqGh5aa	All l heard was that he's supposed to take a bullet meant for Sharon.|`|AA11369432	There is really no telling I have heard several  endings  for him. I hate to see him go. Though he is not one of my favorites right now.|`|aLIVdFtoaa	I heard he gets shot    but, I'm wondering if he drowns trying to save Noah?    http://soaps.com/youngandrestless/spoile... spoilers in the link    EDIT:  (Saturday).........I was right, looks like he drowned!!|`|uGFzzLYWaa	I heard they were killing him off.  The reason is that the show cannot afford to keep him.  There are a lot of long time stars that are getting the axe due to budget and fiscal problems. (such as Deidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn from "Days of Our Lives)  I heard that daytime drama ratings are tanking hardcore, and there are a few that may not even surive the next year or so.  It looks like this may be the beginning of the end of an era.|`|YIAVYlTYaa	yeah i heard that he is going to get shot and that he is going to turn up missing at the end of this week. his last air date is next thursday so maybe he'll be missing for a couple days and than get shot? i really want to know how this is going to turn out!

Wasn't she a prostitute once?    I'm saying all this and i haven't actually seen it lately, so my guess is a total stab in the dark!!|`|dd1c4772483cf17b8d588eaddff60b28aa	No, I don't think it is Nick- not his sort of thing.    I have always thought it to be Archie - when Peggy wanted to start a protest against the place, he was not for it at all and said that she would be ruining someone's living.    Don't trust him, never have done and never will!!  He makes me cringe!|`|t2KJijUpaa	I think its Archie, because he acted very suspicious when peggy wanted to close it down he was like leave it alone..

My friend "I was taught to be a jew and I like it because it gives me a sense of community"- That I will tolerate, because it is sensible and she has a right to her opinion.     Ex gf: "Jesus is REAL" I will ignore that, because it is not offensive and doesn't mean anything to me.|`|khnMoQNoaa	involuntary limb movement   just creeps me out|`|64f66662454c0ed446e32154c55e475aaa	racism, bigotry and hypocrisy    and never tolerate it|`|rpqHLJGGaa	Ignorance and i love a challenge|`|OqCdLPfkaa	Telling my I am blushing.

I try to ignore it, and get out of talking to them as quickly as possible but it basically makes me want to rip it out through a puckered orifice.|`|t0KTJr8xaa	When I go out with my friends, and they try to set me up with someone just because I don't have a boyfriend...

When people get drunk for the sake of getting drunk, or (worse) when they pretend to be drunk...  That stuff's just rude and I don't ignore it or tolerate it... Sometimes I challenge it, but more often I just cut those particular people loose, because I just don't have time for any bull.

oTf255Lsaa	I think it's this new band called Hat Violence. They're meant to be really good, should be a good gig :D|`|i2ZAVM2aaa	The Turnips|`|AA12303060	I seen her in concert in Novemeber last year.

3WItFAwlaa	Yes, of course.  Go see her.  Remember to bring condoms.      Astro.com's interpretations are lifted directly (word for word) from books by Robert Hand.  Buy Planets in Transit and Planets in Composite to get the same information.  I am amazed that people actually pay for their interpretations year after year instead of just buying the books and an ephemeris.  The dailies are free but some people pay for extended.    *Days of Rain- It is under "forecast" under "extended chart selection".|`|B7WIZdglaa	where on astro do you go where it gives you this info??

In this state, they are highly capricious about who they flirt with and the repercussions of their flirtatious behavior. It is known to some to even be destructive. Her interest in you may either be nonexistent, or very short lived. In addition, compatibility between these two signs is horrible. Leo and Capricorn are both particularly bossy signs who prefer to be in charge. There will be a lot of head butting going on in such a relationship, and in most cases it will fail miserably by the time the Capricorn's strict side shows itself, and the Leo's freedom-loving side comes around.    Do not waste your time on this when there are better matches out there.

qiyLq6CRaa	Josh Ford is a fictional character in The WB series Popular. He was portrayed by Bryce Johnson. Josh is one of the male lead characters, the other being, Harrison John.
HeZorcNWaa	I've read the answers so far...pretty hostile, but I can see why.    That said, however many people have died in any amount of time, I believe it is ok to celebrate the life of one, five...a thousand of them.     I think what happened to Gia Carangi was tragic, horribly tragic.    I first got told about her when I was actively using heroin. I'd been told a lot of stories about famous addicts and their lives, their deaths...their troubles. I'd seen hundreds of documentaries and films about heroin. None of them bothered me. Yeah, I was a junkie too, but that was as far as the similarities went. But when I read about Gia Carangi...I was terrified. Someone gave me the movie 'Gia' and I watched it. It wasn't like I could relate to Angelina's portrail of her...my life was very far from the one portrayed, but I still felt so shocked, so scared by it.     Aids is a horrific way to die. I'd rather be burned alive...its a quicker death.     I know 'she brought it on herself' through drug use, but that doesn't mean she didn't hurt, that she wasn't human and she would've known, deep down, what she'd done to herself...her family. She essentially killed herself through trying to find a way to cope with life. It is sad.    Fifty thousand people can die in a war and it doesn't make Gia Carangi's story any less tragic. I lost two friends specifically to heroin. I'm heart broken when I watch the news and see all the death in the world, the poverty, the cruelty, but that doesn't mean I dont hurt for my mates either.     Every life matters to someone.|`|rDs2e1Nhaa	What ever! got my own problems to deal with.|`|AA11169105	As sad as it is for anyone to die, i would prefer to remember people who didnt bring it on themselves.|`|T0biNswsaa	1200 Palestinians died because it's an election year in Israel, the BBC didn't give a **** about that so no, don't care in the slightest.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	I think we're going to see more movies like Seabiscuit (2003) and Cinderella Man (2005). Both of these movies depict the underdog coming from behind to win the championship. From an inauspicious start, the real race horse, Seabiscuit, became an unlikely champion and a symbol of hope to many US citizens during the Great Depression. The same holds true for the 1930's boxer Jim Braddock (played by Russell Crowe).   As for the recession that we now find ourselves in, people who have lost their jobs, their homes, and their self-respect are going to want to be inspired to keep their chins up.  Too, comedies will offer a temporary fix. Everyone needs a good laugh to feel better and forget their troubles.|`|MBknatYtaa	I think you may see some more comedies both in the movies and on TV.

xYLnLCVVaa	yahoo music, and you can look at similar bands to the one you choose. sort of like the guy above me, i just use yahoo.|`|QgxZOI4Iaa	Okayy! here's how I find new music:     there are quite a few ways:     go to google, and search for things like: similar artists to _____ (Jack Off Jill) you'll get like 3 or 4 bands when you finish your whole search and listen to the music and like/dislike the bands you've found.    go to myspace.com then go to the music section, scroll down til the end of the page and look for the Top Genres thingie, you'll see Rap, Hip-Hop.. etc, what you want is Alternative, those bands are not all alternative, some are Metal, Grunge.. check all of the Rock genres out, like see, Altern., Metal, Grunge, Punk..     go to last.fm and search for any of the artists, you'll see a link to a page, click on it, then you'll see like mini-biography about the band, go to similar artists on the left, you'll get plenty of bands, and they give you a little compatibility meter or whatever that says: Highly Similar or Very Highly Similar..     go to musicmesh.net, it's a good site I think..     try westsounds.com too :)     those are what I use and I have a pretty big list of songs that makes up 85% of my life. lol.     you should also listen carefully to the bands you find, cause it's hard to accept new bands and new music, not all bands have the same sound.     enjoy! :)|`|cVqCryr6aa	Try looking in dumpsters at night.|`|mLw7RwEIaa	You tube :D hope this helped :D|`|AA11103493	Try myspace|`|XadHhxOSaa	yea simple,    go to www.last.fm type in the band you like most, then you click on the "similar artists" button and it will show u all the artists that are like that one :)

fH6JbBhSaa	Ranges from $100-$xxxxxxx depends on how big, what kind and many other features. Simply go to Wal-Mart if you want a cheap one|`|QOITXwDIaa	if you mean an actual wedding band for your finger, you can pick one up fairly cheap if quality doesn't matter - check out ebay and even Kmart or Walmart    if you mean people to come play music, place an ad on Criagslist specifying what kind of music you want played (www.craigslist.org) and go listen to different local band practice to see who you like or go to local bars and ask a good cover band how much they would charge.  There are a lot of bands who will do it pretty cheap just to get their names out there.  Tell them they can put up a banner with their name on it and they can put out business cards for people to take.  Free advertising is worth a lot!|`|5385f45a70dcab7bbb5e7da5f3034aeeaa	Really depends how much are you going to dish out.    I seen some range from $15 AUD on special  to $500 AUD with diamonds or white gold types    Im sure round your part of the woods would have the same, just ask your local jeweller... oh and one hint dont ask first, walk in and check out the prices because some shops will charge you much much more for the same thing hundreds of dollars cheaper than a shop that may be closeby.    If the items seem to cost a lot in that jeweller walk out and do not let their sales skills get the better of you into buying something too expensive.     Note down the prices in each local Jeweller  Find the cheapest and specific ring you are after  Negotiate if necessary    and hope your other half loves it    Best of luck|`|aOjMf5SPaa	about 200-300. so about $400. Thats for an 18carot gold band. If you want a cheap one, look second hand or go to a commercial jewellers.   We actually got ours at the last minute from a silversmith for 15 each. And they are great!!|`|vO4uvoYBaa	it depends, i paid 850 for my wedding band then lost it in va. beach|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	not much its really just symbolic, I used a aluminum can pop top|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	any where from $75 up.  depends if you just want a thin gold band or more elaborate.|`|AA10496601	for a guy or girl?

sjD26raeaa	10/23/09 and my duaghter is so stoked! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirque_du_F...  Cirque du Freak is the film adaptation of the first three books of the book series, The Saga of Darren Shan, by author Darren Shan. The movie began filming on February 18, 2008 in New Orleans and ended June 3rd, 2008.[1] The film is distributed by Universal Pictures. Some of the movie was filmed on a set constructed within New Orleans City Park, approximately 1000 feet off of the side of the road, along Harrison Avenue.    Production  Cirque du Freak will be shot in New Orleans, the village of Folsom and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Some of the characters required a great deal of prosthetics and makeup led by Steve Koch, Brian Sipe and Mark Garbarino. Prosthetics did not quite add the height needed on certain shots for the character of Mr. Tall played by Academy Award-nominated Ken Watanabe [7]. Although Watanabes height of 6ft is tall a body double was cast for certain shots. Trevon Flores, a local basketball player, stands at 6-foot-10, 210-pounds and was used for certain shots to show the abnormal height of Mr. Tall. Additionally Ken Watanabe utilized in Pre-Production and Production, Dialogue coaches Kathleen S Dunn and Francie Brown respectfully to further enhance his performance as the circus barker. [8] The filmmakers will be taking advantage of computer-generated imagery to portray other fantasy elements.    Recently, John Marshall High School (Los Angeles) was used to film a few parts of the movie.    release dates depending on where you live  Belgium  19 August 2009    France  19 August 2009    Netherlands  27 August 2009    Norway  25 September 2009    Brazil  2 October 2009    Denmark  2 October 2009    Germany  15 October 2009    Sweden  23 October 2009    UK  23 October 2009    USA  23 October 2009    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450405/rele...|`|iQAGeVjsaa	10/23/09    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450405/

OTxCCXa5aa	The sad fact is that for people like Paris Hilton, The money won't run out. Hilton are daddies massive chain of luxury hotels and a slight dwindle in business won't put much of a mark on them. Sure there's gonna be a few years of recession but it won't last forever and even during that period they'll still have business. Just because people aren't going on hoiday as much doesn't mean theyre not going at all, and remember lots of their customers are business people who's companies pay for them to be there, there's still people with money who want to spend it, still companies earning big bucks, still rich people getting married, still loaded people who want to relax. So, for the Hiltons, there won't be any loss. Paris has also turned herself into a franchise, she has a new TV show in the U.K., perfume ranges, books, probably clothing lines and people still buy this stuff. Its just recession, it won't last forever and its not the end of te world. For most of these 'Paris' types, things will be fine, they won't notice these kinds of hardships the way the little guys will, its a shame really and it seems unfair but its true.|`|BzUMSGgwaa	Their money will never run out..its theirs, their fathers etc have invested in it for them and they are basically living on interest.

Apparently, reptiles were laying eggs thousands of years before chickens ever appeared. What happened was that one day(a long time ago) an egg that was not quite a chicken's egg was laid by a bird that was not quite a chicken. Evolution took on from there.|`|AA11475052	Why did the chicken cross the playground?

Vin Diesel as Taylor says: "500 fights, that's the number I figured when I was a kid. 500 street fights and you could consider yourself a legitimate tough guy. You need them for experience. To develop leather skin. So I got started. Of course along the way you stop thinking about being tough and all that. It stops being the point. You get past the silliness of it all. But then, after, you realize that's what you are."|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Knockaround Guys with Vin Diesel? and I think it was 500 fights...|`|zYGJh5Odaa	what in the hell r u talking about.|`|d0e1b5b2af884d02c8c1a86fcdf900caaa	Fight Club?|`|lJZNGsZCaa	The fighting part sounds like fight club, not sure about the money part.|`|oEe2Rdifaa	more details plz|`|xbQMBuomaa	Sounds like Ice Harvest|`|AA12386598	Could be "Knockaround Guys".|`|deef1c58e30ca2ffd3431e69449badd1aa	Sounds like Knockaround guys to me.

noiX4SpTaa	Miss America is a separate pageant entity. Women compete on a local level (i.e., Miss Chicago). The winner of the local pageant goes on to compete at the state level (i.e., Miss Illinois). The winner of the state level goes on to compete at Miss America.  Within the Miss America Organization, the "highest" pageant to compete at is Miss America. Miss America does not go on to compete at any other pageants as Miss America.    Miss USA is associated with Miss Universe as they are both part of the Miss Universe Organization. The winners of local state pageants (anyone can enter) go on to compete at Miss USA. The winner of Miss USA goes on and competes at Miss Universe with winners of other countires. Miss Universe is the "highest" pageant in this sytem.    Miss World is another completely different pageant system, the Miss World Organization. I'm not exactly sure how you get to the state level at Miss World, but the winner of Miss World United States goes on to compete at Miss World.|`|LLgeriMtaa	miss universe as the name implies; encompasses more participating countries than miss world

The studio and the fans were so disappointed after Ang Lee's version, they decided to revamp the whole thing.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	Remake. You lose.|`|K28Qo2ZVaa	remake.  and a much better one that the one from a few years ago, The Hulk.|`|ZhIVvlLPaa	... it is a remake...|`|iQAGeVjsaa	Its  remake lol my friends and i were talking about that when it came out, the first one that came out was so bad, they just decided to fire everyone involved with that one and start over.|`|8OREBeRdaa	Sorry pal it's a remake.  Think of all the crummy things about the 1st one:  1) Bad script  2) Eric Bana as Bruce Banner?  Not believable.  3) The same thing goes for Jennifer Connoly as Betty?  4) Did Bruce's dad turn into zzaax at the end?  I'm still not sure.    The latest one had an interesting twist.  When they gave the script to Edward Norton to read over, he gave it back a bit later with a whole bunch of changes.  He said that if they didn't keep to the changes then he wouldn't do the movie.  Ok, sure that's kind of snobby and self-righteous but he does pick and choose his roles.  He's actually a freaking genius.  I was genuinely surprised that he would take on this role.  I thought it was a better Hulk movie...well as far as Hulk movies go at any rate.
B365rHNAaa	I loved the first 3 and the rest of them just weren't funny at all.  if you go onto his imdb, you'll see how many movies he's starring in next and it's ridiculous.

oQrnizuwaa	last year in an mock interview for a CHURCH position my question was "what do you want to do with your life?" i was GOING to say "i just want to have success." that's not what came out.... i said "i just want to have some sex"   everyone laughed at me   and i was embarrased. :P  but it sure was funny :)|`|VWXXmL74aa	Ripping my pants while bowling. Oh ripping them in the butt part incase you didn't catch the embarrassing part|`|gSwobfujaa	uh ha! i actually have an answer for this question this time. i used to not be able to recall one but now there is a fresh incident that just occured this past weekend.    so im at this babyshower for a good friend from high school. i didnt know anyone there but her. not that this matters, but for effect only, i was the only white person there. SO all of the food is brought out and everyone is eyein it...talking about who is gona get up first. im sitting in the corner BY MYSELF bc i dont know anyone there and the mom to be was obviously busy. so they get up...thank everyonw for coming and say "please, everyone have something to eat. so who wants to get started?" and my dumba** decides i should try to be funny. so i get up and say "alright!! ill do it!" thinking ill be the first to grab a plate. well i get up and no one else follows. but they are all staring at me. i look over at my friend and shes in shock. about 5 seconds goes by (felt like 20 minutes) and i ask her "what am i starting?" she says reluctantly..... "prayer...........?" i was like oh god, no no i cant...ill sit back down. and everyone laughed. i was so embarassed bc 1.) im not religious 2.) yeah right like im gona say prayer 3.) im not even good at public speaking it was quite amusing but it lightened things up being teased by strangers for the remainder of the time i was there!|`|XXZFf1AYaa	I was in middle school, and I was being tested with high schoolers in another city (some academic program) and during the test I had to pee. Well, I held it and the test ended up being like 20 pages long and I didn't know if I was allowed to get up so I kept holding it. Towards the end of the test, I ended up peeing in my pants. I was so embarrassed, no one said anything, but someone had to have noticed when I was walking outside.    Another time, 2 years ago, my *new* at the time boyfriend was watching the game in the downstairs living room, and while I was walking down the stairs (in new socks) towards him, my foot slipped out from under me and I went bouncing down the stairs on my butt. Lol, he didn't even look up, I had to tell him what happened!|`|FgU7wYDSaa	I can't tell you cuz its embarrassing|`|JLayHNZCaa	When Dub got reelected, I was so embarassed for our country, it really made me sad.

QsQj8jO7aa	1. work on bringing more body into the voice. Learn to sing with a good full tone that projects. Right now the singer sounds a bit timid. I also noticed some clashing notes. Notes that were not on pitch, I don't mean out of tune, just not on pitch. Working on your ear would help that.  2. the piano playing was the best part of the recording.  3.Don't know about accents.|`|DAHBUvtLaa	It sounds like if someone wants to sing they  should take vocal lessons or never sing again.  the piano play was mediocre. but not horrible.|`|AA10225723	I really liked your voice a lot. You have a great tone and  I could understand you. The only critique I have is that on the really low notes, you went flat. But I think with a little training, you could easily overcome that. As far as accent, it sounds like Filipino?   As far as the piano is considered, I was too focused on the voice to even notice it. Which is probably a good thing.

gb9REJN4aa	Oddly, arguably the Twilight movie is about just this theme. I haven't seen it and have no desire to (and find the whole "Twilight" phenomenon just plain weird), but by way of metaphor it's about two young adults who think they're in love, who find each other incredibly attractive, etc, but who cannot or will not consummate that love. Now, yes, they're largely talking about kissing, and yes, that's apparently because he might just find himself too tempted by the smell of her blood (I told you this was a weird, weird phenomenon), but I wonder if the metaphor doesn't still stand? There is certainly a notion that self-control is of ultimate importance and is in fact an extremely important part of loving the other person. It could at least provide an interesting entryway into a discussion of chastity and self-control.|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	There are a few with Kirk Cameron that are along those lines,but Hollywood has a pro-teen-sex agenda and they will keep pushing it nonstop even when the films lose money.|`|kLK2peV1aa	LOVE GURU!!!!|`|AA12386598	Not a likely plot.

And yes, there will be another. It is already in development.    Esta Charkham is rumored to play The Penguin.|`|mpOGnr6vaa	That'd be easy, because the reviewers were wrong, as usual about this performance. Jack Nicholson was much better as the Joker in the 1989 film. Even Cesar Romero was better in the campy 1966 movie and earlier TV series.|`|vQeKxmZyaa	Paul Rueben|`|8OREBeRdaa	1) I don't think they should have the Joker in the next Batman movie.  It was Heath's swan song and he put a lot of effort into that role.  He was phenomenal.     2) I don't think Johnny Depp would be a good choice.  I do, however, think that he could make up for that trivial drivel that Jim Carrey did as the Riddler.  He's also supposed to play the Mad Hatter in Tim Burton's Alice so why not have him do the same role in Batman?    I think they need to get Angelina as Catwoman first, before she retires.  It will make up for that horrible movie that Halle Berry did.|`|6rAXlNrIaa	Now if there is another Batman flick they will not put another joker in it... They will just make a story of how/why he never shows up again.|`|mv1CdyEtaa	johnny depp is a good actor  i think he's able to be a good joker  but heath ledger's joker is phenomenal   and i think, they shouldn't cast another joker - just don't have a joker in the next movie|`|bnEQozqZaa	No johhny depp is a very good actor but he wont fit in the role  heath leadger was the best he acted very good in the movie but no one can replace him his acting was WOW!|`|AA11589095	Eddie Murphy

hJP9y6kjaa	In my humble opinion, the fewer the better. It takes a certain degree of logistics, organization, and leadership to keep more and more people together, to quell personal issues, to keep people motivated, etc.    I've played in three, four, and five person bands. Playing in a trio is a lot of fun, but everyone has got to be able to wear multiple hats... the bassist might need to double as vocalist, the guitarist may also need to do keys, etc. Four people is about right - everyone can specialize a little bit, it's the standard configuration.     Going up to five people can allow a lot more of it, but you have to watch out that you aren't trying to cram too much into the space - either sonically or physically... some stages aren't that big, and it can be difficult for five people to cram onto a small stage, with drums, multiple guitar amps, etc!    I will say that playing in the five piece was probably the best-sounding rock band I've played in - we tore it up!    Going forward, I don't think I'll do that again (five people), at least in a "rock band" context. It does give you the chance to hang back a bit and "fill in" the wall of sound, instead of feeling like you have to "be" the wall of sound, but I dunno, it's just a little too much. I like to keep things relatively simple I guess.    I've been (slowly, slowly) working on putting together a trio for a side project. In my mind, it's about ideal - fewer instruments means lower on-stage volume, means less mic bleed (which means thicker, fuller drums!), means less logistics in terms of conflicting schedules for practices or getting gear to shows, etc.    To each his own.... in a more laid-back setting like a worship band or jazz/blues group I wouldn't mind more people, but then again, I associate worship music with pretty simple stuff that you can always get at least someone to sub in on (here's an instrument, play three chords!) and I associate jazz/blues with more mature players who aren't as likely to flake out. (shows how much I know, right? *grin* )      Saul|`|kYYDOJzSaa	It varies.    Some people do the best solo, or with only one other person.  See Beck, or the White Stripes.    If all three are talented, a three piece can be fantastic (drums, bass, guitar/piano) - see Primus, The Reverend Horton Heat, The Bad Plus    Adding more members can be good, as long as they are all willing to work together, rhythm/lead guitar, keyboards, non-instrumental vocalist, etc.    The best band I've ever been in, I played a moog synth along with a drummer, bass player, guitarist, and vocalist.    I've had fun playing guitar/bass in three and four piece bands too though.  Sometimes taking the vocals - but always while playing.|`|o4IHt3EAaa	5  2 guitar player  1 bass guitar  1 drum  1 singer

The farmer is minding his own business and sees the venquilitrist standing watching. The venquilitrist decides to play a joke on the farmer and starts throwing his voice to the cow. First of all, he speaks to the cow.  "How are you today?"  the farmer looks confused as if the man is crazy.   "I'm fine thankyou, just getting my morning meal," the cow replied.  The farmer couldn't believe his eyes and actually believed the cow was speaking.   The farmer then went to feed the pigs and the same thing happened.  "How are you today?" the venquilitrist asked.  "Not bad, just doing my usual thing, lying in the mud," the pig replied.   The farmer then moved onto the sheep. The venquilitrist then spoke to the sheep. "How are you today?"  All of a sudden the farmer jumps in front of the sheep and screams in the venquilitrist's face, "What ever she says, she's f*cking lying!

Guy jumps out with a length of chain, a big *** dog, set of handcuffs and a shotgun.     So of course the owner asks what are you going to do with all that?     Well I'm going to tie the chain to my bumper and the tree. Then you are going to get in the truck and try to rock the tree a little bit while I climb it and try to pry his hand off the branches so he falls. Then this guard dog is trained... As soon as the gorilla falls out of the tree the dog will go for his nuts and hold him down till I get out of the tree, put the handcuffs on him and haul him away.     Ok, so what is the shotgun for?   That's in case I fall out of the tree....   Shoot the dog!|`|6ZmiuwWDaa	Why does the U.S.S. Enterprise hover around Uranus?

SoF1F4uJaa	A little bedtime reading:    Anthony Kiedis told Rolling Stone in an interview published May 20, 2008 that the Red Hot Chili Peppers are "disbanded for the moment." Following the last leg of the tour promoting Stadium Arcadium, the band members have been on a break. Kiedis attributes this to the band being worn out from their years of nonstop work since Californication. Kiedis explained that he is currently preoccupied with taking care of his new son, while Flea is experimenting with new musical ideas, Frusciante is continuing his solo career, and Chad Smith is in Japan working with a jazz band. The band plans to remain on hiatus for "a minimum of one year." However, Kiedis has stated that he is eager to start thinking about new material.    Nevertheless, band members appear divided as to what they want for the future of the band. Although they are heavily rumored to headline the 2009 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April in Indio, California.    According to Smith, the group was to get together to discuss their next album tentatively in September 2008. Smith went on to say that "some of our best stuff is yet to come. For some reason we have a special thing, the four of us. We've changed the chemistry of the band a couple of times. When John [Frusciante] rejoined for the second time, we were like: 'This is a special chemistry we have.'" However, Flea enrolled at USC fall 2008 and stated that the Red Hot Chili Peppers are on a "major hiatus", the duration of which will be "two years". According to Flea, "We just needed two years. We had our noses to the grindstones so hard for so long. We needed to get away from it and get a fresh perspective on things." He also stated that they have no tenth album planned, yet he has also stated that he is very anxious to release more music. In early 2009, Frusciante stated that: "the official news is just that there's no plans to do anything and we're on a hiatus of an indefinite length. There's just absolutely no plans to do anything and, that's it. Yeah, we worked really hard for ten years and, you know, there's other things in life."    The band's newest recording was in 2008 with George Clinton (who also produced 1985's "Freaky Styley") on his latest album "George Clinton and His Gangsters of Love". Accompained by Kim Manning, the band recorded a new version of Shirley and Lee's classic "Let the Good Times Roll".|`|1ibHGaAhaa	Probably Drugs, Sex and Rock and Roll.|`|AIhL8wLkaa	On a hiatus right now...earliest that they will return to the studios is 2010...

As for the song I think "You be the Anchor that Keeps My Feet on the Ground, I'll be the Wings that Keep Your Heart in The Clouds" It's by Mayday Parade. I would also say "Dear Jamie" by Hellogoodbye, but that's from a guy to a girl. Either way check them out and maybe they would work.

DC2TZwXRaa	Has an inner self-confidence which can help them build firm foundations in life and potentially achieve their ambitions.  Sometimes emotionally intense but capable of putting on the charm when they want to.      But tends to feel sorry for themselves, and no-one else can snap them out of that state of mind once they get that way.  Tends to put themself down, and occasionally lacks confidence with their own abilities.    Needs to be given every encouragement to talk, even if it is about big things they want to do in the future, and to realise their true talents.   Needs to avoid drugs & alcohol, and work to meet life's challenges with all they can muster.      Needs to learn responsibility and respond rationally.

jgw1buUAaa	For me, it's a happy feeling. See, i grew up listening to all kinds of music and some of it was barbershop. My dad was always really involved in community theatre and so was i. It was something we could share together. I can't tell you how wonderful it felt to be up on stage with him. A lot of times we would go on long trips driving together and he would pop in an old barbershop tape and we'd sing it together so for me, barbershop brings back VERY happy memories.

ZUkals6laa	This is an unusual, but good question. Well for me, R & B is one of my all-time favorite genres of music, and it serves to pull profound emotional and historical strings inside of me when I listen to it. Given that R & B was born as the offspring of blues and pop in the 1960s, it comes out of a historical moment that celebrated, primarily, the African American tradition of musical progress.  All of these amazing artists that happened to become famous at a relatively similar time created a renaissance of sorts, when you have the likes of the Temptations, Martha & the Vandellas, and Smoky Robinson all playing on the same stage, literally.  Later, the sound evolved into a more political scene, when you had artists like Stevie Wonder and Curtis Mayfield questioning the racial and political tensions of the '70s with the courage that few singers of any genre were willing to project.     However, it is the advancement of R&B into sub-genres such as New Jack Swing and Neo Soul, as found in the '80s and '90s that I draw more of an emotional connection to, in comparison with the music of today.  New Jack Swing gave many artists the chance to mix song sampling of hip hop with the traditional beats of R & B. Some of the artists who demonstrated this style best included Guy and Bell Biv Devoe. The music sounds effortless, and invokes a 'party-time' sentiment about daily living and relationships.  In contrast, Neo Soul has a much heavier sound, with lyrics that often reflect on the pain of undesirable connections with friends, lovers, and the world in general.  For me, it's a style of R & B that invoke a spirit of questioning the world on the way it is, in comparison with how the artist thinks it should be.    I'm sure that was more of an answer than you were looking for, that's what the sounds of R & B bring out in me. :)

If not, then we could laugh together.  If they were hurt, I would do what is necessary to help them.  It is not funny.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	Yes.  I think we all would laugh at the moment.  We should be more sympathetic later.|`|Mrhs7D9daa	eenie MEANie miney mo, id probably laugh while im trying to help him/her and say im sorry while im still laughing|`|YdXhZka8aa	Yes but prior experience tells me that it wouldn't take a second for me to fall and bust my *** in turn.

MsBoH20Iaa	Contact Cort and ask them if you should return it to the store or if you should send it directly to them for replacement or repair. It's obviously a defect in craftsmanship if you only had it for a week and it's cracking already. Don't let the store spin you either. Go directly to the top if you have to.

bribxhsdaa	The "Amen Break" is a beautiful thing musically..but sometimes it makes me wanna punch a nun square in the gums.    These are cool too - I remember researching this same idea the second i started messing with music...    You'll probably know the next ones :     Kool & The Gang - NT.     James Brown - Funky President    Honey Drippers - Impeach The President    Zapp And Rogers - More Bounce To The Ounce    EDIT - Also, As much as it isn't a specific. I hate generic musical ideas....Like really generic trumpet and saxaphone melodies.  Some of them have been over done.  Plus, I think Soul music has had some classic's bastardised due to overdone amounts of "Chipmunk Soul".|`|q4XUy0Duaa	I think this ones been sampled the most:  Zapp & Roger - More Bounce to the Ounce  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvvN1SO3...    Here's just a few songs that have sampled it:  EPMD - You Gots To Chill  Biggie - Goin Back to Cali  Low Profile - Pay Ya Dues  Ice Cube - How to Survive in South Central  Brownside & Eazy E - Eastside Drama  King Tee - Bass  Heavy D & The Boyz - More Bounce  MC Breed & DFC - Aint No Future in Yo' Frontin'  Snoop Dogg - Snoop Bounce  Breeze - L.A. Posse  Coolio - County Line  Paperboy - The Nine Yards  Masta Ace Incorporated - Slaughtahouse  Public Enemy - 1 Million Bottlebags  X-Clan - Heed the Word of the Brotha  Redman - So Ruff  Wu Tang Clan - METHOD Man  Digital Underground - Shake and Bake    I think Ice Cube has sampled it at least 4 or 5 times alone.      In terms of lyrics, I think Rakim and Prodigy of Mobb Deep's lines have been sampled the most.  For example, some lines from Prodigy that I hear used over and over again are "I've fallen and I can't turn back," "the realness," and "there's a war goin' on outside."|`|4hiMgHMCaa	Top billin-Audio Two|`|aJfBtT9iaa	i heard alot of rappers sample phil collins, and cold play.|`|GvUWGMedaa	the most i have heard is "yow check this"|`|VclnZhSCaa	Isaac Hayes    Annoying: Sped up vocals!

He has 19 videos (with more updates), and on each video he'll play 10 songs that have been sampled in hip hop songs. The first 4 videos will be some popular samples, and the rest you'll be in awe.

08H81poqaa	According to Wikipedia, in 1853 H.J. Whitley (the father of Hollywood) was on his honeymoon and he and his wife came up with the name because of the "California Hollies" covering the hillside with their red berries.  Apparently, this has not been confirmed except through Whitley's wife's memoirs.  Makes sense to me and if she wrote this, then it should be considered "confirmed".    Interesting question.

8OREBeRdaa	I think they've already done Freddy vs. Jason so doing Mike Myers vs. Freddy wouldn't be all that great.    Terminator vs. Predator would be an interesting twist.  I think Dark Horse comics has done that crossover right?  What would the motivation be for a Predator to kill different robots?  Perhaps vengeance I guess, if one of their own got killed.

qbSsciwVaa	UH.. u look kinda half awake there. But u don't look that bad maybe a 7 or 8.    EDIT:: People just cuz a person ask how they look or what they would rate them don't mean they are insecure, have a problem, or something it just means that they want other people's opinion just cuz they want it.  It don't mean that it matters or anything it just can mean that they want to know what u think of them.  IT don't ALWAYS have to be for a reason.|`|AA11325161	hey i agree with the fact that you shouldn't really be asking total strangers to rate you but hey since you ask i will give you a 9 out of 10. sure you are a handsome guy|`|QYy0vU4maa	I would give you an 8 or 9 I love your eyes but you should smile!|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	I don't know why you care what we think, but since you asked, I don't like what you're doing with your mouth.

7kvTHzj0aa	torrent is downloading small parts of files from multiple hosts. it sometimes helps the downloader be anonymous.  my opinion is that torrenting is wrong, but i do it anyways. lol   its like downloading music for free.  you will need a torrent downloading program. I use BitTorrent. serch on google.  then, go to any torrent hosting site. becare though. some sites are full of viruses. i trust Isohunt.com the most.|`|u3Md6fsbaa	www.torrentscan.com is a good place to start.

It's still theft, it just doesn't seem like it because it's not physical, only digital. The fact of the matter is that the work you're pirating is owned by someone who is not getting paid when you illegally download it.    You also tend to get much better quality when you buy an official copy. Lots of times you can use software like iTunes to legally download highly discounted CDs. I once spent $4 for a CD on iTunes with 12 tracks.    Besides, the RIAA is out to get young people who illegally download. A free movie or CD is not worth getting sued by RIAA for $20,000.|`|vmlArXqAaa	its really confusing. and you have to have all this stuff..id rather just buy it than go through all that.

NHtnCKiMaa	Joss Whedon creates characters that everyone can relate with.  Each of his characters is a multi-layered character who many times starts off as someone normal thrown into a difficult situation.  Also, they are never perfect - each has their own flaws/weaknesses that they have to overcome amongst all the other drama happening around them.  Just look at Malcolm in Firefly - one could argue he's wannabe Han Solo but you get a season and a movie with him so you get more time to get to know his character stregths and flaws and he's just cool.  Han Solo? 3 movies.  And let's not forget that Whedon also does a great job with action.  How could you NOT love that formula I ask you? You remind me from someone from where I work that likes certain movies/shows but won't give others a try!|`|VoFFpD49aa	Check out Firefly and Serenity. Great TV show....cancelled before it could really find it's place. And the film (also great) was basically a thank you to the fans for all their support of Firefly. But to answer your question, Whedon just has a way w/ dialog that no one else could write... it's sarcastic, smart, cool and at times it makes you do a double take (inside your head) you can't believe the characters just said whatever it was they said...if that makes any sense.|`|361c70be0209ad9c5ef2d3e4577f11e5aa	You fail to mention Buffy and Firefly. All three of these shows were well written multi layered series, and Buffy was a masterpiece. DS9 had it's moments, & Zena doesn't even belong in the conversation.

2e567b74109c5b552ade64ebaf7faf9daa	Ick.    It makes me very glad I have my own car!!    Maybe I can swing by and pick you up on my way home from work...  In fact, I should because you still haven't seen my new to me car!  (If the sun decides to peek out, we can even open the sun roof!)    If for some strange reason I can't make it, if you can afford it, you should call a taxi.   You will probably be just fine with the bus ride and walk, but you won't be super comfortable.    (my jaw hurts today...  but I made it through work last night...)|`|DzIlM76Xaa	Taxi. Although one dentist I visited forbade us from taking a taxi home...|`|k1Aio2qdaa	I could handle the bus....it's not that long....take your IPOD or something...to take your mind off of it|`|AA10506180	I would just call a taxi-why suffer in a bus and then walking as well?|`|XAioHGKbaa	Call a taxi.....good luck and have fun...lol.....just remember to think about a beautiful beach|`|qRKOWgS0aa	Call a taxi babe.

Well, I do not recommend callin a taxi because your mouth will be numb and if you call them after, they will think you are retarded...  Shall I say more?    Plus, you could get some exercize!!  So I say walk....  but if you need to talk, buy small dry erase board and carry it around...|`|AA11305156	Get a friend to pick me up, that's what I would do.|`|WbRuTjmFaa	Sounds gruesome to me..  I just did an 8 month marathon on my mouth... at least one visit a month and am so happy to be not going back ... !   I do believe, I would spring for a taxi...|`|kVDGsDuZaa	Take a taxi.    Hope all goes well!!|`|frwlypDWaa	Bring along something to catch the drool...|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	If you are in a warm enough climate the walk would be good for you.  25 minutes is not a long walk, everyone should be doing it every day anyway.|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	Suck it up buddy!!!!!

My advice get a taxi to pick you up and take you home right after your dentist visit.|`|yxtj5LUaaa	I wouldnt like it one bit.*|`|nkmwGAKjaa	Depending upon the weather, I recommend the walk.  By the time you get home the Novocaine will have worn off and you will have worked up an appetite for a nice supper.  ;-)  Good luck.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Yes! It will make your life easier and you can take your meds immediately.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	When facing the same situation I took a couple of headache tablets before the appointment as advised by an article on avoiding pain after the dental appt. and the freezing wears off, but you must carry on.

Cover yourself well, and be positive. Instead of having to wait a long time for the effects of the local anesthetic to wear off you will have already spent  45 minutes passing the time getting home.   I would take a taxi to be honest.. one drive home.|`|8a2c7511cfabb2e759e39cfc0b3a6c82aa	call  a taxi amd take it easy , take a nap and heal your mouth so you can enjoy the rest of hte day because you might feel a little dopey after all the novocaine|`|xWqKKp0Naa	i would take a taxi , but if i were there , i would piggyback you home .        * smile *          D :) :) :)|`|bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	hw, all you need is a pogo stick---lol.

RxLnfSVFaa	Hey there (same person who answered the other question.)    It really depends on what you are planning to do on the night. If like me, you are going to be pushing as close to the front as you can get, and baying for Jimmy lol, then don't wear heels. When I was at the Oxford leg things got pretty rough- there were several crowdsurfers, a lot of moshing and things got very heated, anyone in heels was in danger, and also a danger to other people- one girl in heels stepped on my foot and hurt me quite badly.    However if you are going to be chilling out near the bar, and just enjoying the music then you can probably risk heels, though it does mean that you will have to be alert all night in case someone tries to push past. I seriously would go with a cute ballet slipper type shoe, or if you *really* want heels then go for chunky ones on boots. As to what to wear, unless you are really short, high heels with skinny jeans is a no-no a lot of the time, but especially at a gig. Go for the slipon shoes, or boots.    For example I'm going in a black dress, with red fishnets and flat black suede boots. They do nothing for my calves, but I'll be able to mosh with the best of them!    Hope this helped|`|elECfJ52aa	buy some tennis shoes easier to move around in crowds|`|YfCRmWeSaa	your feet will hate you|`|qZF4r71taa	Bad idea.|`|7xoMXSEqaa	Don't wear heels to a concert ..  OBVIOUSLY.|`|mF7uxVmLaa	if you only own heels, I feel very sorry for your feet.     You're going to be standing up there awhile.     Get some comfortable shoes that are cute & fashionable! You can never go wrong with flats.

z3j9a31taa	Well basically its cos they're sad and depressed and have no real meaning to there lives. That is why they drink so they can forget they don't have a purpose for their lives. Similarly that is why people go clubbing,  cos they can forget about there pointless lives, and after the party is ova the reality kicks in and you are depressed. This is all just a way of covering up true depression, and they think it is a life. In reality this just really sad. And they won't admit it.    they say "i had a great time this weekend", then ask "what happened" and they reply "don't even know". That is just sad and not a good time. You remember good times, this is all just a cover to up there sad lives.   They say it is fun. There is nothing wrong with fun, however, it really isn't cos it serves no purpose and there are always bad consequences and why would anyone want to be in a situation like that. Cos they live poinltess pathetic lives and just want to forget with all the adrenaline and drugs and alcohol.|`|0CET3S3daa	Because they don't get to drink other things like juices.

I'm new to town so I had no idea who they were but apparently, they are rather well known and weren't bad.

A few years ago there was a thing that I saw and it wasn't there so I said, 'hmmmm' but it didn't go away but was still there yesterday so today and tomorrow I began dranking liquor (yes dranking) which helped the thing to be blue instead of red and that was really helpful but then I was hungry so I had oatmeal.    did you know that there was no you only me?

I don't know if it's the last thing I lost, but I lost a bunch (i.e., sh!tload) of stamps that my father had collected during and after WWII.  They were from India, Korea, etc. -- all countries from the Far East.  I have no idea if they were worth anything, but my stomach hurts when I think about it.  Thanks for asking!!

NY2fpmvPaa	In Idaho I can testify that most of the strippers are fat and fugly. That poll HAS to be held in by concrete on either end. Seriously.|`|UL3sHgqNaa	Yep...you need to be at least 200 lbs|`|XsmPnMU4aa	No they are made of stainless steel and can hold alot of weight.     Plus fattys are to fat to swing on them so nothing can take them down as long as you bolt them up good.     Im a stripper expert.|`|uQUqZ7k5aa	i would be worried about the pole itself, i worry the floor when a 300 lb stripper falls of the pole.|`|EiB6GNxlaa	whoa.. whats with Gemma B... she seems angry..  geez      the answer is NO.. there is no weight limit.. I went to a bachelor party and there was a BIG girl there working the pole.... and guys were digging it..     but yeah, it sort of looked like if you were fishing in a pond for bass & you hooked shark...   benddddd|`|gnRPC6Lvaa	nope they are made to not break in case there is the one stripper who just happens to b big|`|mwv79AIhaa	id vote for a censorship on the weight limit, but big ones need to have thier fun too.|`|8pe9ZDMxaa	180 pds maximum.|`|wUodHpEuaa	you stole my answer agent...  hey kevin james was pretty good|`|AA11523465	I would think so.|`|WiQQUNQLaa	lol i wonder thaatt tookinda|`|WKcJE9bKaa	Probably not, they are used sometimes for weight loss, so they must be pretty tough.|`|VJREeIgNaa	My girlfriend uses a scaffold pole and a concrete base...    it's not pretty when she bends over|`|frjSBxzBaa	have no clue but apparently they can hold up kevin james   there is an episode in king of queens and he is dancing on one funniest thing i have ever seen|`|I9mFZu0Eaa	I wish I could help but I threw away the instructions of mine..|`|VSBVqfRCaa	well you need to be able to get up the pole.|`|fCHlfGKPaa	thats why you double reinforce them    ceiling to floor and underneath the ground to the earths core|`|KdcansIyaa	There should be. A few times that i have gone there is always that ONE that is enough to be 5 strippers. I think they use a thicker pole for them. But i mean they do not do any moves cause there to fat. Its so foul.|`|XjcrMNBuaa	im waitin to see D's answer  =)        lol..awww d..u disappointed me..thought u were gonna post that clip  lol...there u goooo...now if u dont get best answer on this than i dont know what will  =)|`|aKBqMLuhaa	the limit is set only by ones ability to hold their own weight. so yeah my guess is that most women have a weight requirement for pole use.|`|FgHwxPeGaa	good question....    it'd be funny if it broke...    it wouldn't be entertainment any longer|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	My husband talked me into going to the strip club when we were just dating, and it was my first experience being to one, and the first girl to come out was at least 200 lbs, I was shocked and my husband laughed at me, strip clubs are nothing like you see in the movies, needless to say we haven't been back to that one, but in answer to your question I doubt that they do. That would be funny though, to see someone stripping and acting all sexy, and have the pole break on them!!!!|`|iE7nwMVnaa	Yeah, I'm guessing their would be a weight limit lol.
t9qXQI19aa	My sister's roommate does that. I once asked her if she carried baby wipes and her pencil around so she could change up her expression.    She wasn't amused.|`|7eMbNjWzaa	I like to shave mine off and draw them back on with Sharpies. It looks awesome until I get out of the shower|`|AA11101806	because women can then have pencil thin eyebrows and look constantly surprised about everything.|`|KdcansIyaa	I agree. Its beyond foul and gross. I think i would rather talk to a 300 pound chick then a chick with drawn on eyebrows|`|3mRKWJXpaa	I wax them, but I draw in a tiny part, where my eyebrows aren't even.    I know a few people who wax them completely off and then draw them...  I don't get it.|`|M7W7lZBBaa	my favorite is when they go for the surprised drawing, that always makes me giggle|`|UL3sHgqNaa	So you can look angry 24 hours a day|`|mwv79AIhaa	i gotta get my shape down perfectly, dont they look good?      jk, but have been told that before.|`|l72stAYqaa	I like to shave my eyebrows and then glue live catapillars on them.    http://www.thenicheplayers.com/news/stor...|`|NY2fpmvPaa	So you can draw swirly swirls as eyebrows. There are so many possibilities. One day I got carried away while plucking and plucked a little too much out. So, one one of my eye brows I had a half-brow. So, I made the other one even. SLOWLY it's all coming back. But I have to draw on half of them. So annoying. Don't do it.     And I wasn't even doing meth or anything.|`|WiQQUNQLaa	i knoww i dontget ittt|`|IV7oCMN8aa	Oooo That's so damn hot. Nothing like sharpy eyebrows.|`|fCHlfGKPaa	lol my brothers ex had the hair removed and then had the eyebrows tattooed on

FHYjZx1Kaa	I'm sorry but.........    Yes I think you'll find its in your contract terms and conditions that they have this right. They get hassle from the owners of the music and are put under pressure to suspend your account - They don't like to lose customers but it'll sure teach pirates a lesson if they can no longer get an internet provider!!|`|aLwrpMPXaa	It's not fair but in any case, some websites for downloading music, want you to pay to become a member and I suppose, if you pay, it's legal.|`|zyTrMeovaa	those bastards have too much control.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	They write to you first.     They wouldn't cut you off without two or three warnings.    I think you can safely say that if you download music for free on one of those file sharing sites, it's illegal. Any legitimate music site would ask for payment details, or explicitly state if it was a free download.     The illegal ones aren't going to post a note on their home page reminding you of it! THIS SITE IS ILLEGAL! lol    Edit: Yes limewire would be illegal. Watch out!|`|0CET3S3daa	If a website allows me to download something, it means it's legal, not illegal.  So I don't think it's fair for the internet provider to have the power to shut off the internet connection because of it.|`|m6jE5KVUaa	After I checked into this turns out they can and are...They have went after everyone else now they are turning to Internet preoviders to deal with people downloading illegal...Limewire is covered in how they are set up...Read the small print...LOL I dont agree with it, I think it is stupid to go after the consumer|`|3wFt9fyZaa	You must have downloaded alot of Music.....normally they would call and warn you.|`|hviykDAraa	i think thats stupid!! They shouldnt have the power at all!!   They should just provide you with the internet and then its in your hands what you do with it then!!|`|rpqHLJGGaa	No they should mind their own business! It`s already like 1984,  If i download a music vid from youtube is it me that`s the villlain or the guy that posted it..|`|JOAPnhOgaa	how would the provider know what you are doing in your private home on your computer???  it sounds very dodgy to me i am not sure what they do is legal!!!|`|va4DLO1Daa	It's not fair ,they should leave it to our own risk and we should be ready to face the consequences of illegal downloading.In most of the websites they would give some kind of warning messages before downloading .Limewire ,I think is legal because they are just bringing u the downloading link of the song from various sources that u have asked for and it's only acting as a search engine.It's up to us to decide to download the songs illegally or not.      ()|`|qZF4r71taa	Yes, Limewire is legal...in some states.  It depends on what state you live in.|`|rWCliJTuaa	If it's free, it's probably illegal. And yes I do think it is fair for them to disconnect you|`|RD05jXYwaa	power is power  and you have little. tmm|`|ilftGfhMaa	If you didn't have to pay for your music downloads then it's technically an illegal site.    They've been cracking down on sites like Limewire lately, but I'm not 100% sure on that...    They'll probably make it so you only have the option to buy Limewire and get rid of the version that's free.    Limewire Pro will be the only version soon I guess.|`|t1inn1nLaa	No, because thats a breach of privacy in the first place    Most P2P software have some form of packet encryption    The ISP will need to be doing some serious probing into our internet traffic to know what we are downloading    How can we trust them with all our personal information if they keep track of all our data we send and recieve?|`|85da46ed027af96aa8233e30bac20ba9aa	Each ISP has terms and conditions. These specify what you can and can not do with your internet connection.  If your ISP states that you can not download large amounts of data then you are in breach of the T&C's for you ISP and they can then either slow down your connection or cut you off. They ISP does not need to know what you are downloading to do this. They always monitor the network traffic to ensure they do not get charged extra by the big companies that supply the actual network itself.  Also, there are key words that are checked for to provide security for the whole of society. These are words like 'bomb' or 'explosives', if these words appear in the outgoing network traffic, then there may be someone whom the security services should be monitoring. People get up in arms about the governments not doing enough to catch these people but if the traffic is not monitored then your lives are at stake. Note, this is not recording all your data and is therefore not in violation of the data protection or personal privacy.
NXwzuv3Paa	yes i do|`|a893b2d2332387b71e69d418087c9c7eaa	No. My parents were really good & I never doubted they loved me.     My experiences have been largely the result of my own bad choices.

6gthdHpnaa	I don't even take it seriously when someone my own age asks me out, because they really have no reason to. I'm not pretty or cute or anything, so I always think they're joking and say no.|`|rsHbMpjXaa	Yes of course I would have enough respect for them to take it seriously, and I'd be gentle, but I highly doubt I'd go out with them. Twenty years is way too much, almost another generation really. Fifteen is pushing it too.|`|WB028eTDaa	I would take it seriously, but I mean, it probably wouldn't work out. Not that much of an age difference. But on the contrary, I know some people married that are 10 years apart, and they're completely in love.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	This of course only applies if I were single, which I am not...    Well younger, definitely no because they would be children lol. Older though, depending on if I found them interesting and was attracted to them, then why the hell not. We're both adults and age is just a number.|`|R1zUIh7taa	Older then I would take it seriously, younger I would laugh and think that is really cute!|`|4I2iOOqIaa	it only depends on the person who is asking.(age doesn't make them a cute or good person you would like to be around)

Some girls in the apartment uptown uh, some homeless people maybe 5 or 10 um an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun, and some man uh some old ****** with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw, I had to, she almost got away and uh someone else there I can't remember maybe a model, but she's dead too. And Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here. I guess I've killed maybe 20 people, maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it, uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even, um... I ate some of their brains, and I tried to cook a little. Tonight I, uh, I just had to kill a LOT of people. And I'm not sure I'm gonna get away with it this time. I guess I'll uh, I mean, ah, I guess I'm a pretty uh, I mean I guess I'm a pretty sick guy. So, if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry's Bar, so you know, keep your eyes open.    You're a ******* ugly *****. I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood    There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory.

AA10560773	First off, I DO agree with you and or your thoughts. The neighbors should have been MORE concerned with this man BEFORE this tragedy. NOT after. But I also think feel and believe that this action by the electric company or ANY utility company should be allowed. EVER.  I have an older gentleman that lives next door to me. And even tho he has two sons who visit him regularly I DO clear his driveway every-time that it snows.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Disgraceful.

This is corporate murder.   Take care.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I watch my neighbours who are around me, heck I shovel their driveways for the sake of it.

At some point the old guy should have asked for outside help in some form. He probably didn't know many people which is all the more reason why his neighbors should have kept on eye on him.  People today are so consumed with looking out for themselves, its disgusting. The neighbors should feel very bad about this.

AA11601079	What in your opinion is the best movie of all time? "Citizen Kane." I studied it in a film class, and I can't believe that a 26-year-old put together something so timeless and directed something so well.    What is your favorite movie that was made in the last twenty years? "L.A. Confidential." It just has one of the best plots, not to mention that it's so stylish and well-acted. It's one of my favorite films of all time.    What is your favorite movie that has been out more than twenty years? Maybe something like "The Graduate." It remains funny, even to this day. Same thing with "The Sting." Another great film. And "a Streetcar Named Desire," which is such a wonderful adaptation of the play and has some wonderful acting from the entire cast.    And finally what is your favorite movie that was low budget went under the radar and not many people are aware of? Last spring, I saw "The Fall" in the theater. I can't believe people more people didn't see this film. It's an elaborate fairy tale that takes place over maybe 18 countries. If people liked "Pan's Labyrinth," they will like "The Fall" as well. Also, "All About My Mother" and the very funny "Mediterraneo." I think Americans should watch more foreign films.|`|hDSENEUyaa	What in your opinion is the best movie of all time?  Godfather Parts 1 and 2  What is your favorite movie that was made in the last twenty years?  Goodfellas  What is your favorite movie that has been out more than twenty years?  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest  And finally what is your favorite movie that was low budget went under the radar and not many people are aware of?  Defending Your Life|`|Pe5MtPf0aa	The best movie Ive ever seen is called "Pay It Forward" and the second best movie is probably "The Wave"|`|26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	Wow. Most of the people who have answered know a lot about movies. I sure don't but I'm going to give you my answer anyways.    What in your opinion is the best movie of all time?  Titanic. Not the old one, the new one, with Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. That movie moves me to tears everytime... which is rather strange, because I don't normally get emotional over movies. I love that movie so much, it's a pretty unhealthy obsession. I was so excited when I found out that Kate and Leonardo were doing another movie together! Jack and Rose, have the greatest love story ever told. It began with suicide. It was centered around disloyalty. And it ended with death. Physically, for Jack, and Emotionally for Rose.    What is your favorite movie that was made in the last twenty years? Well besides Titanic, I'd probably say Remember the Titans. Yeah, I'm still amazed at the fact that it's a DISNEY movie. Well, it's based off of a true story, but if I didn't know any better, I never would guess that that movie was produced by Disney. That movie really depicts the struggle, that many still live with today, even if it's not here in America.    What is your favorite movie that has been out more than twenty years?  The Godfather movies... :) Classic.   Oh and Casa Blanca[:    What is your favorite movie that was low budget, that went under the radar and not many people are aware of?  I actually haven't seen any low-key films. Not that I can recall at least...which is really a shame because I bet some of those movies are amazing. I'll be checking in with this question to see what other people say though! :] I would have said slumdog millionaire, if this question had been posted a while ago, but now everyone knows about that movie... It's still a masterpiece either way though. :]    Oh and if anyone's ever in the mood for a comedy watch the movie "Cool Runnings" It's hilarious.

I was like 5 or 6 and I was just starting swimming the idiot didn't call out any names so I thought I was with the female but she was a level 5 instructor so they told me to step off the table in the water and I almost drowned luckily she saved me.     I still can't swim today becasue I'm tooo afraid of drowing|`|7f2GSDmqaa	That sucks dude...sorry to hear that|`|elECfJ52aa	Get back in the water  have someone with you and walk around in it then start going deeper|`|l69tjl0paa	So sorry that happened to you! But you didn't drown to death! Water is dangerous but also wonderful, try your best to enjoy it!|`|6swsBRzVaa	I had the same experience when i was a kid,and i have a love and fear relationship with water,i can sit on a beach for ages and i love how peaceful the sea is,and also i love to sail on ships and look out at the water,but i wont even think of going to the baths,even the shallow end,i feel very unsafe.    anyway i can understand your feelings and i hope you can become more confident to go near the water|`|89xzNpVaaa	Just try to jump into the water in the lake/pool and try to go deep with all your fear and excitement and you will never feel scared again.|`|lEjYhwxkaa	me too|`|vF4MgUWAaa	My mom has the same fear. I have an irrational fear of coleslaw. People have fears, whether induced or not, and I dont think theres anyway to get over them. Everyones different. Doctors told mother she'd be fine if she went swimming a few times. She did, and it made her worse.|`|Gznvci2baa	maybe hypnotherapy!|`|TK2GmcOhaa	When you were little - it's long ago now, and considering we may be plunging into the next Ice Age, I think you should learn to swim. Get some swimming lessons as a total beginner, and tell your instructor about your fear - they are used to dealing with 4-year-old kids screaming and shouting.    xxx    Go for it.|`|bv5kbxvUaa	And your question is? lol|`|c5bOFwaQaa	i can't swim well. i swim like a rock that can half way float.|`|wzNABeYZaa	Start out in the shallow end work up to deeper water  starting on memorial day by the end of summer  you'll be ok..|`|AA10980192	You can't be afraid of water as you have to use it every day, you drink it,you take shower with it. Nothing to be fear of water. So you could go to a children pool where water depth is about below your knee and have fun with water. Then learn swimming.|`|38d521cd1453ac69436083a1dfa790d5aa	The answer to your question is 42.|`|6MHuI3NXaa	my cousin is the same  way except she almost drowned in a lake  where we camped at... shes not over the fear yet.  so i guess you have to WANT to over come it.  and by doing that just go in water more.  the deeper the better.|`|dfSc0AbGaa	Take swimming lessons so you'll trust yourself when it comes to water.|`|1aocKlusaa	U need to get over ur fear and go swimming.    Keep doing this until u realize there is nothing to be afraid of.    What the worst that can happen u will drowned and die,,,,, we all die some day|`|0pxiYtFCaa	whats the question, love?|`|39d3d3ee8ed556965ecada72fada694daa	jump in|`|esdjKGeBaa	Well... It's gonna be tough, but you have to face your fear of water and... jump in. Litteraly. But do it under professional supervision.    On the other hand, you don't even have to face this fear, unless you want to become a lifeguard.
Lj2mo4ooaa	If the evidence is weighed and we are sure you are a terrorist, then . . . we do what we need to do to protect our people.  If that means some form of psychological torture, then so be it.      I do not believe in cutting off people's fingers or stretching their bodies or burning them . . . . but if it came down to doing that to a guy or experiencing another 911, then I say "do it."|`|mwv79AIhaa	torturous games should be saved for the bedroom..|`|6380221dbceb0381d89b54bd786e9f42aa	Torture is acceptable, and for all the bleeding hearts out there, humiliation is NOT torture.|`|p4sXZTtFaa	Yes.  Terrorists would do somethinf 500x worse than the so called "torture" we have in the western world    And did you see what they did in concentration camps in WWII, and what the communist Russians did to eastern/central europe? And the tests the Japanese and Nazis did on POWs?  That's torture, Gitmo is nothing.    It's just a bunch of PC people with nothing else to complain about|`|39uYZ4nsaa	Torture thier nuts off. After all, they have killed thousands on our soil and would love to kill us all. They think thier God wants this. Tear thier skin off in 1 inch strips for all I care.|`|BGKIJeTGaa	No!|`|M3Xmqlt8aa	Long ago someone remarked that torture does not work because the strong will go to their death before revealing a secrete, and the weak will lie to end their suffering.     If you think due process is an error maybe you should consider North Korea.    When these type of practices are accepted there is nothing to separate you from any other suspected terrorist in the eyes of an authority. Should you be tortured and maybe even killed because some one wrongfully believes you know something. Do you want to give up your constitutional rights and risk being a victim yourself?    The ideas you are presenting are completely subjective. The we in WW II had nothing to do with you at all, and my opinion is that you should take a deeper look at the danger of signing away your own rights in the mistaken belief that it is the rights of others you are getting rid of.|`|43JgLpkKaa	if it saves innocent American lives ... do it !!|`|jF1xH89Caa	I'm on the fence about it. Only because the fact that a detainee could say anything to get the torture to stop. On the other hand, you make a very good point with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. In this instance, it worked. So, I don't know. I guess we would would have to do some sort on evaluation on the POW to see if that particular person would lie to get the torture to stop.|`|AA11540629	Tiger,  I completely agree with you on this.

Hey D, I was just playing around about your ok's Ok?  I hope your not pizzed at me, I enjoy your questions and sense of humor!  Have a pleasant day.|`|AA11033942	Yes most definitely.    This kind of thing should be taught to children as soon as they learn how to walk. Whether you live in a big city, a small town or the countryside, where there are cars on the roads, there'll be an opportunity for an accident - which can be avoided if you know how to behave when walking down the roads.    I live in London (which not many of you realise is a far bigger city than you think it is) and in the centre of town there are lots of one way streets that demand your attention, even the ones with pedestrian crossings. There are many times when I see people in the suburbs not looking properly when crossing the roads.|`|73455c6a787c90036b88c6c36738f763aa	Yeah, everytime I cross a one-way street.

ycRwO0kWaa	i think that the answer to this question depends on the society but most of the time yes i believe that societies limit a person's abilities to be themselves because of the limits and the rules which most of the societies have ..|`|1dzzgaGZaa	if by being yourself you benefit society, it absolutely encourages you. if however, you're like the majority of people and just want to do your own selfish thing, then yea, society holds you back. either through laws or peer pressure|`|I13rHn1Waa	At times, this point is reallly true....sometimes the obligations of the society hinder a person to take a step in life.....|`|GizsyPAkaa	It depends on the individual and how much he allows society to restrict him. If he is the average person and wants to be acceptable in society, I believe most societies today allow a person to be.  On the other hand, if a person wants to be considered "great" and tries very hard to be popular in society, it mmay get restrictive for him.    Also if a person is very sensitive about what others say about him, he would be fettered, irrespective of how harsh or lenient the society around him is.|`|FPGqq2Tcaa	yes|`|9Pyx97uBaa	YES.  It's actually terrifying to think of the number of ways we are restricted from being who we truly are.  This is especially true for men.  We aren't allowed to be men anymore--in fact, we aren't allowed to even think that there once existed an archetypical set of behaviors and beliefs that constitue being a man.  (This is the main reason why Gran Torino was roundly ignored by the Oscars.  That may be the only good thing about this whole process--if we have to walk around like a bunch of eunichs, at least great art can come of it...)|`|04801d3cc6866a3e62c63b8e50c769eaaa	Yes. And the more crowded a society becomes, the more abnormal its members act. I believe that drug addiction, homelessness, child abuse, etc.,etc. are all symptoms of a sick society.|`|GgWGYWLPaa	YES.It is true.There are certain norms which limit a person`s ability in the society.|`|wz8gx3gaaa	I agree with you in this point.|`|7R7e6yX5aa	yes and no-i like to be myself despite bending social norms like not wearing deodorant all the time and yes i fart openly at work and so do my co-workers|`|t1inn1nLaa	Exactly
872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	Saturn could make a transit to a water house 4th 8th, or 12th.  signs of graduations would also be "activating" some personal planets in your chart, probably the 7th and 10th houses. any kind of personal evoluation is going to be directly shown somewhere on the axis.  but Saturn indefinately plays a huge part.|`|cuIX13BKaa	Honestly I haven't a clue.

Thank God the roads were clear. We had about 5" here in Wolcott, IN. There have been some slide offs this morning with the wind blowing the snow.    The funeral ceremony for Ingrid was real nice. Her brother decided because of her love of animals that she need them with her so he bought a stuffed horse, dog and cat to place in the casket. Five of her son's friends were driven up by the one boy's mom and dad and served as the pall bearers along with her mom's other grandson.    When I got home I decided to look at the answers. Glad I did. I forgot it was Happy Hump Day. I really got a kick out of the ones who provided the terriffic contributions to Happy Hump Day. They made me laugh (almost out loud).    It's great to be back even though I would have liked to be able to stay a few days more with Ingrid's Mom (Edith). She is ok most of the time when she has someone to talk to but crys a lot more when she is alone. Please pray for her and Ingrid's son (Scott) and her husband (Dan).    Glad Lincoln is gaining fast. If he keeps going it won't be too long before he will be able to go home. Isn't the magic   5 lbs?    Crazy H how far is your husband willing to travel to do work. I'm not sure what state you are in. If it were a little far from home we would put him up here while he does some work. We have 2 extra bedrooms.    bucsandducks sorry to hear about your grandmother. Like the others have said it was good you were able to be by her side when she went. She felt comfortable with you near.     Prayers for all. Please all get better.    jcm (Janet)

598OD7d6aa	If its a soft-cover fictional novel type book then used is fine, but if its a hard cover then I'd prefer it new.

I also do enjoy going to a used book store in my little town that has quite a selection and browse there and purchase books too.

I have a 106-year old book about world cultures, written very simply for perhaps seventh-graders. It is refreshing  to read how people classified others that many years ago and their attitudes or ideas about differences in human cultures. I bought the book for $1 last summer at a yard sale.  I bought another book about Africa which was published in 1954, and have visited one of the countries, Morocco. It was refreshing to learn some of the history without having modern politics interjected in it.|`|tvdabilNaa	If they are in good shape, I'll buy used.

46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	I have never bullied anyone.    Edit: As for your son being bullied i would say for him to do the stuff that the bully does him to the bully and then make the bully scared of him. Always target the ring leader they act to be stronger than they are they are 99% of the time one of the weakest in the group just acting bigger than their boots.|`|jCFWPWpUaa	No never. I know how painful it can be.|`|soFpywFcaa	noo i would never|`|ozpB4ADVaa	No I have not bullied.  I have been bullied.   I know for a fact that it is out of insecurity that a bully does it.|`|3w7ekDQJaa	I've done it because i was (and still am) anorexic/depressed and I needed to take my frustration out on people. You must understand that your son's bully is the real victim that is going by a different name.|`|spXPpyP0aa	I have never bullied anyone. I was the one being picked on.|`|f4doqdSCaa	Nope, not that I can recall. The worst I would do is ignore people I didn't like. I was bullied, only a little, when I was in grade school, but nothing horrible, more tormenting/teasing than anything else. Generally bullies do this either because they lack self esteem or they sense a weakness in another person.  All the help I can offer, sorry about your son!|`|DH6GMCdfaa	Weak people do it to feel better about themselves. Sometimes relating to the person/bully in someway makes them realize what theyre doing and in the end, may even become friends with them.    I had a bully when I was younger, grew up with them threw K  - senior year of high school. He ended up attempting to be friends with me freshmen year of college, but the harm he caused me made me to this day- dislike him.    But I think if maybe I would have knew then what I know now It would have been eaiser for me to deal with.     Read up on the interent about bullying, and give your son the truth. Tell him people will do anyting in their own power to feel better about themselves, even if it hurts others along the way.    He can't let it bother him though, he can't let himself be the victim. Because in the end, it isn't worth it. He needs to know he is better than that. Just keep encourging him through it all:) He isn't alone.|`|OegheALwaa	i have never bullied anyone.  but iv been bullied.   i always try standing up for someone when there getting bullied.   some of the kids that would bully me are now my friends. .  i think they do it to feel better about themselves.|`|dmcpdZKlaa	When i was like 13 all of my friends used to pick on this girl and say she had nits and another girl cuz she was a goth... i didnt want to be a bully but i supose as i was there too, i was also the bully.... i didnt do anything, but neither did i do anything to stop it....             i feel sorry for your son.    its probably a little fat ugly boy who is trying to look popular and cool by making someone scared.        have you spoke to the school? how old is your son?|`|P69Ob0eeaa	When I was younger I was bullied quite a lot, then ended up bullying a girl myself which I really regret. I think that is one of the main reasons. If you've been bullied youself then it can make you angry and you tend to bully others who might be younger/smaller because it makes you feel like your not the victim anymore.     Another reason, mainly in girls is pure jealousy. And also some bullys might have a hard life at home, so they adopt the attitude that if they're miserable, they'll make sure everyone else is too and just end up bullying people.    Have you talked to the school about your son? I'm sure they could sort something out, no one deserves to be bullied.  x|`|sbmzMVLraa	That's a shame. I hope he is ok.    No I have not bullied anyone as I am a nice person but at the High School I used to get bullied there by boys in my class and two girls who where sisters started punching me. I think they did this because I am really shy and find it hard to talk to new people.|`|2TW8P7ZEaa	You need to help toughen your son up or he will be bullied for the rest of his life.    People do it because they feel in control and powerful in front of 'weaker' people.|`|leDGyCW1aa	I did when I was at school. I was what you would call one of the leaders of the cool kids, we picked on the geeks. Wasn't a personal thing, kids are cruel and do anything to look good in front of their friends. If anyone stood up to us we let them be, I would suggest your son does that, is the only way it will stop.|`|ef831d986a5932fbeb4aaba747db2c77aa	I have never been a bully.  Bullies are insecure people.  I've had a horrible home life, but always had friends.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Heck no!    I used to joke around, and they thought l was bullying them and told on me! I mean, as if l'd do that :(    Anyhow, people do it for popularity, self-esteem or peer pressure. But whatever the excuse, bullying is NEVER acceptable.|`|cCdkSsTzaa	no|`|4SGBr8cWaa	no, i really am a nice guy, always was|`|WJvXapq8aa	nope, never...|`|xXRk7jTEaa	um... yeah, i did it to try and be cool like 4 years back...  you realise how wrong it was when you get caught, plus it is also an easy way to get attention, but you later realise how its getting it from the wrong ppl|`|IVN49C1vaa	yes i have...    if ur son is fat and ugly.. then there is ur problem    x|`|jaUBFRn1aa	Unfortunately I did in school...    I thought I was hard and "cool" by picking on people less fortunate than myself. Though me and my mates bullied a girl in the year below cos she had big boobs and we were jealous, it could be envy causing your sons bullies to pick on him.    All the best hun x|`|BqKdCjOIaa	yup  this faaat girl in 6th grade  i was her friend at first but then she became a total b*tch  it was pretty brutal...i would like pretend to be her friend but talk sh*t about her to her face and she just kinda stood their and took it haha|`|uI4WPwhsaa	yes i have...    and i think i did it for the attention...    and maybe i liked the feeling of making some one feel little...    i hate myself for it now...    how could i be so cruel?    i mean...that girl had been nothing but nice to me..    but don't worry...karma got me....|`|56216275babe93f0f69ad2124d3724deaa	i did it once when I was about 8 and I learnt my lesson for life.  I kicked a boy in front of my friends just because he came to our part of the estate! I was instantly sorry and have never forgotten it and remember watching him leaving crying.    Now 30 odd years later I still bitterly regret it and I have never treated anyone like that again.      I did it because I was showing off in front of my friends.  And I can safely say if he had fought back I would have backed down immediately because ultimately I am a scaredy cat.     I hope your son will be ok, I have also been bullied, lots of times and know it is horrible and very frightening.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	No|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Yes I  have, when I was in school|`|wmBK9uASaa	No never, people doit as it makes them feel superior and in control...|`|MmbLWe3Qaa	There was one girl in elementary school that got picked on pretty bad; I tried to be friends with her, but she was...weird. I think her home life was screwed, plus she might have had some mental disability or something. So I basically told her to stop playing with me, and left her alone to go play with my other friends. I know this sounds stupid, but I still feel guilty about that.|`|VfYvJypEaa	I don't think so , certainly not intentionally . People do it because they are scum simple as that .|`|NKuQh4sSaa	Yes I did once . I bullied the girl who had been bullying me to let her know how it felt to be on the receiving end for once . I didn't feel proud of myself or anything like that . I did it because she had given me years of misery and pain and I had an opportunity to turn the tables and I did it. It did work as she never had a go at me or any other kid after that. I never hit her, I did it verbally.|`|3qLIRorjaa	Bullies are very unhappy, insecure people who tend to pick on weaker people.    EDIT:  Idiots like Jenn (below) could do with a good slap though! - i'd do that!|`|Gqr63jT5aa	No because I know what its like to be bullied. I was bullied most of my time in school and It really affected me alot and I could never do that to another person. Honestly I think people do it just because it makes them feel better, but I don't don't know for sure because like I said I never bullied anybody.|`|7hrOjPwjaa	In have never bullied anyone but to this day i remember one occasion where a kid was being bullied quite badly in a physical way and i stood by and did nothing.  Years after the incident i saw the victim again and appologised for doing nothing but i still feel bad about it.  At the time i was quite immature and didnt want to look bad in front of my friends by stepping in and putting a stop to it. And i didnt want the bullies to swap to me.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	No. that's awful.   You can get help. If it is at school, go to the school, speak to his teacher, a guidance counselor or the principal or dean. If it is outside, go to your neighborhood police station, as each station usually has a Youth Officer. Also, there is plenty of info on-line. Do a search in Yahoo.  Good luck!|`|8VlDuMFOaa	No, I have never bullied. Bullying is so different now from when I was at school too.  While I am no expert, I think that a child bullies another to compensate for a lack of own security and self worth - often feeling like an out cast and and alone themselves.  While this behaviours is completely unacceptable, bullying is their way of feeling important, and screaming out for attention, even if it is of the negative sort.   I am certain that the environment they are brought up in has a lot to do with it. Some parents have a lot to answer for, but sadly often couldn't care less.    I hope the school your son is in has some kind of anti bullying system in place, so this issue does not continue.  best of luck. x|`|MtjR6yT2aa	Yes in the past - because i was feared.. i'm not proud of it..    Report it to the teachers and they'll back off
NKuQh4sSaa	Yes I have and I have just gone through it with my daughters.  Bullies are just low lives who feed on the fact that they can pick on someone just so they can make them look big and clever and tough , when in fact they are just big cowards . Schools should be tougher on bullies and get police involved to the bullies more . I have removed my daughters from school as they were doing more for the bullies than for the victims. Just as well my daughters were going to leave anyway as we are moving to another city , but the school denied they were having a problem with bulling and took no action at all, even though it was a 16 year old bullying my 11 year old ! My 13 year old managed to stand up to her but she got wronged for standing up for herself verbally. My eldest was bullied bad in primary school to an extent where she had to see a professional . It was verbal bullying , but that did more damage that physical bullying . It has took a long time to restore her self esteem , so when it started again , I took immediate action as I will not let anyone hurt my kids in anyway ,shape or form .|`|46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	I have had people try to bully me but i just stand up to them the wanna try hit me i will make sure i hit them just as hard back (or harder), If they say something to try to make me look silly or bad in front of their friends i will say something back, then their friends be laughing at them not me. That is the only way to get them to leave alone. I was also taught self defence etc at young age prepared for it all at school so i find that very useful.|`|mu94enaVaa	yea not physically emotionally but i know now that it was because they where just jealous of me so i dont have any mental scarring hehe|`|iTa38Xkdaa	Yes, at school I did.|`|C73WFizXaa	bullied?! i doubt thats even the word for it in my case.  i got shoved into lockers,  i had inanimate objects(chairs, tables, sticks, other peoples bags etc. etc.) thrown at me,  i was pushed down the stairs on several occasions,  i had stuff of mine id paid alot of money for nicked and destroyed,  someone tried to flush my head down the toilet,  someone jammed me in a door, and slammed it on my neck,  someone burnt my hand with a bunsen burner,  some tried to pour acid in my eyes,  some pushed me off my bike, and as my bike just slowly wheeled away a few feet, i fell down a drop 15 feet deep,  more happened to me but i dont wanna gross u out n e more|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Yes, l have been bullied.

The children bullied me because they thought the reason I didn't do it was because I was so heavy.  Thankfully, I recovered and lost weight. The bullying eventually stopped.  I now work in a school and I am very involved in the anti bullying activities there.|`|XmdS3hb2aa	I was bullied during school from first year senior to third senior. All it took was for me to stand up to the bully, i shouted her down in the yard in front of almost the whole school.     I hated how it felt, I still sometimes get scared like i did when i woke up on a morning knowing i had to go to school. This is usually if i'm starting a new job or something, where the people are different, its like i expect to be bullied sometimes.

Of course if she also like ribs and slaw, I might just have to marry her!|`|vtiea9eTaa	I have dated both and I will say a little shy and demure.

So be bold and do it on his/her face!!!    All the best ;)|`|QPA2AE0Laa	It is only wrong in some peoples' minds that someone be 'dumped' via an SMS message. I think that when others hear of someone being 'dumped' by text, it makes them think about how angry that would make them, and also how the other member of the relationship didn't have the "decency to say it person" (not my words).    I honestly don't mind how anyone decides to 'dump' anyone else. I mean, if the only way of telling them is via text message, or a letter, than shouldn't you do it? Or would you rather the person you are dating, continue to date you, even though they aren't happy or don't want to?    edit: Also, it's not wrong to ask someone 'out' via text message, so why is it unfair to do the opposite?|`|RD0yaJlgaa	it's wrong, you should face the person and tell him/her you don't love him/her anymore|`|bZGknHPFaa	that's awesome. it does work in the movies, and you should make it work in real life.|`|AA12311278	That will never work!

VXCCjdZhaa	Pick up an extra toothbrush on your way home, and liquid detergent (preferrably Tide) if you don't already have it. Put the pants on the counter and put a sock or rag between the layers, so you don't pass the stain to the other side of the pants, got me? Gently brush the liquid into the stain and let it sit for half an hour. Wash the pants and line dry, then repeat if neccessary. Usually won't be. It will work. I pretty much promise.|`|AI4My948aa	you sit on your hands, eh?|`|NcufdPaAaa	Cold water,  Then rub washing powder on the blood.  Then warm water.    They do it on a film..

I would also spray it with stain remover afterwards.  Once the pants are washed make sure the stain is gone before you put them in the dryer because the heat will make the stain set in.  If the stain is not out repeat the process again until the stain is removed.|`|3FFAIMpLaa	Oh!

NcNxIsynaa	dang I used to know this website where you could figure that out..um...you put your age your wife's age in the date when she got pregnant the date the baby is due.....divide that by how many miles it is to the hospital.....you find the square root of that number and viola` that is how old your baby is when it is born....WOW I can't believe I remembered the formula.....good luck and let us know|`|rLP9wjPtaa	Yes, you need to know where you are.

0mhcCyE5aa	How and when are the grapes dried?  In late August, grapes are hand picked, laid on rows of poly paper trays in the vineyard, and allowed to dry naturally in the sun. After two to three weeks, a fresh grape becomes a sun-dried raisin.     http://www.nationalraisin.com/raisins/tr...      How did I know you might ask!!    I heard it through the grape vine!!!|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Quizz answer sounds ok to me.|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Depending on the weather, the grapes are allowed to dry on the trays for two to four weeks. During this time, the moisture content of the grape is reduced from 75% to under 15% and the color of the fruit changes to a brownish purple.|`|19nQDjEmaa	Probably about a week!|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	Sultanas have rights too  enjoy|`|v0Bk9fWGaa	dunno hon. i stop when the wine bottles are full~]|`|73KnE9Kmaa	must be 3 weeks they have in my bowl lol.......?|`|WWT45CEzaa	about a week|`|1QiPrFyfaa	so is a raisin a mouldy grape?

Having said that, it has been a while since anyone told me to "have a nice day"....I think I notice it far more on my visits to the USA than here in the UK.

VFEZFanIaa	I met this girl online, who I started going out with and we met up for the first time at a park, she bought her mate, and I swear to God, we said hello and from that moment on, there was complete silence for an HOUR. A whole hour, in a park, tipping down with rain, they were sat together under an umbrella a couple metres away and I was just sat there, getting soaked, staring into space. They were obviously laughing at the situation, or at me, but trying to hide it, but I knew they were. Then after an hour had passed of NOTHING, her mum came and picked her up, they were nice enough to say bye though. That was the most AWKWARD of AWKWARD situations EVER.|`|w1kvhxX5aa	i was sitting herre and took a drink and i was thinking wow that was really awkward cause i was taking a drink just earlier|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	I have this pickup line I use...."if you were any prettier,you would have had to be born twins because ONE woman couldn't hold it all !"  well...I told this girl my line and she started crying ...she WAS a twin and her sister had just been killed 3 days before....AWKWARD...|`|hpdZDBVQaa	Getting caught by my mother jerking off in my bedroom at the tender age of 17.|`|B8Nz2KzXaa	hmmm,    that's to private to share it here...    -R|`|0GDgg2zsaa	its a secret. k? k.|`|U3jdAPVJaa	My mom asked me why I was looking up illegal drugs and their effects on the internet...it was for research but it was reeeeely awkward :)|`|pElG2K61aa	Having a string of Lifestyle condoms fall out of my knapsack and land across a pretty Argentinian girl's feet.

We where in the middle of "The Notebook" and we thought he went to his room, but he was watching over our shoulders. And a 'PG 13' part started and he was all like 'Okay kids, look away from the tv or im calling your parents' and we paused the movie and stared at him like 'your ruining our movie, get the hell out of here' and then he made us fast forward. I was humiliated. And then he talked to their parents! Though their parents were cool with it because we were already 15.|`|fca3b6ac45b683b2c3cb75b6bfcba848aa	me friends(two) went for swimming......one of them entered the pool and the other one was about to do that.......suddenly a man came n said," sir plz take the shower first"...the one who dint enter said ok......n vs going to do the same......the other friend shouted n said ."get one for me also"  :)) lolzzzz|`|1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	Several years ago, I was with two of my best friends at a Hair/Nail Trade Show in Macon, Georgia.  I was a Nail Tech and they were Cosmetologists.  I was wearing one of those long broomstick skirts.  Anyway, we were walking down isles and isles of product that seem to go on forever and ever when I kept noticing a draft.  I seemed to ignore it for quite a while but then it finally got the best of me..........     All of a sudden, I turned my head around -- kinda like a hoot owl would do -- and I looked down towards the back of my leg; and I suddenly realized that the hem of my skirt had somehow managed to jump up and tuck itself into the band of my brand new lace panties!!!  All I could do at this point was holler and say......."well good Lawd.....my dress has done went and hung-ed it's self up into my brand new panties!!!"  My friends laughed so hard that one of 'em peed in her pants.  Everybody else in the room was hysterical at this point.  I was laughing so hard by this time that I was crying!!!    I have no idea how long that d@mn dress had been that way; nor how many people had admired my new lace drawers.  But once I got everything back situated like it should be, I went right back to shopping and having a large time.  That is one trade show that we (and several others, I'm sure) won't ever forget!!!   ^_^|`|YaN0PtZKaa	Well i don't know which was more awkward.  1. Walking in on my parents having sex.  2. having to describe it to my best friend, whom I made a terrible mistake of telling.     And people think I'M weird. psh :(|`|MNRRpYgLaa	One time I was giving my impromptu speech to the whole class when I suddenly ran out of ideas and I was like juz standing there looking at the class, with nothing to say. Time passed juz so slowly then...|`|EOgxfaZjaa	It was when I was wearing a long, flowing skirt and stepped up on a stool in front of my male boss.  When I stepped up on the stool, my foot caught on the hem of my skirt and pulled it down so that I mooned him.|`|x8B4527Jaa	My most recent one..a guy I liked reached out for a high-five when we were playing sports and i went and hugged him.

Then he smiled and waved at me. and,  THE OLD MAN WAS A STRANGER!!|`|0ece3ea96233735c56393ae48382a64caa	When I was 18 yrs. old (back in '83), I had a beautiful '68 Corvette convertable. I stopped at a gas station where there was a real cute girl working the counter. When I went inside to pay for the gas before I pumped it, I realized I only had $1 in my pocket. I had to ask the cutie to allow me to pump $1 worth of gas with that beautiful car!|`|jSpO8Neiaa	one time at highschool i went to the bathroom and when i came back, everyone was laughing at me, even the teacher. then i realized that my cock was sticking out of my pants.

(not that i'm TOO embarrassed...cough...8 1/2 inches...cough...)|`|KWWL5coyaa	I ran into my sisters room exicted to see her. I went in and she was in her underwear changing clothes.

That was now weird :)|`|8IxC4MAyaa	well i was with my ex-girlfriend. we were about to...um...do adults things lets keep it clean. forgot my front door was unlocked and my dad showed up. i told her to stay in the bed room and i'll try to get rid of him. just as he was about to leave, she decided to walk out and say hi. then of course he had to tell everyone. i heard about it for a long time. lol oh well that's life. =)|`|5YTkGB5yaa	My grandma stopped by unexpectedly and walked in on me when I had a girl in my bed.

The chicken's predecessor (whatever came before the chicken) would have laid the egg and hatched it. The resulting chick would be first chicken but the egg was obviously first.|`|RA8PuTd5aa	Chicken, god can create people but the egg would need to be warmed to hatch.... can't do that without a mother chicken|`|cBqOPGcpaa	the egg    what ever it was before it was a "chicken" as we know it today (assuming we all agree with the theory of evolution), probably still came out of an egg|`|AA11024277	chick|`|cgqgomawaa	have you never seen the picture?    http://www.huxter.org/cartoons/cn-chicke...|`|Rz6KwQjKaa	Well, if the egg came first, it would have had to have twins in it so they could make more. Therefore, I think chicken is correct.  That is my final answer. :}        But I really think the ultimate question is: pancakes or waffles?|`|GfphOIdOaa	Might want to redefine your question, since it leaves open several possibilities.    In your sentence the Chicken comes first.    If the egg is not necessarily of any specific type: Then it could be said that the egg came first, because other animals had been laying eggs long before chickens existed, such as the dinosaurs. In biology, egg is used as a general term in this way.    If only an egg that will hatch into a chicken can be considered a chicken egg: Then a re-consideration of the original question suggests: Some animal other than a chicken laid the first chicken egg which contained the first chicken. In this case the chicken egg came before the chicken. In reality, many scientific theories suggest that this would not have been a simple event. For example, the theory of Punctuated equilibrium theorizes that the actual speciation of an organism from its ancestral species is usually the result of many mutations combined with new geographical surroundings, called cladogenesis.    If only an egg laid by a chicken can be considered a chicken egg: Then a re-consideration of the original question suggests: The first chicken (which hatched from a non-chicken egg) laid the first chicken egg. In this case the chicken came before the chicken egg. Again, this would not necessarily be a straightforward event.    If only an egg that is laid by a chicken and that will hatch into a chicken can be considered a chicken egg: Then the first chicken came from a different type of egg (not a chicken egg) and laid the first chicken egg. In this case eggs (in general) came first, the chicken came after, and the chicken egg came last.    The modern chicken was believed to have descended from another closely related species of birds, the red junglefowl, but recently discovered genetic evidence suggests that the modern domestic chicken is a hybrid descendant of both the red junglefowl and the grey junglefowl. Assuming the evidence bears out, a hybrid is a compelling scenario that the egg came before the chicken.|`|l6Kii2Uiaa	The Chicken Omelet|`|106uKaEYaa	The Egg!|`|xWaCmo4Taa	egg:)   everything starts young|`|0mXQODsIaa	chicken, but then a rooster is needed|`|lMeoMz8Aaa	the chicken!|`|RFcbLXh3aa	the chicken|`|IXxSiXHtaa	Dinosaurs babies came in eggs, so I am saying chronologically its got to be the egg.|`|mPSekOURaa	EGG!|`|MIltW9p5aa	THE EGG!|`|fTLzKg5Eaa	Fried please.. with Green salad    Ahh sorry misanderstood   errr...

But it's just a theory.|`|z5WNJkx9aa	Depends on whether you are a creationist (who would say the chicken came first) or an evolutionist (who would say the egg came first).

dlqa6yFkaa	When I was at school I remember one of my teachers telling us a true story about a pastor taking his son and a friend fishing in a boat, a big storm blew up and both boys fell overboard, the pastor saved the friend and left his own son to die. When he was asked why he said because he knew where his son was going after he died but he was not sure about the friend.     I've never forgotten that and know I would give up my own life in a heart beat to save anyone of my children.|`|pI4qZrnBaa	best friend|`|ogB0KDPVaa	Mine     P|`|tPV0MlgKaa	Always look out for number 1-ME!!!!!!!!|`|SChNv6Bvaa	Mine. yeah|`|39uYZ4nsaa	My wife is my best friend, and yes I'd die for her!|`|RD0yaJlgaa	my bestfriend of course.

KuWLNfYbaa	People like me who are confident about life and like to relax and listen to the words of country music which make sense and reflect all aspects of normal life,|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	I only LOVE Tim McGraw :o)|`|kG9oI68eaa	I love country!!!|`|Lj2mo4ooaa	My black friends think that all white people listen to country music.

KOctm8uKaa	Married might be too strong a word but if quarreling and apologizing fall in this forum a balance is important too. Have a big, fat fight every now and then. Because when you fight, you don't just raise your voices, you raise real, sometimes buried  issues that challenge you to come to a clearer understanding of you, your mate, and your relationship. I wouldn't give up our fights for anything in the world, because I know in the end they won't break us; they'll only make us stronger.|`|QiThGrhEaa	Good grief ...

I take physical pain easy...emotional pain, the opposite.|`|e3AnmkfUaa	physical|`|ycRwO0kWaa	neither|`|3JLg1tcRaa	I would pick emotional, because you can solve it a lot easier than some physical pain.  I have been in some serious physical pain.. I had a bone marrow biopsy, and it was 100X worse than being in labor, and I have two kids.  I couldn't walk good for a week, and I still have pain once in awhile.|`|Vlq4bW20aa	Emotional, you can do things to put it out of your head for a while.  Physical pain can not be suppressed.|`|4hEbaIMOaa	emotional.|`|y7ZAnmPUaa	physical|`|pI4qZrnBaa	physical|`|UciBYuIUaa	physical|`|lFPsPzxzaa	physical|`|mDNeumBmaa	Um emotional of course, have you ever experienced physical pain? It hurts...so not my deal!!|`|I4oSggsJaa	physical    ive had nothing but emotional pain|`|AA11117232	I agree with Sweet Lulu---neither one.  But, that is not one of the choices in your question.  A very interesting question, by the way!!  Having experienced both-----If I were forced to make a choice I would choose physical over emotional pain.   Physical pain can be treated with medication, assistive devices (cane, walker), physical therapy, surgery.    Emotional pain can be eased by medication, psych therapy, prayer, love of friends and family.  But, comparing the two, I believe the emotional pain stays with us longer.  One doesn't remember the physical pain, although it can be described in detail, but one does not feel the pain when thinking or talking about it.  As versus emotional pain, which is felt anew.  Well, that's my 2cents (well, okay! more like 3 cents!)  Bye, now!

I agree with him..|`|EVnlDpPUaa	Most certainly not.|`|dlqa6yFkaa	No way 30 is the new 20.|`|4hEbaIMOaa	no.|`|Tg93jevcaa	Yes. If a person dated and had sex they did have a serious commitment at some point (though perhaps never admitted it). In their later years they will look back and discover they had a first love but never told the other person.   With luck, the person will find their first love again and tell them they were the one.  That is pathetic.|`|lEjYhwxkaa	no|`|BP7SfeGPaa	i dont know ya but for me NO and i advise you not to think about it caz life passes like it's passed until now|`|RD0yaJlgaa	think about Andy in the movie "The 40 Year Old Virgin", never had a love life, never had sex. He just ignored what everyone says until he finally met a woman|`|AA12256144	Certainly not. Much worse to commit insincerely for the wrong reasons.|`|TiBFerMyaa	I know a lady who has never married, no kids, and still living at home with her now elderly parents.

I'm considering advice from a friend and starting night classes in life drawing, just so I can meet a girly :)) . Maybe you should think about something like that ? You just need to be more outgoing, above all get out there and meet people.

Look, I KNOW I want to be with my fiance forever and that's cool but sometimes, I just think "Boy, I'm young and I have hd so little experience and I should just get it out of my system, etc...", ya know?!

wA8Dyhq7aa	I remember when he died most of the news reports listed him as "the son of Tim Buckley" and mentionted the fact that he was a singer/songwriter on his own as an afterthought.      As for popularity, he was popular in the area he lived in, which isn't uncommon in folk music (e.g., Chicago folkies were very popular there but only a few are well-known outside of Chicago, New York folkies are popular in the Village but few break out to national success).  There weren't the outlets for non-commercial music like XM/Sirius and Americana format radio back then, so he didn't get a lot of national exposure.|`|e0EG293naa	Not very famous but his voice is amazing and something that just does not exist today in the music scene.  Too bad :(|`|pQE5eZcqaa	Not that famous tbh|`|kKQtnfvpaa	One hit Wonder for his Leonard Cohen cover pretty much.|`|AA10374849	He wasn't really that famous in the mainstream arena, but he was one of the most revered musicians in the Indie world. So those people who have experienced hearing his music during the Sin-e' days are fans up to now - and they are responsible for making his music heard, with or without the CD releases.    No one can really quantify his popularity because his CD did not sell millions... but if his fans were the likes of Bono, Paul McCartney, Jimmy Page... then that says something about his legacy.     A great songwriter, with an unbelievable voice range and guitar skills -- no one can ever compare to him.

pRF5LLloaa	What is MORE important:    1) Know your instrument inside out.  Be versatile; be able to play ALL style of music.  Listen to ALL kinds of music, including classical, Oldies, rock'n'roll, county, and hip-hop.  Take lessons; learn to read music. Memorize the songs you play the most.  2) Check you ego at the door.  A BAND means that you have to work with other people.  The reason most bands fail is that each person thinks that they are the best player and should be the leader.  There can be only ONE band leader. Decide on who that is going to be, and then you have to follow his wishes.  3) Don;t be afraid to fail.  Most musicians fail miserably in the first 5 or 6 bands they play with.  So just go looking for another band.  4) Learn to play piano.  Stick with the guitar, but learn yo harmonize with the piano.    You need to first build up your reputation by playing with different bands, and playing different styles of music.  ALWAYS do your best job.  Stay out of the drugs and alcohol. Build a reputation as a good, solid player who knows everything.    It may take a few years, but eventually you don't have to audition.  The band sstart calling you, asking you to play with them.    One thing for sure, music is based on fads. What you like to play this year, maybe nobody wants to hear it in 5 yearsw.  You HAVE to be versatile to "make it".  So don't limit you experience to listening to or imitating just one sound.|`|ZrpA7By4aa	mmmmm  ask around with your friends and acquaintances to see if they either play any instruments themselves or know someone who does. if you can get a drummer, a vocalist and a bassist or pianist, you've got yourself a band. Make sure that you have similar musical tastes and want to play the same kinda music. you could also use the internet to find members for your band.

A gentle, caring approach to certain conversations is a much better way to go. If the phrase "It should have been me" comes up, that's probably one of those times to use active listening and let the person explore his or her feelings. If you must respond, "Maybe it wasn't meant to be you" can work, especially if the situation in question is a tragedy.

nDSLNnguaa	Because America is so busy they don't take time to eat right. Mom and Dad both work so they stop and get McDonald's on the way home cause it's fast and cheap.  They super size because America HAS to have the biggest of everything, right? Then they go home for some stimulating television because America HAS to have over 600 television channels.  Oops, it's bedtime now, have to get rested up for another busy day tomorrow- Oh didn't have time to exercise.  Well, maybe tomorrow.    See where this is going?    I have thought about opening up a "fast fruit" restaurant (of course it wouldn't only have fruit- but you get the picture.  The thing is it probably wouldn't last two months in our obese market)    Sorry for the rant ;)     Edit: btw, I love those commercials where they go to the fast food place and order a meal of love handles with a side of can my butt look any bigger- LOL  The truth is often spoken in jest :)|`|BGKIJeTGaa	All countries have their share of obesity and anorexia.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Too many fast food restaurants.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	Have you ever visited another country?

Abundant population  Is it technologically advanced  Are resources in good supply there  Ect. Ect.    But I would say the 5 top contenders would be Japan, USA, Australia, UK, and China. Not only are they powerhouses, but they are all abundant in natural resources, all are very technologically advanced, and they all have a good sized population, except for maybe the UK.

AIG for example, wants BILLIONS in governement handouts, yet insists on giving hundreds of millions in bonuses because they were earned BEFORE their crisis!  Uh, maybe they were their worst enemy here...promising money they didn't have....    No CEO or otherwise should get bonuses if jobs are lost or shipped over seas. It's a tough economy, they should adapt. Make me CEO of a major company and I'll do it for $100,000 with no bonus or stock options just to prove it can be done.

Especially if you happen to be attractive yourself ! Make sure your clothes look well expensive even if youv'e got them from a cheap shop..

3PzenEPUaa	I would sort out the benefit system, kids have kids today as a source of income and half the country are on incapacity benefits through 'stress' or a bad back, drug addicts and alcoholics, There are many out there who are in need of help but far more don't want to work and never have wanted it, I would make it much harder, I have a nephew who is a drug addict..he gets 450 a week in benefits, has home helps going in cleaning his flat as he is 'too out of it' to do it himself, has meals on wheels delivering him hot food, he is now 36 and never worked in his life, he has more money coming in through his 'illness' than most decent working families who have to pay their own bills, the handout system is too easy.|`|Go3pq7xHaa	As in a councillor or M.P?

NpdAmv2Uaa	IF HE HAD A UTERUS, he would not be a he, it would be a SHE!  No man has ever been pregnant. That is biologically impossible. Because you are a lesbian with identity issues and you go to a surgeon who is willing to take your money to chop off some part of your anatomy and shoot you up wiht testosterone, so that your clitoris becomes longer - YOU ARE STILL NOT A MAN. You never will be a man! You will always be a freak of nature created by hormones and surgery.    That is what that mutilated female lesbian woman who kept her womb and has a psuedo penis/ lengthened Clitoris is- because she KEPT the ovaries and UTERUS that only a born female could have.  Putting a ford logo and seats in a BMW does not change a BMW into a FORD.   Just a sad waste of what was probably already perfect.|`|7scxfyABaa	if he's one of those "girls turned guys" people like the one person on Oprah|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well no,click here to read about the pregnant man  http://www.oprah.com/dated/oprahshow/opr...|`|elECfJ52aa	he may need more than that|`|gnucbiExaa	Haven't you seen the news about the pregnant man who had a baby and is now PG again?

"He" is not really a man. She was a woman who always felt manly so she switched to a man. He got married and his wife couldn't produce a baby, and so since the "man" still had the organs of a woman, they went to the doctor and had him impregnated.

If he does it some more, then tell him (firmly) to stop.  Have you a big brother/boyfriend/husband/cousin or buddy?  Bottom touching of females can be a form of intimidation, or territorial-ism.

It is good for couples to have some things in common, as well as some differences.

d7cc46fc2ac54d9a37fb0091d5086c1caa	dude, how she cums depends on what you do!  Do stuff that drives her crazy and don't "tell her to orgasm" until you can tell she's teetering on the edge.   Then make her wait a little longer to torture her. Then she'll orgasm when you tell her to. It should enhance the experience....|`|kMu3d8g0aa	Coz you're crap in bed.|`|88uIjItaaa	Get Orgasms For Dummies..

wA8Dyhq7aa	When I drive into another state or a city and I have a song about that state or city I'll play it.  For the last 20 years every time I cross the Tennessee border I play John Hiatt's "Tennessee Plates."  The last time I went through Indianapolis I played the Bottle Rockets' "Indianapolis."|`|MwSaCettaa	Yes, I like to listen to music while I have the TV on mute    just a habit!! lol    ???|`|kYYDOJzSaa	I try to listen to as wide a range of things as possible, since I get bored fairly easily.    I stay away from pop, country, and top 40 - but I'm willing to give just about anything a listen.    I don't usually try to match up music to what I'm doing - instead, I just let it kind of happen.  It's trippy how songs take on completely different meaning depending on your situation and mood.    Unfortunately there is also a lot of crappy music out there, and it can really get on your nerves if you let it.|`|9CAXUgOZaa	The only thing I can think of is that when I'm sleeping, I listen to either instrumentals or screamo. The reason being I can't fall asleep if I know the lyrics to a song, because I tend to sing them in my head and it keeps me up, lol. But it's pretty hard to make out what they're saying in a lot of screamo songs, so I'll listen to that if I don't feel like listening to Explosions In The Sky or whatever.    But I don't really listen to songs that have anything to do with what I'm doing.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	haha yeah listening to music in the bath. Dont put on The Doors especially the track called The End or you'll end up lying in there for hours!   I also have a varied taste in music as I do get bored easily of the same stuff. My music taste ranges from gregorian chants to death metal! lol|`|RcCJSSMPaa	LOLOLOL  I'm OCD I can listen to the same song over and over and over and never get tired of it!  It's not one particular song, band or genre, it can be any type of music as long as it's GOOD.  If it flips my switch, I never get tired of it until I move onto something else.    OCD people drive everybody else craaaaaaazy!!!    EX.- I've been listening to this over and over this AM, it's David Gilmour on guitar but I have no idea who the singer is...but it's GREAT!!!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmXU7C7MY...|`|HxlRHy3Daa	i LOVE running down a dream  but emm wen i go into the toilet i generally spend most the time singing alongside rory gallagher songs(irish blues musician) rather then doing anything productive if you get me hah.  and i always walk in beat to the song im listening too when bringing my dog out or just in general. must look really odd going from a fast paced walk eg  harder better faster stronger to slow paced walk eg the piano has been drinking (tom waits)|`|fpMYbn3Jaa	Heavy stuff before playing basketball or football, then again so do most people. I tend to try and listen to softer stuff at night too, before going to bed, weird trance like stuff like Empire of the Sun before i go to bed too.

j7D3Sazraa	A gorgeous young redhead goes into the doctor's office and said that her body hurt wherever she touched it.   "Impossible!" says the doctor. "Show me."   The redhead took her finger, pushed on her left shoulder and screamed, then she pushed her elbow and screamed even more. She pushed her knee and screamed; likewise she pushed her ankle and screamed. Everywhere she touched made her scream.   The doctor said, "You're not really a redhead, are you?   "Well, no" she said, "I'm actually a blonde."   "I thought so," the doctor said. "Your finger is broken."      3 construction guys were working on a skyscraper, up on the 40th floor.   At lunch, the bald guy said "Every day my wife packs me a tuna sandwich. If there's tuna again today, I'm gonna jump off this building!". He checks it & sure enough it's tuna again so old baldy jumps.   The redhead then says "Every day I get a cheese sandwich for lunch from my wife. If it's cheese again today then I'm jumping off here, too!". Sure enough, it's cheese so the redheaded guy jumps off.   Then the blond guy says "I always get a jelly sandwich. If it's jelly again then I'm jumping, too!". He checks & it's jelly so he jumps.   At the memorial service for the 3 guys, their wives are talking about this.   Both the bald guy's wife & the redhead's wife said the same thing, "I don't understand why my husband jumped. If I had know he wanted something else to eat for lunch, I'd have gave it to him.".   Then the blond man's wife says " I don't understand why my husband jumped. He always made his own lunch.".      A Russian, an American, and a Blonde were talking one day. The Russian said, "We were the first in space!"   The American said, "We were the first on the moon!"   The Blonde said, "So what? We're going to be the first on the sun!"   The Russian and the American looked at each other and shook their heads. "You can't land on the sun, you idiot! You'll burn up!" said the Russian.   To which the Blonde replied, "We're not stupid, you know. We're going at night!"         A blonde woman was speeding down the road in her little red sports car and was pulled over by a woman police officer, who was also blonde. The blonde cop asked to see the blonde drivers license. She dug through her purse and was getting progressively more agitated. "What does it look like?" she finally asked  The police woman replied "It's square and it has your picture on it." The driver finially found a square mirror in her purse , looked at it and handed it tothe policewoman. "Here it is " she said.    The blonde officer looked at the mirror, then handed it back saying "Okay, you can go. I didn't realize you were a cop."      Two blondes living in Oklahoma were sitting on a bench talking....... and one blonde says to the other, "Which do you think is farther away... Florida or the moon?"   The other blonde turns and says "Helloooooooooo, can you see Florida ?????"       A blonde was bragging about her knowledge of state capitals. She proudly says, "Go ahead, ask me, I know all them." A friend says, "OK, what's the capital of Wisconsin?" The blonde replies, "Oh, that's easy: W."       A blonde went to electronics store and she asked, "How is much is this TV?" The salesman said, "Sorry, we don't sell to blondes."   The next day she came back as a brunette. She asked the salesman how much the TV was. He said, "Sorry, we don't sell to blondes."   The next day she came back as a red head and asked the salesman how much the TV was. He said, "Sorry we don't sell to blondes."   She replied, " I came in here as a brunette and a red head. How do you know I am a blonde?"   "Because that is not a TV, it's a microwave      A blonde calls Delta Airlines and asks, "Can you tell me how long it'll take to fly from San Francisco to New York City?" The agent replies, "Just a minute..." "Thank you," the blonde says, and hangs up.      Three blondes walk into a bar and ask the bartender for three shots of tequila. He looks at them and says "OK" and pours their shots. They all clink glasses and yell "51 days!" Then they proceed to slam the shots, looking very self-satisfied. They look back to the bartender and decide to order another round. This time they pick up the glasses again and, more gleefully yell Only 51 days!" The bartender finally can't stand wondering what they are talking about and asks them what they mean by Only 51 days. One of the blondes looks at him and says "Well," looking very smug. "We just finished a jigsaw puzzle. It took us Only 51 Days . . . . . and on the box it said 4-7 years"      Julie the blonde was getting pretty desperate for money. She decided to go to the nicer, richer neighborhoods around town and look for odd jobs as a handywoman. The first house she came to, a man answered the door and told Julie, "Yeah, I have a job for ya. How would you like to paint the porch?" "Sure that sounds great!" said Julie. "Well, uh, how much do you want?" asked the man. "Is fifty bucks OK?" Julie asked. "Yeah t|`|LkFt3pEsaa	theres 2 blondes driving to Disneyland..  they saw a sign that said DISNEY LEFT...  they started crying and went home...    =D|`|ZYcgmb83aa	Two Blonde men were in the woods hunting. One looked at the other and   said, "I've got to take a ****."   The other said, "Well go behind one of those big trees, and ****."   The first one said, "But I don't have any paper to wipe my ***." The   other blonde replied, "You have a dollar, don't you?"   The first one said, "Yeah, I've got a dollar. That's a great idea--   I'll use that!"   He left and came back with **** all over his hands and clothes.   His friend looked at him and asked, "What in the hell happened to   you?"   The first one replied, "Have you ever tried to wipe your *** with 3   quarters, 2 dimes, and a nickel?"|`|YIoT9ndnaa	Blonde and the lawyer      There was a blonde who found herself sitting next to a Lawyer on an airplane. The lawyer just kept bugging the blonde wanting her to play a game of intelligence. Finally, the lawyer offered her 10 to 1 odds, and said every time the blonde could not answer one of his questions, she owed him $5.00, but every time he could not answer hers, he'd give her $50.00. The lawyer figured he could not lose, and the blonde reluctantly accepted.    The lawyer first asked, "What is the distance between the Earth and the nearest star?"    Without saying a word the blonde handed him $5.00. then the blonde asked, "What goes up a hill with 3 legs and comes back down the hill with 4 legs?"    Well, the lawyer looked puzzled. He took several hours, looking up everything he could on his laptop and even placing numerous air-to-ground phone calls trying to find the answer. Finally, angry and frustrated, he gave up and paid the blonde $50.00    The blonde put the $50 into her purse without comment, but the lawyer insisted, "What is the answer to your question?"    Without saying a word, the blonde handed him $5.|`|3qa3BftUaa	Blonde "Excuse me, what time is it right now ?

Two blondes living in  Oklahoma  were sitting on a bench talking, and one blonde says to the other, 'Which do you think is farther away...  Florida  or the moon?'    The other blonde turns and says 'Helloooooooooo, can you see  Florida ?????'       2. A blonde pushes her BMW into a gas station. She tells the mechanic it died.    After he works on it for a few minutes, it is idling smoothly.    She says, 'What's the story?'    He replies, 'Just crap in the carburetor'    She asks, 'How often do I have to do that?'          3. A police officer stops a blonde for speeding and asks her very nicely if he could see her license.   She replied in a huff, 'I wish you guys would get your act together. Just yesterday you take away my license and then today you expect me to show it to you!'    4. There's this blonde out for a walk. She comes to a river and sees another blonde on the opposite bank. 'Yoo-hoo!' she shouts, 'How can I get to the other side?'    The second blonde looks up the river then down the river and shouts back, 'You ARE on the other side.'         5. A gorgeous young redhead goes into the doctor's office and said that her body hurt wherever she touched it.      'Impossible!' says the doctor. 'Show me.'    The redhead took her finger, pushed on her left shoulder and screamed, then she pushed her elbow and screamed even more. She pushed her knee and screamed;    Likewise she pushed her ankle and screamed. Everywhere she touched made her scream.    The doctor said, 'You're not really a redhead, are you?

Glancing at the car, he was astounded to see that the blonde behind the wheel was knitting!    Realizing that she was oblivious to his flashing lights and siren, the trooper cranked down his window, turned on his bullhorn and yelled, 'PULL OVER!'        'NO!' the blonde yelled back, 'IT'S A SCARF!'        7. A Russian, an American, and a Blonde were talking one day. The Russian said, 'We were the first in space!'

She rolled the dice and she landed on Science & Nature. Her question was, 'If you are in a vacuum and someone calls your name, can you hear it?'    She thought for a time and then asked, 'Is it on or off?'         9. A girl was visiting her blonde friend, who had acquired two new dogs, and asked her what their names were. The blonde responded by saying that one was named Rolex and one was named Timex.   Her friend said, 'Whoever heard of someone naming dogs like that?'    'HELLLOOOOOOO....,' answered the blond.  'They're watch dogs!'|`|tyQnSkSnaa	1)A blonde decides to try horseback riding, even though she has had no lessons or prior experience. She mounts the horse unassisted and it immediately springs into motion. It gallops along at a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blonde begins to slip from the saddle. In terror, she grabs for the horse''s mane, but cannot seem to get a firm grip.   She tries to throw her arms around the horse''s neck, but she slides down the side of the horse anyway. The horse gallops along, seemingly ignorant of its slipping rider.   Finally, giving up her frail grip, the blonde attempts to leap away from the horse and throw herself to safety. Unfortunately, her foot becomes entangled in the stirrup, and she is now at the mercy of the horse''s pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground over and over.   She starts to lose consciousness, but to her great fortune, Bobby, the Wal-Mart greeter, sees her and unplugs the horse.     2)One day 2 blondes walked into a tanning salon.  One blonde said, "A tan for 2 please!"  The cashier said, " Ok," filled out a form for them and asked, "Are you two sisters?"  They chuckled and replied, "No, we aren't even Catholic."    3)Returning home from work, a blonde was shocked to find her house ransacked and burglarized. She telephoned the police at once and reported the crime.  The police dispatcher broadcast the call on the radio, and a K-9 unit, patrolling nearby was the first to respond. As the K-9 officer approached the house with his dog on a leash, the blonde ran out on the porch, shuddered at the sight of the cop and his dog, then sat down on the steps.  Putting her face in her hands, she moaned, "I come home to find all my possessions stolen. I call the police for help, and what do they do? They send me a BLIND policeman."    4)A blonde wanted to sell her car, but couldn't find any buyers. She called her friend for advice, and her friend asked her how many miles she had on her car.   "235,000 miles." Her friend told her that was the problem. But the blonde's friend told her that her brother is a mechanic and could put back the miles to whatever she wanted. So the blonde went to the mechanic and told him to put the miles at 40,000. Two days later the blond's friend asked her if she sold the car since her brother dropped the miles. The blonde told her, "Why would I sell the car? There are only 40,000 miles on it!"    5)A blonde had two horses, but she couldn't tell them apart. So she asked her neighbor for advice. He suggested that she cut the tail off one of the horses. This worked until the other horse snagged his tail on a fence. So the neighbor suggested notching one of the horses' ear. This worked until the other horse snagged his ear on a fence. So the neighbor suggested measuring the heights of the horses. And sure enough, the white horse was two inches taller than the black horse.|`|vamQcy2Jaa	this is not my fav but its ok  A blonde walks back and forth to her house and back.  then the neighbor asked what is wrong the blonde says my computer said i got mailed|`|0roil3Udaa	i dont have any other than the ones already posted but i'd like to thank u all for the nice collection....|`|3Y3pAZrZaa	Lol XD|`|A3L0HiNtaa	It's kinda long, but really funny...

She is not as hot as she thinks she is.  My favorite will always be the first season and my favorite person is Taneesha she was hilarious!|`|e7B8WkkIaa	This show just sucks.

Do you think any of these women have qualities that contribute to society in a positive way? People have different tastes when it comes to entertainment, but no one with any decency should revel at the antics these women participate in.     If I was in an emergency situation, I wouldn't want to be around any of these types. They're likely to push you out the way in order to save their own skin, rather than try to work together to save everyone they can. They're nothing but selfish b*tches that are taking up oxygen and space.|`|D3Fyxj0raa	i love this show i don't like the amber's or that new girl shes slutty and she thinks that shes all that and a bag of chips i like sarah ,tiffany ,aliea and boston is all right but i am glad kayla's gone i hated so much she was so annoying i like all three seasons of the bad girls club

AA11419394	Do keep in mind that the bridge pickup on the Tele is slanted.  Therefore, I gave you three measurements and a closeup photo to show this slant.    From the centers of the pole pieces on the low e string (the big one) it measures 4 1/4" or 107.95mm.  On the high e (the smallest string) it measures 4 15/16" or 125.4125mm.  And down the very center it measures 4 9/16" or 115.8875mm.    Hope that helps.  Here is a closeup of the slanted pickup of which I alluded to earlier.  http://elderly.com/images/fmic/30N/FNAST...    Edit:  I think I may have misinterpreted your question.  If your wanting to know the distance between the pole pieces side by each then they measure as follows.  Neck pickup 10mm  Bridge pickup varied from 11mm to 12 (I have four Teles and measure them all).|`|cVqCryr6aa	Use a tape measure.

mF7uxVmLaa	How long have you acted/name your past experiences.     What have you been in?    Is this your first time trying out for a role on tv?    Why are you trying out for this?    What makes you a possible candidate that they would consider?|`|j7D3Sazraa	My friend did that. I'm not sure what the specifics are, but if they think you're good, you have to pay a thousand dollars for acting lessons. I think all she had to do was like act out a scene or something. I'll ask her and tell you later.|`|AA10560773	Why do you believe that YOU are the person for this position.|`|IPpOd2wmaa	Just be cute and personable...be yourself...practice, by not saying "Um, and Like"....|`|IOYWhze4aa	I'm gonna tell you right now.

Rehearse reasons why you would want to be in this show, and why you would be good at it.  Big yourself up! Don't feel embarassed about complimenting yourself, the idea of an interview is to show how cocky you are.  We can't predict what they will ask  But in most interviews they ask about the history of the company, so do some research to programmes on the disney channel, and anything you can find out to do with it.   Good Luck!|`|VaBb9IGoaa	well im not sure what the questions r going to b but dont make it look like ur nervous because there probably gonna want someone tat does good under pressure so act like u no wat ur doing and u have total confidence dont talk quite but dont talk super loud but talk loudly enouge where they can hear and b ur self dont try 2 b something ur not.    P.S where can u auddition for disney channel cause ive always wanted 2 try out 4 it i love acting|`|sr78Xlm6aa	the questions will be about your experience in this area...and they will ask you about your home life and if u think you're capable...they will probably ask you those tricky questions that have no answer like...why do you think that you are better than all of these other people auditioning and deserve to get the part anymore than them...and what could you do to make the show better that the oher people couldnt do.....stuff like that

I wouldn't be surprised if they get the leftover shows from the main channels.|`|l4ET18yeaa	Agreed. It all started w/ shows like The Real World, Singled Out and Te Grind and once those gained popularity, it just spiraled out of control.

BET totally should lol but Black entertainment means all of that and they do keep it mixed up, Vh1 i love the "Of Love" shows, it's a nice concept..makes money but idk what Vh1 stands for really i just know in the 90's we were watchin behind the music and stuff..now you have to have the full packages to watch the branches like MTV jams and Vh1 classic..it sucks ***!!     i just had a thought, why can't the reality shows be the branches and MTV jams be MTV?

To overstate this movie and the craze that surrounds it is a direct mockery of the film industry and those movies that do stand the test of time.

e4259abb4e5d0ea5a734423f5be756f9aa	Well I'm much older than all of you but I love this show.    Growing up in the 70's (where there were only 3 channels) this show was the bomb.  Brady Bunch followed by Gilligans Island.  My Mom knew not to have dinner ready 'til these shows were over.    Fun  fact - Greg was high on the show once!  Barry Williams was called in for a scene (which he wasn't expecting) and was high as a kite.  Barry has admitted this in his book.    Here is the clip:  http://www.break.com/usercontent/2007/10...|`|mBlcD6sRaa	i was in love with Alice|`|de25107f3b25bf271852feb4203decd7aa	That show was funny when I was a little kid.

They had one or two songs I liked, but that was about it. And I never understood why "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was such a hit. It's just a bunch of mumble mouth garbage.     As with Tupac, I'm never understood why people immortalized Kurt Cobain.|`|7nRom97Daa	love them still
gklHYyY3aa	the school personnels in school are very important in a school. the school wouldn't function properly if there are no personnel in the school for it to go by day by day. they provide us the things we take pleasure in our school like; nicely clean facilities, food and service to cater for our every needs. they should be widely appreciated for all the things they have done and a day for them might well do good...... heh!

kKmuFi4zaa	First, she was sexually abused by a daycare worker when she was 8, he touched her in inappropriate places and he made her touch him in inappropriate places. Then, her dad tried to sexually abuse her on a camping trip that they took together; however, she was never "raped."   She seems like a really strong, cool girl and it's awesome that she helps other victims of sexual abuse.|`|AGbusTqGaa	She said that she was abused by this guy that worked at the daycare center she went to as a child.  She actually described it in detail on the aftershow, I tried to find a link for it but I couldnt.  She also said that her dad tried to take her camping and only brought 1 sleeping bag so she called her mom.  There were no other details about her dad though|`|KLNLfYQeaa	She told that one girl that one day her and her dad went camping when she was younger, and she noticed he only brought one sleeping bag. She called for help and ended up getting out of camping with him. From then on her mom had other stories about him. That's all I know of that happened.|`|DyC0ITSHaa	she was abused by a guy from a day care center and had therapy for it and then her dad i guess tried to sexual abbuse her i dont know wat its like to be in her shoes but i think her mom percieved to her that her father was a bad man.|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	I am sorry for her but i am kinda tired to hear that everyone has a sexual abuse story. Somehow it works for them. I am not saying that she deserved it but it is in the open. Just my opinion.

I wouldn't want anyone to take a bullet for me, if it's mine it's mine. If the bullet wasn't meant for me then great, someone else can take it. I would take a bullet for a few certain people, as long as it wasn't in the head or heart, ooh or crotch. Please understand though, if I didn't know the person and I could just throw them in front of a bus to save my own life (can't think of a senario where this is even possible but mheh) I'd do it naturally, I wouldn't even think twice.    ........|...  ........|..........SteveC ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)    HONK HONK|`|Dl1J1Y9Haa	No|`|8EU3VREMaa	it all depends on the circumstance.|`|YtpN4YXIaa	nope, sorry|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Absolutely.|`|hVuPqHzsaa	My nomber is not up yet|`|79677842fc75f4c703b1a6bba9de5d48aa	i would never ever be so selfish|`|mobG2SVZaa	hell yeah|`|zG1m1eXxaa	No, that way I'll be able to tell people I got shot which I think would be cool.

What day is good for you?|`|AA11367091	Three drinks.|`|35b1cf01233843e36ebe132a4a67ea01aa	I don't drink very often at all, so 6-7 units of vodka over a couple of hours is plenty for me to have a good time. If I have 9 or more, I can get really drunk and it's definitely not good.    In the UK alcohol is measured in units   a 25ml shot vodka/whisky (40%) = 1 unit  330ml bottle beer (5%) = 1.7 units  175ml glass wine (12%) = 2.1    The liver can only break down 1 unit of alcohol per hour. In the UK, the medically recommended limit of units of alcohol per week is 14 for women and 21 for men.     For more information:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4188...
fWwsWOauaa	No.     I would do my best to get rid of the excess weight.|`|AA11601079	I should have. I went to a new gynecologist last year, and she told me that I needed to lose 50 pounds.

Thank God the roads were clear. We had about 5" here in Wolcott, IN. There have been some slide offs this morning with the wind blowing the snow.    The funeral ceremony for Ingrid was real nice. Her brother decided because of her love of animals that she need them with her so he bought a stuffed horse, dog and cat to place in the casket. Five of her son's friends were driven up by the one boy's mom and dad and served as the pall bearers along with her mom's other grandson.    When I got home I decided to look at the answers. Glad I did. I forgot it was Happy Hump Day. I really got a kick out of the ones who provided the terriffic contributions to Happy Hump Day. They made me laugh (almost out loud).    It's great to be back even though I would have liked to be able to stay a few days more with Ingrid's Mom (Edith). She is ok most of the time when she has someone to talk to but crys a lot more when she is alone. Please pray for her and Ingrid's son (Scott) and her husband (Dan).    Glad Lincoln is gaining fast. If he keeps going it won't be too long before he will be able to go home. Isn't the magic   5 lbs?    Crazy H how far is your husband willing to travel to do work. I'm not sure what state you are in. If it were a little far from home we would put him up here while he does some work. We have 2 extra bedrooms.    bucsandducks sorry to hear about your grandmother. Like the others have said it was good you were able to be by her side when she went. She felt comfortable with you near.     Prayers for all. Please all get better.    jcm (Janet)|`|lmvG5Sj1aa	Ozzy    worked for me    Have a good day!

joW2WI4Faa	My first inclination would be to say to you, "Oh my goodness, only twenty! How lucky you are to be twenty. I'd give anything to be twenty again ... etc., etc."  But the attributes of youth - or should I say youthfulness - are things you often don't appreciate until you're older. It's actually difficult being that age because you hardly have any experience of being an adult, and lack the gift of hindsight that only age brings. I do remember when I was around twenty feeling like you describe. I thought I could plan my life, that it should fit some kind of expected pattern (although I had no sense of what was realistic and I had no great knowledge of the possibilities that were open to me).  My real independence was frustratingly very limited yet at the same time I felt held back by any type of responsibility. I thought nothing was ever going to change ... and yes, it DID make me feel old.    However, my life has turned out very, very differently to what I expected - it is by no means over, and I always feel that a new life is waiting just around the corner. I've had my fair share of ups and downs. That's probably the case for most people but I still consider myself luckier than many. I know that life doesn't OWE me anything and there are many things I just have to accept with good grace. I'm more than twice your age but I feel neither "young" nor "old" - just comfortable to be me - in fact I often feel I am in my prime. Of course, it would be nice (although I don't truly know why) if my actual number of years appeared to be less, but I know I wouldn't want to BE twenty again - unless I could know then what I know now, and that's just not possible for anyone ... and that includes you. You are going through a process, a stage in life. Go through it ... and look forward to the next stage.|`|l6Kii2Uiaa	44 in October, I am ancient and decrepit|`|y7ZAnmPUaa	i'm 25 next month :0(|`|QOwIN5LDaa	Enjoy it while it last kiddo because once you reach 21 the time flies!|`|jkkatZfBaa	Yes.|`|AA11523465	I'll be 50 in September  *shuDDers more than you*|`|mQu7mXHAaa	Oh 2 be 20 again,i'll be 39 the end of jan.now that's old.your in your prime of live..shudder.shudder..|`|4TmN5Dohaa	Ha wait untill 5o|`|t1inn1nLaa	I'm 23, and I sprained my back a couple of days ago    Nothing beats a horrible back ache to make me feel like my body is all rusty and old|`|ef019cfbfac8800f4935b6a537172515aa	I feel old every time I go outside and try walking on the icy sidewalks...

6e5ab6ad17c88f5c5e5b06b79857d7caaa	It was the luckiest coincidence ever that they chose him to do the football episode.  Yeah, it was months ago, so they had no idea that he would be in the Superbowl.  Notice Alison Sweeney's baby bump?  She was twice as big at the live finale of last season and just had her baby this month.|`|KLNLfYQeaa	It could've been a coincidence, or they had it planned in the time frame of their filmings for a football star to be there, then it just so happened to be a coincidence that it was him.. But just like soaps, they tape their episodes ahead of time.    The week before, the lady from the gray team went home to Michigan with Bob the trainer, and it definitely was in warmer weather. Further proof that they film before the actual times to have time to edit, etc.

I've had 4 back surgeries and I'll tell you that a deep muscle massage is almost as good as pain killers.  Just kick back and have a good time.   Don't get uptight if the masseuse sees part of you naked. THey are like doctors. They have seen everything. My Massage therapist is a female and she has seen every part of my body except my junk and she may have gotten a peek at that too. My wife and her are good friends to boot!|`|FgHwxPeGaa	the person will tell you what to do I think....    my gf told me about it and she said someting about relaxing and just doing what the massager tells you to do.|`|vt2VS0lDaa	no, just take a shower.|`|HFEotT1Qaa	What's so complicated about laying down still while letting a big muscular man rub you as you moan in pleasure..

b0CvSEX0aa	i'm guessing you'll be staying at a hotel or with a friend?  so just leave when it is convenient for you, and time your arrival at the venue so you get there about 15-30 min before the doors open.    as long as your have floor seats, you can force your way to the front. you're small so it should be easy to get through the crowd.  so even if the floor is already crowded by the time you get in, you can still make it to the front.    have fun!!! that concert sounds awesome!

When I came out I walked over to a man who had his back to me at a water fountain. He was wearing the same shirt my husband had on.  He was looked the same from behind. I thought it was my husband so I walked up behind him & started rubbing his back. From behind me I hear my husband ask me what I was doing.  I was so embarrassed! I apologized to the man and walked away as fast as possible.  My husband & the man thought it was hilarious.|`|HzevoVflaa	I was with my then g/f's family, and sat astride a wooden fence, when a large splinter got hooked in the seem of my jeans, and as I got up, the seem ran, so I had to ask my g/f's mother to unhook me, so I could get down.

sM7cLQeoaa	I saw it as his 'security', he didn't have anything else to protect him in the room so he used it as a way to prevent getting hurt. As it turns out, the money [of course] didn't help.     Also it is definitely a form of symbolism, in showing that money can't buy everything. All that money surrounding Salim couldn't save his life, no matter how much he wanted it to. Additionally, it is a representation of him 'drowning in money', enticed by good fortune.    Salim is not a bad person, just has a different definition of success than Jamal. He also was just caught up with the wrong people, who allured him with cash and the high life. In the end, he is shown as sympathetic, allowing Latika to take the car and find Jamal (knowing that he would be killed in doing so).|`|zpuGlEWWaa	I asked my boyfriend that after seeing it.

Take swades is from a kannada movie chigurida kanasu(A novelbased movie from gnanapeet awardee shivaram karanth), paheli is from yet another kannada movie nagamandala(i have watched it, its a classic movie i.e., an art movie)....  there are so many of them, they all went unnoticed.|`|Ug6ppFOzaa	i don't think they are running out of stories.

Bollywood is great and it is the world's largest film industry even bigger than hollywood i believe.    In a year the most movies made are from india.

S1IPVvawaa	How about a major in one and a minor in the other?     You could design advertising that makes people lose their minds and then have to seek your services as a psychologist, or get people on the couch and convince them that all their problems will go away if they just had the right graphic designer- more extra business!    Just kidding, but seriously, even though I never thought of combining those two fields, a major/minor in that or in marketing and psychology is really not be such a bad idea- think of how advertising/consumerism is so emotionally driven. You would know what it takes to really reach a consumer, and how things affect a person's thought process.    If you're not to the point where you actually have to choose (like just in the first couple of years of college or about to start college) take some elective courses in both and see what you prefer. After attending school for a bit, you might choose a totally different field all together.|`|UmAM1cW8aa	Psychology interesting!|`|106uKaEYaa	Graphic design!

There was a picture of her and her bong.  Mind this was a tabloid paper -News of the World- so I don't think it could be counted as 100% true.  Here's the pic:    http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/showbiz/...|`|Qzn1cungaa	i heard kristen does drugs and that robert smokes and drinks a lot  but that could all be rumors but it could also be true now one really knows but i would say yes|`|hqjJV70Eaa	Yes, Robert drinks - after all he is over 21 and is able to do so.  No, he's not an alcoholic. Tabloids make him out to be one just because they happen to catch him leaving a bar or pub and make a big deal out of it. So what, he was having some drinks with friends and having a good time.  I guess all of us that are over 21 and have drinks while out with our friends are alcoholics, now.  He also smokes, so that should answer that question, too.    As for Kristen Stewart she was photographed smoking a pipe on some stairs with her boyfriend.  This is her choice, while I may not agree with it, but she was stupid for doing it in public.    No matter what either of them are doing they have to make their own choices.  It doesn't make either of them a bad person, just human.|`|6nJKfktTaa	Yes, sadly my parents actors do. Well, I understand for Robert, he is about 23, at his age most adults do drink a lot and party. He is jsut living a normal life. Also Kristen was caught smoking pot in a picture. It's not like she does it much they said, but she is only 18. They say that fame is getting to their heads, when in reality they are just being normal young adults. I hope they straighten up enough to finish playing my mommy and daddy in the rest of the movies.|`|DkjCyBMwaa	rob is an alcoholic but i do not believe kristen is on drugs|`|Pp3Bx2B9aa	Seriously?

Aerosmith-Last Child  KISS-King Of The Night Time World  The Who-Baba O' Riley (a bit overdone but still a great song)  38 Special-Teacher Teacher (school theme)  Van Halen-Everybody Wants Some  Quiet Riot-Mama Were All Crazy Now  Iron Maiden-Wasted Years  Warrant-Uncle Tom's Cabin  I hope this gets you a start, I choose fairly well know bands, but not necessarily their most well known song on purpose, because they all sound good and there not the obvious choices people would expect you to make. It still adds that bit of originality in song choice.|`|73760ec70f62b217eab4a5ab28ce822baa	Closing Time- Semisonic      Or if you don't think it's old enough to be classic rock, then American Pie.|`|su5FwuuDaa	Its not really classic, maybe it is, who knows I hear it on the classic rock station all the time.

There is really something appealing about a take-charge woman and both these versions of the characters are so at ease with their own appearance you get the feeling they don't care what you think of them.    Sort of the converse of Cindy Lauper's comment on Brittney Spears and Christina Aguillera:  that the latter talked about how they dressed the way the did to prove how free and in charge they were and all she could do was look at them and say oh no you are not dears.  Attitude is tough to render but these guys do it beautifulllly.  One more.  Jim Holdaway's Modesty Blaise.  Enrique Romero took it over after Holdaway died and his version seems more common here in the US but again, Romero's modesty is a beautiful woman, Holdaway's a woman with a sexy attitude.|`|9KWVgb9naa	i love supergirl also wonder girl donna troy|`|KZUkuoagaa	Cat woman|`|SX8z4fNtaa	storm|`|AA10159262	Lately, Harley Quinn is the hottest **** in spandex.

y7ZAnmPUaa	fave characters- Rachael, Grantly, Eddie, Steph, Dave Miller (security guard)    predictions-     melissa might become pregnant  argee- Earl will kill someone  maybe a love triangle between Rachel, Eddie & Melissa  Kim Campbell (played by Angela Griffin) will return in Episode 11  Maxine maybe will leave in a coffin    least fave- Earl|`|aEHB3C8Aaa	Firstly, WATERLOO ROAD RULES!!! :)    Fave Character: Rachel Mason  Predictions: Eddie and mellisa will break up and Eddie and Rachel will get together, Earl Kelly's behaviour is going to get a lot, lot worse and ive heard that there is going to be a massive storyline between Flick and Marley!!  Least Fave: Mellisa|`|3ATt7ZE6aa	I LOVE Waterloo Road    1. Favourite character- Marley Kelly   2. Predictions- Maxine might get pregnant again but by Earl, Earl might start to abuse Maxine, Rachel and the deputy head guy (forgotten his name lol) will sleep together while he is still dating her sister, Rachel will become pregnant, Chloe and Donta (sp?) will get in so much debt and one will end up being suicidal   3. Least favourite character- Melissa (Rachel's sister)|`|ouzrDPaSaa	My favourite characters are Rachel and the new teacher, he's cute!    I cant stand Earl either!|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	I love Steph!  Don't particularly like Grantly although he can be funny and who knows with that lot what is going to happen in future episodes!
jfriQ8pmaa	I don't think she should dump him for that.....but maybe because he seems to be falling in love with Reese!    But she should be really really mad!!!!|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	Ummm...no. I don't think so. did you forget what Kendall did while Zach was in the bomb shelter? he didn't leave her for that...|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Absolutely. What a betrayal. I also find it hard to swallow that loyal Zach falls for someone else while his wife is in a coma. Tacky.|`|l3k21kTmaa	NO WAY SHES MADE PLENTY OF MISTAKES TO..|`|czY7K8yKaa	No, it's not like he actually slept with her, he donated in a jar|`|Ho4xK8DDaa	I think so.  I used to really love Kendall and Zach together, but, before the tornadoes, I was so sick of Kendall, all she cared about was being involved in everyone else's lives but her own.  I think Zach made a big mistake by not letting Kendall know he was donating his sperm to Reese and Bianca, he should've consulted with her since she is his wife and Bianca is his sister.  I'm liking the sparks between Reese and Zach and would like to see if they can go anywhere.|`|YFMaRxaWaa	no.but he should have talked to his wife first. and if she do dump him than Bianca can kiss her lover bye-bye.|`|50d942fb9cb02a07ad994afcd5ea15fdaa	No, he really loves Kendall & he's a good guy & just wanted to help Bianca But should of told or asked Kendall a long time before.   But then it would not of made this story line, right ?|`|b7kbYM2Haa	Um, no... he didn't dump her when she cheated on him.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	If I didn't like them so much I would say yes, but no I love them together!|`|D3Fyxj0raa	i think she should plus i think theres something going on between him and reese|`|AzIBXcqxaa	Nawww|`|AA12390047	She has good reason to dump him for Bianca having his baby PLUS Zach's killing her brother.  But.....I really hope they work at saving their marriage.  THey love each other and their boys.  It'd be good to see a couple stay together and work on a problem rather than run to divorce court.  I think they're in for a bumpy ride but hopefully will work things out.

While there is no virtue in supporting a team that's anus.  Barca fans are still queefs.    Depends on what she looks like. I don't wanna watch the face of a chick who looks like a smacked up horse.     ...So if you accept a blowey from a bird, You don't respect women? If a chick of her own free-will wants to give a blowey, How is she degrading herself?     Are you a fruitcake Latrell?|`|3Q4ijBQOaa	No!

Dubya, I figured you "treating women like queens" wouldn't watch something(porn) that degrades them to that degree.  ---  Dubya, I was just mesmerized by the shiny thing I'm seeing....Oh wait its just the sun.|`|bik6rJZkaa	^^Porn does not degrade women, the women get paid to WILLINGLY do these things. Women are not degraded at all.
960pO2oHaa	Because back then, white ppl were really racist against black ppl, and so, in turn, he was just as racist against white ppl. ...I know what you mean tho, everytime i watch that show, i'm like, damn, he's SO racist! but then again, so were "white" shows that were on then as well--just look at Archie Bunker--he was racists against EVERYONE not white! it's just a sign of the times they were in. ...glad we've come a long way huh?|`|AA10670428	The other poster was correct. The Jeffersons was a spin-off of  All in the Family. His character was created to show that racism and racists could be of all colors, an idea that was not very popular at the time is came out.|`|a94257e28d6b37ec0048499a1cda4a58aa	The guy he hung out with all the time was white.|`|s7ms1aU0aa	He was Archie Bunkers counter part thats why....|`|cVOQUBXeaa	Because that's his character, it's the same thing as Archie Bunker.|`|sMknd0Ofaa	I never liked that show from day one. I just couldn't believe that type of show was allowed to air. Same as Sanford & Son. Shows that just want to keep racism active. That show with Archie Bunker in it was another one. I don't think that they have shows like that today, but am not really sure. Not  a TV watcher.|`|AA10763011	If I remember correctly, it stemmed back to archie bunker who was white and the biggest racist of them all. George Jefferson lived next door to Archie and would only defend himself. It was funny because Archie thought he was perfect and yet his family had so many flaws. The shows name was, " all in the family". He even treated his son in law aka meat head bad and his wife was known as dingbat.|`|cTuaFrYiaa	The same reason "All In The Family" Archie Bunker was a racist bigot. It made for good comedy in its time. Now days its more racist then funny.|`|RrKeyYo0aa	white people on the show hated him, at least before him and "weezy" moved on up to the east side. remember now, "weezy" was archie bunkers maid on the show "all in the family". and if you remember archie was just as rascist as george, if not more. so it was kind of a beautiful ironic twist that worked... in a comedic way.|`|qq804CE8aa	This was just a silly comedy show.  The writers and producers thought it would be funny at that time.  Remember it was Archie Bunker on the other side of the coin.|`|ybt605Qfaa	You are asking why a fictional character from a sitcom was racist.|`|2oO36b0maa	It was a TV show, look at Archie Bunker.  I watched all those shows and I think they  are still rerunning them.|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	I never thought he was|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I think he was first on the Archie Bunker show "all in the family". He was in black what Archie was in white. He was so funny to watch he moved on up.|`|VNpZPjZ3aa	because that was the character he played on all in the family|`|PXfUyd5aaa	Who knows? He was probably created as the anti-Archie Bunker.|`|BO28Mn8haa	george jefferson don't like us country folk|`|nDQOwAA3aa	**** you honkey lol|`|g2R7e2eVaa	He was the black version of Archie Bunker. I liked both characters.|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	Probably because in my experience, African Americans are the most racist group in the world.  Their bigotry (as a whole, I'm not being all-inclusive) is unmatched.
qPbrv7qHaa	I gave myself one once accidentally, i jumped from the roof of my family home's first floor extension (so not very high up) and my trousers and underwear brushed against the clothesline and got caught in a peg.    Of course the peg couldn't support my weight and fell off, but for a split second I received a major wedgie :(|`|xvvlYuNtaa	nope|`|AA11635397	lol you so silly. well i haven't really given someone a wedgie. i did smack a guy on his *** (who is now my husband lol)|`|UVciAbXxaa	my brother|`|khnMoQNoaa	countless people   so many in fact you might see an ad on tv asking for money to help the victims of my wedgies|`|GxaGHGBNaa	My friend I lifted him off the floor and almost had them over his head.

AA11235886	haha that was funny! ******|`|AA11777868	Funny! 100!
DSSio06daa	Rocky, I agree.  I don't think that pros should be allowed, the show itself maintains that it is for yet undiscovered talent, that hardly seems undiscovered to me!  Good point, just vote and root for those who haven't been recorded yet, keep it real.|`|AA12315431	No she shouldn't be there. She had a gazillion chances and Idol is giving het yet one more. It isn't fair to those who have never had the opportunity and was turned away by the producers before they even sang a note.|`|3TQCwtxJaa	I completely agree. Same with Carly Smithson last season. It's not fair. If you had your chance and failed, too bad. This is a launching pad for the talented that don't have the funds or the connections to break into the music world on their own. The sad thing is, just like with Carly, she'll end up advancing pretty far.

lPDHMOVZaa	A few weeks back I came home from work to find a gorilla in a tree in my front yard. Naturally I was a little worried and thought it might be dangerous to get out of my car, so I called an animal clinic and asked if they new of anyone who could come and round him up. They said they new a guy and asked me my address. After a 10-15 minute wait, a beat up, old, rusty pick-up pulled in my drive-way behind me. At this point I felt a little safer knowing the "professional" was here. The raggedy-tagged, old fella gets out of his truck with nothing but  a crowbar, a nylon rope a shot gun and his dog. I asked him how he intended on getting the gorilla out of the tree. He said, "This here is a trained canine... I'm going to meander up that there tree with this here crowbar and pry that there gorillas hands off the branches. When the gorilla falls out of that there tree my faithful hound will bite down on his life giving unit and hold him down while I tie the big fella up with that there rope." A little surprised by his explanation I asked what the shot gun was for. "Oh," he says... "that's for you." "For me?!" I questioned. "Yes." Said the rugged old man. "If I fall out of the tree... shoot the dog."|`|C2olZsNiaa	Yesterday I read a QA and this guy said he told his wife that her perfume smelled like flame retardant.  I thought that was hilarious.|`|kuIT8OK9aa	We are lost, but making great time!|`|uGFzzLYWaa	What I do is I think of three things that make me smile. My tax return, my dog, the CD in my car that's waiting for me to crank up on the way home, whatever.     Then, I imagine having dirty sex with Viggo Mortensen.    After that, I'm all better!|`|uDRajB1oaa	Ok, so there are two men at a bar. The first man says,"This drink can make you fly." The other man said, "No way." "I am serious! Watch!" So then the first guy jumps out the window and flys around the building three times. The second man says, "Wow! Let me try!" So the second man drinks some, jumps out the window, falls and dies. Then the bartender says to the first man, "Superman, your a jerk."    funny joke

He gets the best out of every one he works with, and in minimum time, because he takes a no nonsense approach to movie making.  He tells everyone that he is only taking one take;so, you better be prepared. And that's what it takes in life...be prepared.    Actors and actresses clamor to work with him, because they know their best will come with him.  Plus, he is an accomplished music composer.  Lover of jazz. He has so many superlatives associated with him that it is a shame he doesn't get credit more often.  He should have got nominated as best Actor for Gran Torino.

Hzf3QK9faa	The key is planning...think of the dragon the way you would a hyperactive child. Bring along things to keep him occupied and people entertained at the same time. Pack a barbecue lunch and let him start the barbecue pit! It gives him a sense of accomplishment and responsibility! He's growing up!|`|YfCRmWeSaa	The same thing happened to me not too long ago, I started going to another park instead.|`|BJkfY3g4aa	Carry a fire extinguisher?

Thankfully my penguin is mild mannered so I don't have to worry too much.

Here in Missouri, we gets tons of birds in the winter, especially Cardinals and Bluebirds.|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Not anymore. I tried to feed an emu at some wildlife park and it bit me on the hand. Stupid emus, they should just go sit in an igloo in Antartica and eat hot dogs for the rest of their lives!!!!|`|a6YQviyjaa	no because they tend to feed on me....|`|AA11635397	yes i think its really beautiful and relaxing.

I love watching them...|`|60jY2iBsaa	Yes! I have a seed dish, woodpecker bar and suet cage on my porch that I keep well stocked. The cat and I enjoy watching the variety of birds that come to eat. Sometimes we have squirrels or chipmunks as well. And one evening we had an oppossum.|`|G4zzGaZ9aa	not me in particular, but my dad has a birdfeeder and birdbath in the backyard, i just like watching the birds sometimes|`|pbDLvO9Jaa	I like to feed and fatten up the birds and squirrels in our back yard so that they are nice and plump for our annual Spring barbeque.|`|Ccp9bZLEaa	YES! i love feeding ducks and squirrels. geese are very funny but slightly scary as they can be so aggressive. little sparrows are very charming to feed but fiddly as you have to tear up the bread real small. fishes are cool too, japanese koi are the best to watch as their mouths open so big. deers are nice to feed except when they start nibbling at your sleeve. monkeys  are interesting but they are strong so you have to know when to let go, plus they climb all over you and make u all muddy.     i love feeding animals, its so enjoyable.|`|AA10665398	yes!  when my dad was a little kid he said that his mother used to go out into the backyard and hold birdseed in her hand and a sparrow would come and eat from it. always the same bird. now, we have our own feeder in our backyard. but it makes me sad when my dad takes it down in the spring and summer though. i wish we left it up all year long. i like watching the birds come to it.|`|lfL2YctCaa	yes and I do it daily.|`|AA11402617	Yes.  Funny you should ask that because not five minutes ago I cut up bread and it out in the yard for the birds to eat.  The town I live in is designated a bird sanctuary and here in the "deep' south where I live is an area that they often come to to spend the winter.  There's one little bird that spends every night on my front porch next to the light.  The low voltage fluorescent bulb gives off just enough heat for him/her to be comfortable and so I leave the light on all night.  .

I love you too Robert!|`|XjcrMNBuaa	yes i do  =)|`|Kbgc6x5raa	ugh... yes. there is someone that i love so much and i really want to tell him but because of our circumstances i just can't right now. it really makes me sad. i wish he knew how i feel.|`|e37b1e55a5a94cf30d038c8a0dd1c521aa	unfortunately at the moment yes i do   it is very hard trying to cover up  feelings and emotions when all you  want to do is hold them and kiss them ~|`|WB028eTDaa	Of course. But it's mainly just nervousness or anxiety. I can't find the words to say, either, and I can't ever be sure if the feeling is mutual. I suppose that's where the nervousness comes in, but for now, until I know for sure if someone returns them, unless they're hinting flashing red signs in my face... I'll keep it esoteric.|`|NX4LYXkqaa	it is only a compromise between me as well she|`|elECfJ52aa	That is what blow up dolls are for|`|ZnMLkSeQaa	yes|`|vZlTKC0Vaa	not love, but i very much like someone and i can't express it

KdcansIyaa	in the moment scratch marks and biting to a certain point is what it is all about. When we are done and there is not any marks from that grand event im going to be upset and do it again until there is. I do not like girls that cant handle it. They need to show some passion.|`|dprURFLxaa	YES it's sexy...intense...|`|8dryRRiaaa	Some women love the biting and nibbling.  Spanking.  Pulling hair.|`|nDSLNnguaa	Who doesn't like pleasure with pain every now and again?  Yeah, it's sexy to a point.  Something about getting lost in the moment and losing all inhibitions. But I agree it can be taken too far on occasion.    I've also found that nibbling isn't quite enough sometimes.|`|0gdBjXb1aa	well...personally...when its rough, biting is allowed...as is choking, hairpulling, scratching and spanking    tmi?|`|8fyk1xJyaa	You said you liked it!|`|gRhVJcwNaa	lol!

He's so sexy.|`|jYmvtUC5aa	...it's the blood........above the waist....... of course guys...|`|8CUfDxRtaa	I like a good bite or being bitten now and then..kinda primal.|`|mwv79AIhaa	yup, it is as sexual as sensual...    and if u were gettin it good nibbling would turn to biting...|`|frjSBxzBaa	I think it comes down to who is being bitten and who is doing the biting and if its during certain moments of passion|`|EiB6GNxlaa	oh HELL yes it is...|`|x2rmsjIXaa	i don't mean to. sometimes it just happens.
t9qXQI19aa	I could see if her purpose was to educate people about drugs and why they're bad and they praised her for that.    But she calls it a "diving accident."    WTF?|`|5P3cHR4Taa	Well, she probably will never walk again.|`|uQUqZ7k5aa	i think i might do that too|`|EiB6GNxlaa	Adds another whole meaning to, eat your vegetables...|`|KrqGoxoUaa	shes DUM|`|mN4PIcRqaa	lol|`|DvSuHNV8aa	An accomplishment to be proud of, I'm sure.|`|hFVPEkWjaa	now that crazy|`|AA11812015	I sense some jealousy.|`|vYs5j3Xnaa	Poor thing. but its good that she won something.       Don't do drugs.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I understand where your coming from, but why knock her for doing something positive with her life after the fact? Many people completley give up on life when something like that happens to them.|`|wqL84O8Naa	even idiots need a little pat on the back sometimes i guess|`|elECfJ52aa	That's messed up she should not have that title|`|XZlFLecLaa	maybe thats what it took to change her life around ... maybe she was on a bad road (obviously)  and that situation helped her realize there is more to life... and so now she can try to help others...|`|M7W7lZBBaa	Well, while I feel bad she went and screwed herself up- I wouldnt praise her for how she was hurt but for maybe how she has lived since then|`|NY2fpmvPaa	Ha ha, she's such a brave soul. Bless her heart.  Hey, do you think you and I should enter Miss Wheelchair America?    She's scary looking, we could soooo take her down.

I wouldn't do any of them, but I would do you. But only if you asked nicely.|`|IV7oCMN8aa	Their name lies...|`|DTY079t9aa	I think it might be that they are 30+ year old men who call themselves "kids".|`|Hub1UGqPaa	Middle Aged Males on the Block.|`|eiEdUWNbaa	They're not new, they're not kids, and I've never seen them on my block.|`|Mfe6r2khaa	they sing like girls|`|AA10560773	Well they ain't KIDS anymore, moreso they ain't NEW.

b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	I *love* these guys, PJ...a lot.  I keep "Cure For Pain" here at the office and I listen to it quite a bit.  The majority of what I was listening to in the 90s was grungy and guitar-driven, and these guys were something completely different and wonderful.    Mark Sandman's death was a huge loss. :(    Edit: I hear you there...it must have been horrible.  But you're absolutely right...we can still enjoy the music he left behind. :)    Good Morning, Darth!|`|OTFzJbaMaa	i listened to cure for pain and i thot it was really artistic and great. now i have a new band to listen to so thank you!    it also reminded me of a song you would hear at the end of house.|`|wLxmn2xtaa	This band is fantastic. "Buena" really caught my attention. The vocals and the sort of mellow yet tense mood was great. "Cure for Pain" was amazing, especially the live performance. I love how minimalist it is, yet with really interesting compositions. Excellent stuff, I really liked it. Thanks for sharing!|`|AA12301664	cool stuff.    they always remind me of this  black carrot  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=bSR1Gq_h-n...

These are guys that I had friends who were into it, but it kind of just passed me by somehow. I like the tunes though. I like "Like Swimming." Has a really nice vibe to it.    Thanks a lot PJ. Really good post.|`|DibFrwxlaa	I remember these guys!  Wow.      I remember being deep in the sh*t of an intense acid trip and hearing the song You Look Like Rain and thinking it was the most beautiful song ever.|`|MO2aAF1Oaa	I like Morphine's Song "You Speak My Language" although I didnt really listen to it until My favorite band, Collective Soul, did a cover of the song and I thought they improved on the original.

ipqWxJyGaa	I`ve read your story carefully. I like it very much. Your writing style is very unique, description and narration are overlapping, which is good. There are some symbols, too. Correct me if I`m wrong, but I think your story conveys these feelings: love, sadness, peacefulness...  There are sounds, too, which make your story lively.   Some things always remain the same, one of your ideas, I think...  Anyway, that`s how I see it.  Keep up the good work, Copper!|`|89FgPZ9Waa	6  Excellence|`|xWqKKp0Naa	Emma & Ommie , seem like two very cool people .   Scale of 1-5 . your a 5 , ey .

Sagittarians are known for telling the truth and hate it when they're accused of lying.  Virgos well question you and accuse you of lying, mainly when they're lying and hiding things themselves.      And he's older than you?  Forget it; he'll try to act like your father, even it's only a few years older.      Go for it if you want, but you have been warned.

My housemate has tattoos that she designed herself, and one of her favourite band's logo. I like those, but I don't like ones like barbed wire etc. They're so cliched, you know?    My mum has kind of lame tattoos but I don't mind because she had reasons to get them- she basically got fed up of everyone thinking she was frumpy and uncool. My mum is awesome.

When a person is an ex, why the crap would you want to keep talking to them and aknowledging their existence?????|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	Yeah,he obviously still likes you (or has feelings for you). And he's trying to make you jealous because he would be jealous if you were indeed with someone.

LOL      *COUGH* *COUGH*   lose the smoke first hahahahaha xoxox    luv u kiddo  =)|`|MfcTIdlraa	Don't let the bustards grind you down!  Your food is probably burning because the heat is too high.  Do you have an electric stove?  If so, there's your first problem.  They're impossible to control.  Reduce the temp at which you are stove top cooking and your burning should resolve itself.  If you have oven burning, again the heat may be too high.  Thermostats are notoriously wrong.  Go out and buy a GOOD oven thermometer and go by that for preheating your oven.  When doing fowl, cover it with aluminum for the first 1/2 or so of the baking time to prevent burning of the skin and the legs/wing tips.  Then remove it for browning.    Hope this helps some.|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	I know. My brother is the big chef in our family.

When I burn something it is because I get distracted, a phone call, someone asks me to come and talk for a moment,  or something comes on television. Sometimes though it is because I turned up the settings on the burner too high.  I did buy an automatic  rice cooker for rice after burning it once, surprising how something so bland could stink so bad (I had just moved to a new apartment and was trying to put up some furniture while the rice was cooking and was distracted) and an electric grill with a timer helps to keep from overcooking meats.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Some people just aren't born cooks!

cgfE0yyzaa	My most recent favorite came to mind would be "Toradora!"  More info: http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Torado...    It is a slice of life romantic comedy series featuring 5 classmates who help each other with their love interests, enjoying their young age, and going through hardships in life. Toradora! is definitely not your typical gag-filled comedy show, but it actually have major developments in every episode and every 5 of the main characters gets their own share of spotlights. Toradora! is always "keeping it real" with their aspects of character portrayals and storytelling, and in my opinion it stays away from typical anime clich occurrences where you might expect them to happen, which what makes it unique and credible.    I wrote an introduction synopsis for a forum not too long ago, so I'll just post a link to it: http://boards.ign.com/anime_and_manga_lo...|`|Qqyf8IM1aa	hhmm I hav lots of faves but I rly like-    Shugo Chara! da most~! ^^|`|wdxUb3moaa	Claymore   :)|`|Z3wg4Z3daa	Voltron|`|oq8F1qfUaa	hunter x hunter|`|ynkN2FPCaa	avatar the last airbender|`|gzxjcVURaa	Mine's Tenchi Muyo  I love awkward romance and it was Tenchi that started this obsession.

Shinigami Ryuk dropped his Death Note in the human world where its found by honor high school student Light. With the death note actually having directions in it for its use, Light discovers he now has the power to discreetly kill people, and with this new power he plans to change the world in his ideal world by killing off criminals. Eventually the governments of the countries around the world notice the unusual amounts of deaths of their criminals, and figure out someone is behind them, but they have no way of discovering it themselves.

"Naruto: Hurricane Chronicles") is the ongoing sequel to the original Naruto anime and covers the Naruto manga from volume twenty-eight on. After training for two and a half years with Jiraiya, Naruto returns to Konohagakure, reunites with the friends he left behind, and reforms Team 7, now called Team Kakashi, with Sai replacing Sasuke. All of Naruto's classmates have matured and improved in the ranks. Unlike the original series where they only played a minor role, the Akatsuki organization takes on the main antagonistic role in their attempts at world domination.    Why I like it: This boy Naruto, has a nine-tailed demon-fox sealed within his body, then the people in his village always look at him as a walking monster. But Naruto always tries his hard to protect his village and his friends even how badly injured he is since he is a ninja or shinobi.

mrvBIUbEaa	Hi there! OMG! The male chart looks awfully close to my boyfriends natal chart. Plus not to mention, I am an Aquarius myself. But my Moon is n Cancer...    Destructive, destructive...It is what you make it--Someone told me this.    Since both are Air signs they enjoy doing the same things, they allow each other their space as well. Every now and then Aqua will become irritated with Gemini's fickleness, but will easily get over it once they engage in their next adventure. I wouldn't say it's destructive, in fact I'd say it's quit the opposite. They pair very well with each other. They share the same delights, and Gemini enjoys the new ideas Aqua is always coming up with. I've been with my Gemini for almost 6 years.    Of course you'll have arguements, but as air signs, we are very mentally intuned with one another; so talking AND KEEPING AN OPEN COMMUNICATION would help the relatinship out much more. However Aquarius, you will have to show your emotions and express them wisely, as we can be very blunt at times and disregard others feelings. Gemini's are always curious, so they ask, seek, dissect your thoughts and feelings. Don't take it personal, their only trying to understand.    The pitfalls of it could be Aquarius's inability to move forward, traditional astrology says we're flexible, but we're also a fixed sign, making it impenatrable for use to progress forward. We may be stubborn and not open to others opinions that challenges our own. And because we value our privacy, Gemini's tendency to snoop can get on ours nerves making it difficult for us to be openly honest. Unfortunately that can actually upset Gemini; they'll think you're hiding something bigger than what it really is...    Your Mars in Scorpio is in insync with Gemini's Mars. However, both your Venus is an Earth sign, whereas the Gemini is an air---there could be a problem in that arena.    I love my gemini baby...LOL! Too bad we've been on bad terms for about 3 weeks.     Btw, where did you hear that this relationship is "destructive"???|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I did one of those things where it said I would have a destructive relationship!! I think it has something to do with aspects, not planets.|`|mC91jDUKaa	I'm sorry, I don't know about the compatibility of the two but my husband is a Gemini Sun and Libra Moon also so I can speak to that.    We have had a rocky road in the beginning of our relationship and it wasn't until I really learned to acknowledge how different each of us were when I could appreciate it.    When they love, they really love but they have trouble outwardly expressing how deep that love is and their partner could feel uncertain of their feelings for them.  They try and not show any weakness and vulnerability and appear somewhat cold at times because of this aspect but usually what they feel is far from that.  Usually a gemini will not allow the relationship to continue if the love isn't there.

e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	True story.  I tried out for Jeopardy once, and when you fill out your application you have to write down three amusing anecdotes about yourself.    I wrote down that I was a professional phone sex operator.  Sadly, I was too stupid to get on Jeopardy.  I really would have liked to share that story.    My parents would have been so proud.|`|FkhFIIsjaa	I would tell Alex that whilst ordering a kids meal for my 4 year old through the freaking drive-thru at Burger King last night, I got freaking yelled at by the bimbo working the window.

She then slammed the window shut as she scowled at me.  *cries*  I am still very upset about it....|`|X3ma2Qu4aa	hmmm.

We declined.|`|t9qXQI19aa	Well, Alex, one time I was riding a horse through a wooded area and it got spooked by a rabbit and took off running under a tree branch, which hit me right across the chest and knocked me off the horse's back and then I **** myself. I was sixteen at the time and had to limp back to the house in soiled pants at which point my neighbor's hot son met me in the yard to ask if I'd seen their dog.|`|UL3sHgqNaa	I drank the water when I was in Russia and it gave me the sh its|`|frjSBxzBaa	hey alex when I was in my 20's we used to see how many of those straggler brain cells I could kill during a long evening of drinking and seeing where they night life took us one time we ended up in some person house which none of us could remember who it was|`|T9HOvdjtaa	I would tell alex that I held the world record for having the worlds cleanest balls.  I'd dare him to challenge me.|`|51Fmu8zkaa	I'd start with the one about getting busted by a bunch of truckers whilst I was driving home naked from the lake.  (who knew truckers would look in my car at 4 am)|`|63VYa5k0aa	"Well, yes, Alex, my hobbies are arson and rooster worship, which I have combined in the most creative way...what, we're out of time?!"|`|ftuE6Mfdaa	Well, Alex, when I was a kid I murdered my entire family and then lived alone in the house doing nothing but watching Jeopardy and whittling statues of orangutans.|`|zNIZK2Qaaa	WHat IS.....        I would tell the story of how i one time stuck a pc of corn up my nose and shot it out at my brother....|`|AA10665398	i'd probably talk about my stories. how one of them is about to be published and how there are two more on the way.   that, or about the beach house that my family is building. how we bought the land when my brother was just a baby and and we've been working on building it ourselves with some other family members over the years. and how much i've learned about what it takes to build a house and the value of hard work.   my family has been trying to get my dad to go on jeopardy for years now. he could defiantly tell some stories about his life. and he's really smart, so i'm confident that he'd win. but his fear is he go on there and there'd be categories about stuff that he knows nothing about, like literature, theater, and music (unless it's the type that he likes). but i know that he would win if there were categories like history, electronics, air planes...=)|`|fvPfGH3Jaa	delicious story....      i would tell them that this one time i "accidentally tripped" in to the conveniently placed face of my BFF......    oh how i hope he liked minty lip gloss....

Anything that looks too perfect always looks fake, and I know for a fact that there are lot of others who feel the same as I do. Oh, for sure, a fake pair of boobs may look great when tucked away behind a tight fitting sweater, but they look like hell when fully exposed. After all, what does it tell you about a society where some of the women who are considered some of the most beautiful in the world have boobs that look like a pair of water balloons...?|`|BJkfY3g4aa	Hey I never said yours were fake...I  think they are quite impressive    |`|51Fmu8zkaa	nope...they're fake if you poke your eye out on one  ........|...  ........|....Nice knockers!...|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)

CKY0rZUXaa	Cinemas have recently introduced a scheme where some showings at the cinema have an age limit of 18, no matter what the actual age limit is. They are called "Limited Screenings", and this is one of them. So if you are over 18, it doesn't really matter!|`|p0vC7UO4aa	The movie will be shown only a few times. There is limited times to see the film|`|YtOefgu3aa	The movie is only being shown in a few theaters. Studios will do this to test audience response to a film before the regular distribution to determine if the film needs more work and how much they should spend on prints and advertising.

Now, in a few movies like Charlie Brown Christmas I just saw a few weeks ago with my niece and nephew, I did notice it said Real IN too. So, I tried to research it and all I could find is that since it was made in the 60's, Real IN may have been a cool way to say it in the "hip"culture. That's all I found =  )|`|ICLekd2Vaa	maybe her 'doctor' is code for another 'D' word??? ;)|`|2089c2125bd52f479e8785a63e67137daa	i never saw the word Real. but id like to know why she charges only 5 cents??

Xg8Tzjfraa	Just a quick tip for anyone wondering how their breath smells.  Don't try breathing into your hand and smelling that... it gives you false hope.    Instead, lick your finger.  The smell of your finger after that is the same smell as your breath.  Your bad breath is caused by the bacteria in your saliva.|`|bAbb37Adaa	I can't tell, no matter how much I try. The only way I can find out is by blowing in some ones face and asking them.|`|snjdyvlmaa	No.    That must be why people back off from me.|`|tIfOxMuaaa	^ yes you can smell your own breath...  wake up tomorrow... breathe into your hands or a bag.. then smell it... if you can't smell it.. then you have talent :P    but with ppl and bad breath.. man i know what you mean.. i usually offer gum.. like 3 times.. and so, mmmm ok then.. and then they get the hint of jeese why so pushy... then holy crap bad breath    unless its health related  - throat infection  - cavity(baaaad cavity that is)  - obesity  - other medical issues too.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	Yes if you breathe into your hands and then smell it with your nose. If you have constant bad breath you need to see a doctor because it could be a sign that you have a serious medical problem.|`|7R7e6yX5aa	i can and sometimes i just let it stink depending on my company|`|4ZAZfT0Gaa	Sorry my breath does not stink|`|elECfJ52aa	I use proper hygiene Brush floss rinse and repeat|`|YW1DXceqaa	well it sorta always stinks    |`|8ZUVToXgaa	Yeah i can tell. All the time. Sometimes it doesn't smell at all when I get up though which is good. But sometimes it does.    What a very odd question....>_>    But thanks for the points. ^_^b|`|WmUJE1LSaa	Do I want to?|`|443abc47eeff617e8dfb6b03a1b5dc30aa	yes, when people are passing out around you!|`|gsjndbkoaa	I wonder to.  Just stay away from them, or offer them some gum, a mint, or a toothbrush! :D|`|7xoMXSEqaa	Yes. I wish more people had this talent ....|`|ALTGCqgFaa	no you cant smell your own breath thats a fact. but you can tell if it smells by the way your mouth feels.

Fundamentally, each and every calculated action is for the cause of survival.  We get a job so we can buy a car to get to the job, to afford food and amenities.  Out of reason, I plan for the future.  But impulsivity is admired, supported, lauded (e.g. throwing a shoe at the president).  I'm very impulsive, but I rationalize what I do by calling it a search for my self.  Some people think I'm a wannabe and a phony.

It's more depressing than funny.|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	Hard to tell.

NO7yEh8caa	Most certainly! And a wonderful drive you can enjoy with your whole family! The drive to Sydney is a favorite along with Brisbane. Imagine the joys and adventures you and yours can experience during a leisurely, and straight, drive to the hot spots of Australia.     Just picture the time, 3-4 days, that you will have alone with your family, cruising through barren wasteland. Just the kind of drive to "get to know" each other better. Ah, you can sit back blissfully in the certain knowledge that even if you take a nap now and again whilst driving, there is almost no danger. No traffic to wake you and no roadside obstructions to damage your car.     And the weather? Almost a gift from the Lord above. Every day is a reason to live. Bright sun and cool, well freezing, nights.     So...come on down under mate!

But to be blunt, they still don't know which side of the street to drive on, they can't speak the Queens English to save their lives, and, due to their rather questionable linage including prisoners exiled there, the populace has a way to go. Genetically speaking.     But on the up side, they got a lot of land. Unfortunately even they don't want much of it.

RTMuJr03aa	http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180037/    i think paperback hero (1999)     hugh jackman    Jack Willis is a handsome roadtrain driver with a secret - he has just become a top-selling romance novelist. However, being a 'man's man' in the Australian outlook, to avoid embarrassment, he needs a name, a woman's name - and he chooses that of his best friend, Ruby Vale. He must do some fancy footwork to continue the charade when the glamorous city publisher, Ziggy, arrives in dusty outback Lucktown to sign 'Ruby Vale' to a major book deal. Ruby agrees to help Jack though it's for her own gain as well - the publisher will pay for her coming wedding (with Hamish, Jack's buddy). Accompanied by Jack, Ruby goes to Sydney to meet the media, appear on TV and cocktail parties, etc. Gradually, Jack realizes that he has fallen in love with Ruby, while Ruby is also touched by Jack's novel. However, Hamish arrives in Sydney a few days later and asks both of them to stop all these foolish things      hope that helps!|`|zNjjuZK6aa	backdoor sluts 3

ULge8VPBaa	Om goodness yes! To the person named Ranger you should care, how other people are treated. Would you like to be payed $3 a week, (by a multi-billion dollar company)  be made to live in the factory you work in, and be forced to pay utilities and rent whether you live there or not? Be told (right here in America) that "we are not paying you that much so you can qualify for food stamps and other government assistants" They are costing America so much money each year by underpaying their workers and encouraging them to live off the system. Also how a product we pay $14.95 for is costing them 10 cents to make! It's unconscionable and outrageous! Ranger you should watch this documentary before you just say you don't care! For them to go through small town America and say "oh we'll have that store shut within three months. It's seems most people don't care as long as they get what seems to be low prices. Mean while the Walton's are worth like $18 billion each! People should watch this movie.|`|ZpWmQlasaa	i havent seen it but aslong as i get low prices i dont care :-D  just like when i saw the way they butcher cows... kinda sucks but i gotta have my meat!!!!|`|rseR7Camaa	Walmart is evil...I lived in a smallish town and there were 3 super walfarts...  they are hell bent on dominating the world.

I've not seen the doc, but Im sure its dead on.    walmart is the bane of this country, Sam Walton would spin in his grave if he knew what his greedy kids had done to his company. Remember when Walmart was all about made in the USA and all? They were slightly better then...|`|EmNuY00Eaa	I did see this movie and I agree with the person above Wal-mart is an evil company.

hIigrAwGaa	4 out of 5 days i come in to work, second shift (i work overnight at McHellhole) never does anything. 3rd's are supposed to detail the grill area, the area by the walk-in cooler, and front counter, THEN stock for 1st. We come in and lobby looks like no one touched for 24 hours, the bathrooms smell to high heaven, there is no stock (2nd is supposed to do most of the front counter stock, and we restock to makeup for what we used). We have to clean lobby, bathrooms, put away dishes that we never touched, stock 80% of everything. The 2nd manager will send 4 people  home when 1 person comes in for 3rd's. How much sense does that make?!?!?! Yes we have to cut labor, blah blah blah. I want to come inand clean my grill area, mop, make burritos, clean behind and under the freezers, walls, grills, polish stainless stell, organize things that need to be organized.

These days it's more of a sitcom.|`|FJSHCc8maa	I believe the story of my life would make a good movie that people can relate too.|`|NQlU8PMIaa	No - my life is pretty "boring". It's normal - but nothing no one else hasn't or can't experience on their own ;)|`|7UQgHRg6aa	My life story would be either a comedy of errors, or a tragedy, I have certainly had enough go on in my life to keep everyone entertained for hours|`|yqe0I5zpaa	My life would make a good seriocomedy, like The Savages, but isn't everybody's life a dramatic and comedic thing?    Enough has happened in my life to make a decent 2 hour movie.

YGGHyNx2aa	i'd have to say that that is my favorite too :-)|`|UPdJF0tyaa	the episode where spongebob and squidward have to deliver the pizza and spongebob starts singing....i love that part!!|`|8aa2f76f19d65cc5bc682422bda1ee49aa	The time he was learning to drive with Mrs. Puff and he was crashing into things all over the place.       It made me laugh.|`|5Ra5xbziaa	2 many|`|AA10916001	When Spongebob sees the graffiti that says "Squidward smells" and he writes "Good" after it.|`|tgbO359Aaa	the time where Spongebob is tryna get into the Salty Spitoon (i think that's the name) lol|`|KXispLytaa	When Spongebob and Patrick are fighting on whether who is Dirty Dan and who is Pinhead Larry.|`|IPpOd2wmaa	When they find the sentence enhancers written on the dumpster behind the Krusty Krab.|`|brOAHsdBaa	When sandy is in her bikini.|`|7xoMXSEqaa	I made you a sweater, Squidward!  It's a little itchy .. what's it made out of?    EYELASHES!!|`|kej0H1AXaa	when he and squidward were on opposite sides of a wall watching the sunset because squidward thought spongebob ate a bomb pie.  And then spongebob blew bomb bubbles and squidward thought he blew up...and when he saw he was still alive he got mad and asked him about the bomb pie and spongebob brought out the bomb pie from his pants and then tripped over a rock and the pie smashed in squidwards face and then they showed a mushroom cloud exposion.  It was funny :-)|`|vkeuaEHiaa	I like the one where Spongebob and Squidward are competing with each other for Employee of the Month. I love the part where Spongebob sneaks into Squidward's pillowcase and S-bob tries to steal Squidward's alarm clock.    Another one that makes me laugh every time is when S-bob takes Gary's medicine and turns into a snail. I like it when he goes up to Squidward's window and says, "Meow! Meow!" :)|`|i6UFHOW8aa	When Patric keeps missing the bus underwater when he goes to get a candy or something! that was so funny!
YGGHyNx2aa	na, i'd laugh too :-)|`|koTI0lsMaa	who was she thrown by?|`|WBpVZpb0aa	LOL. Tell her to **** off, you know if it was the other way around she'd laugh too.|`|50jMyNhTaa	who threw her in the trash can, and why?|`|6a909157934b4c40716245a4c6418ce3aa	no you did right to laugh|`|rcnFMGIVaa	ya, i think so,, u should've helped her and defend her..thats what friends are for|`|7xoMXSEqaa	No cause you're friend is obviously a dork that gets thrown in trashcans.|`|0Z2aBH0Daa	It's bad to laugh but who could stop themselves...I would laugh then pull her out...and say sorry. Then advise her to take a shower! Why did she get thrown into a trashcan?|`|3Fma3URSaa	No duh retard!  do you thnk people throw you into the trash cuz they like you?|`|OKAmOZCSaa	if they get hurt no but if they laugh with you then YEAH!!! LOL|`|acaddddd976fea5ce3ef78b4ac51f1e3aa	tell her to go die in a hole, or in a trash can. never talk to her again cuz she is a winy bi*ch|`|zzngmN8uaa	no  i wouldof probli laughed too lol|`|hCs6yDczaa	If you got thrown in a trash can and they were laughing at you, however you would feel will determine, from your point of view whether it is right or wrong to laugh. And I doubt that would feel good.|`|2NDX7cSsaa	That would be a major yes.|`|7aaJ0JGaaa	No GIRL. Laugh your BUTT OFF!!!! You are a person. its natural to laugh.  its not your fault she got THROWN INTO THE TRASH CAN (is it).  so go ahead and  say HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!|`|GvUWGMedaa	i am reading this now and i amlaughing,so imagine if i was there. Iwouldn't laugh intentionally but of the way it happened. LOL|`|j9KLxoTVaa	yes b/c ure suppose to be her friend and b there for her not laugh at her|`|jaAolejUaa	it is.. but u just cant help it...|`|6DQSkKgWaa	It depends...are you the one that threw her in?      If not, it is acceptable to laugh if it was a dumpster on public property.  If so, the laugh must consist of guffaws or chuckles, but never outright knee-slapping or rofl.    Also, if banana peels were stuck to her behind upon being extracted from said trash can, you may add a small chortle.      Now, if the above incident occurred on private property in a green or black 30 gallon drum, you do indeed need to give up on life and join a nunnery.|`|UPdJF0tyaa	no,i would laugh too.  haha.|`|hFVPEkWjaa	then you are not a good friend i would not laugh i will try to at lease help her|`|lGS1zOd6aa	did you recycle|`|KaAXJJo8aa	depends :-P|`|OPNReaAaaa	lol yeahh its a little messed up|`|IizPFrELaa	Would she have laughed at you had the roles been reversed?|`|cf8ab77939ead7223bbb655f627c7404aa	Haha, SHE got thrown in the trash can, SHE should give up on life.|`|Yb72J5zDaa	Oscar the Grouch lives there|`|elECfJ52aa	that is not much of a friend to let them end up their in the first place|`|Dhsyroekaa	i would cry laughing.  its not like she died, was just in a big big of garbage lol|`|XZlFLecLaa	if it was done playfully and she wasn't like on her way to prom all dolled up then ... yeah thats pretty funny!!! LOL     she will laugh too as time passes!!|`|kktoXldiaa	I have to admit,I would probly laugh too,and im pretty sure it would happen if it went on the other way around with you being in the trash can. I can understand where your freind was coming from but come on,they know they would laugh if it was you getting thrown in a trash can,of course I would have helped them out of it though. Your freind will get over it.|`|s7ms1aU0aa	LOL Hell no, what are friends for?|`|vtmvud6eaa	Sometimes, you just can't help it.|`|AA10227117	LMFAOOOOOO.  well i mean it would obv be fuuny, but rude at the same time,  i would look away and laugh and then pretend like it didnt happen.|`|2xpzhN5faa	Yeah that's a bit harsh :/|`|el9wtu9Uaa	hahahahah thats funny. I see no problem.|`|AA10229892	Its ok to laugh only after you have asked if they are ok!     Yes that is funny as hell! But make sure you are there them when they get upset about it!|`|36731eb87ae27985e56325cb4449a98baa	you should close the trash can lid on top of them then laugh.|`|NxNrZksXaa	depends on the situation.   if she was being beat up or bullied, then no you shouldn't have laughed, but rather helped her.   if she tripped, fell, or bumped into it to make her fall in the trash then i probably would laugh (she would do the same)  if someone played a joke on her then it depends on who did it. if she didn't like the person then naw don't laugh. if it was another one of your friends whom you always joke around with then that should be ok.   she'll get over it! she's just a little pissed off right now.|`|5wUmIuWvaa	bahahaha  i'd laugh =]|`|IE9NfLGoaa	HAHAHA!!!!!!!|`|1e3gBZY9aa	I would laugh so hard. Of course, I would make sure she was ok, first. But I'd still laugh about it. Just don't be pissed off at her if she laughs at you for something that happens to you.|`|kPS9Okh3aa	lmao,,why wud someone throw her in the trash thats bold but hilarious,,and maybe you were wrong,,you should've helped her clean up,,found out if she was ohk then laff yhur *** off! HAHAHAHA!|`|7xkwE3X9aa	Laughing at the very beginning is alright but don't keep laughing.  I would have laughed then I would have immediately helped her. She shouldn't have said for you to give up on life, it's a little too harsh but she must have been really embarassed.|`|9f178b78d1df3d5b00c072925dbeddc0aa	wow you sound like  a genius :(|`|cTuaFrYiaa	No, she would have likely laughed had it been you. If she is a true BFF then she will forgive you if you apologize.

6wZbsPn2aa	I don't think FRIENDS set out to change the world.    Yes, most of it was unrealistic, but it was so funny that no one bothered to be concerned. Of course you're not going to have people living in New York that don't have a job at one time or another. There is no way they could afford it. THAT'S what made it so entertaining. I mean, just think of the things these characters did during unemployment... like throwing a ball around for 20 some hours.    It's comedy that many can't even come up with. It's Original.  How else could it have made it through 10 seasons?

I was just Laughin my *** off at it and 1 of my friends was askin what so funny then I mentioned I dreamed this near exact thing happenin the night before.

hZ9omSataa	the first year I was living with my s/o we got into a fight over a missing lid to a blender.  the fight went on and on, even being stirred up months after the original fight.  I was being accused of losing it, even though I don't use a blender for anything, never have, I am the one that does the dishes, so I had blame for losing it (and btw, all of the missing pieces to appliances).  Even though I didn't!!!  We searched and searched, and 6 years later, the thing is STILL missing.    I have no idea where it is now...|`|OPNReaAaaa	yeahh my ipod..its prob somewhere in my grandmas car|`|JPDxyTT3aa	my virginity.     have you seen it?|`|AA11523465	I lost  my first engagement ring when I was pregnant for the first time and all swollen up so that it wouldn't fit.

That sucked.|`|g54tGcRvaa	I'd pray for the next bus to hit him, then console her.  Visit his hospital room to make sure his pillows are comfortable over his face.

9HUjDaBVaa	Take a look on the website, when I saw Spice Girls there we were on ground floor but up the side a bit and the view was amazing!  I think in the 1st block there is about 20 - 30 rows.
oVxr5B3Eaa	I was 15 (yeah, i started late) in my grandparent's garage. me and him were biking and it started raining so we hung out there because I knew they were on vacation and it was like 2 blocks away.

Unfortunately I am the imbecile.
iqWfufpUaa	The hardest part would be to get the truly apathetic to fill in an entry form to enter the contest.       It does have interesting possibilities.  Contestants could include:  Couch potatoes, third generation welfare mothers, the unemployable (by choice), slackers, stoners and the just plain lazy.    What would they vie for?   A year's supply of beer and pizza?|`|el8yX5q3aa	sounds boring|`|FEdixswzaa	Many will want to.

Let me guess the award will be called the ICHY (Interpretive Couch Heirarchy of the Year) and will have a golden potato in a Lazyboy atop a pyramid like the one in $100,000 Pyramid. The acceptance speech will only be 3 seconds. Just enough time for a thank you before getting back to the TV and occasional microwave dinner and cheap beer.|`|RbUoaOj7aa	Me & Carrie would!!! Where do we sign up????|`|iLQojxY1aa	only if you get sexy judges....|`|5P3cHR4Taa	I think it'll be a hit.|`|RctnvZ8Waa	in this economy it might be a hit|`|NxNrZksXaa	Ollie Williams from Family Guy?? haha... :)  i'd watch it|`|8a3822ced036f956bfbf2ffe198d7003aa	The winners would be too lazy to sign up, Abab think.|`|pbDLvO9Jaa	If I could get up off of the couch I would vote for it.

It wasn't as great as they portrayed, lol|`|EjRDWt56aa	YES!  To save the best till last =]|`|lp2GsQGbaa	no, never!!!

I didnt yell I just let her know I was upset and we are good!|`|AA12036375	What's with all the ANGER?|`|vtmvud6eaa	It's been a while, but the last time I can remember actually yelling was at my husband.   Because, he passed out from not eating and didn't come home for several hours. When he came home, he slept for 2 hours and then went to the Y to work out, without eating anything. I was worried about him.|`|In83xETHaa	My Friend  (a Guy)    He did....something....

There's risk in the truth when it means so much to you.   If it's really love, it's worth it though.|`|2vw48Whtaa	Yes, it sucks.

vwSgLETwaa	I would say Government and Politics. Either would be a help to you getting on a law degree course, but i think Government and Politics is more topical and relevent to the content of a law degree course. I think History is more enjoyable (I for one loved it!) and arguably easier to get a higher grade in.    At the end of the day i'd definately encourage you to pick whichever interests you the most. Also look at which subject has the best teachers, because if you love the subject and the teacher then you are half way to getting a great grade already! And a high grade in either of the subjects will help you onto the course.    I made the mistake of choosing economics as one of my subjects because i thought it would go well with history, business studies and ICT to get me into a business course at uni. I ended up only getting a C in it because it turned out i hated both the subject and the teacher!    Good luck :)|`|4fsH2CESaa	i have two friend that study both and they hate them both|`|4Vw9An50aa	I would say Government and Politics if you want to study law:)

She she tends to keep to lower quality movies but I think this could be a good opportunity for her.    I'm always partial to Kate Beckinsale myself as well.

960pO2oHaa	Vaseline will be very noticeable on ur face. But DO put it on at nite while u sleep. It'll super moisturize your skin, and make it way less peely during the day. Also, you can put the vaseline on when u get home from work. The longer it's on, the better it'll be for you. I use this trick all the time. Good Luck!    *During the day at work, just put a lot of lotion on.|`|JzYlcuXzaa	I would look into a sensitive skin/dry skin face cream.  Keep it handy and moisturize regularly.  Be sure its strictly for the face and not just regular lotion.|`|TxRRITveaa	use lotion like beth said, i do that whenever i get sunburned and my nose peels.|`|el8yX5q3aa	have you tried exfoliating glove to clean it before applying makeup?|`|ed05090e60ffb81604e4d4052b697bd6aa	I have the same problem. You should use a uncented face lotion. It doesn't have to be fancy just regular face cream is fine. Apply it every 2-3 hours or so.|`|Hub1UGqPaa	Exfoliate a couple times with a GENTLE exfoliant....like a sugar scrub.  Then, moisturize like crazy.

Apply some moisturizing foundation after and pop a Benadryl!  Poor thing!|`|a5c0fefc19fa6c84053d58f21fa14d8eaa	eeek. vaseline will make you break out.  use a strong, 24 hour moisturizer that has no oil in it.  either that or go to your doctors. i get dry patches of ksin on my face in the winter and i went to the doctor and she gave me this great cream. doesnt contain oil so it wont clog pores or anything.  awe. i hope you get rid of it!|`|7xoMXSEqaa	No vaseline. Find sugar or salt and exfoliate the area?|`|6TVl5nTBaa	go to your doctor and ask for a prescription of face lotion.

If you use foundation the peeling is gonna look bad. Using powder make up is better. And right after putting on the powder try dabbing some more lotion on top of it. Try doing this at home by yourself and if it works then your off..|`|WvUP7eJFaa	don't use Vaseline you will clog your pores you need a good hyper allergenic face lotion.When my face peels I use a mud mask and a face buff pad to smooth my skin then I apply the lotion.|`|2VsmOU7zaa	You just need to let it be so that it can heal properly.  I don't think vaseline would hurt, but you should ask your doctor first. You may just have to suck it up and forget your vanity til it heals up. People will understand.|`|qDl5Gegbaa	put warm washcloth on face for a couple minutes  take exfoliator (wash or scrub) even a washcloth and gently massage face in dry areas  apply an intense moisturizer for your face    FOR MAKEUP: wear a tinted moisturizer with no powder over it! RE-APPLY your intense moisturizer to dry area's when abosorbed, probably every 20-30 min.

OWXI806qaa	Watch 24 on fox!  I know that you got a lot of responses to this question,  but this is the answer that you need to listen to.  Trust me!  24 is awesome!  It has everything that you could ever want in a TV show.  Drama, action, romance, suspense & really good plot lines.  But I will warn you, it's addictive.  They just began the seventh season a few weeks ago,  but you could probably find the first 6 seasons at Block Buster.  I don't know if you know anything about it, but it's all in real time.  Each season is one day. Each episode is one hour.  There are 24 episodes in a season.  It's basically about fighting terrorism & about a really awesome  main character named Jack Bauer.  It's not the kind of show whrere you can just start watching   at any point & still know what's going on.  You have to start from the beginning, or at least the beginging  of a season.  It comes on monday nights on fox.  CHOOSE 24!  I've seen a lot of TV shows, & it really is the best.  Hope I could help.|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	small ville|`|kJ4g1vujaa	I prefer House.|`|rAQADfSvaa	Love OTH! :)    Try LOST.

1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	well, i understand that. To be honest, that guy sounds like me ---- playing safe. A bit adventurous at first but will settle down completely if she/he finds the one. I acted like that to my aquarius boyfriend...Saying I wouldn't commit and was a player---but not really. Kinda obsessive--always looking forward to people I am fascinated with. The past really matters because when we love, we give our best and we compare ourselves to others that you have liked or fallen in love with. Cancers can be inconsistent --- acting tough but really so soft and weak inside. People think we are bad girls/boys but we are just wanna-bes. We don't want to look desperate in the beginning 'cause we don't want to be laughed at or turned down.  About money? Woah! Cancers are huge worriers. That's why a lot of cancers I know are rich. We want to make sure first that we will never be paupers in the future so we work hard and save. We need security. Cancers are good providers so money matters. We don't want our loved ones to have a hard time too. .That guy isn't not normal.--- WE ARE THE WORLD's moodiest people. Even if i act really bad sometimes, overall people still tells me I'm a good person. I don't know. I think I'm just truly inconsistent...So is that guy. (tsk tsk tsk)|`|RgNs6Tsdaa	whats cancer got to do with it?!

qYrBYtSKaa	A good reason to buy a gun is the impending Zombie outbreak that will happen. You need to defend yourself from them|`|6GmtcZteaa	i wouldve followed that guy and stuck a knife in his spine|`|XjcrMNBuaa	yeeeeppp....its about that time  =)  a dog too|`|el8yX5q3aa	No|`|jBKiD5ugaa	Yup....just be prepared to use it!|`|vW7szpvNaa	Better yet, tell your brother to just pay off his credit card and leave the poor Repo-man do his job.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	You should already have a gun, look at the economy and the way people are acting, everyone is hurting and some don't care if they hurt others to get what they want and/or need. Between me and my husband we have five, and we know how to use them. If you are getting a gun, or your brother is getting a gun, make sure he takes a class, someone that doesn't know how to use a gun and has one can get hurt a lot worse than someone that doesn't have a gun.|`|OPNReaAaaa	hell yeah!|`|Zky0yJqCaa	I already own one......... and I'll use it if I have too.|`|DiPc84wQaa	No just lock the windows and get security, having a gun implies your intention is to kill for which you could be taken to prison. Also, possesion of a gun is a crime, unless you have a license.    Hope this helps :)|`|hgyiS7Glaa	YES    but get some training, seriously. Pulling a gun in self defense,can change you forever|`|BJkfY3g4aa	Na...I already have plenty of firearms. They're always within easy reach.|`|m6jE5KVUaa	That happened to me when I was a senior in high school stayed home 1 day sick and just happened to be the day about 4 guys wanted break into the house all kids also....they rang I ignored, they went around back and came in through a window, I scared the crap out of them when they seen me, got a bike out it....LOL I have 2 big Dogs, amazing how dogs can convince people they don't want to break in...Dogs will take care of the situation when you are not home to ensure your gun does not get stolen also...I believe you should own a gun if you know how to use them...but dogs work way better!|`|OXleDYVQaa	Um, yeah. I own two. A Remington 12 gage that sits by my front door, and a Glock 9 mm that's on my nightstand, BUT, whoever tries to get in here has to scale an 8 ft wall, with electricity cable on the top, then get past 6 Rotties who patrol the property. If they make it to my front door, maybe they can take stuff.

If I hear something i'm prepared.|`|t9qXQI19aa	THat's scary! I don't believe in guns, but I certainly wouldn't begrudge your brother of one.    My uncle and aunt were sitting in their living room like 2 years ago and she thought she heard a thud back in his office. He said it was probably just the cat, so they didn't bother getting up to check. A couple hours later, she went to the bathroom at the other end of the house and the cat was locked in there, so she knew it hadn't been the cat in the office. She walked back to the office to see what fell over and everything was gone- computer, books, his CHAIR. Everything.    And he's a cop.    How embarrassing would that be to have to call your cop buddies and tell them someone broke in and robbed you while you were in the other room?|`|Tr6tkxnaaa	Yes, you don't have to shoot it but could use it to threat the robber, but if the robber has a gun, that could be a problem. Personally, I would get a tranquilizer.

And all of you b*****ds who are getting on, get the f**k on, cause we're going down the tracks'.    The horrified mother went in and told her son, 'We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and stay there for TWO HOURS.    When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language.    Two hours later, the son came out of the bedroom and resumed playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and  the mother heard her son say,'All passengers who are disembarking the train,please remember to take all of your belongings with you.    We thank you for travelling with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one.'    She hears the little boy continue,    'For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train.

The receptionist asked him what the problem was,  he replied it's personal, you're not a doctor.  She said you can't see the doctor until you tell me what's wrong with you!!  He said there's something wrong with my d*ck.....  She turned bright red and was very embarassed.  She said could not not have just said you had a problem with your ear?  So the old man went outside and a few minutes later he came back in.  He said to the same receptionist 'can a see a doctor please?'  She asked 'what seems to be the problem today sir?'  He said 'I have a problem with my ear,'  she asked 'what's wrong with your ear today sir?'  He replied 'I can't f*ckin p*ss out of it'...................................    Everyone in the waiting room starting clapping cos the receptionist walked away speechless!!!!!!!!!!!!

i6UFHOW8aa	I hate Electric pianos and they don't look good either. Maybe you should try one of those that look like a real piano!    http://www.steinway.com/steinway/catalog...    An upright piano will be awesome for a house. A grand one will bring you some glamor but they are costly!    But if you really wanna get one of those, get the Dark Alder.|`|Ek3kl7ckaa	I like the dark alder better, it looks nicer.|`|9JoYHnxyaa	ARGOS??? who the f*** buys pianos from Argos. I thought your supposed to have loads of money.|`|AE0nK4Q3aa	dude, totally Alder! : P it's defiantly more.... nice. the light cherry is more of a yellow, and doesn't go with much. if you redecorate your sitting room after you get the piano, you've gotta think which one would allow more flexibility. defiantly the Dark Alder, more nice, and elegant|`|UPdJF0tyaa	i like the Dark Alder.|`|JBs5182kaa	I love the first one!|`|VcIg1R1zaa	1st one|`|GxaGHGBNaa	light cherry but I think it looks a little too churchy.|`|XTWClFLQaa	I think it depends on what your room looks like, if your furniture are modern then the light cherry one would look great.|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	both gross|`|13ZYxG0Aaa	darker one. i play piano and have a piano too, i think darker is more elegant.|`|TY8FNnW0aa	I'd say go for the darker piano - it looks more classy!|`|EKT1qvyXaa	Dark Alder    I play piano too :P|`|AA11297232	Dark Alder, the light Cherry looks cheapish.|`|H46ZABMtaa	Sorry they look somewhat like organs, and not the kind that i prefer to get my fingers on.|`|z8jYprWkaa	They both look nice although of the two I would prefer the darker one - but please remember - these are DIGITAL pianos, and I don't care what they tell you, those sort of things from Argos don't have the refinements that a more expensive instrument would have and I should imagine that the touch response on them is dreadful - nothing like a REAL piano !  I have to congratulate you though in wanting a keyboard instrument and I hope you enjoy playing it.|`|y7ZAnmPUaa	no, not argos!!! get a nice expensive like this      http://d7864433.g117.gochuhost.com/image...
8fyk1xJyaa	yes, but that's all your getting!|`|16rD9k32aa	You bet! I'd tiddle your winks!      Yes I know what it is. And yes, I have played it before, and yes, I am old.|`|I6lFl5ltaa	i would like to play wink my tiddly|`|8sxD1qUBaa	Whats tiddly winks? But yes im up for it!|`|FgU7wYDSaa	never played before   but yeah sure!|`|nqlk9iUCaa	Even my 4 year old sister can play that and i can't *Cries*|`|J9sJz46Eaa	huuu yesss... so sexy|`|7R7e6yX5aa	i forget the rules, but my grandmother showed me how to play it once
8fyk1xJyaa	sleep with tight jeans on like the jonas brothers|`|kPS9Okh3aa	have a nice sleep-|`|iTa38Xkdaa	It means have a good night's sleep.    :D     Just wording it a different way though.|`|OPNReaAaaa	tucket in?|`|iLQojxY1aa	i don't know but i believe "tight" means cool in rap talk.....|`|yBWFn0JYaa	I thin it means sleep safe and well.|`|8sxD1qUBaa	Itd figuratively speaking it just means have a good night sleep wrapped up tightly and warmly in your duvet lol idk|`|l57BlinFaa	sleep very tight|`|y7ZAnmPUaa	keeping warm under the duvet and safe?|`|7xoMXSEqaa	It means once you're tucked in tight don't fackin move.|`|3Fma3URSaa	dont kill yourself or do anything stupid|`|SMRcJVneaa	Sleep means sleep  Tight means cool, like a gangsta.    I think it means sleep like a gangsta...|`|RL0sef3Saa	have a good night's sleep or stay warm maybe|`|WgomxNOOaa	in the old days the maids used to make your bed extra tight when you went to sleep, so that's where that comes from.|`|elECfJ52aa	it is part of an old saying meaning sleep well and I think it is sleep tite    ( even though spell checker says no )|`|0MunIx8raa	It is a very old phrase.  Some of the first beds actually had ropes to hold up the mattress instead of box springs.  So the phrase comes from keeping the ropes tightly tied and cinched up so your mattress wouldn't fall to the floor.|`|O57Ky6D0aa	sleep well|`|Yb72J5zDaa	so bed bugs dont get you|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	It seems that tight in this expression is the equivalent of the only surviving use of the adverb tightly meaning 'soundly, properly, well, effectively'. The full  Oxford English Dictionary labels the adverb 'now dialectal' and the adjective 'colloquial'. The phrase Good night, sleep tight is a conventional (rhyming) formula used when parting for the night or at bedtime.|`|2jxWrnUGaa	Keep warm, safe and don't let the bed bugs bite =P  idk haha!!  byess!|`|GkYR0uP1aa	keep your straight jacket on even at night
FgU7wYDSaa	OH YEAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!|`|7R7e6yX5aa	no, because their opinion does not matter and only you know if something is wrong with you|`|YW1DXceqaa	no, because why do i care about people opinions?|`|elECfJ52aa	I always say Whats your point?|`|NY2fpmvPaa	I'm really good at hiding when I'm upset/sad, so when there is something wrong with me, it must be bad if I'm letting it show. But I don't like people to be inconvenienced by me, so if they ask, it doesnt make me mad, it just makes me worried that I'm making them think about me.|`|EWIVAPx8aa	tell them they need to get their spine straightened|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	F*ck yeah.Everytime I don't talk for a while,everyone automatically thinks I'm brooding.It's like "What the hell,can't I just not say something for a while?Is it a crime?"Then I'll just snap at them,which is a huge mistake because then they'll think I'm being emo,even though I'm like the antithesis of emo.|`|hZ9omSataa	opinions are like aSsHoLeS every one has them and no one wants to see each others|`|BJkfY3g4aa	Gawd yes...If I wanted to tell him, I would just tell him..otherwise backthefuckoff me.|`|KXispLytaa	No, because I know there is something wrong with me. I don't like denying my disorder.|`|RvddYKqjaa	No, not at all. Most people are so into themselves it's very nice that they care about someone else. I consider it a blessing that people care enough to ask.   Lots of times people just snap, yes I'm fine. Often they aren't. If you ask you give them a chance to talk should they choose too, and remember one person doesn't know that another person might have asked you the same thing.|`|ZmGOL8kCaa	Yes! My dad always goes up to people (especially my brother), and it goes like this: "What's wrong?" "Nothing." "Tell me what's wrong." "I'm fine." "Would you tell if something was wrong?" "Sure."|`|2jxWrnUGaa	Yes!! Soooo much!! and then they say it again trying to be funny...  errr i wanna punch the person!! >:[  if i said it once or twice then i'm truely fine!    byeees!|`|H7ecdHDyaa	Exactly:)      I say "thank you" in reply and then walk away laughing as they get confused.     I don't let bad remarks get in my 'way'.|`|b6jt2eOtaa	yeahhh. and then you have to repeat "I'm FINE." like 100 times and then they say "okayyyy." all sarcastic and what not.|`|GkYR0uP1aa	What's wrong? Is everything ok?|`|JPDxyTT3aa	i wouldnt ask if you stopped crying uncontrollably like a girl.|`|y7ZAnmPUaa	whos doing the whole thumbs down thing today?    it is annoying, people can be so nosy.|`|zizfzrzKaa	Oh yeah, I hate that.  They ask you what's wrong and you say "nothing" and they keep insisting something is wrong when there's nothing wrong.  Eventually, something IS wrong - you're pissed they won't drop the subject.  And then when you admit you are now pissed, they kind of go, "I knew it."|`|fCHlfGKPaa	the problem i have is when they dont know jackshit about me|`|Dj3w4uCDaa	Nope, I just laugh.|`|UL3sHgqNaa	yea...it was like this one time someone told me to grow up.  I am already 6 feet tall.  Why would I need to grow more?|`|8sxD1qUBaa	Wrong like physically wrong or mentally? Hey i get told both...|`|WgomxNOOaa	OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I F******* hate when my bf says " are u ok" that makes me so mad, and i dont even answer that question, i just sat are you ok??? and he says yea why???  it like happens all the time, how do i prevent that crap from happening??????? help me.|`|1ZEcCmiXaa	yeppp  my mom thinks im "lost"

I'm 20 and I haven't needed my parent's in about 5 years. I haven't gotten financial support form them, my mom causes more emotional issues than they support. They're constantly fighting which drives me insane, my brother (still at home) is miserable. They never even call me or come visit me, unless I go to them. I'm even the one to start msn convos. I have to pay some of my mom's bills because she's too lazy to get a job but complains constantly.   However, i live with my best friend. We cook for eachother, we're always there for eachother, and if we don't know where the other person is at 3am we'll call and make sure the other is ok. My best friend even took off work to come to my surgery (wisdom teeth but was put out so needed someone there)... where my mom, unemployed, said she didn't have time to come.     Best friend over parent's no doubt. I hardly interact with my parents.|`|SiomJ10Saa	What's the question here?|`|Eiaz7z5vaa	depends for wat|`|rpSHQhtuaa	I prefer to tell stuffs to my best friends but I'll put my parents on top of my best friends any time =) they're not the coolest parents but I'm sure they'll be there for me when I need them..no matter how bad I've been.|`|8fyk1xJyaa	Parents...blood is thicker than water!

thcr8Y5vaa	J.K Rowling...|`|AkMZNRIzaa	neither . both are books for pre teenagers. By default I'd pick Meyer.|`|IIhiSprlaa	J.K. Rowling. At least she knows how to write a book. Stephanie Meyer is a terrible author.|`|UPdJF0tyaa	Stephenie Meyer...  i dont like either but i like Twilight better than HP|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	Both are good, but given my choice, I would read Harry Potter more. J.K Rowling totally changed the landscape of reading and though I love Twilight and The Host, they would not be here if it weren't for J.K and Harry Potter.|`|T9HOvdjtaa	I'd rather sleep with JK Rowling.|`|eXYY6qDtaa	J.K Rowling,  I dont like Twilight|`|Y0w2Pk5kaa	J.K Rowling, Twilight is not written well?????????|`|GpcbuAfmaa	There is no comparison...

Rowling. Her idea was original, and ALL genders and ages can enjoy it.    I've read Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series too. Her plot is very messy, and while the books can get any teenage girls' attention in a second, it doesn't do that with anyone else. Bella Swan is just plain. Her only flaw is her clumsiness, and that isn't even a flaw.    Plus, the characters from HP are just much more likable.|`|1l04qpOKaa	Stephanie Meyer

LOL (to high to even think, who will come to the station to get me...but then again maybe the effects would be gone before he got there?  So next thing i said is where i lived and they drove me home, "I said oh good my dad isnt home his car isnt here take me to the station."

Check this site for more details (and for download):   http://www.urusoft.net/products.php?lang...|`|iQAGeVjsaa	U go to Languages on the DVD Menu and click english subtitles|`|VvU76vJxaa	Hopefully you mean subtitles to a movie you are watching.  If so, usually after placing the movie in your player it will take you to the"menu" screen where you can press play or scene or extras (you get the idea), when it does select "language".  If you choose a language other than the one the movie was produced in, subtitles should appear.|`|wKHO6dEeaa	I thought you meant How do you place subtitles in a movie you are creating... if this is your question (which is why I starred it as interesting), please clarify, cuz I'd like to know as well.

1d56e30b9f829832cd1805523668073daa	Some viewers found it offensive. Here's a link to an Advertising Age story and comments about it: http://adage.com/bigtent/post?article_id...|`|kAp9hpMGaa	yeah i noticed it to, dont worry tho you will be seeing lots more verizon commercials now that they bought out alltel. my brother in law works at alltel and says that they will be merging commercials, i saw the first one the other day.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	I noticed that.  It's fairly common with commercials to show the longer version at first, then over time to cut lines of dialog to make it shorter and therefore less expensive.  Sometimes it makes the commercial less funny and entertaining, unfortunately!  Check out the commercials that will show during the Superbowl this coming Sunday - they're much longer than average and usually VERY funny!

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	The very thing that distinguishes major and minor scales and arpeggios is the difference in thirds; major scales have MAJOR thirds (eg A-C -E in A major) and minor scales have MINOR thirds (as in A-C-E). However, whether the minor scale is natural, harmonic or melodic does not affect the notes in the arpeggio. This is because the notes that vary in the different types of minor scales are the 6th and 7th notes of the scale rather than those within the arpeggio.    So, yes, major and minor aprpeggios are different but all minor scales share the same arpeggios (as long as you're sticking to tonic, third, dominant arpeggios, that is).|`|ZrpA7By4aa	an arpeggio is formed by playing the notes of a chord separately. a chord is formed with the first, third and fifth notes of the scale. So i presume that the arpeggios will be different for major scales, melodic minor scales and harmonic minor scales as the notes played are different.|`|CWejvYyuaa	No, where did you learn this? For A-major its the root position, then first inversion then second inversion, so A-C -E, then C -E-A, then E-A-C . In a-minor, it's A-C-E, then C-E-A, then E-A-C

Don't be dismayed if it doesn't say this, Mexican Fenders are merely assembled in Mexico, but the parts are all American...these are still fine quality instuments and a definite step up from the low end Squire's.         Of course, a Mexican Fender will not have the resale value or collectors quality of  "Made in U.S.A.."|`|vnPaVS1baa	If its mexican it will have a little sombrero painted on it somewhere, and if its from the US it will see its sister guitars and **** them.|`|pa4dVctPaa	I concur with Stan about the quality of the Mexican made instruments.  I have both a Mexican made Jazz bass and a Mexican made P-bass and both are great instruments.

TNtKPR3Oaa	His name is Allan (might be Allen) Sherman and he made a few albums that were parodies of the folk music craze of the late 60s.  Amongst his most well-known is "Hello Mudder, Hello Fadder" a song about going away to Camp Granada. Unfortunately, he died in the late 80s or early 90s, still a young man.  For more information, please use Yahoo search for him. I'm old enough to remember buying and listening to his music on vinyl- records.  I'm sure that you would enjoy his shtick.  BTW- I had 2 friends who eventually married, Harvey & Sheila. They loved their song.

All I know is there must be one hell of a jam session going on with Ronnie Van Zant, Allen Collins, Billy Powell, and the others with Duane Allman sitting in.|`|98XExOmqaa	i'd say that the deceased members would want them to continue and not let the music stop. as long as there is one surviving member then the legend of skynyrd should continue and when he dies it's up to the cover bands to keep it going.....by the way there is a cover band called Poison Whiskey that you would have to see to believe.|`|AA11352641	I think so, as long as there is a Van Zant singing. I saw them 2 years ago and I thought they were really good. They are a southern rock institution! I'd hate to see them to go on with like David Lee Roth as the front man and just turn into a joke for the sake of keeping it together. But a new keyboardist...I could live with that.|`|AA10958272	It's not about the band. It's about the brand.     Do you realize that the band "War" is still together with a clean slate of musicians, after 40 years? I know I'm into diff. areas of music here, but even the Beach Boys still play & attract large crowds.. with what? 1-2 original members?    You think, after 30 years of selling tickets, drawing crowds, earning & playing songs that are a sure thing (to make money)... and a proven track record of a stronger Southern Rock brand, than just about anyone else not name Allman.. that they'd let a little thing like another death slow them down? there was only 2 left, and now there's 1. If there was none, they'd still be heirs to the family business.|`|AA11605300	Even with all this unforseen tragedy, I think that Johnny should definitely kkep the name and things going.

GZC0vc5uaa	*SPOILERS* it was funny as hell for what it was, a spoof on films and those who take themselves too seriously. it easy to see who they are ripping robert downey jr is obviously channeling russel crowe, jack black is doing a combo of eddie murphy and andy dick and stiller is doin every action hero from the late 80's on up. the fake previews in the beginning were great and i will never hear ludacris or flo-rida the same after tom cruise.|`|gU4zcPAaaa	IT WAS HILARIOUS.  but at the same time, i was watching it with my grandfather so..  yeah you can figure that one out.|`|cDpu1Dxyaa	I loved it.

iQAGeVjsaa	Audition is about this guy who is lonely so instead of being normal and going to a bar to find a girls, he holds this fake audition for a fake movie. The girl he like and picks to date, seems like a really sweet girl, but she is not. I am not going to give anything away. But keep in mind the whole movie is a build up to the last 30 mins so your gonna be watching it thinking this is not scary and then the movie makes a total 180 and its freaky as hell. The guy who directed Hostel is terrified of this movie This movie is not as bloody as Hostel but its freaky so freaky that i cant watch that movie without someone, its, just oh god its soo freaky.     Hostel is about these 3 or 4 i cant remember guys who go to Europe. All they really want to do is have alot of sex, so this girl that one of them has sex with tells them about this Hostel that has a lot of hot chicks. The go think they are going to get laid but instead it turns out the Hostel is a place where these overly wealthy men order young men and women to kill and torture. Its bloody and over the top. The director of Audition actually appears in Hostel if you watch it, he is the Japanese rich guy who doesnt speak english too well.     Hope this helps|`|gwI5SQ6Iaa	audition is about this middle aged man with a teenaged son who lost his wife a few years before. he's grown lonely. his friend suggests he hold fake auditions to find a woman. the one he likes in the application and meets in the audition turns out to be a psycho and tortures him.    hostel is about these 2 friends who go backpacking through europe and there's a lot of sex lol. they go to this place on of the skanky girls takes them to. the place is like an abandoned factory and they are tortured by rich men who want to kill someone.     hope this helps you ;]|`|p0vC7UO4aa	I've heard of Audition from Bravos 100 scariest movies. It made 11 out of 100. Heres the plot off of google..    Seven years after the death of his wife, company executive Aoyama is invited to sit in on auditions for an actress. Leafing through the resums in advance, his eye is caught by Yamazaki Asami, a striking young woman with ballet training. On the day of the audition, she's the last person they see. Aoyama is hooked. He notes her number from her file, calls her and takes her to dinner. He hesitates to call again, worried that he'll seem too eager. When he does, Asami knowingly lets the phone ring for some time before answering. She's alone in her darkened room - alone, that is, apart from the writhing victim she has tied up in a sack on the floor...|`|g6SffJHtaa	Hostel: Dudes go to red light districts.

I know that you got a lot of responses to this question,  but this is the answer that you need to listen to.  Trust me!  24 is awesome!  It has everything that you could ever want in a TV show.  Drama, action, romance, suspense & really good plot lines.  But I will warn you, it's addictive.  They just began the seventh season a few weeks ago,  but you could probably find the first 6 seasons at Block Buster.  I don't know if you know anything about it, but it's all in real time.  Each season is one day. Each episode is one hour.  There are 24 episodes in a season.  It's basically about fighting terrorism & about a really awesome  main character named Jack Bauer.  It's not the kind of show whrere you can just start watching   at any point & still know what's going on.  You have to start from the beginning, or at least the beginging  of a season.  It comes on monday nights on fox.  CHOOSE 24!  I've seen a lot of TV shows, & it really is the best.  Hope I could help.|`|ciQjwtTcaa	Watch LOST  its in its 5th season but their all out on DVD and its AMAZING!!! and its still getting me!!|`|5Pgs61ePaa	Charmed    Alias|`|fQghpx3Zaa	Comedy:  Seinfeld  Whose Line is it Anyway?

Vsw6pXTSaa	She is just beautiful and what I've noticed is when someone is beautiful people tend to give them more credit than they deserve. Do you hear the garbage on the radio nowadays?  The worse the song the hotter the artist.   My friend was blasting some song on youtube (the kind of song that makes you wish you were deaf)  So I go to turn the volume down and there singing was the most beautiful woman ever...Suddenly the song wasn't that bad, but i still turned the volume down =)|`|bda293c7e62b91bcb5c4eed0f3cd5839aa	I only know who she is from Quantom of Solace, and to be honest I was quite glad when her character got killed off. I'm glad she didn't have a bigger role. She is supposed to be an up & coming superstar in the world of acting, but it really doesn't take much to become a 'star' in the UK. Maybe if she does something a little less bimbo-esque, I'll reconsider my very average, 'who's she?'  opinion of her.|`|XuDqmgGTaa	I've never even heard of her.
Klw3Ke3Haa	Your question is too vague. What shows are they from, there are a lot of characters named Tamaki or Lavi.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Both from different anime genres. Therefore, my answer: both    You can't compare shounen and shoujo anime and manga together. Its way too debative and problematic. It'll be a neverending argument of which one is better since there's an equal amount of fans for both genres.|`|Qqyf8IM1aa	uhm... from what animes are those characters from? if its Tamaki from Ouran Koukou Host Club then..

That said, I like GH more for the challenging side and song creator but RB2's instruments are better made and everything non-songwise is better..|`|jXHTeMjZaa	Yes, very much so.

And you think she's appreciate it or me? NO.  She would always take the biggest slice for herself and with no consideration if it had been 13hours since you had last eaten.

iIoRVlx0aa	Michael Buble is the best!  I guarantee you'll love him.  He's modern, but sings the best jazz/standards from the past.  - "Everything"  -"Quando, Quando, Quando" with Nelly Fertado  -"Sway"  -"Fever"    Ella Fitzgerald, the legend herself.  She's great!  -Cheek to Cheek ft. Louis Armstrong  -Lady is a Tramp ft. Frank Sinatra   -Youll have to Swing it.  -Mack the Knife    Diana Krall, modern pianist and singer  -Peel me a Grape  -Fly me to the Moon  -Just the Way you Are    Eva Cassidy  -Blue Skies  -At Last    Madeleine Peyroux, modern French jazz artist(kinda reminds me of Billie Holiday)  -Dont Cry Baby  -Dance Me To the End of Love    Renee Olstead, young singer/actress.  I love her voice!  -Sunday kind of love  -What a Difference a Day Makes  -Sentimental Journey    Nat King Cole, a classic! (No ipod should go without Nat King Cole!)  -Unforgettable  -Smile  -Sweet Lorraine  -Autumn Leaves  -Almost Like Being in Love  -L-O-V-E  -I Wish you Love|`|jcL7gDMKaa	dixieland jazz is easily my favourite! There are loads of dixieland bands out there. just do a search for dixieland music online or on imesh if u have it.  Also Cab Calloway, Chick Webb, Marilyn Monroe, Chet Baker, Acker Bilk are also amazing jazz artists.    Oopsie! must have been a typing error! And Marilyn Monroe was actually a singer as well as an actress! I have a couple of her songs, thankyou very much! xxx|`|angW1Lkfaa	I like Chuck Mangione  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ_8dESzB...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zq3qq-4Z...

Hope, if your lookin for some real jazz music then there are tons of artists that are amazing. John Coltrane and miles davis are jazz legends and then richie cole, paul desmond, luis armstrong, benny golson, michael brecker, art blakey, ben webster, charlie parker, the jazz messengers, herbie hancock, and the brubeck quartet are also great.  Good luck finding something you like... hope this helped

"Captain John Hart, note the sarcasm."  "Hey I worked my way up the ranks!"  "I'll bet the ranks were very grateful." - Captains Jack and John    4) "Of course, bananas are far more interesting." - Ianto Jones    5) "That's a poodle."  "That's beautiful." - Gwen Cooper and Captain John    6) "There you go! I can taste it! Oestrogen. Definitely oestrogen. Take the pill, flush it away, it enters the water cycle. Feminizes the fish. Goes all the way up into the sky then falls all the way back down onto me. Contraceptives in the rain. Love this planet. Still, at least I won't get pregnant. Never doing that again." - Captain Jack    7) "Period military is not the dress code of a straight man." - Owen Harper    8) "Just what I need, a rodent watching me while I work. I think I'll call it Owen." - Toshiko Sato    9) "Skinny guy in tight jeans runs into water? I was taking pictures!" - Captain Jack    10) "As a matter of fact I was wondering if you could do us a favour."  "What, the humble police helping the mighty Torchwood? Why don't you help yourselves like you normally do?"  "Because we can't."  "Why's that?"  "We're sort of busy."  "Well I'm busy too, try someone else."  "No no no no no. It's, it's, it's just because we, we can't at the moment because we're sort of... stuck."  "In what way?"  "....We're locked in."  "You're locked in?"  "Just a little bit."  "Locked in where?"

9KWVgb9naa	have you considered wrestling or bodybuilding ?|`|jz9CnL2Eaa	It seems like most of the time that MADE focuses on something TOTALLY different from what you already are - to really take you out of your box and completely give you a different perspective on things.  So if you are a team athlete, and it sounds like you are, think of things totally different and separate from team athletics.  Or something totally different and separate from where you live.  If you live in a warm climate by the beach, maybe you'd want to be made into a competitive snowboarder.  Or if you  live in a snowy area, maybe you'd want to be made into a surfer or a a kite boarder.  So, I think the more focus you can put on being made into something that would otherwise be exceptionally unlikely, given who you are and where you live, the better chance you have of being chosen (then someone who just wants to be made into something cool that's already been done).  Sounds like a lot of fun.  Good luck!

eFowEpbLaa	Obtaining a Copyright    Obtaining a copyright is a thorny legal matter, and the process may differ depending on where you do business. Copyright protection laws and what is needed for copyright registration may also vary from place to place. There are certain standards that a work must meet in order to qualify for copyright protection, and the whole process will take some time. It is also worth noting that, while there are internationally recognized copyright agreements, there are still major differences in international copyright law.    Consulting an Attorney    When looking to obtain a copyright, it is definitely worthwhile to consul a copyright attorney and review all of the required copyright forms. While it may seem like a lengthy process, there are many benefits to securing the legal rights to your intellectual work.     Trademarks and Patents    Trademarks and patents differ from copyrights, though they all deal with the legal concept of intellectual property. Just like copyright, its important for a small business owner to understand the basics of laws surrounding both trademarks and patent, both for the sake of protecting intellectual property and preventing lawsuits.    A trademark is something that has been legally registered to represent a company. And it can be anything from a slogan to a distinct graphic (like your logo). Establishing trademarks is important to defend your business identity.     A patent is the legal protection of a certain invention (whether that invention is a tangible object or a process, etc.). It defends the patent-holders rights to make or sell a patented item or method. Patenting is especially important to business owners who want to maintain sole rights to a specific type of product - if youre looking to market that great invention, make sure its patented first!|`|vOOf7xdEaa	Call a lawyer or talk to somone already in the buisness.

He was outside the bar, checking his messages on the voicemail, saw there was one from Neela. He was so wasted he thought he was still on the sidewalk, but was actually in the middle of the street and a huge truck hit him.|`|0MunIx8raa	If I remember right, I think he was drunk and was trying to find the girl, uhm, the indian girl?

DAHBUvtLaa	Well first you would need a bass, a baritone, and tenor.   You could also have another baritone, so one baritone  would probably be a higher baritone and one would be   a lower baritone. You don't need a piano, that's why it's  A Capella. It's all vocal with no instrumental. You should   probably get some vocal lessons as well if you have no   experience. make sure everyone else in your a capella   group has had vocal lessons or taken chorus. also check  out wiki pedia to read more about it. here's the link. =]|`|vwm0lPcWaa	Commonly you would need at least a bass, a tenor, and 2 middle voice or baritone.But a capella different with other goup vocals. Because of no music accompaniment, they should:  1. Every personnel have unique timbral and strict to vocal range  2. Every personal have same vocal power.  Todays trend an acapella group usually fill the song with vocals all the time. That's why 1 or 2 more vocals for fill the song with constant beat or hum. You can learn by watching Neri Per Caso or other acapella group.  The basic technics for this group is harmony and dynamics. With regular practice on harmony and dynamics you will develop rapidly.

WpqwaqcQaa	they both used technology not seen in other films.    The Citizen Kane showcased a technique called "universal focus." To get the image of Kane and the poster picture during the speech sequence, short lenses were used. At the same time, the key light (the main lights) were gradually increased to get both images sharp and clear.    The Slumdog used a prototype Digital Cinema Camera from Silicon Imaging. When used in Mumbai, there were SI technicians on set constantly to deal with any problems the prototype had, of which there were many.

He played as a defender, most notably, for Sheffield Wednesday, Hull City and Manchester United. As an international he captained Ireland and was a member of the team that won the 1914 British Home Championship. However O'Connell is probably best remembered for managing several clubs in La Liga. In 1935 he led Real Betis to their one and only La Liga title and during the Spanish Civil War he took FC Barcelona on a tour of North America. Despite these successes, he died destitute in London in 1959.    Patrick O'Connell (born, January 29, 1934 in Dublin) is a retired Irish actor known for numerous performances on UK television and in films.    He was brought up in Birmingham, England and after working in the office of a department store he trained as an actor at RADA. He then appeared in repertory theatre, at the Royal Court Theatre and with the Royal Shakespeare Company.    His television appearances include Fraud Squad as (Detective Inspector Gamble), Dixon of Dock Green, The Brothers (as Edward Hammond), Yes Minister, The Professionals, We'll Meet Again, The Bill, Inspector Morse, Peak Practice, Dangerfield and As Time Goes By.    His film roles include The Shooting Party, The Human Factor, The McKenzie Break (as Sergeant Major Cox) and Cromwell.    He is also an artist known for his paintings and drawings.

ajlBdO5Raa	There really isn't a clear-cut answer to this question.  You'll really want to choose the bass based on what suits your preferred style.  Because of the shape and configuration of different basses, you're going to find it easier to play one style over another on any given instrument.    Your best bet, in my opinion, is to go to your local music store and ask them to let you try out a few different instruments.  They'll usually gladly give you a patch cord and set you up on a practice amp.  Try them out.  Find which one has the best weight for you, the best feel for you, the best body shape for you, and the best pickup configuration for you.    Personally, I have three basses, and each is radically different from the other.  The accoustic is hard to play standing up, but it's got that really rich sound to it.  Can't really slap or pop with it, though.  The short-scale Epiphone lets me really go nuts, because my hands aren't all that large and I can reach the frets easily, but the tone is insanely dependent on exact finger positiong.  This one is great to use with a pick, because of the fact that my thumb can't really hook well anywhere.  The Fender is much better if I want to use my fingers, because of the body shape and the location of the pickups.  I can anchor my thumb in a few spots, and on top of that the action of slapping is nice on that instrument.    Your best bet: get yourself out to a store with a wide selection and just try a bunch of them out.  Most music stores will gladly let you play around with the instruments for a bit!    Good luck!|`|TTaLB4kdaa	Where are you planning on buying it form? Usually if it's a good trusted music store they'll deffinetly help you and won't rip you off. Truthfully i'd start out with a cheap one just incase you decide you lose interest or something like that. If you get better and enjoy it get a nicer one.

Angie look super hot & Common as he always does.|`|jfEOIeSIaa	DEATH RACE...hands down. amazing movie. Favorite jason statham movie. I LOVED IT.|`|GAqCA8RJaa	It depends on what you are looking for...Wanted was more shoot-em-up graphic and Death Race had a little less complex story.  Wanted was more intense and kept you hanging on to find out what happened and had an unexpected ending.  Death Race was pretty much "what you see is what you get".    Hope that helps!!    P.S.  I liked Death Race more, but my husband liked Wanted more!!

dYyiG90caa	Well, maybe on this Site & Section --    But, out in the REAL World -- Most People don't even Know that Gabriel was ever with Genesis.    To ANSWER --     I think it simply comes down to -- That the Gabriel-Era had a LOT MORE True Prog --    I don't think it's a Personal Attack on Collins -- Because All of the Remaining Musicians -- Started Writing "separately" and thus the Albums that Followed ( though I think "A Trick of The Tail" is BETTER than a lot of the Early Albums )    So - Again -- I think it's the Stubbornness of Proggers who "stick-by" the Gabriel-Era -- Because in Fact -- It IS more Progressive, Overall than the Collins-Era.    NOW -- Ask me which ERA made Money ?? LOL :))    In 1975, when Gabriel Left the Band -- They were 2 Million Dollars in-Debt.    In 1976 -- "A Trick of the Tail" with Collins Up-Front, became the First Genesis "Gold Album"    I LIKE Both Periods for Different Reasons.    IF YOU Listen to the Gabriel SOLO Albums -- the 3rd & 4th are Masterpieces --    HOWEVER -- They do NOT sound like Gabriel-Era Genesis --    So, obviously -- Even Peter Gabriel wanted a "Change" from the Early-Era, himself !!    HERE IS a Comparative Story about "Stubbornness" --    I've many People who grew-up in the 60's and MOST of THEM have told me that They --    LOVED the 1st 2 Led Zeppelin Albums.    But, starting with LZ III -- They knew "the magic" was Over !!    Can you believe that.    LZ III is a GREAT Album -- but some Old-Timers -- just did not see it that way.    It's all a matter of Perspective & Preference, I guess ??    EDIT --    I agree with "Don S" about Steve Hackett.    The Best Genesis Line-up IMO -- Was --    from the 3rd thru 8th Albums --    "Nursery Cryme" thru "Wind & Wuthering"    Peter Gabrial - Vocals  Steve Hackett - Guitars, Treatments, & Explorations.  Phil Collins - Drums and Backing Vocals (solo on 2 songs)  Tony Banks - Keyboards, 12-string Guitar, Backing Vocals  Mike Rutherford - Bass, 12-string Guitar, Backing Vocals    BUT - As I said earlier -- I LOVE ALL their Stuff, except "Calling All Stations."    NOTE -- Their BEST 12-String Guitarist was --    Anthony Phillips from their 1st & 2nd Albums ( Collins & Hackett had not joined, yet )    The 2nd Album "TRESPASS" --    -- with Phillips on Guitars & John Mayhew on Drums --  is a BEAUTIFULLY-CRAFTED Album !!    ( I am sure that "Fonzie T" will agree with me on this one !! :)    Their First Album has Grown on me A lot --     It's their Least Known Album -- But has been Remastered with TONS of Cool Extras !!    It is NOT Symphonic Prog -- But is kind of a Cross between the Moody Blues and early-Bee Gees.    Seriously -- It's a Good Album !! :)  .|`|MwSaCettaa	I AGREE    PHIL ERA WAS AMAZING!!!

I'll never forget the hatred for the "Invisible Touch" album.|`|vcx06TdQaa	I quite like "Invisible Touch" and "I Can't Dance". Both of which, as you know, are from the Phil Collins era|`|76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	It's the same people who judge Fleetwood Mac (Tell Me Lies) by their mid-80s pop and not their whole body of work.

Phil rocks!|`|1ViGcF3xaa	Because none of the songs from their post-Gabriel albums compare to their great earlier songs like: The Knife, The Musical Box, Watcher of the Skies, Get Em' Out By Friday, The Return of the Giant Hogweed, Supper's Ready, Firth of Fifth, etc.  Not only that but watching them in concert was great with Peter Gabriel donning all the different costumes and his stage presence.  There was also a huge void left without the Gabriel and Collins harmonies.  I'll have to admit liking a few Collins era songs like Squonk, Abacab, and a couple of others but to me they were nowhere near as good as when Gabriel fronted the band.|`|yS61H04haa	For me, it is a matter of personal taste. I respect them, sure. I rescept Phil Collins. I just can not, will not listen to Genesis ( Phil collins era or not ).|`|2FA9qNHzaa	It's just that Peter Gabriel was sooooo much better.  The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.   Yep.|`|cbZdeOSPaa	PJ. beat me to it, he gave my answer :(|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	I find "Duke (1980)" to be a great album.  Phil Collins really comes into his own on Duke.  It is one of my favorite albums.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Philesis got way too little respect.  Of course people were mad at them for breaking up the original lineup.  But albums like Trick of the Tail and Abacab were really excellent albums, well played, written and produced.  I have a friend who's a hardcore Genesis fan and he plays drums in a great tribute band:  www.gabbleratchet.com - check them out there are several great recordings.

No matter what clothe laying l wear. What l find that keeps me warm firstly, is sitting by the Radiator. Gaah, that's heaven :) I wear chunky scarves, and a buff coat, not too buff, but a little buff, not them coats that are slim and only for fashion in summers. Woolly mittens, and a nice cup of hot cocoa, um, a bath with lavender seems to warm me up to. Moving about alot to get blood pumping also helps.. Anyway, I'll stop the rant =D

uD1S5dYtaa	Yes they are the same.  You know, of course, that the north node describes the lessons you chose to learn in this lifetime.  With a Pisces node the lesson is selflessness.  You must learn to put the welfare of others before your own.  And with  a 11th house placement the arena is in the public eye, dealing with organizations and groups.  You could be a community organizer!|`|Lk4aCBACaa	Yes they are the same. :)    The difference is whether it's a true node or a mean node, and all that differs there is how it's calculated. The difference between them is usually very slight.    In general, a North Node in Pisces in the 11th suggests giving back to your local community by developing your creative and/or psychic talents, imagination, compassion, etc.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Yes, they are.
dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Having a Taurus ascendant means that your personality is steady, strong, grounded, quiet.  Scorpio descendant indicates the dominant characteristics of your partner.  It also means in what type of situations you will meet people - usually intense.|`|ggxgDG3Haa	I have that also, look at astro.com, it explains it all.|`|uD1S5dYtaa	You have Taurus rising.  That means you approach new things and situations as a Taurus would, with caution, very carefully.  People see you initially as that way too.  You seem to be quiet, thoughtful and careful when meeting new people or trying new things.  Scorpio is just the opposite sign on the opposite side of the chart.  It shows the kind of partner you are looking for.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	People see you as a Taurus or have some Taurus personality traits. You're attracted to a Scorpio personality.

You aren't really looking up!  lol.|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	em...."pretty much"! ops! i used it again! hahahaha    i think "pretty much" is like "almost much".    they used "pretty" instead of other words cause it is nicer! and i like it too!
f40KxtwXaa	Episode 106 maybe? when sailor uranus comes in.    Then Minako says, "That girl..." Everyone looks to see a dark skinned, red haired girl. Makoto says it's Elza Gray. [Note: Elza Gray is not Japanese, so her family name is Gray, her given name is Elza.] The others don't know who she is, but Makoto explains Elza Gray is one of the top runners in Japan for obstacles and hurdles. Usagi's impressed. Elza stops by a water fountain and wipes her face. When she looks up, she sees the other girls. They bow.     At the circuit, Haruka walks by a half-open garage. She hears moaning from inside and enters. There is a boy in a Mugen Gakuen uniform on the ground; he tells her to help him, then something comes out of him and transforms him into a huge, red monster with big fangs. (It looks like the daimon from the manga.) Haruka picks up a pipe and is about to hit the monster, but she remembers the boy pleading for her to help him. She pauses, and the monster lunges at her. She blocks it with the pipe, but it's knocked out of her hands. The daimon lunges towards her again, but this time a bright light appears between them. The daimon pulls back. Haruka watches in amazement as her transformation stick appears before her. She reaches for it, but a voice tells her, "Don't!"       XD
mLdlFhyqaa	I think like at sports events, when you are in the crowd, and your team has just won the last game of the season...  like, for the NHL, you win the Stanley Cup...

That was one of my favorite albums this year. It had some amazing tracks. But I think were still probably 3 tracks that I regularly find myself skipping. At most a classic should have 2 and that is only if it is a longer album and the rest is near flawless.<br>  <br>  I think the album starts off great, then kind of fades for a few tracks and then finishes strong. Plus it is still to early to know what kind of replay value it will have.|`|9vYXBqetaa	not classic<br>  you did miss a worthwhile listen though<br>  maybe a new headpiece that toad kinda old.

Qzn1cungaa	it comes out novemer 21st or 23rd its the same date that twilight was released on but of this year
kbFty6eVaa	I heartily agree with you. I would jsut make a slight alteration     1 Hilary Hahn, the others, in no order    Gil Shaham, Schlomo Mintz, Julia Fischer, Rachel Barton Pine      These I feel are the best interpreters of music, not to mention complete mastery of technique and sound|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Maxim Vengerov is a huge omission on your list. He has had some injuries recently and has been getting into conducting, but he is perhaps the best around.  you also missed Itzhak Perlman who still gets around.  I saw Gil Shaham perform the Beethoven a while back - he was phenomenal.|`|833a435e36344342d10e69454b7e6731aa	Hilary hahn played the Bach Chaconne as an encore here!  I don't know if I really like her, but yes I agree with some that she has amazing technique and sound.... I don't know about her musicality though. It seems a little dry.  I would have to say my top 5 in no order would be Vengerov, Perlman, Christian Tetzlaff, Nikolaj Znaider, Midori  those were the first 5 I liked that popped into my head. I still haven't been able to see a concert for Vengerov or Perlman though :(|`|ThKkn5fKaa	I saw Shaham do both the Tchaikovsky and Barber Concertos a few years back. I had to find my socks once the Tchaikovsky concert was over because he knocked them off.  Bell did the Tchaikovsky with the PSO to start this season and I just wasn't anywhere nearly as impressed.  Maybe it's because I was more familiar with the concerto by then, or maybe it's because I was more interested in seeing Honeck conduct Mahler 1, but Bell just didn't seem to have that wow factor that Shaham did.  I was impressed, but I couldn't compare it to Shaham's performance.  Anne-Sophie Mutter would definitely be at the top of my list though.  Everything I've heard her do has just wowed me.  I've never heard Pine live.  I don't know if she just hasn't been to Pittsburgh recently or if I've simply missed the concert.  And I missed Chang when she was here recently.  I wish I had more symphony spending money....|`|VWodBSyoaa	My favorites by far... (in no particular order)    Hilary Hahn  Anne-Sophie Mutter  Sarah Chang  Joshua Bell  Maxim Vengerov (Doesn't seem to be as well-known as the others, but is a PHENOMENAL violinist)|`|n99NOgHJaa	I can only think of one name at the present. But I really like James Ehnes !!!|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	Gosh, you will get all sorts of opinions on this (which is probably what you want). I would have to leave-out two on your list for strong personally-held reasons. Hilary Hahn is technically brilliant (and not unattractive!) but I find her musically sterile - not an ounce of soul for my ears. I would also have to leave out Josh Bell because he's a charlatan.    My five (in no particular order except alphabetical) would have to be:    Sarah Chang  Anne-Sophie Mutter  Gil Shaham  Maxim Vengerov  Thomas Zehetmair    I bet you get LOADS of Itzhak Perlman entries! He'd probably be in my top 10-ish.
5c6b99285c6b8893ed729455cb249619aa	Thanks for including my suggestion with your Shows of the Week. It was a pleasant surprise to see postings of people liking a band they would not have heard of otherwise. Thanks again.    To be honest, The Breakfast wasn't my first choice. I originally wanted to send you (Wire and String) a concert by From Good Homes. The FGH show does not have a streaming option, only download. I went with the Breakfast show because it was more convenient for you. If you are willing to take some time, I can almost promise you that you will like the FGH show that I am including the link to.    A little bit about FGH.  They were a local band from Sparta, NJ. They got their name because they had left their equipment at a bar they had played the night before and they needed it for a gig the next day. The bar was closed, so they broke in just to get their stuff. Eventually, they ended up in court for breaking in. The judge let them off because he said they were "from good homes". The band went with it.  They were opening up for Bob Weir's band on some local shows, just before they broke up.  If the singer sounds familiar, its because he went on to sing for Railroad Earth. Enough gab from me.    If you want to sample one song from the show try any of these...    Cool Me Down  Way Down Inside  I Am a Mess  OR, my personal favorite of the concert- I Only Want.    http://www.archive.org/details/fgh1994-0...|`|fcf94fd558c72875735d4fe3f1389736aa	MA:    http://www.archive.org/details/eits2008-...         http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-07-   11.aud.cotsman.9379.sbefail.shnf    MA2: I really enjoyed this one yet again.

i8vpe2g7aa	I suppose some people think Twilight is better because it's easier to read. It doesn't require thinking at all. I can't think of any other reason. I've seen some Twilight fans say it's because Harry Potter's boring (which is funny especially considering how little happens in Twilight), the characters are more realistic / believable (also funny, Meyer admitted that she didn't develop her characters so that readers could project themselves onto them. They're just a bunch of Mary-Sues, and who the hell experiences true love in like 3 weeks?) and that it's more mature (because two teenagers obsessing over each other when they hardly know one another because they smell nice / look pretty is certainly very mature). They make up a whole bunch of reasons like that that aren't even true.    I just don't understand it at all. There isn't a real reason. Even people who hate both series know that Harry Potter is better. There is much more realistic love in Harry Potter than in Twilight. In Twilight they don't even have reasons for loving each other, they just do. Ron and Hermione's relationship was love but with Edward and Bella it just seems like lust. Twilight was also very superficial. Harry Potter does have great morals. In Twilight Bella believes herself to be better than everyone else and leaves all of her family and friends behind so that she could go and live with the pretty people and be immortal because the thought of aging is so disgusting to her.    I just assume that people who like Twilight more don't like real books because they're too complicated for them or have not experienced love before and believe that the 'romance' in Twilight is desirable. They also keep saying that Edward is really sexy / hott (yes, with two t's) so they must like its superficiality.    Also, Edward Cullen is not even romantic. He is an emotionally abusive stalker. He breaks into her room and watches her while she sleeps and stops her from going to see friends by taking a part out of her truck. But Bella and the fangirls don't care because he is apparently really pretty.|`|NY2fpmvPaa	I really liked the Twilight books. They were really good. But, Harry Potter I think is still better. Well, different stories, but the whole world of Harry Potter was well thought out and just an amazing story. Twilight...there's nothing really original about the story itself. Stephanie Meyer is just a very good writer, and the story is just really well-written and so easy to read. Not that it's not a good story, but Harry Potter was better!    The movies....Twilight was such a bad movie. I was so disappointed!  After the Harry Potter movies got a new director for the 4th movie....they started getting really good. I can't say much for the first 3 movies, but the ones after that have been awesome.    I think the ONLY reason they are comparing the two with one another is that they both have been VERY popular. So, there was Harry Potter, and then we had nothing really as far as literature went that caused a huge craze. Then, there was Twilight. It's just their popularity that they have in common, not the stories themselves.|`|nHhQ952Kaa	I have no idea really I don't Harry Potter kills Twilight anytime, I like both before they were popular, but by only two months each. but still there is nothing good to Twilight, I don't claim my sister anymore because she loves Twilight|`|NPbSdQ1Paa	Harry Potter rock Twilight sucks|`|VsamHLPOaa	HP will always be the best.

Harry Potter has some romance, but in very small quantities. People are addicted to the stronger passion in Twilight. Something that Harry Potter lacks, despite being a great series.|`|LB56uuPoaa	Twilight is the best! All those people who like harry potter better are just jealous of Edward because he's so HOT! My favorite character is Alice. She's AWSOME!!!!|`|RaWpWuagaa	On the surface, Harry Potter and Twilight seem similar because of the supernatural blah blah blah.    But really, they are so different.    Twilight is a ROMANCE series... which ultimately draws a bit of a different crowd.    Harry Potter is MYSTERY and ADVENTURE.  So it's only natural that he romantics prefer Twilight, because the entire series is about the pursuit thereof.    Let's be honest.  JKR does did not write a lot of romance into the HP books.      But that's about the only thing, in my opinion, that Stephenie Meyer did better.   The Harry Potter world is just so much more involved, elaborate and detailed than any other book within this genre.  And of course there is the almost innumerable amount of subplots that give the characters depth and personality.  Plus all the hidden references to people and places make it so much more fun to re-read the books,  There really is something new every time.  You just have to read it right.|`|U1JhYzRkaa	I don't know.. Harry Potter is better than Twilight! Twilight is just about love and crap while harry potter has more detail and events.

While we were having out (innocent) fun, along the side on the cement was forming a nice thick patch of ice.  This patch of ice right below where my hopping took place.

Thus your own birth would not have been prevented as you have already been born but in the new alternate reality you would not exist. <br>  <br>  The thought that every possibility has and is happening in alternate realities comes in to effect. In one reality you where born and lived. In the alternate reality you didn't. Time travel is thought to be a jump from one reality to the next so disruption to the space/time continuuum is impossible. <br>  You couldn't go back in time and kill Hitler as a child because it's already happened. If you did go back and kill him then another reality would exist with these circumstances.|`|f7b5389cba81b527f8c3257b955d4fa9aa	This is a classic time travel paradox, its impossible because if say at the age of 20 in 2008 you travelled back to 1998 and prevented your own conception, you could not exist in 2008 and so could never have travelled back in time to prevent your own birth in the first place. In an occurence such as this you get the Donnie Darko effect, the opening of a tangent universe in which "you" were never born, but your 20 year old self would exist within this tangent 1998 as your physical self travelled back in time, but none of your friends and family would know who you were because "you" wouldn't exist for them, after 20 years in this tangent universe, you would still exist in 2008 but you would be 40 not 20. <br>  <br>  I hope this makes sense.|`|HEiK9ifDaa	no. because in the present you have already gone back in time. what with time being linier. if you could and had then you woulgn't exist now so you wouldn't be able to go back anyway. see, confusing.|`|96ULApwcaa	Can you change the future if it has already happened |`|viclm5eRaa	Give it a try.<br>  <br>  Fingers crossed.|`|EK9q6e96aa	i don't think so.... i was "planned" :P|`|Kno1eWE1aa	I suppose so, Why would you want to?|`|XMJf450Paa	Yes, I could shoot my uncle|`|xdF08Uqfaa	Marry your mother.|`|ll3MzvXqaa	i would think so i would like to have been born in 1984 and 1985

Lots of nasty narrow-minded Libs on the boards tonight.  I think she has a tough job trying to get a word in edgewise around all these other idiots (other than Whoopi - she can at least have a conversation without being nasty and making faces).  I would like to see any of these responders above me sit at a table with a bunch of Conservatives and talk about why what you think is right... you would get so frustrated and give up.  I'm surprised she's lasted as long as she has because I would have gone crazy listening to Behar for so long, and I hope she has a wonderful pregnancy.  The rest of you need to grow up...|`|coj54cacaa	Why hasn't she been fired yet?|`|GT6396BDaa	It will be good to have a break from her.

Whoppie is just a has been riding the coat tails of previous success.

It should be about your thoughts & opinions on things. Not "well...I had breakfast today, went to school, and stared at the wall."     WHO CARES?! I mean really. Write about something people WANT TO READ!!    I love it when people write about something that is thought-provoking & so true about a subject. I love how it is so freeing to write about anything & people can find comfort that they are not alone in their transgressions & hardships.

In the school I went to for Jr. High the Staff at the school(teachers, principal,etc.) ENCOURAGED bullying(they let people bully and get away with doing things like shoving people down the stairs. This happened to me, and I was shoved hard by a bully who said something pretty nasty when I was shoved, and I broke my foot. When I reported it to the staff at the school, nothing was done even though my foot was in a cast.) and would not do anything about what the people who bullied did even if they did it right in front of a staff member at the school! I moved to a different area when I finished Jr. High because of this, and High School still had bullies, but it was not as bad(It was still pretty bad, but it was not EXTREMELY bad like in Jr. High since I was in a different school with different people.). The staff at the High School I went to also did not seem to do much on bullying incidents until we got a new principal in my final year of high school. The person that was the principal until my final year was just as bad as the staff members at my Jr.High school, he seemed to support and encourage bullying by his lack of actions in bullying incidents. But when we got a new principal, things got a bit better since she at least seemed to deal with bullying issues.|`|UhHrVXQGaa	Its Ok but I hate getting up at 5:00 in the morning and waiting in the cold for the frickn' late bus to come!

64b30529e90c450c141510da1e5d7f1caa	1. I think he felt a certain way about her part in killing of 300 people. It could also mean that it hurt him too much to see her that way...    2.He probably was still hurt about the way she left him. and still felt some kind of way of her part of the killings. I.E in the visit he asked her what she learned or what she thought about the past.    3.She probably had nothing to live for...she may have had high hopes before his visit...    4. He did not want her to have any ideas...probably still mad at her for breaking his heart....i think that her breaking his heart that way had him to not trust people...and disconnected with people (not visiting his father's funeral...)I also believe that he still feels guilty for not speaking up bout her secret....if he said something she probably would of gotten 4 years. He probably was more so vindictive by keeping the secret and therefore feel guilty about it for many years after that.    5. Kate was excellent...I have a hard time understanding why she was nominated for best supporting when clearly she is the star of the movie.|`|eoqTXCGxaa	He was heart-broken.     Hannah killed herself, I thought, because she had no one to be with, or to stay with, and she will always be known as the "Nazi". Also the fact that Michael pretty much told her that there's no chance for him and her.    I dunno, that's what I thought.
8PMIXRp7aa	It's to do with changing ratings, (as in bringing in age-specific ratings,) changing attitudes and moral values, and also the introduction of home videos. Ratings became more restrictive, people's morals changed with the times, and once people could get their own copies of films, which were unrated for a while, censorship was a bit pointless.<br>  <br>  As an interesting aside, in Ireland, The Graduate was edited because of its depiction of an extra-marital affair. All the scenes with Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft getting it on were cut, so it made no sense whatsoever!|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	I saw that film Hostel the other week and I swear it gave me nightmares and couldnt get images out of my ghead for a while.  I will not be watching another horror again.  Shouldnt have been allowed that movie at all.  |`|owYyT0AUaa	As with most things, its all about making money.

If you want your IPOD fill with classic song for working, I think you need modern classic performance like Bond (strings), Vanessa Mae (violin) or Nicholas de Angelis (guitar). They makes classic music interesting and enjoyable for you.  Pure classical orchestra like Philharmonic needs a time and quite situation to hear, and not suitable for working.|`|PoTwN4mmaa	try Prometheus by Scriabin:  part 1    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KARiIfbnH...  part 2:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt3_amr3f...

I think it was actually edited and put in a couple of different cartoons / anthologies.    It's not in the original Fantasia.  The Pythagoreum Theorem thing is Donald in Mathemagic Land.  They did have a part about music in there as it relates to math.    Could it be Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom?  that's a short.  it's in a Disney Anthology and in the new Fantasia, according to imdb.    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046442/    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046442/dvd|`|wbkzpYhRaa	Fantasia?|`|rY4Y2NUAaa	it may be Fantasia, we've seen that a few times in music class. its basically clasical music and such recreated with disney characters.

ajlBdO5Raa	I personally like really odd band names. Ones that you have a hard time with because they're so wierd.  I mean, you could call yourselves "    If anyone says "what am I even supposed to call your band", you say "Less Than Three".    Something like that, you know?  Soemthing that's got enough catch to it that it's different and interesting, but something that people are also going to be able to identify easily.    I'm with that other poster, though, who said that you should just go with the flow right now, and not worry so much about the name.  The name will find you.|`|TTaLB4kdaa	I like Confessions of a Fat Kid!|`|LBvWR0YZaa	Astrocats  Rubber Hippo Meets The Big City  Graphic silence|`|Qpy2KQBuaa	You dont look that young.

Im not sure what Im seeing, but it looks a little out of bounds.|`|ensojBFHaa	I don't think the fat kid one would work, unless you were fat kids.    Why don't you just start the band, see how it goes, see what kind of music you come up with and then come up with a name. You'll probably find that one comes out of the blue and it will fit your band better. Most importantly get practising, master your instruments/vocals/songs... the name's the least important thing you need to worry about. Good luck :)|`|feQzknrNaa	Curdled Carcass|`|lWoI0Xwsaa	Doorknob has a darker feel to it. Confessions Of A Fat Kid will get you more noticed though.

But don't get me wrong, Lupe's a great rapper.|`|L6mAGp5Yaa	BTNH & Dre aren't forgotten, what are you talking about? And Lupe is very talented, & I agree some people should stop acting like Pac was God, but Tupac is & has always been one of my favourite rappers.

It's Pac, come on!<br>  Lupe is the ****, one of a kind, and is something the game has been missing but he has yet to reach Pac's level. Plus, the both have different styles of poetry. As far as being a icon of rap Tupac is the biggest ever and i'm not sure if Lupe can eclipse him.|`|uzVBctIbaa	You shouldn't even compare Lupe with Tupac.<br>  Believe me, there's still a lot of people who still listens to him.

IXbmXUcraa	creo que esa canción es original de maná|`|W1o9xqUSaa	Que yo sepa nadie más|`|RwbvRmJmaa	El peruano Manuel Mantilla reclama derechos de autor a Maná <br>  <br>  El compositor peruano Manuel Mantilla reclama los derechos de autor de la melodía del tema "Mariposa Traicionera", grabada por el grupo mexicano Maná en su más reciente producción discográfica. <br>  <br>  Mantilla indicó a la prensa peruana que desea llevar ese asunto con suma prudencia y sin provocar escándalos, por lo que aclaró que no quiere acusar de plagio a Fher Olvera, vocalista del grupo. <br>  <br>  Sin embargo la Asociación Peruana de Autores y Compositores adelantó que denunciará a Maná por el supuesto plagio. Su presidente, Armando Massé, dijo que la banda habría utilizado sin autorización la citada composición musical. <br>  <br>  El compositor peruano explicó que su obra "Traicionera" la compuso en 1977 y fue difundida primero a través del grupo peruano Los Destellos en ritmo de cumbia. <br>  <br>  Posteriormente, el tema fue grabado por el cantante colombiano Pastor López y luego fue editado en México donde alcanzó gran éxito en los a?os '78-'79. <br>  <br>  "La parte que Maná ha tomado de mi obra es la música. Un peritaje realizado por el maestro peruano Oscar Sánchez arroja que la parte fundamental de la melodía 'Traicionera' se usa tres veces en la canción 'Mariposa Traicionera'", se?aló Mantilla. <br>  <br>  Precisó que con "pruebas en la mano" notificará a la Sociedad de Autores y Compositores de México y también a la máxima instancia internacional de protege la obra de los compositores del mundo. <br>  <br>  "Yo no exijo dinero, lo único que pido es que se reconozca mis derechos autorales en el disco de Maná y si no lo hacen en forma voluntaria, se hará por la vía judicial", sentenció. <br>  <br>  La tensión entre Maná y los peruanos ya había tenido un episodio en marzo pasado cuando el líder del grupo mexicano dijo en el Festival de Vi?a del Mar que el pisco sour -aperitivo que los peruanos consideran como suyo- era chileno. El asunto quedó zanjado con una carta de disculpas del grupo y una posterior visita a Lima.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  aqui la letra de "la traicionera"<br>  <br>  Cuando se quiere como te quise<br>  Trata de cerrar la herida que me abriste<br>  No he vuelto a amarte ni a recordarte<br>  Pero yo no puedo ahora olvidarte.<br>  (Oye traicionera aunque yo me muera<br>  Donde yo me encuentre rogaré por tu alma<br>  Oye traicionera aunque me muera<br>  Donde yo me encuentre rogaré por tu alma).<br>  No he vuelto a amarte ni a recordarte<br>  Pero yo no puedo ahora olvidarte<br>    Tú eres la alegría que fue en mi vida<br>  Camino en las noches y no encuentro nada.<br>  (Oye traicionera aunque yo me muera...)<br>  (Oye traicionera aunque yo me muera...)<br>  Cuando se quiere como te quise...<br>  (Oye traicionera aunque yo me muera...)<br>  (Oye traicionera aunque yo me muera...) <br>  <br>  <br>  y el video de la cancion "plagiada"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcdZFYnTUwE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcdZFYnTU...</a>
