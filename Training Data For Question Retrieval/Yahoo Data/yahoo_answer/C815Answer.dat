02e43eb2760171b98a8053f0c0b26497aa	I agree that Stevia leaves a strange after taste, I'd say not as bad as Splenda, Equal,or Sweet & Low. But I've found that using a flavors tea masks that, I like Stevia with a mint tea in the morning I can barely taste any thing but the mint. I'd dont know how much you use but I'm a strong tea drinker.. Like three tea bags in one cup of hot water then 3 tablespoons Stevia and pour that over one cup of ice.<br>  If that not appealing just try asking at the health food store I know ther are some asia surgar subs. out there Lo Han Guo ... its natual and very sweet and a lil fruity. not FDA approved that i know.|`|0vfX40Qxaa	You can't,  the best you can do is cut back, try a Splenda/Sugar, or Stevia/Sugar blend, that may help with the after taste.|`|OtDms9wEaa	Try other teas like Green Tea.

You can stretch them a bit if you have a salad with them or a side dish.<br>  <br>  This is you grocery list, assuming you already have flour, salt and pepper, milk and butter or margarine in your house: I shop at Save-a-Lot so the prices are Save-a-Lot prices, if you don't have a Save-a-Lot in your area you will need to find an equivalent bag-your-own groceries type store or buy store brand, in which case your total may be slightly higher.<br>  <br>  1 Whole Chicken - $4.50 or $4.90 for ten lbs. of chicken legs and thighs at Wal-Mart<br>  1 bag rice - 99 cents<br>  2 cans mushrooms - 49 cents each = .98 cents<br>  3 cans mixed vegetables - 39 cents each = $1.17<br>  1 can peas 39 cents<br>  1 can tuna - 79 cents<br>  5 cans mushroom soup - 49 cents each = $2.45<br>  1 package of tortillas - 79 cents<br>  1 bottle ranch dressing - 99 cents<br>  1 dozen eggs - 79 cents<br>  1 package egg noodles - 79 cents<br>  1 box Velveeta or So Cheesy - $3.99<br>  2 boxes of Macaroni - 89 cents each = $1.78<br>  4 cans diced tomatoes - 49 cents each = $1.96<br>  <br>  If it is in your budget, here are additional ingredients for an additional meal:<br>  <br>  1 pkg. of 8 burritos $2.49<br>  1 can of chili $1.79 (or ingredients to make your own are cheap and you can have chili once and save the leftover chili to use in this recipe.)<br>  1 can of diced tomatoes with or without garlic and basil - 49 cents<br>  1 pkg. shredded Mexican cheese $2.49<br>  Optional Salsa $1.39 and Sour Cream $1.39 for topping<br>  <br>  Chicken should be cooked first as follows:<br>  <br>  You will boil the chicken until it is falling off the bones, adding water as needed and dumping broth into separate container and adding more water to get plenty of broth.<br>  <br>  You will set aside 2 portions of broth, a larger portion for the soup and a smaller portion for the Rivels. When you tear the chicken up you will put some nice pieces aside for the chicken tortilla recipe, some decent pieces for the soup, and the lesser pieces with fat and such for the Rivels. <br>  <br>  Rice, Mushroom Soup, and Chicken<br>  Put water in a large 2 qt. pan, a little over ? full and bring to boil. Squeeze bag of rice in middle and pour half of rice into pan. Seal up the remaining half for another recipe later. Now cook this rice with the lid off and stirring it occasionally so the rice will be gummy and have too much water. After about 20 minutes the rice will be fully cooked and you will add 2 cans of mushroom soup and the chicken pieces you set aside from the chicken for this recipe. Turn heat down to low. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir it up and just let it cook long enough to warm up the added ingredients and serve. The remaining water should've been absorbed by the mushroom soup and chicken, making it a nice consistency. If it is still too watery you can sprinkle in a little mashed potato flakes to absorb any remaining liquid. This recipe is also quite good with tuna instead of chicken for variety.<br>  <br>  Homemade Chicken Mushroom Soup<br>  <br>  Heat the chicken broth you set aside for this recipe and add the chicken also set aside for this recipe. Add two cans of mushroom soup, 2 cans mushrooms, and three cans of mixed vegetables. Mix flour and water and add to boiling soup to thicken it. Season to taste. If you have any leftovers that would fit well in this recipe go ahead and add them unless they are needed for another recipe later. You can divide the second half of the bag of rice up, using half for this recipe and half for the chicken tortillas if you wish. (You should cook the rice according to package directions prior to adding it to the soup.)<br>  <br>  Chicken Tortillas<br>  <br>  Using the nice pieces of chicken you should sear them in oil or butter, mix in the remaining half or fourth of the bag of rice, (cooked) depending rather or not you used any in the soup, and stir it up. Now lay out a tortilla and put some chicken and rice in a line on one side and add ranch dressing and roll it up.<br>  <br>  Rivels<br>  <br>  Using the broth you set aside for this recipe you should measure it and then bring it to a boil. Now take one cup of flour and one egg for each cup of broth. Mix to a powdery consistency and add to the boiling chicken broth. Add the chicken pieces, salt and pepper to taste.<br>  <br>  Tuna Noodle Casserole<br>  <br>  Cook the egg noodles. Drain. Add one can mushroom soup, one can of peas, drained, and one can of tuna, drained. I always break the tuna up well between my fingers, making sure there are no bones and helping it to distribute better around the casserole. Salt and pepper to taste.<br>  <br>  Macaroni, Cheese and Tomato Casserole<br>  <br>  You have enough ingredients to make a large batch of this twice, you should freeze some up for use in between other meals to break up the monotony.<br>  <br>  Simply cook and drain 1 box of macaroni. Add butter and half the box of Velveeta, chopped up small to melt faster, and 2 cans of diced tomatoes. Salt and pepper to taste. (You can add peas if your family lik

Both are made from the sangiovese grape although in the village of montalcino, they call it the brunello grape. Brunello's are big wines capable of long aging. They are much more expensive than chianti. <br>  Barolo,on the other hand, is vinified from the nebbiolo grape in the piemonte region of northern Italy. They too are big,expensive wines that can be aged for many years.  Ultimately, If you like a wine , it's a good wine.  I hope this helped.|`|vG0tsqJtaa	Riesling|`|AA12320776	all of the above

Rub with olive oil, sprinkle with unrefined sea salt(it's healthy and tastes much better) and fresh ground pepper. It would be ideal to cook them on a fire made with grape vines as they do in Spain.  Most of us don't have any grape vine clippings handy, but it also works well with a charcoal fire with some fresh rosemary thrown in.  Lamb chops are expensive, treat them with the respect they deserve and you soon will be enjoying a very delicious meal.|`|9CN0otoQaa	Grill, broil, pan fry, the same as you would any chop.

Also if you can find the mini-gram cracker pre-made pie crusts, you can make miniature key-lime pies. I would do that. For the key lime part, get real key-lime juice, condensed milk and cool-whip, not the fat free type!!

b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Tofu belongs in your vegetarian kitchen because it is power packed with protein, is amazingly versatile, has health benefits and can be inexpensive if you purchase it in the right places. We all can benefit from getting to know it better. Most of the people who claim that tofu “tastes funny” really mean that tofu doesn’t taste like anything they’re familiar with, or that it has no distinct flavor of its own and is really rather bland. They also mean that its texture is smooth and rather uninteresting. And all that is true. It is also why it is so very versatile and why it excites the inventive, adventurous cook in your vegetarian kitchen. Tofu begs you to play with it, be creative with it, have fun with it. It will go where you want it to go and do what you want it to do, picking up flavor and texture along the way.<br>  <br>  Frequently people who have enjoyed meals prepared by a person who knows what to do with this marvelous food, do not realize that they are eating tofu at all. They simply marvel at the wonderful flavors and textures of the meal and heap kudos on the terrific cook. You can trust me on this, I have been doing it for decades!<br>  <br>  Tofu really is amazing and the ideas are endless! Here is a brief on its history and use. While growing in popularity in these United States recently, Tofu has been a staple in Asia for thousands of years. This amazing soy food was first crafted in about 164 B.C. by Lord Liu An, a famous Taoist vegetarian, philosopher and mystic. For more than 2000 years it has had a prominent place in Chinese cuisine. It reached Japan a thousand years later when Buddhist Monks crossed the China Sea. Being vegetarian, they introduced this wonderful soy food to the general public, popularizing it along with their Zen practice.<br>  <br>  Made of soy ‘milk’, Tofu provides a source of inexpensive, readily available, easily digestible, high protein for vegetarians. Additionally, since it is bland and has no distinctive flavor of its own, it is remarkably versatile and lends itself easily to every part of the meal from appetizers, through soups, salads and salad dressings, to the entrees and finally -- even the desserts. It can also be used to ‘bind’ other ingredients together as in Lentil Patties, Oat Burgers, or your-vegetarian-kitchen.com  's Maryland Not Crab Cakes. <br>  Tofu is available in a wide variety of textures, from extra firm, to firm to soft and silken. This designation is pretty much determined by its moisture content. Each variety has its own unique quality and uses in your vegetarian kitchen. These several varieties are not, however, interchangeable. Extra Firm Tofu is a wonderful choice for recipes that require firm, well defined shapes like our Tofu Cutlets or Tex-Mex Love Boats; Firm Tofu works well in recipes that call for crumbling, like our Tofu Rancheros or No-Egg Salad; Soft Tofu is lovely in our Carrot Coriander Tofu Quiche, or deviled Tofu Eggs; and Silken Tofu is a superb choice for creamy vegan soups, salad dressings and desserts.<br>  <br>  In other words, the texture of the tofu you select depends on what you want to do with it. If you are preparing a sauce or creamy soup, a dessert or salad dressing in your vegetarian kitchen use silken tofu. If you want to grill it, prepare cutlets, or some stuffed tofu like our Rock Cornish Game Stuffed Tofu, then you’ll select extra firm tofu. Soft tofu is great when you want to prepare Tofu Rancheros or Scrambled Tofu for Breakfast or Brunch. Tofu “No-Egg” Salad or our Luna Salad can be made with either soft or firm tofu.<br>  <br>  Tofu becomes sponge-like and chewy when you freeze it. As it freezes it develops little channel-like tunnels which make it perfect to soak up a marinade or a barbeque sauce. In the interest of the presentation of your dish, it is best to cut the tofu into cubes before you freeze it, for then, as it thaws and as it cooks, it will retain its attractive shape.<br>  <br>  Some companies have produced tofu which is already flavored for you, such as Nasoya’s Five Spice Tofu or their Garlic and Herb Tofu. In a pinch, when soft or silken tofu are not available, you can purée firm or extra firm tofu. However, the texture will be grainy and less than ideal. No matter which texture you choose to work with, in short order, you will find tofu to be one of the staple items in your vegetarian kitchen.<br>  <br>  However, please note: If you have unused tofu left over from the water pack it comes in be sure to cover it with pure Spring or  RO Water and sealing it from the air replace it in the refrigerator. You can keep tofu in this state for the better part of aweek if you change the water daily and keep it refrigerated.|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	It is solidified soy milk.  That's all.<br>  <br>  You take some soymilk, then you add something to it to make it coagulate (firm up).  Something such as gypsum (Chinese; usually listed as "calcium sulphate" on ingredients) or nigari (Japanese; usually listed as "Magnesium chloride" on ingredients).<br>  <br>  Gypsum is the same stuff blackboard chalk and drywall is made from.<br>  Nigari is an extract of sea water, left over after the salt (sodium chloride) has been removed and the water evaporated.|`|7o3DMzXQaa	bean curd|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	What is Tofu?<br>  There is no such thing as just plain "tofu." It comes in a variety of textures, hardness, and flavors. There are several very different textures of tofu available in markets today: <br>  Tofu Types<br>  Regular Tofu: This texture resembles a sponge and is fibrous with a silken texture. In most cases, when a recipe calls for just "tofu," it is a safe bet to use this texture. Note that manufacturers do not use the term "regular" for this tofu. They'll typically call it "tofu soft, medium firm." <br>  Soft Tofu: For regular textured tofu, this hardness is similar to a soft water-logged sponge with really small holes. We know this does not sound appealing, but we're only describing the hardness, not the flavor. For silken textured tofu, this hardness is similar to really soft jello. In many cases, however, soft silken tofu will just have the label of "silken."<br>  <br>  Firm Tofu: For regular textured tofu, this hardness is denser -- similar to a firmer water-logged sponge with small holes. And for silken textured tofu, the jello consistency just gets firmer.<br>  <br>  A hardness cannot be made any softer but it can be made firmer by freezing and thawing, boiling in water, or pressing. These three methods change the texture of the tofu in different ways.<br>  <br>  Freezing & Thawing: Freezing and thawing makes the tofu more porous so that it soaks marinades and other liquids very quickly. For additional information on freezing and thawing tofu, see "Storage" in this article.<br>  <br>  Boiling: When boiling tofu, the outside is cooked more than the inside, causing the outside edges to be a little tougher. This may be exactly what you want when using tofu as a meat alternative. A typical boiling time is 20 minutes; however, boiling it for longer or shorter periods of time certainly will not hurt it.<br>  <br>  Pressing: Pressing tofu makes the entire block uniformly firmer. This is the technique to use if a recipe calls for firm tofu and you happen to have soft tofu in the refrigerator. To press a block of tofu, place it between towels and put a heavy weight (such as a cast iron frying pan, concrete paving blocks, or bricks) on top and let it sit for an hour or so. Storing or cooking pressed tofu in a liquid will undo the effects of the pressing.<br>  <br>  You are not limited to just one of these techniques to change the hardness of your tofu. You can use any combination of them or all three. You can even repeat any of the techniques or combinations to really toughen up your tofu. When you go to your local health food store, you may notice a wide variety of tofus flavored with herbs. These are not what the authors of your recipe books are referring to unless, of course, they've specified a particular flavor of tofu. Feel free to try these flavored tofu treats in your own creative recipes.<br>  <br>  Nigari/Calcium Rich/GDL (Glucono Delta Lactone)<br>  Nigari is a natural component of sea water, primarily magnesium chloride.  It is used to make Japanese style tofu.  Nigari tofu are generally firmer and more tender.  <br>  <br>  Calcium Rich tofu is make with food grade gypsum, a natural earth mineral, calcium sulfate.  It is traditional Chinese tofu ingredient.  The Calcium Rich tofu is softer and smoother.  <br>  <br>  GDL Tofu is silken tofu.  GDL is mixed with the soymilk in the tofu container.  The coagulation takes place inside the tofu container.  The tofu is never pressed.  Therefore, silken tofu has the highest water content.  This make silken tofu soft. <br>  <br>  Certified Organic:<br>  What is Organic?<br>  Organic refers to methods of growing and processing foods that rely on the earth's natural resources. Pests and weeds are managed using earth-friendly means such as beneficial insects and mechanical controls. Organic farmers work to build natural nutrients in soil which help fertilize plants without reliance on synthetic fertilizers.  For details of the California Organic Food Acts of 1990, click here.<br>  <br>  Organic Production<br>  Offers food produced within nature's own balanced and fertile system.<br>  <br>   Helps keep our air, soil, and water free of toxic chemicals.  <br>   Ensures that animals are humanely raised, without synthetic hormones or antibiotics, and only fed organic feed. <br>  <br>  All Quong Hop's soy products are made with certified organic soybean.<br>  <br>  Freshness/Quality<br>  Fresh tofu should have a mild smell when you open the package. A package of tofu should show an expiration date. <br>  Tofu that has spoiled turns moldy, is filmy to the touch, and has a sour, sharp, or biting taste and smell. Some suggest that if it only smells sour, it can still be used in many recipes other than those with very delicate flavors such as mousses and puddings.

Also, make sure you are using sushi rice.  Spread the rice out on a flat surface to cool.  Sprinkle with sushi vinegar.  The sushi should be fairly sticky.|`|VdnAH78Xaa	its supposed to have a really sticky texture.<br>  and yes let it cool before your use it|`|AA11015885	SUSHI RICE RECIPE  (You are missing the Vinegar mixture and the fanning process in your procedure).<br>  Often, up to 80% of product consumed during a sushi meal is rice. Getting your sushi rice right is a crucial element in successful sushi making at home. The proper preparation of the rice is so important that in our shop as well as most quality establishments there are chefs whose sole responsibility is to cook the rice.<br>  <br>  Let's Begin<br>  If you do not have a Japanese rice cooker, a heavy pot with lid is essential( I like Lagostina cookware). One secret is to always measure your ingredients carefully. Following is a basic sushi rice recipe for rolled sushi. Also, the type of rice you use is most important.<br>  <br>  We recommend the following brands: Kokuho Rose, Tamaki Gold, Tamanishiki, Nozomi and Yume.<br>  <br>  Prepare Your Tezu<br>  Your first step is to prepare your vinegar-water solution called tezu. Mix together 250 ml of water, 30 ml of rice vinegar (Marukan and Mitsukan are excellent) and 5 ml of salt.<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  (yields - 4 large rolls [futomaki] or 10 small rolls [hosomaki]) 500 ml Sushi Rice<br>  600 ml Water<br>  60 ml Rice Vinegar<br>  30 ml Sugar<br>  5 ml Salt<br>  <br>  Wash The Rice<br>  Wash the rice several times until the water runs fairly clear when draining. Let your wash rice strain for 30 minutes. Transfer the rice to your pot or Japanese electric rice cooker and add the measured water. <br>  <br>  Cook The Rice<br>  For electric rice cookers, turn on and wait for rice to finish cooking. For stove top cooking heat to boiling , cover tightly and simmer at lowest heat allowing the rice to steam for 18 minutes. You must leave it covered... no peaking! <br>  <br>  Remove your pot from the heat and let stand covered for another 15 minutes. <br>  <br>  Prepare Your Sushi Vinegar<br>  Mix the vinegar, sugar and salt together in a small saucepan. Heat the mixture until the sugar dissolves, stirring frequently. Remove from heat and let your sushi vinegar cool to room temperature. <br>  <br>  Take a wooden spatula or spoon and cut and fold the rice. Be gentle as you do not want to smash the cooked grains. <br>  <br>  Prepare Your Mixing Bowl<br>  Moisten your bowl with a cloth dampened with your TEZU mixture. The traditional bowl to use is the flat-bottomed wooden sushi oke or hangiri. The porous wood absorbs excess moisture and the large surface allows the rice to cool more quickly and evenly. <br>  <br>  Put the hot rice into your mixing bowl and add 1/4 of the sushi vinegar solution. Mix with a folding motion so as to not smash your perfect sushi rice. Repeat until all sushi vinegar is used. <br>  <br>  Fan Your Rice<br>  After mixing, fan [electric fan will work] the hot rice mixture for about 5 or 6 minutes in order to remove excess moisture and create a glossy shine to your rice. Your rice should have a slight chewiness and be sticky to the touch.<br>  <br>  You're Done<br>  Voila! Perfect sushi rice – ready for rolling!|`|betBso6vaa	first, look at the directions for the rice, if its gloppy, that means your adding too much water. and yes u must cool the rice|`|AA10698792	Yes, most short grain rices have more starch than medium or long grain and tend to be sticky (like arborio rice used for risotto).  If you're using the rice to make sushi, you're skipping a crucial step, you have to add rice vinegar after the rice has cooled and fold it into the rice.

From that point  everything is optional, my version: <br>  1 can tuna<br>  1 Tablespoon sweet relish<br>  1 stalk celery chopped<br>  1 boiled egg chopped<br>  enough mayo to give the thickness you desire<br>  seasoning salt or spices of your choice, I sometimes use Cajun seasoning or Old Bay|`|wLgGD63raa	I've been wanting to try this recipe out myself.<br>  <br>  FOCCACIA PANINO<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>   * 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br>   * 2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1/2 lemon)<br>   * 2 cans Italian tuna, drained<br>   * 1/4 teaspoon salt<br>   * 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br>   * 4 (4 by 4-inch) pieces focaccia bread<br>   * 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for greasing the panino pan<br>   * 8 slices provolone cheese<br>   * 1 bunch frisee lettuce, washed and dried<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  In a medium bowl, mix together the mayonnaise and the lemon juice. Add the tuna, salt, and pepper, and stir to combine.<br>  <br>  Cut the focaccia in half and brush the outside of the bread with olive oil. Place a slice of cheese on the bottom half of the panino. Top with tuna mixture, then the frisee, and then another slice of cheese. Finish with the top half of the focaccia.<br>  <br>  Preheat a panino grill, or heat a grill pan over medium heat. Drizzle with olive oil to prevent sticking. Grill the panino until the cheese melts and the bread is crisp and golden, about 5 minutes. Cut the panino in half and serve.<br>  <br>  <br>  Substitutions:<br>  <br>  If you do not have a "panino maker," put the sandwich in a pan, and put another pan on top of the sandwich, it works just as good. You can also substitute the foccacia bread for any kind of crusty or hard bread. You can also use whatever cheese you wish, and you definitely don't need Italian tuna, any canned tuna is fine. You don't need frisee lettuce either, any lettuce will do just fine. Or eliminate it altogether.|`|yXno8yIkaa	I like a bit of chopped green onion, celery, grated carrot, lemon pepper, a drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp spicy mustard and 1 tablespoon miracle whip.<br>  <br>  <br>  You pretty much have to eat a tuna sandwich not long after making it, tuna will make the bread soggy.

Other things you can add if you like them are pickle relish, diced onion, diced celery, diced water chestnuts or slivered almonds.<br>  <br>  Personally, I just like the pickle relish.<br>  <br>  Also, if you butter both pieces of the bread, it won't get soggy.|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	Drain the tuna all the way.

FHi0v36eaa	You can buy the canned stuff. <br>  <br>  But if you really want to make it home made, I would go out and get some spaghetti noodles, and some tomato sauce. Boil some water in a large pot, then put in the noodles when the water comes to a boil. Once the pasta is soft, take it out. You might want to heat up the sauce in another pot, put it on low until it is hot then add to the noodles, and you have spaghetti!|`|AA12327715	There are cans of spaghetti you can buy at the store. Just open the can, put it in a bowl, and microwave. <br>  <br>  If you want to actually COOK simple spaghetti though, just buy some spaghetti noodles and a can of Prego, Ragu, or some other sauce in a jar. Just boil some water, put the noodles in, let them boil for about 10 minutes (stirring occasionally), then strain the water from the noodles. For the sauce, you can either put it on at room temperature by just opening the jar and putting it on the noodles. Or you can cook the sauce by putting it in a sauce pan on the stove and heating it up (stirring occasionally) until it's warm enough for your preference. You could microwave the sauce as  well if you wish, just make sure you cover the bowl since spaghetti sauce tends to splatter... a lot.<br>  <br>  Last but not least: If you like Parmesan cheese, just buy the little shakers of it and shake it onto the spaghetti. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Boil the pasta until al dente.

Then open a can of spaghetti sauce, pour it over the noodles, and enjoy! If you don't have spaghetti sauce or want a cheaper alternative, just add sugar to plain tomato sauce, about 1 teaspoon of sugar per 2 cups of tomato sauce. From there you can add other spices to taste like italian seasoning and paprika and salt etc, or you can just eat it with sugar.

This can be prepared mostly the night before and leave the crock pot on low in the morn before leaving for work.<br>  <br>  How about splitting and grilling Game Hens (you can do this a day in advance and cover tightly with foil and reheat in the oven - add 4 Tablespoons water to roasting pan and you can pile the critters however they fit - don't split the ones for big eaters all the way up the back so they stay together to serve - I would allow a half game hen for light eaters and a whole for big eaters depending on how large the game hens are).  Then  do scalloped potatoes in your crock pot (see below) and serve with a big tossed green salad with lots of variety of vegies - cukes, tomatoes, leeks, a few garbanzos, carrot curls, sliced celery, sliced mushrooms etc  This will be very different from what you've been doing and will get raves guaranteed.<br>  <br>  This is our favorite salad dressing for a big change - Take a pint of whipping cream (though with 6 you might want to double this as people really eat it!), finely chop 1/4 cup green onions, 2 clove garlics minced, 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper, grated or crumbled cheese of your choice.  Stir well or if you like you can put it in food processor or blender to make it like velvet.  We like it with blue cheese, white cheddar, mexican jack etc.<br>  <br>  *Scalloped Potatoes<br>  (You can prep this the night before.)<br>  Peel and slice into rounds a large potato per person.  Layer in crock pot with salt, butter pats and a tablespoon of flour for each layer.  When crock pot is 3/4 full pour 1-2 cans of evap milk over all. (I don't know what size crock pot you have so..) Then 45 min before serving - add  1/2 pound of Mexican Cheese and stir gently,  When cheese is melted and bubbly, stir again.  There should be a good amount of liquid in the crock pot.<br>  <br>  So you come home - add the cheese to crock pot - preheat the oven to 275-300 and put the game hens in the oven - make sure they are very securely, tightly sealed.  Leave them in until ready to serve.  They will need to heat about an hour at 300 - don't forget to add the water to the bottom of the pan.  You can make the salad the night before or not.  If you do, you whip out the salad and the homemade dressing and there you go.  I usually serve this with hot garlic french bread.<br>  <br>  Always raves.|`|tFoFchuEaa	Try making a lasagna from scratch.

You could have them help you decorate small cakes that you premade if this would be easier. You can find pretty cheap aprons at your local craft store like Michael's or Joann's and have them decorate them with felt pens as an activity beforehand.<br>  <br>  I have also seen this incorporated into an "Art" theme. They still did the aprons but made paintings for the activity. You can make your cake with the rainbow cake mix and decorate it to look like an art palette on top.|`|zTLuK65laa	I know how you feel. My cousin turned 7 last year. That's right on the edge of little girl and big girl. For her birthday, we had a costume party. She dressed up like a princess, and ten of her friends came, also dressed up. First, limit the guests. No more than 15, because if it's more, you will go crazy! Trust me. Second, ask your daughter what she wants to do. Make a homemade cake. You can layer the cake, too, which will make your daughter feel extra special. For favors, buy little plastic crowns, or ribbons. They are only about 1 dollar each. There is so much you can do at a costume party! Have fun with it! I know of a great book you can read, but I am not sure of the title. It's from an American Girl book, and it's something like Party Palooza. Try that. The ideas are always afforable, and designed for all ages.

Some of the fruit and vegetables that we eat - potatoes, tomatoes, oranges, lemons - did not reach Greece until much later.  The Greeks had no sugar - honey was used to sweeten things instead - and no tea, coffee or chocolate.  Milk was made into cheese, but not butter.

This is a critical step.   Use butter (not oil).   Melt butter first.    Whisk the butter as you pour it in the liquid ingredients so to create hundreds of tiny pieces of butter that resolidify when added to the cold milk and eggs.   These tiny butter pieces melt when cooking the pancakes and are in my eyes the most important step<br>  <br>  When you combine the liquid ingredients into the solid, stir gently ONLY ENOUGH TO INCORPORATE.   By not overworking the batter, you avoid working the gluten.    Overstirring creates a tougher pancake<br>  <br>  Let the batter rest for 1 hour at a minimum (making them at night and allowing for an overnight rest is even better)<br>  <br>  When you cook the pancake, wait until the top of the pancake is pocked with tiny air holes all over before you flip it.   And only flip it once. <br>  <br>  The 2nd side cooks in about 1/2 the time. <br>  <br>  Do this and you will create a great pancake.|`|AA10928232	The Best Buttermilk Pancakes<br>  <br>  2 cups Buttermilk**<br>  3 eggs, room temp<br>  6 Tbsp butter, melted<br>  2 cups all purpose flour<br>  1 tsp salt<br>  2 tsp baking soda<br>  1 tsp. vanilla<br>  <br>  Put the buttermilk, egg and melted butter in a mixing bowl.

t5xnbgKkaa	For a good, simple vegetable stock take<br>   2  medium sized onions, peel and cut in quarters,<br>   1 large carrot, peel and cut in chunks,<br>   2 sticks of celery, top and tail and chop in half,<br>   1 clove of garlic chopped in half or whole,<br>   2 teaspoons of dried mixed herbs (use supermarkets own brand)<br>   1 quarter teaspoon of ground black pepper and a pinch of salt.<br>  <br>  Pour a little vegetable oil into a saucepan and add all the veggies, fry gently for a couple of minutes and then add the herbs, pepper and salt and turn over everything to coat. Pour over a pint and a half or water and bring to the boil, then leave it to simmer and reduce by at least half and no more than two thirds. remove the vegetables and discard them. You can add almost any other vegetables you want and use up things like the hard core in the centre of a white cabbage this way, also the bottoms of asparagus stalks if you like the flavor and any sweet pepper that have gone a little limp in the fridge..just trim and seed them first and the in they go with everything else...increasing the amount of water a little for the added volume of vegetables. You can keep this stock for several days in the fridge or freeze it for up to a month and probably longer than that. As it has only a little salt and no Mono-sodium glutamate (flavor enhancer) in it the stock is not as strong tasting as a cube but you will learn to adjust the ingredients to suit your own sense of taste and to enjoy food that does not taste mostly of salt.<br>  For a meat stock, use the vegetables as above but add a chicken carcass left over from sunday dinner or whenever; or the bones from a shoulder or leg of lamb, beef or pork.and then cook in the same way, adding more water but aiming for a pint of liquid in the end.strain, cool and freeze or keep in the fridge for two or three days.<br>  If you get desperate then there are some organic stock cubes to be had, the Kallo range are pretty good but I have learned to prefer my own stocks.|`|3mEljYF6aa	personally i think making stock is a pain in the @ss but if you want to do it here goes..<br>  You need some bones of whatever animal it is you wish to eat. If u want brown stock ie. for beef you need to roast the bones in the oven in order to get colour.<br>  Put bones in large pan and just cover with water bring to the boil and skim off scum. When scum stops rising you can add halved onions, chopped carrots, chopped celery stalk, peppercorns and a bouquet garne. Cover pan and simmer until liquid is reduced by half. Strain the stock then cool and remove fat.<br>  If you just want veg stock bung a load of veg in pan instead and simmer for 45 mins.<br>  There are really good ready made stocks available now.

Basically with stocks you just simmer whatever for a long time.  Chicken stock: simmer chicken in water.  Veggie stock: simmer veggies in water.  Often for meats, the bones are used because they are what's left over, but you can have a more flavourful stock if you simmer some meat too.  But then you have to eat the meat, or put it in the soup.<br>  <br>  It's easier, at least for me, to just buy ready-made stock in the grocery store.

Prepare the filling: Separate the eggs, placing the whites in a medium-size mixing bowl and the yolks in a large mixing bowl. Set the yolks aside. Add the almond extract to the egg whites and beat with an electric mixer on high speed until frothy, 30 seconds. Gradually add the sugar while beating at high speed until soft peaks form, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Fold in the coconut and flour until just incorporated. Set the bowl aside while you prepare the cake.<br>  <br>  2. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

The batter should look thick and well combined.<br>  <br>  4. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan. Spoon the <br>  macaroon filling in a ring on top of the batter, making sure it does not touch the sides of the pan. Spoon the remaining batter over the filling, smoothing it out with the rubber spatula. Place the pan in the oven.<br>  <br>  5. Bake the cake until it springs back when lightly pressed with your finger and is just starting to pull away from the sides of the pan, 53 to 57 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and place it on a wire rack to cool for 20 minutes. Run a long, sharp knife around the edge of the cake and invert it onto a rack to cool completely, 20 minutes more.<br>  <br>  6. For the glaze, place the confectioners' sugar in a small bowl and whisk in enough milk to make a spoonable mixture. Whisk in the almond extract.<br>  <br>  7.

You take the cake mix and prepare it according to the instructions. Once you pour it in your lightly greased/floured pan pour a can of cherries on top. Smooth them out evenly. When you're done cooking, the cherries will have sunk to the bottom and leave the cherry juice throughout the cake. Sprinkle powdered sugar on top. No icing. Trust me, it is DELISH!!!

I couldn't give the habit up. So I prayed to God.<br>  <br>  My prayer was this:- If there is such a thing as a God - You take my  smoking habit from me. I'll not put cigarette to my mouth again. Nor<br>  have I. <br>  <br>  This prayer was at the midnight hour, when I woke up: -  I was clear as a bell.  A keen sense of smell, no sore throat, no continuous coughing,<br>  no burning stomach. And overjoyed and grateful to God, and I still am.<br>  <br>  Years later I realised I had made a covenant with God, for I had under-<br>  taken to keep a promise to God, and my habit was delivered. And if you wish to do likewise, before praying search yourself, (do I retain a<br>  desire to have tiny impulse to smoke now and again). God knows you better than you know yourself.<br>  <br>  I realise a lot of smokers have got away with murder, and a lot more<br>  have not, it's not for me tell you how to lead your lives. But I sure as will give my 'Testimony' of God, for I am grateful to Him.<br>  <br>  Bless You All.<br>  <br>  Pee - Wee|`|rIFqv8nvaa	Number 7 reds, export a greens, john players special.<br>  Marlboro reds, camels full flavor<br>  Any unfilter, and yes they still sell unfiltered in some places.|`|dBEgYeHQaa	full strength? the ones you roll yourself<br>  but if already rolled ciggs, i think and i smoke Marlboro reds are the strongest ciggs|`|tNpnd7k1aa	Learn how to roll cigarettes and smoke Drum without a filter. it's shockingly strong|`|sPScyaF6aa	Cigarettes kill.|`|IPoaeWXPaa	I work for a cigarette company, most companies have one 'stronger' brand e.g Imperials strongest cigarettes are probably embassy, gallahers strongest are probably benson and hedges gold, marlboro are a self owned company and the strongest they have are the red.<br>  <br>  Just out of curiousity, why are u wondering??|`|Lk0CN64Daa	Hm..B&H Gold..or Silver, Rollies are not stronger unless you really pack it.

Preheat the oven to 160°C/320°F/gas 2<br>  ? Break up the chocolate, put it into a food processor with the butter, sugar, almonds, 1 tablespoon of the cocoa powder and the salt, and whiz until smooth<br>  ? Crack your eggs, one at a time, into the food processor and add the flour<br>  ? Whiz again until smooth<br>  <br>  To bake your cake<br>  ? Get a deep baking dish roughly 25 x 25cm in size<br>  ? Butter the dish really well and sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder over it<br>  ? Shake it around a bit so it lightly coats the whole surface of the dish<br>  ? Pour the cake mixture into the dish, using a spatula to scrape it all out of the processor<br>  ? Break the fudge into pieces and sprinkle these over the top of the cake mix, pushing any larger pieces down into the mixture<br>  ? Pop the baking dish into the preheated oven and cook for 18 to 20 minutes<br>  ? Take the cake out of the oven and stick a fork into the middle of it<br>  ? If there’s a little bit of cake mixture on the fork when you pull it out, that’s okay – you want the cake to still be a little moist inside so that it’s nice and squidgy<br>  ? However, if it seems a bit wobbly, pop it back into the oven for another 3 to 5 minutes to firm up a bit<br>  <br>  To serve your cake<br>  ?

Butter and line the bottom of 2 (8-inch) cake pans. <br>  <br>  In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugars, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In another bowl or wide-necked measuring cup whisk together the eggs, sour cream and vanilla until blended. Using a standing or handheld electric mixer, beat together the melted butter and corn oil until just blended (you'll need another large bowl for this is using the hand mixer; the standing mixer comes with its own bowl), then beat in the water. Add the dry ingredients all at once and mix together on a slow speed. Add the egg mixture, and mix again until everything is blended and then pour into the prepared tins. And actually, you could easily do this manually; I just like my toys and find the stand mixer a comforting presence in itself. <br>  <br>  Bake the cakes for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a cake-tester comes out clean. Cool the cakes in their pans on a wire rack for 15 minutes, and then turn the cakes out on the rack to cool completely. <br>  <br>  For the icing:<br>  Melt the chocolate in the microwave - 2 to 3 minutes on medium should do it - or in a bowl sitting over a pan of simmering water, and let cool slightly. <br>  <br>  In another bowl beat the butter until it's soft and creamy (again, I use the stand mixer here) and then add the sifted confectioners' sugar and beat again until everything's light and fluffy. I know sifting is a pain, the 1 job in the kitchen I really hate, but you have to do it or the icing will be unsoothingly lumpy. Then gently add the vanilla and chocolate and mix together until everything is glossy and smooth. <br>  <br>  Sandwich the middle of the cake with about a quarter of the icing, and then ice the top and sides, too, spreading and smoothing with a rubber spatula.

Stir in green onion and parsley; cook until the green onion has softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for 3 minutes more, stirring constantly. <br>  Pour in the cream, increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Once the cream comes to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low and whisk in the shredded Swiss and Parmesan cheeses. Slowly simmer, uncovered, until the sauce has thickened, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.|`|yXno8yIkaa	I like whole wheat pasta with a store bought cheese alfredo sauce, you can add veggies, to make it healthier,  onion, broccoli, mushrooms, tomaotes and fresh basil go great with the sauce.|`|jHcblhmVaa	Put your own herbs in.  You can add some bullion they have vegetable bullion as well as chicken and beef, even fish.  Just watch the sodium in it.  But you will be able to add as much or as little as you want. Saute your pasta just a bit in olive oil or butter but I wouldn't recommend margarine because of the hydrogenated oil in it. After you have browned your pasta add the rice, again any type or types you like.  Even china black a wonderful nutty flavored rice.  Hard to find but it tastes great and cooks just about like long grain white rice.  Add your water and bullion, if it is a cube smash it up so it isn't in just one part of your dish.  Then add the spices you like, sodium free, then you can add as much as you want.  You can also add fresh herbs like onion, garlic, scallions, sage rosemary, etc.  Add dry spices with the water, and the, fresh later on.  You may not make it perfect the first time but keep trying, and you will find the cost/ serving will go down. This will take just a little more time but you are in control, and your imagination can carry you much farther than a box in the cupboard.  Good luck.|`|geih5vR8aa	Check the back of the box and see what ingredients they use.<br>  <br>  Butter, Parmesan cheese, cream or milk, flat leaf parsley and a little oregano, salt and pepper...

Hope this helps! ^_^|`|Ztgxd5Jiaa	what you eat starbucks you will never find it any were else only make it.<br>  p.s it like crack so don't get hocked

It tasted like a cheeseburger. Yum.|`|b8c32d57b4a1336f94b426a5879ff6f7aa	I have used it. I use about 1 cup + 2 slices of dried bread in my meatloaf. You can always break it down a bit in a baggie and a rolling pin. I would use 1/2 of a cup instead of 1 slice of bread.|`|AA12029875	my mother always did because it absorbs the flavor better. Use whatever amount you need, the more fat in the hamberger, the more oatmeal, it absorbs the fat.  Don't  forget to mix in the egg  to bind it all.|`|geih5vR8aa	you can use it. Add a little bit, and if the mixture is still too moist, then add a little more. It will absorb moisture more than bread crumbs, so be careful on how much you use.
zawmsUO1aa	Champagne is a sparkling wine produced exclusively within the Champagne region of France. <br>  <br>  By law, if it's produced elsewhere, it can only be called sparkling wine. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_(wine)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_(...</a>|`|CGnL2nS0aa	To a degree, but there are some differences. One being the grape. Not sure about the details though.|`|aOjQ0uCPaa	champagne IS a wine. But the difference between still wine and sparkling wine is this:<br>  <br>  Still wine grapes are picked later so there is more sugar in the fruit then they are fermented but not until the sugar is completely gone so there is some sweeness left and at that point the fermentation is halted. After that point most winemakers age the wine  for a period of time.<br>  <br>  Sparkling wine is picked earlier so there is less sugar. The juice is fermented fully so it is totally dry...then yeast is added and a bit more sugar for a SECOND fermentation that will make the bubbles. That solution is bottled with a bottle cap and left for a period of time...a year is common. Then the bottle is riddled to get the yeast to the top and disgorged and a bit of syrup is added to make it sweet again.|`|q8N1KZgoaa	no...not really...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=1G1GGLQ_ENUS241&=&q=champagne+vs+wine&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&h...</a><br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Some wines are carbonated, Reunite Lambrusco is an example of one.|`|BGw4DGd1aa	Champagne comes from the champagne region of france, all others are called sparkling wines. At any rate,they are aged less, have a higher sugar number, use different grapes and are carbonated.|`|GzpkA8HFaa	No...champagne is bubbly....wine is not.

heat the oven to 200 degrees F. <br>  Line a large plate with a double layer of paper towels. <br>  Heat 1 inch of oil in a deep 11- to 12-inch diameter cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven, over medium-high heat, to 375 degrees F (oil should pop loudly when a drop of egg mixture is dropped in).<br>  <br>  Combine flour and meat seasoning in a large shallow dish.<br>   In a second large shallow dish, beat the eggs, baking powder, and baking soda; stir in the buttermilk (the mixture will bubble and foam).<br>  <br>  Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and lightly sprinkle each side with meat seasoning to taste.<br>   Working with three steaks at a time, dip each steak into the egg mixture then dredge in the flour mixture. <br>  Shake off any excess flour, and dip again in the egg mixture.<br>   Using a long-handled meat fork or long metal tongs, very gently place the wet steaks into the hot oil<br>  <br>   (be extremely careful...there will be regular "explosions" of very hot oil as steaks cook).<br>  <br>   Fry for 3 to 5 minutes or until breading is set and deep golden brown. <br>  <br>  Gently turn steaks and fry for another 3 minutes (oil temperature will drop to around 335 degrees). <br>  Transfer the steaks to the paper-towel-lined plate to drain, then transfer them to the wire rack in the oven.<br>  <br>   Bring the oil back to 375 degrees and repeat the breading, cooking and draining process (use fresh paper towels) with the three remaining steaks.<br>  <br>  For the Pan Drippings Cream Gravy:<br>   After the chicken fried steaks are removed from the pan, pour off the oil through a strainer.<br>   Leave about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of pan drippings in the bottom of the skillet along with as many of the browned bits and cracklings (from the seasoned coating) as possible.<br>   Return any browned cracklings from the strainer to the skillet before starting the gravy.<br>  <br>  Heat the oil over medium heat until hot. <br>  Sprinkle with enough leftover seasoned flour to absorb most of the oil, approximately 1/4 cup.<br>   Blend with a wooden spoon or whisk, scraping loose browned bits from the bottom and sides of skillet, until mixture becomes bubbly, smooth and golden brown. <br>  Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring constantly and mashing out any lumps, until the gravy begins to boil. <br>  Lower heat and whisk mixture continuously until it is smooth and reaches desired consistency<br>  <br>   (gravy should have a loose consistency--it will thicken as it cools). <br>  <br>  Check seasoning, add salt and pepper to taste. <br>  <br>  Add the Worcestershire and Tabasco sauces, whisking until smooth.<br>  <br>  Transfer the chicken-fried steaks to individual plates.<br>  <br>   Spoon a generous amount of gravy over each steak. <br>  <br>  Serve immediately, placing any remaining gravy in a small bowl. <br>  <br>  Accompany with mashed potatoes, greens, black-eye peas, and cornbread, or biscuits.|`|3rzaWFQFaa	a grill is a fantastic place|`|xLtR8cyMaa	good  old George Foreman grill, salt and pepper and grill|`|AA11490722	do your own a George Foreman grill?

Vm7vpqsmaa	FEEDING TODDLERS: 17 TIPS FOR PLEASING THE PICKY EATER<br>   <br>  When our first few children were toddlers, we dreaded dinnertime. We would prepare all kinds of sensible meals composed of what we thought were healthy, appealing foods. Most of these offerings would end up splattering the high-chair tray and carpeting the floor. To make matters worse, we took our kids' rejection of our cuisine personally, sure that this was a sign of parental lapse on our part. What was wrong? Why were these kids such picky eaters? <br>  <br>  Why toddlers are picky. Being a picky eater is part of what it means to be a toddler. We have since learned that there are developmental reasons why kids between one and three years of age peck and poke at their food. After a year of rapid growth (the average one-year-old has tripled her birth weight), toddlers gain weight more slowly. So, of course, they need less food. The fact that these little ones are always on the go also affects their eating patterns. They don't sit still for anything, even food. Snacking their way through the day is more compatible with these busy explorers' lifestyle than sitting down to a full-fledged feast. <br>  <br>  Learning this helped us relax. We now realize that our job is simply to buy the right food, prepare it nutritiously (steamed rather than boiled, baked rather than fried), and serve it creatively. We leave the rest up to the kids. How much they eat, when they eat, and if they eat is mostly their responsibility; we've learned to take neither the credit nor the blame. <br>  <br>  Toddlers like to binge on one food at a time. They may eat only fruits one day, and vegetables the next. Since erratic eating habits are as normal as toddler mood swings, expect your child to eat well one day and eat practically nothing the next. Toddlers from one to three years need between 1,000 and 1,300 calories a day, yet they may not eat this amount every day. Aim for a nutritionally-balanced week, not a balanced day. <br>  <br>  All this is not to say that parents shouldn't encourage their toddlers to eat well and develop healthy food habits. Based on our hands-on experience with eight children, we've developed 17 tactics to tempt little taste buds and minimize mealtime hassles. <br>  <br>  1. Offer a nibble tray. Toddlers like to graze their way through a variety of foods, so why not offer them a customized smorgasbord? The first tip from the Sears' kitchen is to offer toddlers a nibble tray. Use an ice-cube tray, a muffin tin, or a compartmentalized dish, and put bite-size portions of colorful and nutritious foods in each section. Call these finger foods playful names that a two-year-old can appreciate, such as: <br>  <br>  apple moons (thinly sliced)<br>  avocado boats (a quarter of an avocado)<br>  banana wheels<br>  broccoli trees (steamed broccoli florets)<br>  carrot swords (cooked and thinly sliced)<br>  cheese building blocks<br>  egg canoes (hard- boiled egg wedges)<br>  little O's (o-shaped cereal)<br>  Place the food on an easy-to-reach table. As your toddler makes his rounds through the house, he can stop, sit down, nibble a bit, and, when he's done, continue on his way. These foods have a table-life of an hour or two. <br>  <br>  NUTRITIP: Good Grazing – Good Behavior <br>  <br>  A child's demeanor often parallels her eating patterns. Parents often notice that a toddler's behavior deteriorates toward the end of the morning or mid-afternoon. Notice the connection? Behavior is at its worst the longer they go without food. Grazing minimizes blood-sugar swings and lessens the resulting undesirable behavior. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  2. Dip it. Young children think that immersing foods in a tasty dip is pure fun (and delightfully messy). Some possibilities to dip into: <br>  <br>  cottage cheese or tofu dip<br>  cream cheese<br>  fruit juice-sweetened preserves<br>  guacamole<br>  peanut butter, thinly spread<br>  pureed fruits or vegetables<br>  yogurt, plain or sweetened with juice concentrate <br>  Those dips serve equally well as spreads on apple or pear slices, bell-pepper strips, rice cakes, bagels, toast, or other nutritious platforms. <br>  <br>  3. Spread it. Toddlers like spreading, or more accurately, smearing. Show them how to use a table knife to spread cheese, peanut butter, and fruit concentrate onto crackers, toast, or rice cakes. <br>  <br>  4. Top it. Toddlers are into toppings. Putting nutritious, familiar favorites on top of new and less-desirable foods is a way to broaden the finicky toddler's menu. Favorite toppings are yogurt, cream cheese, melted cheese, guacamole, tomato sauce, applesauce, and peanut butter. <br>  <br>  5. Drink it. If your youngster would rather drink than eat, don't despair. Make a smoothie – together. Milk and fruit – along with supplements such as juice, egg powder, wheat germ, yogurt, honey, and peanut butter – can be the basis of very healthy meals. So what if they are consumed through a straw? One note of caution: Avoid any drinks with raw eggs or you'll risk salmonella poisoning. <br>  <br>  6. Cut it up. How much a child will eat often depends on how you cut it. Cut sandwiches, pan|`|2qbLrHBKaa	I can't believe your parents are letting you stay at his apartment. You are getting weird looks because that relationship is not only wrong, it's illegal.

AA10024510	For softer crust:<br>  <br>  Try the sweet bread setting (if it has one) which will bake either shorter or at a lower temp.<br>  <br>  If the Pause button will shorten the bake cycle, then stop the cycle 5 to 10 minutes early.  If not, use the Stop button to stop the cycle early, and take the bread pan out.<br>  <br>  Since you have problems getting the bread out of the pan, leave the bread in the pan for about 5 minutes after taking it out of the machine.  The pan will cool and create steam around the crust.  After about 5 minutes the loaf should come out quite easily.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Call the manufacture.

Wrap the hot loaf of bread in a tea towel (they are usally made of muslin and are lint free) then put in an airtight tupperware container to cool.  The moisture from the hot bread will soften the crust in the enclosed container.  Once the bread is cooled, put in a dry airtight container.   I do this all the time as we like soft crust on our wheat bread.<br>  <br>  Not sure about how to keep the bread from sticking so bad.  Can you grab the edges of the pan with pot holders, turn the pan upside down, and tap one edge of the pan to make the bread fall out?  Good luck!

If there are really snazzy drinks, then they will be super popular and the alcohol used to make them will run out fast. So I suggest that you have a signature drink like a Cosmo, Martini, or something of that nature that matches your wedding; along with something simple like beer, wine, vodka, etc. <br>  <br>  Or another route you could take would be having "mocktails" or virgin/nonalcoholic cocktails.

Originating from <br>  Andalucia in the south, many people usually assume that it is <br>  made only with seafood. It can and usually is made with meat and seafood. It takes its name from the wide, round metal pan in which it is usually cooked - <br>  traditionally over an outdoor wood fire. <br>  <br>  This pan is shallow, with two handles and comes in a wide variety of sizes from individual to absolutely enormous ones designed for ''fiestas''. <br>  <br>  The strong flavour of the rice is achieved by it absorbing the juices <br>  of the other ingredients during cooking. The distinctive yellow tone of <br>  paella comes from the addition of saffron. <br>  <br>  Please note that this is a simplified recipe using readily available <br>  ingredients. You can add other types of shellfish, squid, octopus, etc, <br>  depending upon availabilty and taste. If your tastes don't run to <br>  seafood, then try replacing the ''fishy'' items with chicken, rabbit or pork.<br>  <br>  Ingredients for 4 people<br>  <br>  Good quality olive oil <br>  1 large onion, finely chopped <br>  3 cloves garlic, chopped <br>  100g garden peas, frozen or tinned<br>  1 small red pepper, chopped<br>  2 large tomatoes, chopped <br>  250g mussels <br>  150g peeled prawns <br>  250g cooked, unpeeled prawns <br>  600ml seafood stock (or chicken stock)<br>  300g short-grain white rice <br>  Half teaspoon saffron threads (or paprika)<br>  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste <br>  <br>  Method<br>  <br>  1. Soak the unpeeled prawns and mussels in cold water for a few hours <br>  (or overnight) before preparing your paella.<br>  <br>  2. Heat some olive oil in the paella pan or a large, deep-sided frying <br>  pan and fry the onion, garlic and red pepper until soft. <br>  <br>  3. Add the tomato, reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. <br>  <br>  4. Mix in the stock, rice and saffron (or paprika), season to taste and <br>  leave to cook for 10 minutes. <br>  <br>  5. Meanwhile, heat some water in a saucepan and boil the mussels until <br>  the shells open. If any shells don't open, please discard them. <br>  <br>  6. Drain the mussels and keep to one side.<br>  <br>  7. Add the peeled prawns and the peas to the frying pan and cook for a <br>  further 5 minutes.<br>  <br>  8. Stir in the cooked mussels and the unpeeled prawns and simmer for <br>  about 5 minutes more, until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid.<br>  <br>  9. Traditionally, the paella is served straight from the pan (a <br>  heat-proof mat is placed on the table first!). However, if you are using a <br>  normal frying pan, then carefully transfer the mixture to a large seving <br>  plate. Garnish with some lemon wedges.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	Spanish Rice.<br>  1 1/2 cups rice<br>  2 1/2 cups chicken broth<br>  1 cup plain tomato sauce*<br>  3 cloves finely chopped garlic *<br>  1/4 of a medium onion*<br>  2 tablespoons oil<br>  4 heaping tablespoons of finely chopped parsley (optional)<br>  In a medium sauce pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add in the fresh garlic and onion. Saute for 1-2 minutes until softened. Add in dry rice. Stir for about 5 minutes until rice becomes a golden brown color. <br>  Add in broth and tomato sauce (Slowly into rice, not directly onto hot pan!) Add in the parsley if you're using it. Stir it up and bring to a boil. Once it starts boiling, turn the heat to low and cover. Let it simmer for 20 minutes and fluff with a fork. <br>  <br>  *If you don't have fresh garlic or onions on hand you can use the equivalent in powder form. Do not saute the powder, just skip that step and add the garlic powder and/or onion powder when you add the liquids. If you don't have tomato sauce you can use unseasoned stewed tomatoes, or canned diced tomatoes with their liquid.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Depends on how you want it.

akA3oJx6aa	Toast: no more than 120 calories, with butter<br>  Ham sandwich: 200 if ham and bread is all there was<br>  Banana: 200 calories<br>  Small jacket potato: with butter, it's about 220-250<br>  Some tuna: let's say three ounces, about 170 calories<br>  <br>  total that is around 900 calories. A girl your age should metabolize it well. I'm around your age and I eat WAY more than that.<br>  <br>  Two hours of exercise, let's say moderate strain, is about 700 calories burnt. You need way more than that, that is NOT a lot of food. Your body needs one calorie to raise your body temperature 1 degree, and throughout the day, that's a lot. Your body also has other functions to complete, and believe it or not, sleeping for 8 hours burns around 90 calories.<br>  <br>  Eat a variety of more vegetables and fruits if you really want to stay healthy.<br>  <br>  Healthy day's worth of food:<br>  <br>  Breakfast: about 300 calories should be consumed, toast (with a little butter and jam), scrambled eggs, and juice is a good start.<br>  <br>  Lunch: about 450 calories, like a turkey sandwich with lettuce, tomato and cheese (to balance things out), a small banana, an ounce of potato chips, and a sweet treat like pudding.<br>  <br>  Small snack: Small apple and yogurt are just fine. Less than 250 calories.<br>  <br>  Dinner: the meal you can gorge on, 600 calories and maybe some more. Spaghetti with meat sauce, small roll, vegetables like peas, carrots, and spinach, and for dessert, it could be possibly be a small slice of cake if you'd like.<br>  <br>  This all, estimated calories, adds up to 1600 calories. That is just about enough, more if you do a lot of sports. I am not the best at approximating calorie content in food, but I know that you certainly didn't eat too much. Too little, if I must say the least.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't worry about these kind of things. It's just fine to have extra calories at the end of the day.

Try to eat veggies and fruits and limit yourself to only two pieces of bread a day rather than 4. If you are going to exercise that much you need to keep your body fueled so load up on fruits and veggies and rather than white bread, look to the whole grain breads, they are heavier but much better for you and fill you up better too.|`|eaVY2Wuhaa	Alex, you are sick person.

(By the way, the oil from meat/fish is very important for the brain and for bones.) <br>  What makes people unhealthy is unnatural food such as chips, fried food, preservatives, too many carbs and so on.<br>  It's very simple, what's natural is healthy, what's unnatural is not.|`|rSJHzlzsaa	Anyone who answers this question with one word is simple minded.

Occasionally it is ok to eat the fat.  Marbling is a desirable quality in a steak and refers to the white strips of fat throughout the red meat portion of the steak.  It is the fat that gives meat its flavor.  While purists (meaning those who don't eat meat or are vegetarian) chastise those of us who know the delicacy of a perfectly prepared steak, know that eating the fat portion is not harmful if it is not done all the time.  Again, Moderation.|`|M1oorJ62aa	yes its fat.

You are correct: using sugar does nothing to preserve them. Use them whole unless you want to make jam or preserves. You can also pop them into the freezer in a sealed container and then take out a few to defrost for your cereal, etc. I usually go through them too quickly to freeze them, though.

NNiN0tK0aa	If you blend raw tomatoes with olive oil with a powerful blender so the cells are completely broken down, then you absorb as much lycopene as from cooked.  Fruit and Veg are healthier raw, but vegetables other than leafy greens and vegetable-fruits are better fermented/cultured as in sauerkraut, kimchee, cultured-with-kefir (a culture thats used to ferment milk).<br>  <br>  Potatoes, grains and most legumes (beans, lentils) are healthier cooked as they contain anti-nutrients/toxins/enzyme-inhibitors which are deactivated by cooking.  Lentils, chickpeas and mung and aduki beans can be sprouted and eaten raw.  The other beans must all be cooked including soya.<br>  <br>  Nuts and seeds are better raw as heating fats and proteins is particularly harmful.  Likewise dairy and eggs are much healthier raw.  Raw dairy and raw eggs don't harm you, cooked do.

I think what you're looking for is a biscuit cutter to cut circles?|`|4Pk6VNftaa	If you're just making nigiri - which is the sushi that has the little pads of rice with fish or other toppings on top, those are just formed by hand.  Take a small amount of rice in one hand, and shape it with your other hand.  It's sort of like making a hamburger patty, but obviously much smaller.  Don't press hard.  You don't want a dense clump of rice.  It should just be sturdy enough to stay together just long enough for you to pick it up, dip it in soy sauce, then pop into your mouth.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to make some sort of silly tower presentation like French chefs seem to love to do, you can just use a biscuit cutter, or even an empty soup can that has the top and bottom lids cut off.  You may want to lightly grease the inside of the can so that the food doesn't stick.  If you save one of the lids, you can place it inside the can, with something heavy on top (like a smaller can) so that your food is pressed down a bit, making for a nicer presentation.|`|ezzSeBnLaa	Do you mean nigiri?

m13Se2dAaa	Start with a Riesling. Pretty much any Riesling you get at a grocery store or liquor store will be fine. Eventually, you'll want to go to wine stores for your wine, but considering you have no background, it isn't worth the money or effort at this time.<br>  <br>  Rieslings are white wines that are typically a little sweet (though when you get to the wine store level, you'll discover dry Rieslings as well) which a first time wine drinker will probably enjoy. They are also among the lowest alcohol wines you can find. Considering you've never had alcohol, I think you'd be much better off starting with a low alcohol wine (as a note - Rieslings can be under 10% alcohol while some big Zinfandel or Shiraz could be over 16% - that's a BIG difference).|`|sDwN4XuIaa	A good starter wine is a white merlot especialy if you are a female, it isnt as sharp as a red wine.

jHcblhmVaa	Yes you can but if you put some water with it in the oven with something to keep the tamales out of the water they will be better.

They need to be steamed.<br>  You don't have a steamer?   Make one.  Wad up a bunch of foil in the bottom of a large pot.  Add an inch or so of water. Place tamales on top of foil, keeping some space between them so they can steam.  Cover and simmer for about 45-60 minutes.<br>  Your masa is raw and it will not cook with sauce on it in the oven.

F2ugW4cRaa	Classic white sauce recipe<br>  1/2 onion <br>  1 bay leaf <br>  8 whole black peppercorns <br>  A few parsley stalks <br>  600ml milk <br>  50g butter (or margarine) <br>  50g plain flour <br>  1. Put onion, bay leaf, peppercorns and parsley stalks into a heavy-based saucepan. Pour in milk and bring just to the boil, then remove from the heat and set aside to infuse for 30 minutes. Strain into a jug.<br>  2. Meanwhile, put butter (or margarine) into a separate, clean, heavy-based saucepan. Let it melt over a medium heat, then add flour. Using a wooden spoon, stir continuously and very well until you have a smooth, slightly grainy paste. This is called a roux.<br>  3. Off the heat, whisk a little of the infused milk into the roux, beating well with the wooden spoon, then return to the heat, beating, until thickened. Repeat until half the milk is incorporated, then switch to a whisk. Continue adding the milk (off the heat) and whisking over the heat until smooth.<br>  4. Reduce the heat to low and continue cooking the sauce for 4-5 minutes, until thickened, stirring occasionally. Taste, season, and make sure there is no hint of flour.<br>  <br>  Tip<br>  If you do take your eye off the ball and this sauce goes lumpy, pass through a sieve and whisk well. All will be fine.<br>  <br>  I would add a handful of fresh chopped parsley.<br>  <br>  Add a layer of green peas over the tuna, add some sauce of the sauce, or all depending on how runny it is. Break in a few eggs and top with mash.<br>  <br>  I have just checked the size of my pans and can tell you a 13"x 9" pan is far too big, your tuna will not even cover the bottom.<br>  I would use an 8"x 6" x 2" pie dish.<br>  <br>  You are making what is close to a fish pie, and if you want more ideas look up those.|`|p8UAIAisaa	Depending on how much tuna you plan to use, say 1 large can - mix tuna with 4 ounces of softened cream cheese - add if you like chopped onions..<br>  mix until it resembles tuna salad - top with mashed potatos and I would sprinkle cheddar cheese over the top and bake.|`|SDqDmkUHaa	Instead of noodles, use vegetables.  A great combination is one 1lb bag of cut broccoli and a 1lb bag of "5-way" mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, lima beans, corn, and cut green beans).

alIO8ic0aa	It all started with a decision.<br>  Our company originated with candy-manufacturer Milton Hershey’s decision in 1894 to produce sweet chocolate as a coating for his caramels. Located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, he called his new enterprise the Hershey Chocolate Company. In 1900, the company began producing milk chocolate in bars, wafers and other shapes. With mass-production, Hershey was able to lower the per-unit cost and make milk chocolate, once a luxury item for the wealthy, affordable to all. One early advertising slogan described this new product as “a palatable confection and a most nourishing food.”<br>  <br>  A company on the move.<br>  The immediate success of Hershey’s low-cost, high-quality milk chocolate soon caused the company’s owner to consider increasing his production facilities. He decided to build a new chocolate factory amid the gently rolling farmland of south-central Pennsylvania in Derry Township, where he had been born. Close to the ports of New York and Philadelphia which supplied the imported sugar and cocoa beans needed, surrounded by dairy farms that provided the milk required, and with a local labor supply of honest, hard-working people, the location was perfect. By the summer of 1905, the new factory was turning out delicious milk chocolate.<br>  <br>  A KISS for the whole world.<br>  Looking to expand its product line, the company in 1907 began producing a flat-bottomed, conical milk chocolate candy which Mr. Hershey decided to name HERSHEY’S KISSES Chocolates. At first, they were individually wrapped in little squares of silver foil, but in 1921 machine wrapping was introduced. That technology was also used to add the familiar “plume” at the top to signify to consumers that this was a genuine HERSHEY’S KISS Chocolate. In 1924, the company even had it trademarked.<br>  <br>  New products, hard times.<br>  Throughout the next two decades, even more products were added to the company’s offerings. These included MR. GOODBAR (1925), HERSHEY’S Syrup (1926), chocolate chips (1928) and the KRACKEL bar (1938). Despite the Great Depression of the 1930s, these products helped the newly incorporated Hershey Chocolate Corporation maintain its profitability and avoid any worker layoffs. Nevertheless, supported by the CIO labor union, a group of workers staged a six-day strike that ended with the strikers being forcibly removed by loyal workers and local farmers.<br>  <br>  HERSHEY’S chocolate goes to war.<br>  With the outbreak of World War II, the Hershey Chocolate Corp. (which had provided milk chocolate bars to American doughboys in the first war) was already geared up to start producing a survival ration bar for military use. By the end of the war, more than a billion of these Ration D bars had been produced and the company had earned no less than five Army-Navy “E” Production Awards for its exceptional contributions to the war effort. In fact, the company’s machine shop even turned out parts for the Navy’s antiaircraft guns.<br>  <br>  A family friend becomes a family member.<br>  The post-war period saw the introduction of a host of new products and the acquisition of an old one. Since 1928, H.B. “Harry” Reese’s candy company, also located in Hershey, had been making chocolate-covered peanut butter cups. Given that Hershey Chocolate supplied the coating for REESE’S “penny cups”; (the wrapper said, “Made in Chocolate Town, So They Must Be Good”), it was not surprising that the two companies had a good relationship. As a result, seven years after Reese’s death in 1956, the H.B. Reese Candy Company was sold to Hershey Chocolate Corp.<br>  <br>  Growing up and branching out.<br>  The following decades would see the company - renamed Hershey Foods Corporation in 1968 - expanding its confectionery product lines, acquiring related companies and even diversifying into other food products. Among the many acquisitions were: San Giorgio Macaroni and Delmonico Foods (1966); manufacturing and marketing rights to English candy company Rowntree MacKintosh’s products (1970); Y&S Candies, makers of Twizzlers licorice (1977); Dietrich Corp.’s confectionery operations (1986); Peter Paul/Cadbury’s U.S. confectionery operations (1988); and Ronzoni Foods (1990).<br>  <br>  The Hershey Company enters a new century.<br>  Today, The Hershey Company is the leading North American manufacturer of chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and grocery products. As the new millennium begins, we continue to introduce new products f

7QRq8b4baa	Most cake decorators cover the cake with icing, smooth it out and let it chill in the fridge for a bit (to harden) and then they put fondant over that...then you get the creamy icing texture and the pretty finish of the fondant. Also, put icing or fruit filling in the middle to make it more moist. Lastly, to doctor up a boxed cake, you can add pudding or cream cheese which makes it even more delicious and moist.|`|Rl2Jcpqlaa	Go ahead and use the Betty Crocker mix- to assure a moist cake, you can alwys soak the layers with a bit of simple syrup- <br>  The cake needs a layer of buttercream, and not just a very thin one, obviously you want fondant, but do you really just want to eat a piece of cake with a strip of fondant? I know I don't, fondant is not that delicious and the majority of people peel it off. <br>  Give the cake a thin coat of frosting, chill it, then contine with a normal, or slightly less) amount of frosting, chill to firm, and then cover with a thin layer of fondant. <br>  <br>  One more thing- if you are making your own fondant, its gonna be awhile before you can use it, so unless its already made, I would say you have enough time to make a delicious cake from scratch.|`|rvoo4rBjaa	Any cake is fine and the fondant should  seal it and keep it fresh. I find it easier if you freeze the cake first before working on it.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	professional bakers make the cake and then use butter cream frosting and give the cake a thin layer of frosting and then use fondant. It doesn't matter what kind of cake you make. I recently made a banana cake with cream cheese frosting and fondant it was good! Fondant is easy to mold just keep putting it in the fridge.

I love chocolate and cheesecake, so this was right up my alley.  So I looked it up online and have it bookmarked on my computer.   I haven't had a chance to make it since we are really watching our weight around here, so I don't do as much baking as I used to.  I thought I would pass this on to you.  If you choose it, please let me know how it turns out.<br>  <br>  Triple Chocolate Cheesecake<br>  From Woman's Day | April 1, 2007<br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS<br>  <br>            o Crust<br>            o 1/2 stick (4 Tbsp) butter, softened<br>            o 11/2 cups chocolate cookie crumbs (about 27 Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers or 20 Oreo cookies, finely crushed)<br>            o Filling<br>            o 3 bricks (8 oz each) 1/3-less-fat cream cheese (Neufchatel), softened<br>            o 1 cup sugar<br>            o 2 Tbsp cornstarch<br>            o 3 large eggs<br>            o 1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream<br>            o 1 Tbsp vanilla extract<br>            o 4 oz milk chocolate<br>            o 4 oz white chocolate<br>            o 4 oz semisweet chocolate<br>            o Chocolate Glaze<br>            o 3 oz bittersweet baking chocolate<br>            o 2 Tbsp stick butter<br>            o 1 Tbsp light corn syrup<br>  <br>  PREPARATION<br>  <br>        1. Place a sheet of foil on oven rack to catch any drips. Heat oven to 350°F. You’ll need an 8 x 3-in. springform pan coated with nonstick spray.<br>  <br>        2. Crust: In small bowl, rub butter into crumbs until crumbs are evenly moistened. Press firmly over bottom of pan. Bake 8 to 10 minutes on foil sheet until set. Cool on rack. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F.<br>  <br>        3. Filling: Beat cream cheese, sugar and cornstarch in a large bowl with mixer on medium speed until smooth, scraping down sides of the bowl several times with a silicone or rubber spatula. With mixer on low speed beat in eggs, 1 at a time, then sour cream and vanilla just until blended.<br>  <br>        4. Divide the batter evenly (about 2 cups each) among 3 medium bowls. Melt the chocolates separately. Stir milk chocolate into 1 bowl of batter, white chocolate into another and semisweet chocolate into third. Spread milk chocolate batter in prepared crust in an even layer. Carefully spoon white chocolate batter over milk chocolate layer to cover; gently smooth with an offset spatula (do not let batters run together). Spoon semisweet chocolate batter over white chocolate layer to cover; smooth with an offset spatula (do not let batters run together).<br>  <br>        5. Bake 11/4 hours or until set and center still jiggles slightly when shaken (cake should have pulled away from sides of pan; if not, carefully run a thin knife around edge of pan to release cheesecake). Cool in pan on a wire rack. Cover; refrigerate at least 4 hours or up to 2 days.<br>  <br>        6. Chocolate Glaze: Combine glaze ingredients in a small saucepan; whisk over low heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat; let cool 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br>  <br>        7. Remove pan sides; place cheesecake on serving plate. Spread glaze over top of cheesecake, just to the edge (some glaze may drip down side of cake). Refrigerate just until glaze is set or, if chilled longer, let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving.    <br>  <br>        Planning Tip: Make cake through Step 5 one to two days before serving.|`|SmdxxTPuaa	Hi Natalie,<br>  <br>  This chocolate cheesecake tastes even better if you let it sit in the refrigerator overnight, and serve it the next day.<br>  <br>  For the crust:<br>  3 cups chocolate wafer crumbs (do in food processor)<br>  1/3 cup (2/3 of a stick) margarine melted<br>  <br>  For the filling: <br>  3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese at room temperature<br>  1 cup sugar<br>  4 eggs (at room temperature)<br>  2 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted<br>  2 ounces sweet chocolate, melted<br>  <br>  To make the crust:<br>  <br>  Mix wafer crumbs and melted margarine with your hands until mixture holds together when pressed hard.<br>  Press firmly into the bottom and halfway up the sides of a 12-inch spring form pan. <br>  Place crust in freezer until ready to fill.<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 350 F.<br>  <br>  To make the filling:<br>  <br>  Cream cheese at a low speed with a mixer for 2 minutes until free of lumps, scraping down sides of the bowl.<br>  Continue beating and add sugar in a steady stream.<br>  Cream at low speed for another minute, then beat on high for 30 seconds.<br>  Turn beater back to low and add the eggs, one at a time; beat until the shine leaves the batter before adding the next egg.

Process again until it makes damp, clumping crumbs and then tip them into the pan. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan to make an even base and put into the freezer while you make the filling.<br>  <br>  Put a kettle on to boil.<br>  <br>  Melt the chocolate either in a microwave or double boiler, and set aside to cool slightly.<br>  <br>  Beat the cream cheese to soften it, then add the sugar and custard power, beating again to combine. Beat in the whole eggs and then the yolks, and the sour cream. Finally add the cocoa dissolved in hot water and melted chocolate and mix to a smooth batter.<br>  <br>  Take the springform tin out of the freezer and line the outside of the tin with a good layer of cling wrap, and then another layer of strong foil over that. This will protect it from the water bath.<br>  <br>  Sit the springform tin in a roasting pan and pour in the cheesecake filling. Fill the roasting pan with just boiled water to come about half way up the cake tin and bake in the oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour. The top of the cheesecake should be set, but the underneath should still have a wobble to it.<br>  <br>  Peel away the foil and cling film wrapping and sit the cheesecake in its tin on a rack to cool. Put in the refrigerator once it is no longer hot, and leave to set, covered with plastic overnight. Let it lose its chill before unspringing the cheesecake to serve.<br>  <br>  To make the chocolate sauce: very gently melt the chopped chocolate, cream and syrup. When the chocolate has nearly melted, take off the heat and whisk it to a smooth sauce. Let it cool a little, and pour it over the chocolate cheesecake on its serving plate.|`|1dvYP7nfaa	I precisely don't know about that but you may like these:<br>  <br>  Coffee Cake Recipes<br>  <a href="http://www.articleswave.com/recipes/easy-coffee-cake-recipes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.articleswave.com/recipes/easy...</a><br>  <br>  Ice Cream Cake Recipes<br>  <a href="http://www.articleswave.com/recipes/ice-cream-cake-recipes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.articleswave.com/recipes/ice-...</a><br>  <br>  Chocolate Banana Cake Recipes<br>  www.articleswave.com/recipes/chocolate...

RKLFYS2Naa	MY FAVORITE RECIPE OF ALL TIME IS WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED!!! PLEASE TAKE NOTE......<br>  <br>  These chicken enchiladas are done in the southern Mexican style (though "suizas" is actually Spanish for "Swiss-style"!). The recipe is similar to enchiladas with salsa verde, but the sauce is enriched with cream, and cheese is added on top. This serves 4 to 6.<br>  <br>  <br>  Step1Drain the tomatillos. Puree the tomatillos, jalape?o, garlic, onion and cilantro in a food processor. <br>  Step2Heat 1 tbsp. oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add a drop or two of the puree. <br>  Step3If the puree sizzles when it hits the oil, add the rest of the puree to the pan. Let the puree cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 or 4 minutes or until it gets slightly darker. <br>  Step4Add the broth and cream and simmer until it takes on the consistency of gravy (about 8 minutes). Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper. <br>  Step5Keep sauce warm while assembling the enchiladas. <br>  Assembling the Enchiladas<br>  Step1Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. <br>  Step2In a bowl, combine the shredded chicken, sour cream, garlic salt, minced green onion and oregano. <br>  Step3Heat the remaining oil in a small sauté pan. Using tongs, dip a tortilla in the oil for a second or two, just long enough to soften it. <br>  Step4Take a large plate and put several tablespoons of the sauce on it. Put the tortilla on top of the sauce, then flip it over. <br>  Step5Place 2 or 3 tablespoons of the chicken mixture in a line across the middle of the tortilla. Using your fingers, bring the two edges opposite the chicken over each other to form a snug roll around the chicken. <br>  Step6Put the tortilla, flap down, in a glass baking dish. The dish should hold all rolls snugly in a single layer. <br>  Step7Repeat the process with the remaining tortillas and chicken. Pour any remaining sauce over the rolls. Sprinkle the cheese over the top. <br>  Step8Bake uncovered for 8 or 9 minutes, until the cheese is melted and starts to sizzle.|`|Vm7vpqsmaa	GREEN CHICKEN ENCHILADAS   <br>  <br>  4 large skinless boneless chicken breasts<br>  3 cans Cream of Mushroom Soup<br>  1 pk (24) corn tortillas<br>  1 16 oz pk shredded cheese blend (your choice)<br>  2 cans diced skinless green chilies<br>  8-10 oz water<br>  2 tablespoons oil<br>  <br>  Boil chicken breast until fully cooked.

Vm7vpqsmaa	This creamy, easy appetizer is a great start to your romantic dinner. Served with either bread or fruit, you can decide how filling you want it to be. The original recipe stated that this serves four. My hubby likes it so much that it serves two in our house. You're not big pigs like us? Scale it down by half. <br>  Ingredients:<br>  2 tsp. shallots, minced<br>  1 tsp. butter<br>  1 C. heavy cream<br>  1 tsp. white truffle oil<br>  2 tsp. finely chopped fresh chives<br>  4 oz. camembert, room temperature<br>  salt and pepper, to taste<br>  <br>  <br>  Instructions: In saucepan, cook shallots in butter over med-high heat, until softened. <br>  <br>  Add cream. Simmer, uncovered, until reduced to about 2/3 cup. <br>  <br>  Remove from heat. Stir in truffle oil. <br>  <br>  Add salt and pepper to taste and stir in chives. <br>  <br>  Cut Camembert cheese into two wedges and arrange on plates. <br>  <br>  Pour hot cream sauce over and around cheese. <br>  <br>  Serve with your choice of fresh fruits, nuts, and breads. Serves 2-4. <br>  <br>  Note: Want to use this for a main meal? A rich, romantic meal idea that guys will love is to serve this over a cheeseburger. After all, what says love to a man like beef smothered in cheese? <br>  <br>  <br>  Romantic Main Dish:<br>  Filet Mignon with Mushroom-Wine Sauce of LoveThis steak is a great romantic meal idea, because while it's tender and super flavorful, it's also relatively light. Served with roasted asparagus (recipe below) and mashed or baked potato, this is the perfect recipe for a romantic dinner for two. Without all the fat of lots of butter or cream, it leaves room (and energy) for all kinds of desserts. Wink wink. <br>  <br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  2 tbsp. butter, divided<br>  3 tbsp. shallots, minced<br>  1/4 C. fresh shiitake mushrooms, cleaned and stems removed<br>  3/4 C. dry red wine, divided (cabernet is nice)<br>  5 fl. oz. beef consomme<br>  fresh ground black pepper, to taste<br>  2 (4 ounce) filet mignon steaks<br>  1/2 tbsp. soy sauce<br>  1 tsp. cornstarch<br>  1 tsp. dried thyme<br>  fresh thyme (garnish)<br>  <br>  <br>  Instructions: In a nonstick frying pan, saute shallots and mushrooms in 1 tbsp butter for about 4 mins, til tender. <br>  <br>  Add 1/2 cup of red wine and 3 fl. oz consomme. Simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove the mushrooms from sauce, set aside. <br>  <br>  Boil wine mixture over high heat until reduced to 1/4 cup. <br>  <br>  Combine sauce with mushrooms in bowl. Set aside. In another bowl, combine combine soy sauce with cornstarch. Set aside. <br>  <br>  Sprinkle filets with pepper to taste. Saute steaks in remaining 1 tbsp butter over medium heat, about 3 minutes per side for a 1-inch thick steak. <br>  <br>  Reduce fire to medium-low heat; cook steaks until desired level of doneness. Remove from pan, keep warm. <br>  <br>  Add the rest of the red wine and beef consommé to the skillet, scraping to deglaze pan and incorporate tasty steak bits into the sauce. Bring to a boil. Boil for one minute. Add mushroom/sauce mixture, cornstarch/soy sauce mixture, and the thyme. Boil one minute, stirring constantly, until thickened. <br>  <br>  Place steaks on plate and pour sauce over. Garnish with fresh thyme. Serves 2. <br>  <br>  Romantic Side Dish:<br>  Garlic and Love all the Thyme Roasted AsparagusThis is a great recipe for a Valentine dinner party or romantic dinner-- it's easy, light, and flavorful. You just toss it together and forget about it. The asparagus bakes in the oven (along with a pair of baked potatoes to make a scrumptious but simple romantic meal) while the rest of the dinner comes together. After all, sweating your butt off in the kitchen isn't a very romantic meal idea. <br>  Ingredients:<br>  1 lb. green asparagus, washed, ends snapped off<br>  2 cloves garlic, minced<br>  1 tbsp. butter<br>  1 tbsp. olive oil<br>  1/2 tbsp. chopped fresh thyme<br>  1/2 tsp. fresh ground black pepper<br>  coarse sea salt, to taste<br>  <br>  <br>  Ingredients: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. <br>  <br>  Place asparagus in an oven-safe dish. Sprinkle with garlic and dot with butter. Pour olive over asparagus, sprinkle with thyme and pepper. Add salt to taste. <br>  <br>  Roast uncovered 40 minutes, tossing halfway through cook time. Serves 2. <br>  <br>  Did you know asparagus was an aphrodisiac? Check out some other aprhodisiac ingredients here. We use lots of them in our menu-- after all, tossing in an aphrodisiac or two isn't a bad romantic meal idea. <br>  <br>  Romantic Dessert:<br>  Ignite the Flames of My Desire Bananas FosterI have yet to meet a man that does not love bananas foster. It's rum-rich, creamy, and spicy with cinnamon. Also, the flames are sorta sexy (this works especially well if your man is a pyromaniac), as is the sensual combination of cold and hot, making it a great romantic meal idea if you want a sensual dessert. The recipe was originally intended to feed four, but we can eat this between the two of us, no problem. (Do you see an eating pattern emerging here?) <br>  Ingredients:<br>  1/4 C. butter<br>  1 C. brown sugar<br>  1/2 tsp. cinnamon<br>  4 bananas<br>  1/4 C. dark rum<br>  1/4 C. banana liqueur<br>  vanilla ice cream<br>  <br>  <br>  Instructions: Cut peeled bananas in half lengthwise, then halve each length. Set aside. <br>  <br>  In a large skil|`|2qbLrHBKaa	It definitely depends on what he likes. I make a KILLER cheap, fast, easy, gourmet spaghetti with clam sauce. I made it last night, actually, and it was so good, we had a huge bowl of leftovers that are already gone!<br>  <br>  1 small onion, chopped<br>  1 large clove garlic, chopped<br>  olive oil/ butter (a little of both- just enough to coat onions/ garlic)<br>  1 cup chicken stock<br>  1/4 cup dry white wine (Pinot Grigio is my fave or Chardonnay)<br>  1 can chopped clams IN JUICE (save clam meat for end only!)<br>  2 tsps dried thyme<br>  a pinch of oregano and basil<br>  2 tsp cornstarch<br>  A little less than 1/2 box of spaghetti<br>  Parmesan cheese<br>  <br>  Begin cooking pasta according to directions. In the meantime saute onion and garlic in olive oil/butter until soft. Add clam liquid only, chicken broth, white wine, herbs and cornstarch and simmer 5-10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add clam meat at the end to simmer only for 1-2 minutes. Add pasta into the pan with the sauce (should be very saucy at this point) and simmer for 1 minute more. Add a generous helping of Parmesan cheese and serve. serve with some of the wine used in the sauce and garlic bread, maybe a nice salad before and voila<br>  <br>  This dinner is very romantic and it is so good! and even better as leftovers the next day- if you choose not to make it for him for your first meal you may want to make it another time, it's so cheap, easy, quick, and delicious<br>  <br>  You can even make the sauce ahead of time. Just reheat in pan and add freshly cooked pasta into it.|`|Svgc3izpaa	I just wanted to tell you what I do with my husband.  When we have a special night, like an anniversary, because we have to young children it has to be simple and those are the nights we have dinner after they are in bed.  <br>  <br>  So one thing I like to do is a really great salad.  For my husband it is one with slivered almonds, sunflower seeds, grated cheese, croutons, and olives on Romain lettuce with ranch.  <br>  But maybe for your dinner you could do what I would prefer which is baby greens with crumbled blue cheese, walnuts, and dried cranberries with my favorite vinaigrette from lighthouse Pomegranate blueberry.  - That was served at banquets when I worked catering.  Or there is a great salad of spinach with dried cherries with a balsamic vinegar you might be able to google - I've been trying to drag that recipe from my cousin for months now.<br>  I also serve crab cakes for an appetizer I get them from Winco for a dollar a piece.  The best way I have made them, which was last night, I placed them on a broiling pan and broiled till they looked really crispy then flipped and broiled again till they looked over done really.  Then when they have cooled they were the best I have ever done.  <br>  I am not really suggesting this be all your dinner but as the first two courses it would do nicely.  Both quick and easy leaving you free to do a wonderful main course.  Though we normally do have this with lime juice on the cakes and fresh made bread with Parmesan and parsley, as our dinner.|`|tRNtFNHLaa	depends on what he likes.<br>  something simple, but not to simple.

The trick for rice is to not peek under the lid while it is cooking and do NOT stir it.  For white rice, use 2 parts water for 1 part rice.

JmZQXyyyaa	Evidently my executive chef, too.  I suspect he adds only hot, not boiling water.  The other thing he does that I dont, is that he pours the hot mix into the mold, then adds the cold water, and doesnt really mix it well.  Be sur eto really mix the gelatin powder with boiling water until all bits dissolve, add your cold water and mix well again.  Add to your mold(s). Allow the jello to cool somewhat before refrigeration. Keep your jello covered in the fridge, as the cold air dehydrates everything, which can cause your jello to crust >( Its why bread stales in the fridge too!)|`|MhfneF0xaa	I like the fruit salad recipe above, here's a variation: Instead of fruit salad, use mandarin orange sections (canned) and orange flavored gelatin.<br>  <br>  You can even try using club soda or cream sherry instead of water!|`|AA10927032	Yep, stir it longer, and make sure your refrigerator is not freezing it, mine does that, have to be careful. Be sure you follow the package directions. It really does mean boiling water, and cold water.<br>  My fave recipe is to use fruit cocktail and and raspberry jello, drain the fruit, and pour that into a measure cup, and fill it up to the measure with water. Make the jello with the boiling water, put in the water/juice, and add the fruit cocktail. Marshmallows are optional.|`|0dm59JOLaa	Sounds like you're not heating mixing it enough. This allows the gelatin to stratify into layers of different density.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you cook it as long as the instructions recommend.

xi9amEG2aa	I live in Ellwood City (which is 45 mins north of Pittsburgh)....and I've never heard of that hard cider.  But Woodchuck Hard Cider is pretty good.  They have Green Apple, Pear, Amber, and a couple others.  Pear is my favorite, then next is the apple one.  All it is, is fermented fruit juice, there's no barley or hops or anything in it, like beer does.  I think it's about 5.5% alcohol, and it kinda sneaks up on you cuz it's so yummy.  *drools*  I want some now  haha

AA11015885	Yes a lot of people are and it's actualy a pretty popular way to eat your favorite noodles. According to Nissin food website, it is completely food to eat uncooked ramen noodles. They say that Top Ramen noodles (like all other kind of ramen noodles) are precooked and completely safe to eat<br>  <br>  Here are some way to eat your raw ramen noodles:<br>  -You can eat them right off the package, since there is a lot of sodium in ramen, does tast pretty good.<br>  -You can break your noodles in small pieces and spread them on the top of your meals.<br>  -You can also break them in small pieces, and put them in the cooking pan with some oil. Wait until they get a nice brownish color and it's totaly delicious. Oh right, it's not raw ramen anymore :)<br>  -Some people also like to use the soup base when eating ramen uncooked. Even if we don't recommend eating the soup base (see nutrition facts section), we can confirm that raw ramen + soup base taste is pretty unique and it can be alright to eat that.. once in a while!<br>  <br>  You eat your noodles the way you want.

Play around with different things and you might find some you like... if you don't, there's always that good friend salt|`|zHcDt8t7aa	Yes I add salt to everything|`|AA11402528	nope, i actually never did and still dont..i dont really even eat salty foods..except the occasional tortilla chips. guess i can thank my sweet tooth for that one lol|`|ODvnyAdlaa	no never unless its fish and chips x|`|dd15228a42b4652d8768334912349b61aa	I love cooking and making soups ~ the only time I use salt is when I'm cooking veg ~ no other time.<br>  <br>  If you are making soup ~ say a veg soup, then use a stock cube [it will have enough salt in it] I add a little ground black pepper to bring the taste out.<br>  <br>  Also try using a small amount of something like Caribbean hot pepper sauce [only a bit until you get the taste] and this adds to the flavour.<br>  <br>  There is no doubt that too much salt really does you harm, and you should be aware of that ~ I have a dinner party every week, and at no time do I put "salt and pepper" on the table ~ and sometimes someone will ask for it, but I ask them to try the food first, if they want more then they can have it ~ but they never do.<br>  <br>  There are so many things to add taste, from onions, garlic, also don't forget red and green peppers, they break up in a soup and add a different taste ~ so no you don't need to add it to anything other than cooking first off [and then only a little]<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|T2C6hqaAaa	I find you don't really need it in boiled veg and pasta/rice. I always forget to put it on but realise it tastes no different anyway. Try using sweet veg in particular, with nice taste, like carrots and pepper, and don't overcook/boil them. <br>  <br>  Or if you need some flavour, stock (esp veg stock) and herbs should hopefully do the trick! Or even a bit of vinegar.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	There are spice blends marketed as salt alternatives that you could try, like Mrs. Dash.  If you look in the spice aisle at the grocery store you'll see some, and you can try one and see if you like it.<br>  <br>  I didn't put salt in my food until I stopped eating dairy products, and then I craved it.|`|Gox4ol8Zaa	Salt makes food tase really good..and as long as you dont have TOO much, it not that bad...for alternative flavouring, depends what you like...put spices in it, or garlic, or something..|`|R1h0bHeMaa	i never add salt... however, i love garlic.|`|d5t5XgfVaa	yah without salt your food will tast gross. salt is a very good flavor but not too much of it;]|`|VEgv5NhSaa	yes i love salt :):) x
AA11600789	Michael's carries Wilton "fondant"...it is totally, absolutely gross and taste totally, absolutely NOTHING like fondant should taste. It's loaded with chemicals.   That's why most people won't eat it.  I buy a product called "Satin Ice" at several sites online if I need a ton of it for a wedding cake.    If you are covering a cake, go to www.baking911.com and find their "rolled buttercream" recipe (I think it's under their "Icings" site).  You can also do a search for "MMF Recipe"...marshmallow fondant.  Easy to make, delicious to taste, rolls out and acts like fondant.  (I'd give you the source, but I'm on my lunch hour at work and don't have the info with me.) Good Luck.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Michael's has a very large cake-decorating section and DOES carry it ...

It contains seeds.|`|22621f93a7534ed2f1a71acf45cf11a4aa	fruit|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	they are a fruit|`|lcuxD3qlaa	Cucumbers are not fruit...They are a vegetable<br>  Tomatoes are a fruit though<br>  <br>  <br>  A fruit is the matured ovary of a flower, containing the seed. After fertilization takes place and the embryo (plantlet) has begun to develop, the surrounding ovule becomes the fruit. Yum. I won’t go on about the four types of fruit–simple, aggregate, multiple and accessory–which explain things like berries and pineapples.<br>  <br>  A vegetable is considered to be edible roots, tubers, stems, leaves, fruits, seeds, flower clusters, and other softer plant parts. In common usage, however, there is no exact distinction between a vegetable and a fruit. The usual example is the tomato, which is a fruit, but is eaten as a vegetable, as are cucumbers, peppers, melons, and squashes. The classification of plants as vegetables is largely determined by custom, culture, and usage.|`|4WQ9zKTBaa	The cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely cultivated plant in the gourd family Cucurbitaceae, which includes squash, and in the same genus as the muskmelon.  Having an enclosed seed and developing from a flower, cucumbers are scientifically classified as a fruit. Much like tomatoes and squash, despite the scientific classification their sour-bitter flavor contributes to cucumbers being percieved, prepared and eaten as vegetables|`|0VUFAa6raa	It's technically a fruit. From a botanical perspective, a fruit is the mature ovary of a plant, such as an apple, melon, cucumber, or tomato.  cucumbers tend to be lumped in with vegetables because of the way they are used (cooked and in salads), but botanists will call them fruits because they develop from the reproductive structures of plants.|`|eL268hETaa	Pumpkins have seeds too, but no one considers them a fruit.  They are a vegetable in the squash family.  Seeds have nothing to do with the classification of fruits or vegetables.  Corn IS a seed for heaven's sake!  Cucumbers are most definitely a vegetable.<br>  <br>  And BTW, corn is a GREEN vegetable not yellow!  Go figure.|`|FK27EfOWaa	Vegetable<br>  <br>  I have the same argument with tomatoes, I believe they are vegetables.|`|At6ZJka0aa	It is a vegetable.

FPsR2xi7aa	Molasses can be found in any grocery store.

I'd ask one of their stocking clerks.|`|2NRCJgq2aa	Molasses will be found with the syrups - perhaps in the condiments section or jellies - depends on your store.

I've also seen wheat germ, but not noticed any wheat germ oil.|`|9ro8fiKvaa	The grocery store ... molasses is an old ingredient and so should be available in the baking section and if you can't find wheat germ oil in a regular grocery store, look up health food stores in your area and check it out there.|`|9180cbc0f4cb5886525affd9ed9878a9aa	Wheat germ can be found at any grocery store like Kroger or Randall's or WalMart, just look by the flour or breadcrumbs<br>  <br>  Molasses can be found at the same places, just look by the syrup products.

fwnqB0dTaa	The beer with the H is Hoegaarden, which is made with coriander and bitter oranges (the same oranges that are made into Curacao).<br>  <br>  Widmer, if I remmebr correctly, has a more banana than citrus taste (this is true of quite a few Weizen beers.<br>  <br>  And I really can't do with the American trend to put slices of lemon in Wheat beers.
