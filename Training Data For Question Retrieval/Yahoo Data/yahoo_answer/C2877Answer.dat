UAMtRFruaa	A bit over priced.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	I belive that was the name of the place, As I recall the food was wicked good.|`|mymTKvJraa	yes. and their food is brillant
CBsfqXCIaa	The Compass Room. Its the resturant that rotates. It makes one full circle high over the city atop the Hyatt Regency downtown. <br>  <br>  122 N Second St<br>  The Hyatt Regency<br>  Phoenix, AZ 85004<br>  <br>  I've been there twice and they have Chicken, Steak, Seafood, yummy appetizers, desserts etc. I would def check it out!!|`|cf3b4c9a1788b436ca969afa64100affaa	In Phoenix? I doubt it.|`|otYIidtHaa	Phoenix is a cornucopia of fine dining for any budget.<br>  Houston's, Ruth Chris, Fago Y Brasso (a MUST for meat lovers)<br>  <br>  We also have what has been voted the best pizza in the USA. That's right, pizza in phoenix, voted best by Bon Appetite magazine, Oprah Winfrey, Martha Stewart, and many others. Its called Pizzaria Bianco and it is not to be believed.<br>  <br>  I resent the person who said they doubted there was good food in Phx. That couldn't be farther from the truth. Phx is booming with culture, (AZ Ballet, Phx Symphony, etc)  and great food. Check out www.Yelp.com for honest informative reviews from real folks.
1YiLzar0aa	I worked 'at' a restaurant is the correct one.
7YMTiCD4aa	The restaurant the other two answerers are referring to is called The Blue Bayou.  It is definitely romantic, and the perfect place to take your girlfriend.  Make sure you make advanced dining reservations because it does tend to book up quickly.  Check out AllEars.net for the full menu, just go under the Disneyland section, and go to dining.  Hope you have a great time =)|`|5trG42mlaa	I would say the one in New Orleans Square, right next to Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Or, across from it I guess. It has a French feel to it, so I would guess its the most romantic.|`|653899f3da14fe16dab0886bd25fbc3eaa	the one in the pirates of the carribean. dark, candle lit. not sure if you have to make reservations though. it's nice.|`|RFM7mRWpaa	Try the restaurants in Downtown Disney. They have and ESPN Zone, which is my favorite, Rainforest Cafe, and Ralph Brennan's Jazz Cafe, but those restaurants aren't romantic. They do also have a House of Blues there, which is a concert venue and a restaurant, but you have to buy tickets to go to concerts there. They also have an Italian restautant there, I don't know what it's called, but I guess that's the best one for you, it's the most romantic. If you do decide to eat at one of the restautants in Downtown Disney, after you guys eat, you guys should take a walk around Downtown Disney, and free concerts are played around Downtown Disney during the night time. If you don't like these restaurants in Downtown Disney, the Anaheim Gardenwalk is nearby just outside Disneyland, so you can go there. They offer alot of good choices of casual-fine dining restaurants. They have Bubba Gump Shirmp Co., McCormick and Schmicks Grille, P.F. Changs China Bistro, California Pizza Kitchen, Cheesecake Factory, and Roy's Hawaiian Cusine, are the restaurants they have there. Then after eating, or after, if you decide to go to Downtown Disney, you can head over to the Anaheim Gardenwalk, and you can watch a movie at their IMAX Movie Theatre, and or play bowling at 300 Anahiem which you can also eat there. For more information about Downtown Disney, and the Anaheim Gardenwalk, the websites are below in the sources.

A8F4HF3Paa	I'm not sure the name of the store, but the Del Amo mall has a menswear store that sells hats (not sure if they carry the bowler kind but I know they have fedoras).  Sorry, I know that's not a huge help but there is definitely one there.

TiKlwqDEaa	yeah.....................but sometimes it's nasty! UGH.:(|`|VXcp8hvHaa	it'll make a turd|`|FOAJht6yaa	Only their Mcflurries.    But I detest that "only greasy losers work there."    Yes, a lot of people working there are greasy losers. But you can find those anywhere. I also know several very normal very clean very well-brought up teenagers who weren't above working at McDonalds if it meant making some money so they wouldn't have to live off of their parents constantly.     Little bit judgemental of a statement, in my opinion. Think about it.|`|sqPoFZ00aa	I like their breakfast, but that's about it.|`|9ldwNX7Oaa	No but I only go there for the happy meals. I have a five year old pudgy, little cousin who squeals like a piglet over the little toys. I only give him the toy, not the food because it's unhealthy.|`|YTQGKzuqaa	Yes I do =]|`|vzcSd5l7aa	no, greasy losers work there    To respond to that other person:   Yes, I know this was a judgmental thing to say.  That's why I said it.      They treated me like sh*t there.  From my experience, everyone that worked there who I knew was either  A) A dropout  or  B) A soon-to-be dropout    I could tell I wasn't liked there, maybe it was the fact I had an expensive coat and boots and they disliked me for it, I don't know.      What I do know is they definitely had a biased against me.  I did my job right, I came in on time, I was polite (much nicer than the rest that worked in there, as a matter of fact), and I was fast and accurate.  Then, they fired me.  (Might I mention they called my cell phone at school during class to do this.)    I looked into every possible reason I could've been fired and it just didn't add up, so that's why I believe they have a biased against certain types of people who just don't meet what they're looking for.    Not to mention the place was disgustingly greasy and unclean  , the people were rude, the place was disorganised (my first day there and they lost my paperwork), and the hours were sh*t.  To anyone thinking of applying there, don't.  It is the worst place I've ever worked.  Now I work at a grocery store as a part-time job.    Oh yeah, and I hate mcdonalds, to flat-out answer the asker's question.|`|BNHeJm8Maa	No, I always feel sick after eating there and they have no adequate vegetarian options!! Good coffee though and cheap which is good.|`|JdLhhIjNaa	oh ya i eat it a lot and im not even fat|`|lAn6ih0Qaa	only the fries. but its like a "99 cent heart attack"|`|4mOZFwpgaa	its ok|`|fdDDNucYaa	No, the last time I ate at McDonald's I got a chicken sandwich and french fries. I only took a few bites out of it and had to threw the rest of it away bc it tasted so bad. I went straight to Wendy's after that.|`|ItDHAiOXaa	Here, in Hinesville, GA it's way better than Burger King. Their service and food make me sick. McDonalds is more courteous and doesn't make me sick!|`|TX9aDNekaa	I sure do    I sadly eat there at least once a week, but usually choose the salads and juice instead of the burgers or fries.  In my country, we have a 'McCafe' and its great, because theres a large variety of coffee to choose from, as well as a wide selection of cakes, frappes and other food :)|`|yihKB0A3aa	Well, not particularly... but as an example. I went to Sugar Pine Winter Camp and we ate at Mcdonalds, I didn't care cuz it was either there or Taco Bell and I don't like Taco Bell so i was happier then I would have been.   Their chicken strips, nuggets, and sundaes.   And of course their sodas taste good, but they don't make those.|`|wtRRZWJXaa	yeah love their snack wraps and thats it|`|0UjFOsHkaa	no. if you knew what really was in their meat, you would puke. their fries have beef fat in them which is nasty, but thats why they are so cheap|`|f2Lcv80faa	McDonalds is okay. The food isn't all that good, but I don't mind their milkshakes and their McFlurry's, lol. :)|`|4XXa7wBxaa	No, not really, I don't visit there regularly. Go to restaurants like KFC or burger Kind. that's real food lol! ;-)|`|nfmZZ5Qqaa	yep :D  not everything, though.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	No...|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Yes I do.  I love their food.|`|Y6xanshEaa	>:( Only the french fries and sweet-and-sour sauce.    I don't really like their burgers,but their milkshakes and nuggets are good..Mostly like milkshakes.    Oh and the Filets ;)    Mcdonalds is okay,but it's not one of my favorite ff. resturants.|`|8j70Neqeaa	only if i have to|`|YLJXyS1iaa	Not really|`|JfVxCDb7aa	yes, the food is bad for health in massive quantities, but sure tastes good|`|tI7QP3dkaa	No  - cardboard food with no taste|`|bxjrkRdZaa	Yes but only because it's like driving by an accident - you can't help looking.
hR0Dyym0aa	no i have not ever even heard of it and besides their is no such thing  its not on the menu  they have chocolate mochas|`|VXcp8hvHaa	yes|`|Ca7Xkjqxaa	yeah they do....  if you go to google and type dunkin doughnuts menu you'll find a link for their nutrtion facts which lists a bunch of coolattas.|`|yihKB0A3aa	yes, yes, yes, they taste so good, but I understand what you mean about making them think you are stupid.|`|pEG6SiAraa	Hello, I currently work at Dunkin Donuts...Ask them to make you a Mocha Swirl Coffee Coolatta....if they look at you funny tell them this...  "Just make a regular coffee coolatta but add mocha when you put in the coffee concentrate." If they don't get it after you say that, then they are poorly trained, this is a very easily made drink. Good Luck!!

AA10958272	Technically, it spans the East River.     It was deigned to connect the Cities and jut about unfolds onto City Hall in Manhattan, and leads into Brooklyn's (now) Borough Hall. Walk on it, from either the tip of Center/Chambers Street in Manhattan, or leading on from the Brooklyn side, from Tillary & Brooklyn Bridge Blvd. in Brooklyn Heights. Built in 1883, it's still remarkable to see or drive over, or walk on a warmer day.|`|r8Sme80raa	Brooklyn?|`|JSryPP8faa	Try this website and play the song.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Maes...|`|BKTx9IsZaa	in brookleyn    hahahhaha but seriously why don't you just google like i did? here:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Br...    and      http://snipurl.com/b2wxc|`|UVUYG5jaaa	tokyo|`|VXcp8hvHaa	Tulsa,Oklahoma|`|gaXUIduMaa	Enough of the dumb *** answers.

Ok, it is of course a bridge between NYC and Brooklyn, it is located downtown NYC, down by Pearl Street, down by the Municipal Building and all the court houses and it goes over the east river on to Brooklyn.  You see it as you drive past the South Street Seaport.  Now I have to think where does it end up on the other side.  I believe it's right in the middle of the Heights, near a housing project  of some sort.  And also over by the Esplanade, one of the better parts of Brooklyn, you get one of the best sights of Manhattan that you can get.  You can actually walk across the bridge, it's done all the time by people going to work, those that work downtown.  Hope that works for a real answer.|`|LY1TPqWgaa	um, new york genius. where do u think brooklyn is, dumb *** lol
