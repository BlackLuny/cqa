A8F4HF3Paa	This sounds like a blast. You should definitely have a 'sex ed' room and serve 'sex on the beach' and 'blowj** shots'. Okay, maybe that's a little too dirty for your social event but I can think of tons of fun decorating ideas for that.<br>  <br>  Rusty nail - have a surgical room with a nail coming out of someone's hand<br>  <br>  Fuzzy navel - you get the idea (maybe a delivery room for that one with dolls as newborns)<br>  <br>  Harvey Wallbanger - the room where they keep the psychiatric patients (straight jackets, etc)<br>  <br>  Bone Dry Martini - casts, crutches, X-ray machine<br>  <br>  Between the Sheets - not sure how you'd decorate but maybe bed pans or something<br>  <br>  Buttery nipple - maybe ob/gyn? That might be sort of gross but it's a good drink.<br>  <br>  Mind eraser - a lobotomy room<br>  <br>  I can't think of any more but I hope that helps.

NkEHCHsOaa	Blue Moon wheat beer, Sam Adams Lager, Flat Tire, Guiness with blue berry juice served very cold in a frozen mug, is AWSOME!|`|ZB0393Kkaa	Some of your same selections:<br>  <br>  Killian's <br>  Guinness<br>  Shiner Bock<br>  Zeigenbock Amber<br>  Sam Adams Irish Red Ale<br>  Sam Adams Winter Lager<br>  Sam Adams Black Lager<br>  South Padre Island Pale Ale (DAMN GOOD)<br>  Bud American Ale (this one surprised me...it's actually quite good)<br>  Kona Brewing Company Longboard Island Lager<br>  <br>  P.S., don't worry about alcoholic calories. I managed to lose weight drinking my fair share of heavy beers. You don't store the calories from alcohol.|`|ffbdabbffdb4f137c60d520c03bfb483aa	I dont think we have the same tastes in beer as I hate Guiness, but what the hay, here are my favs:<br>  <br>  1.  Heineken, far & away<br>  2.  Keystone Ice - cheap and VERY effective.  quite tasty, too<br>  3.  Smithwicks!   Awesome beer!<br>  <br>  "To each his own", right?  Love to see the beer-drinking ladies.  Especially the hot ones!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  thats weird, when I tried Budlight with lime, I thought the lime taste was a little overwhelming.  Maybe "Speed Demon" and I got different batches...  Still a tasty summer beer, not an everyday one, though, IMO.|`|c614aa36f47781f6160bcceaebb97251aa	Cold 45 <br>  <br>  Budweiser <br>  <br>  I forget this one, I think it's called Red Stallion <br>  <br>  Budlite's lime beer.<br>  <br>  Yes, actually it is. The lime taste in it is faint, but it's still great.|`|LjTvdl3raa	I like Hornsby's Hard Cider...not really beer, per se, since its first ingredient is cider, but it has a beer-like aftertaste.

d2wu2JCgaa	Some of that is true, yes.  We do get extremely sick from the foods that we eat.  Primarily because we are not eating whole, organic foods.  I myself do the bits of snacking on crap that is in my pantry....but, try to stick to the whole food categories....fruits, veggies, and grains.  My family hates that I make them eat brown rice instead of white, but, what will it hurt?  <br>  People need to be very careful with watching where there food comes from.  We need to wash it, and take extra time when we are purchasing it.|`|P0wMTzDFaa	Yes,it's all true.<br>  I saw it on the news.|`|e00dff88dc30b4a7021797a2956952d6aa	sadly, David, it's true
zQbpJmESaa	GO RIGHT AHEAD AND USE THE CORN OIL IT WILL DO.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	Yes. You can use corn oil. I do it all the time.|`|Fvh6y6chaa	yes because corn is a vegetable.|`|2zC1lpfVaa	Sure you can use it.  Corn oil is even healthier than regular vegetable oil.|`|kjgonYlgaa	no they're not the same, you could still use but would get better flavor using melted butter.|`|2nyWTIVWaa	no|`|G9WJLBFWaa	Corn oil is made from corn. Sounds obvious but it has a more distinct flavor then vegetable oil which is made from very neutral tasting oils. Vegetable oils are also made from a blend of different vegetables versus corn oils are made from corn. Butter is not a substitute for oil. It doesn't have the same cooking properties and burns much quicker. For brownies you will be safe using either but vegetable oil will be less noticeable.|`|UkeWQiioaa	Remember this rule.  Corn is a vegetable.  On the other hand I don't know if I olives are vegetables, but I would never substitute olive oil for vegetable oil to make brownies.   Okay, maybe if I was desperate for chocolate.|`|eAobNmUTaa	Essentially the same, really.  Although vegatable oil is slightly more neutral in flavour, corn oil will be just fine for your brownies. :)

N0dAZjGPaa	Be careful and drink slowly. Some alcohols like Vodka can creep up on you so to speak. If you drink to much to fast it will hit you too strong and you will get really sick and feel like crap the next day. Always drink at least 8oz of water for every drink you have so that a hangover won't be as prevalent the next day. Happy drinking!|`|r4N245AOaa	If you've had alot to drink and have never been drunk before then yes it will probly hit you all at once..usually if i drink alot and im not feeling it, once i sit down and calm down it hits me like a ton of bricks!|`|BaG8yeVVaa	hm lol interesting! when i usually drink it hits me all at once and its usually like 5 min later or when i stand up!|`|z4Xpzm3xaa	you feel lazy

FxAD44Moaa	you're a maintenance  drinker.|`|F08HDRvraa	If you feel you NEED to drink each night rather than want to have a couple of beers and if you actually consume a bottle of wine and a six pack every night, you are what is called a functional alcoholic.  Eventually this will catch up to you and you will no longer be able to function adequately at work, or you will have an accident at work and will be drug tested and they will find you still drunk or with alcohol in your system.|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	It is affecting your brain, whether you realize it or not. Also, the fact that you have to ask this question is a signal that you are questioning yourself. There's no way that, even though you are a functioning alcoholic, that alcohol consumed in that amount is not taking a toll on your body... If you keep this up, your brain will be gone, eventually.<br>  <br>  WHAT ANSWER ARE YOU LOOKING FOR, BY THE WAY? ARE YOU WANTING SOMEONE TO TELL YOU THAT DRINKING THAT AMOUNT ON A DAILY BASIS IS OK AS LONG AS YOU ARE PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF WAKING UP AND PAYING BILLS?! DON'T ASK THIS QUESTION IF YOU DON'T WANT HONEST ANSWERS. YOU CANNOT KEEP THIS UP AND FUNCTION PROPERLY FOREVER. <br>  <br>  You know you have a problem, and you are seeking reassurance to go ahead and continue on with it because you can still properly function. HONEST ANSWER: IT WON'T LAST FOREVER. IF IT DOES, YOU WILL MORE THAN LIKELY SUFFER SEVERE HEALTH PROBLEMS FROM YOUR HABITS, WHILE YOUR BRAIN DETERIORATES.|`|ixmaM395aa	That is certainly not responsible. <br>  <br>  You might be keeping ontop of your life, for now, but it's only a matter of time before this much alcohol will have damaging effects on your health and your life. <br>  <br>  You need to assess why you're drinking this much. Are you unhappy with where you're at in your life? Are you lonely? Bored? <br>  <br>  Because really, that is not a healthy lifestyle and you need to cut waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back on the drinking!|`|iTmzvCVHaa	You didn't say how old you are, but if you're old enough to worry about holding down a job then I guess you've been round the block a couple of times.<br>  As long as your family or no-one you know gets hurt, and you can control where the rest of the money goes, then you're a big boy and good luck.<br>  Anyone asking how all the people who make these drinks we all enjoy get paid?<br>  Live & let live man, just wake up in your own bed and you'll be fine.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Hope your liver can take the strain.|`|UkeWQiioaa	Perhaps this is not a question of alcoholism but rather a question of alcohol abuse.  Either option needs to be addressed. I think that if a person drinks on a daily basis and describes his/her actions as 'need'ing to drink there should be warning bells going off.  A bottle of beer and a six pack is a significant amount of alcohol.  <br>  <br>  Are you sure your drinking doesn't affect anything?  Are you married or a parent?  Often you don't see the effects of drinking.  Isn't that part of the 'beer google' effect? You are not the best person to assess that your drinking isn't doing any harm.  I have had a lot of experience with alcoholism and alcohol abuse in my family.  The effects are far reaching.  If nothing else, think about the money you are spending on this habit.  If you don't have any dependents, you should still be saving for retirement so you can pay to take care of yourself in a decent manner.  <br>  <br>  Is it responsible to drink to the point that if someone called you for help you would question whether you could operate a car or make correct choices.  Responsibility is not a 9 to 5 job.|`|Lq1p2aKpaa	control drinking if you want to save your health..perhaps..as of these moments you're feeling good and you aren't feeling any health problems..you'll just learn later that you'd gonna suffer mental and kidney problems..|`|UNqIE6Acaa	That's basically a functioning alcoholism.  Taking care of business doesn't mean you don't have a problem.

Both of those will intensify the effects of alcohol and make you sick. Next time you drink, make sure you've eaten plenty, and drink lots of water. Also, drink slowly, it's not a race.

You don't have that terrible of a tolerance, you're just drinkin stuff that can be pretty hard on your stomach.

They have a flatter pita bread now, kind of thin like a flour tortilla. Comes with different flavors as do some of the flour tortillas The avocado and Chicken chunks sound great too. Have fun and add chopped black olives, tomato, shredded lettuce,sprouts, or whatever. A yogurt, honey mustard, ranch, or any kind of dipping sauce would be great, or even pour a melted cheese over it. You could make it hot, warm or cold. Seriously have fun with it that is what cooking is all about. You'll probably come up with something better than you remember just trying to re create the original.

F08HDRvraa	No, if you do that the alcohol will evaporate and what's the use of jello shots with no alcohol.  Substitute 1/3 to 1/2 of the water in the jello directions with vodka.  pour into 3 oz dixie cups and refrigerate.|`|yv0LEcqRaa	Definitely add the vodka after you are done boiling the water.  <br>  <br>  Additionally, if you want to forgo all of those little cups, consider making jigglers - you'll use more jello, but in the end you'll have a hand held snack - you can either cut a pan of jello into squares or use cookie cutters to make fun shapes for your party.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|761cff3bc1ac76a800182cc68730713faa	no use it in place of the cold water|`|V7JVKApkaa	Dittos to Anna, and...if you put the vodka in the freezer before mixing with the jello mix, it will set far more rapidly, thus able to consume hours earlier.

5zNwBQZHaa	Prosciutto is a salty Italian dry-cured (cured with salt) ham that is not smoked or cooked. True prosciutto is from Italy's province of Parma.<br>  <br>  Pancetta is also dry-cured and not smoked but it is Italian bacon rather than ham. Since it is bacon, it contains more fat than ham.<br>  <br>  So Pancetta has more fat in it - both have a lot of salt.  Depending on what you want to do with them - they don't necessarily substitute for each other, use what the recipe calls for.|`|VYWaL2graa	Pancetta is basically bacon that hasn't been smoked.<br>  <br>  Prosciutto is ham.

dbTPyM7Yaa	Susan,<br>  Fruit is very heavy, it will weigh the cake down and take much longer to cook. That's an advanced technique, I wouldn't try it for the first time when you are in a hurry. <br>  <br>  What you can do is mix some fruit in a blender or food processor, with some jelly of the same type. Spread that between the layers of the cake for a great taste. With vanilla and chocolate I would use raspberry or orange, they tend to highlight the cake flavors without overpowering it. <br>  <br>  Another last-minute technique you can do is add the fruit to the top of the cake, over the frosting if you are going to use frosting, and drizzle some of the fruit mix from between the layers. If you grate some dark chocolate and white chocolate over the top you will have impressed him to the nth degree!|`|8f56665103aa616bdeed10432894494eaa	            yes,it will.

This might seem like a good idea if you don’t like the idea of having bugs inside you - but in fact the bacteria used to make yoghurt are very good for you.<br>  <br>  With bio-yoghurts, the bacteria used in the production process aren’t killed by the acid in our stomachs. The bacteria avoid being digested themselves and stick to your gut wall and they help your digestion of other foods. They also boost your immune system by reducing the amount of bad bacteria in your gut, which your immune system normally has to kill to protect you.<br>  <br>  If it's a regular Bio yoghurt it should be okay.<br>  If it's a low fat Bio yoghurt I would seriously give it a miss.|`|8nmEXGctaa	yes you can and it will coat the chicken just as well.|`|AA11977808	I use it most of the time<br>  Absolutely no worries there|`|0a92a06fb2c7565638777b7ba8574ec0aa	Yes.

El sofrito es una fritura rápida de cebolla, pimiento verde, ajo, oregano y pimienta en aceite de oliva, y lo que da el sabor típico a muchos platos cubanos.A pesar de que los cubanos están habituados a una mesa pantagruélica, ésta es una cocina saludable, en la que las frituras y las salsas cremosas y pesadas ocupan un lugar secundario. Un desayuno cubano típico consiste en rodajas de pan mojadas en café con leche, una combinación de café fuerte y leche tibia. Las dos comidas del día, el almuerzo y la cena, están compuestas por una mesa llena de comida, generalmente con platos en que se combinan arroz blanco, frijoles y otras legumbres, carnes y ensaladas.Aquí encontrará un peque?o recetario de comidas cubanas, con algunos de los más sabrosos platos de esta gastronomía caribe?a:|`|6beec817c852c8fa894db9f954dc4fc8aa	Los tacos son muy mexicanos|`|049efada0c42e90e1dbba6912801ac58aa	mi comida favorita es la lasag?a aunque no es de Costa Rica me gusta y de mi país es estofado de pollo mmmmm............<br>  saludos.....|`|66e1e359669ddfc30a5743a9292b7e32aa	Me encanta el "sancocho" dominicano, acompa?ado de un arrocito blanco bien graneadito....se hace con gallina vieja, cerdo ahumado (jamón, costillitas y chuleta) y carne "salada" de vaca....también se le pone ?ame, papas las 2 yautias, amarilla y blanca, auyama, yuca, maíz,un plátano, algunos les ponen sus recetas de bollos favoritas, para espesar, mas yo lo prefiero un poco suave, no  muy espeso, se adereza con ajos, pimienta,hierbas, ajies. calditos(o ajinomoto), agrio de naranja, orégano...y puedes poner en el todos los ingredientes q te gustan en una sopa...es delicioso....también me gusta la comida típica q se llama "mangu" cuando esta suave(es un puré de plátanos verdes), o el "chaca" q es como un dulce de maíz con leche y especias...también el moro de guandules con leche de coco, con su pollito guisado en salsa roja...la verdad es q es delicioso....o el locrio de las tres carnes....o las berenjenas con vegetales, huevos y queso, tambien el puerco asado en puya....uy....me fascinan....|`|73e32018d198827d2152fda9ddff788eaa	SOY ESPA?OLA Y ME GUSTA LA TORTILLA DE PATATAS, EL JAMóN, EL PUCHERO, LA FABADA, LA PAELLA, LAS COQUINAS A LA MARINERA, LAS ALMEJAS Y UN LARRGO ETC,JEJEJE, SOY DE TENER BUENA BOCA.<br>  BESOS.|`|g2fHZHRYaa	Mi comida favorita es relleno *****. se hace de pavo, con una pasta de chile quemado la cual se disuelve en agua y con esto se cuece el pavo, la pierna de cerdo y el embutido de carne molida durante toda la noche sobre brasas de carbón. al siguiente día se le a?ade la levadura y tomates enteros junto con unas hojas de epazote, es una comida con mucho sabor, es picosita y a mi me encanta, soy de yucatán, México.

If you can do without beer then then switch to vodka. Try vodka out, why? Well because vodka is a spirit with hardly any methanol and mainly ethanol as the alcohol sugar in it. Meth is 50 times more toxic thant Eth which is why people who drink vodka hardly get hung over compared to those who drink whiskey, rum and even beer and wine. <br>  <br>  If you really want to find out about Beck's then drink it and do the test yourself. Or...go to their website or call their number and try to figure out the percentage of methanol and ehanol in the beer. The lower the methanol the safer and more hangover-free the beer will be. This is besides all the other impurities that can show up in the beer during fermentation. So in short besides being clean a good beer should also have less methanol in relation to the ethanol. The manufacturers don't like you to ponder on that too much but still--try and ask Beck's.

u6cFXfPnaa	You might want to try nutritional bars. Luna bars do contain some soy, so I guess that won't work if you're allergic, but if you just want a soy product that doesn't need refrigeration, that would work. There are many nutrition bars out there for you to chose from. Odwalla bars are pretty good. That is really the perfect type of thing to throw into your purse and snack on when your energy is low. <br>  <br>  Another idea is to grab a protein shake or smoothie with added protein at a Jamba Juice or pick up an Odwalla shake or similar drink at a convenience store. Won't last long in the purse, but a good fix nonetheless.<br>  <br>  Other things... some crackers are high in protein. You might look in health food stores. There are other things like fruit leathers or dried fruit that aren't the best sources of protein, but they'll still help raise the blood sugar. Rice cakes are a good snack. Whole grains are good protein sources. String cheese is good to carry around and will last at least a couple hours or a day in the purse. Another thing might be an enriched cereal, granola, or trail mix. Something like Cheerios isn't super-high in protein (about 3 grams a serving), but it will deliver some nutrients and a bit of protein and tide you over. <br>  <br>  Good luck! |`|vdRHt8XLaa	Try Cliff Bars they are all natural.<br>  <a href="http://www.imedmart.com/Clif-Bar.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.imedmart.com/Clif-Bar.html</a>|`|AA11720613	Beef jerky.|`|kscWCqcWaa	"Organic hemp protein, yellow pea protein, organic brown rice protein"<br>  <br>  I know Vegan sources of protein but i don't know of any way to carry something you can snack on.

What good is having an expensive, highly rated wine if you don't like it?    Also, if I'm not mistaken Franzia comes in a box and the wine is contained in a plastic bladder inside?  That bladder keeps air away from wine much better than a standard corked bottle so it's always fresh.  It gives you the option to decant into a glass or carafe and let it breathe that way (for reds) and with the white, you've always got a fresh glass of wine that probably tastes closer to the way it did when you first opened it.    Nothing wrong with that.|`|8bb58b256a91c180d8b6c1bd11605c17aa	The alcohol % should be on the box. If the economy gets any worse you will be asking a question about "Mad Dog".

n6NthDxwaa	I personally believe it's all politics. Until the gov't legalizes it, it will continue to have a bad rap. However, how bad can it be if they prescribe it to cancer patients to help w/ nausea, eating disorders... you don't really hear about marijuana killings, like drunk driving manslaughter|`|5TBZMx0haa	Like other people said, its labeled as illegal, therefore using it is 'bad' in a majority of peoples' eyes. In my psychology class freshman year in college, the section covering effects of drugs and alcohol made it fairly clear weed is less harmful. But just food for thought, the Prohibition (ban on alcohol in the 1920's) was eventually repealed, albeit with certain limitations still on it. Maybe with enough effort, the same thing can happen with legalizing marijuana Perhaps not, but its just an example of a 'legel-->illegal-->now legal again' change over time. But basically the media/politics tells us its such a terrible idea to legalize it, even though alcohol has its fair share of consequences as a 'legal' substance.|`|4gliQ2H9aa	Weed is "bad" because it is illegal.<br>  That's your answer.<br>  <br>  If it was legal and all of the research behind it was shown on the media it wouldn't be seen as bad as alcohol.<br>  <br>  The only way I see weed as bad is if you drive high or something of the equivalent where not only yourself but others can be affected by it (accident).|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	people say that because they haven't done their research so they don't know any better. they didn't read the studies that have been done that show that there's nothing wrong with it. they probably never even smoked weed themselves. all they know is what they see in the media. they're so comfortable numb that they don't care to know the truth, and that's okay because that's exactly what the media wants.|`|QkIJEG1Gaa	Okay, this is how we have to look at it.  Marijuana is addictive, and with such addiction, people will spend money on it, just to yield to such cravings, and this will have a big impact to society and the user himself.  How?  The more you crave, the more you spend on such drugs, until you find yourself broke... and when you are broke, but still crave for the drug because it's an addiction, you will steal from other people, even if it means killing some people for it, because you are addicted to it, that is a cycle, and you will find yourself having less time for other important things because you are preoccupied pleasuring yourself with these drugs, until you lose everything, your friends, your family, your job.... and one day you will wonder what have you been doing all these years... your classmates are at their peak of success, while you end up in the streets, still craving for the drug that makes you happy.  Now, don't get me wrong, but that wrestler they interviewed with regards to MJ use (Robb Van Dam) is totally stupid!  He doesn't know the effect of such because he can afford the drug (just like other wild celebrities who mess up their life and relationships) and he could have a lifetime supply of such an don't give a damn of what the hell he is saying... but what about others, especially the people form poor countries who crave for such drugs and put those drugs 1st in line, instead of having something to eat 3x a day... these are the people who are in deep need, because they can't break the cycle of addiction, when in fact they can't buy the drug, that they have to steal and kill for it.... and with stealing and killing, you are causing a nation to fall into corruption.  This can happen to America, especially with the financial crisis, people might turn in to drugs because they got laid off, and they will Crave for the drug once they're addicted to it, and since they got laid off, how will they pay for it? I guess you will see and hear of increasing crime rates in the US and we might end up like Colombia or some parts of Mexico where people die because of the drug trade.  To sum it all up, physiologically, it will make you addicted to it, making you crave for some more, and it's impact on society is the one of real concern.  If some people want to have more of Marijuana or other drugs for that matter, they should go to Colombia and other parts where it is grown and be a farmer of such so they can have it all day!

Its foundations were laid by the peasant food of the rural population in an often harsh climate, with a combination of plentiful fish, poultry, game, mushrooms, berries, and honey. Crops of rye, wheat, barley, and millet provided the ingredients for a plethora of breads, pancakes, cereals, kvass, beer, and vodka. Flavourful soups and stews are centered on seasonal or storable produce, fish, and meats. This wholly native food remained the staple for the vast majority of Russians well into the 20th century.<br>  <br>  Russia's great expansions of territory, influence, and interest during the 16th-18th centuries brought more refined foods and culinary techniques. It was during this period that smoked meats and fish, pastry cooking, salads and green vegetables, chocolate, ice cream, wines, and liquor were imported from abroad. At least for the urban aristocracy and provincial gentry, this opened the doors for the creative integration of these new foodstuffs with traditional Russian dishes. The result is extremely varied in technique, seasoning, and combination.<br>  <br>  From the time of Catherine the Great, every family of influence imported both the products and personnel - mainly German, Austrian, and French - to bring the finest, rarest, and most creative foods to their table. This is nowhere more evident than in the exciting, elegant, highly nuanced, and decadent repertoire of the Franco-Russian chef. Many of the foods that are considered in the West to be traditionally Russian actually come from the Franco-Russian cuisine of the 18th and 19th centuries, and include such widespread dishes as Veal Orloff, Beef Stroganoff, Chicken Kiev, and Sharlotka (Charlotte Russe).<br>  <br>  The rest of this article is based mostly on the Russian cuisine chapter in the popular Soviet cookbook "Cuisines of Soviet ethnicities" by the food writer V. Pokhlyobkin and concentrates on peasant and pre-18th century Russian cooking.<br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Soups<br>   <br>  Russian borsch.Soups have always played an important role in the Russian meal. The traditional stable of soups such as shchi, borsch, ukha, rassolnik, solyanka, botvinya, okroshka, and tyurya was enlarged in the 18th to 20th centuries by both European and Central Asian staples like clear soups, pureed soups, stews, and many others.<br>  <br>  Russian soups can be divided into at least 7 large groups:<br>  <br>  Cold soups based on kvass, such as tyurya, okroshka, and botvinya. <br>  Light soups and stews based on water and vegetables. <br>  Noodle soups with meat, mushrooms, and milk. <br>  Soups based on cabbage, most prominently shchi. <br>  Thick soups based on meat broth, with a salty-sour base like rassolnik and solyanka. <br>  Fish soups such as ukha. <br>  Grain- and vegetable-based soups. <br>  <br>  [edit] Cold Soups<br>  Okroshka is a cold soup based on kvass or less often - sour milk. The main ingredients of both types are vegetables that can be mixed with cold boiled meat or fish in a 1:1 proportion . Thus vegetable, meat, and fish varieties of okroshka are made.<br>  <br>  There must be two sorts of vegetables in okroshka. The first must have a neutral taste, such as boiled potatoes, turnips, rutabagas, carrots, or fresh cucumbers. The second must be spicy, consisting of mainly green onion as well as other herbs -- greens of dill, parsley, chervil, celery, or tarragon. Different meat and poultry can be used in the same soup. The most common ingredient is beef alone or with poultry. If it is made with fish, the best choice would be tench, European perch, pike-perch, cod, or other neutral-tasting fish.<br>  <br>   <br>  Kvas is a Russian bread-based drink and an ingredient in many soups.The Kvass most commonly used in cooking is white okroshka kvass, which is much more sour than drinking kvass. Spices used include mustard, black pepper and pickled cucumber (specifically, the liquid from the pickles), solely or in combination. For the final touch, boiled eggs and smetana (a heavy sour cream, similar to crème fra?che) are added.<br>  <br>  For sour milk based okroshka, well shaken up natural sour milk(often with addition of seed oil) is used with addition of some pure water and ground garlic. Sometimes manufactured kefir is used instead of natural sour milk for time saving reason in spite of harmful effect to original taste of okroshka.<br>  <br>  Tyurya is very similar to okroshka, the main difference being that instead of vegetables, bread is used.<br>  <br>  Botvin`ya is one of the most typical cold Russian soups. It almost become extinct because it is difficult to make. Some modern cookbooks list recipes showing how to prepare it "easily" by substituting some of the ingredients, but cutting corners tends to diminish much of the authentic taste.<br>  <br>  A full botvin'ya consists of three parts:<br>  <br>  The soup. <br>  Boiled "red" (most prized) fish (salmon, sturgeon, or stellate sturgeon), that is served separately from soup. <br>  Crushed ice, served on a separate platter or cup. <br>  The nam|`|S87USMKLaa	you gotta be more specific sir!|`|F2ugW4cRaa	Russian Black Bread recipe -<br>   <br>  · Ingredients<br>  3 tb dry yeast<br>  1 ts sugar<br>  1 c lukewarm water<br>  3/4 c rye flour<br>  2 c wholewheat flour<br>  1 ts salt<br>  1 c oat bran<br>  1 ts caraway seeds<br>  1 ts fennel seeds<br>  2 tb cider vinegar<br>  2 tb dark molasses<br>  2 tb corn oil<br>  1 tb minced onion <br>  <br>  <br>  Dissolve yeast and sugar in about 1/2 c water and set aside till yeast is foamy.

Bottles run about $7.99-10.  Check your local liquor stores and see if they use Major Brands as their distributor.    Friendship Red is a semi-dry red and goes great with steaks or pasta.    If your local distributors don't carry it, try going to www.stjameswinery.com      If you want to skip over the red wine and do a white wine, the Vintner's Select Vignoles is superb!  They just came out with their 2007 vintage.  This will go good with spicey foods, creamy pasta, shrimp, fish, turkey, chicken, cheeses . . . pepper jack cheese complimented with some cheddar would be very nice also.|`|kT8rhVdLaa	me personally i hate red wines expect for syrah or shirz, these are a sweeter and not as dry as a merlot .|`|xuowtZLqaa	A nice shiraz will have a fruitier, lighter flavour and won't be so dry. Or, why not try a rose wine? Very romantic & much lighter than a traditional red. If you are thinking champagne, go for a good brand like Henkels. Unless you are mixing your champagne with a fruit juice, it is best to get a good quality. Have fun!|`|M5SkiSOzaa	Skip red wine.  Try a Rose or another fruity, sparkling wine.
zQbpJmESaa	Vegetarian Meal <br>   Nidhi Chanani, a lifelong vegetarian, streamlined her mother’s matter paneer recipe to make a meal her friends love. “My mother’s version takes twice as long and uses lots of heavy cream and ghee [clarified butter],” she says.

Sterilize a glass jar and lid. Buy whole heads of garlic, make sure they are fresh and don't have any soft or brown spots, they will be heavy for their size if they are fresh. Carefully peel the excess paper off the outside without separating the cloves. Take a sharp paring knife and trim off the bottom root part as much as you can to clean it up without separating the cloves. Pack the cloves in the jar. Mix a little salt with vinegar and pour over the garlic to the top. Put some plastic wrap on the jar and then the lid. (The vinegar will bubble up and corrode the lid if it is metal if you don't use plastic).  Leave the jar somewhere undisturbed, better in a garage or someplace above freezing. That jar of garlic will work and reek off a smell for a few weeks. When it stops working, the garlic is done, usually about 6 weeks when I've made it.
2sPGCkz4aa	try middle eastern/mediterranean food.  it's healthy, vegetarian, simple to make, and has an exotic and romantic appeal to it    1. appetizer: hummus and fresh pita bread wedges and olives.   most supermarkets carry small tubs of already-made hummus dip    2. salad: tabouli salad (cucumber based salad)  again, certain supermarkets or health markets carry already-made tabouli...if not it's easy to make from scratch. there are several recipes on the web    3. main course: falafel balls with yogurt sauce and rice.  check the supermarket's freezer section for frozen falafel balls.    falafel is made from chickpeas.  very simple to deep fry them using olive oil for only 4 minutes! and they taste fresh & GREAT!    4. dessert: baklava    good luck! :)|`|M9RJLpqEaa	Appetizer:Vegetable soup or Sweet Corn soup with a plate of veggi spring rolls.

So here are some recipes with Italian cooking:     Appetizer: Bruschetta is so good!   http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Double-Toma...    Main: Ravioli is great for dates because most girls hate it when they have to look messy eating spaghetti. Make the following recipe EXACTLY how it says or it won't turn out. If you follow the directions, its fantastic! I would also suggest getting the ravioli from a local market so its fresher.   http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada...    Dessert: Chances are, you'll be very full. So finish it off with something light. I love chocolate strawberries with whipped cream, their sexy and yummy!  http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-...  If your not up to making chocolate strawberries (They are a pain in the butt) then I would go to a local market and get some fresh cannolis or another Italian dessert.|`|FlsrXuJOaa	first course: salad made of fresh mozzarella slices, tomato slices, chopped fresh basil, pine nuts marinated for an hour in white wine vinegar salt and pepper and olive oil.     second course: veggie lasagna...delicious and super easy to prepare    dessert: cheesecake or frozen custard w/ strawberries.|`|432d817139a5e0be18e400a33e0e1908aa	I'd go with Italian as well. Fortunately, there are loads of dishes that just don't happen to contain meat.     The starter doesnt actually involve any cooking and can be made in advance. The main course does have to be cooked at the time, but you can prepare some of the ingredients in advance, it doesnt take long and it allows you to show off your culinary skills. The dessert can be "taken elsewhere", if you know what I mean, postponed or even dispensed with completely.     For a wine, I recommend a Soave, or a good quality Pinot Grigio.     The starter is a simple Mozzarella cheese and tomato salad. The original recipe uses a sliced sweet Spanish onion as well but, under the circumstances, Ive left this out. You can make this in advance, cover it with cling film and keep it in the fridge.    MOZZARELLA & TOMATO SALAD     Serves 2    INGREDIENTS    100g packet of Mozzarella cheese  1 large beef tomato  1 small bunch of fresh basil  2 tablespoons of olive oil  Ground pepper to taste    METHOD    Open the pack of cheese and drain off the liquid. Wash the tomato. Wash and chop the basil.     Cut the cheese into an equal number of slices. Cut off the top and bottom off of the tomato, and then cut it into an equal number of slices.     Arrange the cheese and tomato on two small plates, overlapping the slices. Sprinkle on some of the chopped basil. Dribble on the olive oil. Season with the pepper.     ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES    Add some stoned olives. Ideally, you should use extra virgin olive oil for salads. However, if you only have the normal stuff, you can use that instead.     Serve with ciabatta or focaccia bread.     The main course is one of my favourites, tagliatelle in a cream sauce. I dont know of any other dish, which gives such a luxurious result yet only uses so few simple ingredients.       TAGLIATELLE IN A CREAM SAUCE    Serves 2    INGREDIENTS     2 cloves of garlic  1 tablespoon of olive oil  1 tablespoon of flour  150ml carton of single cream  1 teaspoon of mixed herbs (or some more of the basil from the salad)  At least 300ml of water    ? of a teaspoon of salt  200g of tagliatelle (see below)  Ground pepper to taste    METHOD    Peel the garlic and chop it into tiny pieces.     Put the oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. Add the garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes until the onion has gone soft. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. Add the flour and stir until it has absorbed the oil and juices in the pan. Add the cream and herbs. Stir and cook for about a minute until it has made a smooth sauce.     Put the water and salt into a saucepan on a medium heat. Bring to the boil. Add the pasta. Stir it to stop it sticking to the bottom of the pan. Bring back to the boil and continue to cook. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. (Memorise and use this phrase: Gli spaghetti amano la compagnia, which is Italian for spaghetti loves company.)     Begin testing it about 2 minutes before the packet instructions say it should be done. The best way to judge if pasta is cooked is to bite it. This is tricky, because if you fish out a bit and stick in your mouth you may burn your mouth on the boiling water. Wait a bit and blow on it, then bite it. If it is hard it needs longer. If it is chewy (or al dente, Italian for to the teeth) it is ready. If it is soft it is overcooked.      Drain the pasta in a sieve or colander.     Put the pasta in the pan with the sauce and stir together until thoroughly coated. (Explain to your partner that this is because an Italian would always bring the pasta to the sauce, not just plonk a dollop of sauce on top of the pasta. At this point, your status as a domestic god should be pretty well guaranteed.)    Season with the pepper. Sprinkle on a little more of the chopped fresh basil.     ADDITIONS & ALTERATIONS    Use crme fra?che instead of the cream.     The half cream, half green mixed tagliatelle (called paglia e fieno, or straw and hay) looks really good with this sauce. (It also gives you yet another Italian phrase to drop into the conversation.)    Serve with some more ciabatta or focaccia bread.     TIPS    If you use enough water, add the pasta when the water is boiling, stir the pasta frequently and dont wander off (Remember, Gli spaghetti amano la compagnia, or spaghetti loves company) and dont overcook it, adding olive oil to the water to stop it sticking is totally unnecessary.     The dessert is just three scoops of good quality ice cream, one each of strawberry, vanilla  and mint. It can be taken elsewhere, if you know what I mean. If your partner has eaten enough, this course can be left for later or even dispensed with in a suitably nonchalant manner.|`|3120pXzcaa	starter- Tomato soup with croutons in a heart shape on top  main course- anything homemade in red or heart shapes  DESSERT- (this is the most important course!!)

vvoz2jeyaa	any fresh fish should smell like salt water not "fish" fish that smells fishy is not fresh and should not be consumed to be safe. As a retired chef  if fish or seafood of any sorts smells "fishy" i wont buy it. if it smells fishy it will taste fishy and it will not be at its best flavors. fresh fish shouldn't need to be soaked in anything which would only mask the process of old food (spoilage) it may taste ok but there is a risk of getting sick. just toss it out and get something else for your meal. play it smart. but lemon juice will work.  Your health and life are more important than cooking bad food. Take it from a professional here. If you bought the fish yesterday take it back to the store with the receipt and get some more or better yet just get your money back. I ALWAYS use fish the same day I buy it.

Do you take the mayonnaise out of the coleslaw? I give up, I really don't understand people's reasoning.    Chris|`|ae5b94582952d6bd5e0f06acc5f5bf04aa	Most good cooks will tell you if it smells fishy ..its not fresh .SAlmon as it cooks has a light odor , it is often eaten raw .I love it blackened .If you don't have a blackened  spice recipe you can easily buy a bottle of jerk or blackened season  in the spice isle at your local grocery store .It is also wonderful with a little lemon , pepper seasoning ...or look up a recipe for pecan encrusted salmon ..absolutely wonderful .I have several but usually just throw it together and wouldnt want to mislead you with directions .I dont often measure things and  it confuses a lot of folks .have a fun time .cooking is therapy!|`|dwpdUFpDaa	If the fish is fresh, it should smell like the sea, not "fishy".  Also, make sure you trim the grey-colored parts off if you want, as it is the fat and carries the strongest fish flavor in not just salmon, but all fish.|`|w1FOvD9Faa	If fish smells or tastes strongly 'fishy', then it's starting to go bad - the characteristic 'fishy smell' comes from bacteria that produce volatile amines. Fresh fish should smell more like seaweed.    If your salmon is just starting to go past its best but you don't want to throw it away, try using lime or lemon juice or vinegar to marinade it - the acids react with the amines and protonate the fishyness.|`|ATpKrr2Oaa	soak it in milk.|`|4d80afe3510fcec9f8c8cce72cafd379aa	Lemon juice.  Incorporate it into your recipe and it'll be delicious and not taste as fishy.|`|Eb3SnljMaa	not gona happen really since it is fish..but try rinsing it with warm water...just rinse...    then with the seasonings or maranade you use, it will help cover the fishy smell and taste a little
llkSmgLJaa	I've never read a study on it, but I bet meat eaters learn to ignore their sense of smell. They do this to get past the smell of death and decay. You will get used to your enhanced abilities soon.     BTW: if the smell of the eggs is that bad you may want to toss them.|`|5DB6nOXkaa	No, that is a symptom of pregnancy though.|`|b9uOax0aaa	I have not gone through that.

But I'm so sorry you're getting sick from the smell of foods... I don't experience that... I know that certain things like cigarettes and food can deaden your smell and taste, so maybe you just haven't adjusted yet? Possibly try other foods... or just use the basics; keep a fan in the kitchen, sit next to windows or outside in restaurants, keep your windows open.   Congrats on being vegetarian though!!|`|ysES3F75aa	Am I the only vegetarian who hasn't gained super powers sense changing?

Adding more protein but not more calories or exercise to your diet won't help you build more muscle mass, but it may put your other bodily systems under stress.    Eating more protein and increasing total caloric intake while maintaining the same exercise level will build an equal amount of additional fat and muscle mass.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	It is possible to have a condition call protein poisoning but this isn't so much that you are eating too much protein as it is that you are not eating enough fat and carbohydrates relative to the amount of protein you are taking in.  The condition is rare and it takes months of high protein diet to develop.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	An excessive amount of protein puts stress on the liver as your body tries to get rid of the unused protein.|`|SCiY5JESaa	You get fat and HIGH cholesterol

cxNLOPHNaa	Real Nabisco Oreo cookies are completely vegetarian. They fat comes from vegetable shortening. Target's own brand should be the same. You should be able to see either vegetable shortening or vegetable oils on the ingredient's list. It might include the actual type of oil as well. Such as Palm, Soybean, Corn, Cottonseed, etc...<br>  <br>  The chocolate cookie portion, contains a small amount of fat. But the bulk of the shortening is in the "cream filling" which actually contains no cream at all.<br>  <br>  You can make your own "Oreo"s easily from a cake mix, if you want to be sure that you're eating an all veg product. You will find the copycat recipe in the source box.|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	Back to Nature makes Oreo type cookies in regular and mint. They are vegan and you can read every ingrediant on the box and know what it is. I recommed them over Oreos b/c the Oreos have some weird things in them.|`|u93oneUXaa	Look at the ingredients - I don't know exactly what they're made of because the ingredient list is probably a paragraph - and just google whatever ingredient you don't understand.|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	oreo plants|`|lHlFxeaCaa	Oreos are commercially made, they are a cheap cookie to make that satisfies people's lust for calories for a short amount of time. Oreos are sometimes mistaken for being Vegan, which is not true.<br>  <br>  Oreos contain White refined sugar, a sugar that is as stated, refined. This sugar is refined through a charcoal filter...charcoal for filtration contains animal bones...So Oreo's have a refined sugar which is refined with animal charcoal.|`|LclLMqU4aa	The Chocolate Cookie Is Just Chocolate Made Into A Cookie I Believe And The Filling Is Vegetable Shortening and Vanilla.|`|Z2FVXeNEaa	chocolate cookies and cream i think u can eat them|`|llkSmgLJaa	Read the ingredient list, your looking for the word lard.

If any of the eggs float to the top, they are bad.|`|V7JVKApkaa	Eggs need not be refrigerated. They only go bad faster if stored on the counter. Unchilled eggs should be eaten within a week.

vs5rK3iRaa	1) Toast bread<br>  2) Remove from toaster<br>  3) put cheese on it<br>  <br>  Or were you trying to make a grilled cheese sandwich?  If so, then you butter two slices of bread, put one in a hot skillet with the butter side down, put some cheese on top and place the other piece of bread on top with the butter side facing up.  Let it cook for a few minutes until it is brown, then use a spatula or tongs to flip it over and brown the other side.<br>  <br>  Note:  Someone posting earlier said put cheese on bread and put it in the toaster.  Do not do this unless you are using a toaster oven!|`|0652e17f9d7b965dbf45d90fb460f124aa	<a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Cheese-Toast/Detail.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Cheese-Toas...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.about.com/food/hubsearch.htm?TopNode=/&terms=cheese%20on%20toast%20&SUName=food" rel="nofollow">http://www.about.com/food/hubsearch.htm?...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_on_toast#Recipes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_on_t...</a>|`|AA11786341	It can be made by grilling one side of a couple of bits of bread, then turning them over, putting slices of cheese (normally cheddar) on, and then grilling until it melts.

aNlT1NRqaa	Loose tea leaves can be steeped twice. Tea bags should only be used once, otherwise the second cup will probably be more bitter. Loose tea should be 1 teaspoon (regular, not measure) per 6-8 oz of near boiling water (boil water, wait 20-30 seconds & pour) or 1 teabag per cup. Steep for about 3-4 minutes (some say up to 7, but I think that's pushing it). If using loose tea in a proper iron kettle, don't use the included infuser; take it out. Use the infuser when pouring into cup as a strainer.<br>  <br>  I like my tea straight, but I will sometimes put buckwheat honey into white tea. Lemon is popular for tea, but I've never been fond of milk in mine. When I do use milk (vanilla soy) to make a latte for my wife and I, the milk has to be hot too.|`|JEZ5j86Iaa	I think you can only use the tea bag once, and you can guess the amount of water (estimate)...it's no biggie lol.|`|O40b66Lhaa	do research on food social netwoking.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	I usually steep a tea bag twice before I throw it away. After that, it doesn't do much.  I keep it on a little dish while I drink my first cup.<br>  <br>  You should try Stash teas.  Check out their website. I like them way better than Tazo and Sleepytime.
YB9hxefFaa	<a href="http://www.boags.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.boags.com.au/</a><br>  <br>  Boag was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland.

bfKOXAxraa	You can use 2 pots, with one inside the other.  This would be easier to do than using a pot and a bowl as the 2cd pot would have a handle.  Try to keep the upper pot out of the water in the first pot.  The upper pot is supposed to be warmed by the steam from the bottom pot.|`|sP98NDi5aa	Put a metal bowl atop of a pot of boiling water. The glass must have come into contact with something cold, or just had a microscopic crack in it already and heating it just made it worse. Don't use plastic, it will melt. Ceramic might work, but it too may crack like glass.|`|OxWmtBSYaa	use a *metal* bowl and saucepan.<br>  plastic would not work at all and ceramic will probably take a longer time to heat. you might also have trouble reaching the correct consistency depending on what youre making.|`|13wBSFe5aa	I sure wouldn't try the Tupperware and if you have nice ceramic..  I wouldn't use that either.<br>  <br>  Best thing to use is glass Pyrex..|`|vs5rK3iRaa	A big stainless steel mixing bowl is best.  No plastic!|`|F08HDRvraa	Plastic will melt.
