First, they go to a shop that will pat for them, then mark them way up for resale. Some that they don't want go to a Paperback Trader, for credit against buying other books. The ones they don't want go to a thrift shop or the library as donations. Barring these, they can be recycled. For a while, our township used to sell books to a company that made boards for games. You know, the things that would get the whole family together around the table after dinner, in the years before computer games. Once, I even picked up a carton of books just to recycle the book boards. I do some home bookbinding and repair.

AA11105711	Why yes it did.  If you compare that to the temperature data you can see that temperatures remained relatively flat during that time.    http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs...    In addition if you look at figure 4, you can see that solar irradiance peaked around 1960.  The solar irradiance has gone down a little or remained relatively flat since that time, yet temperatures have increased.    There goes that "it is all the sun" theory down the tubes.    Edit: I don't see how removing high frequency noise is going to change how the data looks.  This data is nothing like the  music on an mp3 unless maybe you are recording the sound from a pure tone.  Are you suggesting there is some information that can be obtained in the time domain that is not readily apparent?|`|nunZMnhWaa	I recently found this history of the sunspot cycle and its implications and note that while the sun is certainly a major climate driver there have to be some additional ones neither warmers or skeptics are seeing. For instance the Maunder and Dalton minimums are clearly visible showing the sun was a major player in the little ice age and that the beginning point for the alarmists was in a scientifically documented period of unusual cold climate. So when they talk about an unusual rise in climate temps they are already in dubious territory truth wise.    Now there is no evidence in the sunspot cycle for the 1930/40 warm period that brought us the famous dust bowl and other related temperature problems of the period. The 1950s, 60s and 70s were defiantly cool years on everybodys charts sometimes dipping back to 1900 temperatures and yet this was a period of high activity and rising co2 output from ocean out gassing. What is needed is relevant ocean temperature readings tied into the solar cycle and possibly other factors such as Hydrothermal activity.     http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/Sunspo...    The history of sunspots graphed.  http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/images...|`|9fbe56a44d7b6024062aa6bacbc528e4aa	During that period there were solar two cycles but if the trend was smoothed your link shows an increase in solar output by ~.3 W/M2 which would account for a temperature increase of ~0.225 C., however temperature record shows during that same period (1945 through 1960) a global temperature decrease of ~.28 C.  If the trend was extended and smoothed to present day solar irradiance has remained relatively unchanged, but there has been an increase in global temperature by ~.5C.  Though the PDO does appear to moderate global temperature somewhat, its clear that there are definite disconnects between the PDO and global temperature especially when compared with the North American temperature record, which the PDO more closely resembles, but not without distinct disconnects there too.  This must therefore indicate that the PDO is only a moderator of regional temp, to a lesser extent global.  It is far from a driver of global temperature, and may instead be influenced by global temperature.  Regardless of how the PDO moderates temperature we still have the main indicator of a climate change, the global energy imbalance.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	I'll grant you that the peak around 1959 was slightly higher than the peak around 1948.  This doesn't change the fact there has been no non-negligible increase in TSI from 1945-Present, which Figure 4 in your own link illustrates.  TSI has been approximately 1366 W/m^2 for the past 60 years.    You argument is "a combination of increased solar activity and the PDO cause the warming between 1945 to present."  PDO has had 1 warm and 1 cold cycle of equal and opposite strength over that period, so to argue it's caused any warming is just laughable.  TSI has not increased on average over that period either, so again, blaming solar activity is laughable.    LOL only a denier could think 1-1=2.    And I love that "peer-reviewed literature".  You mean one peer-reviewed study, which basically nobody besides Scaffeta&West thinks is accurate, and ignoring the dozens of studies which have put the solar contribution at 0-10%.    So basically you've got zero contribution from PDO and 0-35% from the Sun.  You're missing 65-100% of the warming.|`|4aY6PQvcaa	try out this xtunnel (dot) cn|`|YWGj1aghaa	i found & read several articles which stated that solar flakes gained intensities during recent years........it however is a part of life cycle of every star as stated by scientist , so not issue of  great worry..yes but certain changes might be experienced by earth & other celestial bodies in the system.....

nunZMnhWaa	1.) Have you ever participated in a validity or perception/credibility poll?  Yes several of them over a period of more than 50 years,  2.) Were any of them about environmental issues such as Global warming?  Yes, but only one.  3.) Do you believe either these polls or your answers had bias?  Being as all of them were of the multiple choice variety the poll had bias designed into it as any answer you gave reflected unfavorably on their opposition.  4.) Do you believe participant's are chosen randomly?  In most but not all cases at least in the mall or telephone based ones I have seen most recently.  5.) I'm also curious about the testing techniques used?  The techniques are deliberately designed, as are the questions to give the product, politician or issue the result they want.    Every poll of the current type I have ever encountered has a focused agenda and all the questions are of the when did you stop beating your wife type with responses laid out in the one day to 5 year period. The only way to vote I have never beaten mine or do not have a wife to beat is to not answer the question, which immediately invalidates the poll, which says all questions must be answered.|`|SIWh4UCyaa	1) Have you ever participated in a validity or perception/credibility poll?

pnCOR1UVaa	Going green is easy, there are so many great resources about the subject. My personal favorite is "The Green Book" which has parts of its book online as well at www.readthegreenbook.com.    As I have been striving to "Go Green" I realize it is like stepping back in time without getting rid of my modern conveniences. I'm doing many things I learned as a child, like line drying my clothes, sweeping instead of vacuuming, opening the windows in the morning to catch the cool breeze, only buying what I need instead of everything that looks cool, growing some of my own food, and canning what I can't eat now.     To me "going Green" is a frame of mind. Do what fits your lifestyle and do the easy things first, it is a process and like dieting if you go to radical to soon, you are more likely to go back to bad habits. I also believe there are good, better, best choices in most things. If you aren't ready to start a home garden, then try finding a farmers market, until you locate one look for produce grown as close to home as possible and go organic when available.     Many people think "going green" is expensive, I disagree. Some changes may take an initial investment, but they usually have a short payoff time. Things like weatherstiping and insulation cost, but the energy savings will add up quickly. You may need to purchase reusable bags, but most stores give you a 5 or 10 cent credit, so you are paid back within a few months.     My top tips are make your home more energy efficient, that also means using natural light, cooling and heating.     Reduce your packaging, if you eat more fresh food you will generally reduce packaging, it's the same thing they tell dieters, shop the perimiter, that is where all the meat, dairy and produce are located. Only buy what you will use, many Americans throw away a lot of unused food. Buy in bulk, that doesn't just mean large packages, but that area with the bins that you buy only what you plan on using.     Replace disposable items with durable items, if you eat outside often and use disposable paper or plastic plates, it is a wise investment to purchase a set of reusable plastic plates. Replace disposable razors, diapers and cleaning products like swiffer. Avoid bottled water, get a home filter like Pur or Brita.    Recycle, www.earth911.org will help you locate the nearest recycle center. I try to only purchase plastics that are  1 or  2, they are more easily recycled. I also buy recycled products when available, that includes paper towels, napkings, toilet paper, tissue, school/office supplies and clothing.    Detox your cleaning, vinegar and baking soda clean almost anything, they can even losen a hair clog. Seventh Generation and Method are a couple mainstream brands that are very earth friendly.

AA11562326	I'm with g.aidono.  The efficiency of the panel is not the issue, it's the cost.    I believe photovoltaic panels are hovering at around 14% efficiency right now - when you see high numbers like 41%, that's an exotic cell, and not in a sturdy glass and metal frame suitable for domestic use.  But even at 14%, if they cost $2 / watt, they would be a cost winner in a majority of US homes.  Even at $4 / watt today, they are a winner in some places, such as supplying the last few, very expensive kWh's on someone's bill.  If panels got to $1 / watt, even without any subsidies, people would be clamoring to connect panels - so many, in fact, that it would threaten the stability of the grid, and new architectures would be necessary.|`|npBCankMaa	current panels have 30% to 35% efficiency, yet in the NE they can only capture about 4 hours of sun at their peak design.  Going to say 50% efficient panels, that number will be 4.1 hours of sun.  SO even a 100% efficient panel will net 6 hours of sun per day on the average.  If you add in a electronic tracking system, then maybe 7 hours is achievable.    So you see, the panel efficiency doesn't increase the overall efficiency much, what it will do is lower the up front cost, but not enough to make PV panels cheaper than a coal or nuke plant.    If you add in the cost for batteries to allow you to use PV panels all the time, the cost will go up 50% and then there is no way to justify a PV panel.|`|fp9bOiVFaa	While I think efficiency is one aspect of the equation I think cost and finding a decent storage medium will be much more important.

If the price go down enough then there will be no problem with the commercial efficiencies already achieved.    The big challenge for the solar industry is to achieve the famous grid - parity. We should notice however that the grid parity will not come at the same time to all countries in the world since there are several irradiation levels and electricity prices as well.     As so the answer to the modified question is that very soon (2-3 years)  if the solar industry continue to expand at today rates we will achieve the grid - parity at many places in the world

For example, people in Europe didn't know about people in China or America.  The world was "too big" for them to find out.    of course, certain explorers came along, like Alexander the Great and Christopher Columbus.  Both of those PROVED that there were other people in other lands that nobody had known about before.    Even so, it took Alexander the Great YEARS to travel to China, and it took months for Christopher Columbus to sail to America.  And of course, without a radio it was impossible for anybody to communicate with them while they were gone.  Columbus sort of "proved" the world was round, but it took a LONG time for the news to get back home.    As other countries, like England, colonized the Americas and the Far East, it became necessary for regular communications to occur.  That resulted in message being sent by horseback, camel, or ship. It still took weeks for a message to be delivered but still a lot faster than Columbus or Alexander.  The world is still big, but SEEMS to be getting smaller.    Soon, dedicated mail delivery systems were devised.  These groups served no other purpose than to deliver messages.  They could get there as fast as they could.  It STILL took a ship several weeks to get from England top America, but it took the Pony Express only a few days to go from New York to the California area.  The world seems to be getting smaller.    Soon, the "wirelss" was invented.  you could sent short message using Morse Code to anywhere they had strung the necessary wires.  Electricity travels at the speed of light, so now short messages could get to where they needed to be almost as fast as you could think them!  But there were STILL some areas of the world, like Africa or South America, where messages had to be carried by hand on horses or boats, or even by foot.    Of course, radio improved.  Soon, you could send Morse Code with NO wires, and so you could talk to ships at sea.  What used to be isolated were now seemingly close at hand.    And soon, you could actually send voices!  Instead of needing someone to translate your short message into Morse code, you could actually SPEAK to the other person through either radio or telephone.    Of course, movies came in, too.  it was now possible for people to actually SEE what was goign on in other parts of the world, like the famous "newscasts" played before movies during WW-II.     Then television comes in. And it gets better and better. FM Radio is invented.  Color Television. Communications satellites. internet , , , , ,    It is now to the point, using the interent, to have "virtual meetings".  People in different counteis can all meet together "in the same room" at the same time, using small video cammers, microphones, computers, and the internet.     Even though they are separetd by thousands of miles, it SEEMS like they are right in the same room!    So while the physical size of the earth is NOT changing, through technology we make it APPEAR that distances are small and times are much shorter.|`|AA11612451	"The world getting smaller" refers to the fact that, with increased technology, transportation and communication across vast distances are commonplace.|`|65de15f23f2269f4a1cd8334a7b742f9aa	I would say that 'the world getting smaller' is mainly due to advances in communication.

People who believe in AGW derive their beliefs from other people.  They'll stop believing tomorrow if their chosen sources in the media tell them to.

CO2 is a greenhouse gas and it is undeniable that more should warm up the air.  The problem with the theory is that climate is more complicated than simple science would suggest.  There are all sorts of feedback mechanism and variables like the unknown but apparently real effect from sun spots or the sun's magnetic field.  Other variables include cloud formation, water vapor, ocean temperature, the Earths variable rotation and orbits and other factors.  The models that are the basis of the science haven't been demonstrated by actual increased warming which should reach a maximum at about 10,000 feet for any warming to be called greenhouse warming.  Science requires verification so it seems, at least, that the warming from humans is on low end of the scale and that probably makes it not significant or harmful.  The politics comes into it because the movement is led by leftists that want to use it to gain power and punish capitalism.  They have been too long indoctrinated into the idea that humans are destroying the planet so they won't accept anything except dire consequences of anything modern people do.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	I don't understand your question. What do you mean by support? Support can have many meanings. I don't root for global warming, the way I support my favorite team. I don't pay for global warming, the way I pay taxes to support the government.    The climate of the earth is a natural process. It cycles over eons between warming and cooling. The dinosaurs lived during a warm period, which was followed by glaciers that covered much of north america during one of the ice ages. I don't support this process, but I believe it exists.    Now take man's activities and factor them in. Can we reverse these natural cycles? Not likely. Can we affect them? Quite possibly. How do we determine the effect? We take measurements over a number of years and look for a trend. The number of years it takes to find a statistically significant trend depends on the amplitude of the change observed. There is no one correct answer to your hypothetical question.    As yet man-made global warming can't be proven, nor can it be disproven. The climate scientists will tell us all when the data is strong enough to make a declarative statement. Until then we should continue to monitor the situation, take logical steps to limit our impact on the climate, and let the scientists do their job without interference from either right wing conservatives, or left wing liberals.|`|i5MiFhMyaa	So today we have the acceptance of carbon dioxide as the culprit of global warming. It is concluded that when we burn fossil fuels we are leaving a dastardly carbon footprint which we must pay Al Gore or the environmentalists to offset. Our governments on all levels are considering taxing the use of fossil fuels. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency is on the verge of naming CO2 as a pollutant and strictly regulating its use to protect our climate. The new President and the US congress are on board. Many state governments are moving on the same course.    We are already suffering from this CO2 silliness in many ways. Our energy policy has been strictly hobbled by no drilling and no new refineries for decades. We pay for the shortage this has created every time we buy gas. On top of that the whole thing about corn based ethanol costs us millions of tax dollars in subsidies. That also has driven up food prices. And, all of this is a long way from over.    And, I am totally convinced there is no scientific basis for any of it.    Global Warming. It is the hoax. It is bad science. It is a high jacking of public policy. It is no joke. It is the greatest scam in history.|`|SIWh4UCyaa	Anyone with a real science background is familiar with the concept of new evidence or new advances changing the foundation of a theory but such new advances are still subject to testing.

With current PV solar technology, a car would look like mini aircraft carriers with a long deck of panels to be something that could actually charge the car in of itself.    I get a sense that there is so much green guilt going on these days, that anything that remotely sounds green, like even a mere solar panel, would be considered something special. If the added price is below $1000 for a 200 watt panel, it might be okay to have, but you can spend the money on a simple panel and hook it to your house to be more effective, as you can focus it more into the sun to get the most power.

However, this seems to be more about making a statement than the actual cost. If that's the case, go for it! I'd do the same except I'm hoping to manage without having a car at all.    EDIT: I just looked at the website and it does indeed look like it just powers a fan to cool the car. It's kind of neat and could be nice on really hot days when your car has been sitting in the sun for too long. Other than that, it doesn't seem that great. What would be cool is if it heated the car on cold days so that people didn't need to idle while waiting to pick up kids from school, etc.

1oxBCtmZaa	Depends on your starting point.    According to HadCRUT, the warmest year, globally, out of the last 120 was 1998.    The next warmest was 2005.     But for 2005 the trend is flat since 2000.    Since 2005, it has cooled, moderately but progressively: each year has been cooler than the last.    Going into December, 2008 was on track to be 10th or 11th warmest and somehow despite what we all experienced in December it ended up 9th - go figure.|`|vfubWXFMaa	The core problem is that the major data source being used to support the entire AGW and CC pogrom is based solely on conjecture and the Mann/Hansen hockey stick chart linked below as original. Now this was reviewed by a large group of climate professionals who instantly spotted a weird deviance from their own data streams in it and went back and recalculated all the US data since 1988 and found a +.5c discrepancy in the data.    After through checking they presented this evidence to NASA and NASA forced Hansen to issue a corrected graph. He did but labeled it USA only as the linked chart shows instead of replacing the world chart with this one as he should have. And this defective original graph still being updated by the defective computer program that automatically adds a +.5c correction to all data entries continues to provide evidence of warming that just is not happening.|`|NjjzRMBRaa	This is the correct answer to your question: "Is Al Gore just doing it for personal gain (fame, fortune, remain in the spotlight).

Along with the deforestation that runs rampid over the world, taking away from our co2 eating plants!  I just wish everyone would clean up after themselves and be responsible for this beautiful planet we live on.|`|KzuF9D4maa	If Gore is sincere then I'm the queen of England!      The problem that I have with him is that he doesn't practice what he preaches.  He expects the rest of us to reduce our "carbon footprint" while he does what he pleases.      Generally people have been calling it "global warming" because the average temperature of the planet has risen by several degrees in the past hundred years.  Translating roughly to local changes, that means it has drastically warmed at the poles and warmed very little in the tropics.  Global warming is exactly what is says, a warming of the globe on the average.  The media hype has often allowed people to forget that global warming is global not local, and an average over the whole planet.  So yeah, the last couple winters were pretty bitter, but who's to say that it wasn't a really warm winter elsewhere?  Don't worry though I wouldn't worry so much about global warming.  Say climate change then I would be more concerned.    Truly, Earth's climate has changed many times in the past without concern for the influence of humans.  The real question, as it should be is "is climate change happening more rapidly/violently because of human influence?" The study of climate has historically focused on the average values, like with temperature and precipitation.  However, at the 89th American Meteorological Society Meeting, it was plain the focus should be more on the extremes, because if the averages are changing the extremes must be changing as well.  Several of the talks I went to at the meeting, showed that the variability in the extreme values, like heat waves and cold snaps, has become larger in the past few years then ever before, with warmer hot periods but cold periods that were about the same.  So I wouldn't worry so much about the mean change, at least not just yet, worry about the extremes, like warmer heat waves, some more cold snaps, some more storm outbreaks in tornado season and the like.      Oh and one more thing, be skeptical of what you hear in the media, particularly anything from the mouth of Al Gore.  Odds are, they haven't really checked all the figures they should check, and they are just hoping you don't notice that.  Be skeptical, ask questions, be open-minded and decide for yourself.    Good question though, you provided me more proof that what I'm researching needs to be done.  After all there really needs to be some way to show what the global changes really mean to all the locals.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	After 8 years of control by George Bush this is what the US EPA has to say.    "According to NOAA and NASA data, the Earth's average surface temperature has increased by about 1.2 to 1.4oF in the last 100 years. The eight warmest years on record (since 1850) have all occurred since 1998, with the warmest year being 2005. Most of the warming in recent decades is very likely the result of human activities. Other aspects of the climate are also changing such as rainfall patterns, snow and ice cover, and sea level."    "If greenhouse gases continue to increase, climate models predict that the average temperature at the Earth's surface could increase from 3.2 to 7.2oF above 1990 levels by the end of this century. Scientists are certain that human activities are changing the composition of the atmosphere, and that increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases will change the planet's climate. But they are not sure by how much it will change, at what rate it will change, or what the exact effects will be."    To answer your question, I guess I believe the US EPA before I believe the Weather Channel.|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	Gore is hard for me to figure out.  He seems to be sincere to me.

Earth's climate has changed naturally time and time again since Earth was formed, regardless of human influence.  However, climate change in recent years is possibly being accelerated by human influence from the past few decades.      I hadn't heard that NASA was going to get that much for climate change research until recently, but there is a viable reason why that I can think of.  A large part of the data used for global atmospheric research comes from satellites that NASA puts up in space and maintains for multiple agencies such as the National Weather Service, National Hurricane Center, National Climate Data Center and more.  The larger the satellite the more money it costs to produce, launch, monitor and maintain.  So I'm guessing it wants the money primarily to keep the satellites functioning, which I personally am fine with.
