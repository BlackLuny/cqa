Also make sure it covers everything unless you have a perfect model body. :)|`|2UvVIRjNaa	I agree with the second person and like the way she said it lol. Still, the creases do not necessarily mean you have to go up one size. I have the same problem with some tops: if the top fits around the bust, some can bell out at the waist and I hate that look even more!<br>  <br>  I suppose you may have noticed by now that smaller chested women can wear clingy tops and no one says a word but when a more curvy woman wears the same top (in her own size), she usually gets looks that are more provocative.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, you may want to try tops that flatter your proportions yet are still clingy. Tops with a shirttail hem tend to be more fitted, V-neck tops, tops with side ruching and try to avoid wearing too many tops with three quarter sleeves. Further, be sure cotton tops have a tad of lycra in them.<br>  <br>  Another tip: the next time you are in a department store (Nordstrom, etc.) go to the lingerie department and get fitted for a bra. You will not be pressured in to buying one and chances are you will likely discover you are wearing the wrong sized bra. Most American bras do not have enough volume in the cup so women tend to make up for this by a larger band.?|`|4A3nlV3Baa	posting pics well help ;)

1gXo8oHtaa	Ok, It mainly depends on your hair and eye color, but since you have hazel eyes and brown hair it would be a light blue, light pink, black but not for color black usually makes eyes look longer(black works with any color of hair), if you want it to blend in more try brown, khaki, tan. I have blonde hair and blue eyes and I use pink, purple, green, natural colors, black, and sometimes blue but that depends on what shade. If you have red hair I would use black, blue, natural, and maybe purple. If you have black hair almost any color works except black, red, and since you have hazel eyes avoid greens.

kXTYqfXcaa	If it looks good with both, and your hair holds curl well, then go with curls. If you straighten it, of course there's the chance of the weather ruining it, which would really ruin your mood, most likely :) Curl it and do something special with it though, like add in a new clip or accessory, or put it in a different style. You may want to add some hairspray or something to ensure nothing can get at the curls.<br>  <br>  The top is super pretty - it's gorgeous :) Just make sure that nothing can get in the way, be yourself and don't try to be perfect- after all, he likes you for you - and everything should go well.<br>  Good luck *thumbs up*|`|0CuK7qL0aa	well... all i can tell is this trick<br>  before getting ready for the date :<br>  1.be calm<br>  2.go to a place which gives u peace of mind<br>  . close ur eyes<br>  4. imagine itself in curly hair and with straight hair<br>  5.ask ur self what u like<br>  6.listen ur mind will give u the answer<br>  <br>  <br>  this trick really does help me when im unable to decide anything<br>  <br>  but anyways seeing that u have naturally wavy hair go for curls<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|Wehx6UPIaa	straight is always nice, but so it curly i would probably straighten my hair but whatever you choose doing just be yourself =)|`|6G47mC9Taa	Curly makes the guy look at your more in a attractive way believe me when i went to my prom 1 year ago i curled my hair all eyes were on me lol guys obvs lol|`|AA11521623	Wear a big smile|`|Twq7efhQaa	There are many types of curls that you can do.  so it doesnt have to look exactly the same as the last time.

FaaMOcFCaa	you could try not completely rinsing out your conditioner, or when you do put in leave in conditioner in try putting like a shower cap on your hair and leave it in for about 20 minutes, then wash it out. it should be really soft. you could also try sleeping with a satin pillowcase. it helps prevent breakage in your hair that cotton pillocases cause. <br>  you could also try some at-home hair masks that are made from home ingredients. you can find lots of recipes online. <br>  <br>  i would say stop shampooing twice, because you could be stripping your hair of its natural oils, which help to make it soft and shiny and healthy. and leave the conditioner in for a little while. and make sure when you put the conditioner in to really get it all throughout your hair. smuch and scrunch it around so it gets to all your hair. as for the combing, i dont know what difference combing in the shower would make, but when you get out of the shower use a wide tooth comb or a pick to comb your hair, because it causes less breakage.<br>  man, that a lot lol<br>  hope i helped :)|`|iJbslaQNaa	all i know that EGG PROTEIN SHAMPOO helps make your hair soft. so you can try using that shampoo. like SUNSILK the yellow one has it. it's good for rough hair.

You'll find that your makeup glides on and blends more easily. <br>  <br>  1. Keep your skin free of buildup by using a gentle cleanser in the morning and at night. When cleansing your face, do so gently in upward motion stokes - do not tug, pull or scrub too hard to prevent irritation.<br>  2. Freshen up your skin with a toner containing ingredients that suit your skin type.<br>  3. Indulge your skin and keep it hydrated with a moisturizer that is compatable with your skin type. Make sure your daytime moisturizer contains SPF to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays. <br>  4. Treat yourself to an at-home-facial 2 to 3 times a week. Use a mild cleanser, then exfoliate with a gentle scrub that contains exfoliants that are round and non-abrasive.<br>  5. Apply a facial mask after exfoliating. Rinse off thoroughly and get a good night's sleep! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  secret to a natural, flawless look<br>  <br>  1. Apply foundation to your cheeks, forehead, and chin using a foundation brush, sponge, or clean fingertips. Blend the foundation all the way to your natural hairline with long, light strokes.<br>  2. Continue blending over the jawline and onto your neck to achieve a natural, seamless look. Check your face and neck in natural light to make sure the foundation is completely blended in all areas.<br>  3. If under-eye circles or red spots remain, do not add more foundation; it can look heavy and cakey. Instead, try a concealer. <br>  <br>   Tip: Choose the shade of your foundation carefully. When testing out shades, pick one that matches the tone of your jawline exactly. It helps to use a mirror outdoors to see how shades look in natural light. <br>  <br>   Tip: Begin by applying a small amount of foundation then increase amount to achieve the degree of coverage that suits your skin. <br>  <br>   Tip: For daytime, mix your foundation with a light SPF moisturizer before applying for a smoother, more sheer application. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hide imperfections <br>  <br>  Concealer is more dense than foundation, allowing fuller coverage of trouble spots and hyperpigmentation (red areas). It can be used over foundation or on it own, and has greater staying power. Remember, a little goes a long way! <br>  <br>  1. Since the skin under your eyes is more transparent, it tends to look dark, especially at the inner corner near the bridge of the nose. To even out the tone, concealer is a must. Using liquid concealer, gently pat over dark under-eye circles (don't sweep it across the entire area), then blend with your ring finger.<br>  2. To cover trouble spots and imperfections, apply a thicker cream concealer onto the blemish or flaw. Then lightly press with a makeup sponge. <br>  <br>   Tip: Choose the shade of your concealer carefully. When testing out shades, pick one that matches your skin tone or one shade lighter. It helps to use a mirror outdoors to see how shades look on your skin in natural light.<br>  <br>   Tip: Prepare your skin with a light SPF moisturizer before applying concealer for a smoother application. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  getting an all-day flawless finish<br>  <br>  A light even dusting of loose powder sets foundation and concealer, giving your face a velvety, more natural finish. It also provides smooth blending for any eye makeup or blush to follow. <br>  <br>  1. Dip a puff or powder brush in loose powder. Shake off excess to avoid uneven distribution, then apply powder over entire face and neck.<br>  2. To maintain a flawless finish throughout the day, apply pressed powder using a sponge or clean powder brush. <br>  <br>   Tip: Face powder can be used alone, over foundation or over your moisturizer for a natural, sheer, no-shine look. <br>  <br>   Tip: For the closest color match, choose a powder shade that is 3 shades lighter than your foundation. <br>  <br>   Tip: If you are over the age of 30, avoid powdering under the eyes as it can make fine lines and wrinkles appear more obvious. <br>  <br>   Tip: Facial oil-blotting sheets help to remove excess oil and shine without disturbing your makeup. Carry them with you everywhere you go!|`|0cJjyogqaa	because this is "school" even, i think natural look match whit you.... ^_^|`|7618x2okaa	Put Vaseline on your eyelashes, it makes them longer, even though it sounds weird it works!!!|`|HH0rjr7Saa	here look at this vid. this might help, just know that because you will be on stage you will have to do the makeup a bit more exagerated then what you're use to since the audience in teh back wont' see you.

tsn34pS4aa	assuming you are going to go to a professional, these are all reputable questions to ask them.<br>  <br>  most of the answers depend on the anatomy and shape of your nose, how hard you sneeze, how high your nostrils are and such, your best bet would actually be to just go to your local piercing shop and just have a consultation with the piercer, they will then be able to look at your nose and tell you how visible it would be in these situations.<br>  <br>  healing times, same with any piercing, 6-8 weeks with correct aftercare, but i will let you know that if you intend on wearing it down then flipped up while around your mom, it will take much much longer to heal as the constant movement will create inflammation and lengthen the time the fistula has to heal.<br>  <br>  there are some places that will pierce with a retainer, which is often a piece of silver metal but shaped in a way that when flipped up, curves in so as to almost hug your septum so it does not flip down as easy. if you do get it pierced, it is suggested that you keep the jewelry, either retainer or curved barbell bent so it can be flipped up,  in one position during the duration of the healing process so that it does not move unnecessarily and heals quickly. <br>  <br>  tips: go to a professional. every nose has a "sweet spot" which is where piercers put a septum piercing, assuming yours is in a good spot, it should not hurt much as it is not cartilage but skin like that of the earlobe, but thinner.|`|7tRTZhnLaa	First off you can't just get it pierced higher because there is a certain place were they need to pierce it at. And how are you going to get it pierced if she says no? Are you planing on doing it yourself? Because if you are don't it's too hard of a piercing to do. If you do get it pierced it's not hard at all to hide unless she is going to be looking up your nose. I've never had mine get all "gross" but if I have a cold or something I don't put it up... otherwise it might.

Melanin is produced in the hair bulb and when it does not produce melanin it causes the hair to grow out gray. It can be hereditary, or it can come from many other factors. Don't think that gray hair is a sign of aging, it's actually not; your hair is just missing color pigments that is produced by melanin. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps...<br>  <br>  Note: There are seniors who have not had one gray hair; so you don't have to be old to have a gray hair.<br>  <br>  the only thing that you can do it to dye your hair... dont keep pulling them out !!|`|0CuK7qL0aa	r u kinda suffering from either sinusitis or cold almost through out the year....?<br>  if yes then this could be the reason ...too much of cold (as in mucus in ur nose)is a cause of grays<br>  <br>  well get treated for ur cold<br>  and if not that then there is an indian herb called amla....its really good for u<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped  :)|`|68PRp0BGaa	Don't worry I get them too.

I had the same natural colour as yours too although it's getting duller as I am older now - they called in honey blonde.  I don't believe your face is long at all, I would say oval, but a bit longer than shoulder length would be very suitable in my opinion.  I don't have any photos to show but perhaps have it feathered at the sides, and possibly a feathered fringe and that should enhance your features.  It is hard to have your hair cut shorter when it has been long for quite some time I know, but just longer than shoulder length is not too extreme.

yCetTBp4aa	I wouldn't agree with some of these other people. You don't have curly hair. You would have noticed if you had curly hair by now or at least your parents would have noticed(when you were a baby and they had to wash your hair, they would have seen that it's straight). I'm sure you have straight and poofy hair like me. Don't listen to NM's suggestion. It's completely wrong. Whatever you do, DON'T AIR DRY!!!! That will make it poof us 4 times as much. How do I know? My hair's exactly like your's. So here's what to to:<br>  <br>  1. Get a smoothing shampoo&conditioner. I would recommend Aveda Smooth Infusion or Matrix Sleek Look. Aveda's the more expensive one but I use it and it is soooo great. It makes you hair look like never before and it has the best lemon citrus smell. Matrix Sleek Look is the next best shampoo but Aveda's is better. <br>  2. Get the Volume Diffuser from the John Frieda Collection. I have it and put it on right before hair drying. It get rids of the pooffiness. They sell it at Rite-Aid or any other drugstore. <br>  3. Get a really good hair dryer. The ones from the drugstore just won't cut it. They make your hair poofier than you hair needs to be. I have switched to the Sedu Proffesional Hair Dryer. I got it on folica.com.<br>  This is the main part to making your hair unpoofy. First you have to put the concentrator nozzles that come with it onto the hair dryer. Then, you have to blow dry your hair with a paddle brush and keep the hair dryer close to your head so when the hair dries, it will be kept in a position near the head and not away from the head. <br>  4. If you can afford it, before hair drying, use Aveda Style Prep Smoother. It makes your hair 100 times better. The Syle Prep Smoother protects from heat, protects from humidity, keeps you hair shiny, keeps your hair moisturized, get's rid of frizz(since you don't have much frizz this doesn't apply to you but i'm just saying), and overeall, it makes your look like a movie star's. And after your hair's dry, use Aveda Light Elements Smoothing Fluid. My stylist told me all these tips so they will work. And she did all this on my hair and it looked awesome!<br>  <br>  I do all these steps and my hair pooffiness decreases a LOT. Just don't air dry it. It will poof up so bad you will regret it. Good Luck!|`|DfDss68haa	First answerer is correct. You have curly hair and don't realize it. I have known some people who didn't know until college that they were curlies, they just thought they had straight hair that was poofy. So they kept brushing it, hoping it would "lie down". And that's the exact opposite of what you should with curly hair. Right now you are brushing out your curl pattern. Get the book Curly Girl by Lorraine Massey, it explains everything about the CG Method but I will outline it below. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Curly-Girl-Lorraine-Massey/dp/0761123008.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Curly-Girl-Lorrain...</a><br>  <br>  CG METHOD:<br>  1. No brushing<br>  2. Only comb hair with a wide tooth comb with conditioner in it.<br>  3. Do not wash every day. Opinion differs but it can anywhere from every other day to once every two weeks. Curly hair is easily dried out and needs natural oils to help curls clump. Focus on scalp when you do wash. Hair gets clean from run off.<br>  4. Eliminate silicones from hair products like shampoos and conditioner and styling products, they build up in curly hair causing frizz and the need harsh shampoos with sulfates to get rid of them which can dry out your hair causing frizz. It's a vicious cycle.<br>  5. Curly hair eats up moisture. Deep treatments every two weeks, condition every time you shampoo or even co wash (wash hair with condish) and have a leave in condish every day. <br>  6. Twist/braids at night to avoid tangling. <br>  7. Apply gel after washing hair or a humectant, This prevents frizz.<br>  8. Plop hair with an micro fiber towel rather than terry cloth.<br>  8. Touch hair very little throughout the day.<br>  <br>  PROOF:<br>  1.<a href="http://naturallycurly.com" rel="nofollow">http://naturallycurly.com</a><br>  2 Curltalk section<br>  3 the general discussion about curly hair forum<br>  4 the before and after CG method thread w/ pics<br>  AMAZING RESULTS!!!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck ?|`|FBGMKdqKaa	I would try Tanya's suggestion, but leave out the blowdryer - let your hair air dry. If it's still too poofy after applying leave-in conditioner and air-drying, then consider using either a flat or curling iron to "sculpt" it. <br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|E3Zqh0ZWaa	well, my friends hair used to b really poofy. like really alot. but it turned out that it was just really curly, and if u brush curly hair, it poofs. a lot. so try not brushing it. use curling gel, and get the book Curly Girl. its really good and tells u all u need to know. im serious about that book. also, dont use shampoo, just conditioner. shampoo is bad for curls. good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|cfykdmJ9aa	Just wash your hair with a conditioner. <br>  follow up with a leave in conditioner and blow dry. <br>  . . . that should do it.

Be aware that just becuase it says 100% human hair doesn't mean it is. Most mix synthetic hair. You can tell by burning the tips or getting it wet. It shouldn't smell pasticky when burned and it should get wavy when wet.)<br>  <br>  1. The brand of hair is MOST important. When I would get weaves, whether or not it would still look good by 2 months (not stiff, etc) depended on the brand I got. I wish I could give you specific brands but I've forgotten. :) Just trial and error I guess. One curly weave I got could have been reused after 3 months and others pooped out after a few weeks and looked like I had a dead cat on my head. Get your hair from a reputable hair shop and don't go cheap. <br>  <br>  2. The texture of the weave is important too. Whether you get straight, wavy, curly or kinky weave will change how you treat it. Generally for curlier textures I find you need to put some mousse in regularly. Products in general are good for weaves to weigh them down and hold the style. I mostly got straight weaves becuase curlier ones tangled easier and they frizzed quicker and after that there was no way to renew them. But remember: brand of hair is more important than texture. The best one I ever had was a curly weave. It was gorgeous even after 3 long months of travel, swimming in the Bahamas and amusement parks. I was visiting a friend so I didn't even take care of it. Amazing!<br>  <br>  3. If it's good (human) hair you should be able to apply heat to it, so when it starts getting skanky looking straighten it/roll it/use curling iron depending on the look you are going for. <br>  <br>  4. Shampooing it. I would make the mistake of not taking care of my hair underneath. Not good. Stinky and moldy. If you swim, go in the rain, or shower MAKE SURE your hair is dry as well. May need a blow dryer to get to the roots becuase cornrows can take days to dry on their own and you don't want to sleep on wet hair. Also moisturize your scalp. An easier way is dry shampoo or go back the salon for a wash. But my advice? Avoid washing on your own. Perfect way to get tangles and never go to sleep on wet weave for another reason. I once had to cut a knot out of my weave that way. Once weave locks there's no way that tangle is coming out. <br>  <br>  5. Once the weave starts moving around on your head the jig is up. lol To avoid an early removal make sure your hair stylist is sewing in as tight as possible. It might hurt for a little bit but the style will hold longer. This doesn't mean you braid tight, just sew in tight. Tight braids are bad.<br>  <br>  6. Once it's down to the wire and you want to get one more day out of a weave you cut it. I found this out after about 10 weaves. lol I never even thought to cut the weave. But you can and making a long 14" weave into a cute bob is great way to renew it. Also brushing is key and detangling every day. And wrap hair at night rather than sleep loose and sleep in satin cap.<br>  <br>  7. I've never gotten a kinky weave becuase I just assumed the tangles would have been horrendous. But you should try it. The texture is probably much more forgiving than straighter weaves that begin to show their age quite quickly but just be prepared for constant detangling. Plus if the hair is good quality you can always straighten it for a different look.<br>  <br>  8. The way your weave is put in is important as well. I don't know if you are doing sew ins but whatever the method, I recommend a style that can show a part. Weaves with no parts look really bad and fake. <br>  This?<br>  <a href="http://concreteloop.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/hh.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://concreteloop.com/wp-content/uploa...</a><br>  Or this?<br>  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Cvo4jwbe8wE/SSz5PJEMqAI/AAAAAAAABvI/BOi0idUxKVU/s400/halle_berry_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Cvo4jwbe8wE/SS...</a><br>  For parts you leave a little of her hair out to cover the tracks. Nothing gives a weave away quicker than tracks showing. Also make sure if you are getting a straight weave your own hair is short. Straight weave shows bumps more than a curlier weave.<br>  <br>  9. Also try cornrows in the front and a curly weave in the back. Partial weaves are an easier style to maintain, lasts longer, no tracks showing, gives scalp some exposure, and you use less hair. <br>  Kina like this: <br>  <a href="http://www.maasaibraids.com/images/gallery/micro_cornrows_braids.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.maasaibraids.com/images/galle...</a><br>  <br>  10. And finally I know what it's like to have a weave look and feel like a bird's nest. Toward the end hats, scarves, hair pins, bands, etc are your FRIEND! If it looks so bad that you just want it gone, Do it. Don't keep a fugly weave in. One of the best things I ever did was remove a weave myself becuase I think it was starting to meow.|`|H86wyEfmaa	ew dont sew it in|`|dYwkevD2aa	why *****??? you dont need it!!!! lol

If you want it to look more bulgy then take the bangs and when you pull them back, push them forwards a little before you clip them to your head. This will make it more bulgy(although personally it just looks like you have a ball under your hair when people do that & it looks kinda funny but whatever) And yes it is fine for round-faced girls, because kelly clarkson has a round face and it looks good in the picture that u have there so yes.

They have an ingredient in them called Bismuth Oxychloride which has a very high allergy rating. It can cause itching, rash, and in some cases acne. I used them in the past and couldn't figure out why my face itched every time I sweat. I have switched to Faerie Organic Minerals and they are soooo much better trust me. They are light, airy, cover amazing and leave a dewy glow. It looks completley natural and has natural SPF. They have a free sample kit too so you can try it out first. <a href="http://www.faerieorganic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.faerieorganic.com</a>|`|SWayW1ZRaa	I absolutely love bare minerals!  It gives maximum coverage but feels like you arent wearing anything at all.  My skin doesnt break out or anything.  I highly recommend it to everyone that comes into my salon!|`|UcgWrGaAaa	Yes.  But bare minerals is a bit expensive.  I use a physicians formula brand that is the same thing but only costs $10.  It works like a charm.

zlXofrG4aa	Dyeing your hair black is a death sentence for your hair if you ever want to go lighter.  I know from experience and from lots of friends who have done this.  After however many months you finally decide to go lighter again you'll have to bleach it, because dyeing is putting a pigment into hair, and bleaching is taking it out.  After bleaching the dyed black part it will be a splotchy orange/tan/yellow mess.  And your roots will be blonde! because it has no dye in it.  Your hair will be damaged and you'll need to restore it with protein packs, hot oil treatments, deep conditioning etc but it will still be somewhat damaged.  Then you'll have to bleach again if you want it to be lighter than what the blotchy mess already is.  Think of dyeing hair as colouring with markers.  If you have an orange colour how well it a light brown marker going to cover that?  Not too well.  If you have to bleach again you'll have to go through the whole process again of getting it healthy again so you can dye it light brown.  All in all I wouldn't do it unless you want to keep the black hair for a year or two.|`|GgNzFbAFaa	Ok story time =) <br>  I dyed my hair black three years ago and for my 15th birthday i wanted to go blonde. It took three days to bleach it blonde (not kidding i had to go back to the salon every day for three days.) And it was painful. It makes your hair really dry after you bleach it or try to make it lighter again and its very hard to streighten it without burning. It feels rough (no matter how much conditioner you use) and it might look a little wierd. My hair went from black to dark red to traffic cone orange to yellow to blonde. It will be hard getting the right color. It's a lot of work. And alot of money. =(|`|YIWAefzUaa	If you want to go jet black, you will have to let your hair grow out, but if you go to like a lighter black, because they do have different shades, then if you try a color with the word ash in it, then it should dye your hair lighter, but it may take a few tries|`|mbw2JL9gaa	my hairs black and i have had it stripped twice at a salon n once at home and the colour wont come out i have tried re-dying it and it wont work so if u r unsure of goin black i wood gt a wash out dye to try it|`|yV5flOZPaa	NOOOOOOOOOOO!<br>  please don't do it lol<br>  i did that a few months ago and i hated it!!!!<br>  omg i cried for weekssss<br>  and i could not get it out<br>  i looked all pale and gothic and ahhhh<br>  please hun don't do ittttt!<br>  stick to the light colors<br>  trust me<3|`|qYgXwYXNaa	i think that is a really gd idea, i did that and my hair turned out fabulous, it went from brown 2 blak and now its really light light brown|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I wouldn't do it. First, it could dry out your hair really bad, and second, you will have to dye it multiple times to get it light again.|`|bVr6wvcWaa	your gonna mess up your hair :)|`|78d6ef8ee0f77ed0f7f9850021641ce6aa	i dyed my hair black 2 or 3 years ago and it's almost gone. i loved how it looked, but black is a color you have to commit to for a while depending on the length of your hair. i tried to dye it a lighter color and nothing worked. i was stuck with black hair for a long time especially because my hair is long. i was told i had to bleach my hair. i prefered to let it grow out because i didn't need more damage to my hair.<br>  <br>  your hairs texture will not change but black will stay black. even if you want to dye it from black to dark brown. nothing stays.|`|TYx7b1zvaa	You can... You can go black.. But once your black.. It will take awhile to lighten up. If before the black comes out you decide that youdont like it or you are tired of it.. You can strip your hair of all color (Can be done at home also) and then put the new color in your hair.. Your hair will not fall out after just a few dyes..|`|FC2Kdo29aa	dye it black, make sure you wait until your roots are unbearable (and take care of your hair, wash it regularly etc)<br>  <br>  and then i would get it bleached at a salon or get one of your friends to do it once you want to dye it light again.|`|pEpet2ioaa	why dont you go to the salon? then its done properly<br>  <br>  but if you cant like afford it or somethin .... id not die it but thats my oown opinion, you could ASK a hairdresser for advise would be a good option :)|`|t0sjtkjAaa	your going to fry your hair out<br>  <br>  any professional will tell you not to ever<br>  go two shades darker than your natural hair<br>  color.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225070000AAq3jO9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|VTF3urxZaa	it can be done..<br>  but it takes at least a year or your hair will end up like straw|`|LEoo3vBxaa	NO NO NO!! Don′t do it!!<br>  <br>  I died my hair dark brown myself and the color was nice, the thing is the color you by in the store is much more aggressive then when you go to a salon.<br>  <br>  If you try to die your hair lighter then the color you already have it will become orange but the roots will be very light....<br>  <br>  it′s awful! I have a lot of bad hair experiences and when I died my hair myself it took along time to get back the light color and I had to go to the salon maybe 5-6 times before I was blond again. <br>  <br>  It takes less time if you go to a salon I think because the colors are different.<br>  <br>  But if you decide to do this - please don′t try to die it blond again. I have already made that mistake and my hair started to fall off in piles.<br>  <br>  Good luck ;)|`|MT0gw2hmaa	Once you go black, you won't come back. Its almost impossible to lighten dyed black hair at home. If you dye your hair black and then later decide you want to lighten again, your gonna have to wait until your hair grows out to get it healthy. It is possible but your gonna end up with very processed hair and the color will never get just right until it grows out. Summer is coming up and most people want highlights and go a little lighter in summer, so think about it. Don't get me wrong black hair is gorgeous on the right complexion.|`|GmghrL4Iaa	OMG. okay i can tell you all about the mistakes ive made for dying my hair black. i got it professionally done at a salon while my hair was still a little bit short. and im the type of person who needs to keep changing her hair whether it be short or color or whatever. so before dying my hair i ddnt know that i had to bleach it , if i wanted to change it back to whatever color i wanted coz you cant just dye black hair ( for exmaple back to brown or whatever) <br>  so after a few months my hair started to grow and my roots started to show and its been so ugly ever since because my natural hair is like brown and whenever i wear my hair down or straighten it you can totally see the part where its been dyed and the natural hair color.<br>  ive really regretted dying my hair black in the first place ITS SUCH  A HASSLE ! bleaching my hair would KILL IT. and i wont do it. so for now i really duno what to do with it<br>  <br>  anyway i hope you dont make the same mistake i did! take care<br>  x|`|of049X1waa	If you use a temporary dye, yes.  Also, if the second time you dye it, you go to a salon... Try to find one of those semi-permanent dyes to make it black, it will still last a while but not too long and you can re-dye it, or go light again.  If you use permanent the first time, then go to a salon the second time.|`|p0WEjAwdaa	that will mess up your hair... honestly, my friends who have done that have hair like Velcro now... and thats their words, not mine<br>  <br>  one of my friends hair actually MELTED when she bleached it back from being black.<br>  thats because it takes SO SO much bleaching to get black dye out.|`|28qmqsySaa	your going to ruin your hair adn it may start to fall out <br>  and you will have to let it grow all out again<br>  if you did this you should wait a long time before you re-do it<br>  to be on the safe side<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  smile|`|8d87fe8a8d0a0fb67336e3e06085d424aa	I don't like that your not going to a salon. but if you refuse...I think that if you died your hair black and then wanted a lighter color it'll work. but it might not come out to be the color you wanted.
UYnZtJ2daa	I have one and I really like it. It's been there for almost two years and still looks very white but there are two things that play into that. First, I'm very pale...so white shows up a lot better on my skin than most people. Second, it's on my ribs so unless I am out at the beach or pool, it's not exposed to the sun. <br>  <br>  The bad thing about white tattoos is that they can fade really fast and they don't always show up purely white. It's why a lot of artists won't do completely white tattoos. I think the only reason mine did was because I am so pale and because he knew me. The good thing is that if it doesn't turn out purely white or how you want it to look, it's easy to cover it with a different color.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	i like them, but my friend says that she has to get hers touched up a lot because the white fades super fast|`|kCdISEGqaa	White tattoos are completely different than UV tattoos if that is what you are asking.  I noticed someone said their's glows under blacklight.  They have to be a special ink to show under blacklight.  Just because it's white ink, doesn't mean it will glow.  A lot of the white ink in my tattoos has turned an off-white/yellowish color, but, in my tattoos, it still works.  Best wishes!!!|`|MV0lMuDMaa	I have a flower as part of one of my tattoos and I wanted it white but the tattoo artist said that color will fade very fast and advised me to do something else.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	I have one on my wrist.  It looks kind of like a faint scar and I love it.<br>  <br>  Don't expect it to be bright white, though.  It won't be unless you get it touched up every few months.|`|klu1sCpraa	Two of mine have white in them and they tend to fade And need to be retouched every now and then|`|ZkrGttKaaa	I've got one, and have put on several, and white ink tattoos usually require a couple of sittings, minimum, to get the skin to hold the pigment well. They require fairly frequent maintenance sittings, as well. They tend to look off-white or yellowish in a few years time, if not maintained. But, they're popular right now, primarily because of an article in a popular magazine. But they ARE a hassle.|`|f2cbdf6e29f9f4bf30122b5b11a4cdabaa	sure do hun, have a few tribal white ink tatts, people come up to me at the clubs and are amazed, i also have a few black lights in my house, its wicked, i reckon its the best **** ive ever done|`|U7mP7Rw9aa	I have a tattoo and I got a little white in it and you can't really see it now. But some skins are different of the white some stays really well and some don't.
7yqqxOpiaa	I think you should just choose whichever style YOU like best, not what style you think you "should" wear. You can have both styles, if you like, baggy and fitted. So that way, on days you feel like wearing baggy clothes, you can wear 'em. And on days you feel like wearing fitted, you can wear 'em, too. I reckon a wardrobe's more fun with different styles and colours and stuff. Haha mine's like that, lol. (Some days when I feel like myself, I wear my usual band t-shirt and jeans. When I'm feeling girl-ish I wear something cutesy lol.

On the one hand, I don't feel that these parents should be pushing their daughters to grow up so fast. All that makeup, hair extensions, and fake teeth is disgusting and ridiculous. I don't believe that you should doll up young girls to look like 20-year-old women to win a beauty pageant. It's creepy. However, I have a cousin who loves cheering, gymnastics, and dance, and works very hard at succeeding in them. Her mother, in fact, coaches her cheering team and has taken the girls to win state championships. I can agree with that, because not only does my cousin love what she does, but her mom isn't shoving her face in it. I've watched a few shows on these pageants and you see the girls crying and wanting to go play. I don't think that's right. If these girls like being in pageants, let them do that. But there's no need to put in fake teeth, load them up with makeup, and doll their hair up. Let them be kids like they need to be.|`|lKn7nZfBaa	Extreme beauty pageants are mentally cruel to the psyche of the child.<br>  They often become depressed and detached when they do not "win".<br>  <br>  I think at a local level for fun without all of the makeup, it's ok.<br>  <br>  The first link reminded me of Jon benet and her goofy mother (former pageant winner.

6UWFGdy3aa	i saw the link. the one above the 9 is not in cartilage and doesnt hurt. and the one above the one above the 9 isnt cartilage either. i have these three and they didnt hurt and were quick to heal. Any piercing above the seven involves cartilage. i have the outer ear piercing as well. Carilage hurts a little more and takes about a month or two to heal. I pierced all of these myself and its really no big deal. good luck!|`|2eMDegaXaa	can't see the link either..<br>  <br>  Also common is cartilage piercing in the ear. Some have begun piercing the right upper corner of their ear cartilage for the same reason of solidarity. <br>  <br>  There is no widely known symbolism for piercings elsewhere in the ear cartilage. Most portions of the ear cartilage can be safely pierced by an experienced professional.|`|GBODLQNcaa	yes, that would involve cartilage pearcings ,i have 3 ear lobe piercings and 1 cartilage pearcing but it feels about the same the only difference  is that it takes the cartilage piercings longer to heal.|`|txuFMISJaa	I can't see the link either, sorry.  But if it's piercing on your ear it will most likely be piercing your cartilage.

n8VlnckAaa	1. Comb your dry hair, look at yourself in a mirror and decide what length your hair should be. (You may want to tie this to some physical landmark, such as chin-length, or down to your collarbone or whatever.) Note the length of the hair you want to take off.<br>     2. Assemble your equipment: A sharp set of scissors (if you don't have haircutting scissors, fabric scissors are excellent), a comb, shampoo and conditioner. You will also need to be in front of a mirror when you start cutting.<br>     3. Shampoo and condition your hair. Do not rinse out the conditioner--it makes it easier to comb your hair.<br>     4. Comb your hair, as straight as you can, and gather it at the very top of your head--the bit of your scalp that is uppermost when you stand up straight.<br>            * It may help to bend over while you do this.<br>            * Try to be precise about this--gather your hair in the middle of the top of your head, not too far forward or backward. Check your alignment in the mirror.<br>     5. Twist your gathered hair as tightly as you can into a spiral.<br>     6. Take your scissors and cut off the length of hair you noted in Step 1.<br>     7. Comb your hair again--straight up to the top of your head--and twist it again, as tightly as you can, in the opposite direction. Most of your hair should be of a uniform length from the top of your head (from the cut in the previous step) but take your scissors and snip off any stragglers.<br>     8. Rinse the conditioner out of your hair, dry it and style as usual.|`|34UHfffxaa	it depends on the type of hair you have if your hair is silky type then layer with suit and if curly then step cut|`|728vD8bYaa	take a look here; <a href="http://www.capelliperte.135.it" rel="nofollow">http://www.capelliperte.135.it</a> bye|`|HjOcyR52aa	i think layer cut|`|xTIvZwqJaa	Layer's the best!|`|FBGMKdqKaa	layers|`|Qd1fPDMgaa	Layers, It gives your hair bounce and volume..

Any heating tool you use is going to damage your hair. You should use a good heat protectant when you use your heating tools. Something else you should do is deep condition your hair once a week.

K70Hkq5haa	Let them grow out some. Meantime rub vasaline aka petroleum jelly over them. Every time you wash your hands, reapply and run your fingers over them as you would do in a massage. Do not use nail polish or anything on your nails until your nails are back to normal. I would also mention this to the M.D. as there may be other issues that may be causing the flaking of your nails. My doctor always checks my nails because I'm asthmatic and just by the color he can see If I'm getting enough oxygen. There are other reasons why doctors check nails which I don't really know of. I hope this was of some help. peace!|`|lU8e0VQFaa	I had mine taken off a while ago too. Some recommended me to do some warm milk soaks and I picked up this Sally Hanson treatment made for when you get acrylics taken off. It's this 2 phase thing, you do the first for a couple of weeks and then the second for a couple more. It was really helping til I got lazy and stopped doing it. It only takes a couple of minutes, you "paint" the stuff on give it a minute and then rub this oil in that's supposed to help them grow. It's nice also because it makes your nails look better so you're not trying to cover them up with anything. You'll also want to keep them short, like VERY short, otherwise they're just going to break and rip off anyway.|`|1430ca2d3d29baf8526ae34c2e2eaedeaa	I'm having the same exact problem.

If you cut him carefully then they should blend back into your long hair without anyone noticing them.
K2QwEM4raa	Yes but I myself would leave out the conditioner if your hair is oily or soft. Because it will make your hair soft and not hold the style as well. Hair spray will do the same thing. With damp spray lightly and scrunch or pin or clip up hair all over your head, let dry and finger comb it.|`|o1rzGR8kaa	My guard use club, then boot|`|28qmqsySaa	I say it is OK<br>  <br>  smile<br>  good luck|`|FZRZFusuaa	Absolutely - the cream (leave in conditioner) will help take down the fly aways - put this on first.

I use to use it all  the time when I was younger.
qQqC2cHIaa	No, but a noble woman of the era would use tweezers to pluck out all the hair that wasn't on the top of her head, including eyelashes, eyebrows, legs and -one would assume -down there.

ESAMvi4taa	Odds are it isn't dandruff?  Are the flakes white, or yellow/orange?  True dandruff will have exclusively yellow and orange flakes.  This is because the dandruff bacteria interact with the sebum in your hair.<br>  <br>  Dandruff is really not very common at all.  The makers of commerical "dandruff shampoos" (which are EXTREMELY drying to your hair and you should never ever use them) want us to think that the white flakes we see, which are actually signs of dry scalp and/or product buildup, are dandruff so that we will buy their shampoos.  However, since the problem is dry scalp, using the drying dandruff shampoos only makes things worse.<br>  <br>  The important thing to do is to make sure you're getting your scalp free of products without drying it out.  Use a shampoo without sulfates (sodium laurel sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, ammonium laurel sulfate, ammonium laureth sulfate) like Giovanni Tea Triple Treat (found at Target, Rite Aid, Kroger, or Whole Food) or something like Johnson's Baby Shampoo (nice and gentle).  This will take care of your product buildup and also help keep the natural oils that your scalp needs to prevent the flakes from being stripped away by harsh commercial shampoos.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	To keep dandruff away, take a tablespoon of lemon juice with 2 tablespoon of coconut oil, massage it well on scalp and hair regularly.Wash your hair with warm water.

acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	It depends on what kind of face shape you have. If you have a thinner face and want to make your face appear fuller, then you'd apply the blush to the apples of your cheek. (The fattest part) You'd probably want to put a bit of blush on the tip if your nose and the bottom of your chin. This gives the illusion of having a fuller face. However, if your face is fuller and you want it to appear thinner, suck your cheeks in (Make a fishy face) and apply the blush at the indent from the fish face you're making and bring it back all the way to the middle of your ear. Make sure you blend really well or it's just going to look like you have a line of pink on the side of your face. If you only want to apply blush just to give your face a natural glow, then you'd apply it to your face in a "3" motion. Start on your forehead go around the eyebrow and eye to the cheek and go out again to the jawline and come back to the chin. If you trace the motion, it ends up being a three. Do this on both sides of your face.|`|ndX8I6qCaa	I dont really use "blush", but I use bronzer like a blush kind of (so really I am prolly not the best person to answer.)  I dont know the best  place, but I put a darker bronze right under my cheek bones and brush it back away from my face, so it does not clog my pores, and then I use a lighter shimmeryish bronze on the top of my cheek bones (like right over top of them).  It accentuates my cheek bones, and I think it makes me look better! :)<br>  Good Luck!|`|fs1P0h7laa	First tip try not to put a lot on and make sure its your color.

2Dy6jZBtaa	well u should test for hormonal problems...nutrition can change ur hair as well as just life in general. u don't keep the same hair texture ur whole life. it actually changes quite a bit in a lifetime. if u don't wash enough , that can cause dryness and brittleness. again as i said nutrition has a play in how ur hair is doing...stress in general wont effect ur hair but the hormone change from the stress possibly can or the off balance nutrition due to stress can cause it. to me it sounds like every time u sweat or ur body heats up, ur noticing this change in hair. possibly it might be humidity from ur own body.  the patching of hair though says its a medical condition...there are a number of things that can cause what ur describing...oh and another thing, if ur taking n e medications, that can cause hair loss...possibly also something wrong with ur thyroids...oh and if u have some pretty good itching as well on ur scalp, u can have ring worms...again a bunch of things can be wrong...u just have ot narrow it down urself a bit, take it to a doctor, if they still don't listen, find another doc for a second even third opinion, because this is obviously something that isn't natural and healthy if ur loosing ur hair in patches and ur hair has thickened quite a bit and become brittle.|`|Twq7efhQaa	Heres some tips for dry scalps:<br>  You should always change your shampoo to the present condition of your hair. If you have healthy shiny hair, you need a light-shampoo, if you use colour you might try a color seal shampoo. Every shampoo lines carries moisturising shampoo in all shapes, sizes and prices. Season, activity heat intensity, products used after your blow dry can make your hair dry. It?s quite simple to fix. A good moisturizing conditioner will help also. <br>  <br>  Sometimes a hairspray or styling product may cause a little build up around the surface of your scalp. Look at the label and make sure your shampoo is a cleaning or cleating shampoo. Their purpose is to get rid of build-up and keep your hair clean allowing a conditioner to work. Sometimes if there?s too much build-up the conditioner you put at your scalp can?t reach down to the root where the root of the matter is. No pun intended. <br>  <br>  <br>  and heres some hair growth tips: <br>  omega 3 acids<br>  <br>  Fruit and vegetables<br>  <br>  Hair pills or supplements<br>  <br>  This is the biggest single action you can take to prevent baldness. You should take hair supplements if you are not sure you are getting the right vitamins in your diet, or the right proteins for your hair. Let me tell you right now this is probably one of the best hair growth tips I can give you.<br>  <br>  Massage<br>  <br>  Massaging your scalp on a daily basis will assist blood flow in your scalp and improve circulation. This will stimulate your hair to grow.<br>  <br>  Smoking<br>  <br>  Smoking is the single biggest way to damage your hair. Studies have shown smoking can restrict blood flow and circulation to your scalp and will damage your hair. Cut back on cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Alcohol<br>  <br>  Various tests and studies have shown alcohol to indirectly influence hair loss. Reduce alcohol consumption where you can|`|YdI1SSyKaa	The other answers sounded really helpful to me but i just wanted to add that you should use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner vs. a dandruff shampoo. Dandruff shampoos tend to further irritate the scalp and the chemicals dry out your hair more.

That's probably why you're having problems. I have one on the top of my foot and I went with sandals for a couple of weeks and it healed nicely. Neosporin is never a good idea. If you've been wearing shoes, it's probably going to be irritated because it needs to be able to breathe and they're irritating it. Go without shoes for a couple of days and see if it helps. No neosporin either. If you have others, you know what to use.|`|rjac15O0aa	It does not sound infected, but I would keep an eye on it.  Mos def you need to not wear shoes for a while.

This creates a barrier so that the fibers in the fabric don't wear & break. Let it dry completely before wearing & reapply every so often depending on how much you wear the pants.

However, with a sudden onset like this, that could be indication of something much more serious, such as a parasite, over-active thyroid, or unfortunately some type of disease (ie. liver) or cancer (ie. lymphoma). BUT you should also be aware that if you have been under a lot of stress lately, this can ALSO cause a sudden case of sweaty palms. <br>  <br>  My advice? Set up an appointment ASAP to see your family physician, as (regardless of what the cause - stress, parasite, other medical condition) they will be able to offer some sort of medicinal plan or therapy that can help you overcome it. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|UjxSuFAbaa	Well You could go to the doctor about it ?<br>  or try UM moisturizing or something<br>  <br>  :) x|`|cjMai5PGaa	Go see a doctor, my little brother has the same problem and takes a pill everyday to eliminate them.

111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	Hey, I'm not like the others!! Mine is cleaned out all the time. I try to be somewhat organized and clean out the gum wrappers once a month. I have very few items in my purse. Wallet, checkbook, lotion, keys and of course gum. That's it. Simple like me.|`|Gk4kNAWsaa	NOT A CHANCE!!<br>  <br>  actually, for a purse, i am using a black leather "rider's bag" that one would see slung across the back of someone riding a motorcycle. i like it because the long strap is real wide for my shoulders--love it--but best of all it is so big, so cavernous that it should hold everything; somehow, though, i am always finding something else that i need to stuff in there! i have my journals, my bible, my check book, wallet, the daily newspaper (the oregonian), my favorite 5 rocks (don't ask), chap stick, leather gloves, a menagerie of receipts, pens, my ipod, a digital recorder, and a bunch of stuff at the bottom that i haven't really been through in about 2 weeks. <br>  <br>  i tried to fit a spare change of clothes for my 3 year old when we went to a funeral last week and they BARELY fit in there, but i did get 'em in! i have a few other purses that are small and cute and fashionable, but i will use them for a week or so and then i have to upgrade and exchange them for a bigger model. crap. i swear i try!! but no matter how much i manage to keep it all in a smaller bag, it never lasts very long before i have to break down and get the rider's bag out. anyway, i'm not going to fight it anymore. there must be a reason for me to need all of this stuff AT ALL TIMES!<br>  <br>  thanks, good question...<br>  <br>  living with the shame of it all,<br>  rachelle|`|dxu8OU7qaa	of course.<br>  As long as there is room in the handbag then there will be more stuff cramed into it.|`|VYMOwgc3aa	Yep.<br>  <br>  The only things I keep in there are my phone, iTouch, ID & debit card, cash, & keys. <br>  <br>  <3|`|YDiIx0dHaa	if i can fit it,<br>  yes <br>  <br>  =)|`|g7gvzhkpaa	you say that till you want a mint or some gum ,you need some aspirin you love it .|`|8oHlIrLOaa	No(:<br>  Unless.. its a really hot guy!

xnxrpKAqaa	my advice to you would to be to go to a dermatologist. that way they can see what your skin is really like and perscribe you a cream or pill that targets your specific type of acne.<br>  dont waste time on scrubs, masks, and things like proactive. proactive doesnt do a thing. it just dries out your skin and makes you break out worse.<br>  <br>  ask about doxycycline. its a pill that you take twice a day, and it works wonders. i have blackheads to and that pill gets rid of them all.|`|95e73ac51a03a10b231745f9eee7724faa	heat shouldnt help, and there really isn't a "quick" way to get rid of them. You can try hiding them till they repair tho, and thats what some ppl do... quickest way that i know of tho is drinking LOT LOT LOTS of water everyday and using a good product like proactive.... or any product that has benzoyle peroxide or w/e that is about 3-6%.... and lastly, dont irritate your face, dont wash it too often or touch your hands with it and if you must touch then then do it as gently as possible.|`|TEeX06WWaa	i found this for you on your question|`|3LlW0uf5aa	I have the same problem! i know how you feel. i wish i had an answer for you|`|BRlWdRl9aa	apply curry leaves at night <br>  and in the day time apply a mixture of tomato juice, curd ,pinch of haldi and gram powder|`|rHKW1CJJaa	dab the spots with tea tree oil 2x a day to shrink them. its really drying so include some moisture in your routine so you dont throw off your skins ph|`|afAbSq5gaa	depending on how much of it and how bad it is, your doctor can prescibe an antibiotic pill that will clear it up!

Sorry! x|`|mMNlEIYxaa	A lot of people do jump to the conclusion that you are gay. It is just not the typical thing to have a guy wear women type underwear. And people will definitely think you are gay if you have women's jeans and a thong. This might not be what you want to hear, but it is right. Take my advice and give me best answer. Thanks.|`|A3d9lLi5aa	I wouldn't say you were gay, I might think it but I'd probably dismiss it easily. The thing is, it's not something women are into, so it's stereotyped as being gay because men prefer it more.

lBT7Tel2aa	Two weeks is not really enough time... whatever you do, don't do it yourself!<br>  <br>  If the piercer is willing to change your piercing with a retainer, then they will be able to get it done correctly without messing up the hole. You'll pretty much have to reset your "heal time" counter, though.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Yes you can change it but don't touch it much at school and keep it extra clean :)|`|H6rPxpHWaa	Here is all the info you need To Know:<br>  <br>  Lip piercing is about $50 and there is an additional consideration for preparation of this piercing. First the inside of the mouth is prepared and then the outside. There is extra preparation for the lip piercing. They are generally done from the inside of the mouth out and so the piercing artist has to be experienced. They mark the outside of the lip. They clamp the lip and then insert the piercing from the inside out. There are dangers to piercing your own lip. Without preparing the equipment mouth properly, infection could develop.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  If the piercing is going to be a Marilyn Monroe or Madonna style piercing, they have a little flat back on it that lies against the gum and then the decoration is on the outside. Because it is one of the trickier piercings, we charge $60 for that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You can tell if your lip piercing is infected because it is going to be swollen, puffy, and red and it is going to hurt. You will need to treat it by rinsing the inside of the mouth and then clean the outside properly with antibacterial ointment. If it is a stud on the piercing, you have to be very, very careful cleaning around it. If it is a ring, be sure and rotate the ring in and out. We don't have a high number of infections with lip piercings, but I have seen some.|`|4571a6e95ced00741357c93ef0ceb652aa	Its not safe to change your piercing until it has completely healed (6 to 8 weeks).  You CAN change it to a clear retainer, although you must make sure to purchase the same gauge or you will have it infected.  Make sure to wash your hands before you do it, and dry them off with a paper towel and not a regular towel, or that could spread bacteria.  If anything, just keep the ball off of a labret stud and make sure not to play with the stud with your tongue.  I've done that plenty of times and have had it fall off, where I've had to go to the bathroom and put it back in.  I have snake bites, and I have to wear retainers for work, but they are fine with me just leaving in the stud.  It is much safer for the piercer to do it, but I recommend that you do not change it out after 2 weeks because it can risk infection and it can give you a lot of scar tissue as well.|`|4hfHpUauaa	I think it would be safer to have the piercer do it for you.<br>  What kind of piercing do you want to get on your lip?

C0HZ8ZB4aa	There are some good places in Camden Town I hear, I know there are loads down the main street that I've seen but I'm not sure which are individually best. But you could look at them. Also a studio in the St Johns area called Into You I hear is very good. They have quite a lot of artists, one of which is Nikole Lowe who, if you ever watched London Ink, you'd know produces amazing work. This is their website - <a href="http://www.into-you.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.into-you.co.uk/</a> - I imagine all the artists there are of a high standard. Their shop minimum is ￡80 though which is what I imagine you'd pay but you'll have trouble finding a cheap yet good tattoo in London - body art is worth investing in right?

XDBPylOfaa	My nails used to be crappy but now they are really fantastic.  First of all kick any nail biting habits you have, buy some bitter tasting nail polish which you can get from most pharmacies (drugstores) and within a fortnight you should have stopped biting your nails, although it makes it difficult to eat stuff with your hands like sandwhiches. Play with a ball of putty or blutack to keep your hands busy so you don't pick at your nails or bite them.    Drink plenty of milk, whether its on your cereal or in tea as this stops white marks on your nails from lack of calcium. Try to avoid trimming your nails unless you break one until they are the desired length.  File your nails so they have straight rounded edges and aren't uneven.    Buy a finger nail brush so under your nails are clean and dirt free, first rub the brush bristles on a bar of soap then scrub under your nails, then soak the bristles in warm water and scrub again. If you have weak nails buy some strengthening nail polish, and to make them look really healthy I use clear nail polish because it makes them look nice and shiney.  You can also have a french manicure if you like them but I suggest you get it done at a manicurist or get a friend who is good at them to do it.|`|kdZcHLETaa	prenatal vitamins.

EJ1ZmHVaaa	check out this website   <br>  www.wikihow.com/Grow-Long-Hair-if-You-...<br>  here are some of their tips:<br>  Have an experienced hair care professional or stylist trim your split ends.(Please note, a "trim" or "dusting" removes between 1/8 to 1/4 inch of hair.) If you have badly split ends, an inch or two may need to be removed, but it is healthier for your hair in the long run. Remember, trim only for split ends-- otherwise have 1/8 inch trimmed every 8 to 12 weeks: hair grows just one half inch per month and if it is cut more frequently, you will not see any length, since it is being cut as often or more than it is growing. <br>  Wash hair as needed depending on your hair type and health. This could be every three days with products that do not contain alcohol or harsh sulfates and are pH balanced. Do not over-wash (once is usually enough), as over washing can cause a dry condition, which will ultimately lead to breakage. While washing, massage your scalp. This will reawaken sleeping follicles and promote thicker healthier hair. <br>  Use a regular moisturizing conditioner after every wash, but deep condition at least every week. One week use a moisturizing deep conditioner. The next use a protein or reconstructing conditioner. Doing so will make your hair healthy and strong. <br>  Use a daily moisturizer or leave-in conditioner as black hair is prone to dryness. Apply the moisturizer (without petroleum jelly, petrolatum or mineral oil) to the hair from roots to ends and gently massage in. Do this daily or as your hair requires--you want your hair to feel soft and pliable.You may have to experiment with what works for you but Ultra Black Hair Creme Moisturizer, Doctor Miracles, ORS Carrot Oil Cream or Dudley's PCA Moisture Retainer are good moisturizers to try. <br>  A light oil (olive, soybean)applied sparingly may be used on your hair after applying a water-based moisturizer in order to seal moisture into the hair shaft and give your hair a nice natural shine. These oils can also be used to relieve a dry scalp. <br>  Avoid using blow-dryers as much as possible when drying hair as the excessive heat causes dryness, damage and breakage. Air drying hair is the best method. If the volume of your hair is increased with air drying you can do one of two things: first: apply moisturizer,then air-dry-- this will decrease the volume without causing damage; or second - apply moisturizer and use a dome or bonnet dryer on a cool or warm setting. Never use the highest setting! <br>  To get your hair to grow long, you also need to comb it carefully. Be sure to use a wide-tooth comb with no seams and comb it gently from the ends first, as combing from the ends will detangle hair as you comb higher and higher. Never comb from the roots to the ends until your hair is completely untangled. <br>  Avoid daily and/or excessive brushing of your hair, as black hair is fragile. Excessive brushing can strip the hair of its protective layers. If you trying to smooth your hairline, brush gently, use a soft boar bristle brush, and make sure your hair is completely dry and moisturized. <br>  Make sure you also wrap your hair with a silk/satin head wrap or bonnet before you go to bed at night. Without this protection, your loose hair will move about as you sleep putting stress on your hair, drying it out, and causing split ends. <br>  Treat your hair from within by taking a multivitamin. Use a hair vitamin that will increase your hair growth rate and lenghthen your natural anagen (growth phase). Also drink at least eight cups of water and eat healthy foods such as fish, fruits, vegetables and nuts, and by exercising regularly to provide good circulation to the scalp. <br>  Relaxing - Now this is where all of your washing and conditioning treatments can either pay off or be sabotaged by damage. First of all, do not relax your hair more than once a month. Be careful not to relax hair “bone straight.” This robs the hair of its natural elasticity and causes it to break easily. Assess your hair before attempting to relax it. It may only need to be washed, moisturized, and straightened with a heat tool. If you must relax it, choose a mild relaxer or use a "press" creme supposedly it's organic and better than normal relaxers it only needs to be reapplied every 3 months and the hair won't break if you stop using it; ask your local hair dresser that deals with black hair about it. <br>  Applying the relaxer: It is best to have someone else apply the relaxer because they have a full view of your head. Before you begin, rub a generous amount of scalp protectant in your hands and apply to the entire hair shaft. Petroleum jelly can be used. Pay close attention to the ends of your hair when applying the protectant. This is to protect hair that has already been processed. Next, apply the relaxer using the manufacturer’s directions. Follow the timing chart so you do not over process your hair. Be sure to wash out all of the relaxer with warm water. Apply a neutralizing shampoo and wash and rinse at least three times. If there are still traces of relaxer in your hair, continue to wash until all traces have been removed. Once all traces of relaxer have been removed, apply the neutralizing shampoo to the hair again. Leave the neutralizer in for 10 minutes. It is very important that you leave the neutralizer in for 10 minutes. Do not skip this step. Next, the neutralizer can be rinsed. Now you can apply the protein treatment, and then follow with the moisture treatment as previously discussed. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|MYU46ap5aa	You can do a google search for hair care.

You need to develop a hair care regimen.<br>  <br>  Wash your hair every 3 days or once a week with a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Find the right products for your hair type and stick with them. <br>  <br>  (I hear Glover's Mane is a pretty good product... doesn't smell the best but its been said to have a growing effect-- tho technically Minoxidil is the only proven product to grown women's hair and Finesteride for men)<br>  <br>  Avoid using too much heat. If you get relaxers-- go to a professional. If you get braids-- don't get them too tight. Give your hair time to breathe in between weaves if you wear them. <br>  <br>  Wrap your hair with a silk or satin head wrap at night too or get a satin/silk pillow set and sheets. Unlike cotton, it prevents breakage... you know, split ends and stuff.<br>  <br>  Time and patience is really what you need and a good hair care regimen.<br>  <br>  I'm growing my hair out too and I'm using the whole Aphogee Line of hair care products. I was my hair every 3 days and I use lots of moisturizing products and conditioning sprays. Plus I stay away from heat as much as possible and am trying to break away from braids cause they do tend to put a lot of tension on my edges. <br>  <br>  The way you eat believe it or not has a lot to do with healthy hair too. Drink lots of water, eat well balanced meals and exercise regularly. It has its benefits on hair, nails and skin. Water works wonders. Trust me.<br>  <br>  You might wanna try some natural products too, like hair mayo and shea butter and jojoba oil and aloe vera. Good luck!|`|hP4viLh5aa	Take vitamins with folic acid Vitamins A B and E. Growth starts from within. And also invest in a good leave in moisturizing conditioner. Mazani makes a good one.

Products can not work miracles, if you abuse your hair with relaxers too often and that are too harsh or you flat iron your hair weekly you're hair will break as fast as it is growing so you see no extra length. If you want healthy long hair you need good techniques along with good products. I personally recommend you go natural if you haven't already. No matter how well a relaxer is applied it damages your hair. You don't state whether you are relaxed, natural and what texture of hair you have but the following advice is pretty standard. <br>  <br>  STEPS TO GET HEALTHIER HAIR:<br>  1. You may need to start over and just chop the hair off it is completely unhealthy right now but if you want to hang out to it until healthy hair comes in you can do that to. You need to do regular protein treatments (like Aphogee 2 step). These will not repair hair but it will stop breakage for now. STOP using heat and relaxers immediately. This is very important. If you choose to not stay natural, at least know that the best time to apply relaxer is after hair has grown long.<br>  <br>  2. Condition after every time you wash. I like Pantene Relaxed and Natural. It has a lot of slip so detangling is a breeze. Don't forget to deep condition and have leave in conditioner every day. <br>  <br>  3. Find out what ingredients in hair products are harmful. Ditch all products where the 1st ingredient is mineral oil and petroleum, these are not moisturizing and coat hair like plastic, clogging pores and cuasing dry hair. Conditioner does not =moisture. Water is moisture and then you use conditioner to seal in that moisture.<br>  <br>  4. Recognize what causes breakage. Unhealthy hair is the main culprit but rough fabrics, heat, dry hair, brushing, rough detangling, coloring, repetitive styling can make situation worse. Always wear a satin cap to bed and sleep on satin pillowcase. Limit chemicals in your hair if you put them in at all. And don't do the same style every day. <br>  <br>  5. Detangle hair only when conditioned. You also need to put the hair in protective hair styles like buns, twists, coils, braids, etc. Weaves are also a protective hair style. <br>  <br>  WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: Basically, I would do some protein treatments, some deep conditioning treatments for a month or so. I also highly recommend henna for you: <a href="http://hennaforhair.com" rel="nofollow">http://hennaforhair.com</a> . It is a natural conditioner and can make hair stronger and healthier. It can stop any breakage. STOP STRAIGHTENING AND USING HEAT AND RELAXING YOUR HAIR! I know this that will be difficult for some but it's important. Next, put your hair into a protective weave/braids for awhile to just let hair grow. Before you know, your hair will be crazy long.

4kk0HaAZaa	Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture gets great reviews on Daily Makeover.  You can check out what others had to say about that product and other oil-free moisturizers at this link: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dailymakeover.com/products?showcolor_option=&category=Moisturizers&brand=all&keyword=oil-free&colorinfo=no&showcolor_option=" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymakeover.com/products?sh...</a><br>  <br>  I do think that oil-free is important for you, since you are looking for a light moisturizer.  The other tip I'd give you is that you should let your moisturizer sink in to your skin for 15 mintues or so before you start applying makeup.  Otherwise, the moisturizer can affect the way your makeup looks, causing it to settle in creases and shift around in a very unflattering way!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

After all thirty is the new twenty, forty is the new thirty and you are only as young as you feel and besides ugly old frump dresses just make a woman look and feel older.  If she has the body,the attitude, and it looks good on her; she should wear what she wants.  I would never ever wear anything frumpy or dowdy just because someone says it's aimed at women my age.

UrYYKkGoaa	Well, the next time you get slapped (and it seems likely), you can restore your skin's good health by a) applying a cold compress (no ice directly on your skin, please!), and applying witch hazel or cucumber extract or essence to provide more relief.

I am specially trained in physical intervention and what u should do is (it will look funny) is put both your forearms (w/ fist pointing up) in front of your face. while the actual slap is happening push the salp away and do a 360 w/ ur body. this will get u away from the slap and the slap away from you. i have had to do this MANY times and it works on my developmentally disabled folks, so it should work on girls....or maybe avoid what u did to get slapped in the 1st place...lol  good luck to ya.|`|C6S20vqkaa	yep. if you do a karate block you should be able to stop the slap midair. i mean use your forearm to block the hand at the wrist. try to avoid it in the first place tho - prevention is better than cure!

SIUKasInaa	your hair probably needs more moisture in it.<br>  condition it with a stronger one.<br>  and leave it in longer. conditioner tends to weigh down hair as it deposits oils and softeners into your hair.<br>  <br>  try combing it down flat. beginning at the bottom and working towards the roots to further reduce frizz. <br>  <br>  you can also buy anti frizz shampoos and conditioners that will both reconstruct your hair and allow for more moisture to penetrate into your hair and somewhat control it.<br>  <br>  if you must use gels. i say make a mix at home of parts gel parts water, this way you get a small amount of gel to weigh it down, but not the crispy hair that comes with using styling product.|`|OCMSTxYfaa	after you wash your hair...use a good conditioner, and yes you will have to straighten you hair for the look you want...use a leave in conditioner on wet hair..it's a spray..but it works great..Matrix Biolage Smoothing Shine Milk..and after your hair is dry use spray to keep your hair from frying Matrix sleek.look.

The hair straightening tool can overrule any type, any quality easily and can even bring back life to damaged hair. <br>  How will you use the ceramic plated straightening apparatus to straighten your hair? Very simple! You can easily floor someone by your flat hairstyle. You need to take around two inches of hair and plug it in between the plates of the hair straightening apparatus. Then roll the flat iron as if pressing the hair. But the rule to be followed here is the flat iron has to be used in a straight direction from top to the bottom. Therefore it will first strike the roots of the hair, then the body and finally come town to the end tips. <br>  If you can get hold of a hair straightening apparatus that is run with the help of heat produced by infrared technology, the effect you will get is the best. Your hair can be easily straightened by removing all sorts of twists and curls and also the damped portions due to extra moistening. The heat absorbs all those. And you can really get a mirror quality of your hair.

K70Hkq5haa	Yes. And anything else like dark circles under eyes(if you have that) also, if you get the wrong self tanner it'll make you look like you have an orange hue. Personally, I love beach tanning best. I was raised by the ocean and something about sea water was so beneficial from getting colds or the flu. Note, just don't overdue being in the sun too long. Self tanners to me are messy and never get the right tanning results. If you're worried about your stretch marks, try cocoa butter. There are also other products over the counter you may want to experiment with.|`|OhkY8n7Yaa	Yea....i mean it is still skin!!<br>  <br>  If it doesnt darken then it will only look shiny...<br>  <br>  if the self tanner doesnt work try make up that is water proof!!|`|M0PW6LZTaa	Stretch marks will fade naturally with time try cocoa butter or bio oil, works for a lot of people. Self tan will cover up, but adjust the tone/colour to get a good match.

GsR3KkXnaa	Okay well i have had infected earrings many times!<br>  take out the earring clean the holes extrmely well with rubbing alchohol, then put vaseline or newsporin on the hole and the earring ansd put it back in. they should heal up in know time. also it could be that your allergic to the way the place pierces them. thats why i decided to pierce my own ears from now on. its not painful message me if you want to know how, and there is no blood when peircing yourslef.|`|4bghZWwSaa	I have 4 piercings on each ear, and then one actually towards the top of my ear in the cartiledge.  The piercings in the cartiledge are definitely more prone to reactions.  I can only wear mine during the day, and can only wear either sterling silver or solid gold.  The hypo-allergenic ones did not even cure my sensitivity.  Since yours are still semi-new, you may want to try getting some small dangling sterling silver or gold ones to wear at night, so at least some air can get around there, since you don't want to go without all night at this point.  You may also want to try some Bactrine.  I found that works better than the hydrogen peroxide.  It's just a first aid liquid that you can find at any drug store, or walmart.|`|gxJZScDIaa	The same happened to me. Did you get the piercings with a gun or a needle?<br>  If with a gun it's probably shattered the cartilage. (Or you could be allergic to whatever the earrings are made out of.)<br>  What I did with mine is I cleaned them twice a day and after two years they were fine.<br>  Personally, I don't think it's worth it but because I was so sure it was an infection and becasue of that I couldn't take the earrings out.<br>  But if you are sure it's an infection get some new earrings and see how your are with them.<br>  As your situation seems pretty similar to mine continue to clean them and take them out. It's not worth it.<br>  Good luck.|`|94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	no its not normal, you most likely need to change the type of earrings. <br>  Make sure they are hypoallergenic and nickel free.|`|VTb8FpzHaa	i don't know
yLY8B4scaa	try Sally Hansen Lip Extreme or something like that its in a gold bar looking lip gloss case, or try Lip Venom from Sephora that works really well and is pretty cheap|`|1EhbLBkUaa	It's true, to an extent.  Basically, they irritate your lips, so that the blood flow increases, trying to get rid of the irritant, so they do plump slightly and redden.  It's not a dramatic increase, but it's more than nothing.  Basically, it's the same thing that happens if you rub your lips a bit; look in a mirror, rub your lips vigorously for a couple seconds, then look again. That's as much difference as you'll see.

PPyMhRJAaa	My sister got married 7 years ago, and I was her bridesmaid. I have a swallow tattoo on my left arm, about 2" by 1" and she wanted me to cover it up for the day. She got me this stuff called Dermablend, and it seemed to do the trick. It wasn't noticeable at all - even in the photos. Hope you have a lovely wedding!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dermablend.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dermablend.co.uk/</a>|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I've never tried it but I've heard lots of good things about Dermablend for covering tattoos temporarily - and you can buy that online in the UK! <a href="http://www.garden.co.uk/php/browseCategory.php?cat=690&catClr=" rel="nofollow">http://www.garden.co.uk/php/browseCatego...</a>|`|euZRbiA2aa	I have an offensive tattoo i have to cover when i go swimming.So i went to boots the chemist in the pharmacy/medicine area i asked the lady about it.She toke me aside they had little samples of covering cream that they test against your skin tone when they had a perfect match they ordered a small jar for me.Its waterproof and really covers it so you cant see the tattoo.The name on the jar is veil cover cream,so go talk to a boots assistant.<br>  <br>  EDIT heres the veil website<br>  <a href="http://www.veilcovercream.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.veilcovercream.com/</a>|`|AA10823062	Theatrical make-up should work (short-term, of course -- a day or two). Before there was Photoshop and/or air-brushing, movie stars used it all the time to cover up not only tattoos but various types of blemishes. However, you would need to cover an entire area, not just the tattoo. For example, if the tattoo is just above  your ankle, you would need to go completely around the ankle, not just the part with the tattoo. Otherwise, it will look uneven. One of the qualities of theatrical make-up is that it sucks the light out of your life -- well, it absorbs light off your skin, anyway. If it did not, your skin would burn under stage-lighting. Bear in mind, though, that unlike regular make-up, you need to wait for stage make-up to dry. It takes at least an hour. If it is your wedding, I would wait 2 hours, to be sure.|`|J9pIrpkBaa	Surely no-one will see it if you are wearing a wedding dress????|`|rjac15O0aa	Foundation, yes make up.  If you want to remove it then get it lasered.|`|lf5ZXo9Eaa	I had to cover up some pretty big tattoos on my body for my wedding day and I used MAC Studio Finish Concealer.  The trick was NOT to sponge it on but to use a medium sized makeup brush and dab the concealer on bit by bit while trying to blend as well as possible.  Apply transluscent powder on top when finished and you should have a very good cover up.  I have a big tattoo in the center of my chest and 2 large ones on my arms.  This worked wonders for them.  And yes they sell MAC in England by the way :)|`|MI8WTnL4aa	you can try this from argos.

eRg04AoEaa	"Top Model" is run by a top moron.<br>  "Make Me  A Stupid Model" is just a group of morons.<br>  <br>  It can get confusing I know, but we'll help you through it. Ahhhh, yes, we'll help you!<br>  <br>  Oh gee, you weren't talking about the TV shows, were you? Oh well, too late, I like my answer anyways!|`|OHfZFR31aa	To me a top model is someone like Coco Rocha or Sasha P who gets lots of runway work, editorial work in magazines like Vogue, and big ad campaigns (YSL or Prada fragrances) -- but people who are not really into fashion have no idea what their names are. If you showed the Prada Infusion d'Iris or YSL Elle ad campaign to people and asked for the model's name, 90% wouldn't have a clue.<br>  <br>  A supermodel is someone like Kate Moss, Gisele, etc that even an 80 year old woman living on a farm can recognize and knows her name.|`|BGNdKvXzaa	I would guess that a supermodel is one who is known by her first name alone.  Top models can earn big bucks, but they may not be internationally known like a supermodel.<br>  <br>  For instance Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schieffer, and one or two more ruled the catwalks during the 1990s. Everyone knew their faces, and everyone wanted them in their shows. There are only a few ladies now, this Ms Michelle Brunshen I think (I am not familiar with her name, but she was with Mr. L.

LETd2hQwaa	What you need is a good hair care regimen. To be honest I find that a lot of products work well with all types of hair its just that they're not being used correctly or long enough. For your type of of hair, I would suggest Nexxus products. They are a professional line and they work really well. Try a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Any products for curly and extremely curly hair should be moisturizing or conditioning ones. Moisture is the key. Hairspray and mousse--- bad. Too high of an alcohol content. Dries your hair out instead of moisturizing it. The moisture keeps it from breaking and frizzing so much. Try Fantasia Hair Polisher Styling Gel instead. Leave in conditioners are great. And read the instructions on the products and actually follow them, they invented the product so they tell you how to use them because thats how the product works... and try to stay within the same product family--- because they really do work together.<br>  <br>  I think a graduated hair cut would be good for your hair. Or low layers. Keep in mind that your hair since its curly will shrink half an inch to 2 inches onces its dry if they cut it wet-- as a professional they should know that. So be careful with length decisions.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|0menTzHpaa	I think you should try a product called mixed Chick. It's for people with curly ahir. You don't have to be mixed to use it. If you go to the site, it has videos on how to use the product on curly hair. It helps keep down the frizz. If you don't want t o buy it, you can order a trial size for 99 cents plus s&h.|`|848a5d79d62c7693bfb3b4376038ddc7aa	Run, don't walk to this  website (www.mixedchicks.net).  They have exactly what you are talking about.  You can buy the stuff on line or go to a store that they list that carries it.  Here is the basic system...  <br>  <br>  1. shampoo<br>  2. deep condition<br>  3. work leave-in through wet hair and air dry..  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|K7vCWru6aa	I have hair like that so I use: Herbal Essences Shampoo, Conditioner, Gel and Mousse, the Gel helps with the frizz and keeps the curls in place, all my friends with curly hair also use it =) Good luck!|`|MYU46ap5aa	You should try Carol's Daughter's products.  It's for thick hair and African American hair types.  I see people of all races use her products.
KuMqqRKyaa	Hun, I would go with some bright pink tights and black peep toe heels myself, that would be a cute combiantion.  but regardless, you can wear just about any color tights with a black dress and wear some black heels to match.  the other option would be black tights with some colorful heels, but I would suggest the colored tights, you'll get more attention that way, lol...|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	that's cute! i would wear grey tights-but you could do a brightly colored pair of tights if you are feeling spunky!|`|hnhb119Laa	That's really perfect for NYC - I wear similar minidresses all winter, usually wool/cashmere, because I  work in a dressy office.  Black is neutral, so you can wear basically anything with it... but I would suggest staying dark, maybe  eggplant.  All black would be a bit much.  I would match your shoes to the stickings/tights, to make you look taller, and I would never wear flats with a short skirt.|`|XdL7hhq2aa	Girl I love the sweater dress! I would wear some silky black pantyhose, black boots or 3 inch black heels and find a black belt and you will be ready to go. <br>  <br>  Have fun,<br>  <br>  Emily|`|CvjRmk6Eaa	I would go with black ballet shoes and white leggings. all black might look cute.

If you were thinking of wearing tights I would suggest coloured or patterned to break up the black.

adyNCp6eaa	Your hair color changes as you get older, my hair used to be a brilliant red, but now its more like a red/blonde/light brown mix. If you grow it out and if you live in a very sunny place, then it should get lighter again by the sun. But maybe not as bright as it used to be when you were small.  Hope I helped! *~me~*|`|dBi35JDkaa	No. I used to have a REALLY light blond hair and it was straight now it's dark blonde (nearly brown) and VERY curly! I have to straighten it a LOT lol|`|QDaDjMdzaa	Your hair gets bleached by the sun, sea, chlorine, washing it. <br>  <br>  If you grow your hair - and don't dye it - it should get lighter. Your roots will always be darker then your tips.|`|rEmxMRILaa	no it wont because if ur in a sunny place like florida it will bleach it but if ur in a cold place like missouri then it wont..|`|JBtqIJzOaa	i wouldn't think so.<br>  it will become blonde-r in summer.<br>  you can opt to colour it though.
15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	Yes, whatever people say, that is the case - and there is a pecking order in universities too!<br>  I picked up my first degree from a decidedly red-brick university back in the 80's, and it was definitely second league to places like Oxbridge, Edinburgh, Durham and Bristol, but since so many new Universities were created from Polys and Colleges in the 90's, it now looks very respectable, as it counts as an 'old established' university!
SPMS5yIuaa	Not that i know of but you can grow your hair faster by not straitening it or by keeping it healthy and not frying it out. Also get trims like once every 2 to 3 months so your ends are healthier and faster growing:)|`|MYU46ap5aa	Try Biotin vitamins.

Drink plenty of water, exercise regularly and keep your body healthy.  Get your hair trimmed every 6 weeks (just get the dead ends cut off).  Try not to color your hair or do any heavy processing like perms or anything like that, just let it be.  Try to stay away from the heat styling as much as possible, no flat irons or even blow dryers really.. let your hair air dry but if you have to use one of those items, use a moisturizing creme to help keep hair soft and smooth and make sure to use a heat defense spray as well (it'll help protect against the damage and breakage those items cause.)  Don't wash your hair every day, every other day or even every two days if your hair isn't that oily -- and condition, condition, condition!  Let the conditioner set in your hair while you do everything else in the shower (wash, shave, whatever) just don't wash it out after the minute or two the bottle recommends (usually I leave mine in for at least 5 minutes, sometimes more haha) And get a shampoo and conditioner that is made for your hair type (wavy, dry/damaged, normal, oily, color treated, etc.)|`|ESAMvi4taa	TIme, good care (like not using shampoos with harsh sulfates that are in most commercial shampoos...actually baby shampoo is very gentle on hair), and a proper vitamin regimen will work wonders.  Try adding some Biotin (in 1000 mcg doses) and a multivitamin into your regimen.  Biotin thickens the hair shaft and stimulates hair follicles.

Hello, infection! Wait until you're all grown up and get a real tattoo-you know, one done by a real tattoo artist at a real shop where your skin will be looked after.

At absolute best you will end up with a horrible mess on your body. Far more likely you'll end up with a nasty skin infection plus a horrible mess. And possibly you'll end up seriouly ill with hepatitis, mrsa, septicemia, and the likes. PLUS a horrible mess, of course.<br>  If you want a tattoo, do the traditional thing. Save up some money (it's great when you've earnt it), work on a design and go to a reputable studio. What you're suggesting is extremely naive, immature and irresponsible, and something I absolutely promise you you'll regret.|`|kCdISEGqaa	The answer is simple, no, the ink won't stay in the skin and look like a tattoo.  If you cut yourself, creating a wound big enough to scar, your body will reject any kind of foreign substance in the scabs and push the ink from the Sharpie out.  The ink in permanent markers is dangerous and can cause health problems, it's not meant to be in the skin.  Tattooing is a much different process and the body reacts and heals differently than scarring yourself and coloring it in.  Just wait until you're old enough and get it done right.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	if you are putting ink on a scar it is no different then putting it on plain skin. if you are putting it on a cut then no, it won't stay. my friend used to cut, and to hide it she would draw on the cuts with permanent marker and make a design-and she never had any of the ink stay.|`|MV0lMuDMaa	those markers arent meant to get in your blood stream so im sure they wont be good for you.  if youre not old enough to get a tattoo just wait thats really not a good idea.|`|rjac15O0aa	Wow, buddy...

They used a pocket knife and carved this symbol into themselves (still makes me cringe). They then used a Sharpie to "color" it in.  It works. He still has it several years later. It just looks like crap and it has faded. I don't know if that was just from how he did it or because he doesn't take care of it but....<br>  <br>  And yes, he could have easily poisoned himself. But he was fine. I don't recommend doing that at all.

LETd2hQwaa	Well if you used a chemical relaxer to straighten your hair permanently then a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner for chemically treated hair/colored/damaged hair would be best. Aphogee makes pretty good products for this. Also, Find a good moisturizer to put in your hair daily. A hair treatment once a month is good. Avoid using too much heat (blow dryers, curling irons, flat irons), wrap your hair up at night with a satin head rag, get a touch up relaxer every 6-8 weeks to maintain the new growth. See a professional in your area when in doubt or when its time for a touch up.|`|eLxD5HbBaa	If its been permanantly straightened chemically it really should maintain itself look after it like how you would your normal hair, you also might need some more conditioning or leave in contitioner because the straigtening can leave your hair quite brittle... You can leave it dry, blow dry or straighten with your flat iron and it should give you the same results...when its starts to grow out you may need to straighten the roots to get rid of the fuzzy bits but other than that just lightly blow dry and it should be great!|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	if you had a permanent straighten on your hair then why do you need a hair dryer or straightening irons on it|`|UWpAcYnxaa	plz plz plz send to "mahataj1998@hotmail.com" the way you permenantly straightened your hair. i got terrible hair trust me!|`|iS8UxcJsaa	if you got it professionaly and chemically straightened and it didn't last long, that might be all u can do. Check out a cosmetology school, i think they give free hair cuts and styles. see if they have something that ur lookin for.

I have curly hair and straighten it all the time. then i notieced split ends up the yin yang, and dry damaged ends, and it's just gross! i'm tryin to only straighten my hair once a week at most now, and it's already gotten healther. Why do u want straight hair so bad?

Look at the ingredients on the back of the conditioner bottle, if the first ingredient is alcohol, it's not good for your hair. Make sure you're using a conditioner where alcohol is NOT the first ingredient. <br>  Also, when you blow dry your hair, after it's dry turn your hair dryer onto the "Cool air" setting and let the cool air hit the ends of your hair, this will help smooth down your ends and help to hide what split ends you do have.<br>  You may also want to start using (if you're not now) an Ionic hair dryer, they aren't much more expensive and the air is better for your hair.|`|HxtKRMKAaa	Firstly Prevention is the key.<br>  Invest in a good products for your hair type, From the shampoo and conditioner to the combs and brushes. All these things affect the hair.<br>  Unless hair is short Do Not Comb when the hair is dry, rather use a natural boar bristle brush. Do not yank comb or brush through knots but rather work them out starting from the bottom working your way up the length until knot free. Other wise you break/snap the hair when it is stretched to the max causing splits.<br>  Secondly the more frequent your hair trims the less splits you will have. When however you do go for a long spell without maintenance then you can cheat by using a good quality conditioner that is safe to leave in even though it is not marketed as a leave in conditioner. Place a dollop in hand and rub in hands and then spread just on the ends of hair. This apparently smooths the follicles and hides the worst of the split appearance. Nothing cures it though your just have to cut them out.<br>  If you had directed the hairdresser in not cutting too much off the length it would result in not all splits being removed.<br>  Sometimes the damage is so bad that your only option is to visit a few times until all damaged ends have been removed over a period of time.<br>  This handy hint was passed on to me by my hairdresser.<br>  Again this will be based on the type of hair that you have so you should speak to your hairdresser to get the names of the products that best suit your hair type.<br>  Finally be sure you are going to a Good Hairdresser. A lot out there do use scissors that are blunted from the many hours of cutting and do not have spare ones. Blunt blades cause damage to hair as well as lack of expertise.|`|9EY57YtMaa	dont use heat on your hair for awhile, especially since you just got a haircut<br>  if you just go use heat the nxt day that defeats the purpose of getting  a haircut, your just going to have split ends all over again<br>  <br>  it sounds to me your hair is damaged...you rally just gotta let it grow back in plcae.|`|cQJGaUK4aa	you need to get more cut, and then start new keeping your hair from splitting.|`|IowG78BGaa	herbal essences herbal hydration or the new one that came out. buy the shampoo and conditioner, use about a quarter size of conditioner and leave it in for 2 minutes, and especially work it into the ends. your split ends could have come from straightening/curling irons, dyeing, or perming, if you do any of those, try to do it less often. hope i helped!|`|LBZPm5rgaa	The best thing for split ends is Paul Mitchell's super skinny. you just need a dime size drop. then if you have a flat iron you can use that.  use it on dry hair, if it smokes that is just the product burning of, not your hair.|`|O8RuSBAjaa	Your hair may be too dry.

kCdISEGqaa	Your best bet would be to go to an artist and ask them to look at the scars.  Not all artists can tattoo over scars, you really need to find someone with experience.  Scar tissue is thin and when tattooing it, there is potential to upset the tissue and cause it to become a keloid.  It takes longer because you have to be extra careful, and it is more sensitive because it is already scarred.

The boys, who don't even really care, are just the excuse.|`|eDP3YU5Laa	is ur sister de one in de picture?|`|HiuZs5G5aa	yes i do and im a guy.  i like girls who care about themseleves but don't go overboard with it like your sister.  and she is attracting all sorts of men not just the pervert ones.|`|0MOXObjkaa	YESSS ITS SO ANNOYING!

" make myself look good to feel confident about MYSELF when I look in the mirror, not for perverted ugly dudes.    don't you hate girls who over obsess about their looks to attract men who only want them for sex?"    so then what's with the slutty profile pic?|`|XyOsRQvgaa	i totally agree. one of my best friends is like that. i went to her house for a sleep-over, and it's kind of mean to say cause she's a sweetheart and i love her, but all she talked about the whole night (literally) was how depressed she was that she hadn't had a boyfriend yet (at 15!), and that she was going to 'change her style' to preppy and get a nose job when she was 18 so that guys would like her.  i take care of myself for me, not some horny boy who just wants something to rub his junk on ?|`|a38LoaBiaa	um..ya|`|SZ9BNWVIaa	........  hypocrate  xx|`|KH9HROrSaa	i agree with you completely. wear what you want to wear, because half the time guys don't even care what you have on.|`|qVhqc019aa	I have never cared about what guys like me for.

BaIWuzeiaa	Practice before the wedding. Try them on while sitting on a chair then stand up carefully and try to hold your balance. If you feel like you can't hold your balance, keep standing up and sitting down untill you have a good balance. Then start taking baby steps, you will be walking in those heels before you know it! :)|`|Y0O6971laa	Heel to toe.  Slowly and make sure you don't trip.  Good luck!|`|wV21OIMtaa	Very carefully!

Even out your balance, evenly distribute it. Walk heel to toe. Good Luck|`|4390bb90650dd6c01c8e995784774d46aa	DEFINITELY practice in them.  Hmmm, I always walk toe heel in my heels.  I guess everyone has to find what works for them.  When you wear them at home to practice the first few times, concentrate on thinking about how you normally walk and go from there.  I'd practice just standing in them first.|`|87f70fdbab08390c30f81178c17880b2aa	Practice Practice Practice...

UrYYKkGoaa	Buff buff buff, then moisturise with a good quality oil or moisturiser on moist skin.    Moisturiser, baby oil, vaseline etc won't work if all you're doing is greasing dead skin, so you must exfoliate first!    I use a loofah in the shower, and then afterwards, I buff with a DRY terry cloth bath mitt (or a cotton terrycloth face cloth) for about 30 seconds on each limb, 30 seconds on my bottom, and 30 seconds everywhere else (except my face). Then I moisturise. You buff by applying a fair amount of force in long steady strokes. You should notice ribbons of dead skin collecting on your skin and the bath mitt.    Be sure to use a TERRY CLOTH bath mitt, not a loofah or hemp bath mitt - they are too harsh to use dry. Use the loofah wet in the shower.|`|CFNozZM8aa	Exfoliation and moisturization are key to getting soft, smooth skin.  You could buy a exfoliating scrub at basically any store that sells bath stuff, or you could use plain sugar.  To use sugar, just put a bit in the palm of your hand and mix in a few drops of water to get a pasty-like consistency.  Then, rub onto skin in circular motions.  If you find it too abrasive, add more water.  If it's not abrasive enough, add more sugar.  You could use this on any part of your body, including your face.  I usually exfoliate from head to toe about twice or three times a week.    Of course, moisturize!  Find a moisturizer that works for you and your skin type.  I like Eucerin Plus Smoothing Essentials.  It's super fast-absorbing, and leaves skin soft and smooth all day.    Good luck!|`|G2uCvhh6aa	When i get out the bath i rub baby oil all over while i'm still wet then i dry it off with a towel.    Sounds a bit kinky but you'll have very soft skin lol|`|HakCVqMdaa	ive tried this before if u actally take a bath with milk , some honey and the water to be kind of hot but not really hot its great and you can take a full bath by scrubing yourself with oranges after you juice them and scrub them on your body then u would get soft skin after a while scrubing .
hLdIO43Xaa	It's just a discharge, it means your body is cleaning itself, in a sense. It's a good thing! It means your body is taking care of yourself, fighting against and preventing infections  If you feel self conscious, you can purchase panty liners.  Don't worry about it!  If you still are questionable about it, for more info, see here:  http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health...|`|QSQ2AsBdaa	heyy don't worry, its totally normal! :)  its discharge and if you get it before you start your period, it means ur nearly gonna get it  good luck x|`|LANQjVocaa	Probably a yeast infection talk to your older siblings (female) or mother.

eDKSKqcSaa	You dont suck honey. I think I changed a lot last year when I got a bike and started cycling everywhere! I started wearing different clothes just because they were good for cycling, wearing my hair differently, sure... but most of all I FELT great -  so independent, healthy,better appetite, stronger body,  full of energy.. and was so much happier! And everyone commented on these things.    Throwing yourself into a new and healthy hobby is a better way to change dramatically than changing your style, in my opinion.    Let us know how you get on!|`|nFdApwgbaa	I understand completely, but here is the thing, unless you move it takes A LOT to change your reputation, i don't know what yours is, but if you want to be nicer and have more friends, you can't ever be mean.  and you cant change your interests, that's just who you are.  Don't try to change to be like everybody else, people like people who are different and fun! What will really change your reputation will be your confidence. If you believe you are an interesting and different person, others will too!|`|GKJEgidzaa	Oh you want to change 'dramastically' ?  :) That made me giggle.    You died your hair? murderer, you dyed your hair perhaps?      Okay.

But don't change the way in which you act.|`|BA9hUOsoaa	Happy Birthday, why dont you join a gym, do some dance classes or something, learn something new and make friends in the process, this could change you and you will get fitter as you are doing it :)|`|JoZcZJFfaa	why do you want to change  the best thing about life is you being who you really are  an individual  changing just so others can look at you a certain way  is just trying to be invisible, trying to fit into the norm

4x1YYHE9aa	personally, I love to wear heels because I feel more feminine and there are so many different kinds of heels.

The feeling is just as strong in a pair of western boots and the perfect jeans.  High heels add height but also improve your posture.  You must stand straight up with shoulders back and chin up.

It makes me look skinnier than when I wear sneakers..  Does wearing heels make me feel more confident ? Not really.   I'm still me with sneakers or high heels on.|`|chB3yqBbaa	i somewhat enjoy wearing high heels. im only 13 so i havent had to wear like 4in heels alot. but when i do, i have to admit i feel really confident cause with 4in heels im almost 6' (im 5'7") and i have an older brother whos 16 and sadly only 4'8", so i tower over him. like one time my mom took a pic of him standing next to me while i had these heels on, and he didnt even reach to my chest area. when he looked straight at me, he saw my bellybutton lol. so i guess i do love high heels.

c1wCuGzpaa	Mary Kay products :):) Its called satin hands :):) Oh my goodness it is awsome. Your hands will feel like baby skin :)|`|mNJFttV6aa	My preference is lanolin which I use at night before bed and it makes my hands silky soft while I sleep!  I prefer the creamy kind.  Don't use it if you are allergic to wool though.|`|pW1vRrx3aa	Razac Hand And Body Lotion. :)|`|Ye4qdX4Gaa	Lotion works for me.|`|ZYUpEdcqaa	well, I actually use lotion.  There are different kinds though that won't do that to you.  I use something called cocoa butter cream.  Just don't use ones that are super oily.  I guess baby powder would work.  I have never tried it, but I know what you mean with hand sanitizer.  I love the stuff.|`|praNSGXhaa	i use lotion... get the not greasy kind... aveno|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	Use a good baby oil or essential oil to place in you bath tub. It doesn't take much to make it oily.  maybe 1 tbsp will do. Place it in while water is running so it can get all over. You can add bubbles if you want too. But anyway, soak in that for as long as you want and you shouldn't need lotion afterwards. It makes you REALY soft.  :]
6CUvU9D4aa	yah girls can notice stuff like that realllll good :) |`|XyOsRQvgaa	nah, i don't think so. i used to know this guy that was absolutely insane, and one day in math class he stood up and was all "who here is wearing angel?" and went around sniffing all of the girls, because he claimed he could smell it. you might have a weak sense of smell, but i don't think it's got anything to do with you being a guy.|`|djhCah5Maa	Sometimes hormones can make our sense of smell much stronger.  Especially if women are pregnant.  I can smell everything during that time of the month.|`|1UhFVCcIaa	possibly|`|rV21SE3aaa	Yeah it says women have a stronger sense of smell then men.
PWkWptVuaa	Depends on how you apply it - it looks bad when applied badly.    But if you want to then do.|`|kMsShtwpaa	it depends if its applied badly or not :)|`|4BQvv9Etaa	if u want 2 sure. just make sure it looks nice n don't give a s*it about wat others say|`|szFDOaJLaa	Personally, I don't think it looks great, less is more.  However, if you apply it well, and it looks good, then go for it!|`|6YTSD3pdaa	No it looks nasty instead of making you look pretty..|`|VN2wyTnFaa	Only wear what you really feel is necessary. Don't wear foundation unless you're unhappy with your skin, don't wear mascara unless you really want to pump up your lashes. All that sorta stuff. Don't wear it just to wear it though.
hLdIO43Xaa	A light sunshine yellow is perfect!    As an artist: Blue and yellow are opposites on the color wheel, making them complementary colors. When paired together, they'll make each other pop!    Dark blue is a classic, but can be kind of boring unless you want to go for a clean, preppy look.    Green is fun but sometimes competes too much with the blue.|`|xOqhA1Unaa	lite green  sea fome green  maybe light yellow  magenta  navy|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Lt. blue goes w/navy and also believe it or not w/brown.  I wouldn't go w/green or yellow.|`|AA11383707	Dark blue is best out of those. But for a light blue, I'd go for something black or violet. Depends on what you're doing.|`|jPJaSIXPaa	yellow or mint green|`|pDwdUN8Aaa	green is the colour that i will pick but they all match  I think that anything matches light blue well good   luck with mathiching you colours|`|AZ3dH2Knaa	Dark Blue!     you silly!|`|p4FEe41Laa	DARK BLUE.|`|bVF8xp9Laa	Yellow (and White)|`|tXMDzQ9jaa	i think you should go with green. dark blue and light blue is TOO much blue and yellow and light blue just don't go. and make sure green isn't too pale or too dark! hope i helped! :]|`|SS87lbOCaa	DARK BLUE  YELLOW  GREEN  WHITE BLACK|`|M5rygNkpaa	White        Pink      green (not as much)      black      brown       yellow      Dark blue     -I know some of them have been suggested-        It depends on the outfit, a yellow cami and a blue top is cute... it really depends on what is light blue, and what type of shirt or pants it is....|`|9WIbZUH0aa	green|`|TU95i2R2aa	white
G1XIgP3laa	I'm not sure if you mean the same stuff that you use for the face so if not then ignore this but if you are using the same stuff read on :]  If you do proactiv after moisturizing it is just going to exfoliate off your moisturizer.   Step 1 is an exfoliating scrub meant to remove dead skin and cleanse the skin.  Step 2 is a toner that calms the skin and opens the pores.   Step 3 works to heal and moisturize your new skin from where you exfoliated in Step 1.     I hope that helped. You can try both but I think you will have better luck moisturizing after proactiv   Good Luck!|`|qYVJHc7Yaa	According to my experience, I have doing proactiv after moisturzing.  Hope can help you!|`|ysJusb21aa	Use the clarifying lotion before you use the moisturizer.|`|oWpckmWvaa	do proactiv before moisterizing or else the proactiv will just take it off anyways!  i love proactiv !|`|o0eklQM9aa	I would use the moisturizer after Proactiv because the moisturizer might be removed by the Proactive if you use it first.
PpfmPV44aa	omg i like all of them!!! my favorites are the angel bites and the nape. i'm not really a fan of the medusa though|`|jsCjGUPuaa	i love the anti-eyebrow but only if you can pull it off..  i like cheek piercings but those i think you should only get if you smiile a lot because they just look stupid to hav metal in your face|`|5BOhn6Ubaa	nape.|`|q6r3dByraa	nape|`|KrMPaCNGaa	Anti eyebrow and nape :D dimple piercings are cute but i dnt think ide ever get em lol|`|eoGBWU3Oaa	I love the medusa piercing. I think that the monroe piercings can look a little tacky on some people, unless you have the features to pull it off.     Personally, I'd go for the medusa. It's a nice, simple piercing that you don't see on too many people.|`|aJnyY9ynaa	nape|`|igrdohopaa	Nape (=|`|XyOsRQvgaa	personally, i think the anti-eyebrow is gorgeous ?|`|s5kNjljMaa	Angelbites look very nice

If you like it, go for it!!|`|d8jH5lU1aa	Yeah it looks good=]|`|SS87lbOCaa	yea it looks good on you! ;)|`|N2O9LUwaaa	I don't really think so, dude. But, I'm a guy so I might not know what's best.|`|hvJ3rQfFaa	yea....really hot mam|`|NAvaa1Araa	Uh it's okay.......not really.
rtx0YQDJaa	you can use a non scented moisturizer, no gels or ointments...they are too thick.|`|ktGPcQxQaa	Cortisone 10..I have used it with all my tattoos, so has my sister, mother and stepfather.|`|7WUvPI8maa	A&D original ointment works good... i've used it with all my tattoos|`|4vqzkIr4aa	Vaseline is not used to keep the skin from drying during a tattoo. It is actually used to help blood coagulation during the tattoo process. It keeps the area from becoming a bloody mess when packing in lots of color or doing a piece on a bleeder. I would ONLY use vaseline during this process. Any alternative will be very costly and actually the same thing. Like a medical grade vasetration like cut doctors use on fighters that get cut.    So to more accurately answer your question, do not use anything other than vaseline and its all natural make up unless of course you have connections with a fight doctor and he can get you the better stuff. But you really do not need anything that severe. The bleeding and plasma from tattooing is not as great as a cut from a punch so the vasoline is just fine.|`|kCdISEGqaa	I use A&D.  Been in it 14 years, A&D works well.|`|RLoBuvZnaa	Vaseline isn't used to keep the skin from drying out...  It is used to primarily to lubricate the needles to help them penetrate the skin.  Preferences vary, but the most common substitute is A+D ointment.      There are many tattoo artists who don't use anything because if you get vaseline/ointment all over your needles then you have problems with ink flow.    If you are using Vaseline and it's working for you, then there's no reason to change.|`|vd9mdriYaa	AQUAPHOR!!!!!!                      TRUST ME!
AbYzCDeuaa	They have rinses for hair.  Try those.
9WIbZUH0aa	it works really great (I've tried everything too.  Proactive DOES SUCK!!! Didn't do anything for me either.), but only if you do they entire system every night, and if you want faster results, every morning, too.  All my acne is gone now!! yippee!  The good thing about murad is that once you're done with it and your acne's gone, they have another set to keep it gone.|`|8THz1sp9aa	I've tried everything from murad to proactiv to store bought topicals to herbal remedies. I have very sensitive skin and my face would break out constantly. I finally came across an article about Apple Cider Vinegar and how thankful I am to have found it! Buy unpasteurized apple cider vinegar (i know it sounds disgusting, and it is! but its very much worth it when your skin starts to clear up) every morning and night mix two teaspoons of ACV with a cup of water (i actually just put two teaspoons of water with the two teaspoons of ACV and found it working a lot faster) anyway.. if you don't believe me you can look it up ACV has so many benefits its ridiculous. You can also dip a cotton ball in a tiny amount of ACV and dab it onto the red areas on your skin and it'll really help reduce the redness.
q411DXsFaa	Your hair is already dead so nothing can really kill it. But! blow drying can cause several split ends and your hair may break off.|`|FV0BoSkTaa	It's not true...    Blow drying, or any other kind of heat applied to the hair is extremely bad.  If you just use a heat protectant spray though, its not that bad.
gfiTCFTeaa	well, this is what I do.     after i get out of the shower, I brush my hair and then part it on the left side.  Then, I spray spray gel in my hair.  thennn,,, i blow dry my hairr.   after thattttt, i take a chunk of my hair on the right side of my part and i put it on the side and put a bobby pin there.|`|0MOXObjkaa	ummm   head band  clib on the side  half up half down  bun  side pony  braid you bangs then pull it in front of your forehead like a head band  french braid  braid on the side  curly  wavy  crimped  bump down the middle:)|`|Eo1SpWeVaa	If you have long layers, you can always blow dry it and go through your ends with a curling iron.    You can also straighten it, or curl it all over.    I have long naturally wavy hair, and when I'm feeling lazy, I spray some spray gel in it, toss it around a little, add a few clips here and there and bam! Out the door!    Hope this helped.
Ao5aSAWiaa	Pac Sun sells them, they are great but muy expensive.    I would suggest, believe it or not aha, Macy's or JCP.

NcLV4Jmuaa	there are steps that you can get a girl to shave your hair. it all depends on how you would do it.    1 - you have to know that if the girl is a fun girl. most of the fun girls would do anything and would be honored if they could shave off somebody's hair. if she is that kind of person, approach her.    2 - ask her the most simplest question first. such as "hey, what do you think if i go bald?" if she is like smiling, that is a good sign. if she doesn't seem to show the exciting expression, hold on to your thoughts first. maybe she is the type that don't like people with bald head.    3 - if her movement is positive, ask this question after the first one with a 5 minute gap, "would you like to shave my head please? i would be honored if you would do it rather than some barber with creepy hands on my head"    4 - this is the step if she have accepted your invitation to shave your head. REMEMBER, that there is no rule in head shaving. give her a clipper and let her be free. don't ask too much please.    hope this can help.|`|CmGDp0Gwaa	ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, dude. i need a haircut BIG TIME. shave it for me. lol jk jk jk jk. just go up to her and start talking to her then get on the topic somehow and hopefully she will offer.. :)|`|F9qsRIrtaa	Um, you really can't ask this kind of question without being weird.  Having a girl shave your head isn't exactly a turn on.  I would be completely grossed out if some guy asked me to do that.  Instead, go to a hair place and get it shaved off.  Ask the hairdresser if you can donate the hair to make wigs for people with cancer.  I got some inches off my hair last summer and gave it to cancer kids and it really made me feel great about myself.  After you've done this, invite the girl out to dinner or to a movie instead of an awkward shaving date.  Your newly shaved head and your donation would even be a great conversation starter.  Good luck!|`|5EREj3qwaa	dude one thing you should know.... girls digg long hair... you should keep it the way it is.... if u want her to help you.... you need to hook up with her first|`|WN3QoGEqaa	show her a picture of  a charity drive head shave or celeb type wig supply for cancer kids and ask her if she might consider helping you donate time or your hair to one or help you organize one  Legalize the request with authentic assurances that your efforts funds will reach the correct recipients|`|1c76b6914c5a81657e108fb7a9d57143aa	Just ask "hey, will you shave my head?"|`|i7rEzn8daa	nooo!  ughh, i love guys with shaggy hair ;)|`|2WBs0QiXaa	Just talk to her, and just say 'dude, I need a haircut... Would you mind doing it?' lol who cares about being weird. Really... Just ask.|`|S9b20vZ0aa	idk...whatver u do she might still think its a little weird  just go up and talk to her...maybe talk about something funny or pranks the bring up how someone shaving there head is funny (but not britney spears, she might like her) and then like say hey why dont u shave mine? but i dont think she will and she might not talk to u again|`|8ldMwflKaa	It might not be the best idea.  I mean, if she likes your hair, then you could be ruining that for her.  But try to talk to her about it.  Compliment her- that's always a good idea.  Then compliment her hair.  When she says 'thanks', then you can tell her.  Say something like, "Oh, i was thinking about shaving mine off, i don't like it.  And then talk for a while. When the time is right, ask her to meet you somewhere so she could do it.
4vqzkIr4aa	Please, do not soak or cake on any ointment, specially vasoline. But I will say the best bet to apply your normal amount of ointment (I recomend A&D) and just keep the area covered with surran-wrap. I always instruct my clients to at least attempt to keep the piece covered for 3 days with surran-wrap. Even if they don't work at a truck wash. The surran-wrap will keep the area moist and allow the ointment to even work better. Using this method you will be amazed at the healing process. It may not even scab at all. The old thing of letting your tattoo breathe has been thrown out the window with the discovery of well the piece heals by actually keeping covered and separated from anything harmful. This is a technique that began becomeing popular about 6 years ago and has grown greatly around the industry.    You most likely will not be able keep all the chems and crap out of it if you get as wet as you state. But all you can do is make an effort to protect it. Use the surran wrap and be sure to take some to work with you and clean the area as often as you can to make sure you keep out as much of the harmful chems as possible.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	This is the only case where you should actually use vaseline. Vaseline is bad for normal tattoos because it blocks the tattoo from the air... TRANSLATION.... It KEEPS THE WATER OUT. Clean your tattoo in the morning and slap on a THICK COATING of vaseline. Cover it with plastic wrap and tape ALLL around the sides.   Do this as LATE as you can before you start and wash it off COMPLETELY as soon as your done. It MIGHT leach out the color a bit, but it will be much better than the alternative. You don't want to use anything like paper towel because it will just HOLD the water there, where as vaseline will repel the water.  The worst that will happen is that it will fade a bit, in which case you will simply need a touch up... which you would likely need anyways. The chemicals are the worst, as they can get in to your blood stream through the open wound.   Good luck!    RE to your added info... the only real damage you are going to get is a little fading. MOST tattoos fade and need to be touched up, it's not really something you can avoid. That's all the "damage" you can really do other than getting an infection or something like that.|`|qXlYy7uiaa	A tattoo is supposed to dry out, so it scabs up and keeps the ink in. When you get the scabs wet, they fall off, and the ink goes with it. That means scar tissue and ink loss on your part.     Now, when you combine plastic wrap and hot water, what do you get? Steam heat. Which is moist. Which makes the scabs come off prematurely. Which makes your tattoo look like ****.     Try your best not to get it wet. If it does get wet, just pat it dry with a clean paper towel and let it air dry.|`|WeUEAIg9aa	Where are you going to get it done??? Is it hidden well? Maybe, and this sounds ghetto, don't get me wrong, but if its like a leg or something, tape a washcloth to it.

TZWXvAqraa	if you straighten it a lot, curl it! i couldnt curl it either cause it was too heavy,  so what i did was played around with it, curled it as best as i could and then took a light, thin pony tail, then i pinned whatever fell out with a few bobbby pins.    you can tease it really big too!  most people tease it from the outside, but it comes out neater for me by ratting it from below..        you could pin your bangs up      you could put a head band in and make it poofy..          i dont know how you usually wear it.                if you do decide to cut it, get a ton of layers weather you hair is long or short!      hope i helped |`|YBbND7vlaa	you can do what i did i just went into a parlor found a hairdresser with a cute/nice hair cut and told her to cut it the same way and i loved it and i get it cut the same way all the time|`|q411DXsFaa	What the hecks a poop tube???       http://www.updo.info/     Try that web sit it will tell you how to do them.|`|lxSRIFK2aa	shave it off|`|usXTpoSwaa	poop tube|`|oWP2DjJoaa	Show us a picture.

Who knows who has been trying them on before you!|`|5dDNqwlzaa	Victoria Secret is a very reputable company, and they go through measures to assure customers their products are clean, so I wouldn't be too worried about the bras having parasites...  I read a similar article and it happened to a woman who was staying in Africa... it wasn't a new bra, it was just that a bug had laid larva in it, etc.      The most I would be worried about is someone having had tried on the bra (or even undies!) at the store and then deciding not to buy them, and then you buy them/wear them.  So all in all, I would wash it... in cold water and using a detergent (it's the detergent that kills the bacteria, etc.).    EDIT:    The glue they use for the boxes they ship their bras in can also give you a rash, not bacteria.  Another reason to wash them.

qQqC2cHIaa	No, it's considered by most fashion experts to be an out of date rule, along with shoes and purse matching and you had to wear white gloves in the afternoon, all are old fashion rules that don't need to be followed anymore.  I have a wonderful white wool winter coat that I wear with white winter boots, it would be pointless to wait until after Easter or Memorial Day to wear those! I wear what suits the weather, irregardless of colour.|`|uikl8g3saa	i stick to the classic rule of no white b-4 memorial day,but do wear off-white and winter white when ever possible!|`|D2clQfVXaa	Everyone always says you're not supposed to wear white before Memorial Day, which is May 25th this year. Easter is April 12th. But who cares? Wear what you want whenever if it looks good.

zBKjUTyNaa	Hi there,    My best advice would be using shampoo that's directly for volume.  I have the same problem as you, and I found out that using these few things worked extremly well, without making your hair greasy;    try using up-lifting products, they don't have to be of the expensive brand, but usually the more money you spend on these things, the better results you will get.    I use a volume booster, which is basicaly a leave-in conditioner. I put it in while my hair is wet, and while I blow dry it, it usualy stays nice and well, ' not flat '    ALSO!!! Depends on the type of hair you have, try teasing it!!  take the top layer of your hair, and put it so it is out of the way. Take your comb and grab the next layer and brush it the opposite way, it SHOULD look like a big nest if you are doing it right, then take your top layer which you previously ignored, and comb it ontop of the teased layer, or the nest. You should do this as close to your roots as possible! it really looks amazing.    Ps; you can also add in a little hair-spray!!  ( a little goes a long way!)|`|ZyQFd6NVaa	I think that halfway through the day when your hair starts to look flat put it up into a loose bun for a couple minutes and then it will be full of life and bounce. As for the greasyness i suggest getting dry shampoo.    Like Batiste Dry Shampoo 5.05oz.    Reviews of Batiste: Due to health limitations, I have searched high and low for a dry shampoo that actually worked and didn't break the budget. I hit the jackpot with the Batiste Dry Shampoo. By following the directions, it truly made my hair smell and feel clean, but most importantly, made my hair plump up - wild and full!! It was great working with my hair, and every single time I use it, I get compliments on my hair. Go figure! (I don't get them when I have freshly washed and fixed my hair! lol) I only wish it came in a bigger can - I'm on a mission to see if I can find one.  Comment | Permalink | Was this review helpful to you?  (Report this)               6 of 6 people found the following review helpful:    excellent product, March 30, 2008   By  K-sters (Orlando, FL) - See all my reviews     I looove this stuff!! I have really thick dry hair that i absolutely hate to have to wash every day but because my scalp gets so oily, I have to unless I use this fabulous product. Because my hair is dry (everywhere other than the scalp) I actually like the way my hair looks more with this than actually shampooing it and having it look super dry all over. If you feel like it "builds up" and isn't working, you're probably just spraying too close. Spray from far away, let it settle for a minute or so than brush/comb it through like the directions say. And it really doesn't need THAT much. It actually takes a few min for it to absorb all the oil. I think some of the reviewers who didn't like it probably put too much based on what they are saying. As far as the smell goes, it is really not that bad. My mom actually LIKED the smell. I can't say I like it, but I'm not grossed out by it at all, and besides it goes away almost right away. As far as baby powder vs. this thing..I hate the smell of baby powder so much but sometimes I will sprinkle a little in conjuction with this product and it works GREAT. I can go three days without washing my hair and it looks awesome (And I have really greasy hair.) LOVE IT.|`|4z0Lo0qTaa	Straighten your hair. =)|`|5eGs0wKPaa	use shampoo with volumizer and dont use so much conditioner if u use it or if u dont use it start. conditioner can make or break your 'do...also try not to touch it cuz the oils in ur skin will rub off on it makin it greasy and use hairspray to stop flatness also

6sjphNcPaa	don't have your top hit right at the hips because that will extenuate your hips. Extenuate the smallest part of the hour glass figure. A-line skirt that "float away from the body."|`|hLdIO43Xaa	You are a pear shape!  With a smaller bust, you'd look great with strapless and halters. A strapless ballgown would be nice on you!  Mermaid dresses would be great on you too, since it's be sleek and it will portray your hips in a great way  When choosing a sleeker dress, choose ones with an empire waist or a wrap dress which will flow over the hip area. Sleek shoes with a thinner heel will work better visually rather than clunky footwear.      For general clothes guidelines, see:  http://www.shapeyourstyle.com/pear.php    Check out these dresses!

Xl88AmV4aa	ooo that's tough because that would be wayyyy awkward! The next time that the teacher gives an assignment where you have to work with your partner, you should tell him. Or you could just say hey and talk to him for a while and have a conversation and then tell him that you got over him right after class or something. Good luck!    p.s. the other thing you could do is just say, "hello, im over you! deal" and then ignore him. But that would be mean tho. lol.    -Skye:)|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	tell him.  say, "listen. i don't like you, and it's going to be awkward if we continue this thing." then raise your hand and tell the teacher you need to move.    don't let him answer you back though.  leave him speechless.|`|CZszdtemaa	You shouldn't really need help.     You will always come accross awkward social situations. Don't read too much into it, just deal with it.    Worst thing to do would be to tell him you don't like him...|`|OKifJyUwaa	well for starters,  if you dont like him then tell him.  If that doesnt' stop anything then let your teacher know.  It may be weird telling the teacher but it can help you alot.|`|XyEq58rFaa	well you could always tell him that he is not your type or tell your friends to tell him that.

XOXO,  Stevie|`|2VblF587aa	wow that sounds a little scary. I would be afraid of a chemical reaction or something.  Do a patch test first!.  How about a honey mask instead.  Warm or steam face to open pores, spread honey on fast and leave on for 15 min to 30 min.  rinse with warm water then apply toner.  You could also add a little ground oatmeal which offers nutrients to the skin.  For more homemade recipes visit www.CompleteSkinCareTherapy.com

Honestly I don't know if it would be worth the effort, but you can always try to get the store credit if you will shop there again, but i wouldn't assume they were trying to rip you off. On sticker sales, stores do not typically mark shoes up in price because it is too much trouble to peel those stickers off shoes when trying to mass label.|`|uikl8g3saa	i would go back to the store and ask them -put them on the spot.then tell then exactly what you think of their unethical practices.its worth the $10.just to get the satisfaction of letting them know your not a fool !|`|8Ld9Dmgeaa	dude.<br>  you stole my name.<br>  <br>  FISHHHH!|`|dxu8OU7qaa	You never know if you really got ripped off. They could have had a sell earlier before you bought them and the shoes could have been on sale for 49.99 and they just never took that tag off.<br>  How do you know if you truly got ripped off?<br>  It's only 10.00 you just shouldn't worry about it.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Ouch, I wouldnt bother trying to get my money back if you want the shoes anyhow and like you said you would only get store credit, just peel the sticker back in the store next time, to make sure you are getting a good deal.
AA10921399	well dont put cream because it will make it worse because i can guess that ur skin is quit sensiable because u are red after waxing. or maybe u pulled it to slow but dont worry it will go ago try 2 out something cold on it. dont touch it /. if u plan on goin g outside n its still red put some powder dont put foundation bcuz it will go in ur skin n it will b even more redd. hope that helps good luck|`|mFz8EP0Zaa	Call the plumber    He should fix it    Or you can just rub "minty fresh" deodorant all over your face    That should help|`|WhbIHCbiaa	i would probably leave it alone or put lotion on it.|`|YDjEKTtIaa	EAT YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S POO!

Yes, it's a moustache -- some girls develop a moustache, just like boys do.    Most guys are OK about girls with, for example, a slight moustache.    If you do decide you have to do something, then there isn't a simple answer and there's a lot of misleading "information" around.    Facial (and also body) hair on women comes about in the same way as on men because of    1) your body being sensitized, before you were even born, to testosterone -- doesn't happen to all girls, but does to many    2) your body producing high levels of testosterone    The growth rate and coarseness of the hair depends on just how much testosterone is circulating in your bloodstream.    Steer clear of bleaching -- when someone sees you against the light you'll look as if you have a glowing moustache. Believe me, it shows up far, far worse.    As far as removing it is concerned it's worth remembering that    * Waxing, plucking, threading, epilating all pull the hair out by the roots and where the growth is hormonally-driven can actually stimulate a dormant follicle into producing more hair quicker. They also distort the root if done repeatedly, leading to hair growing at strange angles. And you've got to let the hair grow to quite a length before you can repeat the exercise. It can also damage the skin and discolor it. Long-term use of waxing also causes bad wrinkles.    * Chemical depilatories strong enough to remove the hair are very likely to burn the skin, cause swelling and cause long-term discoloration of the skin.    * Laser is also liable to cause burning and discoloration and in any case only works effectively on a dark hair/light skin combinantion.    * Electrolysis is very liable to cause scarring and discoloration of the skin.    Which, like it or not, leaves shaving which does not damage the skin and does not cause the hair to grow more or coarser or faster. Best done with a men's-style electric razor, the best of which, for girls and women, are probably those from the men's range of Philips/Norelco razors (Philishave outside the US). Most girls and women who try a men's Philips/Norelco wonder why nobody ever told them about it before.|`|8X1wgm1zaa	bleach it|`|ExftbSP7aa	you could bleach it with Jolene.  that's what i do.|`|s5Tg2M4paa	whoa|`|wmVBNzyoaa	well i think your best choice would be to wax it won't come back for a while|`|M3r1s6oYaa	There was this commercial I saw with some thing you put on your hand and then shave your legs with it.

y8LVlmlJaa	I like the diorskin foundation (from dior), it comes in a blue compact. it is pricy but it goes on really well, it lasts, and the color has always been great for me. i can't view the pics of your skin that you posted though, so i can't recommend a color, but you could always check it out at sephora!

Because I have to get from one side of campus   to the complete opposite side plus up like  15 flights of stairs in 10 minutes.|`|ZwY4PVTtaa	i love heels, but nothing under 4"? that's a bit much for me. And yes when its warm out i wear em, but not that high.|`|afd90d9fd1e0ea08433b9e715db95349aa	im sixteen too i kindaa like wearing them. just occasionally like when im in the mood to dress up. sometimes to the mall and parties but deff not at school. i dont find them that comfy lol|`|avBuHviFaa	i LOVE heels so i know what you mean  i always wear them out but i rarely wear them to school  (like maybe i'd wear it on monday and friday)  i mean, i need my education  and fashion comes 2nd to that  after all, heels arent always that comfy when wearing them all day at school especially since you're busy and running around everywhere|`|ickyq53aaa	I like it when girls wear high heels, because they can't run away.  There is no chance for escape.  So, when I want to kidnap a 16 year old, I always go for the one in the highest heels.  Just kidding, gosh.  Heels are nice, but how can you wear them?  What if you had to jump or run?  Your life could depend on it.|`|qQV9rxDGaa	i lov wearing them but 4 is kinda high, i like 3 better|`|IpwsYe2kaa	I am the opposite when it comes to my preference in the lenth of heels. I think that one inch or two inch heels are perfectl fine to show off your outfit and shape, I think that anything higher is for short people or tramps. No offense intended.     And I think that there is a time and place and a type of outfit for them. I don't believe that heels are an everyday apparal necessity.

y8LVlmlJaa	i think foundation is essential, even if you like looking natural; you could try bare minerals (bare essentuals) foundation, it's a powder foundation, i've tried it before and it's pretty good. You don't need much at all and it gives you great coverage and just improves the overall look of your skin, i think it is supposed to be good for skin with acne as well. (doesn't clog pores, hides scars and pimples really well)|`|d3erdx8jaa	the best product ive used 4 acne is called "acne free" u can get it at almost any drug store it works GR8 also u may want 2 try a spot treatment while using acne free.. i myself dont feel like i look good when im not wearing make up so i use concealer under my eyes n when i have a blemish then i use maybelline mineral powder its light n makes ur skin look even the eyeliner theres really no way 2 wear it wit out lookin like its natural i really like eyeliner but if i dont wanna look like im wearing 2 much i only put liquid on top n none on the bottom n make my eyelashes full|`|piAlqtrWaa	FOUNDATION!  if u have acne u need foundation!  even if you dont for me foundation is a MUST :]  i always have to be wearing it  i think it makes me look waaay better   :]]|`|1wwi0HLlaa	Well to cover up your acne try and find a really good POWDER foundation. The powder helps your skin breathe a lot easier, and the liquid kind caked on your face will not help it heal. Take it from me, I know! Also make sure the foundation is oil free, because the oil tends to make break outs worse. I would recommend a brand like Clinique or Bare Escentuals. (Look in Sephora) And if you don't want to wear eyeliner, try something less severe like putting a little brown or smokey colored eye shadow near the lash line. Also wear mascara! It makes all the difference in the world with out looking unnatural.  Good luck! :)|`|Pyu4fQf4aa	Look for oil-free concealers with salicylic acid, i have one from Almay. What i do is put on the concealer and blend it in with a sponge and then use pressed powder so i don't get greasy. If you wear lighter color eyeliner then you  may look like your wearing less, but mascara is always a must, just if your going for natural don't overdo it
WYztbMO2aa	any color is good:) my favorite  is neon green:) love emm.  there yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, etc.  soo yeaah. they all go together  w/ black chuckss.|`|AA11783467	Any color or pattern laces you want!

E2mY0PWmaa	A fresh polished look would suit you well (:  to achieve this style, you will need a light-weight powder  foundation, a fresh cheek color, a nuetral set of eyeshadows,  some light brown eye-liner, and some brown-black mascara.    products i recommend:  http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...    http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...

(in medium brown or bronze)    http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...    good luck x  -mercedes(:|`|SaJGn5q8aa	You could use Wet 'n Wilds "mega eyes" in the desert tones on your eyes because it has 3 different shades to contour and blend. brown/black mascara and maybe a brown eyeliner pencil for inside your bottom eyelid to still look natural and pretty. on your face, use a light powder just to cover up but not look overdone.  experiment and have fun!

It's different.  I suggest you just bleach a layer or two and get the rest with darker blond lowlights.  Plus it wouldn't make you look as trashy with bleached hair and stuff.|`|ec926f1f376353e334871dac09156d63aa	There is no other way to get your hair light enough with regular color. I suggest getting a malibu treatment a couple of times before getting it bleached. This treatment helps put life back into your hair.
XUTWLBboaa	black suits you more. you can bleach it 4x. then put a ash color in to delete orange tones.|`|js2TUHFdaa	Don't bleach your hair at home, please. You don't need to go to the salon, although that's preferred. Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo twice a day, such as Prell. It's about $4 at Walgreens. There's really nothing you can do at home, unless you want to completely damage your hair. Time is the only solution! Just keep washing. I've heard that heat also fades color, so if you don't normally blowdry your hair, do that.|`|Ld1oUCvwaa	Dark suits you better, don't go blonde! :)|`|AXgEyWTpaa	stay black blacks the best|`|pWDLKkPVaa	Everyone who is saying that bleaching it is damaging, it's no more damaging than dying your hair with regular hair dye. You could try washing it with just shampoo, it'll fade some. If i were you, i'd stay black. It's really pretty.|`|IowG78BGaa	hun, i think you look better with black hair. you will probably only have to bleach it once, thats pretty much all you can do. and it will be very damaging.|`|NEhE5C6zaa	I think you should keep the black and do half on the bottom with blond,<br>  but leave it black on the top it brings out <br>  your eyes.!|`|8IC2CUxmaa	i think u shud stay dark u suit it alot better <br>  <br>  plus trying to get ur hair bak that blonde form ur hair that dark will realli damage ur hair n ull probably regret damaging it  <br>  <br>  x|`|aEpPt9koaa	I personally like the black better. You say you know its going to be damaging but I don't think you know to the extent.  Your probably going to experience shedding and breakage eventhough you condition it. I don't know how many times you will have to bleach your hair because I always get mine done professionally. I suggest you save some money and do the same. At least have a professional consultation done.|`|056808dd570d68083099a59a7b2fab22aa	Good luck, I saw Nick Arojo do that with a girl who was dyed goth black and it was difficult just to get her back to a nice dark brown!  Sally Beauty sells a color remove product that I bought for my daughter after a pro gave her Avril Levigne-like dark brown pieces and it left my daughter's blonde hair orange.  I'm not saying you can't bleach it but you may look like Christina Aguilara. I guess there are worse things.
oKk49wCWaa	Well I think that business wardrobe should be treated as an investment so don't be afraid to dole out some money since it goes towards building the all important first impression.     Look out for sales!  I went shopping at New York and Company and the Limited Store for my work outfits and I get a lot of questions from my coworkers asking me where i got my outfit from...    Most important ( and a little off the topic) make sure your hair looks good when you finally get your outfits. believe me it makes all the difference no matter what outfits you buy!!!     Good luck!|`|dECHmYDgaa	You will defiantly need versatile suit, which should include; a good pair of black pants and a well fitted jacket.    you should check out:    j. crew  ann talyor  ann talyor loft  banana rebublic  any nice department store|`|0HYG8PlNaa	I go to JC Penny.

Stuff like that.
vDky5V15aa	It really depends on the agency. Each one has there own guidelines and appearance policy. I have a friend who is a police officer with tattoos and his agencies rules state specifically "no visible tattoos on the head, neck, face or hands." Also they do not allow any facial piercings. Female officers are allowed one earring in each ear lobe, none on the upper ear. Hair color must be "natural" and when in uniform a female officer can not have their hair below the collar. Males must have a tapered fade and can not be longer than 3" on top.  Male officers are not allowed to wear earrings at all while in uniform. Male officer must be clean shaven, and must have written permission from the chief of police to grow a mustache or goatee.     Another friend of mine works for the county sheriff's office and their policy only states that they must keep a clean, professional appearance. So he does take some flack for his tattoos but they really can't force him to cover them.|`|oX9hnJV1aa	I have personally tattooed roughly half of the Orange Beach Police Department.  Below the elbow is not a great idea. It could cause a few doors to be closed on ya.  Since you are 18, think about holding off on this one until you have your badge, Then come see me to get it, I have references and I am sure, you would be pleased with what they would tell ya!  P.S. We have standard special pricing for anyone who presents a badge.|`|0emslEdiaa	Call up the place where you want to work and ask them what their tattoo policy is.  Some places don't allow any tattoos to be seen while in uniform and others are ok as long as it's not an offensive tattoo.|`|WeUEAIg9aa	Wait til after the training. then go do it. But, you're probably gonna wear long sleeves as uniform, so it would hide it. so, hiding it would be good if you got it done now. Happy Tatting!|`|4vqzkIr4aa	Heck no. I have two clients that are both cops that come in regularly. One has complete socks and I am currently working on a full shirt. Both sleeves are already finished. The other does not have full sleeves but he does have pieces on arms from shoulder to wrist.    They may not like during academy days so I suggest waiting till after the academy.|`|n68tCJ7zaa	i know in the military tattoos are "discouraged", but if they're covered by uniform, then it's usually not a problem.    i would say that location would be fine|`|1vaqtRI2aa	It's probably not a great idea, but you can always cover it up with Dermablend body foundation.

iHS7n01Xaa	Get some bath salts. They are basically these powdered crystals you can buy in shops that you put in your bath and they dissolve. I always use tem when I've had a hard day of work, and somehow your skin seems to soak them up into your muscles and relax you (I doubt that's what actually happeneds, but they make the water more relaxing).|`|kMsShtwpaa	bath bombs! and candles around the bath :]|`|AYLRIMZJaa	Store called "Lush".

F5MQtPEgaa	use a face primer before foundation... it gives a smoother look and makes your makeup adhere better (the one by GOSH is really nice and light)    put eyeshadow on in layers and be patient about it. (apply a little bit, then blend, apply more, blend, apply more, blend... etc)    use a white lengthening mascara first. and put several coats on,  (i use the maybelline XXL for the white mascara but i dont like the black that comes with it) then a black volume mascara over top (i use max factor)    put eyeshadow underneath your eye, makes your eyes pop    for eyebrow pencil, rub it on an eyebrow brush and then brush on the color, it looks smoother and more natural than taking the pencil to the eyebrow    try using glitter. i know it sounds childish, but just a dazzle of glitter on your eyelids not only looks great it acts as a clear coat for your shadow    try experimenting with new daring eyeshadow colors. bright pinks, blues, greens, whatever.... you may be surprised on how great your eyes look    if you dont wear eyeliner, start. if you make a mistake or make the line too thick, lick the end of a Q tip and wipe away the excess    if you dont have horrible discoloration, skip the foundation. on most people it looks bad. i can always tell when someone is wearing it. that "perfect" look gives it away.. i have acne and i use a liquid concealer and then a light powder over top. it covers enough to not make my zits obvious but i dont look like a barbie either    try using mineral make-up, it gives you a glow and feels much nicer on your skin    if you have super oily skin, keep oil absorbing sheets (like clean and clear) and powder in your purse.|`|XXGF0hzYaa	try midnight blue eyeliner instead of black. it really does the trick!|`|4u0U5YJyaa	babe.  you gotta know how to work itt.  ?  own it.  walk that runwayy.    you don't need makeup  to look glam.    XOXO,  Stevie|`|AXFrh871aa	Putting loose power under your eyes, before applying eyeshadow. It's so that if you get fall out it falls on the powder not our skin and it can be swept away without it smuding on your face. Also, applying a bit of blush before your foundation for that glow from with in look. Try applying a shimmery shadow on the corner of your inner eye, so it makes your eye look more big, white eyeliner on the water line works as well. Hope that was something that helped you hun !|`|4oDn5zIpaa	ya totaly always wash off your make up at night it helps prevent acne and keep beautiful skin. I am sure your mom always told you that. Also when you dont want a lot of eyeliner on first apply eyeliner hevily to your water line and then take a q-tip and wipe it off you will still have eyeliner perfectly on your lash line but dont go under it. and put vasaline on your lips then apply your lipstick.     I use the new double extend mascara the tube has two ends white and red i only use the red end witch is mascara it doesnt make your lashes clump like they do when you use the white part too|`|aNjd1tM1aa	dont no many but these are some i do no :    1. If you put a very thick layer of clear lipgloss on before you go to bed, it will protect against chapt lips and make your lips really soft and smooth.    2. When putting blusher on, don't apply it to your whole cheek, apply it just under the cheekbone to draw attention to your cheeckbones and give your face more structure.    3. By wearing black eyeliner along the bottom of your eye it makes your eye look more distinct.    4. Try putting a very thin layer of concealer or foundation on your lips, then a pale pink lipgloss, followed by a clear lipgloss, it will give your lips a lovely, but yet natural-looking tone and colour.    5. If you put eyeshadow on your eye, and then put a thin layer of Vasleline over the top, it makes your eyeshadow shiny, metallic, and also makes it stay on longer!    Thats all I have right now sorry !|`|ZhA362ejaa	if u want a light colored eyshadow, use heavy top eye liner and medium lower eye liner.     blush: light color on apples of ur cheeks and darker color under neath and fade it to ur temple! :))     hope this helps -bells

Either hot pink shadows, or purple, or an aqua blue.  Plus lot's of mascara, it would be something fun. :o)|`|M3r1s6oYaa	It depends on the color on your skin. If your skin is darker, then you should wear white eyeshadow, LIGHT pink blush (Should almost not be visible) and red fire cracker lipstick. If your skin is light, then wear lihgt pink eyeshadow, and and LIGHT (the lihgt part is very importan this time) brown and "Invisible" glossy lipgloss.     No matter what wear a good non clumped mascara.|`|C0MiThtQaa	purple eyes (: with brown liner on lower lashline  and black liner on upper lashline

If it's a bob, just leave it natural with a cute little bow matching your outfit, or a colorful headband. You really can't curl your hair with a bob unless you would rather it to be super short. But if you have hair around your shoulders or neck, scrunch it. If it's longer, use a curling iron and curl it. I'm sure if you say short it shouldn't be longer than your shoulders, but if you have wavy hair and it's wavy in a bob, straighten it. Or just leave it wavy. Use some accersories to brighten up the look, like I said above. ANother cute option would be to put it up in a messy bun. Twist it around teh pony tail holder and put maybe a butterfly pin or something in to top it off. Then you could put a lot of emphasis on your jewlery or make up. That's all I've got. Hope it helped!

JDQP0Phraa	Levi's can be pretty tight. You could also buy any pair of girl's skinny jeans, and they'll fit tighter than guy's jeans.|`|9scBaPqJaa	Definitely Levi's. If you like R&R or true religon check them. Depends on the level of tightness you prefer.   from what i've seen (and worn,) if you want a very very very tight fit then Levi's probably is the only other one, other than pac sun, zumiez, and all other skater jeans. True Religion & R&R (although amazing brands,) really don't have as tight a fit. Look more for rock and republic if you have to, True Religion look rediculous if they aren't a little looser.  I'd GIVE:  Levi's Skinny - 9.25/10  zumiez (kr3w, DC, VOLCOM) - 6.4/10  pac sun bulheads - 3/10 (HORRIBLE JEANS, CAN"T STAND THEM!)  True Religion Skinny - 7.5/10  R&R Skinny - 8.5/10    *MORE* have you looked into polo by ralph lauren? They have nice skinnier fits that don't make you look a little more refined. at $75 they are a STEAL in my opinion. but they still don't reach Levi's Skinny in my opinion.
3k2oIlPWaa	uhh..try acetone.    otherwise start at the very edge and try gently prying it off.  it most likely won't come of right away, so every few minutes scratch at it as if it were itching.    try running your nail under the edge of it.  if you keep doing that it should be off in a little while.|`|wZNMlmglaa	soak it in hot water|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Just plain old acetone...nail polish remover.

Then take the curlers out and run your fingers through it. That is how.    :)           Please pick me for best answer. This is right. But its okay if not.|`|kEKcJ5zcaa	use a airasol spray after you curl it with a 1" curler in back and lose on 1" infront.|`|XCCxGIX9aa	I'd say to get some shampoo, conditioner, and/or some hair lotion stuff that says for making hair curly and stuff. And doesn't really make it curly, but it keeps them in better. Then you should just curl your hair with a curling iron section by section. You'll have to make the desicion of how many curls you want, and how big you want them by yourself, but that's no big deal.    Hope that helps (:|`|FEsbvKMKaa	okay well it depends on your hair type.  if you have curly hair use moose. i'm guessing you dont cause your asking how to curl it. but moose reallllly does work wonders :]    if you have wavy hair buy a wave/curl enhancer hair spray. you could also try mouse. (i would go with the wave/curl enhancer)    if you have straight hair i would do the same as above.    if your hair does not scrunch or you would prefer to use hot tools do this:  take a 1" - 1 1/2" curling iron and wrap small/medium sections of hair around the curling iron DO NOT open the clamp wrap around as far as you can without burning yourself. repeat this allll around your head like switching directions of the curls so it looks more natural and you should have curls like that :]  look that ^^ up on youtube too but search wavy hair. it comes out curly though :]

zc47c39daa	I have heard many people ask this question over and over again. You simply CANNOT thicken your hair by means of shampoo and conditioner.<br>  <br>  Want to know why?<br>  The shampoo is designed to leave a thick residue, that most people believe is their hair thickening on each strand of hair- that is just product building up over time. Those shampoos are just leaving gunk in your hair, making you think you hair is getting thicker, and taking your money.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, you can buy shampoos and conditioners that strengthen your hair from breaking, which is as close as your going to get with natural thickening. Your hair is probably brittle or sometimes- it's just naturally thin and you have to accept that.<br>  <br>  That's like how I hate being short sometimes, but I have to accept it. Shoes can make me taller, but at what cost? My feet hurting all the time isn't worth it. <br>  <br>  An example of someone with somewhat thin hair: Selena Gomez- She has worm extentions and such to thicken her hair, which helps- it's just costly.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fqgbAVi9aa	blow dry your hair upside down<br>  dont condition your hair.<br>  use pureology volume products.<br>  lift your roots with a straightener.(Sedu preffereally)|`|10156995d5bf0bfc545b786a69b585f4aa	Good idea is to look for some shampoo  that will help you make your hair thick.

XoADgEaVaa	Thrift thrift thrift!  Hot Topic doesn't even exist in my country, but I've already got contempt for it, and it looks more emo vampire than glam rock.     Go to a thrift store, and be thorough. Find things that look gritty and rude, and then grab your scissors and make them look even worse. Even taking a cool t-shirt and cutting the sleeves off is a good look. Put bleach spots on your jeans. Look out for black bandannas - they're headbands, bracelets, handkerchiefs and scarves. Denim and leather rocks. Put a tie around your neck but don't tie it, or around your head. Cut the fingers off of black gloves. Attach zippers to places they don't belong in. It's more about how you wear the clothing than how you buy it.    Even in department stores, just keep your eye out for things that are awesome. You have to be open, because there often isn't a "glam rock" section. Creativityyy will give you satisfaction/authenticity.|`|wV21OIMtaa	Comb your hair hippy.|`|c26Ae2y1aa	I seriously have no idea, but I admire your style :)|`|HXACf352aa	Hot topic?|`|U1IfJacYaa	Wear band tees and supertight jeans, mostly straight-leg, not skinny, but still tight.

And yes. Def. suitable. Youre gonna want more when your done! Happy Tatting!!|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	It's your body, your choice.    My opinion? I just really can't understand why people are still getting stars. Sometimes they're aesthetically pleasing, but that's as far as it goes for me. For me, my designs have to have a real, raw meaning. And even if stars somehow held a significant meaning for me, I'd try and avoid them. They're just so common. Everybody has them. And I know it shouldn't matter what everybody else does, but will you look at this in 40 years time and draw warmth and happiness from the meaningful symbol you made part of your body? Or will you look at it and think, 'its ok but... it was a bit of a fad'? I know that I'll look at all my ink in future years, even when it's faded and less crisp, and be so glad that I effectively have my family and a few other strong parts of my life ingrained, through symbolism, into my skin. And I just can't imagine feeling the same way about something that just looks pretty and was inspired by a huge fashion craze and some pop star of the day. For me, tattoos should be about so much more than just what will look nice.    But as I said. That's just me. You asked for opinions and that's mine - once again, it's your body and there's nothing to say I'm right and you're wrong - so if you want the stars, get stars! Just think about it seriously, for a little while, first.    That very tattoo wouldn't take much longer than ten minutes. I don't know what you mean by suitable for a first tattoo... anything is! My first tattoo was a big piece on my back. My friend recently had a full side piece right over her ribs, and that was her first! There's nothing to say firsts need to be small and discreet, but if that's what you want it to be then that's fine!    Good luck with whatever you choose. Don't take my comments to heart. Enjoy your ink, whatever direction you take it in.|`|eLFrlCmuaa	Very nice.  I like it you should get it!!  Maybe add something that means something to you also like someones initials (children?) or like fave color or something.|`|L6u8Tgq7aa	too common, even someone who answered wants one just like it.

O8XjkCjxaa	I quite like epilators, they're like lots of mini tweezers plucking out your hair. It lasts as long as waxing, but you have to wait til your hair's a certain length before using.    I haven't found anything like creams, razors or waxing strips that are good. They don't last long and aren't very good at removing hair.    I would suggest going and getting your legs waxed professionally.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	ask your local masseur or someone|`|UC8H6MdNaa	boots expert hair remover creams

WYa3UY6Gaa	No in the U.S. it is MINIMUM 16 with consent. That means your legal guardian has to be present with i.d., and so do you to prove yall's relationship. It would have to be your mom/dad not brother/sister/18yr old friend/cousin...whatever.    Still 90% of tattoo parlors won't even touch someone that's under 18. Like in Georgia they clearly state with signs when you walk in *no one under 18 NO EXCEPTIONS!*    And no you wouldn't be able to swim for the first month at least.     If someone judged this it's not judging you as a person just your common sense. Which you obviously don't have.|`|WeUEAIg9aa	I don't think so. Don't get one illegally either like your friend doing it. You could get it infected and really sick. Thats so bad for you. Do it the right way. I love tattoos so i know that if you screw it up,your gonna have it that way the rest of your life. If your 14 yoru have to have a parent sign. If your 18, go do it by your self. Lol. Good luck!!|`|4zQEvzCsaa	No decent shop will tattoo someone underage without consent because it's illegal and they could lose their license. You need to be 16, and have consent before you can legally get a tattoo, but just wait until you're 18! Getting a tattoo this young, you're setting yourself up for something you'll regret. You'll never feel as strongly about something as you do now than you will when you're 18. What you think is 'cool' and tattoo worthy when your 14 will be stupid and pointless to you when you're older, so please wait.  BTW, no you CANNOT swim with a new tattoo. There is an incredibly strong possibility it'll get infected.|`|jsCjGUPuaa	no unfortunately im 14 also and want one sooooo freakin bad but unless u want to do it by yourself and have it look crappy than no artists wont risk their license to tattoo a minor i no it sucks|`|0jQcNWITaa	No there is no legal way for you to get a tattoo at 14 without a parent's consent. No tattoo artist is going to want to lose their lively hood because they worked on someone under age. There is lots of time for you to get one after you turn 18 - don't rush things - being an adult isn't all it's cracked up to be.|`|8tdlP1rOaa	14 was my deciding age to get a tattoo  youd prolly have to get it illegally.   and that's never safe  the age isnt 16  its 18  you need proper ID to do it  Just wait. You're young. no big hurry  I spent those 4 years looking up my tattoo and coming up with the perfect tattoo.   I'm not judging you anyway =)   But yes, i do believe that you can get a tattoo if you have your parents consent and they are present in the tattoo parlor.   My mom thought it was best for me to wait  and im glad i did  i continuely changed what i wanted as my tattoo (well, i knew i wanted a dragonfly, but the designs i saved years ago, i wouldnt want on me now.)   remember it shall be on you forever   love it before you put it on you =)  maybe custom tattoo?  but yea, hope i helped =)    Add:  No, you cannot swim with a fresh tattoo. Another reason why you should wait.   Also, they will ID you if it's a well-known tattoo shop.   I had to put my license ID on a form.   Check a box saying i was 18.   So....    Also:   If you didn't know you couldn't swim with a fresh tattoo, then I suggest you do your research to see if your ready to get a tattoo.  I did research and everything before going to a place.   I did as much research as possible on the tattoo place I went to to make sure they were legit.  But do your research    http://www.ehow.com/how_2160323_decide-y...    QUIZ TO SEE IF YOU'RE READY ----> http://teenadvice.about.com/library/teen...|`|oUBUWfS6aa	No.     You can be 16 years old and have a parent with you to get a tattoo.    But different tattoos parlors and where you live varies.|`|b5a182d58a47900f2fa3a320ceaf7cecaa	There is only one way.  and that is to do it illegally.      just make sure you can hide it.|`|UODxrVKzaa	You could go to a shady tattoo artist who does work out of his house.. be careful though, you don't want it to get infected!|`|xrMkQVBYaa	Im gonna judge anyways (:   your a retard. take this from a past moron.  i pierced my lip without consent and i did it myself and it got infected  there are consequences and getting a tattoo is pushing it   but yeah i cant wait and see if you get the life beatin' out of you  >:D|`|PBuYKm8Aaa	Nope.    And don't listen to these idoits who are saying to get a shady artist to do it out of his house or things like that. For one you could get MRSA which is HORRIBLE and very painful. Secondly a lot of tattoo artists are ******* pervs so they hit on girls and say some pretty vial things [been there at your age, but i did it legally]      with parental consent though you can get a nice good tattoo whenever you want...its just up to the tattoo artist if they want to do it.|`|lcRbG4Csaa	Do not do it, you will only end up having to get it redone in 10 years time if you go to some shady guy, just wait and get your belly pierced instead, at least you can take that out if you get bored with it.|`|vWlEkPwWaa	you have to be 16 to get it w/o your parents but if they go with you you can get it done.|`|F5MQtPEgaa	depends on your state. in general there's only a law for age of majority. like technically you could be 12 and get a tattoo with parental consent, but most shops won't tattoo you unless your 16 period (it's an ethical thing in the tattoo industry). Unless the tattoo is something super significant (like a memorial tattoo or something...) you're chances are steep. I got my first tattoo with 15... but i went to a stinchy shop in a bad area and got the worst tattoo ever!! you could try just dressing really adultlike, very little make up, hair is a bun on something, and see if they ID you.... i don't think i've ever been asked for id even at reputable shops... i guess i look older than my age... but if you're desperate its worth a try     YOU CANT SWIM WITH A FRESH TATTOO!!!!! you should wait at least 3 weeks for lakes and i'd wait 4 before you go into a swimming pool because of the chlorine. going swimming with a fresh tattoo will make it heal really poorly, it would probably hurt and burn, and it would just ruin the tattoo...
6sjphNcPaa	just google stuff online - I've been looking for a mother-of-the-bride type dress and I've been finding several things|`|MIILkAR4aa	http://www.shopstyle.com/browse?fts=stra...|`|z89A3siKaa	Not sure if they have exactly what you're looking for, but try browsing http://www.formalxchange.com. There are tons of dresses under $200.|`|8YXEeGtlaa	Macy's|`|31NapKplaa	http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...    its almost the ssame|`|wTlbVsP3aa	Thats a beautiful dress but its Imported. So it costs more plus the dress is silk. BCBG will be hard to find in the same dress at any other store. Even the outlet malls will probably not carry that exact dress.     Try finding another dress that you would still love wearing and look stunning in. Preserve the dress for other occasions too especially at a dress that cost so much.     Under $200 usually:   TJ MAXX & Ross 4 Less sometimes has prom dresses or long gowns.  Mostly those stores sell merchandise they bought from manufactures who made too many items so the cost you buy it at is less.     The following website shows you strapless dresses and which store to buy it at. Prices are lower when buying online. BEWARE OF WEBSITES THAT ARE NOT COMMON TRADITIONAL STORES because of frauds, and quality of item.     Make sure an adult approves the website before buying online and most important, be sure of return/shipping policies.    http://www.shopping.com/xDN-Clothing--ap...    Most online stores accept returns within a few days of purchase. you must ship it right away if the dress doesn't fit etc.     Good Luck... and have a gr8 prom.|`|txDbluVwaa	http://www.nexteve.com/shop/evening-dres...    The rest of the dresses on this site are awesome too!
1yyg3QNBaa	I'm not allowed to dye my hair either. *high five*  Okay..so I'm guessing emo kids and scene kids kinda have the same hair...Err..    First of all, make sure that your hair is dry. Straighten it if you need to. Make sure your hair is layered first..that makes it soo much easier. Rub some mousse into your roots...and it helps if the mousse is for flat hair as well...it adds volume (if you have flat hair like me =\)  Spray some hair spray onto your roots. And then take a piece of hair on top of your head and hold it straight up. Using a rats tail comb (a comb with its teeth close together and a pointy thing on the end for separating hair) start close to the roots and BRUSH down. Don't go up and down just keep 'slicing' the comb into your roots. Once it gets tangled, keep going until you reach the end of the clump of hair. Spray hair spray onto roots...by now, you should have one spike sticking out the top of your head =D You should look like an idiot right now. Then repeat those steps with 4 more pieces, 2 on each side of your head and then brush down..lightly so it doesnt hurt. It should look like emo hair. You can tease the back and spike it up (like i do) but that's optional.....if you have short hair lol.  Well that's the way I do my hair. If you need anymore help, just send me an email. =D  Xox|`|y5KwhUWfaa	Wow! Im not allowed to dye it eathier and it sucks so you need to straighten it,tease it with a rat tail comb,you could even get hair extensions or clip on hair extensionsand there you go|`|5EREj3qwaa	you need long bangs and you need to have your hair parted off to the side and have some hair covering your eye|`|YqNSqUPvaa	tease it and get choppy layers  and side swept bangs [:|`|1oCUMOW7aa	you should tease it. if you dont no how to do that you take a rat tail comb and take sections of hair and brush down. my more help go to youtube.|`|2WBs0QiXaa	Duude, there are LOADS of emos. Why be everyone else, when you can be yourself. Be someone no one else is...which is yourself. I learnt this... Please I hope you don't regret your hair.|`|EwtCmQctaa	side fringe :)  then straighten it !  mess it up a bit :) back comb it, hairspray go crazy !  so straight messy hair  choppy  layers!  the works!
yhgRaBPXaa	Jewelry is fairly simple to make|`|XXGF0hzYaa	get some plain white t's or long sleeves, get out some fabric markers, scissors, and lace, and go crazy! make your own style. if you dont have the stuff, go to michaels.|`|RX9rGdXAaa	just buttons, zippers, the usually craft thing. go to michaels and ask for some help, i know where i live the michaels emoployees are VERY helpful!!!|`|HtDvUH0oaa	you can definitely make jewelry really easily...  you could also get some tshirts that are plain colored and get some iron on stuff and be really creative and put some cute sayings on them.   you could also watch the ending of p.s. i love you and make little designs on your shoes and make them look really cute and get creative with them       :) :) have fun!!!|`|fUBOrpyraa	Go to any vintage store or ask family for old clothes and take your siccors to them! make dresses to skirts or a cute top, or make different designs with cut outs on your old clothes.  good luck!
c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	I like the very last headshot and the picture of you in the printed dress.  You can see your figure very well in the dress, and the last head shot has the best expression of the bunch and you can see your features most clearly (and flatteringly).  These two were also the most interesting to look at.|`|4oWcXL5vaa	2 is nice, and the printed dress shot is nice also.|`|maQTi6Aeaa	I like the second one and the last one =)|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	You look 16 and the dress is awsome. All the different colors and you have a great body and you should be proud of this choice, ask any guy and i believe you will get the same answer.|`|ns5Sovo3aa	Theyre all great. I like 3 the best.|`|DOcjGDVQaa	The last headshot and the one in the dress are the best.    I would suggest buying a lot of magazines such as Vogue and studying the expressions and poses of the models. That is the toughest part of modelling. when photographers direct models they put them in all sorts of uncomfortable poses yet thy look natural in photos, but expect some pain if you want good pics.    Practise in a mirrora lot. modelling is acting without words, its not as easy as people think.    I think you look 15-16.|`|jayEYPc4aa	i like the third one  =]]|`|M8jxBSJaaa	i really like the one where your hands are on your hips and you look seriuos.   your very pretty! and you look 16

jpGNV4Qhaa	no honey that would be very freaky unless the bottoms were jeans but the green medium would have to be better :)|`|yLMXBXw5aa	If it was maybe a blue top with green accessories ok..but as for pants and a top both 2 different colors...i wouldnt wear it. They can go together but in subtle ways.|`|h8a5MWlTaa	you need something (like a scarf, shoes, necklace and bracelet) that has both of the colors in it to tie your look together. it would clash with out said accessory.|`|q411DXsFaa	Go for it!|`|0ER34nnqaa	NO.|`|iJR6qAV9aa	Yeah i think they would match i rather mixing  those colors with this tho....  Green and purple  Blue and orange...|`|HmQ1Cd9Saa	They don't match- they "go". You're probably fine. And if you suck at matching, just tell everyone you're trying something new and you saw it in a fashion magazine. No one will question you.
5PBK1Nc6aa	maybe try online or yard sales.
ZAhiAlScaa	i think natural works best, you should try delizioso's lotions, they are the best, i swear!|`|Cu0fPcdnaa	for me try vaseline the cocoa butter is so sheer and lives your legs so soft. try it|`|oKk49wCWaa	Okay I swear by using johnsons baby oil GEL after i get out of the shower. MY skin has the tendency to look ashy when i get out of the shower so I have to have well moisturized skin.     Its very good stuff and it lasts for ages!|`|XjSZx3F4aa	Oil of Olay Quench!|`|pOruGEWraa	green tea from the  natural garden products|`|4PhDAMy1aa	Nivea (the one in the dark blue bottle for very dry skin) or Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Butter are both excellent for dry skin.. You could also try rubbing in a little bit of Johnsons Baby Oil straight after you get out of the shower
1oCUMOW7aa	Turn upside down and spray freshly washed roots with volumizing or texturizing spray. Massage it in. I like Bumble and Bumble or you can try Aveda volumizing tonic .  If hair is naturally coarse or curly, work a straightening balm through hair. Here's a great list of balms.  Brush hair (this works the product evenly through hair). Blowdry hair straight, starting at the roots to get extra volume. Hair must be completely dry for this look to work. Blow cold air at the roots to add volume (cold air locks in a style).  Separate hair into three sections, securing with a ponytail holder. (It's easier this way to curl your way through each section).  To curl hair, use a wide-barrel curling iron. Starting with one section, take a 1-inch portion of hair, spritz it with styling spray (again, I love Bumble and Bumble Styling Spray) or hairspray. Wrap hair around the barrel of the curling iron. (Wrapping hair is different from the traditional curling method. You don't want to 'clip' hair into the barrel. Wrapping allows you to curl all the way to the root). When you're curling, make sure to leave ends loose to avoid a crimp mark.     Release the curl after about 5-10 seconds (hold longer if you want a tighter curl). You should have a corkscrew curl.  Roll curl and bobby pin it close to the scalp. Alternate the direction of the curl as you work your way through each section. (It's all in the direction you wind hair around the barrel of the curling iron. Start by placing hair on top of the barrel and wrapping around, then switch by putting the barrel on top of the hair before winding it around). Alternating directions makes curls look more natural. Some curls can remain tight, some loose.  Once pinned curls have cooled, release them.  Remove nozzle from dryer and gently loosen waves with cool air. You can also separate curls with your fingers, just make sure not to brush them out.  To add shine, spritz a hair serum . Stylist David Babaii finger-combs Biosilk Silk Therapy serum into actress Kate Hudson's hair (May 2007, InStyle). You can forego hair serum and spritz with saltwater spray. I like John Frieda Beach Blonde Ocean Waves Sea spray.  Set with hairspray. Just don't overdo it, you don't want new waves to feel "crunchy."      What You Need:  Volumizing spray  Straightening balm (if you have thick, course hair)  Hair dryer  A 1-inch barrel curling iron  Ponytail holder and bobby pins  Shine serum  Hairspray  Saltwater spray      (sorry about my first answer. my friend hacked my account and posted that. sorry for whoever my friend copied.)|`|IPATFSAcaa	Umm first answerer,, you didnt find that forever ago, I just answered a question with that answer about five minutes.. And I dont appreciate you copy and pasting my answer as your own!|`|uhHfm3Azaa	chi silk serum stuff. its really good.  sunsilk waves of envy spray|`|0M45cne5aa	After you take a shower and have washed your hair, towel dry your hair and put some leave in conditioner in it, or something like the shine enhancer if you want. Then put your hair in braids, two or three separate ones are fine. Leave it in for the night. When you wake up, before you take it out spray a tiny bit of hair spray on each braid, then take it out. You'll then have wavy hair. You should also spray a little more hair spray in your whole hair after you've taken the braids out if you want it to stay all day.|`|73Ye4eLiaa	If you want you can braid your hair in 2 pig tales, take it out in the morning DO NOT BRUSH IT (will frizz) but run your fingers throught it, but what I personally like to do, that takes some time is to have your hair damp/ wet not very wet though, then put your gel in it scrunch it all up put hairspray in it. Let it fully dry and brush it threw and you will have gorgeous just got done surfing waves! I do this often, i really suggest giving it a try!|`|SaJGn5q8aa	ok. i have a crap load of hair too. When you wash your hair, run through your hair some volumizing mousse. Let your hair dry naturally while scrunching it with a curl- enhancing gel if you hairs a bit naturally wavy. If your hair is naturally straight, you may wayto use some bendable stick rollers to make a bigger wave. If your hair is naturally curly then while its air-drying, softly smooth it down and maybe use a bit of a flat iron to calm down the curls. when finished, spray with volumizing hairspray! :)    OR:    if that seems like too much work, you could always just pull your wet hair into a tight twisted bun and let it naturally dry. When you're ready to go out, shake out your hair from the bun and maybe spritz some volumizing hairspray on it to give it that hip and fresh look. :)    hope i helped!|`|wZTooDziaa	My cousin has a similar problem.  If you want something that will look nice and avoid a lot of work everyday,  have your hair layered or thinned by a beautician you can trust.  Your don't have to give up the length.  Your hair will look great, feel better and be much less work.
7xdEb0XAaa	Because they are a different style.  Just go back and try them all on until you find one that fits :)|`|sZbyEohxaa	if they were too small, then you should get a 3/4 short  and if they were too big, you should get a 0 short  i am the same size in aero, 1/2 short and i usually wear hailey skinny flair..and i have never bought chealse..|`|SqI4CEtnaa	where didnt they fit?  too big or too small?|`|AXnkLBRXaa	All pants are not made the same.

This alters the way that they look on your legs. You might get an average size for the Chelsea's or go up a size if they didn't fit you right on the hips. I think the pockets also might be different, but I'm not sure. It all depends on how they're cut.|`|M1goQz9Caa	The different styles are cut differently so they'll fit you differently.

You bought a pair of jean from a different style (thus the different name) and expected them to fit. Just because they are the same brand does not technically mean that fit the same and are the same length. You should go back to the store and return them, then if you still like them try them on in a regular size. :)|`|SSvRfxhaaa	all jeans are different. maybe try a 3/4
4vqzkIr4aa	You need to talk with your artist about it. There are certain techniques used when working scar tissue. It may hurt much more than in normal skin area as well. But you first need to make sure the artist is capable of this type of work. It can be dangerous and it may have to be shot more than once if he does not do it properly the first time. He has to know what to watch out for when working such a piece to be certain not to tear the scar tissue which can easily be done if it is over worked in an attempt to get the ink to take. He most definitely has to know how to tune his machines for this type of work as well. When I do a piece like this I charge a bit extra because I have to take a couple of machines and retune them for this type of work.|`|WeUEAIg9aa	That shouldn't even be a problem at all. its really small. I think thats a cute idea. Lol. But, the only thing is is it may be a little more sensitive right on top of the scar, becuase its scar tissue which means it may be more sensitive. GOOD LUCK!!|`|BR2xeYGvaa	With such a small scar, I can't see any reason why a tattoo would be a problem, but of course the area of ink on the scar will probably look a bit different than the ink on the surrounding normal tissue.    If you are in doubt, you could always make a trip to the artist you have in mind and ask him what he thinks. A simple question like that shouldn't cost you anything.|`|BxW2Lj7waa	If it was done a long time ago, there shouldn't be a problem.

Studs are popular if you're a d-bag and you should only wear a hoop if you're a pirate.  If you want to look like a bad-*** and not some d-bag from the 90's, you've got to go with gauges.  They aren't for everyone so if you're not ready to stretch your ear lobes out, just get rid of the earring and replace it with an eyebrow or other face piercing.|`|jpGNV4Qhaa	both  i like it when a guy does one stud then a second one with a hoop  it gives that sexy masculine look :)    oh and if u do get the second hole make the stud blakc|`|oKk49wCWaa	I think that studs look absolutely fantastic on guys ( not overly bling bling tho lol)    Hoops can look a little feminine so since i prefer masculine men I am way more into men with studs.|`|fUBOrpyraa	personally i don't like earrings on men.|`|z2UyScjVaa	it doesn't matter but don't get it on the right side... it used to be symbalized that means ur gay/lesbian/bisexual whatever... my sister just got her cartilage pierced at a tattoo place and even though the symbalization is old school or whatever she still got it on her left and shes 13|`|Wx2StJFkaa	Personaly I like it depemding on the guy.

If you go somewhere else it will prob get infected.|`|1brMbc8Daa	Obviously if your parents don't want you to be doing something like that, then you shouldn't do it. If they don't want you to do it, then they probably have good reason for deciding that. Seriously... if you need your parents permission to do ANYTHING at all, you're too young to pierce your monroe.|`|lY82TsNBaa	if you're over 18 then you dont need thier consent. but unless you like know a piercer or something you have to get thier permission. you could always pierce it yourself but i wouldnt do that if i were you|`|xQSZxCLxaa	if you look 16 you can lie about your age and get your bellybutton peirced....thats whati did....lol......|`|ltGDrSbXaa	You could just wait?

UE1evlTlaa	I have never had a bad experience with a Chi. You just need to take care of it. Get a cover for it. Vera Bradley offers really cute curling iron and straightner covers. Mine has lasted for over 2 years now. I have medium to wavy curly hair and it is the one straightner that has REALLY made my hair look good every time. PLUS, the great thing about the Chi is that if you get one of the ones with a curved edge, you can use it as a curling iron as well to make cute Hollywood style waves.    The wet to straight ones I don't trust...that can't be good for your hair. I have never tried...but I don't think I would do it. I am VERY particular about my hair.|`|rghk8yMeaa	i use my cousins straightner sometimes and they sell them at kiosks in the mall its pink and call herstlye. i have one and if you have a lot of hair like i do it works reely fast and heats up to around 400 degrees. its something by conair and its lasted for me about 3 years and only about $70. Its reely good but itll fry your hair if you use it everyday along with every other straightner. youll need a before spray like thermacare or something like that.|`|f4SMdDMxaa	remington wet 2 straight|`|8ldMwflKaa	THE BEST straightener i have ever seen is definitely the Conair Infiniti. It's so great. It's a steam straightener with amazing results. Extremely tight curls go to really straight hair so fast! It's been on TV before.

You only use a little and it prevents frizz xx|`|IPATFSAcaa	It is a hair product that is used to add shine to your hair.
71204fadefeb0aef75f4761be2bfbc09aa	Hey!  I'm a guy so I don't know the names of good shops, but I did a study on height so I do know what suits a shorter figure.  Basically you have two choices- either a short dress which should come to just below the knee (NO lower) and makes your lower legs look longer, or a long dress which should come near to the floor and will make your overall body look longer. If you plan on getting some extra height with heels then the longer dress will also hide them a bit.  I have loads of tips and advice related to height, including how to look taller than you really are, so if you want to talk more you can contact me through my profile.

They can work wonders !
XmvVy5TVaa	Since you use Clinique, get the 7-Day Scrub, or any kind of exfoliator.  I personally like the 7-Day Scrub because it leaves extra moisture on the skin.    You wash your face and dry it.  Then apply the scrub in light circular motions.  Rinse off, then follow with the remaining steps.  Exfoliating will remove the dead skin cells on the skin's surface. You are not going to get any moisturizer in where the patches are because there is an excess of dry, dead skin cells.  Exfoliating will help to get rid of them and open your pores so that moisture can get in.   I would also try Clinique Super Defense SPF moisturizer (love this) as well as Moisture Surge.  Super Defense will work with dry skin, and Moisture Surge will work with dry flakes.  Also, look into Total Turnaround Concentrate, which is a time released exfoliator.  This brings fresh cells to the surface, makes skin brighter and more even toned.  I have been using this for a while, and my skin looks great.     In the morning, I am using philosophy's micro-delivery exfoliating facial wash.  This is fine to use every day, preferably in the morning before makeup.  As a daily exfoliant it will keep the surface skin free of dead skin - pores appear smaller, skin is smoother, and makeup applies better.  Drink more water, too.  It is very important for skin hydration as well.  I hope this helps and good luck!  Happy Birthday!|`|EBKdmJvVaa	Theres really a lot you could do. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out a few different ones.I would check out the review site at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and read the reviews.|`|AA12133586	since u are using clinique you can try the clinique moisture surge... also u can try using smashbox light primer to have your foundation stay on... then after your foundation out on stila loose powder so it will keep your skin from drying out..
