What if you don't have health insurance?  You can hear the doctor's receptionist now...."Will that be cash or credit?"<br>  <br>  3.  Men are strong...the backbone of the family.

T3MVUbg0aa	Rest is the best treatment for shin splints. For immediate relief use the R.I.C.E. treatment method for controlling pain and inflammation. Returning to activity must be done gradually with non-weight bearing activity (cycling, swimming) to your workouts until pain-free.<br>  <br>      * Strengthening and stretching exercises are helpful. The ankle injury rehab program can also be used for shin splint rehab.<br>      * Tape your shins to reduce stress<br>      * Weat proper footwear<br>      * Replace shoes as needed. <br>  <br>  Returning to activity must be done gradually or you risk re-injury.

w9AHaAl3aa	When are you going to let them heal, grow and become stronger?  Your overtraining them!  They need 36 to 48 hours of rest between stimulation in order to recuperate.   You should do them every other day.   Muscle tissue breaks down with resistance training, and builds up with rest and proper nutrition/diet.  OVERTRAINING is the #1 mistake beginners make in trying to strive for their 'ideal' body.  Your bodyfat should be @ 8-10% for them to pop out.  Cardio will bring down your bf.  Do 45-60 mins 5 times a week to get it down if its high.|`|LLSgQe2caa	First of all, you are believing a common myth that brings frustration to many people. This so called "six-pack" is a false idea, because guess what? You already have a six-pack! It is just under a layer of fat. Situps, no matter how many you do, simply aren't going to work. Although they strengthen your core, they do absolutely nothing in getting rid of fat near the stomach. You can't just make fat in one area disppear. Your body just doesn't work that way, as you can't choose where your body burns fat. In fact, it burns it evenly all throughout your body. So, the only way make your six pack emerge from underneath the fat is to reduce your entire body fat percentage. Excercises (especially cardio) and good nutrition are the only way to go in achieving this goal. Once you actually achieve your desired look, however, you can use situps to improve the look of your six-pack, but remember, doing ab excercises does not make your six pack emerge. And instead of situps, which are very ineffective, do excercises like the ones on this website:  <a href="http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abex...</a>|`|4bb1eb18a92334252fe30438387e6be6aa	No matter how may sit-ups you do, if you carry your fat in your abdominal region, it won't make a difference because the muscles will be covered with a layer of fat.  If you believe this is your case, aerobic exercise for at least 30-45 minutes 5 days a week will help to shed excess fat.  It is also important to watch out for foods that are likely to bloat your stomach and make sure you are drinking a lot of water.  Also, without a doubt you have to watch your calorie intake and the amount of fat and carbs you are taking in.|`|MdS7vDr7aa	It will certainly develop your abdominal muscles.  But you won't get that six-pack look if you still have belly fat.|`|yzbG8823aa	the fact that you are doing 1000 situps a day is impossible unless you are not doing your situps properly and i would highly advise you to stop doing situps because it will strain your back when you get older. It is supposed to take you 2 seconds going up and 4 seconds going down and your body will naturally max out around 50 per set. You should do 3 sets a day with 1 minutes breaks in between. Also, doing situps alone won't help. You should work out your abs on the sides and lower abs too. Lookup how to do russian twists and leg raises also. You HAVE to also run for 30 minutes every other day. Running consecutively will also burn muscle not just fat so don't do that. Erm crunches are better then situps btw.
6ac318a0d5cf80ed85ecf3a1a7c192a0aa	I used to be on Paxil and i found that no matter how much i excercised or no matter how healthy i ate i still gained weight. My doctor told me that the drug increases you're appitite so there is no way really to not gain any weight. But you can control how much you gain...just by controlling you're food intake, even if you are hungry. Just remember, you're not always hungry, sometimes it's the medication making you think that you are. Do daily excercise for 30 minutes each day. It can be as simple as just walking or jogging. Or you could go to the gym.<br>  Good luck : )|`|884972720ac1996712668502528056aaaa	See consumer info below :

zUbEybPlaa	I can identify with what you're describing... as someone living with panic/anxiety disorders, when i feel physically ill in any way, my anxiety increases. i tend to overly focus on my body and am "hypervigilant" about any symptoms that my body is going awry so that feeds into my anxiety. i am trying to learn that my body can fall ill but i don't need to fear it or worry about it... it's a long road!|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	It's possible because when you're sick, you probably don't eat as well as you should. Or you might rely on sugary foods like juice and ice cream because they feel good and sugar and a poor diet can greatly increase anxiety. <br>  You might have an iron deficiency, too.|`|p4ckQirzaa	I also tend to get pretty anxious when I get sick. It's not fun, but the good thing is that I always know it will go away as I start to feel better. I don't know what the reason is, but I think maybe the body is using up all it's energy trying to fight the sickness, like you said, making it more prone to anxiety.
QcMnfHMtaa	dont eat for a few hours before|`|yzbG8823aa	When you puke, the next time you do puke, you will puke instinctively. This is because you have trained your body to puke when you first puked. In other words, the next time you feel like puking, suck it in and even swallow your own vomit as it goes up your throat or this will keep happening.<br>  <br>  The reason you're puking is probably dehydration, you ate too close to the race, or the food you eat before the race is not keeping your body in good condition for running.|`|eeu2MOTsaa	I've never heard of that happening to someone who was in shape.

He pressed the joints of my jaw and told me to bite down, and asked me if I heard a click.  He then told me that I had a slight overbite.|`|245ccb18486b9ec8bfc2f246458b4fe8aa	mine used to do that, but it went away after like a year. if it doesnt go away, it might be lockjaw, see a doctor|`|AA10162145	When you swallow? or when you chew?  If you mean when you chew - more than likely it is TMJ.  If you are referring to the "clicking" you hear when you swallow - that is just the re-adjustment of pressure in your middle ear.  There is a part of your ear called the Eustachian tube that normally opens every time you swallow in order to equalize pressure inside your ear.  That's what you hear when you swallow.  It's not actually in your jaw at all - just close by so it may sound that way.|`|zDdINxsUaa	your jaw is out of alignment<br>  chew gum.<br>  i really don't know what else to tell you to do.strengthen your jaw muscles and aligning them by chewing gum is my only suggestion.chew on the side that cracks.when you swallow.to strengthen it.and  align the jaw. .good luck,.|`|AA11591142	It means you have clickjaw.|`|6a2ba29722a51e76794888b42e466eb1aa	It's TMJ, Temporo-Mandibular Joint (TMJ), the joint where the the lower jaw ...

I too get panic attacks and I also suffer from agorophobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, severe post-traumatic stress disorder, etc, etc, etc. I am 28 years old, and for most of my adult life I was barely  able to function. Last summer I tried medicinal marijuana and it has been the miracle I've been praying for. It has helped soooo much with all of the above conditions, and I now feel like I'm starting to live, rather than just struggling to survive. I smoke/vaporize &/or eat marijuana regularly throughout the day, now, and I no longer feel "stoned" when I do it, unless I really overdo it, or haven't had any in a few days. When I start feeling anxious, I have some and all of a sudden I can think rationally again, and see my problems in a more realistic light. It isn't the most socially accepted medicine, yet, but if you are serious about getting your life back, I urge you to try it. I must warn you DO NOT USE MARIJUANA WHILE ON PROZAC!!! Several years ago, while on prozac, I smoked some pot and became extremely agitated and paranoid. If you are taking any drugs, currently, I would advise you to do some research on drug interactions before using marijuana.  For people with anxiety disorders, it is best to avoid sativas. Only use indica's and indica-dominant crosses. Don't beleive what people say about marijuana being unsafe. Marijuana is one of the least toxic drugs, even safer than aspirin, and nobody has EVER died from a marijuana overdose. Even the U.S. government does not deny that you would have to smoke 1500 pounds of pot in 15 minutes to o.d.! Many parents are now realising marijuana is a safer, more effective alternative to Ritalin, and I have heard of people giving it to children as young as six, with fantastic results.<br>  It's definitely different than other anti-depressants in that the effects are much more pronounced, which takes some getting used to, but unlike other anti-depressants, it actually works WONDERFULLY and has no nasty side-effects, well, except the munchies. If you live in Canada, it's nearly impossible to get exemption (a license so you can smoke pot, legally), but at least in Canada the cops turn a blind eye to marijuana use, so long as you aren't trafficking, or causing problems. You don't need exemption to obtain high-quality medicinal marijuana. You can join a compassion club with a confirmation of diagnosis (for some illnesses), or in some cases a reccomendation from your doctor. If you are in BC, I reccomend the BC Compassion Club Society. From what I understand, the law is much tougher on pot smokers who don't have a license, but it is also easier to get such a license in the US. (Of the more than one-million medicinal marijuana users in Canada, currently, only around 1500 are legally exempt!) I don't know too much about getting medical marijuana in the states, but I watched this short documentary the other day about one young American woman's quest for medical marijuana. It is entitled "How I got a Medical Marijuana Recommendation" and can be found at: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJTRa2c5d9Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJTRa2c5d...</a> <br>  <br>  I hope this information helps, and if you have any questions, please feel free to email me.|`|RgsJ6YlFaa	I also suffer from panic attacks.I have been diagnosed with panic disorder mine seems to get worse at night not sure why I'm seeing a therapist who has helped me lots still not over them but things are better than they were but i didn't see any relief until i seen someone for help i also have derealisation especially when I'm having an attack hate that part so much and the feeling of no control and being scared for no real reason. but 1st thing you should do is seek some help talking to a professional it really does help you may need medicine also but a doctor can help you with this there are breathing and relaxation techniques they also help try not to worry about your exams so much your just adding to your stress and if you can relax more you probably would do better.i hope you get to feeling better soon i know how you feel and your not alone..|`|zUbEybPlaa	i started having my first panic attachs in 8th grade... one thing that has really helped me is deep breathing. often when we're anxious, stressed, we subconsciously hyperventilate. if you can learn to take deep breaths from your abdomen and release the air slowly (four seconds intake, 8 seconds outtake) i think this will take away a lot of the symptoms you are experiencing. just know you're not alone and that things will get better for you!|`|zsx4L2Hhaa	im 13 and i was exactly the same! i had them everyday and i didnt know what to do and they got worse and worse. i had the feelings too where i thought i was in a dream and everything i did it wouldnt matter if it was good or bad because i thought i was dreaming. i had the derealisation in my own house too but the thing to remember when you panic is to stay calm as much as possible. relax and count to 10 as you breathe in and count to 10 as you breathe out. tell yourself this WILL pass. <br>  im take zoloft for my depression and its wonderful! and im taking nadolol to balance the chemicals in my brain. the zoloft and nadolol  for me worked together to fight the panic attacks and anxiety. carry some water or a drink (not soda) with you and when you start panicing drink some. try as much as possible not to leave the place where youre panicing. you want to over come the fear. i still every once in a while get the feeling of im in a dream but i trust in God and i know its the devil that wants to bring me down. <br>  you can do it.<br>  i see a therapist and my school counselor and it helps tremendously! i would highly suggest therapy.<br>  i know you might have already but tell an adult how you feel.<br>  <br>  just remember, youre not going through this alone.
AA11144058	Nelson, the first thing to gaining control over your anxiety attacks is making changes in your life. It sounds like you are well on your way to getting a handle on things. But a crucial part of being successful is thinking successfully. If you committ yourself to making those lifestyle changes you can't do anything but succeed!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, I know you can do it!|`|d4f18a9e043bec96fbf8a5e33e9628eeaa	You can go get cognitive behavioral therapy to learn to recognize, cope, and effectively deal with panic/anxiety and or read self-help books on the subject. You can re-train your brain and body to respond differently so as to manage stress and anxiety permanently without meds. Do not mix herbs with prescription drugs without checking for drug interactions. Make sure your doctor knows you have added herbs to your treatment plan. Have you considered a mood stabilizer? Talk to the prescriber, get a good therapist, and you will not fail. By the way, there is a new drug called Chantix that is proven very effective for smoking cessation. You may still need your anxiety medication while getting through withdrawal, so don't stop it abruptly. Celexa is gradually increased to 40 mg daily. It may bring about mania if you have bipolar disorder. See your doctor. I am glad you want to take control of your life and very positive that you can do it. Get the skills and the rest will follow. Best of health and life to you.|`|1d33fb210b5e0eb15d1fc636b6290a02aa	Wow,<br>  <br>  Just the not smoking can cause a lot of anxiety that can trigger a panic attack especially if you are prone to them. Have you tried talk therapy to help you, There are some really nice behavioral approaches to help you deal with your anxiety.<br>  <br>  The exercise will be perfect. Try to make yourself exhausted, so you will have little to no energy. Thats not to mean that you won't have any anxiety... it will help.<br>  <br>  I certainly believe that you are the expert on whether or not Celexa is working for you or not. You should make an appointment with your prescriber and they can assist you in trying a different dosage or another med altogether. Don't give up.  Your anxiety did not occur overnight, and you will not find a magic medication that takes it away. Be patient with yourself and your MD. I happen to know that alot of Mds will try Wellbutrin for the smoking censation.<br>  <br>  Smoking is a emotional as well as physical dependence, so throwing your smokes out is a good step. As i said before, Talk therapy is good, or find a good board online to find some help during the hard times.<br>  <br>  I am going to skip the herbal part of the question because I cannot answer that one.<br>  <br>  Look at it as giving your "future" self a gift of wellness. <br>  <br>  Hey, we all fail....

AA11992611	You might have clinical depression, especially if there is no "specific" reason you feel down. I'm sometimes like how you describe, ok some days, the other days feel horrible. I would suggest that you talk to your doctor, explain to him/her what is going on. They can help you either figure out what is wrong with you, or point you to someone that can help. I would suggest that you google "depression symptoms" and if you are a teen or kid, you need to add that into the search (some symptoms differ between age groups). Please don't hurt yourself, I've been a self injurer for 3 years, and it isn't something you want to get into. Even if you tell yourself it is just this once, you could easily become addicted to the psychological and chemical pros of self injury. So please, resist the urge, it's great that you have thus far. If you are considering hurting yourself in any way, I would suggest professional help. I'm currently seeing a counselor and I would definetly suggest something like that, if you can. Just give it a thought. But please, tell someone, like a doctor or parent, about how you are feeling. They are there to help you, and it definetly sounds like you could use any help you can get. If you need to talk you can email me at apprehensivehope101@yahoo.com. I hope things get better for  you. Best of luck|`|AA11232354	Dear Vlaxhm,<br>  You are not alone and you are not hopeless.  I had something like you describe when I was younger.  It happens when we don't seem to fit in or be able to make anyone else happy and we seem to be just in the way.<br>  <br>  When I realize that God loves me so much that he sent his Son to die on the cross for me, then I can bask in that love and do His will by giving his love to others.  Then I realize that Jesus is up in heaven right now as the Bible tells us and that he is making a beautiful home for us and when it is ready and the time is right, he will take us to that home just beacaue He loves us so much and wants to be with us forever.  The Bible tells us these things and we can depend on it.  God wants our love.<br>  <br>  Now God wants us to give his love to others.  So you can start my smiling at everyone you meet.  Don't stay at home but go out to the mall and smile at everyone and say hello.  Every morning when you get up send a note or a happy email or a phone call or one of each to a friend or relative that you have not talked to for a few days, showing your interest in their welfare and happiness.  Take flowers to the office or your community service job.  Or to your neighbor if you are a housewife.  These things matter.<br>  <br>  Try to play happy music, plan wholesome meals, make yourself as attractive as possible, walk or ride a bike everyday.  If you do not have a community service job, you might want to see if you can take a dog for a walk every day from the humane society.  It is worthwhile to give to charity even if it is only a quarter that you put into a jar at the grocery store for whatever they are collecting for.  Try to never let such an opportunity go by.  It is worth it.  Think of other little things you can do for your family and friends and also for yourself.  The little things count and you are a worthwhile person as long as you are doing such things every day.  There are always days when no one seems to care if we are around, days when everyone around us wish we weren't there, but somewhere, someone wants to see your smile and talk to you.  You can help someone almost every day on Yahoo Q and A.   Also, I just said a prayer for you.|`|b7573437be6b5bcf439589edbb4ce3faaa	See the sections on self harm & depression treatments/resources at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> on pages 4 & 2.|`|271VqIeWaa	it's deffinataly a drastic case of RETARDATION.|`|AluYam4daa	Seek professional help before you take things too far. You might be suffering from depression from all sorts of outside factors such as stress. There are hotlines that are available to you that may help. go and call them right now! sorry i dont have the numbers but google it.|`|tbIIbmGvaa	I felt the same way some days and completely normal other days. When it first happened to me, I went into a state of shock, but after some time passed I realized that I wasn't the only one experiencing these weird feelings and thoughts. What helped me the most is getting it out of my chest. Talking to other people and finding out that other people go thru phases like this in their lives, helps understand that you're not alone. I'm no expert, but I have read a lot and I know that there are millions of people that put up with these symptoms. You can seek professional help or you can try to overcome it by yourself. One thing I would not suggest you, is taking medication, cause then you get addicted and that's another bigger problem to deal with. In the days when you feel the worst, remember that this is only temporary and that you will feel good again. Getting out and socializing, even if you hate it, helps a lot. It's very important that you don't close yourself in your room and not talk to anyone. It's unbelievable how much getting things out of your chest helps. Someone told me this one time and I will tell this to you: "When you reach the end of the rope, tie a knot and hang on." Hope it's not serious and you get to feeling better soon. I did it, and you can too. Love, McDi.

What i think helps is, if you keep a diary and everyday write what you eat. What i think is that at the end of the day, i want to see healthy choices so before you think about snacking on fatty foods think about what you want to see yourself as and if this is going to help.   Sure give your self a treat as you do need varitey. Drink plenty of fluids as usually people confuse hunger with thirst & just keep yourself busy.

However , I think the food industry, ads, and other contributing factors are, in my opinion, criminal in their helping all this problems come about.

v7hkYRDLaa	I have UC, it is an inflammatory bowel disorder.     Your body attacks all the bacteria in your intestines and kills it, this in turn makes your intestines bleed. Than you bleed everytime you have a bowel movement. Sometimes there is mucus in the bowel movement.  This is all very disturbing the first 100 times it happens. And if you have UC you might have run to the bathroom 5-10 times a day for a week, or two or for months. You may lose tons of weight and need to be hospitalized.  You may become depressed. You may stop eating or drinking certain foods, and start eating other foods, this helps some and does nothing for others.     What to do: Go to a doctor, get diagnosed, than get medicine.  Colazol really helped me. The steroid predizone also helps very quickly, but side effects are bad.     Sometimes medicine doesn't work and that  means a year or two of suffering and than removal of part of your intestines or all of your intestines and a colostomy bag, not an easy way to live, but so many people have one. I feel fortunate medicine has worked for me.     There is a lot of great info on line. Note: Get screened for colon cancer as well, UC can lead to colon cancer.    I work at one of the many Camp Oasis programs for kids with Crohns and UC. So many people live with UC, you can too. The first six months were hellish, but now that I'm in remission, I only get very sick once or twice a year, it's still a little upsetting, but I foverall I feel great and I have a much greater appreciation of my health.

The main symptom of active disease is usually constant diarrhea mixed with blood, of gradual onset. Ulcerative colitis is, however, a systemic disease that affects many parts of the body outside the intestine.  Patients usually present with diarrhea mixed with blood and mucus, of gradual onset. They also may have signs of weight loss, and blood on rectal examination. The disease is usually accompanied with different degrees of abdominal pain, from mild discomfort to severely painful cramps.  If you suspect that you have this disease you should go to a doctor as soon as possible. there are treatments and you can get help.|`|t9IrZHqJaa	To keep it short, Ulcerative Colitis is an auto-immune disese of the digestive tract (colon and/or rectum are most common sites). Usually patients with Ulcerative colitis present with bloody, mucous filled diarrhea that occurs many times a day.     Unfortunately, about 30% of the patients i see with uc eventually require sugery, but surgury usually brings an end to symptoms. Also, patients with untreated uc are at a much greater risk for colorectal cancer. UC is usually treated with a variety of anti-inflammatory drugs (corticosteroids and even NSAIDS like ibuprofen). If you think you have this condition you should check up with your doctor.|`|pALAoZSKaa	Ulcerative colitis (Colitis ulcerosa, UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).[1] Ulcerative colitis is a form of colitis, a disease of the intestine, specifically the large intestine or colon, that includes characteristic ulcers, or open sores, in the colon. The main symptom of active disease is usually constant diarrhea mixed with blood, of gradual onset. Ulcerative colitis is, however, a systemic disease that affects many parts of the body outside the intestine. Because of the name, IBD is often confused with irritable bowel syndrome ("IBS"), a troublesome, but much less serious condition. Ulcerative colitis has similarities to Crohn's disease, another form of IBD. Ulcerative colitis is an intermittent disease, with periods of exacerbated symptoms, and periods that are relatively symptom-free. Although the symptoms of ulcerative colitis can sometimes diminish on their own, the disease usually requires treatment to go into remission.    Ulcerative colitis occurs in 35-100 people for every 100,000 in the United States,[2] or less than 0.1% of the population. The disease tends to be more common in northern areas. Although ulcerative colitis has no known cause, there is a presumed genetic component to susceptibility. The disease may be triggered in a susceptible person by environmental factors. Although dietary modification may reduce the discomfort of a person with the disease, ulcerative colitis is not thought to be caused by dietary factors. Although ulcerative colitis is treated as though it were an autoimmune disease, there is no consensus that it is such. Treatment is with anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppression, and biological therapy targeting specific components of the immune response. Colectomy (partial or total removal of the large bowel through surgery) is occasionally necessary, and is considered to be a cure for the disease.|`|Hacoibteaa	what about ulcerative coitus?

PGkR813Jaa	You should never muck around with a prescribed medication especially Adderall.    After a month, sometimes longer, the body is going to get used to the drug in your system.  This is when the Doctor prescribing it needs to be told and then they can decide if the dosage needs to be adjusted.    DO NOT JUST STOP IT!!! It will cause withdrawal symptoms.    Keep taking it at the prescribed amount and make an appointment with your Psychiatrist to have yourself reviewed.
tdN2ouxAaa	Although you're technically selling your eggs, the term "Human Egg Donation" is the one commonly used because it sounds more PC than stating that you are actually SELLING the eggs.    Women can sell their eggs in upwards of $30k/egg, but according to this article, you might only get about $5k to $10k per egg:    http://www.jillstanek.com/archives/2008/...    Keep in mind that many women who sell their eggs must pass a mental and physical health screening. Sometimes, an I.Q. test might be required (which is reasonable, as these people are paying BIG BUCKS for these eggs).     Google "Human Eggs"  and/or "Human Egg Donation" and see what pops up!|`|8U40dDtEaa	1st of all only freaks buy eggs and 2nd of all why would u do that the baby will have your genes!! you will still be the mother!!!!|`|iTyLs2S6aa	Key Word DONATION.  get it now.

We6rY8ynaa	Yes it is very normal to break out around ovulation- even more common than breakouts around your period. It is just due to a change in your hormone levels. You have more problems with hormones when ovulating then you will any other time in your cycle. About them being painful it is because your pain threshold is a lot lower during ovulation(Due to those crazy hormones again). Hope this helps.|`|YAwvszITaa	yes it is hormonal|`|9TyrKyK6aa	yeah it's normal for you to breakout during this time and for them to be painful. it has something to do with hormones.
2q1XI0j9aa	if you will use the gym its definitely worth it!!    To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , eggs, low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.), shape and woman's health videos. Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!|`|5q5ftpfmaa	you don't need to join a gym. Just go to a local high school track or something. you could run (stretch when you run, i know it's annoying). I run 2-3 miles when i run. also, do push ups and sit ups every day. do pull ups every other day.  If you do all of these things, you should see a huge difference in as little as 2 weeks.

At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.

Gxog88I3aa	I agree that this might be part of his problems, but if he is physically abusive to people as an adult he does need to be seen by a professional.      Depending on how he was raised and his childhood influences he might very well feel that this is very normal behavior.

You have these all throughout your neck and under your ears and other areas too.  These sometimes get inflamed when you are sick or if there is some foreign material that your body is fighting off.  They kind of feel like a hard bump and might be kind of tender.  These usually go away on their own in a few days or weeks.  You can put a warm towel on it if it feels tender.

DzHB8z6Yaa	Act fast. The constant adjustments involved when you have braces cause inevitable pain. However, if you treat the pain early, you are much more likely to make the experience more tolerable.     Step 2: Take pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relief drugs such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help treat the deep mouth pain associated with new braces and constant adjustment. This pain originates from the pressure of shifting teeth and extends into the gums and jaws.     Step 3: Use wax. Orthodontists generally offer an unlimited supply of wax to patients. The friction associated with wires and metal fittings in the mouth tend to cause sores and cut the insides of cheeks and lips. By placing a ball of wax over the metal of the braces, especially at night, patients can avoid further irritation.     Step 4: Invest in an oral anesthetic. Over-the-counter anesthetics like Anbesol and Orajel temporarily deaden the mouth. Dab a small amount of the anesthetic on a cotton swab and apply it to sores in the mouth. The gel will deaden the spot and completely take away the pain for a limited amount of time. This method is particularly effective when trying to fall asleep at night. The gel wears off by morning, but allows a pathway to sleep.     Step 5:Try toothpaste for sensitive teeth. If you have a naturally sensitive mouth, a toothpaste for sensitive teeth can lessen mouth sensitivity over time and treat pain on a long term basis. By lessening the sensitivity of the mouth the adjustment of braces hurts less.     Step 6: Give it time. A tolerance to the pain associated with braces takes time. The longer you have braces the less you will experience the sores, cuts and deep pain that are common in the early stages|`|MGvN5xrNaa	I know how you feel:(    I went through the same thing too.

The thing you have to remember it to kind of stick through the pain because it's going to be around for awhile.    remember it will be worth it to have straight pearly whites :D|`|61DjhHGeaa	i had braces for 3 years, they suck. your mouth will most likely hurt for a couple of days after each visit to the orthodontist (assuming he will put a new wire on every time.) my mouth/ teeth only hurt for a couple of days after, and it got better throughout the 3 years. the first few months are the worst. i ate things like mashed potatoes, soups, bananas, pretty much anything you can squish around in your mouth and dont have to chew. it will get better trust me! hope you feel better|`|fij4cX5haa	Only Nachos.

I don't think you know enough about the tests they do on the liver.  Also, what kind of hepatitis are you talking about?  There are several.  How did your ALT on your liver come out?  I think that's the one to look at if you think you have hepatitis.|`|W4whHKmxaa	According to what I have read...these are  the symptoms of Gilbert's disease.  Asymptomatic;  jaundice, fatigue, nausea,  abdominal pain in right upper quadrant.    If you are unsure of the diagnosis the doctor  gave you, you should get a second opinion.    Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver cells.  When damage is done to the cells, this  causes the immune system to respond and  then inflammation develops.  This   inflammation causes the liver to enlarge.  This can be seen on an ultrasound.  It can  confirm if there is Hepatitis present.     Be sure your doctor knows all medication you  are taking...this includes over the counter,  herbs, herbal teas, vitamins, minerals,  and drugs prescribed by other doctors.  Most all medications go through the liver  first to be broken down before going to the  rest of the body.

278113a07b7b6648ec6e32639de20bf9aa	I'm not getting the HPV (Gardisil) vaccine. I have 3 sons, but if I had a daughter, she wouldn't get it, either. I'm not saying that it is "bad," however, they DO NOT know the long term effects of it. Nor is it necessarily all they claim it to be. It only protects from SOME strands of HPV - there are several others - so you could get infected with another one of the strands.     A lot of women getting vaccinated falsely believe they are "covered" from getting the cervical cancer. It's not like that. They make all these cute ads of cute women getting this done because it's "best" and they don't want to "worry" about cervical cancer. The best thing is taking proper care of yourself through diet and exercise, and not having so many sex partners.     If you see the links I've provided below, there are plenty of reasons to question getting this vaccine. However, these types of things WILL NOT be on the TV or the newspapers. I think they could get in "trouble" or something or lose funding if they said anything negative about it - even if it's true.     You are very wise to look into this first, than just to blindly get something because of a cute ad.    As for the appointment, they will put this thing inside your vagina and it will stretch it out so they can get a sample.  They use a q-tip type thing and swab around to get the sample.  It shouldn't hurt, but I've had a couple doctors that were a little "rougher."  If it's uncomfortable, communicate it with the doctor so he/she'll know to ease up.      Also, please note that if the doctor is a man, there should be a female nurse in there while he's doing the exam.  If not, DEMAND one, because it's very unprofessional otherwise.  I've never been put in that position, but you never know.      They will most likely check your breasts at this time as well - for lumps or whatever.  It's a normal part of the whole exam.  Just be aware of this, so you'll know what to expect and won't be shocked.|`|34AceKm2aa	i got my gardisil shots at my well visit and i'm 13... you just go because it prevents cervical cancer.... just go to a regular doctor (the one you'd go to for a sore throat) and talk to them about Gardisil shots than have your mom come in and have the doctor explain it... it is good    you get them over like 6 months...( i think!?)    they space them over time so its fine... i've never been to a gynocologist!
dibW2uNzaa	Yep- it sounds like a Urinary Tract Infection- they often come on close to, or while you are on your period.  Drink lots of water, cranberry juice and check your grocery store or pharmacy for "Uricalm."  Uricalm is almost identical to what your Doc. will give you for a UTI.  It takes away the pain, a lot of the urges, and it turns your pee bright orange.|`|HR6wT7ojaa	it could be some kind of bladder infection or something. That happened to me but it just kind of went away after a day.|`|iTyLs2S6aa	If it keeps going on, you need to go to a doctor.|`|AA11844665	It sounds like a urinary tract infection! If that is what is going on then oj is probably the worst for it because of the acid, drink LOTS OF WATER AND CRANBERRY juice. if it don't clear up in 2-3 days see a dr sometimes they need an antibiotic in order to clear up. Hope you feel better soon|`|TIqFAXo1aa	Possibly a bladder infection- drink a ton of water & cranberry juice- if it keeps up see a Dr.|`|45ab0bea68cbc724ceec9b426a6147b3aa	You may have a UTI urinary Tract Infection. is there pain or a burning sensation. If so please see your doctor it can get worse. Very painful in the latter stages.|`|cioK92Lpaa	if it is a bladder infection, drinking cranberry juice will help.  you really should ask your doctor.  the only way to tell if it is a bladder/urinary tract infection is by submitting a urine specimen.
qg9l2gcPaa	When your young your periods are irregular, don't worry about it too much.  Unless you've had sex or on birth control or something..|`|AEAS7A9naa	Yes,   I missed my period once and was fine. it's probably because you're doing something different through excercise, diet, or something stress related has happened.  Robin|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	yes its normal, your still developing, if you miss 3 in a row though speak to your GP just to make sure nothing is wrong. hope i helped :)|`|dibW2uNzaa	Additional Info?

Some people say its a huge deal and you need to get it checked out but I didn't and it turned out just fine. Its possible that you might just get a longer period this month or possibly 2 short ones.    Really, I would only worry about it if your feeling diffrent or if you've participated in sexual activity.|`|bunAXlrXaa	did u start a sport recently or something  everyone is irregular...  how many days has it been since u were due?  u can e-mail me|`|iTyLs2S6aa	It depends on your age?

Or, are you underweight or have become athletic? It's probably fine but if it persists, you may want to see your doc!|`|EWR01atlaa	well of course i wouldn't like saying. You miss your period when your pregnant or just by how your body is doing. I miss my period a lot. So i'd say at young ages it's ok to miss your period a couple times.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Yes.

JTU1w3Maaa	Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication in patients with diabetes mellitus. Near complete deficiency of insulin and elevated levels of certain stress hormones increase the chance of a DKA episode. DKA is more common among Type I diabetics, but may also occur in Type II diabetics, particularly during periods of increased physiologic stress, such as during an infection. Patients with new, undiagnosed Type I diabetes frequently present to hospitals with DKA. DKA can also occur in a known diabetic who fails to take prescribed insulin, or in diabetics who fall sick due to illnesses such as pneumonia or a kidney infection. DKA was a major cause of death in Type I diabetics before insulin injections were available; untreated DKA has a high mortality rate.              symptons:    Sluggishness, extreme tiredness.   Extreme thirst, despite large fluid intake.   Constant urination   Fruity smell to breath, similar to nail polish remover (acetone).   Hyperventilation, at first rapid and shallow, then progressively deeper and less rapid.   Extreme weight loss.   Oral Thrush and/or persistent vaginal yeast infections may be present; this is because the normal fungal flora present in the oral cavity and cervix is disrupted   Muscle wasting.   Agitation / Irritation / Aggression / Confusion   Vomiting, nausea   Extreme pain in shoulders, neck and chest|`|o8Xfn2bfaa	Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication in patients with diabetes mellitus.

DKA was a major cause of death in Type I diabetics before insulin injections were available; untreated DKA has a high mortality rate.|`|Lckon4W0aa	DKA is diabetic ketoacidosis. This is what happens when someone's blood sugar becomes too high for the body to function. When a diabetic goes into DKA, their body is overwhelmed by the amount of unused glucose in the blood. In normal situations, the pancreas will produce the correct amount of insulin to convert the sugar into energy, but in diabetics, they either produce no insulin (Type 1) or the body produces very little or can't use what it does produce (Type 2).  When the body isn't getting the energy it needs to survive, it starts burning the fats in the body and proteins in the muscles (called Ketones). When this builds up, the kidneys try to flush out all of the excess sugar and ketones, causing excessive urination and extreme thirst from dehydration, as well as weight loss from the burning fats and proteins. The blood becomes too acidic for the body, basically poisoning it from the inside out. If it goes untreated, it can cause someone to go into a coma and even die.    Some symptoms include:  Excessive urination  Extreme thirst  "Fruity" smelling breath or urine  Extreme hunger  Weight loss  Extremely high blood sugar  sometimes headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, and general sluggishness can be signs    Hope this helps!|`|WadzK6ejaa	It is Diabetic KetoAcidosis it when blood sugar is high and blood Ph is low.hyperventilating .ketone bodies are positive .this is medical emergency
AEAS7A9naa	I wouldn't worry about it. I've missed a period before. If you miss your 3rd though then talk to your doctor. It also depends. How many times have you had your period before. If only once or twice it can up to a year untill you have it again and even then you're still irregular for 1-2 years.  Robin|`|yQn34zO7aa	sometimes in the first year of your period your body is still adjusting to the cycle and your period isn't regular yet. after a year it will continue to be every month|`|MBg7wLe2aa	i don't think so. i am 14 and i eat really really bad. like guaranteed worse than you. i'm not fat i just have a really fast metabolism. usually when your young and the first couple years of your period you sometimes skip. i have a friend that was totally fine and she skipped three|`|bunAXlrXaa	it's totally normal   everyone is irregular|`|2opWeKQBaa	I know someone who has a period every 3 months and that's regular for her... *shrug* if you haven't had one in more than 4 months...i would be worried|`|I83sYbARaa	You sound 'ordinary'.... hormones can effect how much you eat..... If you know of a trustworthy nurse, or parent, or adult to talk to, you could ask them your questions.    If you ever see a doctor, have your thyroid checked, too.... and when you go to eat something look at the ingrediants on the back section and see if it has high fructose corn syrup in it...  that substance and others are KNOWN to shut down the message of 'I'm full' the stomach is suppose to send to the brain, to shut off the appetite...    The food industry does this on purpose to keep us fat as pigs, and buying their products.... the food industry is under a lot of complaints from americans and consumers.... and YOU AND EVERYONE should really check each label of your food and drinks, and be astounded by the ingrediants... then share the info with your parents, and see if you all could shop for food at whole food places that dont allow the additives......  Then dont forget to walk at least 30 minutes each day.... and find activities that move your body in exercise that are fun to you, and join a group or something.  If you want to complain about food additives, go to www.change.gov and send president Obama your thoughts.....

9D9hMNvLaa	Actually, yes! But don't get excited, it's like any other piece of paper. It can be eaten...but it shouldn't be.   When the Stride Company was asked if the gum wrappers were edible they replied, "While Stride(r) gum is designed to be chewed for a ridiculously long time, our gum wrappers are not. All of our gum wrappers are made with materials that comply with FDA regulations for food contact materials; however, none of our chewing gum wrappers are designed to be ingested. While theres nothing toxic in them, gum wrappers arent intended for ingestion and gum wrappers should not be eaten. Should you have any questions or concerns about your children ingesting gum wrappers, please contact your doctor or other health care professional."

YEd9Q5KZaa	Holy **** don't eat that stuff man. That is so bad like I can't even believe that is what you eat in a day. If you have no motivation, take it slow. You could stop eating chocolate bars for example, try to go as long as you can without one and if you do have to give in, don't have the whole thing. You'll get used to not having them and then you will crave them less and less. You have to find something that you can replace with all of those unhealthy things. Who ever is buying that for you needs to stop. Make a routine of when you're going to eat your meals, you seem like you need some structure. If you eat lunch at school at 11am, consider that your breakfast, try and eat every four hours or so. Also, don't laugh along with those stupid "jokes".|`|HYVmgV7Vaa	Stop "being" fat.

At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!

After having irregular periods for three years, I started taking them and have had periods every month.  They are much lighter than they used to be, and they're aren't painful at all!  I just got off of my period. It was pretty light, and all I needed were pantyliners. I didn't even use pads!  In addition to helping your period, the Pill can help clear acne (this is why a lot of people with bad acne go on it), and, like the name suggests, it protects against pregnancy. If you're sexually active, that is.  Talk about a triple play, right? :)  Best of luck!

I'd recommend you use a low-dose pill, such as Alesse, and perhaps take three cycles in a row without interruption.

Good luck!|`|oMGasIcjaa	Birth control pills really help reduce the heaviness of your flow.  I have used them in the past.  If on the pill, your flow lasts approx. 5 days from start to finish.  The good thing is, you know exactly what day you will be getting your period so you can be prepared.  It is like clock work! At least it was for me. :)|`|REK3uyAuaa	Your best bet would be birth control it reduces the cramping and the flow. Make sure you ask your doctor witch type would be best for you.

Had them too. I wouldn't advise to go on the pill, just yet. Talk t your Dr. first, and he will advise you. Try to put your feet up when you can, when having a rest, but don't try to stop the flow, as the is a natural part of your body makeup. For the cramps, get midol ore something similar. I wouldn't advise Tampons for the first 3 days, as this will cause clotting. And this can be more painful. Please see your family Dr. Maybe they will have some more up dated advice.|`|509b8d2dc8b9cad54992d795f806518eaa	The pill would be an effective way to reduce your flow but if you're not keen on the idea of using contraception yet for whatever reason you can also be prescibed mefenamic acid (or similar drugs)  Basically if you go see your doctor they will be able to help you choose whats best for you!
T4XPtQOeaa	You need to go to a doctor to get this double-checked.    For now, take some extra precautions to keep yourself from getting sick. Go to bed earlier. Sleep in longer if you can.  Make sure you drink lots and eat very nutrient-filled diets.  Try to make yourself optimize your diet and your resting habits.  HAVE A STABLE SHEDULE FOR BOTH.    Your body does NOT understand some patterns that your brain does.  So make sure you try to have the SAME sleeping shedule for the weekend as the weekdays, and if you get more sleep then, then that is good too.  Also, the same with food.  Try to keep things rather sheduled.    It'll take a little while for your body to get into the swing of things with the shedule, and it should help to keep yourself nice and healthy, to keep things in balance.  Also, it can  help to distinguish the serious problems from things like the common cold.    A healthy shedule shall also bump up your immune system    I hope this can help!

I'm not usually one for medication but I have to say you seem to be struggling enough to benefit from something to get you on the right track to recovery.

I would def go see someone before you end up hurting yourself even more.  Hope this helps.  Get better>|`|XSTjyO1naa	Recognizing depression or anxiety for what it is no easy matter either. You need to go to the Dr or Counselor. There are various depression symptoms to be on the look-out for as parents of teens, teachers, helpers, friends and influencers in the teenagers life, particularly if these depression-like symptoms are uncharacteristic of the teen, disruptive to daily life and normal functioning, leads to negative behaviour that impacts or endangers the interpersonal social and family relationships, consistent low self esteem vented as either aggression and/or withdrawal and feelings of worthlessness and futility,  that lasts more than two weeks and do not seem to dissipate: irrational on-going uneasiness and anxiety, interference with the ability to think clearly, notice and remember details, inability to make any/good decisions, poor performance in school, withdrawal from friends and activities,  inexplicable feelings of despair, guilt, apathy, sadness and hopelessness, lack of enthusiasm, energy or motivation, anger and rage, overreaction to criticism, feelings of being unable to satisfy ideals , poor self-esteem or guilt,  forgetfulness, restlessness and agitation, noticeable and significant changes in eating or sleeping patterns, fatigue,  insomnia, appetite disturbances, substance abuse, problems with authority, suicidal thoughts or actions. Some of these, all or a couple of these symptoms might be present which merits discussing it openly, keeping the channels of communication open, seeking professional help and counsel.|`|unrQGM9laa	have you talked to a psychiatrist or counselor maybe you need medication|`|DCwGQDO9aa	Anxiety feels like your about to lose your mind.  You feel as if you can't breathe, your heart is beating fast, and your palms feel sweaty.  It's the flight or fight feeling that you get along with these symptoms.  Most of the time things like this happen after a tragic event, or to much stress in a short period of time has occured.  It can be confusing because your body may react to stress, and other things going on in your mind when it's quiet, the time when nothing should be happening.  This is because your body is trying to deal with the stress and you only realize it when things are quiet, not much going on.  Try to exercise, and make sure to remind yourself that your not dying, it's just aniexty.    This should help|`|AH3ZEBbYaa	I'm going to just assume you're a teenager because you sound like someone who would be around my age.    My friend, it sounds a lot like you have depression.  Believe me, it's not fun, but it is possible to get out of it.    One of the major indicators of depression, especially in teens, is irritability. Even if you don't notice it (which you have), it's usually there.  Depression makes you a completely different person pretty quickly. So if people around you (including yourself) seem to think that you've changed rather quickly or all of a sudden you're acting outside of how you normally are, you're probably depressed.    Missing school is also a pretty big symptom of depression. Believe me, been there, done that. I almost missed an entire quarter of school, haha. This is a really big indicator that something is wrong. And your lack of interest in things you used to enjoy is a major symptom of depression.    Other depression symptoms include change in appetite, suicidal ideation, change in sleep patterns, headaches, feelings of guilt, delusions, etc. If you have any of these, then chances are you have depression.  Even without these, with the symptoms you've described, I'm almost certain you have it.    Moving right along, it seems to me like you also have a panic disorder (I know how that is too, haha). A panic disorder is basically anxiety with panic attacks. This could be one of the reasons why you're missing more school, at least it was for me. A lot of your boyfriend fears sound a lot like anxiety. It makes you think the world is coming to an end, and it makes you feel even worse; jittery, paranoid, scared, etc.    I would highly reccommend seeing a medical professional. It's completely normal and will help you get better in the long term. Depression and anxiety are extremely common diseases and there's no way to prevent them. So don't feel guilty or crazy or anything, because there are a LOT of people out there who feel similar to you. Please see someone before things start getting worse, as depression IS a life-threatening illness. That being said, it will (thankfully) only last for a short time in retrospect to the rest of your life (most episodes last 4-6 months).    If you can't talk to your parents about it, talk to your pediatrition or school counselor. They're used to hearing this kind of stuff and can refer you somewhere where you can get help.    If you need to talk or need anymore help, please feel free to get in contact with me =)
9D9hMNvLaa	My sisters got their braces off around this time last year. Instead of getting the traditional metal retainers they had the option of invisalign. I'm not sure how much they cost to get on, but the orthodontist said that they cost about $90 apiece to replace if they're lost or broken. (This means 90$ for the top piece and $90 for the bottom) So I'd say that they cost under $100, maybe...?|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	What about getting the gap filled in with some bonding. Tooth colored composite the dentist shapes to look like your real tooth. Costs about $120 and takes about an hour....|`|pT2gciq2aa	the that girl above me. I don't think that correct because you need a new tray for every movement.
yJSPecgoaa	Have you tried the natural salt deodorants?  Made of mineral salts, they are hypoallergenic.  They do not contain any harsh chemicals, aluminum, perfumes, oils, emulsifiers, alcohol, or propellants, which is why they are ideal for those who are otherwise allergic to deodorants.      What salt deodorants do is discourage bacteria from forming.  (Salt is a natural bacteria deterrent.)  It is the bacteria on the skin, not the perspiration itself, that causes odor.    There are several brands of salt deodorants, but one is Crystal.  You can probably find it (or a similar product) at your local drug store.  A picture of itcan be seen here:    http://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Body-Deodo...    To keep the amount of bacteria (and therefore odor) to an absolute minimum, you will also want to be sure to bathe with soap and water at least once a day, giving special attention to areas where you perspire.|`|uxvskU7Xaa	if ur allergic to deoderant its probably the aluminum in it or the perfume in it ..... i am the same way  i use either arm and hammer brand free and clear no perfumes   my favorite thing is a deoderant stick i get at a vitamin or health food store i get mine at HEB grocery (texas only) or THE VITAMIN SHOPPE but i know they hav GNC also and most healthy food stores  mine i have now ids called ALL NATURAL PROTECTION CRYSTAL BODY DEODERANT STICK its hypoallergenic fragrance and paraben free - no aluminum chlorohydrate   it is made of mineral salts eliminates odors by craeting a barrier against the odor causing bateria -- its clear goes on clear and leavesabsolutely no residue -- u just put it on after u shower and no odor all day - it doesn't work to good if u already have an odor but if u put it on just after showering it  works great -- i have no odor till my next shower time -- it last a long time too --- it will cost about $5-7 but i have had mine for almost a yr i use it daily and i still havent used it all there still about 1/4 of it so its actually cheaper than regular stuff|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	It seems highly unlikely that you'd be allergic to every single deodorant there is. Work with your doctor to determine what ingredient you need to avoid.    OTC antiperspirants work by temporarily plugging pores with an aluminum chloride solution of 10% or less. You can buy two 12% brands, Xerac and Certain-Dri, but they're not in every drugstore. Products up to 20% strength are manufactured but require a prescription.    Many equally effective products introduced late in 2007 are available without prescription. They rely on aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex GLY, which is not only more effective than prescription-only aluminum chloride but substantially less irritating.    Brands include Degree, Secret, Gillette, Old Spice, Right Guard, Sure, and Dove. Look for Clinical Strength on the package front or for the active ingredient. All protect against wetness, and all contain odor-fighting ingredients and skin conditioners to counter irritation. Some are scented.    All are meant to be applied at night, before going to bed, for the best effectiveness the next day, including after showering the next day.    Failing that, the liquid version of Mitchum Unscented is certainly worth trying, even though it takes a long time to dry. You also want to wash your underarms with an antibacterial soap at least once a daily, preferably twice.
ufgv7oTjaa	It's possible that it might cause aggression because it is a product that is commonly used for sexual health and can help support Testosterone. It's not as beneficial directly for Testosterone as some other sexual health products, but it does have some impact regardless. If you don't like the aggressive tendencies, I would suggest trying something else like Horny Goat Weed that doesn't impact Testosterone as much. Good luck and I hope I helped!

However, I can't say for sure that it was the creatine that did it or my commitment to working out regularly.

wzM5WB8Xaa	Generally, someone's cycle is 28 days, but it can vary from person to person and even within one person. When you first get your period, you may find yourself skipping periods, having really light periods, and your cycle may be 21 days one month and over 30 days the next. Weight loss and gain and stress can also effect your cycle. If you are worried about being pregnant, talk to someone about birth control. If you are just curious and aren't sexually active, then don't worry if things are a little weird right now. They will get better as your body matures.|`|YAwvszITaa	Welcome to womanhood.

We become infected through open wounds-- even a scratch is a break in the skin and is a potentially open door.  Good hygiene is a defense, as is a healthy immune system. Frequent hand-washing, keeping ones hands away from the nose, mouth, eyes, and wounds will reduce contamination. Using an alcohol-based hand gel when soap and water aren't available is an alternative.  If you get a scratch, use antibiotic ointment/cream and cover with a bandage until a scab forms.  If you do get sick, be sure to take ALL doses of the prescribed antibiotics. By not taking the full course, any bug will gain in strength and render antibiotics useless. Not good!
R4DvjCfyaa	A lot of variables depend on how quickly you are able to loose your belly fat. Without being lengthy in my explanation and instructions, I would simply recommend that you find a qualified personal trainer that you could secure for AT LEAST a few weeks in order to design a program specific to your needs, as well as to show you proper form. An added bonus to hiring a Personal Trainer is the on-going encouragement that one would provide.  You may also want to look into a group circuit-training class which combines cardio and strength-training all in one work-out. One of the many benefits of this type of work-out is that your heart-rate remains elevated throughout the 40 - 60 minutes that you're training, which is excellent for fat burn. In addition, your metabolism will continue to operate at a higher rate even after your work-out due to the muscle toning. Most usually, the abdominal muscles are very well targeted in this type of class.  I wish you the best of luck in your quest to trim down and get fit :)

Try to only eat chicken breast, and steak but only 8 oz of steak too much is bad. And drink a lot of water. Eat veggies like spinach, brussels sprouts, broccoli.<br>  And fruit like, apples, oranges. and you need protein to loose weight, like egg whites<br>  <br>  Eat foods like that and you will loose weight.<br>  <br>  for the carbs, eat only brown carbs not white, like wheat breat whole wheat oatmeal.<br>  <br>  Eat foods like that|`|2096dbc436197a7ffe001823a61c1841aa	Yes, but if you do not any meat or protien you will loose your hair|`|QTUPvRq0aa	Hi Mizzdeama! Good for you for looking to expand your health knowledge.<br>  <br>  Will you lose weight? Almost certainly. A diet of strictly water and green vegetables is extremely low in calories. It's understandable to want to lose weight rapidly, most of us do, but you'll receive the best results with a healthier diet. I would not recommend losing weight by a diet consisting of just water and greens.<br>  <br>  You will lose "weight". With this type of diet, a low percentage of that weight will be fat. Meaning you will be losing a lot of lean muscle tissue. This is not desireable because lean muscle tissue helps burn fat as well as provides a hard toned look when fat is burned off. Plus, lean muscle tissue is HARD to gain. <br>  <br>  You would most likely lose weight with this diet, but it would be the wrong type of weight. Plus, you'd be starving yourself of needed nutrients by eliminating protein and carbohydrate sources. <br>  <br>  If you try this diet, don't be surprised if you lose weight initially but end up worse off down the road.<br>  <br>  Some quick tips:<br>  <br>  Do your cardio first thing upon waking on an empty stomach.<br>  Eat small meals about every 3 hours. Portion sizes should be such that you are ready to eat again about every 3 hours. This will keep certain hormones balanced throughout the day to aid in fat loss and fat prevention.<br>  Meals should be balanced. Meaning: if your meal/snack calorie breakdown is about 40% carbs, 30% protein, and 30% fat, then the rest of your meals should consist of the same breakdown. An EXCEPTION is any meal/snack within a few hours of bedtime. This meal/snack should be strictly protein, no carbs and no fats.<br>  Minimize your sugar and saturated fat intake.<br>  Include Resistance Training 3 times a week. The benefits of resistance training are extremely numerous! Fat loss is included.<br>  <br>  To ensure the most efficient and the safest results, utilize a Personal Trainer (or Online Personal Trainer) well educated in Exercise Physiology and Nutrition. If you have any questions, my website (address is below) may be able to answer them, or feel free to email me anytime: info@acclaimedfitness.com.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Justin Brink<br>  B.S.

Crema y un bol que utilizaras en primera instancia para mezclar agua con detergente en el cual meteras tus unas unos 10 segundos y luego empezaras secandolas y sacando todo el resto que se mete debajo de ellas, Luego las cortas las limas y con el sacacuticula empiezas a cortar esa carnesita que te quita vista buena a la u?a.

zMD0VeOmaa	I'm going to give you an answer and it may not be the answer that you want to hear but here goes. With 1 pair of dumbbells you are not going to build bulky muscles. In order for your muscles to continue to grow and bulk up you have to overload your muscles.  This is a fancy term for placing more strain on their muscles than they are used to having and so they will adapt by getting bigger. So lets say the dumbells are 45 lb but your body can now handle 55lb but instead you do more reps w/ the 45. In response, your body will simply stop growing.<br>  <br>  In order to bulk up, I would suggest doing compound exercises that recruit several muscle groups at once like barbell squats and benchpress. When I train, I use a low rep range 4-6 reps lifting very heavy and as a result my muscles are much bigger now than they ever have been. I am 6'2, 235 lb and bench 270. So my advice would be to join a gym as the variety of free weights there will give your muscles the overload they need. And you don't need to find a fancy gym w/ all the new machines. Find a local YMCA, they have all the free weights, which are the only things you need to bulk up anyway.|`|AA10681681	dumbbells wont do it.  heavy weights, slow reps builds the muscle....eat every 3 hours and do cardio to burn the calories and lift to build the muscle|`|EIPDUk3Uaa	Your on the right track with dumbbells.  Weight training is the fastest way to increase muscle size.  For your forearms, hold dumbbell at a 90 degree angle to your body elbows tucked in and lift.  Repeat many times.  For upper arms hold dumbbell in hand behind your shoulder blade with elbow pointing straight up into the air, lift forearm up and down repeatedly.  When this becomes very easy, use a heavier weight.
zwKIK25Kaa	Ha that is much worse for you than inhaling. You don't even get the pleasure of the cigarette, but you get nasty teeth and stinky breath. Your doing this just to be cool. Stop now, or try inhaling. You're not gonna get addicted to just putting smoke in your mouth, though. You can get different cancers of the mouth though. So really, if your gonna smoke, just inhale, cuz you'll get cancer either way, and its kind of a decision between 1. stinky breath, rotting teeth, cancer, looking dumb and 2 stinky breath, cancer, fitting in with your 'smoker friends', and actually gettting enjoyment out of your cigarette. I'd choose the latter. Which would be inhaling. Well actually I'd choose the latter latter, which would be not smoking at all. Yeah.|`|9148be4caa737e6fd3ba621d0432dac5aa	no matter what...smoking is addictive and it will kill you and make you suffer.......just stay away|`|WTa76KS9aa	you have to inhale to become addicted but not to get mouth or throat cancer ----- if you don't smoke don't start. it's really hard to stop|`|XgnQDYXXaa	I'm not sure if you will become addicted to cigarettes by holding the smoke in, but it's better safe than sorry just not to do it at all. The smoke and nicotine will still stain your teeth and chances are, plaque will build up. As for how many it takes to become addicted, I've heard it's different for every person, but it can take as little as 1-3 to become addicted.|`|FIJe6bJfaa	yes. it's the idea of you smoking that gets you hooked on the stuff. there isn't a magic number which tells you if you're addicted or not.  the thing is, if you try smoking and continue long enough, you'll eventually like the taste or for whatever other reason, you'll crave the for the stuff and that's when you know that you're addicted.|`|6j1Huqslaa	Yes, you will get addicted and you will be up close and personal with second hand smoke YOU created.<br>  <br>  You would get addicted easily because..........<br>  If you don't know, you betta ask somebody!
AA12286283	omg! i'm 13 (almost 14) too. every time i have like a cookie i think you're gonna regret this and i do! i don't know what to do...i think it's more of a guilt problem. more about being happy with your own body than comparing it to other people. it's always on my mind though what i eat.|`|561aafc6972b74f7f0530f8de80c890caa	yes you do. simple as that. i can eat a lot too and be hungry 2 hours later but i got myself to eat small frequent meals and snacks, that are healthy. plus you have to exercises, even if its taking a walk around your block, doing a quick 10 min work out with 10 lbs weights or going to the gym. and if your 13 i would suggest taking on a sport for high school i did gymnastics for 5 years when i was in high school and loved it. i was in the best shape ever and got to meet friends. try and be more active and not sit at home and watch TV. as you get older your learn more about your body and when you go out, play, exercises, do sports it keeps your mind off of food and hunger and keeps you focus on what your doing right then and there. However if your stomach starts to cramp up while doing these things and u just had a meal have a snack not a whole other meal. oh yea if this is something that just started it could be your period or a growth spirt, because i know i still go threw thoes at times and i'm 20. hope this helps|`|k3cDVT8gaa	No, I wouldn't call that an eating disorder. Because you get hungry so often, you could just have a high metabolism. It's not an eating disorder unless you do it on purpose.
GKAZ8SKVaa	Swelling can be normal if you've been given a lot of fluid, are you making a normal amount of urine?  It sounds like you've been home, and probably moving around a lot if you're a new mother, so your feet still being so EXTREMEMLY swollen sounds unusual.  SOME swelling would be normal, but it sounds like you are talking about a large amount of edema (swelling), and i think that shouldn't be normal, i would go back to the doctor if it really is that bad, and make her/him look at them before saying it's normal.  MAYBE you're "exaggerating" without meaning to, but if it's so much swelling it's hurting, and affecting yoru skin, you need to go back to the doctor and make the doctor actually LOOK at yoru feet before saying it's normal.|`|whHP5cNvaa	If you're very concerned, I would definitely mention it to your doctor again.

If you want to gain weight, eat complex carbs like they're going out of style and plenty of protein to build muscle. Complex carbs include grains, bread and pasta. Protein comes from meat and nuts. Chances are, if you're working out, you're going to gain weight anyway because muscle weighs more than fat.|`|ee01397bfae4bca4cf2787c8c5f214e9aa	If you begin working out you will convert your body's fat into muscle, which weighs more.

I am also trying to gain muscle weight and a pro bodybuilder has told me to eat 4-5 meals a day. You should always feel full. Also, each meal should have a large protein and a large carb source. Chicken and potatoes is an example. <br>  <br>  Good protein sources include: chicken, salmon, beef, cod, tuna, and most other kinds of meat.<br>  <br>  Good carb sources include: Potatoes, Yams, and Whole grain products such as pasta, oatmeal, and rice.<br>  <br>  Also, im not sure if u want to spend the money but taking protein shakes 3 times a day can help gain weight. I would recommend cytogainer by cytosport or trumass by BSN.<br>  <br>  Plus drink water non-stop throughout the day and u should be good.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|evEJxv06aa	you can go waling or jogging in the park and eat less and eat healthy every day.|`|2q1XI0j9aa	do not, I REPEAT do NOT skip meals... that will not help you at all... also since you are so young you need to talk to your parents and express you feel over weight and want to get healthier, they can help/support you    To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , eggs, low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.), shape and woman's health videos. Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!|`|Cnxkli9caa	no dont skip meals thats stoopid it makes you gain weight,,,, just eat less exercise more and drink water - dont eat too many carbs or sugar or saturated fat etcc|`|gF8bbLv1aa	Eating healthy is the best long-term way to lose weight. Eat at least 5 small meals a day, and drink lots of water. The more often you eat throughout the day your metabotolism will generally speed up. The key is "small" meals. Stay away from carbs unless they are complex (wheat bread, brown rice, multigrain foods). Also try to stay away from high fat foods, and sugar. Another key factor in staying on your diet is to indulge every once in a while. If you can go 4-5 days eating healthy, then you can take a day to treat yourself to something you want to eat.   It also wont hurt to start a workout regiment. If you have alot of weight to lose start out slow on cardio workouts (jogging,biking, speed walking, swimming etc.) and before you know it you will be in excellent shape.   Keep in mind that losing weight doesnt happen overnight. It takes time and dedication. Just keep up healthy eating habits, and workout and you will do fine. Good luck!|`|b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout. At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!

There are three simple ways <br>  you can begin to modify: reduce calories, reduce sodium, and reduce fat. For example, by substituting a glass of <br>  water for a carbonated beverage, you can cut approximately 150 calories or more, depending on how much is consumed.<br>   Even if it were fruit juice instead of water, you would still reduce calories by approximately 50 - 100..<br>  what causes these unwanted gains in weight and bodyfat? There are three possible reasons this can happen: <br>  (1) Eat late at night (2) Exceed your normal caloric intake (3) Lack of exercise or physical activity. <br>   best way to speed up the metabolism is by increasing meal frequency.

As long as you are brushing at least 2 times a day with a soft toothbrush for 2 minutes and flossing once a day you should have it covered. I do like the listerine though too. Also, if you get sick either toss your toothbrush or soak it in listerine to kill the bacteria. <br>  Happy homecare!<br>  JAMRDH - a dental hygienist|`|AA10060594	Floss first because it loosens all the food & plaque from your teeth.

ls1JbwGpaa	Some guys do develop breast enlargement during their teen years due to normal hormonal changes (gynecomastia if you want to look it up for more information).<br>  But by 18 years old, the hormones should have sorted everything out and the breast enlargement should reverse if it's going to.  Being overweight will make the situation worse since fat "aromatizes" testosterone to estradiol so you get higher levels of circulating female hormones which effect breast tissue.<br>  You should see a doctor to confirm that nothing is wrong with your hormonal balance (it's not common, but it HAS to be ruled out if you haven't done it already).<br>  If everything is normal on blood tests, and you have excessive breast tissue, then plastic surgery is really the only option to change their appearance.|`|AA11085415	Talk with a DR|`|Yiderhmoaa	If this means you are getting breasts life a womans its not as uncommon as you think.

0370fd46af40ff0a67a8182e1d0051a2aa	Find the root cause of your depression.  Drugs won't help with depression caused by behavior causes or physical injuries.  There are many things that can cause depression, and finding the root cause is the first step to any treatment program.  I notice you didn't mention any therapy programs or analysis.  Have you tried talking to a professional therapist?|`|AA10110751	Don't listen to people who suggest home medicines or over the counter products for a depression... they do not know what they are talking about. <br>  Your best bet is to consult a neurologist or a psychiatrist (I mean, a qualified physician). Depression is a serious organic disease that can be successfully treated. There are MANY antidepressant drugs, so that your depression was resistant to two of them means not much. Additionally, it must be checked your compliance to the previous treatment, as well as the appropriateness of the dosage schema. Remember that it can take about one month or more to reach therapeutically effective levels of the antidepressant drug in your body... so, my suggestion is to pay a visit to a doctor (either neurologist or psychiatrist) and ask for a proper drug therapy for depression.<br>  <br>  Make an appointment with your doctor now!!!

The good news is that it is also quite treatable.<br>  <br>  There are two main categories of treatment for depression.  Some favor one over the other but many others think the combination of the two is the best course of action and I’ve always found that to be true myself.  The main thing is to find a treatment regimen that is right for you.  Don’t give up, keep trying until you find one that works.<br>  <br>  Psychopharmacology is depression treatment using antidepressants.  There are countless anti-depressants out there and what works for one person doesn’t always work for another.  <br>  <br>  Side effects are one of the drawbacks of anti-depressants.  But the newer drugs coming out tend to have less side effects and many say are more efficient at what they are intended for.  Anti-depressants alleviate the symptoms of depression but don’t heal the depression itself.  On the other hand they often help those with severe depression be more receptive to the psychotherapy that will get to the root causes of depression.<br>  <br>  Psychotherapy is depression treatment through one of the psychodynamic or psychoanalytic therapies, or talk therapy.  There are many types of psychotherapy.<br>  <br>  Psychoanalytical therapy is one of those.  In this type of a person’s past is delved into as well as dreams, habits, defense mechanisms, etc.  It tends to be a time consuming form of therapy but also thought to be one of the most effective.<br>  <br>  Interpersonal therapy, on the other hand, tends to be short term.  It usually focuses on current issues, such as problems in relationships with friends and family, that may be causing a person’s depression<br>  <br>  Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on the way the patient thinks and behaves and tries to help the patient change unproductive behaviors and thoughts.<br>  <br>  Family therapy can be helpful for those living in a family situation.  It treats the entire family, not just the depressed person.  It can teach the family members how best to support the depressed person without exacerbating the situation.<br>  <br>  There are of course other forms of therapy not mentioned above, including those form of therapies that are considered “alternative”.  It should also be noted that a combination of the above mentioned therapies might be what works best for a depressed individual.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck on your road to healing and hope that this information will prove helpful to you.

What works for some people does not work for others.  Talk therapy works for some.  Medication works for others.  Yet others prefer psychoanalysis.<br>  <br>  What I do know is what works for me.  I suffered Major Depressive Disorder as diagnosed by a psychologist.  It means depressive tendencies with suicidal thoughts.  When I started taking SAM-e, a supplement largely popular in Europe, my depression ended.  I still take it.  It isn't a cure, but I live without depression.  I suggest consulting a psychiatrist or psychologist about it.  Especially if you are still taking anti-depressants.  There are risks when used in tandem with anti-depressants.<br>  <br>  Anyway, SAM-e is an over-the-counter supplement available at most pharmacies.  At Walgreens, it goes about 50 pills for $40.  At Sam's Club, it goes 90 pills for about $40.  You would take two a day.<br>  <br>  SAM-e is a supplement the body naturally produces.  For whatever reason, people with depression have less of it.  It assists the body in cell-replication, specifically where DNA replication takes place.  They believe it has some kind of interaction with the same neural stimulators that anti-depressants work with (dopamine, serotonin).|`|wd3YtSAzaa	Depression?

bf621e05dd1c4f89ff36b9fdce162254aa	The MOST you should lose in a month is about 8 pounds, certainly not 30 pounds.  It is NOT safe or healthy to lose 5 pounds a week, you will be placing your health at risk and probably put it all back on later, plus more.<br>  <br>  If you are exercising all the time and cutting back on food and nothing is happening then either your exercise is not of enough intensity, or you are eating too little food/not enough of the right food, or a combination of both.  <br>  <br>  Too little food can actually cause your body to stop losing weight as it goes into famine mode, thinking you are starving it.<br>  <br>  Also how long have you been exercising?  It takes about 12 weeks for you to really get noticable improvements to your body shape if you are just starting out.<br>  <br>  How tall are you?  140 pounds is not heavy for an average height woman. At a height of 5ft 6in that gives you a BMI of 22.6 which is pretty much perfect.<br>  <br>  I see you have added you are only 13 - at 13 I was my full adult height.  You may think you have too much fat on you, but you may not at all, depending on your height.  I have given a link to a BMI calculator below for you to calculate your own.  Also calculate what it would be if you were 110 pounds - you may find you would fall into the underweight category, which is not healthy.  You may have seen a model died recently as a result.<br>  <br>  All you can do is exercise regularly at a high enough intensity to sweat for about 40 - 50 minutes say 4 - 5 times a week and eat a healthy, balanced diet of around 1500 calories a day - you are still developing, so you need adequate and good nutrition.  Drink plenty of water, avoid fried foods totally, plenty of fresh steamed vegetables and 2 serves of fruit a day.  Ban soft drinks and cordial from your life.<br>  <br>  I can't stress enough that your long term health is MUCH more important than June 23 - it may not seem so now, but it will later on when you are trying to have a family and other things that still await you in life!|`|AA11064009	Don't.

Cutting back on food lowers your metabolism, thus making your body work much harder with much less energy.  You need to take breaks and give your body rest.  Also, you may consider trying new or changing some of your exercise activities.  It seems like if one tries harder the less results you may get.  Try not to focus too much and lengthen your duration to at least two to two and a half months, three or four months would be better.  The longer it takes to lose weight, the less likely you gain it back.  Good luck!|`|6UT1xAUBaa	It is soooo unhealthy to lose 30lbs in one month.. Any doctor would tell you that. The big picture you should be looking at is how healthy you are.. not how much you weigh. You're only 13, if guys or women are looking at you like they want your body then they're probably sex offenders. A healthy approach to losing weight and being healthy is to guarantee yourself at least a and hour of exercise every couple of days. Some people might only suggest less or more.. you might wanna check with a doctor. You shouldnt exhaust your body. Also, be sure to plan a diet that includes all food groups.

Don't starve yourself, just make smarter choices. I know you said you're already cutting back, but perhaps the foods you're eating aren't as beneficial for your body as they could be. Start reading labels, and aim for high protein and low calories. The protein will help keep you full imbetween meals. Also, try eating 6 small meals everyday instead of just 3 big ones, this should help speed up your metabolism.<br>  <br>  Find a workout that you really enjoy doing and can stick to in a daily routine. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|c46c702d45b20699e529dae54a19cc74aa	If you willing to spend money.<br>  Go visist a professional in weight management and they will use technology and adjust your eating and exercise habit to give you the prefect result.<br>  <br>  If not try my method:<br>  Exercise but nothing happen mean you do it somewhere wrong.<br>  Try excercise for at least 30min everyday.Not jogging but sprinting. do FAST running not jogging.

Stretch marks are caused when that area of the body grows very quickly (like when a girl goes through puberty and suddenly has breasts); men get stretch marks too, just not as many and not really in areas that get a lot of attention. <br>  <br>  Remember that stretch marks will usually fade on their own, unless they are very severe. I went from a B cup to a D cup over one summer and had terrible stretch marks, none of which are visible today (roughly five years later).|`|AA12101092	Well girls with some minor stretchmarks isn't a prob for me, but if a girl has serious strechmarks around my age something isn't right.

This way your skin has the chance to keep up.<br>  And: use oils everyday on your body. This way your skin stays moisturised and doesn't stretch to it's limits.<br>  Eating healthy is also important.

The sugary sodas however will really only help... although not the most healthy way to put on weight, the sugar in the soda will trigger an insulin response in your body which will signal it to store calories as fat... Just keep eating, you'll get there... try throwing a few protein shakes into your diet, maybe 3 a day, mixed with milk, and take in plenty of carbs... start your day with a huge bowl of oatmeal, a couple eggs, some toast, natural peanut butter... eat atleast 6 times a day, have a weight gainer shake before you go to bed... there are lots of options. Last year I was body building heavily, even with the heavy training schedule I had little trouble putting on weight, I'm 5'10", at that point I was 235lbs and eating about 6000 calories a day... just remember that you need to eat more than you burn, 3500 calories is a pound of fat, lift weights but avoid cardio, and you should see some progress.<br>  Good luck!|`|JuTrUmw9aa	NO STINKEN WAY. infact you will most likely gain the wait you won't! but be carful, too much can resulve to kiddny stones...stones in your kiddny!!!   <br>  at leats thats what happened to my big bro. but he's fine now.|`|b6XkDVjHaa	it depends upon how your individual body uses the foods different people have different reactions to the same food. . . if you have a high adrenal type then soda would speed up metabolism but if your system is more run by say your thyroid then it would slow down your metabolism
zqFKbSA1aa	Dr. Curran-Celentano recommends that women consume six servings of protein-rich foods every day.

SlfEINx6aa	Is any other food or drink reported to have as many health benefits as green tea? The Chinese have known about the medicinal benefits of green tea since ancient times, using it to treat everything from headaches to depression.  In her book Green Tea: The Natural Secret for a Healthier Life, Nadine Taylor states that green tea has been used as a medicine in China for at least 4,000 years.  <br>  <br>  Today, scientific research in both Asia and the west is providing hard evidence for the health benefits long associated with drinking green tea. For example, in 1994 the Journal of the National Cancer Institute published the results of an epidemiological study indicating that drinking green tea reduced the risk of esophageal cancer in Chinese men and women by nearly sixty percent. University of Purdue researchers recently concluded that a compound in green tea inhibits the growth of cancer cells. There is also research indicating that drinking green tea lowers total cholesterol levels, as well as improving the ratio of good (HDL) cholesterol to bad (LDL) cholesterol.<br>  <br>  To sum up, here are just a few medical conditions in which drinking green tea is reputed to be helpful: <br>  <br>  cancer <br>  rheumatoid arthritis <br>  high cholesterol levels <br>  cariovascular disease <br>  infection <br>  impaired immune function<br>  <br>  To date, the only negative side effect reported from drinking green tea is insomnia due to the fact that it contains caffeine.   However, green tea contains less caffeine than coffee: there are approximately thirty to sixty mg. of caffeine in six - eight ounces of tea, compared to over one-hundred mg. in eight ounces of coffee|`|zqFKbSA1aa	It is suggested by laboratory research that polyphenols, found in green tea can reduce the risk of skin cancer. <br>  <br>  Polyphenols are antioxidents which protect cells form damage that can be caused by radiation and toxins.

This is the fastest I have ever lost with other diets like Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Medifast, Slimfast etc…. Cleansing works by removing impurities from your body.  You get impurities from your food (pesticides, preservatives, food additives, colorings) water, chemicals, pollution, medications, alcohol, hormones that the animals you eat were fed etc….YUCK!  The impurites get coated with fat and remain in your body.  To remove the fat, you have to remove the impurites.  This system worked for me, maybe it can work for you too.  You can check out the website or call this toll free number 1-877-587-4647 for more info.  The program is not cheap, but it is worth every penny since it works and keeps you motivated.  Good luck!

But it is because you had sex before your period.|`|521bee986ea74e76a0d467094069f511aa	i was supposed to have my period on the 6th but it didnt come until 2 days ago it just stress<br>  go to the doctor to reassure yourself........<br>  its okay i understand i freaked that i was late too|`|AA11722373	Calm down and stop worrying for right now. Stress can and will cause it to be late.|`|kUKs85G9aa	Just because you were protected doesn't mean that you can't get pregnant.  I think you need to calm down and stop worrying.  Stress can make your period irregular.  If you are concerned about being pregnant, go to your doctor and get a test done.|`|rUg5YwxNaa	If you are using a condom there is really no chance of getting pregnant unless you come in contact with his ejaculation. I would suggest birth control also if you arent trying to get pregnant. You could be late because of stress, sometimes heavy excercise can also cause you to be late. Sometimes I get mine on schedule or 3 days after. I would go to the health department, get a free pregnancy test then ask them about a type of birth control good for you. But I dont think you are pregnant.
kUKs85G9aa	Yes, but it's usually light.<br>  <br>  One of my sister's friends had her period the whole way through her pregnancy.  It was regular and flowed like normal.  She didn't know she was pregnant until she started giving birth.  My sister said the baby was pushed really far up in the uterus and that's why her friend never suspected she was pregant (besides the fact that she was getting her period).  That would be scary, but it's incredibly rare.  If you think you're pregnant, go to your doctor.|`|UjzvCcmtaa	yes|`|fee3f142413bcc53909fcd2f788a9afbaa	Yeah... I've heard of women being pregnant and having up to 2 periods. My mom did with my sister.<br>  <br>  Scary, huh?<br>  <br>  At least for those of us NOT wanting to get pregnant.|`|lpMADedqaa	even though the first sign of pregnancy in most women is missed period yes you can be pregnant and have your period...a friend went 3 months with her period until she found out she was pregnant for other side effects|`|t0ElnzC9aa	Yes, apparently so. You can also be pregnant and have spotting during the whole of the pregnancy. If you're affraid that you're pregnant take a test just in case. If you're under 20 you can do one free at a family planning clinic/your doctors

Cl9si6mBaa	Melanie, you are not the only one, and yes that is from experience... it really bites doesnt it? you need to talk to someone....it isnt your fault... that was hard for me too... I cant stress enough how important it is to find some trusted adult and tell them what happened!!! you can email me if you want to...?|`|rf3nJ0xxaa	You are not alone. Its very common  but people don't talk about it alot because it makes them uncomfortable. People don't want to acknowledge that something so vile was done to a child. It is definitely not your fault, and the only way to get better is to get it out and deal with the feelings. It happened to me and from what I understand about half of American women will have been either molested or raped in their lifetime. That's a sad statistic. You didn't do anything wrong.|`|MbAupQALaa	Youre not the only one, many people have been through it.  I know how hard it is.  Stop blaming yourself, it is not your fault.  Find a counselor or someone you trust to talk to.  It often helps to get it out.  If you don't feel you can do that, then write about your feelings.  Sometimes it helps to write a letter to the molester - don't mail it, but just writing it can help.  good luck and God bless|`|kUKs85G9aa	You're not alone and it wasn't your fault.  You need to talk to a someone you trust about what happened.  Sometimes it helps to get it out.

GKAZ8SKVaa	8 dollars an hour or so, but it probably depends on where you get a job.
AA10766729	There is a small possibility of it happening; however since you've tried sex and doing it yourself, chances are that the speculum won't do much either.<br>  <br>  BTW, it's not necessarily considered "surgery" to have the hymen breached by the doctor; they simply take a scalpel and cut the hymen and its done (the procedure is called a "Hymenotomy").  So if you're worried about the "surgery" aspect, don't.  Discuss this with your doctor...you may have a rather common condition where the hymen is thick or inelastic (inflexible).<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6d9b0dc26c4a5a91ffa60520f03c77c2aa	its possible. but if your not sexually active theres no reson to do it|`|GR4daTMhaa	weird...now this is something ive never heard of before...interesting...oh hi...|`|VfA3OoU9aa	NO!

kUKs85G9aa	It's always a possibility.  Some days the chance of getting pregnant is lower than other days, but there's still that chance.|`|vpya9hhOaa	it's very possible.  sperm can live inside of you for up to 2 days.  they sit there in the fallopian tube to wait for the egg to be released, slowly dying off.  If you don't want to get pregnant use a condom or don't have sex.  Also, it is very difficult to predict the exact time of ovulation unless you know your body VERY well.  SO please, use protection.|`|a4c4fad5ac68d2d591ed33ddd060d97eaa	Let's hope not, you type as if you're 10 years old.|`|oc8YcBpWaa	Yes ...  you can, it's possible. "Sperm can actually live in a woman's body for up to a week!

sxuxZrnDaa	Well mostly everything in moderation. Since I don't know your current size or activity level or what your eat now. Just try not to eat things with lots of sugar like ice cream and cookies. If you already do that try more fruits and veggies. Also try to eat 6 small meals instead of 3 large. This will keep your metabolism going without storing as much food. Depending on how much you exercise now, I would up it 20 min a day. And in a week see if you can up it to 40 min. a day. Do anything cardio or aerobics. (something to make you sweat)|`|fni1IDLJaa	if you want to lose 30 pounds in 3 months, the best thing to do is to go on a low calorie diet. you can eat cheesecake and still lose weight on this diet!

zMD0VeOmaa	I believe the Kinsey report is correct based on sex information that I've heard.|`|5HOMRUeMaa	The show is wrong.  There are many factors that determine a person's flaccid size, and none of them have anything to do with erect size.|`|AA11262556	Kinsey is much closer to being right. I ve seen on a website (not a picture, just information) that some people with a bigger flacid penis have the erect penis not getting bigger too much and just going up. Allso some people have extremely small penises and are very large erect penises.|`|CGGQpJaBaa	You dunno how big erect it is from looking at it flaccid I've read.|`|u34yl4Byaa	I really don't think The Learning Channel report is right.  <br>  <br>  Have you ever heard the expression "I'm a grower, not a shower"?  This means that a guy's penis is unimpressive when flacid but large when erect.  As opposed to a man who has a large limp penis (a shower). <br>  <br>  Some of the biggest penises I have ever seen didn't look like much when they weren't "at attention", but as soon as they got hard, well, move over, or it might knock you over.  So it takes a lot of blood to go from zero to hero like that.  <br>  <br>  On the opposite side of the coin, once I was with this guy who had a very impressive looking limp dick.  But when he got it up, it was the exact same size!  Sure, it was angled differently since it was erect, but length-wise, minimal change.  I don't think it took much blood to make it just point up instead of down.

Dentre outras atribui??es, é responsável pela limpeza, umidifica??o e aquecimento do ar inspirado.<br>  Para exercer esta fun??o corretamente, o nariz possui um complexo mecanismo de defesa, o qual, ao entrar em contato com alguma substancia tóxica desencadeia uma resposta que impedirá esta substancia de alcan?ar os pulm?es. Através do surgimento de obstru??o nasal teremos o bloqueio da passagem deste agente agressor, e dos espirros e coriza a remo??o desta substancia. Isto é normal e todas as pessoas ao entrarem em contato com algumas substancias toxicas apresentam estes sintomas. <br>  Uma pessoa quando fica gripada apresenta obstru??o nasal, espirros e coriza, pois seu organismo está tentando protegê-la, impedindo que os vírus alcancem seus pulm?es através do ar.<br>  Alergia, na realidade, n?o significa falta de defesa do organismo, mas muito pelo contrário, é uma defesa exagerada contra agentes que n?o s?o potencialmente agressivos ao ser humano. Ou seja, uma pessoa alérgica é aquela que é hiperreativa a determinada substancia que para uma pessoa normal n?o despertaria nenhuma resposta. O sistema imunológico das pessoas alérgicas, por características genéticas, interpreta que determinada substancia é tóxica, e que ele precisa proteger o organismo de sua entrada. é por isto que algumas pessoas, convivem normalmente com fatores que causam a alergia, como a poeira de casa, sem ter sintomas, ao passo que outras pessoas ao entrarem em contato com esta mesma poeira podem ter rinite e asma.<br>  O paciente alérgico n?o nasce hiperreativo (com alergia), mas sim com a capacidade de sensibilizar-se a determinado fator. Tornar-se sensível significa passar a ter uma resposta de defesa a uma substancia que antes era tolerada. Isto significa que podemos conviver com determinada substancia por muitos anos, e vir a desenvolver sintomas apenas tardiamente.<br>  Esta característica é herdada dos pais. Quando um homem e uma mulher alérgicos tem um filho, a chance desta crian?a ser alérgica é de cerca de 50%. Por outro lado, mesmo que nenhum dos pais apresentem alergia, a crian?a ainda assim pode vir a ter.<br>  Este tipo de alergia pode se apresentar como rinite, conjuntivite, asma e alguns tipos de alergia de pele. Porém a forma mais comum é a rinite. Cerca de 10 a 25% das pessoas sofrem de rinite alérgica.<br>  <br>  2- Quais os sintomas da Rinite Alérgica?<br>  Os sintomas que os pacientes portadores de rinite alérgica apresentam s?o obstru??o nasal (entupimento), coriza, espirros (algumas vezes o paciente espirra mais 20 vezes seguidas) e coceira no nariz. Esta coceira pode ser na garganta ou nos olhos. <br>  Além disto a rinite alérgica, pode causar outros problemas, como otites (inflama??o dos ouvidos), sinusites (inflama??o de cavidades existentes na face) e roncos (pelo entupimento do nariz) que faz com que o paciente n?o durma bem a noite. O paciente só vai apresentar estes sintomas quando estiver em contato com as substancias aos quais é alérgico. Estas substancias recebem o nome de alérgenos. Quanto maior o contato, mais intensos tendem a ser os sintomas.<br>  Todos os doentes apresentam estes sintomas minutos após o contato com o alérgeno, e cerca de metade deles ter?o novamente sintomas cerca de 4 a 6 horas depois.<br>  <br>  3- Quais as causas da Rinite Alérgica?<br>  Muitas substancias podem causar alergia como a poeira de casa, pólens e alguns alimentos. Aqui no Brasil é a poeira domiciliar é o fator mais importante. Ela é constituída por descama??o da pele humana e de animais, restos de pelos de c?es e gatos, restos de barata e outros insetos, fungos, bactérias e organismos microscópicos que s?o chamados ácaros (família dos aracnídeos). O principal fator da poeira que causa alergia é o ácaro. Existem vários ácaros, e o que mais freqüentemente esta relacionado à alergia é o Dermatophagoides ssp., que significa, aquele que se alimenta de pele. Este é o seu nome pois uma de suas fontes de alimentos é a descama??o da pele. No colch?o de nossas camas e nos móveis estofados que existem em nossas casas encontramos muita descama??o de pele e é exatamente por esta raz?o que nestes locais existe grande quantidade de ácaros. Estes ácaros vivem nas camadas profundas dos tecidos, abra?ados as fibras. Eles n?o s?o capazes de viver sobre uma superfície lisa, como por exemplo nas paredes. <br>  Em S?o Paulo, e outras regi?es do Brasil onde n?o há uma clara defini??o das quatro esta??es do ano, a forma de rinite alérgica que predomina é a causada pelos ácaros, sendo que os doentes, em geral, apresentam sintomas durante o ano inteiro. Em outras regi?es (como no sul do país), na época da primavera, ocorre a poliniza??o das flores, e podemos ter a rinite alérgica da esta??o, chamada nos países do hemisfério norte de febre do feno. Apesar deste nome, n?o existe febre e tampouco o feno é o responsável pelos sintomas. S?o fungos que proliferam nos ma?os de feno as substancias que desencadeiam os sintomas. <br>  Normalmente o paciente com rinite alérgica, apresenta os sintomas quando em contato com o alérgeno, e em geral, estes sintomas s?o proporcionais á quantidade de alérgeno. Na época do inverno, estes pacientes sofrem mais, pois, neste período, s?o usados cobertores e roupas que ficaram guardados por muito tempo, e podem estar cheios de ácaros e fungos. Além disto estes doentes s?o mais susceptíveis a resfriados. Na verdade o resfriado é uma inflama??o do nariz, que irá comprometer os mecanismos de prote??o nasal, com isto facilitando a entrada dos alérgenos. <br>  <br>  4- Como tratar Rinite Alérgica?<br>  O tratamento dos pacientes portadores de rinite alérgica é composto por três pontos fundamentais:<br>  <br>  A- Higiene ambiental.<br>  B- Tratamento medicamentoso.<br>  C- Vacinas anti-alérgicas.<br>  <br>  A- Higiene ambiental.<br>  A forma mais simples de tratar alergia é evitar o contato com a substancia que desencadeia os sintomas. Por exemplo, se o paciente apresenta obstru??o nasal, coriza e espirros quando ingere determinado alimento, o mais fácil a fazer é simplesmente n?o comê-lo. Infelizmente, a principal causa de rinite alérgica é o ácaro, e n?o é fácil evitar o contato com ele.<br>  Algumas medidas simples podem ser adotadas, e ir?o diminuir a quantidade destes insetos. A casa e principalmente o quarto onde o doente dorme devem ser limpos com bastante freqüência. Infelizmente a vassoura e espanador de pó apenas espalham o pó pelo ambiente. Os aspiradores s?o capazes de reter alguma sujeira, porém normalmente sue filtro n?o é desenvolvido para limpar o ar por completo, e portanto muitas vezes o que ele faz é uma pulveriza??o de poeira no ambiente. Aspiradores com filtros especiais e de alta eficiência existem, porém tem um custo muito elevado. No caso de n?o existir carpete ou tapetes no ch?o, o uso de pano úmido na limpeza é uma forma bastante eficaz para remover a poeira. <br>  Um ponto importante a ser considerado, é a existência de uma boa ventila??o na casa e no quarto, e se possível ambientes ensolarados, para evitar o surgimento de bolor (fungos).<br>  Além disto, o ideal é que n?o existam carpetes, tapetes, cortinas, bichos de pelúcia ou outros móveis ou utensílios que possam acumular poeira. Ainda, deve-se evitar o uso e contato com travesseiros e almofadas de penas ou outros materiais que possam causar alergia. A utiliza??o de capas protegendo os colch?es e travesseiros, assim como de substancias para eliminar os ácaros do ambiente apresentam eficácia quando aplicados corretamente.<br>  Estas medidas de higiene n?o acabam com os ácaros e outros alérgenos, mas diminuem a sua quantidade.<br>  Além destas mediadas de higiene ambiental, onde o objetivo é reduzir a quantidade de alérgenos, é muito importante que os doentes fiquem afastados de de outras substancias capazes de irritar o nariz. Cheiros de perfumes, produtos de limpeza, produtos para deixar os ambientes com cheiro agradável, fuma?a de cigarro, tintas, inseticidas e polui??o, s?o alguns exemplos de substancias capazes de irritar o nariz, e desencadear sintomas. Outros fatores inespecíficos como as mudan?as bruscas de temperatura, frio e umidade do ar s?o também prejudiciais aos doentes. <br>  <br>  B- Tratamento medicamentoso.<br>  A critério médico, se estas medidas n?o forem suficientes para controlar os sintomas do paciente, poderá ser receitado medicamentos. <br>  Existem dois grandes grupos de drogas que podem ser usadas. Um tipo funciona preventivamente e outro apenas alivia os sintomas.<br>  Do ponto de vista farmacológico, dispomos de descongestionantes, anti-histamínicos, estabilizadores de membranas, e corticosteróides. Cada uma destas drogas atuam de forma diferente, e nenhuma é isenta de efeitos colaterais que algumas vezes podem ser graves. Por isto, o ideal, é n?o realizar auto medica??o e procurar seu médico.<br>  <br>  C- Vacinas anti-alérgicas<br>  Quando o tratamento feito nestas condi??es (higiene ambiental e medicamentos) falha, pode-se associar o uso de vacinas anti-alérgicas. Este tratamento é longo, porém quando feito corretamente, diminuí a sensibilidade do doente àquela substancia ao qual ele era alérgico. Muitas vezes chegamos ao ponto onde n?o há mais necessidade do uso de medicamentos.<br>  Pizzaiollouco|`|AA1iVPuUaa	A rinite é uma inflama??o das mucosas do nariz, que aparece de forma recorrente e atinge cerca de 30% da popula??o.

Algumas vezes a doen?a é acompanhada de febre.<br>  <br>  Agentes causadores<br>  A rinite pode ser provocada devido a rea??o alérgica à poeira, produtos químicos, cigarros, remédios etc. Também pode ocorrer devido a deformidades na parte interna do nariz.<br>  <br>  Muitas substancias podem causar alergia como a poeira de casa, pólens e alguns alimentos.

uz0n8fRIaa	Maybe if you describe the pain, people with some medical experience could help you out. <br>  <br>  As far as the tampon thing goes... A couple of decades ago, people were all freaked out about tampons because women who left them in too long (or used them when not on their period, don't ask me why they'd do that though) got Toxic Shock Syndrome. Now, if you read the information sheet in your box of tampons, it tells you how to avoid TSS. Still, because of the scare, some women were permanently convinced that tampons were bad.<br>  <br>  Personally I find pads disgusting. When I was in middle school, I will never forget this one day when a good friend of mine walked down the aisle in our classroom and that poor girl absolutely reeked because she was wearing a pad. Those things can only get so saturated before they need changing and when they get that way an odor is sometimes apparent. Yes, tampons become saturated too, except it is internal so it doesn't have the same odor.<br>  <br>  So, as for you, I would insist that your mother take you to the gynecologist. Pain and cramping could be because of a plethora of reasons. A friend of mine had severe pain for at least a year before she went and got checked and it turned out to be ovarian cysts that had to be removed. The sooner you find out, the better. You will feel better and so will your mom.|`|3b0102904486c04ba8dbbf96a080bdd4aa	Its cramps, not from tampons. Take spme Motrin or Midol, and move around. Walk, jog, do sit ups.|`|40ZdU24Iaa	Yeah, see the doctor. They'll give you medicine (painkillers, or possibly birth control-it cuts back on cramps A LOT) and explain to your mom that it's not the tampons.|`|hGfMMrAHaa	she will listen. you sit with her and explain your problem. she will herself take you to the doctor.|`|2cdyjlJfaa	Use pads and tell her you still have cramps. Ask her to buy you some Midol and if it works, great and if it doesn't, tell her you NEED to see a gyno.|`|2rwWjL08aa	Tampons will not cause pelvic pain in healthy women if they are inserted properly. The fact that you are currently not wearing a tampon and describe the same pain is not normal. Follow your gut-feeling, you do need to see a physician for an internal exam.|`|6Oo9xWNyaa	is it in the inner part of the vigina, like your cervix that has the pain? It could be dysplasia. Precancerous cells on your cervix. When i noticed the pains...i went to the gyno and sure enough...i have mild dysplasia. If left untreated...it could become cervical cancer in a bout 10 years.|`|AA11144058	It could be if you are using tampons that are more than what you need. Make sure the tampon absorbancy you're using is consistent with what you need.<br>  <br>  Going to the gyno wouldn't hurt. If you're over 16 you should be going yearly anyway.<br>  <br>  Tell your mom your health isn't worth arguing over tampons and that you need to see a doctor.|`|AaVK3Hayaa	best advice is to go to the gyno and see what he or she says|`|b639f61d656c58882c6d485d251a34e1aa	Yea, go see a doc. Tell her you stopped using them just to go see one then tell the doc the truth. If she was wrong she shouldn't be mad.|`|uolBzVyZaa	At this point, you don't need her to listen. Set up the appointment to the gyno yourself if you are concerned. It could be something that needs attention. Good call in asking this question. Some places don't need a parent, including your doctor (most), and planned parenthood. Grab your insurance card and set that up now! Er, well, tomorrow when the doctor's office is open. :)|`|ZRScOoU7aa	If you are on your period (i'm assuming you are), then the cramps are normal and not associated with wearing tampons. They CAN be, but in your case I think it is very unlikely. Every woman who has a period gets cramp at some time in their life - I had terrible cramps this morning and could hardly move, I was crying and doubling up in pain - and I don't even wear tampons.<br>  If you have ever left a tampon inside your body for more than 8 hours, then unfortunately you must get yourself to the doctors immediately because it could be Toxic shock syndrome (often referred to as TSS) and your mom could be right after all. But for now I wouldn't worry.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped =) x|`|0cd14558b59bca02f88377d3fee26645aa	Damn, I don't think tampons cause cramps. Tell your mom what you feel, better safe than sorry.

RhPNV1ohaa	When self is the center of our lives - our purpose is to please ourselves.  It is strange how self pleasing makes a person so unhappy and depressed.  I used to live to please myself.  I often thought of dying or causing myself to die.  Because when I lived for me - I was unhappy and lacking any real purpose.<br>  <br>  What changed my life around was when I decided to live to please God and be a blessing to my fellow men.  That is why I'm here writing to you.  God has given me meaning and purpose and I find His love better than my food or my past pleasures.  He is helping me to live for Him and I do enjoy it better than living to please me.  <br>  <br>  You wonder why you cry at the littleest things? and get soo depressed?  It is because self is the center of your life.  I challenge you to ask God for something to do that will please him and He will show you someone who needs your help in the person of humanity and it will be your joy to help them.  I don't know who they will be but God has many good suprises waiting thay you will get so happy doing you will forget all about yourself in your delight in helping others.|`|08181f5f2dbe671cdb63e0ab5fe09282aa	Well first of all try to get the idea out of your head that death is the answer.

I have been lifting for over twenty years, I don’t know that I could ever increase my lifts another 50 lbs.

There are much better tasting ones that cost less and are just as effective (but they have cholesterol).|`|RQb30Hf9aa	They say 100% to make people buy it.|`|9206ed209c9df6b0ce28d5168357f66faa	Well simply put, it is Whey protein meaning it is based off animal proteins.

There are plenty of acne medications out there, but I wouldn't suggest going out and buying whatever. I recently starting using ProActiv. It didn't work for my friend, so she gave me what she had so I could try it and it worked. <br>  If you know of anyone that has anything you can try, you should do that. You don't want to spend a lot of money trying things that might not work. If worse comes to worse, you should find a dermitaligist that can specify why your acne is so bad.|`|aCvpwSWlaa	I noticed that mine breaks out when i sweat, so after i go to the gym, i wash my back & that seemed to help. Also when i eat sugar or grease i get acne, i know dermatologists say it has nothing to do with it but i would put money on it that that is a cause for me, so maybe something in your diet too.
kUKs85G9aa	Her mother should be the one to tell her all about the facts of life, not you.  She's probably just curious, which is normal at that age.|`|AA11280073	I would tell her mom. She might not appreciate your giving her daughter that information.|`|QBczVclsaa	mmm  this is a difficult one but if she isnt tht close to her parents and u dont think her mom will tell her about this stuff then i think you should sit her down and tell her because she needs to know before she starts her period and then she ALWAYS nows she can come to you for help and advice, if you do decide to tell her, just have a chat to her mom afterwards to let her now.|`|98b1760405a24492ecbff172b2ef1cdeaa	thats her mothers job, say nothing and talk to your sister|`|DFIIR7jAaa	i think anyone in your position would be shocked! if she hasn't started her period yet then i don't think you should tell her, sh probably just heard the word somewhere and is curious. when her parents come to pick her up quietly tell them what she asked and i'm sure they will take it from there. hope this helps!|`|k5IUoYJpaa	Leave the parenting to the parents. Just tell her that if she wants to know, she needs to talk to her parents about it. That will not only allow her parents to be in control of what their daughter knows about this delicate issue, but it will make both you and her parents and her hopefully happy about your course of action.|`|58c51b751ec4e2e12532178f119cc489aa	sit her down, and ask her why she wants to know, and ask if something is going on.  And then tell her that she should talk to her mom about this, and she would be happy to answer any questions she has about that area.|`|og056xD9aa	She's probably curious.  Maybe some of her friends have started and she's heard them talking.  Don't just blow her off - keep the lines of communication open.  An aunt is a good person to talk to if you feel too uncomfortable or too embarrassed to talk to your mom.  Ask her if she's talked to her mother about it -- if she has, ask her what her mother said; she may still be a little confused and wanting a 2nd opinion.  If she hasn't, then tell her that that is a question she should be asking her mother.

Keep in mind that this category corresponds to the adult overweight category and doesn't simply that your child might become overweight later, as many people misinterpret it. See our article on Understanding BMI for more information.<br>  <br>  See the notes on BMI below if you have any questions...<br>  <br>  To interpret your child's BMI, you can also check the Girls BMI Growth Charts to see if your child has a healthy bmi. Just plot your childs age and BMI and see what the percentile is. (See our guide to Understanding Growth Charts if you are not sure what to do.)<br>  <br>  Remember, a child is considered to be:<br>  <br>      * overweight if they have a BMI over the 95th percentile for their age<br>      * at risk of becoming overweight if they have a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile for their age<br>      * underweight if they have a BMI under the 5th percentile for their age<br>  <br>  And a child has a healthy BMI if it is between the 5th and 85th percentile.<br>  Try the BMI Calculator Again<br>  <br>  If your child is overweight, how much weight do they need to lose?

A body mass index that is between the 85th and 95th percentile for his or her age puts your child at risk of becoming overweight. Since body mass index doesn't directly measure body fat, it is possible to be overweight but not obese. Some kids who are very athletic and have a large muscle mass, may be overweight, but if they do not have excess body fat, then they do not need help with weight loss. However, the vast majority of children who are overweight are also obese and do need help with weight management.<br>  <br>  Being underweight or at risk of being underweight means that your child has a body mass index for his age that is lower than the 5th percentile. This can be normal, especially if your child has been growing and developing normally, has a healthy diet, and is active and energetic. However, being underweight can also be a sign of a problem and deserves a full medical exam, especially if your child is not gaining weight or has recently lost weight, has diarrhea, vomiting, poor appetite, an unhealthy diet, or a low energy level. Children that are underweight can also be at risk of having eating disorders, especially if your child is overly concerned about losing weight, has a poor self body image, exercises excessively, has stopped having periods, or is using laxatives to lose weight. You should see your doctor if you suspect that your child has a medical condition causing him to be underweight or if you suspect an eating disorder.<br>  <br>  For adults, a body mass index:<br>  <br>      * over 30 is considered obese.<br>      * between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.<br>      * between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered a healthy bmi.<br>      * under 18.5 is consider underweight.|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	your very young to worry about your weight <br>  forget about it - you are not
U66Bp4Wwaa	bro if your benching 265 already then your doing great.  especially for only being 16.|`|bXqGa139aa	That’s actually two questions. If you want to increase your power, specifically your bench press, then don’t lift with the idea of loosing fat. Do cardio exercises for that. The short answer for increasing your bench is to lift heavy. No more than 5 reps. for 5-7 sets, once a week (or every 5-7 days). If you want to increase your max, utilize a spotter. Forced reps are where you will begin to increase your one-time lift.<br>  <br>  Other important tips:<br>  Use perfect form. Bad form will limit your gains. You may drop at first if you aren’t using good form now, but you will make up for it soon.<br>  Do push-ups every night, but not many (20-50), this will keep your chest and shoulders loose and help “shock” the muscles that will be getting used to heavy/low rep lifts.<br>  Eat lots of protein, a drink would be good as you are trying to loose fat and most food that is very high in protein is also high in fat.<br>  Be careful with your cardio. Loosing too much fat too quickly will likely result in a loss of power. Cardio 3 times a week is ideal (heart rate in the 180 bpm range for 20-40 min.).<br>  Don’t ignore the core lifts. Squat and dead lift for example and strong abs will also help increase your bench press.<br>  <br>  I have been a recreational power lifter for over 20 years and have learned a lot by talking to people who knew more than I. Personal experience with what I have mentioned will have very favorable results. Good luck!|`|lxXSQ1Nmaa	What is yoga?<br>  Yoga is the best and most time-tested path to physical and mental well-being known to mankind. While some people think of yoga simply as physical exercise, it is actually a complete system for overall health and well-being. It includes everything from physical postures, personal hygiene, and a healthy diet to premeditation, breathing, and relaxation techniques. The most advanced forms of meditation and self-realization are also a part of yoga. Wai Lana’s workouts focus on yoga’s physical techniques. <br>  Why do yoga?<br>  Like many forms of exercise, yoga asanas effectively stretch and strengthen your body. The greatest benefits of yoga asanas, however, come from their profound effects on the internal systems of the body. By bending, stretching, twisting, and flexing in the various postures, you bathe your internal organs with oxygenated blood and prana, also known as life force energy or chi. Yoga asanas soothe and tone your nerves and regulate the endocrine system, which is responsible for the production of hormones—one of the keys to both physical and mental health. They also improve digestion and elimination, strengthen the respiratory system, and tone the reproductive organs. Although yoga techniques like asanas, breathing, and relaxation are extremely effective in relieving stress, it is Yoga Sound meditation that relieves deep-seated stress and anxiety, enabling you to experience yoga's greatest gifts: spiritual happiness and inner peace. <br>  <br>  Wai Lana<br>  It would be difficult, if not impossible, to find anyone who has had as much influence as Wai Lana in increasing the worldwide appreciation of the beauty and benefits of the ancient art of yoga. Wai Lana's internationally aired TV series attracts a huge audience and has played a significant part in the skyrocketing popularity of yoga. Click here to read Wai Lana’s biography.<br>  <br>  What is Pilates?<br>  Derived from ancient yoga asanas, the Pilates exercise system was formulated by Joseph Pilates over 80 years ago for more specific and limited purposes. Although Pilates is not a complete balanced or holistic exercise and health system, it is quite useful. Pilates focuses mainly on cultivating core strength in the body and lengthening the spine. Practiced for decades by dancers, Pilates has become popular in recent years for its largely aesthetic body sculpting effect. Pilates can be a valuable tool for enhancing strength, definition, and good posture in partnership with Wai Lana Yoga. Click here to explore Wai Lana's Pilates Yoga line of products<br>  <br>  Guidelines for yoga and Pilates practice:<br>  ? Yoga postures, especially inversions and those that compress the abdomen, should not be done on a full stomach. Listen to your body—if you practice too soon after eating or drinking, certain poses will feel uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  ? It’s best to practice yoga asanas barefoot, using a yoga mat or nonslip surface for standing poses. A mat, rug, or folded yoga blanket will provide firm padding for other asanas.<br>  <br>  ? Wear comfortable clothing, something that allows you to move freely.<br>  <br>  ? Ideally, the room should be well ventilated. Have enough space to extend your arms and legs in all directions without hitting anything.<br>  <br>  ? While practicing, concentrate on the feeling that the asana is producing in your body.<br>  <br>  ? If you feel too weak or shaky in a pose, come out of it. Gradually, you will build up your strength and be able to hold the pose longer.<br>  <br>  ? Don't go beyond your personal limitations, but extend your boundaries gently. Doing the asanas correctly means doing them to the best of your ability without straining.<br>  <br>  ? Throughout the workout, focus on your breath, inhaling and exhaling fully and completely through your nose. Breathing with awareness not only feels good, but also balances and regulates energy flow within the body, strengthening your internal organs and boosting your resistance to disease.

I didn't at age 12, and rarely do it now. It is a bother. I don't like it for various reasons. I also don't appreciate other people telling me how they think my body should look! I didn't shave at all throughout most of my being a teenager, except I would trim a little down there, and sometimes shaved for special occasions if I absolutely had to. Now I have a boyfriend I feel like I should do it sometimes but really I'm not fussed by my body hair and I don't care what anybody else thinks, it's my body. Sometimes I get strange glances if I walk around in shorts but usually not and when I wear trousers it's all the same. At school a few people tried to tease me but they soon gave up. They were trying to get me to shave at 11! I think that's stupid, kids shouldn't have to worry about making themselves more attractive to boys! Allrighty that's my rant. Do whatever you want. It's your body. You only have to conform to a point. You can shave less often, or wear pants more, or just wait for everyone to shut up. My hair is noticeable too, but once you get past a certain age, people won't mention it. <br>  <br>  And there are some other women out there who don't shave. Some of my friends who were blonde only started at about 16 or later, and only the bottoms of their legs, and I know a couple of friends at age 19/20 who still don't do it (but they're Asian and don't have much hair). I also know plenty of girls who give it a miss during winter or once they're married...guys are all different and some are superficial but some don't care much past a certain point.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Have kept it all off for 8 years.  I bike outside 10 miles every day and also do the treadmill 5 miles a day..averages out to be one hour on the bike and 75 minutes on the treadmill.  I attended only three meetings - reason is that I did not want to sit and listen to excuses why people gained weight - I was fat, determined to lose and did - 5'7 and 120 pounds...  There are a lot of tips on losing weight but I recommend a program.  If WW does not work for you, try another one but you've got to hit rock bottom before losing weight will work for you.  Good luck - if I can do it  you can also!
NRuAH3Rhaa	All of them. A multivitamin should be based on food-sources and should provide complete nutritional support.<br>  <br>  In additional to a multivitamin, an Omega 3 Fatty Acid supplement also promotes neurological development.<br>  <br>  The need for dietary supplements is considered so obvious that even the AMA, through an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, stated that all people should take a basic dietary supplement to ensure adequate nutritional support. They said this based on USDA data showing, very clearly, that the food supply itself is less nutritious than the same foods grown only 20 years ago. Also, the USDA released an economic report proving that less than 1% of Americans come even close to eating the minimal amount of fruits and vegetables necessary for basic nutrition. They went on to say that an additional 16 million acres of farm land are necessary to produce that much food as most of our farm land is dedicated to corn and soy.<br>  <br>  However, quality is everything when it comes to dietary supplements and most dietary supplements are very low quality and are literally made from petroleum derived chemicals.<br>  <br>  Of course, dietary supplements are intended to supplement, not substitute, the benefits of a good diet.|`|cf8091a2e8b86ab178eaf1d7d077c3d2aa	Actually, a vitamin supplement is not needed in a healthy child that is receiving proper nutrition.

0L5wCemvaa	Any diet drink will help you lose weight if you use it instead of full sugar drinks.  But lipton green tea does contain a type of flavonoid antioxidants called catechins.  (Surpisingly the level of antioxidants in a bottle of lipton green iced tea is the same as in an average cup of hot green tea that you brew yourself from a teabag.)  There are many health benefits associated with green tea catechins but you may be particularly interested in recent research that suggests green tea catechins may increase fat-burning metabolism.  It seems to be particularly effective with visceral fat (ie fat around the abdomen and waist).  In fact I believe Lipton has just launched a product in Europe with double the level of catechins that is marketed as a slimming tea.|`|e0af25a7a52f26cb654683cd39018a7faa	no, it's all a con... just enjoy!
ff03cd5287f1d62367e5f228fb2ec763aa	Either see the doc, or put up with the pain, and cut the nail by nibling at it with clippers.  You will need to cut that corner off to dislodge it from under your skin.  It will help to pull the skin away from the side of the nail as you do it.  Use the nail prong to try to pry the nail out from under the skin, by moving it from the exposed area to the edge of the nail, and under the skin.  Use a flame to heat the prongs first to get them a little sterile.  <br>  The nail will be like this for a long time, and you will need to gradually flatten it out, by keeping it cut short as much as possible and not wearing tight shoes over that toe.|`|9syZOhTgaa	That's an ingrown toenail.<br>  <br>  You should see a doctor!

q74X67TEaa	I once read this book by Lois Duncan, I believed it was called, "Stranger With My Face." They talked about this thing called astral projection, where its like you have an out of body experience. I didn;'t understand it to well, but supposedly you have a "cord" attached to you, and you can travel to places.<br>  <br>  This site explains well: <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/astral.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crystalinks.com/astral.html</a><br>  <br>  <br>  In astral projection the conscious mind leaves the physical body and moves into the astral body. The astral body is one of our subtle bodies.<br>  <br>  Some people can astral project naturally. Others are afraid to leave the physical body and never are able to astral project. An alternative approach is remote viewing.<br>  <br>  In astral projection you remain attached to your physical body by a silver "umbilical type" cord. Some people see the cord and others do not.<br>  <br>  You are aware of things you encounter along the way while out of your body.<br>  <br>  To astral project, as with all out-of-body experiences - one must feel totally relaxed, clothing fitting comfortable, reclining is best. Often a comforter is best over the body as the physical body sometimes gets cold when you travel out.|`|ff03cd5287f1d62367e5f228fb2ec763aa	There is this machine.

Even if they were, it's really easy for your "out of body" experience to become a "death".|`|EUzomOdKaa	You have to have gone through extremes to go through out of body experiences.<br>  EG. Being very ill<br>  <br>  An out-of-body experience (OBE) is characterized by a feeling of departing from one’s physical body and observing both one’s self and the world from outside one’s body. The experience is quite common in dreams, daydreams, and memories, where we quite often take the external perspective. Some OBEs coincide with lucid dreaming. Some people experience an OBE while under the influence of an anesthetic or while semi-conscious due to trauma. Some people have an OBE while under the influence of drugs. OBEs have been induced by  electrically stimulating the right angular gyrus (located at the juncture of the temporal and parietal lobes).  Finally, some people experience an OBE when they are near death (near-death experiences or NDEs). <br>  Read Robert monroe's book called   'Journeys out of the Body'|`|W0NqJp7Zaa	Be careful with this curiosity. While you are away from your body, what is to keep another from occupying it?<br>  <br>  If you would like to have a spiritual experience without the worry of losing control, ask one of the 5 million believers of "Baptism of the Holy Spirit"<br>  <br>  You can read about it in The Bible. The Books of Acts, chapter 2 has the definitive answer. It speaks about when this power was unleashed and the way to experience it.<br>  <br>  I experienced it when I was 17 years old. I will never forget it or deny it. I felt like I was standing/ dancing in the prescence of God Almighty and it was a place of perfect warmth and love. It was another place altogether but I stayed in my body.<br>  <br>  The beauty is this. I can find that place without a trance. It stays with you. There are 5 million people around the globe who visit this place and never leave the earth as it is a place within.<br>  <br>  Check out the Book of Acts, Chapter 2 in The Bible if you want a real, safe, satisfying and staying experience. That is not the only place it is recorded but the first. It has been happening ever since. There was a new outbreak around the turn of the century in California. It has been growing and gaining momentum like never before.<br>  <br>  It may sound whacky but the people who first experienced this were called drunks. I don't consider myself whacky and not a drunk . I am a business proffesional and I do ok. <br>  <br>  Please be careful about any other means of reaching an out of body experience.

rpGbDVbdaa	It could be a number of things there are clinics that go by your income. It could be you over exerted yourself in your workout. A cool down afterwards brings your heartrate down slowly. also, it could be your blood pressure is too high could cause a heartattack or stroke. what worries me is the blind and vomiting that is not normal. It could be your heart. Don't freak out just try to find a low income clinic call united way at 211 on your home phone they might beable to direct you to someone in your area or go to an emergency room. they cannot turn you down. They will bill you but, remember no hospital bill can ever go on your credit history so just go and take care of your health.|`|AA10107953	You need a thorough check up from a different doctor.

da6c9efbd4e8009c0e5c49eb5607fe6faa	If you'd like them to be regular- back onto birth control.<br>  <br>  Some women simply don't have regular cycles. It's a frustrating event.<br>  <br>  In saying that perhaps a change in your diet and physical activity may help. Women who over exercise or underexercise can inadvertantly alter thier hormone levels and thus effect thier periods.<br>  <br>  Alternatively excessive body weight or a lack of body weight can also reek havoc!<br>  <br>  Last but not least some people beleive that a diet high in chemicals and saturated fat an lead to an imbalance in hormones.<br>  <br>  I'd be first looking at your general health- if no major changes need to be undertaken perhaps talk to a registered naturopath or homepath.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
da6c9efbd4e8009c0e5c49eb5607fe6faa	An uncirumsized penis still has the foreskin attached to it.<br>  <br>  Most men are born with a flap of skin around the tip of thier penis. This is called the foreskin. It starts where the nobbley bit is, and looks like a less taught peice of skin than the head, but much the same is shape (not normally pink either).<br>  <br>  During sex the foreskin pulls back to reveal the tip of the penis.<br>  <br>  In a circumsised man the foreskin has been removed (normally at a very yound age) so that the tip of the penis is always exposed.<br>  <br>  Thier are people that believe that it is healthier to remove it (It can be subject to infection if proper hygeine is not maintained), other think that it's healthier to leave it there (as it protects the head of the penis).<br>  <br>  Ultimately it's personal choice and studies have indicated that there is no difference to a mans verility or enjoyment of sex with or without the procedure.
CFCmsvHGaa	i ussually wash right away, other wise you feel weird with that **** on your hands...ya no?|`|ynj5po8maa	Yes, the sperm on you hands will dry on the item and you will touch dry sperm. So wash immedately or wear a condom.
yzbG8823aa	you're doing it wrong simply because you have a spotter. Pick a weight that you can do without a spotter at a rep of 8-15 per set for muscle size. 6-8 for strength. You are doing too many sets. Watch in 4 weeks, you'll end up hitting a plateau and itll be even harder to get over that. Lose the spotter, drop the weight, drop the number of sets to a max of 5. if it was me, i'd start at 3 sets first week, then 4 the next, then 5, the lower the sets to 3 sets per week for the next 3 weeks to avoid a platuea and repeat<br>  ---<br>  ideally. i wouldn't work out like this. just something similar to this.
c778305da00a53fc785eff6eb33cddecaa	A full push-up is from the "up position" (arms in full extension-elbows straight), keeping the back straight, lowering your body down then back up. <br>  Count full push-ups for 1 full minute|`|yzbG8823aa	you build size when you do reps in the range of 8-15 per set. you can do as many sets as you want or until you're maxed out but if you do that, give your chest a full week to heal or you'll be overtraining. i'd say do 8-15. rest one minute. repeat. just make sure you are doing it properly because most people just do it as fast as they can. the slower you do it, the faster youll build muscles. but personally i think you should also do incline and decline push ups along with regular push ups. or else when you do build mass, since you only working the middle of the chest, your chest will look weird. thats just my opinion though.|`|OeWILgqwaa	Diamond pushups work your pecs really well, at least for me. Everyone says keeping your arms far apart is the best, but putting my hands close together with the thumb and index finger touching does it for me.
4CQf9G4kaa	I would not use a corset to reduce the effect of bloating - that wont work. What a corset will do is reduce the size and shap of your waist a bit, if it is worn consistently everyday or every other day. This is due to the fact that women's fat, unlike mens, is fluid like. Therefore it will disperse around the body - don't worry - you wont end up with one big fat foot or something! lol but it will shape your waist into a beautiful hourglass figure.|`|yzbG8823aa	using a corset is fine but you should never tighten it so much that it is uncomfortable or else you run the risk of crushing your internal organs and rib cage in the long run. Either use a corset on a comfortable setting or you can buy a pantyhoses that goes to the waist. Itll reduce your waist size by 1. for your bloated stomach you should really get medicine or eat yogurt and excercise.<br>  <br>  -im a boy so i shouldnt know this..|`|3gDK7FHUaa	Wearing a corset would only be a temporary fix it could make you stomach worse if worn too tightly. <br>  <br>  You should treat the actually problem try taking supplements that help your digestive tract, drink plenty of water throughout the day to help flush toxins.<br>  <br>  It may take a while for the bloat to go away but you will at least have the problem fixed on a more permanent basis.|`|TjHI1uyqaa	The cells in your body have a type of "memory" for holding shape.  A waist cincher, when worn during the day everyday for a period of time (maybe 3 months to a year depending on your body)  can retrain the cells in your waist to create a flatter shape.  I this only works with water retention and bloating, not body fat.  But you will still need to treat the underlying issues of the bloating or the shape will come back.  Wear your waist slimmer while you treat the problem and for a period of time after the problem is solved.  I wouldn't wear those deptment store type slimmers, they are more for giving a smoother shape under clothes then really re-shaping the waist.  Look online at supplies sold for post abdominal surgery patients and tummy tucks.  Those garments are sold to do the very thing you are wanting.
X1k6IElQaa	I lost mine too after I had my daughter. My doc said that it mostly has to do with the change in hormones after a woman's body has given birth. Add to that the exhaustion of chasing a toddler around and then all you want to even think about doing in bed is sleep! It is very common. Sometimes it comes back on its own, and sometimes it needs a little help. If you get really concerned about it definitely see your doctor, there are things they can prescribe for it. A second honeymoon always helps too! ; )|`|da6c9efbd4e8009c0e5c49eb5607fe6faa	Sometimes the saying 'fake it untill you make it' is good. I wouldn't be suggesting to fake an O or something, but fake the whole sexy thing...<br>  <br>  Get all dressed up and 'play' the sex kitten... sometimes it can help you find your mojo more than him! <br>  <br>  Also- use lube... not having the pressure of having to be really 'wet' can help you feel a little more into it, not to mention having him apply it...<br>  <br>  Otherwise watching porn together, or seeing a sex therapist might help... Just make sure hubby knows that you love him regardless of your sexual desires.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|WU8BZKEIaa	You could try a couple things to change your sex drive and make it strong.  Dieting and exercising are the main things you can do.  I've been there and tried that and it didn't work for me whatsoever.  I tried a natural supplement out called Hersolution that is meant for increasing the female libido.  It sure works great and continues doing so.  Read up about it at herenhancement.com where I saved money on it.  If your on BC or anything you might want to consider the gel if you don't like swallowing pills.  I've tried a tube of that and let me tell you what, incredible.  Nothing works better then hersolution, its like natural viagra for us!  Good luck and I hope this helps.

GKAZ8SKVaa	depends on the causes of your sleep apnea.  One of the main causes is being overweight, and you don't even have to be a lot overweight.  That's not always the cause (my dad has it, and has always been on the leaner side).  My older sister has it, and hers is DEFINITELY weight related.<br>  <br>  Not knowing you i can't say if weight is a factor or not, but you would know.  If it is, try eating healthy, (which everybody should do anyhow), and you will lose weight as a side effect of eating healthy.<br>  <br>  Sometimes sleeping on the side helps, but not always.<br>  <br>  There are alternatives, i.e. surgery, but as for how well that works, not sure (according to a doc i saw recently, he says it's 50/50, but anther doc said he gets good results).  Surgery should ALWAYS be a last result however, but sleep apnea needs to be taken care of.  It's very hard on the heart.|`|T3posUpZaa	I have apnea too and no money to be treated.

I felt as though there was something wrong with me!<br>  <br>  I didn't have any issues with foods or cramps etc, but everyone is different. Perhaps the lower appetite is a good thing?

CdkSndL8aa	cut down on carbs.|`|lWi989Tqaa	Losing weight is a simple equation: if you burn more calories than you eat, the weight will come off. Start off by estimating how many calories you burn each day using the daily calorie needs calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a>  This will give you an idea of how many calories to eat. Healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week you need to create a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat) of 500 calories per day. To lose 2 pounds a week, you have to double the deficit to 1000 calories per day. You can achieve this by eating less, exercising more or a combination of both.<br>  <br>  Beginner's Guide to Dieting  - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>|`|N0Tk90Btaa	Burn more calories than you're taking in.

08181f5f2dbe671cdb63e0ab5fe09282aa	i have just answered a similar one to this so i will give you the same answer as i gave the other person.<br>   Yes i have been there before and even made such attempts. The effect afterwards was emotionally shocking. I felt low and i had these feelings for years. Dont make attempts on your life, make attempts on fullfilling your goals, set goals, get lots of outdoor exercise, join a gym and watch something that you find amusing on tv. I would like you try something it will take you about an hour if done properly. Sit and think about all the things that would make you happy in life, career,family,love life ect ect ect. Think about everything that you would like to achieve. Once you have that in your head open a word pad on your pc and spend the rest of that hour typing it down slowley and thinking about each one being achieved while you do it. You will come to the realization that life can turn on a dime and great things can be achieved.|`|rcKMtglSaa	Happens to all of us from time to time.<br>  <br>  Actually, this adversity if a good thing at times because you are only going to end up getting through it and building your character.<br>  <br>  Hang in.|`|OcTCrOlKaa	Yes I feel the same way right now!

bw52ruhxaa	you need to go to your local mental health center and talk to a counselor. he/she will prescribe you meds for your depression. in the meantime, talk to your mother about this. you might be surprised. give her a chance to hear you. call up a friend. go out with a friend. read a good book or watch a funny movie. distract yourself. get into a bathtub of bubbles. talk to someone you can trust. with your history of depression--you should be on meds. good luck|`|ki4eRaVeaa	It seams to me you may have a lot of anxiety, which could have led to your depression.  Try contacting the Midwest Center for anxiety and depression.  They offer a self help program which will help you understand your depression and how to correct it.  They cover things such as diet, exercise, relaxation methods, and positive thinking.  It's not a quick fix but it worked for me.|`|H1kUZd9Iaa	I was in a similar situation.  It is good that you went back with your mother . . . good to be surrounded by love in a bad time.  If you still feel bad, you need to occupy your time with something -- a new job, or go volunteer.  If still bad, just look up a therapist and doctor to get help, and ask your mother if she can help.|`|xlQnAHh5aa	I believe that your condition, and I say condition because depression is an illness, and not a personal failure, needs the guidance of someone who specializes in its treatment.

zWwmRydqaa	When you get home start hitting "career builders" "hot jobs" "monster jobs" etc, while you still have the job, look for what you want-while you are there-then apply to all those you are qualified for and, when they reach out to you, maybe they need you to interview-make an appointment (you may have to take a personal day), interview-and if accepted-Give your appropriate notice-and get the heck out of dodge! In the mean time save your money-save your money-save your money- as you may have to wait on your first paycheck from the new place- and be nice with the current employer-#1 because you will always have a good reference-Blessings and good luck!|`|08181f5f2dbe671cdb63e0ab5fe09282aa	Wow your circumstances are incredibly identical to my own. First thing, make the most of your days off, go out and hit the town and have a few light drinks with some friends. When you leave work, leave work at work. Dont think about it once your shift has finished, just go home and dont think about the next day. An important one here, is make friends where you work, that will help you tolerate the job a little bit better. But i have to say if where you work is really having this kind of effect on you, then you should consider finding other work.|`|dc8b99bbf8a2eef867eb7325c56b3e9eaa	It might help to know what the job is and why you hate it so much.  How old are you?  Is this just temporary?  I would try to meet some people at this job.  Also, make plans for your days off so that you have something to look forward to.  I agree that you probably shouldn't quit right away.  It doesn't look good when you go to apply for a new job. Hang in there!

We have things in life that are important to us and as we are all different in views of priorities. Whatever it is thats bothering you, if its something you cant change then try to focus on something else because if you cant change it whats the point of worrying. Remember if we thought about and worried about everything in our lives we wouldnt have time for anything else.|`|SeTsXNdLaa	I think everyone does; the trick is to find that one activity, or even "mental picture"- for me it's the waves crashing against the rocks and finally lapping their way up the beach of the pacific ocean as the sun slowly sinks into the water for the night, the air gets cooler, and the stars come out- that allows you to take a break from it all; take care of your issues as much as you can, and then forgive yourself for not being able to finish everything, or for not being erfect, or watever the case might be... and RELAX! :)<br>  <br>  Good luck, and best wishes!|`|bpSpYtCjaa	it will be good, you can ...<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.in-brands.com/showsort.asp?sort_id=124" rel="nofollow">http://www.in-brands.com/showsort.asp?so...</a>

Everybody makes mistakes. If you make a mistake learn to laugh at yourself. Also, truly accepting yourself means that you learn from your mistakes rather than beating yourself up for them. <br>  <br>  To truly accept yourself you must learn to free yourself from negative thinking. Focus on your accomplishments. Instead of saying, "I'm not very popular, say. "I may not be the most popular person but I'm popular with the people that matter the most."<br>  <br>  You can always be more accepting of yourself if you know that you gave something your best effort. Like well, "I didn't get an A on that chemistry test but I studied hard and got a B so I should be proud." You are less likely to be disappointed in yourself if you set realistic goals.<br>  <br>  People that don't accept themselves tend to fear rejection from others. Stop worrying about what other people think. If a person of the opposite sex turns you down say," Well that's a relief! Now I know that they're not available and I can ask somebody else. I'm sure that somebody else will appreciate me more anyway."<br>  <br>  Try a self-exercise where you write down things about yourself that you like. Also try repeating mantras like, "I'm a person that is worthy of other people's respect." If this becomes part of your routine you will eventually start to believe in yourself more. Good luck!<br>  <br>  For more tips consider seeing a counselor.|`|8zTZ21I0aa	<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Be-Happy-Being-Yourself" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Be-Happy-Being-Yo...</a><br>  I'm sure u can read this thoroughly when u have the time. & u can go to that website instead of yahoo answers if u want.
08181f5f2dbe671cdb63e0ab5fe09282aa	I Had a terrible terrible fear of spiders, i couldnt sleep in  the same room if i knew one was in there. The way i beat it, is to research about them, learn about them and about the different species, you would find life on earth impossible without spiders. As you spend time learning about them you will begin to realize your fear is irrational and you will become more at ease with them. Whilst learning about an amazing creature, Humans beings despite all there brilliance in inventions and intellegance still cant create the spiders material that is the web. It cannot be machine made.|`|yQRfEiqoaa	Well I am not so sure as to how to quit being afraid of spiders, but use bug spray.  And what I do is put drier sheets all around my tent.  The spiders don't like the smell or something and they won't come near.  I also cover my bod in those bug spray wipes, look for the highest amount of deet that you can find.  People think those are only for mosquitos but they really keep the spiders away too.  Hope this helps.  I am absolutely terrified of all spiders so these are what I do.|`|AA11612666	Yes, I know. The black windows are really scary..you can't see out of them even in broad daylight.|`|oRfUxzROaa	Get one as a pet! Feed it with other bugs that scare you, it will become your friend! (I'm on medication right now so I might answer stupid stuff)|`|IMu3wBu8aa	i can see why you would be scared camping. im sure everyone thinks about bugs when they go. but in general to get over the fear. try not to let them scare you. look at them differently. even read about them. there's a lot of harmless spiders that come and go in the houses and all. there are also bad ones. but once you know the difference and you don't let them get to you. you should be ok. IM TERRIFIED MYSELF. but one day i was like im such a chicken (im scared of everything lol) so when i saw one i just stared at it. i still got chills and stuff but i was realizing i don't have to be terrified. i had bad experiences with them but i try and avoid them.

I recommend trojan ultra thin for more sensation. However, since you are a virgin I would get trojan her pleasure b/c you want to last as long as possible. If you last at least 10 minutes she will probably be impressed. You also might want to get extra lube to put on the condom(I'd recommend KY). If you last awhile the condom will start to dry out and it will be less comfortable for her. Good luck!
KtdlJbrOaa	inflammation of the colon, or large intestine. The term “colitis” may be used to refer to any of a number of disorders involving the colon. Symptoms include diarrhea (often with blood and mucus), abdominal pain, and fever.<br>  Ulcerative colitis is a serious chronic inflammation and ulceration of the lining of the colon and rectum. Another form of colitis, called Crohn's disease, has similar signs and includes thickening of the intestinal wall. The disease typically occurs in the small intestine near the point where it joins the colon, but the colon and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract may be affected as well. The term “inflammatory bowel disease” has been used to refer to both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the causes of which are unknown. A less severe disorder, known as irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, was formerly called mucous colitis.<br>  <br>  Colitis is sometimes caused by infections with viruses, parasites, or bacteria. For example, two distinct types of dysentery are caused by amebas and bacteria. Infectious forms of colitis are often the result of poor hygienic practices. Prolonged use of antibiotics can also cause colitis, either by direct irritation of the colon or by killing bacteria that normally live in the intestine, allowing the toxin-producing bacterium Clostridium difficile to proliferate. Colitis is also sometimes caused by diverticulitis (see under diverticulosis) or by colon cancer.<br>  <br>  Treatment of colitis may include the administration of antibiotics and general anti-inflammatory medications such as Mesalamine or its derivatives, steroids, or one of a number of other drugs that ameliorate inflammation. Surgery is sometimes needed, especially in cases of fulminant colitis. Surgery usually entails removing the colon and bowel and creating a "pouch" with portions of the small intestine.<br>  <br>  Changes in diet can be effective at treating the symptoms of colitis and easing the side effects. These can include reducing the intake of carbohydrates, lactose products, soft drinks and caffeine.<br>  <br>  |`|jFSTdVLmaa	it's inflammation of the colon ..<br>  <br>  the treatment depends on the cause.. it could be treated with diet modification, antibiotics, anti inflammatory drugs, or surgery..<br>  <br>  again, getting rid of it depends on the cause.

If you are stuck at a certain weight, all I can suggest is limiting your calorie intake and excercise more than you are now.  Keep in mind that if you are doing a lot of exercising, you may be losing fat and gaining muscle.  Since muscle weighs more than fat, you could be gaining weight because of that.

98ea2c3cae837e7234ae08341a7ed053aa	THE WHOLE FINGER DOWN YOUR THROAT, TRY THIS AFTER EVERY MEAL FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS.  WORKS GREAT!!|`|445d9cf22ea5373585d7b9e58fd8345daa	In the 60s and 70s some models got surgery to remove their lowest ribs to get a smaller waist.  Like others here have written, starving yourself or purging your food, i.e., developing an eating disorder, are other, DANGEROUS, options.  In my personal experience, abs and exercises to the area won't do much for your waist unless you have fat on it to get rid of.  In that case, increase your cardovascular exercise.  No need to go "faster", just longer at a moderate speed/rate in whatever exercise you like sweating in.  There are muscles in that area, the most prominent ones being "love handles" and mid and lower abdominals.  You can add crunches to your routine immediately as well as ab crunches using weights.  The trick is to crunch daily, add it to your morning routine.  After you wake up, roll to the floor and stretch.  Then do 5 sets of 20-25 repetitions of crunches.  Each week add 10 repetitions to the count until you reach 100 repetitions.  Trust me, if you concentrate, you can do it.  Just focus on the crunch and the counting.  Your reward will be a nice hot shower and breakfast.  Make sure you don't bend your neck.  You should be able to raise your upper body 45 degrees holding your neck in place and keeping your legs bent at the knees in front of you.  <br>  <br>  Track your progress.  Measure your waist using measuring tape before you start working on it, then measure it again 6 weeks later.  <br>  <br>  Don't obsess is the most important thing to remember.  Also, a women's figure needs to be balanced:  36-26-36 more than 10 inches in betwen breasts and hips is getting unproprotioned. <br>  <br>  If you ever read Playboy, you'll notice chicks have tiny waists of 23 or 24 with HUGE boobs.  Think about your breast size when deciding to change your waist size.  Not all of us live in La-la-land (i.e., Los Angeles).<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|db8c6271af0c67a5f4165152a989fed2aa	well, you can only go so small as your bones will allow|`|2c52059b7c25f74cf297795f6626f908aa	ab workouts will tone your waist making it appear smaller. Try reg. crunches, then ones where you hold it for 2 sec then ankle touches.|`|a667e8ff2f4f12bd4091c79f1869721aaa	First off, don't do crunches.  They do nothing to shrink the stomach.  If you have even a little bit of flab there (and I know thin girls who do), even 1000 crunches won't help.  The only way to lose ab fat is to eat less, drink more water, and take brisk walks.

If leading on a rope, make some kissy noises and begin jogging and pulling steady (if the horse is real lazy you will have to work extra, but they will trot). If riding, again make kissy noise, and tap with both feet lightly until he begins to trot, then keep leg tight to the sides with firm pressure, tapping again lightly to speed up he trot, or to keep him trotting if he tries to walk. Lunging a horse, you could use the end of the lunge line, or a whip and hit the ground behind the horse. Start gently and get stronger if needed, if using the end of the line, twirl in a circle, hit it on the ground, twirl occasionally to keep him at a trot.|`|AA12052123	Maybe womens health is not the BEST place for this question??|`|AA10987972	yes contact a trainer near you and they will train it or tell you how

I highly doubt it'd be a ovarian cyst bursting unless you do have an ovarian cyst, Have you been checked for an STI? if not then I would surely go and get tested. If you have clamydia or somthing of that such there could be no symptoms until it makes its presence known, I would go get checked just in case chicka. Since you're on your period I would assume that it would be cramps, however I am not lol and I dunno damn our womanhood lol, jk, If this pain reoccurs with a fever or vomting go to the ER cause it may be your appendix, even thought your appendix is on the right lower side the pain can go around your tummy. I'm sure you're fine. 
G4UP1OCJaa	Sperm's ingredients list looks like a label attached to a vitamins' box. It is very strange, but amazingly true. Sperm consists of at least 2 vitamins: C and B12. It also contains important minerals, including such elements like calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, and phosphor. 2 sweet substances are included in sperm's composition. They are the fructose and the sorbitol. Besides the other obvious ingredients the sperm has, it contains also proteins. They make the sperm to be an exceptional nutritional supplement but will never substitute a balanced diet. It is worthy to mention about the existence of a significant amount of cholesterol and sodium in sperm. <br>  <br>  |`|naJCQMlQaa	vitamins,sperm(babys),hormones, and alot of other things. im not exactly sure but i think thats right. all you need to know is that it shouldnt go into a girl unless your ready for the consequences and that its white(lol wtf?)|`|FMmm8LiYaa	Mostly fructose, proteins, and other minerals that help the sperm stay alive.|`|ynj5po8maa	Sperm|`|rRVtq8TKaa	sperm<br>  and cookies|`|IVy35SE2aa	sperm and precum.|`|hG8tLBSMaa	SPERM!!!!!!

Metabolism is measured through an equation called basal energy expenditure (BEE). BEE is a measure of how many calories you body burns when you are at rest. Infants/children/adolescents need more calories relative to their weight than adults b/c they are growing. A pregnant or lactating woman needs extra calories to support the needs of their baby. A sedentary adult needs about 10 calories per lb for weight maintenance.

Drink 100 oz. of water a day, also have a cocktail made with 8 oz. water, 3 tbsp vinegar and  tbsp. honey to speed metabolism. Chew sugar free gum frequently, this burns calories.  I lost about 30 pounds in a month and a half this way.|`|af6dc4240158c1a4fe4b979c4609e657aa	30 pounds is a lot to start with on your mind.  I would start with a cleanse (which is good for you anyway) that will make you lose a few or if you get a good one like Isotonics maybe about 10 pounds from the get go.  This will get your spirits up, will help you control portions and give you energy to lose the rest of the weight. <br>  <br>  Basic rules that helped me lose 20 pounds:<br>  <br>  1. you can have a "treat" if you wish but it has to be classified by where it is bought as a "low fat" item.  If you go into say a coffee shop and want a muffin, you can have a low fat option and if they don't have a low fat option, you can't have anything. (Same thing for salad dressing)<br>  2. Never have mayonaise, butter or cream no matter what.  If you are ordering a sandwich get a ruben (which has no mayonaise) or ask for cranberry sauce instead (it's really good on sandwiches too).<br>  3. Avoid breads altogether that are made with yeast.  Rye and pumpernickel are okay.  I'm not talking starches like rice, just plain old loaf.<br>  4. Milk for some reason makes me gain weight like crazy; I don't know about you but skim milk only was one of my rules that worked.  I was not allowed to have any milk unless it was skim that includes the milk in my coffee.<br>  <br>  Try it.  It's not too hard; just common sense really.  Some girls at work tried this and it worked for them losing weight too.

I worked up to a 150 lb two arm curl a while back when I weighed 170 lbs. The friend who's 225 only recently worked up to that amount so it's all about training, not much about weight until you get to heavier lifts.|`|7407d82947c8e9f4f505dced64443a20aa	I'm around 180 lbs and I can bench 250 lbs, no lie, it took many many consistent bench routines to get there though.  If you use proper technique, have a spotter, and try to increase your bench 5 to 10 lbs every other bench workout, you'd be amazed at how much you can gain.  <br>  <br>  I honestly think too many people don't try to bench enough, thats what a spotter is for.  I gained the most adding on much more than I mentally thought I could do and only doing like 2 reps of it, barely getting the 2nd one up.  Mentally you'll tell yourself, wow, I got the first one up no problem, I should aim higher and so forth.<br>  <br>  Once you work your pecs and get your chest area to built condition, you can easily get up to 250 lbs + for your size.  Just takes proper technique, consistently, and the mental focus to continue to add on more weight each time.

zMD0VeOmaa	According to the Center for Disease Control(CDC) you are at a healthy weight. Body mass index(BMI) measures your weight relative to your height to determine if you are healthy or not. BMI=kg/(m^2). You weigh 90lb/2.2= 40.9kg. You are 62in tall x 2.54=158.75cm or 1.5875m.<br>  So 40.9/(1.5875^2)=16.22.<br>  <br>  Your BMI is 16.22, which is between the 5th and 10th percentile for your age. A healthy weight for adolescents is above the 5th percentile. You would be too thin at 80-85lb. For adults, a BMI less than 18 is underweight. However, since you are still growing you have to compare yourself to your peers. It is normal to have lower amounts of body fat at 14 than when you have fully matured. Typically women add more body fat as their bodies mature.<br>  <br>  I do not know enough about you to make a diagnosis of anorexia. If you do suspect that you have an eating disorder you should consult a mental health professional who may refer you to a registered dietitian for further treatment.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like your family might be lowering your body image by telling you that you are too skinny. Tell them this upsets you.<br>  <br>  As a future dietitian, I certainly can't recommend that you skip meals. If you actually are skipping lunch you should stop. Your brain needs blood glucose to function normally. If you skip meals your body will convert your fat stores into ketones and use them for energy. This is your body telling you that it's starving and it will affect your moods. <br>  <br>  Not to mention if you are still growing, skipping meals could stunt your growth and cause amennorhea(absence of a period).<br>  <br>  Good luck. I hope this helps.<br>   |`|rDQeI5vSaa	i am anorexic, and i think thats to thin. dont become anorexic really it sucks and you end of acually gaining more weight then you lost because the doctors make you, please spare yourself if you try and loose weight you will have A LONG road ahead of you. best of luck!|`|10tQzTmmaa	Eat something, please. <br>  Your supposed to be around the 110 range at your age and height.<br>  I'm 14, 5'3 1/2 and weigh 115... and I'm not fat, just really really athletic.<br>  If your not athletic, then atleast get up to the 100 range... please, don't become sick.!|`|uKSsXz2iaa	Eat a sandwich.

zMD0VeOmaa	You may have a condition called orthostatic hypotension(low blood pressure when standing). Also, you might have low blood sugar. Does this occur when you haven't eaten for awhile?<br>  <br>  I would go to a doctor b/c you might be diabetic. He can do an oral glucose tolerance test. The results will enable the doctor to diagnose if you are diabetic. Doctors have to test you on two different occasions to make a definitive diagnosis.<br>  <br>  Another possiblility would be that you have something wrong with your inner ears. The inner ear is involved with balance. If the inner ears don't work properly you can have vertigo (dizziness).|`|azBErFyYaa	Please go see a doctor right away.

XnNhY38Taa	Negative emotions (like sadness, stress, anger, etc.) causes your Serotonin production to be low; when your Serotonin level is low, you are more prone to getting Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Depression, etc.<br>  <br>  Medication like Antidepressants (SSRI - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) helps to boost Serotonin level.<br>  But there are natural ways to do it without medication. There's this strange herb called "St John's Wort" - it is said to be more effective than Prozac. No, it is not for mild depression only and ignore those sayings. In fact, it does help anxiety and panic-attacks as St John's Wort works like prozac. Other natural ways will be exercise, diet, more exposure to light, etc.<br>  <br>  The problem is that, even if your Serotonin is balanced... you have that "learned behavior" in your mind. You need to break that initial cycle to destroy that learned behavior - Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) does this. A technique that you can use without CBT will be Distraction... There are several other techniques to help cope them!<br>  Ok, to use Distraction: Firstly, try to....<br>  <br>  Extracted from Source.|`|jHY8gYrLaa	Benedryl is an antihistamine - it helps with runny nose, itching and the like.

fkpyU4GBaa	If you don't feel any discomfort from wearing them, then there's probably nothing wrong with the lenses or your eyes.<br>  <br>  Your optician should advise you as to how long they can be worn.  If you only wear them for 2 hours then they should be good for another 5 hours if they are stored correctly.<br>  <br>  Multi purpose solutions are not necessary if you wear dailies for the maximum suggested time, they wont dry out just by walking to school, if they are kept in your eye, your tears keep the lenses soft enough for you to get them out.<br>  <br>  You could get some artificial tears to use if you feel that your eyes are too dry.

gkqmrIAGaa	Nana,  this fear is called emetophobia, that's emeoto-phobia.  Don't let anyone tell you that making yourself throw up will help it will make it worse.  Don't let any doctor give you medication for it as it doesn't help.  Maybe not now but when you are a little older you can see a therapist for help.  This is a problem that needs professional help.  Maybe talk to your mom about how serious it is to you and how it is affecting your life.  Also you may not believe it but it is very, very unlikely that you will get sick from eating in a restaurant.  This won't go away by itself unfortunately.

3156c54d8f966e51776af0486120bb1daa	Although some say that they don't do it, practically every boy masturbates at some time and most teens do it several times a week.  If every boy who masturbated was automatically debarred from joining a sports team then all organised sport would just stop.<br>  <br>  The doctor will probably assume that you masturbate, but he cannot tell unless you have semen stains on your briefs!  If the physical is purely to see if you are fit enough to play the sport then there is no reason why the doctor would have any interest in whether or not you masturbate.<br>  <br>  During a different sort of physical, at which your overall health and development is being assessed, the doctor may ask if you masturbate and if you ejaculate when you do so.  In such a case he is not judging you on a moral basis but simply using a normal action for a boy your age in order to establish if your sexual development is progressing normally.|`|ynj5po8maa	Totally not true, anybody can take a physical.|`|gy7kKfzOaa	Wow, who told you that?

Usually my g/f gets tired or sore before I finish but she loves our sex life.<br>  <br>  It takes me longer to have an orgasm as a side effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that I am taking. I usually have to finish myself manually to have an orgasm. When I do have an orgasm it is usually very intense since I hold it for so long.<br>  <br>  I'm satisfied with my sex life. While I wouldn't mind if it were quicker for me it does not bother me. My g/f can't orgasm through regular intercourse anyway unless I use a vibrating cock ring to stimulate her clit or if I rub her manually.

I would not advise anyone to attempt to deal with depression on their own.<br>  <br>  Having said that, once an expert has diagnosed the problem, some less severe cases of depression may respond better to a talking therapy than to medication. However the symptoms may change over time and if they get more severe medication may become necessary.<br>  <br>  There is no shame in taking medicine if you are ill.|`|CTUNqUUdaa	Negative emotions (like sadness, stress, anger, etc.) causes your Serotonin production to be low; when your Serotonin level is low, you are more prone to getting Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Depression, etc.<br>  <br>  Medication like Antidepressants (SSRI - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) helps to boost Serotonin level.<br>  But there are natural ways to do it without medication. There's this strange herb called "St John's Wort" - it is said to be more effective than Prozac. No, it is not for mild depression only and ignore those sayings. In fact, it does help anxiety and panic-attacks as St John's Wort works like prozac. Other natural ways will be exercise, diet, more exposure to light, etc.<br>  <br>  The problem is that, even if your Serotonin is balanced... you have that "learned behavior" in your mind. You need to break that initial cycle to destroy that learned behavior - Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) does this. A technique that you can use without CBT will be Distraction...

Sometimes depression is too severe and you can't take the steps needed to get out of it. I am not a psychiatrist but there are three things I would recommend, based on my own experience that can help one get out of depression.<br>  <br>  1. Socialize. When you are feeling depressed get out and chat with people. Do it in person, not email or texting, but actually spending time with someone at a coffee shop or over a beer if you're over 21. Get out and get talking. Don't talk about why you're depressed, talk about other things.<br>  <br>  2. Exercise always helps. If you can exercise outdoors, its better also. If you are not heavy into exercise just take a walk. If you have a dog, then walk the dog. <br>  <br>  3. Develop some hobbies you can obsess about. Hobbies can be a great way to get your mind off depression. I learned to ride horses, for example, and go horseback riding when I am feeling down. It refocuses my mind on something else and pulls me out of depression. So pick up a hobby, it could be anything: play basketball, soccer, ride horses, build model airplanes. Just something extra to get interested in.<br>  <br>  For anxiety, try reading this article for some tips:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://my-health-care-today.blogspot.com/2008/09/eliminate-anxiety-and-panic-attacks-for.html" rel="nofollow">http://my-health-care-today.blogspot.com...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  David|`|6MgcXM5aaa	Yes I have, by getting to know God through reading the bible.

I am going through the same thing right now.  You should definitely go to the doctor to get checked out and get a prescription.  There is a Vagisil screening kit which you could buy for about $15 and it will test the ph balance in your urine.  But, the safest thing would be to go to the doctor, if it is a yeast infection they will give you 2 Diflucan pills, one to take the day you get it and the next in 2 days to make sure the infection is gone.

dHTsBkc0aa	vicodin (hydrocodone) is a narcotic.  It is used for pain relief.  You should not take it if it is not prescribed to you.  It is an opiate and will make you feel high.  Opiates are extremely addictive, especially physically addictive.  STAY AWAY from it!!!|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Vicodin (Hydrocodone and paracetamol (acetaminophen)) is a selective pain killer.  In the United States, Vicodin production is regulated in part by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. This guarantees that all manufacturing, importing, possession, and distribution of drugs is to be overseen and regulated by the federal government, which is also responsible (along with the Department of Justice and state governments) for the conviction and sentencing of anyone who breaks drug laws. <br>  <br>  <br>  Scheduling<br>  Vicodin was put into Schedule III, along with anabolic steroids, ketamine, paregoric, Xyrem, dronabinol, and hydrocodone/codeine (when "compounded with an NSAID" or with paracetamol); these drugs have high psychological dependence and low to medium physical addiction, though less so than Schedule II such as oxycodone. [3]<br>  <br>  <br>  Indications<br>  Vicodin, like other opioid analgesics, is used to manage pain. It is most commonly prescribed for relief of mild to moderate pain of acute, chronic, or post-operative types.<br>  <br>  Side-effects<br>  Side-effects for Vicodin include an allergic reaction, weak breathing, seizures, clammy skin, severe weakness, dizziness, hyperventilation, unconsciousness, yellowing of eyes or skin, unusual fatigue, bleeding, bruising, constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, muscle twitches, sweating, itching, tinnitus, hearing loss, decreased urination, and decreased sex drive. [4] Vicodin (in terms of hydrocodone) also has depressant effects on the central nervous system. [5] However, some of the less mundane effects can be desirable effects that are sought after by some. Those effects include euphoria and drowsiness, as well as slowing of the pulse.[6] Vicodin has also been linked to causing stomach ulcers, although this is assumed to be due to the addition of other non-narcotic analgesics to hydrocodone preparations (e.g., APAP, aspirin, ibuprofen).<br>  <br>  <br>  Overdose symptoms<br>  Symptoms of a Vicodin overdose may include slow breathing, cold and clammy skin, dizziness, weakness, seizures, loss of consciousness, confusion, constricted pupils, tiredness, coma, nausea, vomiting, blueing of the tongue, and diaphoresis; an overdose may lead to death.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|RliSeL2Yaa	that is some good stuff. how many milligrams are in it?<br>  <br>  but yeah it will mess you up if you take like 30 or more milligrams, or it did for me. but watch out for the APAP dosage too cause that's really bad for you if you take it in high doses. <br>  and it doesnt reallly make you feel "high", it's more of a reaaaally relaxed state. like, everytime you move, you feeel more and more comfortable. i love it. 
KtdlJbrOaa	I read about it too & was shocked.  I have been inadvertantly following this diet for years & it has not worked!  Seriously, how can it possibly work with just a banana for breakfast, then anything you want for lunch and dinner.  The good part is no dessert & in bed before midnight.  THOSE are the things that will help you lose weight (but not a ton).|`|57fe50c4e85683b49af320d7c38e3172aa	I have tried almost all diets, including this one, and my experience is that there is no magic diet.  If you do not control the number of calories that you consume and then burn more through exercise, you will NOT lose weight.

Your doctor might think it's an infection, like a yeast infection.  But it might be a hygiene issue.<br>  <br>  Make sure every time you take a shower/bath, you pull back your foreskin and wash under it like you would any other part of your body.  Be sure to rinse the soap off completely when you're done, and you can dry the area with a clean towel before returning the foreskin back over the glans (penis head).<br>  <br>  If the soap you're using is a strong or scented soap, that could cause irritations under the foreskin and this could be the cause of your smell.  It's a good idea to either stop using soap on your penis for a week, to see if the smell goes away, or to use a mild and scentless soap on the area instead.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it could be an infection or something you ate.  Sometimes if we eat too much junk food we begin to smell.  Be sure to eat lots of healthy foods, and drink cranberry juice and eat yogurt in case it is an infection. Those will help your body clear the infection along with the cream that your doctor gave you (also, the cream itself might cause a smell, but if it hasn't been smelling worse since you got the cream, then that's probably not the issue).<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps.  Good luck with your issue.  Generally, it's not a very difficult problem to take care of.|`|hvKXPt3caa	If you cannot afford the surgery... there is always Drano !!!|`|ynj5po8maa	This happens to me too.

Okay its completely natural, don't worry. It happens to a lot of young men... a lot of times they happen randomly. Sometimes during class sometimes while your out and about. Its perfectly natural. If you can manage to somehow skip the shower and go straight home, I'm thinking its like an after school activity. Or you can wait it out in a bathroom stall and try to think of something so it'll go down. I'm sorry if I didn't offer much advise, but I'm a girl. lol. And I do know what I'm talking about.

If you want to make it look bigger- try shaving/trimming the hair around it. Most women get their pleasure from the kissing, touching, etc kind of things. If you're feeling like you're "not doing" it for her, try learning where her "G-spot" is(yes, it does exsist and is great to play with) or try clitoral stimulation(licking it) and give her time to relax and enjoy it and she will get off.

R9KvEhMxaa	The egg technique is an older one, though still commonly used for 'attenuated' vaccines like the flu.<br>  <br>  The viruses originally came from people, yes, though at this point, pretty much every virus has been grown and cultured - you can order a pure sample from many biolab suppliers.<br>  <br>  The more modern way to do it is to infect human cells with it. We now have lines of human cells that can live indefinitely in a petri dish. We infect the cells with the virus, and then harvest the virus as it sheds from them. You then sell the virus, or process it for the parts you need, or weaken it to make an old-style vaccine.<br>  <br>  Attenuated vaccines are becoming less and less common. Most new vaccines are recombinant proteins. Basically, we just grow the part of the virus that your immune system needs to recognize and attack.  Eventually, we'll have DNA vaccines, which have amazing potential. At that point we won't even really need the virus anymore, just its DNA.<br>  <br>  Bacteria are easy, you can grow them without having them infect cells, just a culture in a dish of raw bacteria. There are some exceptions, like TB which grows best when it's inside a living human cell.|`|GKAZ8SKVaa	the flu virus is grown in eggs (which is why you can't have it if you are allergic to eggs), and then killed to put in the vaccine.  Other viruses also are grown in eggs, and other methods..........the original vaccines (some of them anyhow) were taken from people who had been sick, once you were able to isolate them in a lab, you could reproduce them (similar to bacteria).  i've heard some were grown in monkeys.  Once you have the virus isolated, it's easy enough to grow it and reproduce it.

9DzY3n7xaa	Very popular question..Seems a lot of people are misinformed or not taught at all, as i wasn't at a younger age. so heres my usual answer:<br>  You have Phimosis. To help with it, try stretching exercises, when erect just pull it back as far as it will go and hold for 5 mins. Do this a few times daily.. in the shower helps, and you should see results within days/weeks. Could also try, if its possible to pull back a bit, pull it back, grab the glands with two fingers and roll the foreskin up over the two fingers as far as it will go (when the ring of skin turns white). hold it there for 5 mins. Lubricant helps with this!. Or get a prescription from your doc for Betamethasone cream 0.05%. It's fairly common, and this should help. Also try rubbing vitamin E around the top and inside the foreskin, which may help elasticate it. If it's more serious, you may need a preputialplasty (alternative to circumcision but with no loss of looks, sensetivity or anything, and is less painful with a fast recovery rate. With a preputialplasty:they make a small incision vertically then horizontally in your foreskin, and stitch it up to have more space for your glans to appear without a total circumcision. This is a quick procedure they may even just do in a doctors office.. so may be possible privately.<br>  Speak to your GP about it.)<br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  **edit- make sure you do not pull it over the head till it is ready.. if you do, it may be too tight to reverse, and you will have a condition called paraphimosis, where the skin stops the blood flow, and then your only option is a circumcision. And if you are in the Uk, the cream that the urologist above recommends isn't available. No steroid creams here are available without prescription. You have to use betamethasone 0.05%-0.1% for around a month or so..**<br>  <br>   Best idea would be to go to a drop in clinic.. not your family GP, if you are concerned or embarrassed. They see many problems like this or worse and can give you the advice and treatment needed. If you leave it too long.. the build up of smegma etc may cause an infection and worse problems. So yeah, see a doc..they've seen it all before.<br>  <br>  |`|E64juLwJaa	Go see your Dr about it.He can give you numbing cream to try to retract more each day.<br>  Cubes<br>  |`|LMNiS92laa	normal. jack off more and it'll stretch a bit.|`|T9OLDgngaa	It is perfectly normal for a foreskin not to uncover the head when you have an erection.  Foreskins like all parts of the body come in all sizes and lengths.  If it feels a bit tights just pull it backwards and forewards over the erect head of your penis so that it gets used to doing it.  Over time it will stretch and feel comfortable.|`|aRmf7Wknaa	This is a medical condition that can be corrected without surgery.<br>  Ask your GP for a prescription ointment (I forget the name) that is said to be able to correct this.<br>  |`|v1S86yeyaa	Look into ways to slowly stretch your foreskin.  No need to get your foreskin cut off.|`|ynj5po8maa	Its perfectly normal|`|hkL2KbpDaa	It is normal, some foreskins don't retract at all so that fact that yours does a little is defo normal. I had this same problem, my foreskin only came back so far and it was a pain because you don't get as much feeling from sex as you do from the inside of the foreskin. I went to the doctor about it and I had an operation to have my frenum cut and my foreskin retracts all the way now and sex is 10000000% better. I defo reccomend you go to see your doctor about having an operation, the NHS do it and I had to wait about 3 months but it was defo worth it.<br>  <br>  EDIT - oops sorry didn't see that you was only 14. I reccomend you talk to your parents about it. It is correct that it will strech as you get old but if you are still not happy with it by the time you turn 20 go and see a doctor and look into having the operation, it's painless and it really helps!! :)|`|EvuGnLOOaa	I had never been able to pull my foreskin back because it was so tight. I could get erect and pee fine, but when i went to the toilet it used to swell up, then go back down when i was done. I went to the doctors tons of times from when i was a baby until when i was 11, they kept saying i'd grow out of it. But then they said i had to be circumsized, and thats what happened. Anyway, see a doctor man. We can't see or make an analysis on your penis, because 1: Most of us aren't doctors.<br>  2: Writing is not enough to tell us about it.<br>  <br>  I had to get circumsized, and its tons better. Its cleaner, and you can't get nasty infections without a foreskin. So its all good ^_^ <br>  Cut is better|`|gl83EWfSaa	You have a tight foreskin and youneed to stretch it out. All you have to do are excersises. Just get a full erection and pull the skin back as far as you can without pain and then hold it for 5+ mins and do that 3+ times a day. You don't need to be circumcised.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|wpdcJmIXaa	Robert B has given you a perfect answer your still young it will stretch in time with no problem you do not need a circumcision so do not even think about it no worries kid ;-) x x x |`|RSBufJHUaa	So much for 'going natural.'

He will tell you it is normal, but you will be better at asking him things in the future.|`|AYwwsHWeaa	If it won't go back at all when you're erect, and if there is pain when you try, then you may need to be circumcised.  If, however, you are able to ultimately have sex (and masturbate now) without any pain, then you will be fine.|`|f2EbrS4Zaa	its perfectly normal.. try jus pulling d foreskin down n den taking it back again..<br>  do this for some time when erect or normal..<br>  doing this for a while will surely help it retracting in a few weeks or so..<br>  otherwise as u said.. it'll pain if u try to masturbate or hav sex..|`|OJen7R5Daa	yes its normal dont worry
pzLDXL6gaa	No, leave it in its correct position! Whoever told you that was wrong, the foreskin should be forward and covering the glans, that is its job. Also, leaving it back means it could get stuck. So don't do it.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|PAvYZJK2aa	best to leave it forward and have it covered but pull back to wash it daily!!|`|3156c54d8f966e51776af0486120bb1daa	You are very fortunate that your foreskin retracts easily.  There is absolutely no harm in leaving your foreskin retracted provided you can retract easily after erection as well as when flaccid, and that when erect and retracted the foreskin doesn't constrict the shaft.<br>  <br>  Training your foreskin to stay permanently retracted allows the glans to lose its excessive sensitivity to light touch (but not to sexual stimulation) and aids cleanliness - although nothing like as much as a circumcision would do.<br>  <br>  Initially it may be a bit uncomfortable whilst you adjust to having an exposed glans and the bunch of foreskin behind the glans, but after a while you will find it perfectly normal to be like this.<br>  <br>  Because you still have your foreskin it is important to smooth it fully back to wash it at least morning and evening so as to remove smegma and thus prevent disease.|`|diq9htpuaa	No, that simply isn't true.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is there to protect the glans and surrounding tissues, keeping them moist and sensitive for the most enjoyable sexual experience.<br>  <br>  Keeping it back will diminish your sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  It's not comfortable because that's not the way it's supposed to be.<br>  It's even more uncomfortable to have your foreskin chopped off by circumcision.   <br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.|`|NhWvvJ4saa	well by leaving it back, it should in time desensitise the head of your penis, and hopefully make you "last" longer during intercourse, (when your old enough).|`|ynj5po8maa	ITs perfectly fine. Circumcised people have their head exposed all the time. I personally feel it is uncomfortable to pull it back|`|9jGN14Hmaa	No, you could potentially create have an issue (paraphimosis) where if the head of the penis somehow swells up (lets say during sleep) and the foreskin becomes trapped behind the head which could constrict bloodflow, cause more swelling and then require a visit to the emergency room.<br>  <br>  The "last longer" thing is retarded, there are much healthier things you can do to increase the length of intercourse.<br>  <br>  The "women prefer circed" thing is also retarded, a woman worth keeping wouldn't care if you are intact or circed.  Besides, circumcision popularity is on its way out, not in.|`|OazyaOu4aa	You should just get circumcised if you are going to do that! Besides I have yet to meet a woman who thinks an uncircumcised penis looks better than one that is circumcised! That sh!t is just gross like a turtle with his head constantly in his shell.|`|7Ih4RHOoaa	Im circumcised but it seems like it will stretch the foreskin making it easier to pull back when it isnt retracted? idk just a guess.|`|9o5di0LVaa	Thats bullshit. Leave it the way it stays normally.|`|I3VfRjYLaa	What a load of nonsense. Whoever told you that it is healthier is full of sh!t.|`|gl83EWfSaa	NOOOOO! Don't do that.

NKpGPLYxaa	Yep cold sores ARE herpes<br>  and stress is the biggest trigger to herpes outbreaks...<br>  <br>  You'll be fine - get some Abreva - use that until it scabs - then leave the scab dry so it'll go away<br>  <br>  Be careful of who & where you kiss when you feel a tingle, itch or see a sore <br>  (especially small children we kiss in a motherly way...they're innocent...keep them that way)|`|fk9AvB25aa	Yes it does. Cold sores are the same thing as oral herpes (HSV1).<br>  Stressful situations can often trigger (cause) out breaks. Also prolonged exposure to sun and extreme temperatures and trigger oral herpes out breaks.<br>  All it takes is your immune system to weaken with an illness, or be run down with stress then oral herpes can break out.<br>  Oral herpes and gential herpes are different strains of the same herpes virus.<br>  Oral herpes is contagious while there is an out break but there is still a small chance of passing it on between out breaks and while it heals<br>  Do not give oral sex if you have an out break. Oral herpes can be passed to the genitals, but it usually likes to live and occur on the mouth.<br>  Once you have one type of herpes you will be less likely to get it again on your body after antibodies for it have built up.<br>  4 out of 5 people (80-90 percent) in the world have oral herpes so they are kind of common to have.<br>  If you have oral herpes you can use creams like Abreva or Lipactin to help heal and prevent out breaks.<br>  Herpes doesn't like to live long on object or dry surfaces for long periods of time.<br>  You can't get herpes just by touching some one or shaking their hand.<br>  Most people get oral herpes when they are a child by a friend or relative giving them a kiss on the cheek when they were a baby. They may have had one out break when they were too young to remember and never had one since.<br>  I have oral and gential herpes.|`|zMD0VeOmaa	cold sores by definition are a form of herpes i.e herpes simplex so yes. cold sores are very common so you are not alone.|`|009a0a10ffbf561298651550ecd50032aa	Herpes simplex virus can cause symptoms on the mouth (oral herpes) or genitals (genital herpes). <br>  <br>  <br>  About 50 to 80 percent of American adults have oral herpes, which is commonly called cold sores or fever blisters. <br>  <br>  <br>  About one in five adults in the United States has genital herpes. However, most people don’t know they are infected because their symptoms are too mild to notice or mistaken for another condition.<br>  <br>  <br>  Herpes is most easily spread from genital-to-genital or oral-to-genital contact during an active outbreak or during prodrome -- the few days just before an outbreak. <br>  <br>  <br>  Oral and genital herpes can be uncomfortable, but they are generally not dangerous infections in healthy adults.<br>  <br>  <br>  Herpes does not affect the immune system. It is rare for adults to have any health problems from genital herpes.<br>  <br>  <br>  However, having genital herpes makes it easier to acquire and/or transmit HIV, a virus that can cause AIDS. <br>  <br>  <br>  There are several days throughout the year when herpes can be spread even when no symptoms are present (called asymptomatic reactivation or asymptomatic shedding). <br>  <br>  <br>  The surest way to prevent the spread of genital herpes is to avoid sexual contact during an active outbreak and to use condoms for sexual contact between outbreaks. Suppressive (daily) antiviral therapy with valacyclovir has also been proven to reduce the risk of transmission to a partner. <br>  |`|FlYEQbCaaa	yes, it's herpes.  there are two types of herpes - 1 & 2.  and they are both related to chicken pox. type 1 is usually on your mouth and type 2 is usually genital.  but you can give yourself or your partner genital herpes with your cold sores.  so be sure to avoid oral sex and don't touch your mouth and then your genitals.|`|VegJGughaa	Yes but it's not the same as genital herpes.   There are different types of herpes and cold sores are in the same class as chicken pox.

AA11861088	Some guys get performance anxiety. They don't want other men catching a glimpse of their privates. It's nothing to do with comparison or size.

So they use the privacy of the urinal where they can relax.|`|1kVFdzdEaa	That all depends really.  Are the urinals full and the only available spot to release urine is in the stall?

I however, rarely ever sit in a public stall.  If i do, i have to line the seat with toilet paper.  Odd.   Maybe, but thats MY take on things.  I think though when you talk about a guy standing up to urinate, its just easier for us.

It's coming from inside you where all foreign bacteria are destroyed regularly; it's nearly sterile.<br>  <br>  You could use a dark colored sock.  Semen leaves a yellow stain on white clothes, but if the cloth has a dark color it won't be harmed at all.  Other than that, you can just let it land on your belly or chest, then wipe it up with some tissues, or plan ahead and put some tissues on your belly before you squirt.<br>  <br>  If you forgot to plan ahead and find yourself with a gooey belly and a long drippy trip to the tissue box, you could eat some of the excess first.

Naturally, depression could be harder to detect in children since they are less able to verbalize their feelings.<br>  <br>  If you believe you are depressed you might consider seeing a counselor who may refer you to a psychiatrist for a mental health evaluation where he/she would prescribe medication if they deem it necessary.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. Good luck.|`|RQEEwej5aa	There is so much discussion of definitions of mental disorders. But what it comes down to is whether any of the medication or other treatments available is actually of use. Presumably it is not a matter of severity but rather of whether the physiological state exists that is affected by treatment. Also what counts especially is symptoms that seem physically real - like signs of physical tension or inability to relax that are beyond normal day to day behaviour, or the kind of sleep loss that leaves someone unable to sleep sufficiently no matter how tired, or a kind of disorderedness which seems to be the result of real physical state of the brain.<br>  <br>  If the definitions of depression or schizophrenia are examined it looks like the conglomeration of a range of things basically put together for what reason - because they seem to respond a certain kind of drug therapy it would seem. Or it just seems right. It is a mess, or a mere convenience of ignorance, rather than real.
zMD0VeOmaa	Please do not follow this diet. It is a fad diet. Fad diets do not work.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you what I do not like about this diet. This diet does not provide sufficient fat or protein. Both are essential nutrients. This is basically a semi-starvation diet. You will lose lots of lean muscle mass as your body wastes away.<br>  <br>  It is very difficult for people to sustain wt. loss of more than 1 lb a week. A pound of fat= 3500 calories. If you burn 500 calories more per day than you eat than you will lose 1 lb a week. If you lose more than this you are losing water weight by dehydrating yourself, losing weight at an unsafe rate through semi-starvation, and you will not be able to maintain this weight loss.<br>  <br>  Don't believe me? Americans spend billions on weight loss programs and products each year. If these fad diets worked than 2/3 of adult Americans would not be overweight or obese.<br>  <br>  Losing weight takes patience, persistence, and a desire to learn how to eat healthfully. Most people find that exercise is needed to help them create a large enough calorie deficit to lose weight. There is no quick fix.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight I would highly recommend talking to a registered dietitian (RD). An RD is a nutrition expert that can help set up a customized diet plan for you to help you lose weight. Contact your local hospital for more information. Good luck.|`|bN51D6JDaa	You know that just doesn't sound very good to me.  You will gain the weight back as quickly as you lost it once you stop.

Fruits are NOT nature's perfect food. And where is the protein? 
pcGgavNtaa	First thing is your eating habits. What type of foods are you eating? Fried, burgers, rice, pasta, potatoes, etc?  Need to really look at that. Need to eat 4-5 small meals through out the day. Small amount (about the size of your palm) of protein and then a veggie.  Eat fresh fruit too. Eliminate sodas and sugary drinks. <br>  Exercise doing different things. Ride a bike, walk on treadmill, do the ab workout, boxing aerobics, swimming. Lift weights (12-15 reps per exercise) This will build lean muscle and not bulk.  Mix it up.  Keeps the muscles confused and the weight will come off faster. <br>  Find someone to workout with and be an encourager to you. You did not hit 250 lbs. overnight and you will not lose it overnight. Keep track of how far/fast you go on treadmill, swim, bike etc. Helps to see progress. Set realistic goals. Say 5 lbs in the first two weeks. Then 10 pounds in next month. You may see it come off faster.  Then just readjust. If you do not keep trying. <br>  As you lose the weight you will feel better and you will have much more energy.<br>  <br>  Good luck. |`|ad1HXt45aa	My best advice is that you don't have to feal like crap when you get out of the gym. If your feeling kinda lazy and you don't want to do a strenuous workout just go to the gym and walk for an hour. You can bring a magazine or watch TV to pass the time. You can also raise the incline on the treadmill to get a better workout in. Also get into a routine, the hardest part is getting to the gym, but once your there it gets allot easier. Don't exercise at home, unless you absolutely have too. Too many distractions and other activities within an arms reach.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. |`|o3hBfL2gaa	research what food have little fat in them . <br>  do NOT eat anything with alot of calories in it , even if its your cheat day or whatever . <br>  <br>  <br>  i know its hard to stop eating , im 13 and really skinny , but i eat nonstop . its crazy ! illl prob be fat when i grow up , but whatever lol .<br>  <br>  you should also excersize alot . if you are overwight , you will prob get tired faster , its normal , but you will get used to it . no offence or anything . <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i used to think im overwight and try to loose wight , lol i got almost tooooo skinny . but i think it worked (:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh and ps. try to set a goal for yourself , and keep doing a diet until you reach it . <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  pps. read star magazines, they have good star diets in them (:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helpedddd !<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqcG1E4Y1HUSTfQB.1m3CMbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081027192544AAMqo7q">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> |`|CMW2nFn8aa	the weight watchers plan works the best|`|K2yusOeEaa	USE THE ATKINS DIET.

DFJ9m4WKaa	If this guy is harassing you because you are jewish then you should talk to your principle and let him know that is why he is doing it. Intolerance in high schools is a pretty big deal and maybe if gets into trouble he'll cool it.<br>  <br>  On the other hand it could make matters worse. In fact doing anything could make it worse or it might involve more of this guys friends and some real hate crimes. At any rate its not something I would take lightly. I would make a stand if I were you. I would hold my ground and let this kid know that you do not appreciate what he is doing to you. And if he makes a big deal tell him that if he wants you can settle the matter off school grounds. And if he wants to take the next step that's when you use your intimidation. <br>  <br>  I know violence is never the solution and I would only use that as a last resort. But when I was in high school I met the same bullies I did in middle only by the time I made it to high school I was proficient at martial arts. And when I kicked the bloody snot out of those older and much larger kids they left me alone. So again if it comes down to it that he only wants to escalate the situation - hold your own and don't take **** from no one.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Whatever you do - don't stoop to his level!  That's what he wants.  Don't go there!  You are a better peson than that.  You need to catch him alone somewhere & give him a good old fashioned lecture - away from an audience.  He wants the attention & publicity.  He is obviously prejudiced & it's probably inherited.  If it begins to be more than you can handle, file a complaint for harrassment with your principal's office.|`|5HOMRUeMaa	First, don't stoop to his childish antics, like throwing his luck.<br>  Second, pull him aside, ask him what the deal is-you haven't done anything to him.

If the teachers are aware , then they can observe this behavior and see if it occurs with other students as well. Don't assault him. He is a bully and they are insecure about who know's what. Immediately get up walk away/ Go to the principals office when know one is around so they don't know it's you and you have a right to do this he is provoking you. He'll probably end up in jail someday. Also, bring up what he said about religion. This doesn't go over well anywhere, but , I know schools don't tolerate his mouth or behavior.. |`|zMD0VeOmaa	I can sympathize with you b/c I was bullied alot back in school. I'm 25 so I don't get bullied anymore but it has not been that long since I've been in school so I can probably give you some advice that will help you.<br>  <br>  It does not matter how big you are. I was always 1 of the biggest, strongest kids at school although I wasn't very athletic. I got picked on for being a good student and b/c I tended to be passive(not the type to fight back). I'm glad you don't want to get suspended b/c this little shrimp is not worth getting angry over. I've been suspended for fighting and it's not worth it.<br>  <br>  From my experience talking to principal or teachers does not help. They cannot do anything to stop bullying b/c they can't always be there for you. Bullying often happens in the locker room when none of the teachers are around.<br>  <br>  I think your friend gave you good advice. Stay calm under pressure. Play back at this guy. Who knows maybe he will be nicer to you if you show him that you have a sense of humor. If he says hey Jew, say hey shrimp or hey my name is Fred or whatever your name is. Or you could say something like that's Mr. Jew to you ******** and laugh. You can stick up for yourself w/o losing your cool. Throwing his bag across the room will not accomplish anything and just make you look like an asshole in front of everybody. Maybe you can talk to his g/f and tell her that her b/f needs to tone it down. Who knows maybe she can talk some sense to him. She will be more inclined to do so if she thinks you are a nice guy not out to brutalize her b/f.<br>  <br>  If you do suspect a fight is imminent you are on the lacrosse team so I suspect you have lots of friends that would have your back. I was on the swim team in high school, which gave me similar protection. I can't imagine that he really wants to fight you though. If necessary you can walk around w/ your lacrosse buddies and he will definitely not want to **** with you.<br>  <br>  When he touches your bag say hey that's my ****, don't touch it." Or if you wanted me to move my bag why didn't you say so? After all, maybe the guy just wanted to sit next to his g/f and your bag was in the way. <br>  <br>  I think talking to him would likely be a waste of time unless you think he is open to reason. Fighting him is not worth it if you can avoid it. If it's unavoidable do it off school grounds.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I hope you're able to resolve the situation.|`|ieWr28cCaa	Simple, when its like a passing period or whatever, grab him by his collar/shirt.. hold him to a locker, and tell him to cut his **** out, or your going to hurt him... if he dosent cease, then maybe you need to punch him, or if you wanna take a poon way out tell a princapl|`|GpaXi6Jdaa	i would tell him if he thinks he's tough **** to meet you at a spot off school grounds to fight like men...if he avoids or gets scared you can make fun of his ***|`|YDW6Z9mnaa	haha nerd|`|twg31O3caa	I don't get why he's messing with you he's small compared to you.

It doesn't' sound like he's picking on you because of your size but more because you are Jewish. What he is doing is actually illegal and your school MUST stop him or he (and they) can be named in a law suit that your parents can bring about. So, what do you do? Go to your PRINCIPAL (forget the coach and teachers, they won't do much) and explain what is happening.  Bring a few other credible witnesses with you to drive your point across.  Then have him call the student down to his office while you are there and confront him. Believe me, he'll be to afraid NOT to stop because he can be suspended from the school.  <br>  You might not think this will work but give it a try before you deck the kid and get yourself in trouble for something he is doing.  I've been a In-School Suspension monitor for 10+ years (plus I have 2 grown sons) so I know what I'm talking about and how the system works.  What ever you do, DON'T hit this kid because you are the one who will suffer for it, not him.

Classical conditioning was discovered as a result of the work done by the Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov . Pavlov did a study with dogs where they were given treats after ringing a bell.

If your burns are severe enough the doctor might prescribe an oral steroid such as prednisone or an analgesic (pain reliever).<br>  <br>  It's best to know how much of your body has been burned and to what extent so that you can get the best care possible.

Sinusitis itself is an inflammation in the sinuses, and this can be caused by a deviated septum (crooked nose), weak immune system, secondary infection (after a cold), chronic allergies etc. i had a septoplasty, which straightened my deviated septum, as i had chronic sinus infections and secondary chest infections. If you had an operation to fix your nose, and still have sinusitis, there may be other causes. A cold, hayfever, anything of the sort. Try some antihistamines, or consult a doctor. Hope this helps|`|HltUWMgOaa	Three good answers on sinusitis. When the middle "bone" in you nose is to one side you are said to have a Deviated Septum.

zMD0VeOmaa	5 min is normal. Here's what I would suggest to you:<br>  <br>  If you want to last longer try using the stop/start method when you masturbate. Once you feel like you are on the brink of orgasm stop stimulating yourself. If you do this a few times and do it regularly when you masturbate I guarantee you will have better control over your orgasm. You can easily last 15-20 minutes using this method after training yourself.<br>  <br>  Don't ignore how good it feels! Sex is supposed to feel good!<br>  <br>  That is good that you care about satisfying your partner. That's a major step towards actually satisfying them. The truth is most women don't achieve orgasm through intercourse alone. Most of them require stimulation of the clitoris(clit) to have an orgasm. There is a number of ways to do this but you should ask her what she likes. Some women like the clit to be stimulated more indirectly or less pressure to be applied b/c the sensations are too intense. The clit is a very sensitive organ just like your penis.<br>  <br>  If you do not know where her clit is ask her or look it up in an anatomy page on the internet. This is very important carnal knowledge.<br>  <br>  You can stimulate the clit manually, with your tongue (cunnilingus), or you can try using a vibrating **** ring during intercourse. You can find vibrating **** rings in the condom aisle of most major stores. I would also use plenty of lubrication to keep her vagina from getting too dry. KY personal lubricant is good for this purpose and it is latex compatible.<br>  <br>  Again ask her what she likes. Maybe even have her guide your hands to the right spot. As you're doing it ask her, "Does this feel good?" Pay attention to her face and the noises she makes. Many times it's obvious if she doesn't like what you're doing. Good luck.|`|MQsmRyjXaa	Well, my boyfriend says when he wants to last longer, he tries to take his mind off how good it feels ? |`|sXMeKxaiaa	Recently I got an ebook which explains several natural exercises to stop premature ejaculation.It was very useful to me.Please contact me to get it.<br>  <br>  russellj980@yahoo.in<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|CVUML11paa	Sometimes my penis accidentally rubs against my shorts and I orgasm and sperm all over my gym shorts right in the middle of class. :(|`|AA12144852	yes but if u dont ever want to have sex again
Aej3lgQZaa	no. It has about 1/5 the caffiene of regular coffee. I think a cup or two a day would be fine for a pregnant woman.|`|zMD0VeOmaa	Decaf coffee has trace amounts of caffeine. It would be ok for most pregnant women to drink decaf coffee. Except you say you are allergic to caffeine. So I would avoid decaf coffee for this reason.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other foods/beverages to avoid would be chocolate or cocoa or tea. Caffeine free soda is ok b/c it does not have any caffeine.

You can buy egg white protein powder though and get more protein without the extra cholestrol and fat.<br>  <br>  Whey protein is milk based and of course soy protein is soybean based.  So if you have an allergy to one, use the other.  <br>  <br>  Your body breaks protein down into amino acids so you can also use amino acid (pills, powder) but personally, I think the body uses the protein better (just my opinion though). <br>  <br>  The thing about too much protein is that it can be hard on your kidneys.  Make sure you drink lots of water.|`|b606968466360cc0a514f2dbef518044aa	Whey protein is best for weight management and body building.Experts say just the egg white is best 'cause the yolk contains too much cholesterol and fat,but I say the whole egg's fine as long as it's eaten in moderation.|`|27810f3db34ddb60276e43c094515ab8aa	What is important is to know what is the requirement of protein for your body.Generally it is calculated as : The ideal body weight for your age and height / 2.2. ( subject to confirmation). This will be your daily protein requirement. You can have protein from either sources. From one eggwhite you get 3gms of protein.If milk is not suitable to you, you can opt for eggwhites. It is the best protein provider.|`|63e7d07965b8c7e9954abf3eb5054714aa	Whey protien is made from Milk and Soy is made from soy..

Whey i have one scoop in the morning and one after my workout in the evening. It depends on you what you would like to have as both are good. <br>  <br>  If you would like to get ripped then you have to re-evaluate your diet. Try to cut down on your Fat and Carbs intake and change your excrecise for cutting in like when doing curls for biseps then only go half way up. Ask your instructor he / she will advice you better. <br>  <br>  You should only have egg white as it contains protien. One egg white has arround 4 Grams of protien and can be had according to your liking Eg Fried, omlete, or even mixed in milk. If you having more than 5 eggs a day then  you can have one egg yellow also to balance it out. But remember Egg yellow contains a lot of fat and cholestrol so aviod having more than 1 or 2 during the day.

If you want to lose weight the correct and safe way that will stay off for the long-term, you need a good comprehensive exercise and nutrition plan.<br>  <br>  A good program looks like this:<br>  <br>  Always warm up and cool down<br>  <br>  Muscular Strength & Endurance-you need a good resistance training program that includes exercises for all muscle groups (hips, chest, upper and mid back, legs (quads and hamstrings), shoulders, lower back, upper arms (biceps and triceps), calves, forearms, abdomen, and the gluteus maximus).<br>  For muscular strength you need high weight and low reps. For muscular endurance you need high reps and low weight.  Both are very important to a workout program and I would suggest you to change it out every couple of weeks or so.<br>  For a beginner, your intensity should be 70-80% 1-RM or 8-12-RM, 8-12 reps, 1 or more sets, 3 times a week for 6 weeks or more when you begin a resistance program. You should begin with 1 exercise for each major muscle group and make sure the days you do resistance training are not consecutive meaning you don't exercise the same muscle group two days in a row. As you continue your program you can add more exercises, add weight, and change up your program to include more days or just work specific muscle groups on specific days. As your muscles grow stronger you will be able to reduce the rest time between each set. You should rest for about 30 seconds between sets. <br>  As you begin to learn more about weight lifting and gain more strength you can begin to change your program to either target muscular strength or endurance.<br>  For muscular strength you would decrease your reps and increase your weight.<br>  Start out trying 2 sets of 8 reps each and see how it works out. You can always add more reps but don’t go over 10 reps. <br>  You should fatigue your muscles by the 8th rep, especially on the 2nd set. If you are not getting to the point of fatigue this means you need to increase the weight. If you are not able to correctly perform 2 sets of 8 reps then that means you need to decrease the weight.<br>  For muscular endurance you would increase your reps and decrease your weight.  You should try to do 2-3 sets of 12-15 reps.  <br>  Muscle is metabolically active and therefore when you gain muscle it burns more calories and helps to raise your metabolism.<br>  If you do not have money for a gym membership or do not have access to one, here is a great website to create a work out plan only using your body weight.<br>  <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/exercises.php?MainMuscle=&Equip=BodyOnly&Isolation=" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/exercise...</a><br>  You can also search for all kinds of exercises that use weight.<br>  Here is another great website for finding some good exercises for different parts of the body.<br>  <a href="http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/Strength_Exercises.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/St...</a><br>  Here is a great link to a comprehensive musculoskeletal atlas of the body to help you understand what exactly you are working<br>  <a href="http://www.preventdisease.com/home/muscleatlas/content.html#102" rel="nofollow">http://www.preventdisease.com/home/muscl...</a><br>  Also, if you are having trouble deciding what type of program you should be doing, here is a website that may help you to better understand the different forms of strength.<br>  <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kelly2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kelly2.h...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Cardiovascular Endurance-This part is extremely important for fat burning and enhancing your overall cardiovascular performance.  You need to include a warm-up and cool-down.  In order to have an effective cardio plan you must first make sure you remain in your target heart rate zone for at least 30 minutes a day (you can start out doing this for 3 days a week and build up) and then you can build up to 45-60 minutes a day.  This will seriously help to burn fat as well as raise your VO2Max which is basically a number that represents the capacity of your cardiorespiratory system.  The higher the number the more efficient your cardio system is.  You can learn more about VO2 at the following website.<br>  <a href="http://www.preventdisease.com/news/articles/vo2_max_how_fit_athlete.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.preventdisease.com/news/artic...</a><br>  In order to determine your target heart rate, do the following:<br>  know these numbers:<br>  maximum heart rate= (220-age)<br>  resting heart rate=(get this by counting your pulse for a minute when you first wake up in the morning)<br>  heart rate reserve=(maximum heart rate-resting heart rate)<br>  then calculate training intensity:<br>  TI= Heart rate reserve x percentage(use 70%-85%) + resting heart rate<br>  Now your training intensity number is important because this is the number you want to reach for a particular training intensity.  This is the number your heart rate has to get to in order to be in the optimum cardio training zone.<br>  You can perform the TI equation for 70% and then another for 85% to get a good range for your heart rate.  This is your own personal target heart rate zone.<br>  You can either count your pulse yourself or use a heart rate monitor while you are exercising.  You can buy one at most electronic stores.  I recommend the heart rate monitor because you don't have to do anything and it lets you know where you are.    Some even beep when you reach your zone or when you go above it.  Mine has a strap you put on under your clothes and a watch that shows you your heart rate as well as other things.  Now of course, any type of heart rate monitor will not be perfect because there are factors that are not taken into account, but it is one of the most accurate ways to keep track of your heart rate that is easily available to the public.<br>  Here is a website to help you calculate your target heart rate zone<br>  <a href="http://www.preventdisease.com/healthtools/articles/thr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preventdisease.com/healthtool...</a><br>  Here is a good website for some information on how to measure your physical activity intensity<br>  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/physical/measuring/met.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/physical...</a><br>  Now, I needed to tell you all of that so I can let you know what cardio activities will fit this type of requirement.  <br>  The following are great activities for a good aerobic plan:<br>  cycling, jogging, running, walking, rowing, stair climbing, elliptical machine, aerobic dance, bench step aerobics, hiking, in-line skating, skiing, rope skipping, swimming, and water aerobics.  <br>  Any of these activities are acceptable only if you make sure your heart rate stays within your target heart rate zone.  This does not count your warm-up or cool-down either.  You need at least 30 minutes within your zone for the best benefits because for most people your body does not begin to burn fat until you have been working aerobically in your heart rate zone for at least 30 minutes.  Of course all exercise is good for you, so even if you do not make it to your heart rate zone, it still is good for you and there will be benefits from it.  Just work your way up, start slow, and you will be gradually improving your body's cardiovascular performance and burning fat.  Once your body gets used to performing aerobically it will begin to burn fat faster than someone who is not on a cardio program.  <br>  <br>  You can find calculators at the following website to calculate about how many calories are burned by different activities.<br>  <a href="http://www.preventdisease.com/healthtools/tools.html#bctwr" rel="nofollow">http://www.preventdisease.com/healthtool...</a><br>  Here are a few websites that will help you to begin a fitness walking program<br>  <a href="http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/fitness_walking.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/fi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/walking_schedule.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/wa...</a><br>  Or if you prefer, you can begin a jogging program<br>  <a href="http://preventdisease.com/fitness/fitness_jogging.html" rel="nofollow">http://preventdisease.com/fitness/fitnes...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Body Composition-this includes your body fat percentage, bone frame, as well as how much muscle you have. Most people focus on only weight, but you should not put as much focus on that as much as what your body fat percentage is (get it tested at an exercise facility with skinfold calipers). You should also get circumference measurements done. This includes your neck, shoulder, chest, waist, abdominal, hip (buttocks), thigh (proximal), thigh (mid), thigh (distal), knee, calf, ankle, arm (bicep), forearm, and wrist. You should be able to do this at a gym. You should get all of this information done before you start your program and then you can see how you improve.<br>  You can calculate an estimate of your body composition and target weight here:<br>  <a href="http://www.preventdisease.com/healthtools/tools.html#bctwr" rel="nofollow">http://www.preventdisease.com/healthtool...</a><br>  The following website will help you to understand a little more about body composition<br>  <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/articles/muscle_vs_fat_measure_what_matters.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://preventdisease.com/news/articles/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Flexibility- Most people do not even think about this, but it is very important because it helps to prevent injury and it helps you to perform every day activities. It also has an effect on all your other programs. You should perform 10-12 flexibility exercises every day. Slowly stretch the muscle to a point of mild discomfort but not necessarily pain. Hold stretch for 10-30 seconds, and do 3-5 reps for each stretch. This should take about 15-30 minutes per session. If you do not have time to do this every day, try to do it 2-3 times a week.<br>  Here are some good websites to learn more about flexibility and stretching<br>  <a href="http://preventdisease.com/fitness/fundament/articles/stretching.html" rel="nofollow">http://preventdisease.com/fitness/fundam...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cmcrossroads.com/bradapp/docs/rec/stretching/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cmcrossroads.com/bradapp/docs...</a><br>  <br>  Diet- You have to make sure that you eat right and that means following the food guide pyramid.  All those low carb diets or fad diets out there will not help you lose weight safely.  You can read more about the risks of low carb diets at the following website<br>  <a href="http://www.preventdisease.com/news/articles/032006_low-carb.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.preventdisease.com/news/artic...</a><br>  Know that 1 lb. of fat is equal to 3,500 calories.  So if you eat 500 calories less per day for a week than you normally would (by either cutting back or changing what you eat or even by burning 500 calories from exercise) that is 3,500 calories and you should lose 1 lb. that week.  I know that does not sound like a lot, but it is a proven fact that you should not lose more than 1-3 lbs. per week because it is not safe nor does it stay off.  If you work to lose 1-3 lbs a week then it is much more likely to be the safe way and will stay off for long-term if you continue to live a healthy lifestyle.<br>  I do not like the word diet because most people think of a diet as a short-term way of losing weight when the most effective way of losing weight is to completely change your lifestyle.  <br>  Here are some ways to change the way you eat:<br>  Always follow the food guide pyramid with focus on fruits and vegetables and lean meat such as chicken or fish.  <br>  Make sure you get enough fiber and water in your diet.  You should get 20-30 grams of fiber every day along with plenty of water.  You can go to the following websites to  learn more about fiber and tips on how to get more in your diet.  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/solutions/fiber-super-nutrient/power_of_fiber" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/solutions/fiber-sup...</a><br>  <a href="http://preventdisease.com/home/tips65.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://preventdisease.com/home/tips65.sh...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/solutions/fiber-super-nutrient/six_ways" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/solutions/fiber-sup...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fiberseekers.com/fiber_counter.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fiberseekers.com/fiber_counte...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/solutions/fiber-super-nutrient/symptoms_check" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/solutions/fiber-sup...</a><br>  You should drink a total of 8 eight-ounce glasses of water a day at least.  This is different for everyone, but you should be able to figure out about how much water you need a day.  You can go to <br>  <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/articles/how_much_water.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://preventdisease.com/news/articles/...</a> to learn more about how much water you should drink.   <br>  Get your carbs from complex carbohydrates (pasta, rice, grains, cereals, potatoes, dried beans and peas) that contain whole wheat.  When you buy something such as bread make sure the first ingredient is whole wheat and does not contain the word enriched.  You can learn more about carbohydrates at the following website.<br>  <a href="http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/weightloss/articles/carbs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/we...</a><br>  You can also learn how to choose healthy breakfast cereals at the following website<br>  <a href="http://www.drmirkin.com/nutrition/N180.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drmirkin.com/nutrition/N180.h...</a><br>  Learn what serving sizes are and how to properly use them.  This is very important because the average American consumes way too much and it is because serving sizes are out of control.

Choose low fat or low calorie food items such as a salad ( fat-free cheese and dressing), grilled chicken sandwich, etc.  When you go out to eat you can also split an entree with someone or ask them to put half in a to-go box in the back before they even bring it to you.

Mono and polyunsaturated fats or good for you but fat should only make up 25-35% of total calories.

These results were presented on June 26 at the annual meeting of the Institute of Food Technologists, held in New Orleans. Antioxidants continue to be the hot topic in product development circles, as science is looking beyond basic nutrition to nutraceutical substances.<br>  <br>  This study characterised the specific antioxidant content of seven varieties of honey. The antioxidant properties of these seven varieties of honey were analysed using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay. Components identified in the honeys included phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid, and the enzymes glucose oxidase, catalase, and peroxidase.<br>  <br>  Antioxidant capacity of the honeys investigated appeared to be primarily due to their phenolic composition as opposed to enzymatic antioxidants and ascorbic acid. Enzyme activity and ascorbic acid were very low, if not undetectable, in all honeys tested. Chromatograms of phenolic fractions of honeys indicated that most honeys have similar but quantitatively different phenolic profiles. A previous study at the same university, using spectophotometry, determined that the antioxidant capacity of honey varied by floral source. That study did not determine the individual honey compounds that are responsible for the activity.<br>  <br>  Characterisation of honey helps in understanding its antioxidant behaviour and therefore its use as a natural food ingredient and as a source of antioxidants in the human diet. Researchers at the university are now studying the effect of honey on the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation in the blood|`|AA12350891	I have not heard much about antioxidant capacity assigned to honey. Honey is mainly sugar (Fructose) which has very little oxidation potential but is very very sweet. There are many organic compounds and proteins imparted to the honey during the digestion process in the bee, but these are in very small quantities.<br>  <br>  The honey's character is VERY dependant on the flower being worked by the bees:<br>  <br>  - Clover honey is the most popular for mass producers. It is very light and sweet.<br>  <br>  - Golden Rod honey is a medium dark honey with more flavor than clover honey.<br>  <br>  - Buckwheat honey is so dark you can barely see thru it and is loaded with flavor.<br>  <br>  If you want good (real) honey you MUST get it from a local bee keeper that processes a little as possible. I would warm it slightly and strain it thru cheese cloth to remove the body parts (wings, legs, etc.) and sell it without further processing. I had several people in the area that would buy from me each spring. They take a tablespoon a day because it really cuts down on their hay fever. There is enough pollen left in the honey to crank up your ammune system before allergie season arrives. Most commercial honey producers heat to boiling to kill all of the enzymes, then run it thru the equivalent of 5-7 swimming pool filters to remove all traces of pollen, royal jelly, etc. All that's left is sugar.

I'm 5'2'' also, and have about the same size breasts as your wife. My backpain is constant, every minute of every day, and many different doctors has told me it's because of my breasts. My surgery covers this proceedure because it is medically necessary to alleviate the pain. If your wife doesn't do something about this she will have back pain for the rest of her life, and it will only get worse. She is probably damaging the curvature of her spine (I did). With larger breasts on her small frame, there probably aren't any bras that will alleviate the pain. I tried wearing really supportive sports bras for awhile but it did nothing for me. The reduction surgery itself is very common and only takes a few days to a week to recover from. I know you don't want her to have surgery, but coming from someone in the same situation who hates medical offices/proceedures/needles/etc, it's my only solution.|`|965eed28f2f217a1ea59f9d95917483caa	she needs a breast reduction  she has too big of breast and that cant hold a small body so that will cause her back to hurt

I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.<br>  <br>  Many patients travel from United States of America and UK to get low cost surgery in India.

You should eat 5 or 6 small & healthy meals a day ("small" & "healthy" being the key words here) to increase your metabolism. Eating only once or twice a day actually hurts you more than it helps.

Here are some steps (#3 is most important).<br>  <br>  Causes<br>  IBS can be caused by a variety of factors, including poor diet and nutrition, food allergies, imbalanced levels of hydrochloric acid, impaired immunity, infections, lack of exercise, pharmaceutical drugs, and stress.<br>  <br>  <br>  Quick Action Plan for IBS<br>  <br>  1. Avoid all sugars, refined flour products, and carbohydrates, milk and dairy products, processed foods that contain preservatives and artificial sweeteners, alcohol, hydrogenated and trans-fatty oils, as well as foods that are common allergens. <br>  <br>  2.

AA11612448	The Six Hidden Dangers in Walking for Weight Loss<br>  <br>  If you are able to, stop walking, and start 'intervaling'<br>  <br>  Walking will keep your heart rate relatively low. Walking will train your body to burn calories more efficiently (this is bad). Walking will not raise your metabolism to the level that is should be at the burn more fat and process food at faster rates. Walking will not help you build any muscle. Walking will take along time to see end results. Walking will program your body to gain more weight in the future.<br>  <br>  <br>  Intervals will raise your heart rate. Intervals will raise your metabolism for up to 48 hours after the interval workout. Intervals will teach your body to burn more calories per day, per hour, even per minute of being awake or while sleeping. Intervals will also deliver greater results much, much faster.<br>  <br>  What are cardio intervals and who are they for?<br>  <br>  Cardio intervals can be described as a form of mixed speeds of cardio. Instead of staying at one speed throughout the workout, you will start off with a slow speed to warm up. Progress to a FAST speed for up to 2 minutes followed by another slow speed for twice the amount of time as the FAST speed. You will repeat this for up to 30 minutes of total workout time.<br>  <br>  Cardio intervals are virtually designed to enhance the overall performance of anyone who does them. For the most part, they can be done by everyone. The main people that won't be able to handle intervals will be elderly, sick, injured, people who suffer from poor knees, ankles, hips, back injuries, etc.<br>  <br>  Simply implement the defined strategy above and watch your fat come running off of your body, literally.<br>  <br>  Matt Shuebrook, CPT<br>  Download your FREE copy of The Christian’s Guide To Maximal Weight Loss at <a href="http://www.ChristianhealthandFitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ChristianhealthandFitness.com</a> also for more great fitness tips from Matt Shuebrook go to <a href="http://www.FightFatPhilly.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.FightFatPhilly.com</a> and <a href="http://www.MyPhiladelphiaFitnessExpert.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.MyPhiladelphiaFitnessExpert.c...</a>|`|0f49406b90defffce3a0f65909e39bdaaa	Eat nourishing food with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables being part of it.

Not fun.<br>  I'm now in the habbit of eating breakfast WITH the medicine.  That way, whether or not I'm hungry for lunch (sometimes I am, sometimes not) I have something in my stomach.<br>  My hunger is more normal now that I've been on the Adderall several years.  I'm just not cut out to me anorexic ;)|`|NIFosAY4aa	My appetite is usually curbed almost to non-existent sometimes, and I'm tired alot when I'm on my pills. Actually you know, you dont have to take them all the time, just when you know you need them to concentrate on something, or you know you do better with them, than without. That's what I do. I don't take them all the time, only when I know it's needed, I don't know about my eyes always being dilated, I don't look into my eyes all the time haha, hope I helped. I suggest you just question your doctor about your dilated eyes. And you have to force yourself to eat, what the drug does, is tell you, you don't want to eat, and your stomach goes along with it, so even though you don't feel like eating, you should eat some snacks at least to keep in the vitamins, and minerals needed in the body.

iRnkEYmwaa	Often times, a ticklish reaction is a defense mechanism: you jerk away from the tickling sensation.<br>  This is especially true with muscular ticklishness.  If you're receiving a massage and have a ticklish reaction at certain points (like the outside of your thigh: the IT band and connected muscles) the tickling you feel may mean the pressure is on the verge of too much too fast on a tight, not warmed muscle.  If any deeper on that ticklish spot, it would be pain felt not ticklishness.<br>  That defense mechanism explanation works with an area like your belly.  Of course you want to defend your vital organs! If you're tickled too much there it also hurts.<br>  As for ticklish feet and under-arms, that may be more related to the numerous nerve endings.  Nerve endings are just sensitive.  And that certainly can get on your nerves! :)|`|b70e721857f81c4d64abaddfa0fedaabaa	Sensitivity.|`|AA10976149	Less exposed body parts, tend to be the most sensative.|`|XHbqXEBdaa	yea sensitivity

Don't be afraid to take a poke at yourself if you are feeling uncomfortable.  <br>  I have to speak in public often and I have had to do this on many occasions.  You would be surprised by 2 things... First,  most the people think you're doing ok and don't think you're choking.  Second.. people react well if you start to lose your composure and adjust with a jab at yourself.   Don't tell a joke, just make a comment like "Although I'm an expert at the subject matter I speak of..

My 20 year old son died from suicide 3 years ago.One of the biggest mistakes that people make is stopping their anti-depressant medication when they start to feel better, but the medicine is what makes them feel better. Always remember that suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem! PLEASE talk to someone right away! Good luck and God bless you!|`|39nI0iStaa	Most teenagers suffering from depression is not due to "mental" problems, but rather because of a Nutritional Disorder.<br>  <br>  Most people seem to think that depression is always "in the mind", but if you have a physical illness that prevents you from producing feel good neurotransmitters such as serotonin, you can be depressed without knowing why.<br>  <br>  Of course when we feel down it is natural to blame something in the environment or in the past, but this would simply be what psychologists call "projection".<br>  <br>  Most depressions have a biological basis and it has been found that many depressed people have hypoglycemia. This is a nutritional disorder caused by excess sugar consumption.<br>  <br>  When we consume too much sugar over a long period of time, we may develop "insulin resistance". This means that the body is not properly metabolizing sugar into biological energy, that the brain needs to manufacture the feel good neurotransmitters.<br>  <br>  Hence we become depressed.|`|yYujYJFZaa	Well for starters, you need to discover what your depressed about, and try to change the situation.  If your not able to pin point the situation, you may want to talk about it with a person you trust or maybe even write in a journal.  If you feel alittle more depressed about life in general you may want to go to a counselor and talk about the problems.  There are allot of depression pills out there, Talk to your doctor about it even with your parents.  Make sure that you ask about side effects with the pills, if you decide to go that way.  Some pills have side effects on teens that can make them even more depressed or suicidal if they stop taking them once they start.<br>  I wish you the best luck.<br>   I have been on depression pills for the last 5 years and they work really well for me.

mq7BYWktaa	Cómo prevenir y curar el dolor de cabeza<br>  El dolor de cabeza puede tener diferentes causas, y suele ser uno de los malestares más comunes. Aquí encontrarás algunas técnicas para librarte de un incómodo dolor de cabeza.<br>  <br>  Pasos<br>  Prevenir es mejor que curar. <br>  Relájate. La mayoría de los dolores de cabeza suelen ser provocados por tensión y/o agotamiento mental. Si estás trabajando, tómate un descanso cada una o dos horas, y no prolongues demasiado tu tiempo de trabajo. Si empiezas a sentirte distraído o abrumado, distánciate de lo que estás haciendo por unos momentos. Aprovecha el rato para tomar un refrigerio; recuerda que el cerebro, como cualquier músculo del cuerpo humano, necesita energía para funcionar a pleno. Si empiezas a sentirte agotado, considera continuar con tu trabajo después de algunas horas o incluso al día siguiente. <br>  No fuerces la vista. Pasarse largas horas con la vista fija en una peque?a área agota los músculos de tus ojos y puede producirte un dolor de cabeza. Pasar demasiado tiempo frente a un monitor o pantalla de televisión, por ejemplo, es perjudicial para la salud. Visita periódicamente al oftalmólogo y, si usas lentes, no dejes de usarlos para ninguna tarea que los requiera. <br>  Lleva una vida sana. Procura llevar una dieta balanceada, hacer deporte regularmente, y no abusar de tu cuerpo. El exceso de algunas sustancias como el cigarrillo o el alcohol puede ser causa de dolores de cabeza en muchas personas. <br>  Duerme bien. Asegúrate de dormir todas las horas que tu cuerpo necesita, pero mantiene un ritmo de sue?o regular. Si una noche no logras dormir lo suficiente, recuerda que es preferible permanecer cansado durante un día que dormir fuera de horas (romperás la rutina del sue?o y cada vez te será más difícil descansar bien). <br>  A pesar de las precauciones que tomes, es probable que ocasionalmente sufras un dolor de cabeza. En estos casos, hay varias maneras de tratarlo. <br>  Se moderado en el uso de analgésicos, incluso los de venta libre. Si tomas un analgésico de venta bajo receta, sigue siempre las dosis indicadas por el médico. <br>  Es posible que desarrolles una especie de acostumbramiento a tu analgésico y que, por consecuencia, éste deje de causar el efecto deseado. Para evitar o remediar esto, prueba alternar analgésicos con distintos componentes (como aspirina o ibuprofeno) o incluso diferentes marcas, y evitar tomar analgésicos con demasiada frecuencia. <br>  Practica técnicas de relajación y meditación. <br>  Intenta algún tratamiento homeopático o alternativo, como la acupuntura (ver Advertencias). <br>  Distráete. Lo creas o no, ésta técnica suele resultar muy efectiva. <br>  Unas cuantas horas de sue?o profundo también pueden ayudarte a librarte de un persistente dolor de cabeza. <br>  Si te duele la cabeza, evita forzar los músculos oculares. Esto sólo lo empeorará. <br>  Asimismo, evita forzar tu mente. No realices trabajos complejos o de intensa concentración si ienes un dolor de cabeza. <br>  Prueba diferentes actividades que promuevan la generación de endorfinas en tu cuerpo. Las endorfinas suben el umbral de dolor.<br>  <br>  Ingiere alimentos dulces (como chocolate o jugos de fruta) o que realmente disfrutes y te den placer comerlos, pero mantente alejado del helado (ver Advertencias). <br>  Realiza alguna actividad física, de la intensidad que sea mejor para tí. Recuerda que una actividad física demasiado intensa puede empeorar el dolor de cabeza. <br>  Sé paciente. Los dolores de cabeza normales, aunque parezcan insoportables, sólo duran algunas horas como máximo. <br>  Si llevas una vida sana, descansas bien y no estás permanentemente bajo tensión, pero igualmente sufres dolores de cabeza crónicos, considera la posibilidad de que haya una causa en particular (por ejemplo, una enfermedad virósica). Consulta a tu médico y asegúrate de seguir todas las indicaciones que te dé. Si estás en duda, consulta a otro médico y compara diagnósticos e indicaciones. Algunos dolores de cabeza también pueden ser psicosomáticos (si, por ejemplo, sólo te duele la cabeza cuando tienes que estudiar para un exámen, es posible que éste sea tu caso). Si ningún exámen clínico revela una causa para tus dolores de cabeza, considera consultar con un psicólogo profesional. <br>  <br>  Advertencias<br>  <br>  Ten cuidado con algúnas técnicas para librarse de dolores de cabeza. La acupuntura, por ejemplo, debe ser realizada por un profesional; presionar los nervios equivocados o de una manera incorrecta puede ser da?ino para tu salud. <br>  Siempre sigue las indicaciones de tu médico cuando ingieras un analgésico de venta bajo receta, o las del prospecto si es de venta libre. Una sobredosis de analgésicos puede tener consecuencias mucho más graves que un dolor de cabeza. <br>  El alcohol, incluso en peque?as cantidades, puede causar o empeorar un dolor de cabeza. <br>  La fiebre y las enfermedades virósicas suelen causar dolor de cabeza. Si notas otros síntomas que sugieran una enfermedad, consulta a tu médico. <br>  Algunos alimentos, como el helado, suelen causar dolores de cabeza que varían desde leves hasta intensos, desde breves hasta prolongados. <br>  Algunas actividades también suelen ser causales de dolor de cabeza. Reirse intensamente por largos períodos de tiempo, a pesar de ser beneficioso para la salud, puede agotar ciertas zonas del cerebro y causar un dolor de cabeza. Actividades de gran intesidad física o mental también suelen tener este efecto. Una conversación prolongada con un número considerable de personas, por ejemplo, puede tensionar algunas áreas del cerebro. <br>  Ten en cuenta que cuanto más pendiente estés de tu dolor de cabeza, más intenso éste se volverá. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://es.wikihow.com/prevenir-y-curar-el-dolor-de-cabeza" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikihow.com/prevenir-y-curar-e...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.laguna2000.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=44" rel="nofollow">http://www.laguna2000.com/index.php?opti...</a><br>  <a href="http://lalupa.com/Salud_y_medicina/Enfermedades_por_Tema/Dolor_de_Cabeza/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://lalupa.com/Salud_y_medicina/Enfer...</a><br>  <a href="http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061128011541AArfww4">http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.como-hacerlo.com/articles/66/1/-Como-se-quita-el-dolor-de-cabeza-/Page1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.como-hacerlo.com/articles/66/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.truveo.com/Los-beneficios-de-tener-sexo-Quita-hasta-el-dolor/id/1308739086" rel="nofollow">http://www.truveo.com/Los-beneficios-de-...</a><br>  <br>  saludos y suerte.|`|2cff7a59eb14ebe2a7543f05f980fa50aa	Pide que te hagan un masaje para que te relajes, ayuda tambien tomar naproxeno 400 mg cada 12 horas.  cuidate!|`|61dc969e905a171470064fd66bb94e36aa	Hola mira seguro te sientes como mareada y luego viene el dolor... luego el cuello en la parte de atras esta bien duro.. es porque tienes preocupaciones y estas muy estresada, ami me paso, si no puedes irte de viaje y olvidarte de todo almenos un dia entero, corre o haz ejercicios que ayuden a eliminar esa tensión, no es cosa de juego, si te empieza a doler el pecho como si te estarian apretando entonces ve al medico porque ya estas teniendo algunos problemas mas no te preocupes y espero que le hayas hecho entender a tu amiga que estaba masl cuidate y suerte|`|TcfrlzSsaa	Necesitas estar reposando en la comodidad de tu casa, un buen masaje y un rico te de siete azahares.

Muchas frutas y verduras. Evitá los fritos o comidas chatarra porque vas a sentirte más pesada de lo que te sentís.<br>  *Aunque suene contradictorio, caminá y hacé ejercicios suaves. Es preferible la caminata, a paso lento.<br>  *Recostate y colocá sobre tu viente, una bolsa de agua caliente. Relaja muchísimo.<br>  *Tomá un ba?o, intercalando chorros de agua fría y caliente (activa la circulación y hace que el flujo sanguíneo, fluya mejor)<br>  *No pienses en el dolor. <br>  *Si nada de esto surte efecto, tomá un AINES, (Antiinflamatorio no esteroideo).

Alguna vez he tenido que recurrir a otros medicamentos más fuertes, como los relajantes musculares (estilo Orfidal o Myolastán). Lo que pasa es que esos relajantes no a todos nos afectan igual. A algunas personas se lo mandan para dormir, porque al relajarse, se duermen antes y mejor, pero a mí no me producen ningún efecto en la cabeza y no noto diferencia con respecto al sue?o o a la relajación que notas (de los músculos en general) pero sí noto que me duele menos. <br>  <br>  Hay gente a la que no sólo le relajan sino que le producen somnolencia. Y a mí... me recetaron el Myolastán para una contractura fuerte del cuello y no sólo no me hizo efecto una pastilla... ni dos, ni tres, me tomé 4 y no noté nada de nada, ni cosquillas. Debe ser que me pasa algo raro con determinados medicamentos que no me producen el efecto "normal". Y en cambio hay otros (como el Relaxybis que me mandaron por otra contractura) que me tomo una y parece que voy drogada (me da la risa tonta y desvarío). <br>  <br>  <br>  Y ahora viene la alternativa SANA: dos cosas, el sexo y los homenajes. Debe ser porque el orgasmo libera endorfinas y a la vez produce sus propias contracciones de las zonas más irrigadas del útero y los genitales. El caso es que puede ayudar mucho a aliviar el dolor.|`|kb7d7dGEaa	Si las molestias son tan severas, te recomiendo acudir con tu ginecologo, para que te haga un ultrasonido, no sea que tengas algun tumor ovarico o endometriosis. <br>  Come chocolate unos dias antes de tu período.

u4NvfEevaa	Hay varias Razones.<br>  <br>  Generalmente aplican el término (fuegos labiales) a lesiones de los labios caracterizadas por peque?as vesículas, que aparecen siempre en un lugar determinado de ellos. Se acompa?an de dolor, ardor o picazón, además de hinchazón del labio. Evolucionan a costras que se desprenden en 7 a 10 días. Esto corresponde a un herpes simplex labial. <br>  <br>  El herpes es una infección viral producida por el virus del mismo nombre, que se adquiere habitualmente por contacto directo. El virus permanece para siempre en la persona que lo adquirió en un estado latente, y sufre reactivaciones frente a diferentes estímulos (todos relacionados con una inmunodepresión o "baja de defensas"), como exposición al sol, estrés, exceso de comida o bebida, cambios hormonales, fiebre alta, entre otros.<br>  <br>  Existen medicamentos antivirales de uso tópico y orales, que permiten acortar la duración de cada episodio, producir un alivio rápido de la sintomatología y disminuir la posibilidad de contagio. Por otra parte, frente a episodios muy frecuentes o de gran severidad se puede evaluar el estado inmunitario de la persona afectada, con el fin de realizar tratamientos orientados a producir una activación del sistema inmunitario, que prevenga o disminuya la frecuencia de los episodios. <br>  <br>  <br>  Besitos ?|`|AA10052473	Hola Aizi, te dejo el link con algo de la informacion, ese link te ayuda bastante con dudas respecto a emfermedades. <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/spanish/ency/article/000606.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/spani...</a>|`|f4c5279cd83f29a8222f19a8dcb6342baa	por bajas defenzas , gripe etc , el virus se contagia cuado somos bebes, ya sabes que todo mundo besa bebes, ahi lo pasan este virus esta latente en el organismo y necesita un detonador como puede ser una baja de defenzas, gripe, estres etc ,|`|rkAuuDPXaa	por estres|`|011752fb2907da16f6664cd8de39839faa	Por cambios bruscos en la temperatura de tu cuerpo, en una ocasión llegué a mi casa después de un día muy acalorado y lo primero que hice fue quitarme los zapatos y pisar el suelo que estaba algo fresco, a unos minutos sentí algo raro en mi labio inferior y si un fuego.

Para estas bacterias existen tratamientos que las matan -drogas bactericidas-. Para algunas enfermedades utilizamos medicación y para otra vacunas. De todas formas en muchos países se utiliza una forma de prevención anticaries que es el flúor en el agua de red. Si, es muy probable que el agua que consumes tenga adicionado ciertos niveles de flúor y tiene el propósito de prevenir las caries, tal como enriquecen la sal con IODO para evitar el bocio endémico o le agregan folatos a las harinas para evitar el mielomeningocele. No son vacunas pero si es una forma de prevención que tienen como finalidad lo mismo. Ten en cuenta que hay vacunas que no previenen la enfermedad sino la posilbilidad de que ocurra una enfermedad grave y diseminada como es la BCG - vacuna antituberculosa-.<br>  El tratamiento para la mayoría de los estreptococos es la penicilina y también lo es para el Streptococcus mutans pero esta no tendría acción en el esmalte dental ya que la medicación se transporta con la sangre y el esmalte no se nutre de ella. Para esto, la placa bacteriana -en la cual esta el Streptococcus mutans pero también hay muchas otras  bacterias- existe otro tipo de tratamiento que es el cepillado con medicación específica y barrido de los gérmenes con sus cerdas. Si a esto le agregamos el hilo dental y el enjuague...:?Donde están las caries? El problema de las caries como en otros muchos problemas es la educación. LAVARSE LOS DIENTES regularmente.

SDHvDNGJaa	Como te comentaba mi querida amiga en tu pregunta anterior, el pa?o en el embarazo forma parte del proceso de destoxificación que el organismo realiza durante este periodo. Porque dentro de los órganos que permiten la eliminación de desechos que inclusive pueden ser da?inos para nuestro organismo, se encuentran el hígado, el ri?ón y la piel. Cuando te encuentras en un estado de intoxicación fuerte, el cual puede tener diversas causas, desde un estre?imiento, hasta una intoxicación mayor, se puede reflejar en tu piel en forma de pa?o. También el pa?o puede ser simplemente una respuesta a una sobre-exposición al sol. Si alguien tiene un problema así, que no se deba a embarazo o a una sobreexposición al sol, debería darse una vuelta por el médico para que el encuentre la causa de ese pa?o.|`|462410aca33c137f7676b925b3385428aa	yo le haría caso a la Dra.

SDHvDNGJaa	Son microorganismos extraídos de la leche que tienen efectos benéficos en el sistema digestivo, pues estimulan el crecimiento de bacterias en el colon, que contrarrestan enfermedades, porque son bacterias comensales que compiten por nutrientes con las bacterias patógenas que pueden llegar al organismo. Dentro de las bacterias patógenas con las que compiten se encuentran Salmonella y Escherichia coli.<br>  Los probióticos son microorganismos extraídos de la leche con importantes efectos fisiológicos, que al ser ingeridos de manera suficiente, potencian el sistema inmunológico, dado que estimulan el crecimiento de bifidobacterias y lactobacilos en el colon, que protegen el sistema digestivo.<br>  Esa protección puede ir desde eliminar el estre?imiento o los cólicos, hasta prevenir infecciones gastrointestinales y reforzar las defensas del organismo.<br>  Recientes estudios encabezados por Eyal Raz, de la Universidad de California, encontraron que estos microorganismos son capaces de contrarrestar enfermedades como la de Crohn y la colitis ulcerosa.<br>  Otra investigación, realizada en Finlandia con 571 ni?os de guardería, comprobó que los infantes que consumieron probióticos sufrieron menos infecciones respiratorias.<br>  Saludos!|`|yeKMM089aa	Son bacterias residentes que forman colonias en el tracto gastrointestinal, vaginal y en la boca . Estas bacterias “amistosas” como el Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis son la primera línea de defensa  de nuestro cuerpo contra los microorganismos potencialmente da?inos que se inhalan o ingieren.<br>  Probiótico palabra de origen griego que significa "a favor de la vida” es el término utilizado para estas bacterias amistosas que viven y conviven todos los días de nuestra vida en nuestro tracto gastrointestinal trabajando en simbiosis con nuestro cuerpo.<br>  Pensemos  en ellos como el "guardián de nuestro cuerpo", un ejército bacteriano que nos defiende contra los tan peligrosos invasores.<br>  Si poseemos un gran número de estas bacterias residentes nos ayudarán a prevenir una amplia gama de enfermedades.
FdyHlD7eaa	Hola ,Somos la planta más importante del planeta, y como tal, necesitamos estar colmados de agua permanentemente, pues si comenzamos a secarnos, comenzamos a envejecer y enfermar. El cuerpo humano, casi en sus tres cuartas partes es agua, y esta se encuentra en distribuida en tres grandes depósitos. Un deposito esta en el interior de las células, permitiendo que cada una de ellas pueda vivir. Otro deposito esta formando un mar donde flotan las células y las mismas se protegen. El tercer deposito forma el plasma sanguíneo o suero, por donde navegan los nutrientes. Teniendo presente que los tres litros de sangre de un cuerpo adulto, son constantemente filtrados por los ri?ones, podemos decir que de los 170 litros que filtran en un día, 169 vuelven al torrente sanguíneo, eliminando el litro restante por la orina. Otro litro se pierde a trabes del sudor, la materia fetal y la respiración.<br>  Si por ultimo consideramos, que nuestro organismo esta preparado para sobrevivir durante varias semanas sin ingerir alimentos, pero en solo algunos días, se extingue,  sin la ingesta de agua. Se deduce de lo expuesto, la importancia que tiene para mantener nuestro cuerpo saludable, el mantener en su nivel y calidad, el caudal de agua en nuestro cuerpo.<br>  Este nivel se mantiene, primero por la ingesta del litro y medio como mínimo, que debemos tomar en forma diaria. Cabe destacar, que hablamos de agua, no de líquido, es decir, que aparte del líquido que podamos tomar, hay que agregar la toma del agua.<br>  Otra forma de incorporar agua es a trabes de nuestros alimentos. Por ejemplo las verduras de hoja contienen una cantidad de agua elevada, y en general todos los vegetales contienen agua en su composición. Todo lo expuesto nos lleva a la conclusión que, en el jardín de nuestra vida, no hay planta más importante para regar, que nuestro propio cuerpo.<br>  Cuidémoslo, no es tan difícil. a tomar agua amiga saludos y besitos espero haberte ayudado|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Porque el agua es el medio en el que suceden todas tus funciones vitales, entonces tomar agua ayuda a que tu organismo funcione perfectamente, como relojito!|`|tB4yoEjXaa	a matar la sed..|`|NJQQDBsOaa	una de tantas funciones, la detoxificacion del organismo. para la sangre, regulacion de la temperatura corporal, metabolismo, etc.<br>  suerte|`|RJKUjgUqaa	EL AGUA MANTIENE VIVA A TUS CELULAS ADEMAS DE QUITAR LOS DESECHOS DE TU ORGANISMO.ETC|`|YtOODHHLaa	Es muy importante porque ya que es una partícula muy peque?a puede atravesar fácilmente células y membranas y de esta manera ayuda a transportar los diferentes nutrientes a todo el organismo, además la mayoría de sustancias se disuelven en el agua, por lo que es conocida como el disolvente universal, también ayuda en la digestión de los alimentos en el intestino delgado (absorción nutrientes), mantiene el equilibrio entre el LIC (líquido intracelular) y LEC (líquido extracelular) y además regula la temperatura corporal.

Algunas de las causas de la uveítis pueden ser trastornos autoinmunitarios, infección o exposición a toxinas, pero en muchos casos, la causa sigue siendo desconocida.<br>  <br>  La forma más común de uveítis es la uveítis anterior, la cual implica la inflamación de la parte frontal del ojo. Esta forma de uveítis generalmente se limita al iris, por lo tanto, con frecuencia la afección se denomina iritis (inflamación del iris). La inflamación puede estar asociada con enfermedades autoinmunitarias como la artritis reumatoidea o la espondilitis anquilosante, pero en la mayoría de los casos se presenta en personas sanas y no indica ninguna enfermedad subyacente. Este trastorno puede afectar únicamente a un ojo y es más común en las personas jóvenes y de mediana edad. Los antecedentes de enfermedades autoinmunitarias son un factor de riesgo.<br>  Hay que ponerse en manos de un oftalmólogo. Te recomiendo que consultes varios expertos en el área para que descartes cualquier diagnóstico equivocado y que sigas todas sus recomendaciones.<br>  Suerte y saludos...|`|22b95862e79606f0f5855b29725fb2feaa	Amiga, desconozco de que se trate eso, pero los corticoides si tienen efectos negativos a largo plazo si se abusa de ellos, mantén el control médico y espero que alguien te dé una respuesta, saludos y cuídate mucho???<br>  un abrazo?? =)|`|Eik1LW02aa	Hola Aguaclara<br>  No se mucho sobre el tema, esta bien que te informes y te ocupes, ponete en buenas manos y trata de traquilizarte.

AA12237913	I know the feeling... it's not just mental, but also physical, since eating makes your body release endorphins and makes you feel good. <br>  <br>  What you need to do is not think about it and find something to keep busy. Having a friend is often good. Going out, shopping, playing sports, walking, or going to a museum or anything to stay away from the kitchen.<br>  <br>  Another way is finding a hobby. When you're absorbed in the hobby, you don't have time to think about food.<br>  <br>  Good luck. You can do it, only if you want it badly enough.

Do a modified pushup  with your hand close together...this really blast them.  Or put two chairs about 2 feet apart. Sit on one and put your feet on the other. place your hands on the edge of the seat and slide your butt off. Lower your body down and back up.This is a reverse push up and it really hit the triceps too.|`|NCuNqALnaa	Try doing push ups at night, about 25 reps should help.

Only arms or full body?<br>  <br>  If you're doing only arms every other day part of your problem is that you aren't allowing your muscles to heal.

The more you're Core is strong the more your arms will have the capability to be strong.<br>  <br>  Lift all major muscle groups every week and try to take safe supplements that you have researched.<br>  <br>  When I'm on mass building stages I take:<br>  Protein<br>  Creatine Monohydrate<br>  N.O.

Instead of doing 3 sets of 10 at 60 pounds (example) do 3 sets of 3 at 100 pounds and be explosive in your motion. On the last rep, let the weight down very slowly. Doing both these things will maximize the SIZE of your arms as well as your core strength because it tears more muscle and calls more muscle cells into action - in fact the very ones that have more capacity fro growth. (these are your "fast-twitch" muscle cells)<br>  <br>  Another thing you can do is eat a bit of protein right before going to bed. A couple eggs or a 1/2 cup of cottage cheese. This will help you from losing too much protein during sleep and help repair your muscles overnight.|`|AA12133668	from past experience, chicken and tuna are what i eat on a daily basis. packed full of protein and energy, these foods will help immensely. i have never believed in all the powders and shakes. with the right diet none of that crap is needed....as far as exercises...you could try 21's..i get a really good burn doing those...others include concentration curls, preacher curls,  forward and reverse cable pulldowns, hammer curls...i started lifting 3 yrs ago...my biceps started at 12'', now i am up to 18". the main thing to realize is it takes time, unless you take the easy way out and cheat. good luck!

Estos quistes aunque en su mayoría pueden ser benignos y no peligrosos como el cáncer, pueden afectar la producción hormonal de tus ovarios. Para controlar estas alteraciones tu ginecólogo (a)  tiene que hacerte una valoración y determinar qué sustitutos hormonales recomendarte, que no induzcan el crecimiento de tus quistes y su transformación en "malignos".  Los cambios hormonales que producen esos quistes en tus ovarios pueden estar afectando tu lubricación. Esa la puedes auxiliar usando lubricantes vaginales, para evitar otro tipo de da?os y no favorecer infecciones, que pueden afectarte a otro nivel tu aparato reproductivo. Debes de ponerte en manos de un buen médico al que le tengas mucha confianza.

AA12350891	There is a very small amount of trans fat that occurs naturally, and may be benificial. To understand why the 'manufactured' ones are bad and the natural ones are good would take a long and complicated biochemical analysis of triacylglyceride structures. In short, the body knows how to handle the natural ones while the manufactured ones (not found in nature) cannot be used or broken down properly by the bodies enzymes.<br>  <br>  "What about dairy?<br>  Dairy foods and milk contain a small amount of naturally occurring trans fat. The amount is less than the FDA labeling threshold of 0.5 grams per serving, therefore most dairy foods will be labeled as 0% trans fat.

CLA, a type of trans fatty acid found in dairy has been shown to contain cancer-inhibiting properties.

It is all a marketing strategy to make the product appear more perfect in the package and cut easier, etc.

If it was high then they would've done more extensive testing to find the source. Sometimes in the ER we see psych patients who come in with symptoms that could lead someone to believe it's simply mental, however, certain viruses and bacterias can also manifest into these symptoms (confusion, anxiety, increased heart rate). It's always better to err on the side of caution.|`|EhxloVKvaa	high white blood cell count is just the first step  just to find out if there is a infection   doctors like to jump the gun<br>  as far as anxiety most of the time heavy breathing causes the attack  and then it get worse due to a chain reaction<br>  slow deap breaths are the best thing to due when having an attack|`|39b06543beec79339a7cd93173bd16aeaa	Perhaps the nurse was neurotic?

Maybe the blood test was for lots of different things just to rule out and white blood cell was on of several things on the test and was the only one that the nurse mentioned.<br>  Your father should try and get to the bottom of what caused his anxiety and panic attack. Often it can be related to rebound from excess drinking, job stress, family stress, financial worries, adverse reactions from medications or withdrawal reactions from stopping medications too quickly. Night time sleeping pills can cause day time withdrawal effects. Perhaps your father has a long history of anxiety problems and if so he should consider getting cognitive behavioural therapy. Xanax is very addictive by the way, if I were your father I would try to avoid relying on tranquillisers for anxiety symptoms, certainly not long term. People can become hooked after only a few weeks of use of tranquillisers.|`|AA11604736	i m not a doc, but i think the docs are trying to check the cause of the anxiety attack. is it a sudden loss of oxygen in the blood?? white blood cells are supposed to protect the blood from antigens. a lack of these would give a patient the same sympotms that ur father is experiencing. <br>  <br>  they may just be taking the samples to over rule the possiblity of an internal hemorrage or infection. <br>  <br>  i hope your father gets well soon.

If the skin is still red after not drinking for a week, it will in all probability remain red.|`|7zwBswgEaa	...or it may have little to do with alcohol. It may be rosacea. <br>  <br>  Below is an article I wrote on rosacea. <br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes<br>  <br>  Hannah<br>  <br>  <br>  How to recognize rosacea? Can you cure it, or at least control it? Will it always be like this, will it get better on its own? Why do I have it?  The short answer is that nobody knows why rosacea appears and how to cure it, but at least it is possible to control this distressful skin affliction.<br>  <br>  Rosacea is a chronic skin disorder that affects more than ten million Americans, with almost half of the sufferers aged between 30 and 50 years old. The disease has been called “the Celtic curse” because it affects more often people of Northern European descent.  Women are more likely to suffer rosacea of the milder form, and men more frequently have the severe form, which involves deformity of the nose. Rosacea nearly always appears on sun damaged skin. <br>  <br>  Except for cases precipitated by use of steroids, the causes of rosacea are not known, but there are several discredited theories, including those involving skin mites (Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis), and the bacterium Helicobacter pylori.  Because we do not know what causes the disease, there are no good treatment and all that can be done is to prevent irritation and inflammation.<br>  <br>  Rosacea develops in stages and is characterized by "twitchy" blood vessels, i.e., subcutaneous blood vessels that are too sensitive. Almost anything will start flushing and blushing episodes followed by redness of the skin caused by congestion of the capillaries and chronic dilation of capillaries causing elevated dark red blotches on the skin. Rosacea patients may develop severe sebaceous gland growth that is accompanied by papules, pustules, cysts, and nodules. Inflammatory lesions develop in the areas of erythema and may look like acne, but in rosacea there are no comedones, the primary event in acne.<br>  <br>  It can be difficult to distinguish acne, eczema, and other skin affections from rosacea, but it is very important to recognize rosacea because, although it cannot be cured right now, early recognition and treatment can prevent progression to disfigurement.<br>  <br>  There are several medical treatments used to attenuate the effects of rosacea rather than cure it, and laser treatment can help with telangiectasia or deformation of the nose.<br>  <br>  Azelaic acid is effective in the treatment of rosacea, particularly at the stage when there are papules and pustules. Glycolic acid is beneficial for all stages of rosacea, both in the higher concentrations of glycolic peels used by professionals, and at the lower concentrations for home use (3-10%). <br>  <br>  It is important to avoid precipitating factors such as sun exposure, stress, cold weather, hot beverages, cigarette smoke, alcohol consumption, and any foods that you noticed exacerbate your rosacea. Any cosmetics used must be non-comedogenic and nonirritating; use sunblock and avoid sun exposure, because sun damage is one of the factors that precipitate rosacea.<br>  <br>  Skin Actives Scientific sells soothing extracts (licorice) and anti-inflammatory ingredients known to help with rosacea (niacinamide). Centella asiatica, and horse chestnut extracts are well known for their capillary strengthening properties. Our clients have reported excellent results with sea kelp bioferment used on its own (please see our forum). Other actives worth trying are magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, green tea caffeine (would work as a vasoconstrictor).<br>  <br>  Skin Actives Scientific sells epidermal growth factor BT (EGF), whose vasoconstricting activity on blood vessels can alleviate rosacea symptoms in a few days (patent pending). <br>  <br>  Good news! Skin Actives Scientific is now selling its new, patent pending Rosacea Control Serum with EGF. Take advantage of this opportunity to try a new approach to rosacea control, which has already alleviated rosacea symptoms in many of our clients.<br>  <br>  More good news: Skin Actives Scientific has another patent pending product that helps with rosacea: Celestite spritz helps prevent the skin reaction to sudden changes in temperature.

They are greatly influenced by the media nowadays, telling you what body shape is perfect and stuff. That's why people start comparing themselves with these 'perfect figures' and most of the time, they end up thinking that they're fat. But in actual fact, they're not fat. Or even if they are, the most important thing is to be healthy. Who cares about being fat or skinny?
SDHvDNGJaa	Si se puede detectar, sobre todo si el tumor es grande y consolidado. Yo diría eque en vez de visitar a un quiropráctico deberías de ir con un ortopedista o un neurólogo.

AA12237913	No, it does not matter whether you're endomorph, mesomorph or ectomorph, but your overall weight and activity level.<br>  <br>  These are just general descriptions of body types and only use them losely. They are not very good descriptors of body types and everybody is so different.<br>  <br>  An active endomorph at 6' will need a lot more calories than a sedintary endomorph a 5'. It doesn't matter your body type, a 6' active person, will need a lot calories, and vice versa for someone who is sedintary. I do not recommend you put too much emphasis on this body type classification. It's very general and many doctors do not learn know about it.
iRnkEYmwaa	Protect it from what, may I ask? Overuse?<br>  <br>  Well, you probably could avoid overuse by not using your voice too much!<br>  <br>  If that's not possible because you're a speaker or a singer, avoid yelling or cheering.  Make sure you're projecting your sound from your diaphragm, not straining your vocal cords for volume.  A singer should know how to do that, as well as how to use warm up exercises before belting out a note that's stretching your vocal range.<br>  <br>  Another tip is to avoid dairy products, as milk, ice cream, etc can contribute to excess mucous in your nose and throat.<br>  <br>  If you're worried about losing your voice from something like a virus or laryngitis, I'd recommend boosting your immune system as a preventative measure.  Eat plenty of antioxidant and vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables, drink lots of water, keep your diet balanced.  You can also take an herbal supplement that includes echinacea for that purpose.|`|drpkI4Lkaa	Shut-up!|`|sA1C64x4aa	Don't smoke. Try not to get sick. Don't yell or scream. Salt water gargle.

yYujYJFZaa	Complications are unexpected problems that can occur during or after the procedure. Most women are not affected. The main possible complications of any surgery are bleeding, wound infection or an unexpected reaction to the anaesthetic.<br>  <br>  Complications that are specific to a hysterectomy include a urine infection or accidental damage to other organs and tissues in the abdomen. <br>  <br>  After pelvic surgery it is also possible to develop a blood clot, usually in a vein in the leg (deep vein thrombosis). Women having a hysterectomy are given preventative treatments such as "graduated" support stockings to help maintain the blood flow in the veins of the legs during and after the procedure. <br>  <br>  The chance of complications depends on the exact procedure and other factors such as the woman's general health. The surgeon will be able to explain how the risks apply individually
