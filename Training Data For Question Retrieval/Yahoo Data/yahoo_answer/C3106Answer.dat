AA10250756	No one can help you if we don't know what kind of work you do. If you are in the health field, there are lots of jobs. If you are in construction there are none. That leaves a lot in between.
22bd9613eedea26987eff70fd9d04b95aa	This question got me thinking so I asked my friend in the HR department where I work.  Below is her response.  She really knows the laws so I would say this is the case.    Hi, Manny!    I'm sorry for the bad news - they can force her take holidays and/or vacation (aka Paid Time Off or PTO) according to business needs (i.e., whenever they want).  It's definitely legal.  They can also force her to take days off as unpaid if they institute a furlough for their workforce.    Hope this "helps".  Sorry it's not the answer you wanted.|`|JdGOsdXtaa	He is something that is even more simple to get her to understand. Take the time off that is owed to you and advised by her boss or she  may not have a job. When there is no buisness coming in and they still have to pay employees then this is considered a loss of profit. Most if not all companies have a separate account they use to deposit funds in to pay for  benefits thru out the year to their employees.
zfueTHk2aa	A single pay cycle, also known as a pay period to some, is not the only issue.    My question to you is if you set up the account using a voided check. If you didn't, then your direct deposit is yet to be confirmed. If you did, then there's a chance the information was entered wrong. I would go to your bank and get a copy of all transactions since you set up your direct deposit. Bring this to your manager/boss/payroll department and show them that the pay was never received. Have him/her/them check your direct deposit information against what you know it to be. If there's an error, they can void out the last payment, change your deposit information, and issue you a new one (usually this process takes about 3-4 days though).    However, as the first response states, some places require a full pay cycle (the period in which your time is calculated for pay) to be worked through without direct deposit. Generally, these companies will pay you in a check, attainable at the office or through the mail depending on where their payroll is handled.    Hope that helps you figure out where you cash escaped to ^_^|`|Nkwv2hygaa	It takes a pay cycle for it to fully activate.|`|JdGOsdXtaa	Figure 1-2 pay cycles until then you should be receiving a live check.

Box, then you can have stuff delivered there, pick up your slip, wait in line between the set hours and pick up your package.

fvre0o9laa	You might try Connie Crawford's Studio Sewing Secrets DVD -- it's meant for beginning or returning home sewing enthusiasts, and starts with threading the machine and progresses through a blouse, with extras like zipper applications, etc.   I've just had a pair of almost 10 year olds work through it... they got stuck in a couple of places and needed a little bit of help, but they both did a good job, and are now coming to me for some more advanced work.  http://www.butterick.com/item/CC770.htm?...  (I'd suggest you might also want the student packet that goes with it):  http://www.butterick.com/item/CC771.htm?...    On the other hand, if you can get some basic sewing lessons locally, it can be a big help, especially for things like checking that your pattern is properly laid out on the fabric for cutting, and that you're cutting accurately.

FhyYpuiUaa	They will need copies of your utility bills, especially past-due bills.  The energy assisstance workers will need to check your resources and income, so have verifications of this information.  You need to know how you heat your home (kerosine? gas?).      In Virginia, if you are over a certain income limit based on your household size, you will be denied assisstance.  So, it depends on wages, resources, household size, etc.    If you go to your social services department, they will give you an application to fill out.  Also, ask for the name and number of a senior worker who knows their stuff about energy assisstance who could possibly help you with your application.    This website looks like it will help you greatly.  http://www.liheapillinois.com/|`|QCkanmR9aa	call 311 they will help you asap i just seen on chanel p midday news they have million's of dollars left for this winter.
