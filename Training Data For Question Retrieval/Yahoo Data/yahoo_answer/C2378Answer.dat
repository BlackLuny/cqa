Colleges love to see that you stay with one or two extra curricular activities throughout all of high school which you have done with news paper. if you continue the tutoring for the rest of high school it is good. Colleges don't like people being in like 10 clubs going to 10 different places for community service. they like you to stick with one or two things. Just make sure that you have a leadership role in one of your clubs or some aspect that is school-related (etc. not captain of basketball team in summer camp) for example, if you team captain for a school sport then you should be fine.

qnDYiquFaa	THE TROUBLE WITH PLANARIA WORMS? <br>  <br>  By Majid Ali <br>  Adapted from an article which first appeared in the March 2003 edition of Ryedale Reporter Magazine, Ryedale Aquarist Society, Yorkshire, England <br>  Aquarticles<br>  <br>  On many occasions fellow aquarists have sought my advice on 'infestations of aquatic parasites' which have suddenly appeared in their aquaria. Upon further investigation these infestations have, thankfully, proved to be of a harmless planarian nature. <br>  <br>  Planarian worms are tiny, thin and milky white in appearance. They are distantly related to flukes, and some of these worms have been implicated in skin slime problems with marine fish. They are usually seen slowly gliding over the surfaces of the tank, surfaces of the glass and under the lid of box filters. <br>  <br>  These particular worms are, at times, a problem. How do they manifest? They usually become visible when:- <br>  1. An aquarist has overfed his/her fish. <br>  2. The aquarium gravel is not hoovered accordingly. <br>  3. Aquarium ammonia levels have risen. <br>  <br>  If present in small numbers Planaria can be dealt with by eliminating the above, but when larger numbers are involved they become a problem. I have tried the following methods to try to clear them:- <br>  a) I have used a variety of white spot cures, tonic salts and aquatic bacteriacides etc. without any real success. Fellow aquarists have claimed some success using Sterazin (Waterlife product), Anti-crustacean Parasite (Interpet) and Parasite Guard (Sera) but I have yet to try these particular products myself. <br>  b) Sometimes removing the fish/aquatic livestock and raising the tank temperature, for 24 hours, to 35 C can rid a tank of Planaria. <br>  c) Drastic - but strip the tank down, boil any gravel and scrub the decor clean, and leave everything to dry for a week (remembering to change any filter material). Unfortunately there is no guarantee that once the tank is re-established the problem may not quickly resume. A second strip down and washing with a bleach solution may be the answer? <br>  d) Natural predators may help. Apple Snails, Hong Kong Plecs. (coldwater), Whiptail Catfish, and any Limnivorous Catfish (Mud-eaters, e.g. Twig Catfish and Bubble-nesting Catfish, who are constantly searching throughout the tank for vegetable matter, detritus, micro-organisms and tiny crustaceans), are among the species that will (usually if left unfed for a few days) eat away at Planaria on a long term basis. In the short term Betta and Pelvicachromis (Kribs.) species will eat small amounts of Planaria. <br>  <br>  Please note that Planarian worms can get into the gills of aquatic livestock and cause irritation, leading to fish etc. becoming jumpy and starting to scratch against the decor. I have witnessed this with Axolotls, and when a friend's Red Cap Oranda was constantly rubbing against the decor with no signs of a disease infection. We ultimately discovered that an abundance of Planaria in the tank had caused this problem. <br>  <br>  As we touched on earlier, Planaria can be a problem with filtration equipment, particularly of the box and Fluval type varieties. To rid such equipment of Planaria try one of the following:- <br>  1. Strip the filter and give it a good scrub. <br>  2. Pour boiling water in and on the filter (especially through the holes). <br>  3. Immerse the filter in hot water which contains a mild solution of bleach. <br>  <br>  Warning - Research carried out by Tim Henshaw at Bolton Museum (Lancashire, U.K.) indicates that Planaria carry a toxin on their surface. This toxin is particularly potent towards any species of shrimp and glass shrimp. <br>  <br>  As Planaria are parasitic, can they harm humans who come into contact with them? As far as my research indicates there are no recorded cases, but always make sure that you wash your hands well following contact and that any cuts etc. are covered prior to work with Planarian problems. <br>  <br>  I hope you have enjoyed this article. If you can add any information, particularly on livebearing fish which may eat Planaria, please contact David (via the contact details above) who will feature any 'Feedback' in a future issue of Ryedale Reporter (mailing you a writer's copy in return), as we still have much to learn about these and many other parasites, who our 'fish friends' have to contend with in aquaria.

Nin6IawVaa	I am a public health nurse and deal with social workers all the time. It's a noble profession, but I am afraid, work hours for social workers and money is not worth the education. I know you are young and you have this excitement to help people, but you have not expereinced life yet. <br>  Things are tough outside. Last year, many social workers were laid off due to budget cut. Social workers who remained have over 100,000 case load.<br>  <br>  Education is also an investment. Plus, you will need Masters in Social work to  make decent money.<br>  <br>  <br>  To answer your question<br>  <br>  You are right. There are pros and cons to any profession. You should go in to in and find it out for your self. I shouldn't have given you my opinion. <br>  I know there are different types of social workers. It's okay...<br>  <br>  Courses in university should be pretty interesting. You will have to take some general coursework first ofcourse. After that upper division classes could be a bit harder. You will have to write a lot of papers. <br>  <br>  I hope you are right about the demand of social workers. When budget cut came in san diego county, orange county, and La county...social workers were the first one to go. May be you are right.....may be our economy will come out and they will start to hire social workers again.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
mbXHkf1maa	Put in hard work and get rich, and you can relax knowing you can't be harmed by random misfortunes (recessions, etc). Only your own effort can get you a quiet life.<br>  <br>  (I think it's using a metaphor, treating chance as a big wheel that can roll on you and crush you; but once you're solidly established, it's like chaining the wheel up so that can no longer happen. It being Emerson, this'd fit in with his usual work ethic).|`|knSyGZBoaa	Let me loosely translate it:<br>  <br>  Let's say that you have to work to acquire knowledge like usual. There is a wheel representing contingency or chance that naturally rotates like a normal, conditioned wheel will. If you live your life out of fear of knowledge, of acquisition, and you chain this wheel down so as to prevent it from turning and forcing you to work, then you are working, are you not?<br>  <br>  The only peace you can find with yourself is to inherently lock yourself up and prevent yourself from acquiring knowledge, like the straw men of T.S. Eliot's The Hollow Men.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  Quotes are certainly interpretive, and this is my interpretation. The best way to interpret something is to break it down into terms that you can understand. Considering that I do not know of the text around this quote, I cannot give you a better translation. This is only what I can derive from it.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.

9qXHUkf2aa	With that GPA, universities will probably not accept you. But you should still work as hard as you can during senior year to have a 4.0-5.0 GPA for the first semester and the second semester if it counts on the college application. <br>  <br>  After high school graduation, going to a community college, doing exceptionally well there, and transferring to a 4-year university would be a good route. While at the community college, you can take culinary classes, intern, etc. and at the university you can go to culinary school or get an MBA which will be good since you plan on a party planning business. You sound like a determined individual, but you can only make something out of your life if you work exceptionally hard. Don't figure that since high school's almost over, anything you do isn't worth it anymore.

You might want to work on your spelling and grammar before you try telling us that. I'm sorry, but by the looks of this message, I'm not surprised that you have a 1.1 GPA. Looks like its community college for you.|`|OU7RfpJJaa	well, first you have to graduate high school. Most high schools don't let you graduate unless u have at least a 2.0....so hit the books, actually DO your homework and go to summer school...definitely.]<br>  AFTER you graduate, your only option will be to go to community college. If I were you I would save that 30,000 dollars and get good grades in community college and then transfer to a university of your choice. BTW, alot of community colleges have culinary arts programs, for example, American River College in Sacramento, CA has an excellent program, the campus even has a 3 star rated (reservations only) restaurant that is entirely run by students. It might be something you want to look into.

agpCn6Kaaa	It's good that you are focused on getting good grades and want to get into a good school, but your mom also wants you to pitch in and help out in the household.  Sit down and have a talk with her, tell her how hard you are working and then ask her to give you a list of chores she wants done every day, and make the time to do them as long as she allows you enough time to do your schoolwork.  This way, she'll be happy and and won't have to nag you, and you will have guaranteed time to spend doing the schoolwork.|`|SDMqpoFXaa	It's always great to stay focused in school and excel amongst your peers. However, it's very important to balance school, friends, and family. One must have that balance amongst the three to remain happy and stress-free.<br>  <br>  If you can, have a talk with your mother about the importance that school has in your life. Compromise with her--tell her that you will get the chores done, but only once you have completed all of your schoolwork and homework assignments. This way, you won't have to worry about getting your homework done late at night but instead will be able to calm down and do your chores.<br>  <br>  Over the weekends, make sure to get your homework done ahead of time. Sometimes saving homework for Sunday can be stressful because of the fact that you are trying to cram all of the work that you have to do into one day. Do some of it on Friday, this way you will have a majority of it out of the way that you won't have to do on Sunday. Also, if you complete some of it on Friday, you can go back to the school and get any notebooks that you may have forgotten.

Haha! My suggestion would be to just remain on your best behavior in that class and don't let her see your phone again. If others really do have their phones out, they'll probably get caught and have them confiscated as well. And if the teacher keeps giving you trouble, even if you're paying attention and showing her that you're trying to learn (and not trying to text or whatever she suspects) then you could always go to a counselor or something and let them know that the teacher might be treating you unfairly.|`|xEbclhhEaa	Um maybe tell the administrators? Everyone keeps their phones, but the phone policy is really stupid in my opinion.<br>  <br>  If it fell out, and she says something else they'll believe her cuz shes the teacher....which is dumb but thats how it looks. She must have something against you. Write down the offense everytime she calls you out and if you're able to...try and videotape the kids doing it in front of her and her not doing anything. There are just bitchy teachers in the world that play favorites. Not much you can do.
Sz5awVnRaa	To be honest, you won't need either of them to get an EMT-B certification because i;m an certified first responder and plan on taking my EMT training during the summer. The class is designed so that anyone without any medical background can become an EMT. so they basically teach you everything. One thing though, the class is kind of hard and you have to work really hard. I heard it had a high dropout rate, but good luck:)
h0ypk4Dtaa	Medical school is a big commitment, but like anything, it is what you make it. It has taken a lot of energy and devotion, but it has been well worth it for me. It's a great thing to take the broken body and use your mind and hands to help to restore it.<br>  For the first two years of medical school, you will be taking the basic sciences but at master's degree levels. The final two years you work in the hospitals and clinics to gain experience and detailed knowledge about the specialties. During the first two years, I woke up at 6 am, studied for an hour, then went to class from 8-12. Labs were 3-4 times a week from 1-4pm. Then I would study from 5-8 pm. It sounds like a lot, but you are studying interesting subjects and you will learn to make time to play. I still went to the gym 4 times a week, slept in on the weekends, and had a garden with my wife.<br>  Talk to a medical school near to you and find out about shadowing a physician to see what it is like. You need to think about taking your pre-requisites, too. Bio, gen chem, organic chem, and physics. Keep your grades up and do well on the MCAT. That will get your application on the committee desks. Then you need to have something that sets you apart, so keep your hobbies and get involved in community service. The admission committees want to see that you area a community-minded, well-rounded person who will make a positive impact on the healthcare community.<br>  Good luck and you can do it!

TrJqwSWpaa	There is still much to be determined regarding this plan. Here is what we do know:<br>  <br>  1- It is not final. It will not be finalized for some time and when it does it will likely be changed at least in some way.<br>  <br>  2- Obama's plan does not specifically target Sallie Mae. Sallie Mae happens to be the nation's loan leader. <br>  <br>  3- Obama's plan to is not to eliminate federal funding. It is actually looking to increase it. Currently, when you apply for federal funding the loan is executed via a private lender such as Sallie Mae. They lend their own money and collect interest. They also provide all of the customer service and collections. The federal government simply guarantees these funds in the event of a default. AkA- even if you default Sallie Mae gets paid.<br>  President Obama's new plan calls for a conversion to "direct lending". Basically, you apply for federal funds and the government then dispurses these funds from the treasury and cuts out the middle man (Sallie Mae). It stands to save our Country over 50 billion dollars and would be the 2nd largest savings made by the Obama administration.<br>  <br>  4- The new plan also dictates that the loan's customer service and collections will be "competitvley bid". Sallie Mae is essentially the only company with the infastructure in place to perform this type of service and will in all likelyhood win the bid.<br>  <br>  5- Sallie Mae not only does FFELP (federal) loans, they also issue private loans. This line of business will not be impacted.<br>  <br>  Long story short- Sallie Mae is not going anywhere. Their business model may change in some capacity...but they are here to stay. Students will not be very effected by this change in all honesty. It is more if a beurocratic change than anything else. Best of luck in your studies :)|`|4d6c3d0b31cdd0d3e713e6f283397254aa	wow i hope so i still owe them 4,000 dollars
ApG0DpzXaa	The best way to expand your vocabulary is to hear the words in use.  Hearing them in context makes you learn the word in the way your brain is wired to learn them.  <br>  <br>  I recommend that you explore your radio dial and find your local National Public Radio station, not the public radio with the classical music all the time, the other one which is intellectual talk radio.  Listen to that instead of music, you'll be well informed on the national and international news and your vocabulary will expand.|`|eFQXl7uyaa	Go to this website: <a href="http://wordsmith.org" rel="nofollow">http://wordsmith.org</a><br>  Sign up for a word a day and practice using the word until you own it.

It's the more selective private schools (and a few state universities) that tend to look beyond grades and test scores.|`|AA10237518	Absolutely, I think extra curriculars would help, but if you have excellent GPA from excellent high school and excellent SAT, then you will most likely get into U of Illinois.|`|AtwxEl9Jaa	Your extra-curricular activities probably aren't going to be the deciding factor in whether or not you get admitted. I don't personally know much about the University of Illinois, but colleges in general are more interested in your grades and your essay. The fact that you're involved in other things besides academics is the main thing they're looking for. Obviously leadership positions are a plus, and a great extra-curricular record could bring you up if your grades were less than stellar, but I wouldn't focus on improving that right now. It sounds like you make good grades, and you're going to start taking a bunch of APs, so you'll need to work on keeping that up. Work on your writing skills, your essay can and may very well be the deciding factor in whether or not you get accepted somewhere. Try and do well on the SAT and/or ACT when you take that (them). But don't worry too much about your extra-curriculars, that fact that you stuck with them and were involved in other things besides academics will be enough. Good luck!

If you really have been trying in chemistry and just aren't getting it, then maybe you should pursue a career in another field. Maybe pharmacy isn't for you. <br>  <br>  When I finally realized that nursing wasn't the path that I wanted to take, I started thinking about what else interested me. I began to research other careers and really think hard about what I'm good at. Now I'm thinking about going into psychology, education or social work.  I know that I have strengths in all of these areas.<br>  <br>  Start looking into your other interests, dig around a little, and you just might find something else that you will like even more than pharmacy. If you are still really interested in pharmacy and want to give it a shot, then go for it. Be completely devoted to it, and if it doesn't work out, then try something else.<br>  Hope this helps, good luck!

6eHaYsOUaa	San diego state, Cal Poly SLO, and UCSD were 3 of the schools i chose between last year and i went to Cal Poly (i love it) for a couple reasons. I would rank the campuses like this:<br>  <br>  Toughest to get into and best education: 1. UCSD, 2. Cal Poly and Washington, 3. sdsu, 4. sfsu<br>  <br>  College experience (social life and things going on): I don't know much about the social life of washington or sf state, but UCSD is probably the most boring in terms of stuff to do. So its a tough decision, if you want more than a good education, i'd take a look into Cal Poly SLO personally.

Most of them last 10 days, and a couple are only 5 days (but a lot cheaper.) They have a medicine and health care program, forensic science, journalism, law, international business (in Switzerland,) and some other ones too. They all sound really interesting. I wish I would have gone when I had the chance. Its a little expensive (about 2500 for the 10 day ones and 1500 for the 5 day ones,) but you should check it out. <br>  Here's their website: www.nslcleaders.org <br>  Hope this helps, have an awesome summer!|`|SnpP6dGFaa	Girl - you don't need to study for the SAT's .

2SSD6BP9aa	I'm still in high school but I have friends who are freshmen in colleges.<br>  <br>  It varies depending on where you go and what the dorms are like.  If they are all male dorms then guys walk around in their underwear in the halls and common areas all the time.  In co-ed dorms or co-ed floors it doesn't happen so much.<br>  <br>  Most older dorms - where the freshmen are always put - have group showers on each floor.  Those dorms are usually segregated by sex.  Maybe not the whole dorm building, but there are usually male floors and female floors at least.  Though it might be co-ed if there are separate men's showers and women's showers.<br>  <br>  Newer dorms usually have more privacy, like separate shower booths.  And they are always set up to be co-ed, with separate facilities for guys and girls on each floor or even separate bathrooms shared between suites of dorm rooms.  These newer dorms are usually grabbed by upperclassmen, so they are tougher for freshmen to get into.<br>  <br>  Within your own dorm room you can be as free as you want - depending on what your roommate is ok with.  Lots of guys these days were raised never having to be naked in front of other guys.  They never used public changing rooms and they were never made to shower after gym or sports in school.  So they are pretty prudish about the whole nudity thing when they get to college, and they might not appreciate you being too open in the dorm room.<br>  <br>  Seems pretty stupid to me, but my friends say theres lots of guys at college like this.  They even shower in their underwear so no one can see them naked!  And a lot of them seem to think that any guys who are comfortable with nudity must be gay.|`|AA12021966	This is generally my experience in my dorm:<br>  - It's not so private that you can do stuff like walk around in underwear. You will need at least a towel to go to the shower and stuff. Most dorms will at least have a changing stall right outside of the shower.<br>  <br>  -There are no group showers.<br>  <br>  -Dorms tend to be co-ed (unless you opt for a dorm solely for women or men), so keep that in mind with what you do in the hallway and public areas.<br>  <br>  -Think of a dorm is a community<br>  <br>  -I can guarantee you that you'll at least have a double (you and one roommate) as a freshman.<br>  <br>  -I don't live in an area of my college where drinking occurs, but most dorms have lots of it (so beware of potheads, even if they're nice potheads).|`|8jl1tMiPaa	The appearance of the dorm will always depend on your college (you can probably get a brief description on their website).<br>  <br>  If you have a roommate, it is not going to be very private.  Guys are usually pretty open about walking around in their underwear in front of other guys, but for the most part, when you are in college, you will want as much privacy as possible -- you can change in the shower, bathroom stall, your room.  I walked from the bathroom to my room in a towel on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  Living in a dorm is a decent experience... but you will have limited space and it will probably be loud.|`|SnpP6dGFaa	Haha - you could walk around in your underwear but I wouldn't suggest it - ESPECIALLY if you're a girl...they're a pervs everywhere at college.  And dorms are not private at all.  You are usually in a room with at least one other person sometimes as many as two or three.  And then it's quite cramped and there are so many people in other rooms so close to you.  The privacy is limited and you have to deal with party people coming in at 3am and puking and being loud....it's hard to adjust to|`|09ed7150ac18474c23f9f24155554927aa	it depends on the dorm.. usually you will have crappier dorms as a freshman then have superiority as a senior.. but dorms can be anything from tiny rooms with a communal bathroom to apartment like.. you should go to the schools website you are interested in and look up their housing

Obviously the book also satirizes many things (not least other writers who criticized Voltaire) but this is the general point I think Voltaire is trying to make. The idea that evil and misfortune are natural and unavoidable parts of life is of course the idea leading up to this main point. So, does any of that help?

o3Jpfflgaa	Dreams are sometimes the result of waking stimuli or deeply-seated fears.  Sometimes, a dream can result from a traumatic event (like former combat soldiers who dream about being in battle).<br>  <br>  However, in most cases, dreams are simply random functions of the brain and are not really meaningful.  Something might have happened to you earlier in life that made an impression and now your brain happens to expand on that memory.<br>  <br>  Many people dream about finding themselves in public with very few clothes on, but that doesn't mean it ever happened.  Perhaps a fear has caused this.  I wouldn't be concerned.

So being they have to get there degree, have to take medical review boards and obtain a license to practice, treat, and prescribe medication to get patients well.|`|3TYRH1g3aa	Let's see. They all work in the same place. They look like they all wear similar uniforms. The all walk the walk and all talk the talk. How do you tell the difference between a doctor and a nurse? Their are many different aspects of each that separate the one profession from the other. At the same time, the lines are starting to blur between certain roles of the nursing profession and that of being a doctor. Being a nurse in today's world has evolved very much over the years, but still has a way to go before it can match the social status that a doctor carries with their title. Let's take a look at why this is and how nursing is transforming ever so slightly and earning some more respect in today's working environmentProbably the biggest thing that separates doctors from nurses is education. To become a doctor, you obviously have to go through many years of training and education to even get in the door, and then spend quite some time working your way up the medical ladder. Let's just say the road to becoming a doctor is a long and hard road, and justifies their status in society as an elite profession that brings home the bacon. Nursing, however, is a fairly easy profession to get into. Most technical or community colleges offer 18-24 month associates degrees that will get your career started. From there you can either begin working as an licensed practice nurse or continue on and get either a bachelors of nursing or science. The bachelor degree will earn you RN status (after passing some certification programs, or course), which make up most of the nursing professions out there. Nurses can continue to further their education in specific areas that basically put them in a same class as doctors; known as Advance Practice Nurses, they usually pick up a MBA along the way and specialize in certain types of medical care, but are well compensated for their efforts. <br>  Because of the differences in education, an obvious conclusion can be drawn regarding the duties of doctors versus nursing. As mentioned before, nurses work the "front lines" of a practice. They are the first person to interact with a patient, and are responsible for discovering the source of a patients problem, assessing the situation, and finding a solution. Many times, for non life threatening sickness or easy to treat symptoms, a doctor will not even be required and a nurse can take care of the problem. Nurses are educated to know how to perform many different tasks so as to free up time for a more specialized Doctor, who is usually focused on very technical aspects of medical care. When you think of tasks being performed by doctors, you think of surgeons in the ER, delivering babies, or even the dentist who does the actual root canal. Nurses are typically focused on preparing you to see the doctor and making sure you're doing what's right and what's healthy upon your departure. Most of the time, the doctor is running the show. It's their practice or their team, and that team usually consists of other nurses. Doctor is daddy and everyone listens to daddy, or else. However this isn't always the case. Nurses make the wheels go 'round and in some situations have authority. For example, an Advanced Practice Nurse might be in control of other nurses instead of even having an actual doctor running the show. Another scenario can arise when a doctor is visiting another hospital or possibly a section of a large hospital that is not under his direct authority. In each of these, the APN does have authority over their staff of nurses if another doctor is not in charge or present. Other than that, doctors have all the authority and have it rightfully so. They are usually the top of the ladder in the medical profession, and there are many different levels of being a doctor that each carry different levels of authority. Doctor's are the "management" staff of the hospital while nurses are the general workers. When discussing how to obtain experience in the medical field, it obviously has a lot to do with your education. There's only one way to become a doctor, and that's by going to school for many years before even stepping foot into a hospital or clinic. The opposite is true with being a nurse. With just that initial 18 month certification, you can get started as an LPN and get your feet wet. Some states offer RN programs where you can grab that bachelors of science while still working as an LPN. As you continue your career, you'll have plenty of opportunities to move up and continue your education. This is probably one area where a nurse has more experience in certain things (like dealing with different kinds of people and patients) than perhaps a doctor. Put a doctor and a nurse of the same age together, and I'll guarantee you the nurse has had more actual hands on experience at her job than the doctor has. The doc spends many years in school while the nurse was already getting their hands dirty on the job. Much like money and authority, doctors usually wie|`|ivejg4whaa	Doctors have more education and more skill.|`|Brxi3kVcaa	u don't know?<br>  <br>  Doctors treat, diagnose, per scribe<br>  <br>  nurses, care for patients monter them and do bandage changes ect|`|YAdr4Jgsaa	doctors have more responsibilities...like they have to do the major surgeries while the nurses stand by them to hand them anything they need and nurses take care of the patients before & after their surgeries and what not.|`|LegYQZMDaa	doctors operate as in operation but nurses can only support, they are not allowed to do any kind of operation.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Doctors treat and diagnose.

So beside working for school. Do you think this is possible. Your work money is what you need now. SO, of course you can't quite use your paycheck for school. It still wouldn't be enough. Yeah, try scholarship but 1 out of 40 students get scholarship that pays for most of their courses. So do pull out a student loan. It is worth it. You are investing in your future. Do not go to private school, it is too expensive. If you go to a State Uni, a year of being a full time student will cost $3,000. Get a room mate so you can minimize your payments to $300. So 12 multiply by 300 is 3,600. This is how much you will spent on a year rent. So $3,600(rent) and $3,000(school) is $6,600 per year. So when you graduate in 5 years you will have to pay about $35,000. This is average and it is not bad, because Private cost 35,00O a year. So yeah you will have to get a job to pay for gas, food, cell. And so you need to pull out a loan for $6,600 per year in the unniversity.

Focus more on the highlights of the school and why you want to go back, why it is a perfect fit for you, etc.<br>  <br>  ex: "I transferred because I thought I wanted a school that was/offered blah blah blah, but it only made me realize how perfect NEU was for me"<br>  <br>  No one cares about your depression. Sorry. You need to show them that you can balance life and classes, and stressing that point only makes you look worse. I wouldn′t even mention it at all. DO NOT tell an admissions counselor that you skip class and feel/felt no reason to go. You are pretty much asking to get rejected here.<br>  <br>  It is good that you bragged about your grades/extra curriculars while you are at NEU. Instead of saying things like "I realized I wish to transfer" Say, "I am confident that transfering back to NEU is the right step for me to acheive my goals." BE CONFIDENT. You are selling yourself here, not asking for pity.<br>  <br>  Don′t mention specific grades and what you think you can get them up to. They read your transcript. Say your grades were below your personal standards because you weren′t challenged, weren′t interested in the material... and you really regret not taking advantage of the classes that NEU has to offer, because they cater to your interests and professional/career goals. I dunno, make something up.<br>  <br>  Also, no one cares that you miss your friends, hanging out, or the neighbor′s dog. Completely irrelevant.<br>  <br>  Get someone to check your grammar because your sentence construction needs a bit of work.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.
tU5NJVL3aa	[ALL DONE]<br>  <br>  1.  A "percent grade" means that for every 100 units distance out, you drop the given number of units down, so in your example, you would have a triangle formed by the horizontal line 100 units long going straight out from your starting point and then another line dropping 42.7 units straight down. Sooo, you can use a trigonometry rule to solve for the desired angle -- sine(x) = opposite / adjacent = 42.7/100 = 0.4270... so inverse sine of that is approximately 25.28 degrees.<br>  <br>  2.  Since we know that a rhombus is an equilateral parallelogram, each side has to be 104/4, or 26 inches.  Another aspect of a rhombus is that an line BD has to bisect the line AC.  So you've got four right triangles, each with a hypotenuse of 26 and one side of 48/2, or 24 inches.  Fitting these into the Pythagorean equation <br>  a^2 = b^2 + c^2<br>  (26)(26) = (24)(24) + c^2 <br>  c^2 = (26)(26) - (24)(24)<br>  c = sqrt(676 - 576) = sqrt(100) = 10.<br>  Sooo, since we know that is 1/2 of the line bisected by AC, BD has gotta be 20 inches.|`|ZT1wBK69aa	1) Maybe you should calculate the horizontal line which is the X axis at ____degrees MINUS the above angle...<br>  Try that for size|`|qGhpsAmCaa	For number 2 subtract 104 by 48 and then there's your answer.<br>  For number 1 if the question is asking what degree does a horizontal line make then the answer would 180 degrees and i just know that off the top of my head but also if you take a look at a protractor then you'll know what I mean but other then that i'm not exactly sure as to what the answer for number 1 might be.

pe69KF3Taa	here's a complete stream of consciousness of random thoughts about this matter in no particular order:<br>   <br>  most of those events are handled by yourself as an individual. if high school teachers were to teach you the correct way to handle each individual scenario...actually they can't. as we all know, everyone is unique in their own way, thus every individual responds to these situations in a different matter. there is no universally-correct way to handle each situation...there are countless variations to each situation as well...if teachers were to teach you how to manage each of these scenarios in they "right" way, they're basically telling you how to live life. each individual will experience all of these cases at some point and will react differently to handle it according to his/her own beliefs. life isn't an entity that can be summed in an exact formula like in math class, nor can it be defined in an exact definition like in science class...there's no way to define a human life...we don't even know the meaning of life- we only have mere theory...thus there's no "right" way to live life, everyone is different thus everyone reacts differently to each situation. you know how to handle a situation from trial-and-error...you've faced these situations and responded to them many times, tweaking the response to what works for you, so you know how to handle each scenario- and you've never been taught by your high school teacher.<br>  ...however, in contrast, some schools and institutions do offer courses on efficient ways to handle some of those scenarios...such as time management classes and whatnot, but this is obviously the individual's choice to follow a conventional method.|`|yKGPbcx9aa	It would be difficult to teach all students these types of things, mostly because each person has a different view on street smarts, being emotionally strong, etcetera.

A lot of these things seem self-explanatory to me.  Is it the school's fault that one isn't genuine or that one is vain?  Seems like a personal problem to me.  They're not there to wipe your ***.  Don't blame others for your personal issues.  This seems very similar to that McDonald's case where some lady sued them for not putting "Coffee Is Hot" on their cups or whatever.  You get my point.  Not everything in life has to be spelled out for you, and quite frankly, it shouldn't be anyway.<br>  <br>  How do you propose that they teach you "how to tell a good friend from a bad friend"?  Or "how to be empathetic, they just tell you"?  What more do you want them to say?  Give you a dictionary definition?  That's all they can do - tell you to be it and hope that you have the self decency and maturity to strive for it.<br>  <br>  If it's really an issue that you must complain about, when you have a kid send them to a private school or something.  They can get all the counseling they need.  I'm sorry you didn't get the life lessons apparently you never figured out for yourself.  Yeah, your two professors went beyond their call of duty.  Even you admitted that.  It's not their job.  It's yours.  If you're going to blame someone, blame your parents or something.

I, for example learned that in life there are two different way to work (which is what you will be doing for about the next 40 years), work harder and longer to make the money to pay bills and have fun, or work smarter for more money(and then maybe you will only work 20 years), thus you dont have to work as much and you can have more fun. What i mean by work smarter is go to collage and educate yourself for a career, not a job. Any one can do a job. It takes education to have a career. I have already learned first hand that working harder sucks. Im 21 years old and my back hurts almost every day after work, my knees pop and hurt and its the same with my wrists. I cant tell you how much i wish i could go back to high school and do better then go to collage with scholarship money. i knows you have probably heard that a million times, but i did too in high school. Good Luck!!<br>  PS i just read you latest posts about your parents and......go to collage and learn Karate, or learn it some where. It teaches you how to strengthen your body, mind and spirit. Spirit being the most important. Then you will be able to protect your self from any one abusive. As far as the alcoholic, you have already learned a lesson about that. Dont become that.|`|xfQqztGRaa	High school teachers don't really have the time to teach every student life lessons. Most teachers aren't even paid that much nor will they go though the time to teach you lessons. Many of these lessons are learned from your friends, classmates, and even family. High school teachers don't have a lot of choices in teaching because they have to keep up with what the state's standards of teaching are. They have to get over a certain subject and move on. Many high school teachers don't fail students just because they want them to move on. High school is much more lenient. There are certain teachers that are there for students, but there are others that don't really care what happens. High school teachers are really just there as students, but with better benefits and having to teach the whole day. They have to grade papers, meet criteria, keep their job, etc. This is in my own opinion though.
AA10297143	Be a sponge and take everything that they throw at you.  It will make you a better person.  Be heavy in Math and Science where possible.

paOewdzzaa	It's hard, but you have to stop comparing yourself to others. In admissions, in scholarship apps, in job apps, there are often arbitrary choices made that you don't know about. It does no good to compare yourself to that guy or to anyone else. All you can do is do the best you can with what you've got. You never know, maybe something in your essay/letters will speak to admissions-types in a way that guy's did not -- or not. You can't know, and you can't worry yourself silly over stuff you have no control over. <br>  <br>  Maybe you won't be able to get into Stanford, but you still have a respectable resume, and maybe it's just not in the cards for Stanford. I'm farther along in my educational career than you are (post-doctoral), and things haven't always worked out the way that I hoped they would. But, I'm happy with the person I've become, and I feel like everything that has happened along the way was meant to -- even when it sucked at the time.<br>  <br>  If Stanford is truly your dream, hopefully you've applied elsewhere and could try to transfer later in your college career.

Because of its fame (and because it's private) it has a lot of power and doesn't have to accept anyone just because they fit the criteria or appear to be a good student. To get into Stanford, you need to be a *great* student. (AKA: wear yourself thin doing way too many activities while, at the same time, maintaining a perfect GPA and never stopping your academics even during the summer.)<br>  <br>  You can apply to Stanford, but don't get your hopes up in being accepted.

What you have to keep in mind is that all of the people applying for Stanford will be A+ students, so that isn't really much of an issue. <br>  <br>  What they are looking for is people who stand out and have potential to be movers and shakers in the world of tomorrow. That is a quality that is impossible to emulate. <br>  <br>  In other words, they will be looking at you, not your marks or your extracurricular activities. What makes you think you are Stanford material? What can you offer the university? What events in your life inspired you, made you mad enough to do something?|`|GgXtwjaZaa	I'm pretty sure Stanford had there reasons of declining the guy at your school. Give it a shot, there's nothing to lose. From my viewpoint, I think your grades are stellar, and if you don't get in (that's BS), you'll still get into a UC school at the very least. They don't always look at grades and Stanford is not known for only accepting students with a GPA of higher than a 4.0. I think you are a very diverse girl with all the extra curriculars you're involved in, and i'm sorry for saying this, but you'll do fine. Because that's the truth. Well, good luck future Stanford scholar! :)|`|qVt6wJqMaa	One of the biggest problems is that a lot of schools are not qualified for their students to go to Stanford.  The best way to get into Stanford is to go to a school for a few years, keep a perfect grade, continue to be a good student, and eventually transfer to Stanford.<br>  <br>  Apply anyway, but chances are that you won't be accepted, not because you aren't a great student, but just because the school you come from may not be qualified for it.  You're obviously responsible, so go the long route, and do it right.  You'll be in Stanford in no time!  ;D
x54JPCE0aa	Actually, contrary to popular belief, I think that it's best to learn as much as you can when you're younger. It's a fact that the older you are, the more locked in what languages you can learn gets.<br>  <br>  But, since they know their name and numbers. I would suggest going for the alphabet, the persons (yo, tu, Usted/él/y ella, &c.), everyday words and basic everyday sentences (including conjugating verbs, at first in the present form). Since you are personally tutoring, I don't see any problems with going into special interests after they're a bit more advanced (like if they like snowboarding or music, you can teach them how to talk about snowboarding or music in Spanish).<br>  <br>  Those are my suggestions =) Although I've never actually taught anyone other than helping people in maths, I hope they help.

Students can become uncomfortable when a "stranger" comes and starts teaching an already-established class.<br>  <br>  There's also the chance of increased vulnerability.  Student teachers tend to make more classroom management mistakes than those who have already been through the student teaching experience, and students are quick to pounce on anyone who seems weak.<br>  <br>  There's such a wide variety of things that could be going wrong that you'd have to look at the individual situation, but a good classroom teacher will support the students and the student teacher and help them to develop a good working relationship.|`|JwpxsMhTaa	Student teachers can be excellent or terrible... here's why:<br>  <br>  They're amazing if the mentor teacher is helpful and always behind them.

Call him/her or drop by the professor's office in person. Bring a box of chocolate or a small thank you (nothing fancy.. probably some Easter bunny stuff you can get at CVS would be OK). Your thank you visit will be a nice way of showing appreciation if the prof has already mailed out the letter (sometimes mail is slow). If he/she has not, this will be a reminder.|`|PgEb9cxPaa	great

7j9MfenOaa	If it's federal aid, it shouldn't.  I went through four and a half years of school and quit when they upped my requirements (even after I showed them the contract stating they couldn't do that after you registered).  I regrouped and totally changed my major...from music to business.  I just finished up my Associate's, and they are allowing me to get my Bachelor's in something else...and then my masters, so it shouldn't effect anything.<br>  <br>  Grants can vary from state to state...for instance, Pell is a federal grant and should not matter as they only pay so much and then they are done anyway.  But, state run grants, you may also lose early.  Loans, they will let your rack up until you finish a degree...no doubling (in other words, you can't go for two bachelors or two associates).<br>  <br>  Other than that, I don't foresee a problem...your first two years of college, as most professors will tell you, is basically when you're getting your footing and deciding who you are.  Most people change majors or career paths at least once in that time...|`|gc6uS1sMaa	Probably not if you don't change from full time student status to part time status.

k5k8ng1Kaa	1. Too much time at parties and with boys will result in getting academically dismissed.<br>  <br>  2. College is a learning environment and is very different from high school which is a teaching environment. You will need to take responsibility for learning the material and you will need to use different study strategies. Check out www.howtostudy.org<br>  <br>  3. Professors will provide you with a syllabus. Read it. Save it. They will not remind you when papers are due and that exams are coming; that was why they gave you a syllabus.<br>  <br>  4. Just because college is not required does not mean you can skip class. Go! Every time you miss you are flushing money down the toilet. <br>  <br>  5. Make yourself a weekly study schedule. You will be in class less than in high school, but for every hour you are in class, professors expect that you will be spending 2-3 hours studying on your own. So for a 3 credit class they expect you to spend at least 6-9 hours every week on it. If you don't schedule the time to study you will procrastinate and let your work pile up. <br>  <br>  6. There is plenty of time to be an excellent student and still have lots of time for fun. Study during the day (9am - 5pm) like it is your job (because it is). You will have your evenings and weekends free. <br>  <br>  7. Speaking of fun, if you choose to drink at parties, be careful. Pace yourself by consuming no more than one alcoholic beverage a hour. Alternate with non-alcoholic beverages. Avoid drinking games. It is easy to get alcohol poisoning. Avoid kegs, ice slides, and punch bowls. Diseases spread very quickly when people are doing keg stands. Watch your drink and don't accept a drink from a stranger (yes, the guy you met 5 minutes ago is a stranger). <br>  <br>  8. As for guys, be careful. Most sexual assaults happen during the first few weeks of the semester. Avoid hooking up with anyone during orientation. It happens every year and always ends badly. Even if you are on the pill use a condom. Every time. You don't want to get pregnant or get a Sexually Transmitted Infection.<br>  <br>  9. Keep an open mind. You will meet people and be exposed to ideas that you might find strange, offensive, or antithetical to you. Listen without judging. <br>  <br>  10. Make friends with your college's professors and staff members. Faculty and staff can be your mentors, supervisors, and references.|`|cZm1prgXaa	Wat|`|LJkPRqN0aa	depends, it looks as if you arent too serious about the actual academic part since you listed that LAST...... honestly in my opinion ive been going to college since 06 and havent gone to one party. im ALMOST a straight A student with the acception of 2 B's and thats all without consintrating on parties and boys....once you get your priorities straight then ask this question. because if you are just going to go for the parties and boys, youre not ready for the full effect that college can give you. tough to hear but thats life. <br>  <br>  PS: i started college a week after i graduated HS.....i have never regretted that choice.
6fpjnCMCaa	It would be better if you added what context the quote was in, but I believe it means that an envious person is only hurting themselves in their jealousy. In essence, a person who is intensely jealous of another person can destroy themselves because they may not be appreciating what they have themselves. Plus this can lead to issues of self-esteem/ a feeling of being second-best or worthless, which is not good for anyone.|`|ivejg4whaa	Being envious doesn't get you anywhere.|`|htBHCNDtaa	It means being envious will only hurt you, nobody else.

Make sure your teacher does not see you, just in case you really can't find it.

However, I think you certainly did the right thing and you might have saved yourselves.  I do wish you had reported to your teacher for the class and told her what happened.  What if some other student were lured outside.<br>  <br>  In the morning, why don't you avoid a problem by going right to the office and asking to see the principal and tell him/her what happened.  Tell the principal that you didn't think he was a teacher but weren't sure and  you were almost late for class and you weren't intending to leave the building.  Tell the principal that now  you are worried that the man might have been going to kidnap you and might do that to some other student if he wasn't a teacher.  <br>  <br>  If your friend is right and he was a teacher, then your defense is that he was not wearing a name tag and was heading for the exit. He didn't tell you anything other than to follow him.  <br>  <br>  I think you might have come close to a major problbem.<br>  <br>  If fact, after thinking about it, maybe you should tell your parents and let her call the principal at home or even call the police since you might be able to ID the guy if he was bad news.  <br>  <br>  If he was a teacher, then he should have been wearing his ID.

Don't be scared to speak up, if there's younger kids at your school this guy might be able to convince one of them (like your friend) to follow him.

At the beginning of the play (Before Duncan's murder) she is trying to convince Macbeth to commit the deed, and constantly attacking his manhood in order to manipulate him into regicide.

I thought just sounded like a great topic idea, and I'm a teacher so I would know a good topic idea. With this topic you can easily do research and put in some history which could add some "beef" to your paper. Take for instance, Korea, which we tried so hard to help liberate. Iraq, same thing. Where are all the other countries? And you might try looking into the United Nations. If I remember what I was taught when I was young it was that the United Nations is made up of tons of countries, but unlike our electoral college here in our country, each vote counts as one no matter the size. So our vote counts just as much as Cuba's vote. When you take into thought the fact that the United States funds alot for the UN, and is even the powerful hand behind it, we only get one vote?

Do not be afraid to give it.<br>  <br>  As we risk ourselves, we grow. Each new experience is a risk.<br>  We can try, and maybe fail; And, as a result, grow or hold back and stagnate.<br>   <br>  <br>  You have the potential to be anything you want.

tX4RNX1faa	Yes it is worth it! Because, every cent is paid back by your students enthusiasm that you get to teach them.

Otherwise, teaching is extremely stressful right now and not worth the low pay.|`|AA10392637	First off it depends where you live is it a growing area, and are you sure you want to teach. I would suggest you do some volunteer work in schools before making the decision.  Your major needs to be broader than K-3rd grade. In our state K-6th grade is much more common.  It is a competitive market out there. Are you willing to move from your area to teach in another state?  These are questions you need to explore before spending another $13,000 to teach. Grade school teaching jobs are easier to fill then subjects like math and science in the high school years.|`|Lr0s0gvuaa	I am not sure what area you live in, however there are teacher intern programs available.  During these programs, adults are allowed to earn their credential while they are teaching.  The programs deduct a percentage from your monthly salary (but the total you pay will be less than going 13,000)  while you are in the program, and you take classes after school and occasionally on the weekends.  After two years, you earn your preliminary credential.  <br>  <br>  In CA, there are several intern programs like this.  The requirements to joining them are:<br>  you must have a bachelor's degree.<br>  you must show mastery of whatever you want to teach (so a preapproved courseload during you bachelor's for a certain subject or the passage of specific CSET exams)<br>  and you must have a job offer.<br>  <br>  Basically (after you take required tests), you have to connect with the program itself, apply to teaching jobs, find one, then you are officially in the program.  <br>  <br>  The only catch is with the bad economy, education is facing cutbacks.  Because of budget cuts, schools have to figure out how they want to cut back: loss class size reduction and some teachers, or cut funding across the board.  Some schools are cutting small percentages of money out of all their resources because they want to make sure as many people can keep their jobs.  However, not all schools choose that.  The high school I work with will be voting on their decision next month or so.  If they choose to toss out class size reduction 2 high school teachers will lose their jobs.  And keep in mind that there are also 4 teachers retiring.  So that is a deficit of six teachers for next year.  The principal said the elementary schools will lose 12 teachers.  <br>  <br>  Basically, with the bad economy, finding a job will be difficult.  But if you do manage to snag one, an intern program is a good opportunity to check out.
Dh0JX2Onaa	No. It means that unless you improve you will probably fail.
AA11043457	You are not going to get a job as principal if you haven't been a teacher.  You also can teach and the school will likely help with tuition for the additional classes  you need.  Why don't you talk to your guidance people at college or your mentor teacher.  <br>  <br>  Counseling is a growing field but they often use psychologists as well.  <br>  <br>  You will likely have to take additional lasses of teaching methodology to teach.  You may find a preschool job, but that is not going to be real high on the list when they look for a principal. <br>  <br>  When you decided on this major, what did you intend to do?  You might want to do that.<br>  <br>  To teach or be a principal you will need more education, other than teaching preschool, which may be at the county office level.  They don't often have counselors in elementary school.<br>  <br>  I am not a teacher but used to represent teachers at their union.  I was an attorney and their labor relations representative.     Schools are cutting back on teachers so you need a couple of options as to grade subject for full employment.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Talk to  your school department head.|`|QaEeITduaa	Investigate the requirements for a teaching certificate that would get you a teaching position in a high school in your area or other areas (that is, if you can move to work in those areas). This may require you to take additional classes and do a student teaching experience. You'll need to teach for a number of years; however, before you teach too many years, check with your state dept of education once again and look to see what the requirements are for a high school administrator certificate. You'll need a masters degree in educational administration or leadership and an administration internship, which can be arranged while working full-time as a teacher in a high school. Choose to work in a system with many high schools, if possible, to maximize your chances for a position down the road. Be politically mindful as you'll want to show the school board and district office that you are flexible and able to handle any job given. Look for opportunities to be in leadership positions and when an assistant principal position comes available, apply for it. Don't turn down coordinator positions or other positions in administration (alternative school, special education - examples) as they could be stepping stones to your dream job of becoming a high school principal. By the way, it doesn't matter what teaching position you held in the high school as any teacher is eligible to become a principal if they have the pre-requisites. I've known administrators who were former shop teachers, physical education teachers, special education teachers, and so on... The main thing to remember is that your record as a teacher will be important as the teachers who have good classroom management skills and whose students achieve year after year are going to be looked upon more favorably than those who are not successful teachers. <br>  <br>  Alternative careers? Have you thought about working as a school psychologist in a high school? Marriage and family therapist with adolescents and their families? High school guidance counselor? MSW social worker? All of these careers require a masters degree, but might be a quicker road to a career than teaching and then administration degree...|`|TY1PUI2baa	In my state, you must have 5 years of successful teaching experience plus the masters in school administration.

For the most part high school students know that they will get in trouble if they let their anger get away with them. Help them figure out how to not let it get away from them, as well as educating them on the biological factors of anger (ex many are probably experiencing puberty and so there are some chemical changes going on that may make controlling anger harder) this will at least give them some understanding.

fz107eRDaa	Personally, I am a PowerScore fan. I took their LSAT class back when I was prepping and now teach there. <br>  <br>  The thing that initially made me a PowerScore fan was using the LSAT Bibles. Those books were better than the Kaplan and PR books I tried, and they were geared to a much higher intellectual level. I figured that if the books were that good, the course would be better too. When I took the class, it helped me a lot, but I'll admit up front that it was hard work. For example, there is a lot of homework in the course, and the expectation is that you will get through a lot of different materials including drills and discussions, problems sets and tests. <br>  <br>  Now that I teach there, I see the benefit of that approach, and of course law school is no picnic so asking someone to work hard in an LSAT course isn't really that unreasonable. Personally I feel that the pros of the course are the teachers (the training is lengthy) and the materials (especially some of the new stuff they have been adding to the online student center). As for cons, it is the amount of work probably, and the time commitment. <br>  <br>  I'm not very knowledgeable about the other two companies, but I've heard better things about them than Kaplan or PR. I don't think either has quite the same instructor standard as PowerScore (99th), but I know they use real questions like we do. I think you have to call each one and get a feel for whose style you like best, and ask about things like who the instructor is for your class and how large the class will be. Then go with the one you like best.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

It doesn't matter to law schools, so long as you went to a good college and did well there. <br>  <br>  So for now, focus on getting into college. While you're in college, speak to the pre-law advisor, who can give you guidance on the law school application process.|`|kUlZCbhNaa	Law school is post graduate so that mean you need a minimum 4 year undergraduate degree in any discipline.  Harvard Law School is very popular so just having a Bachelor degree will not be enough.  You will have to present a honors degree which can take more time to complete and requires high academic achievement. Not to mention a personal interview with the school.<br>  <br>  You are not over your head as long as you get into a reputable college you have a chance at making the cut for Harvard.  If you don't make the grade there are plenty of other top law schools which are equally good.|`|5EGm6ZLhaa	Well law school is a post-graduate school and thus you first need a bachelor's degree to be eligible to apply, so you have quite a few years (at least 6) yet before you even need to be worrying about law schools.

Zw5nn7cNaa	I would say yes. Carnal means "of the flesh" and carnivore is one who eats flesh. Carnival comes from the celebration when Catholics would "get rid of the meat" during lent in Italy.<br>  <br>  Chili con carne is a phrase in Spanish. Carne is Spanish for meat.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Why do people answer these questions when they clearly have no idea of the answer?|`|AA10463356	Jellybean is correct.  All of the words you mention are related to the latin word for meat or flesh. To have carnal knowledge of someone is to know their flesh.   Chili con carne is chili with meat.  Carnival is the holiday before you give up eating meat for lent.|`|rrXkIJ0xaa	No. The "carn" in carnivore simply means "meat". The "vore" in carnivore meaning "eats". If you put the two together, you get "eats meat". This has no relation to carnival or carnal or carne. Hope this helps!|`|DtGFWUP5aa	Carne= meat<br>  <br>  carnal= of the flesh<br>  carnal knowledge= knowledge of matters of the flesh (sex)<br>  <br>  carnivore= eats meat or flesh<br>  <br>  carnival...well i'm not sure but i'd assume that has something to do with that same root. i would google, but you can. :P|`|CM3Fl3WRaa	In Latin (rough translation):<br>  Carnival means farewell (goodbye) to meat. From the period before lent.<br>  Carnal means of the flesh (or meat).<br>  and carnivore means eater of meat.|`|DL3DSG42aa	no. carni means like flesh and meat, and it's not the same root as carnival.|`|IvCJfGaNaa	l|`|uxgp0QI1aa	yeah. they all have cars|`|KJaLmYrraa	carnival:  Although the word carnival designates a time of feasting and fun, it actually means "put the meat away" for Lent. It also comes from the Italian word carnevale, which means 'Shrove Tuesday.' ( source 1)  <br>  <br>  carnal: The word "carnal" derives from latin carnalis, meaning "fleshly" (source 2)<br>  <br>  carnivore: A carnivore (IPA: /?kɑrn?v??r/), meaning 'meat eater' (Latin carne meaning 'flesh' and vorare meaning 'to devour') (source 3)<br>  <br>  chili con carne: In Spanish it translates to chile peppers with meat.  Yes, carnivore and "chili con carne" are related.  the word carne unites the two.  <br>  <br>  The other two: carnival and carnal, do not seem to be related.  They could be, because meat/flesh shows up in all three.  Carnival: "put away the meat", carnal: "of the flesh", and carnivore: "meat eater/flesh eater".  Cool.  I know these websites where I got my information can be messed with, therefore they may be untrue.  But I highly doubt anyone will enter false information about etymology.  I wonder about words too.  There's a podcast that gives you a daily word, and the host describes the root and history of the word.  It's really fun!  I believe it's called podictionary.  You should be able to get it through itunes or zune, or even google it.  Peace!|`|aOXcSVjGaa	Nop!!!!!!! AT ALL!! carnival is a summer "party" usually in latinamerican countrys, the other words has nothing to do with it.|`|jCTFUiOKaa	earthly creatures|`|TJ8fgBpWaa	They are ALL related:<br>  <br>  Carnival is a form of the words in Latin, "carne vale" which is "meat leaves" (goes away), because meat was given up, in the old days (and still is given up by some Catholics) at Lent, the first day of which begins 40 days of partial or total abstaining from meat, or giving up something that you like, as atonement because Christ died for our sins (I'm remembering some of my parochial school catechism classes from decades ago). The Romans used to say hello "Ave" and goodbye "vale." So "ave atque vale" means "hello and goodbye" in latin.<br>  <br>  Some private schools still teach Latin, a useful language to help know English better, but Latin is also the basis of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Castellano, French and Romanian, as well as Ladino, which is the language of many Sephardic Jews. <br>  <br>  Carnal means 'of the flesh' as in "having carnal knowledge of someone," a polite way to say that you know someone sexually.<br>  <br>  Carnivore is a human or animal that eats meat.<br>  <br>  And yes, "chili con carne" IS redundant in a sense, but there also exists vegetarian chili, obviously without meat. 'Chili' is a pepper used in a dish that has meat and beans and chili-spice, or no beans at all in some states or countries.|`|6DFhlt4daa	carno-, carn-, carne-, carni- (Latin: flesh, meat)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wordquests.info/cgi/parseit.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.wordquests.info/cgi/parseit.c...</a><br>  <br>  carnival<br>  <br>  L. caro "flesh" + levare "lighten, raise<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=carnival" rel="nofollow">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term...</a><br>  <br>  carnal<br>  <br>  L. carnis "of the flesh," gen. of caro "flesh."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=carnal&searchmode=none" rel="nofollow">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?sear...</a><br>  <br>  carnivore<br>  <br>  L. carnivorus "flesh-eating," from caro "flesh" + vorare "to devour" <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=carnivore&searchmode=none" rel="nofollow">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?sear...</a><br>  <br>  Chili con carne<br>  <br>  A highly spiced dish made of red peppers, meat, and often beans.<br>  <br>  Spanish for "chili with meat" <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/Chili%20con%20carne" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/Chili%20con%20car...</a><br>  [Spanish : chile, chili + con, with + carne, meat.]|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Of course. Carne is spanish for "meat" so I assume there is a similar Latin word for meat. Chili con carne is chili with meat. Actually, "chili" already implies a meat stew, so the name is redundant. A carnivore eats meat. Carnal refers to pleasures of the flesh. Get it? Flesh, meat? Carnival is the holiday before Lent (also known as Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday) which is traditionally the last day to feast before Lent. Lent involves giving up meat, so naturally Carnival is going to be the last time you can gorge on meat until Easter. I'm pretty sure our term carnival, for a faire, comes from the holiday of Carnival.|`|47a9f147d11fee144c4019cdc8cbba87aa	Carnival comes from the same root wood as carnal and carnivore and several other similar words such as carnage and carnation.

Since you are his biological father you have educational rights and can write a letter requesting services for him, if he does not receive them already. The school districts have a myriad of services from counseling to speech pathology and the resources are there to give support and aid to students that need some extra help. These services, as long as they are needed because academic success is being diminished, are state and federally mandated through FAPE and IDEA. Either contacting the school site itself, or the special education department at the district, can get you started.

I am a retired teacher, Every 6 years the state requires us to adopt new books.  We hated doing the previews on all of the choices, but we were required to do it. When  teachers have to change text books, they have to make new worksheets, and re-learn the whole teaching strategy for the new series of books.

CtqWRAcFaa	Multiplying polynomials is really the same as multiplying two-digit numbers.<br>  <br>  You would not have trouble multiplying a problem like<br>  12 times 31 times 24 because you were taught a technique to do this a long time ago.<br>  <br>  To multiply polynomials, you can use the old familiar techniques too.<br>  <br>  So begin by writing the first two expressions with one underneath the other like this<br>  <br>  x + 2<br>  x - 3<br>  ---------<br>  <br>  Then (just as in numeral multiplication), multiply every term in the top expression by each term in the bottom one.<br>  <br>  Starting with the - 3 in the bottom, multiply it in turn against every term in the top expression, writing down the answers as you go.<br>  <br>  So you say to yourself, " Minus 3 times two equals minus 6," and you write - 6 under the line.<br>  <br>  You're not finished with the - 3 yet, because there is still one item left (the x term) in the top expression, so you continue to solve by thinking, "Minus three times x equals minus three x."  So you write    - 3x under the line too.<br>  <br>  So so far you have this<br>  <br>  x + 2<br>  x - 3<br>  -------------<br>  - 6 - 3x <br>  <br>  Now you start over again, only this time you use the x term in the lower expression and multiply THAT against each of the items in the top.<br>  <br>  So you think to yourself, "X times plus two equals plus two x," so you write + 2x under the line.<br>  <br>  But you're not finished yet, because you have to multiply the bottom x against the other term in the top expression (which is also an x).<br>  <br>  So you think, "And x times x equals plus x squared," so you write x^2 under the line.<br>  <br>  Now you have this<br>  <br>  x + 2<br>  x - 3<br>  --------------<br>  - 6 - 3x + 2x + x^2<br>  <br>  Notice that you can just write the products anywhere (unlike number math, where you have to keep the columns lined up.).<br>  <br>  The next step is to combine any like terms that may be present.  Also, we almost always put the terms in a certain order -- Almost always we start with the term with the highest power of x and go down from there, ending with the number term.<br>  <br>  Doing that gives you<br>  <br>  x^2 - x - 6<br>  <br>  Next you multiply this trinomial by the last binomial in the problem in the exact same way:  Write the binomial under the trinomial, and multiply every one of the terms in the top expression by each of the terms in the bottom expression one at a time.<br>  <br>  x^2 - x - 6<br>  x + 5<br>  -------------------<br>  <br>  Starting with the 5, you think to yourself, "Five times minus six equals minus thirty," so you write - 30 under the line. <br>  <br>  Next you think, "Five times minus x equals minus 5x," so you write - 5x under the line.<br>  <br>  Then you think, "Five times plus x squared equals plus five x squared, so you write + 5x^2 under the line.<br>  <br>  So far you have <br>  <br>  x^2 - x - 6<br>  x + 5<br>  -------------------<br>  - 30 - 5x + 5x^2<br>  <br>  Now you start all over again only this time using the x from the bottom binomial to multiply against each of the terms in the top expression, one at a time.<br>  <br>  So you think, "X times minus six equals minus six x," so you write - 6x under the line.<br>  <br>  Then you think, "X timesnegative  x equals minus x squared," so you write - x^2 under the line.<br>   <br>  Then last you think, "X times x squared equals plus x to the third power," so you write + x^3 under the line.<br>  <br>  So now you have this<br>  x^2 + x - 6<br>  x + 5<br>  -------------------<br>  - 30 - 5x + 5x^2 - 6x - x^2 + x^3<br>  <br>  In standard form, this expression is simplified by combining like terms and writing the terms in descending powers of x.  After you do that work, you end up with this<br>  <br>  x^3 + 4x^2 - 11x - 30 (This is the answer)<br>  <br>  This is a polynomial in the THIRD degree because the highest exponent for x is THREE.<br>  <br>  A polynomial in the FOURTH degree would have the highest exponent of x as FOUR, like this one, which I just made up as an example<br>  3x^4 - 2x^3 + 6x^2 - 8x + 12<br>  <br>  You can tell in advance that the standard form of the given problem was going to end up being in the 3rd degree because there were three x's to get multiplied together.  So that's the highest power of x that could result from that problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  COMMON ERROR:<br>  <br>  A lot of the time, when students multiply two terms which are both positive, they forget to write the product down with a plus sign in front of it, so the terms under the line get all jumbled together.<br>  <br>  Here is an example of this common error<br>    <br>  Given (x^2 + 3x + 7) (x + 5), write this in standard form<br>  <br>  The student starts off fine, and writes<br>  x^2 + 3x + 7<br>  x + 5<br>  -------------------------------<br>  The student thinks, "Five times seven equals 35," so he writes down 35.<br>  <br>  Then he thinks "Five times 3x equals fifteen x," so he writes down 15x.<br>  <br>  Then he thinks "Five times x squared equals five x squared," so he writes down 5x^2<br>  <br>  But look at what he gets when he does that without remembering to write a plus sign in front of the positive terms<br>  <br>  x^2 + 3x + 7<br>  x + 5<br>  -------------------------------<br>  3515x5x^2   This doesn't even mean ANYTHING!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Ann|`|4c8ab139bf95dbc97c7afe8fa56e034daa	General form is to have the polynomial equal to zero.<br>  <br>  Just do FOIL twice<br>  <br>  so:<br>  <br>  (x+2)(x-3)(x+5)<br>  <br>  becomes<br>  <br>  (x^2 -x -6)(x+5)<br>  x^3 -x^2 -6x +5x^2 -5x -30<br>  x^3 +4x^2 -11x -30 = 0<br>  <br>  You'd multiply by another x to get a 4th degree poly... this one is only three.

wUhdHHc4aa	The best way to feel secure about all the big things to do is to make lists. Write down what you have to do, when you have to do it by, and if it's far in the future, don't worry about it. Trust me, getting stressed out only makes things worse. <br>  To feel more secure about the SAT, there's lots of practice books out there. I advise getting your SAT or ACT out of the way so you don't have to worry about it your senior year. And then when it's done, it's done!<br>  Junior year is when things seem most scary, but you will get a handle on it. The fact that you're worried about things means you're one step ahead of all those people who aren't worrying.|`|P5lYzweEaa	my suggestion is you need to do thing in order. Don't get to much stressed it will ruin  all your work. if you get very stress you should stop what are you doing even it very important thing like homework that due tomorrow but you don't even started . find something that you like such as listen to music or play piano or whatever and give yourself a rest. that what i always did when i get  very stressing.

50bEHtYfaa	If you are a freshman in high school then you still have a long way to go. You won't start applying to colleges until your senior year of high school. Your academic counselor will help you out with this. Also there are many different colleges to choose from. They have many different programs and majors to choose from. When you get into college you have 2 years to decide what you want to major in. Your first 2 years in college will just be regular core classes, which everyone has to take. In college your academic ad-visor can help you declare a major and they will guide you in the direction you want to go. So don't stress about it, you still have a while to go.<br>  <br>  You can search online or ask your counselor for those "major tests." These tests are multiple choice and you choose different categories of interest or w.e and they tell you what you might want to major in based off your answers. I took one in high school.|`|hfH8c1LWaa	all sorts, just think about something that interests u and im almost certain some college somewhere will have a major for it.<br>  <br>  and its ok u dont know what u want to do, i dont, and im a freshman in college. just do what interests u and go from there.

RKLFYS2Naa	A musician that plays instruments that are 'hit' to make sounds (e.g. drums)...<br>  <br>  Percussion instruments are played by being struck or shaken. They are perhaps the oldest form of musical instruments. Some percussion instruments play not only rhythm, but also melody and harmony. <br>  The two major categories are membranophones, which add timbre to the sound of being struck, such as drums, and idiophones, which sound of themselves, such as the triangle. <br>  <br>  The tambourine is both membranophone and idiophone. <br>  <br>  Most percussion instruments have a distinct tone; even drums are tuned. However, a distinction is usually made based on whether the instrument can play a definite pitch or not. <br>  <br>  The timpani, xylophone, vibraphone, bell, tubular bells and glockenspiel all play a definite pitch. The snare drum, bass drum, cymbal, triangle, maracas, claves, castanets, tom-tom, timbales, cowbell, washboard and wood block do not in general. However, some percussionists tune drum heads to specific pitches when recording albums or in preparation for specific composer requirements. Gongs can be tuned or untuned – the most familiar type of gong in the west, the chau gong (sometimes called a tam-tam), is untuned. Tuned cymbals exist but are rare. <br>  <br>  The general term for a musician who plays percussion instruments is percussionist. Drummer refers to a musician who primarily plays drums including the drumset and hand drums. A timpanist is a musician who primarily plays timpani. Marimbist generally refers to a solo artist who plays the marimba.
j9Xx8syQaa	First of all take a deep breath. Not everyone is a 'math thinker'. And, that's ok... to tell you the truth I can think well in math but am not to good at 'English'. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. Yes, we have to 'manage' our weaknesses in some ways, but you are going to be successful because of your strengths. Please don't lose sight of that! There are plenty of people out there who have a very hard time with math or some other subject in school that are quite successful in the world. So, remember that first, ok. <br>  <br>  Now, to manage the weakness so that it doesn't get you so down... Have you talked to your teacher? Maybe they can help or suggest something else that you can do for extra practice. See if there is a student in the class or in 7th or 8th grade that might be willing to help you out. Or, you can get a tutor to help you out. If you can find someone who is willing to spend a little time with you it's often possible that you can understand what you are trying to learn... there are many approaches to math problems (ways to explain them) and if you can get someone to try a different approach it may become more clear. Talk to your teacher and your parents about how you are feeling and get some extra help on the math. But, remember, just because you aren't a math whiz doesn't mean you are a failure.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Sounds like you could use a really GOOD math teacher.<br>  <br>  My daughter was where you were 8 years ago.<br>  Her teacher's methods were fine for average students, but my girl had a few special needs, so she was left behind in class.<br>  <br>  Once she was in a special school, she caught up...and when she got a REALLY good math teacher, suddenly math made a lot more sense!<br>  <br>  Don't give up...and don't be afraid to ask questions...good luck!|`|R8fVBPnmaa	Maybe you should try asking a few times each semester & just claim that you are just trying to keep certain things,steps or process in mind until you might find that certain edge they'll make certain things as`far as whichever work/assignment fresh on your mind !! & or learning certain tricks to doing certain this !?!

Take a step back and just live in the moment, think of what you can do in a day, what you can do in a week, don't think too far in the future.  Get a list, and go by what you need to do to take good grades, such as doing homework, studying, taking notes, and looking at notes the day before the test.  Just relax and have fun in the grade you are in.  If your school changes due to going to 7th, I"m sure that's why you feel sad,because you know there will be change.  I can only say, take each day at a time, be yourself and be true to yourself, think before you act.  <br>  <br>  As for math, oh i hated math when I was in school, and I always got stuck with math teachers who couldn't teach.  I did had to take some courses over again, but I think it's mainly because of the way it's being taught.  The good thing about the internet is that its a good source of help and references if you can't get the help at school or with your parents.  Perhaps have a study person to help you with some problems.  Math is all about steps and if you go out of order, the equation may not work o ut, so get a good pace, and list the steps to help you as you do your homework.
219Mkbtqaa	Depends how well are you doing in those classes right now? AP is a lot to take on.  I know AP chem is a lot of work or at least it was at our high school.  It all depends on how good of teachers you have, your schedule outside school, and how committed you are to your homework.

Dh0JX2Onaa	Take the Bio and Chemistry classes. They will be the most useful for you./|`|v5SXqxo0aa	I would take AP Chem. Almost certainly the hardest pre requisites for Medical School is undergraduate Organic Chemistry. Most universities use this class as a "weeder" class for potential doctors. A weeder class is a class that about 50-60% of the starting class either drops or fails. <br>  <br>  AP Chem won't let you test out of anything usually, especially if you have a science related major, but it will give you a bit of introduction to the subject.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fKFPiTEiaa	It's probably relative to your preferred field. Physics, Dentistry, general medicine...  I think Physics and Biology would probably be best at this point. My brother had to take pre med biology, anyway, and he's becoming an Orthodontist. I took Physical Science last semester, to get out of biology. I'm just a little bit biased. :) Physics will come in extremely handy, if you can learn to understand it from a medical standpoint. Nothing is without cause. I think a lot of medical doctors make that mistake. Physics isn't all about motion (which can cause such things as sprains), it's about energy and mass. Your potential future patients will have those, measurable in kilos and joules and watts. These can be converted to lbs, calories, and calories per minute, if you know the proper conversion rate. If a doctor can figure out the amount of force the two hundred pound adult male sustained when a 25 lb. sack of potatoes flew out a second story window and semi in elastically landed on him, then I think he'd be better able to help the man, yeah? You should probably head start your physics, and save the chem. for college. Also, there was a potty mouth nurse in my class. Do what you think is best. Look to the student adviser. But, I sure did have a lot of fun learning conceptual physical science...|`|rTKjGBYkaa	Well if anything, don't take physics because that has the least pertinence to your desired field of study.  And if you're talking about AP Physics B or C, those are two of the hardest classes ever.<br>  <br>  If you're going to be a doctor I'd take AP Bio, but it really doesn't matter.  Obviously you'd want to take college courses on your subject matter anyway, so it's just what you like more.  AP Bio is more just memorizing stuff so if you work hard you'll be fine.  AP Chem you actually have to understand, but if you were good at chem, then go for it.  I'd say if you're talented at chem go for AP Chem because though it's rigorous, it has less "busy work" than AP Bio.  Not to say it's less time consuming though.

UOmhBNxKaa	When I owned and operated my own home-based facility, I made it very clear to the parents that it was a family environment.  We went to mass on Tuesday morning,  signed ourselves when we said our prayers at meals, listened to Christian music and said "God bless you" when someone would sneeze.  If they opted to bring their child they knew they'd be participating in all aspects of our program.  The ones that attended were Catholic, Baptist, and Jewish.  None of them complained because they knew what they were getting into.  And I received USDA food program money.  That has nothing to do with your program except the food you provide. The ones who did object, didn't enroll their child with me.<br>  <br>  If your school let it be known from enrollment that it was faith-based, then I feel you have nothing to complain about.  If that is the case, then find a new facility and move on.  If they weren't open about it then you might raise some concerns with the administration, board of directors, etc.  Or even set up a parent meeting if other parent's are concerned also.<br>  <br>  But realistically, at least they are listening to appropriate music and not the stuff on normal radio stations.  That aspect could always be worse.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Sounds as if you have broached it with the administration and they have said they want to continue as they are.<br>  <br>  Is this a state-provided facility, or do you pay? If you pay, I think it would be deeply petty to try to get them into trouble for it. It sounds as if they are completely up front about their Christian focus given that they publicly play the music.|`|gyzMxjAiaa	When you enrolled your child were you informed that it was faith based? If not, and if they are accepting government funding you have every right to be angry. Whether they are breaking the rules depends very much on what state you are in. I'd find another program, as much because of their attitude towards your concern as because of what they are doing in the classroom. Then I would contact whatever agency in your state administers the food program and file a complain. You could also contact the American Civil Liberties Union.|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	Hmmmm. If you do not have a problem with the religious aspect, then maybe you just need to find out what they are teaching,  and what religious material is being used. I think the problem with may be with you. Ouch.... sorry if that hurt. The truth is, are you objecting to him being exposed to religion, or are you objecting to religion altogether? I would seriously speak with the administration, without the judgmental tone that they are wrong, and ask what their religious beliefs are and how are they presented to the kids. Are these songs and such part of the curriculum? then you could look at the lesson plans for the week to give you an idea what she will be exposed to. Is this a faith-based program? they can still get government money. that should not be an issue. If you do not want you child exposed to any religion in school, be prepared for a long ride. Government schools today teach extreme liberal values, far worse than any religion they get in preschool.|`|e8wDogqdaa	Sounds to me like you have had problems before and still are. Take your child out. You made the comment that they made a comment like "If you don't like it go somewhere else." You should go somewhere else. I am not saying that the school should bend to each parents wants and or needs because then they would have no children in their school...they would be to busy trying to please everyone. But to be met with such a rude comment??? Listen if the school is talking to you in such a rude matter you need to leave. It is very disrespectful for any person of authority to talk to a person this way especially since you are paying them (either out of pocket, or by government help) to help your child grow. If i where talked to that way just for expressing a concern I would have left immediately!     And just so you know your child will love any day care as long as he/she is haveing fun there.|`|i5tOQGgFaa	It should have been in the policies and in your first conversations at enrollment whether this is a faith based facility or not.  Maybe it's time to review the policies, day care philosophy etc prior to going to administration with this concern.  Accepting vouchers from a food program is different than government funding.  It plays no effect in what is being taught at the program.  Is this something that just started or has been going on since the beginning of the year?   Sounds to me that it's part of their curriculum.  You have the right to ask the administrators to consider your feelings but their philosophy and policies have been written before your family began attendence, I'm sure and I doubt they are going to change it.  I really have a hard time believing this just started out of the blue.  I think there was a little miscommunication somewhere.  In every faith-based facility that I have dealt with in the last 10+ years...all have been very open and sure to make you aware that some "religion" will be taught.  Good luck in  your decision making...this sounds like a tough one for you.  I have the same thought...I have no problem with religion but I want it taught here at home with my influence.  :-)|`|A7YaIbHYaa	Hi Jack,<br>  I've been studying ECE for the past few years and have worked at a few centers.  I understand your concern by the attitude that you were met with by your school's administrators.  What I've been taught (and what I've experienced) is that the schools who take the time to care about their families are the best ones.  In our classes we discuss how to build trusting relationships with parents because, after all, parents are their child's first and most important teachers.  My philosophy is that schools should form a partnership and work together with parents, instead of steamrolling over them with the mentality that "we're the experts".  <br>  It seems, from what you mentioned, that the school, either purposefully or inadvertantly, broke this trust.  Comments such as "If you don't like it, go elsewhere" send a message to me that your voice as a parent and partner are not being respected.  Regardless of whether or not they are teaching religion without your knowledge, is this the kind of attitude you would expect from a place you send your child?  Are you as a primary caregiver being respected? Is your knowledge about your child being respected?  Do you feel like the school makes an effort to build trust?  I don't know all of your circumstances at the preschool, but this is something you may want to discern.  If you answered no to those questions, I might consider finding a new center for your child.  Centers that take the time to work with you and your family, that form partnerships, that respect your knowledge, and that honor your voice are ones I would look for.  <br>  First, though, I would set up a meeting with the administrators and your child's teacher to see what can be done to help clarify this and any other misunderstandings. Any preschool worth attending would want to keep parents and children in their centers and to work out problems.  However, if you find this isn't the case, again I would advocate for investigating other preschools in your area. <br>  Hope this helps!
mhFpZT3laa	I'm sure a few do, because I know former chiropractors that switched into medicine. It is certainly a lot easier and faster as well. There are many problems with our current medical field, but scientific basis of knowledge is not one of them. Chiropractitioning and other alternative medicines are simply a sign of the fact that doctors are very overburdened with patients, and can no longer spend time building relationships like they once could.

Then, I may not have been listening to them very carefully! In other countries I think eh is a kind of question mark. For instance, she looks kinda cute eh, the eh being put into the end of the sentence to elicit either a positive or negative response. What do you think, in other words. The one expression I have from French Canada is ' tabarnac' which is a sort of swear word which I think is derived from the influence of the Catholic church in Quebec. Anyway Canadians are very nice people generally...apart from the Montreal Mafia, and I hope to go back there one day and listen to their accent a little bit closer with particular attention to the exclamation 'EH'.

uOkfuPGqaa	First you should find out what is typically an argument for the topic. In this case, most people would say it negatively affects children + teens, but some may say the opposite. (There are different and more detailed arguments.) Now pick your side, then find out why you feel this way. Then figure out the opinions of the opposition, and get a statement that says why your side is stronger and your evidence.<br>  <br>  Example: Marijuana: Should it be legal?<br>  One side: Yes, it is highly beneficial and relaxes the soul.<br>  Other side: No, it is harmful to the body and addictive.<br>  <br>  Thesis one: Marijuana should be legal because it calms people's state of mind, and helps clear out pantries by giving users "the munchies."<br>  <br>  Thesis two: Marijuana should be illegal because it freaks people out, is addictive, causes health issues, and causes my cabinets to empty out because of the evil "munchies."<br>  <br>  I do not wish to give you a thesis statement because you should make up your own with your beliefs in order for it to be the most effective. If someone gives you a reason that you don't believe in, then it would be hard to support it.
YbwDFvEaaa	There have been many studies suggesting that in the interest of working in school when teenagers are at their peak concentration level, classes should be starting much later in the morning than they currently do. <br>  <br>  However, because of after school activities, most schools will not start classes any later during the week. If classes are started later, then after school sports and clubs would be kept later as well, and students would not be getting home until pretty late in the evening, when they should be home working on homework and eating supper with their families.<br>  <br>  Elementary schools can start later simply because they don't have the same after school obligations. This is unfortunate, as young children seem to be awake at the crack of dawn anyway.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	Yes. The reason it's the schedule is so early is because your school staff is the one that makes the rules and their clocks are earlier. It makes more since to go by the students because it's about your success and there's more of you than there is of staff.|`|kiJ0rUrVaa	we call them high schools in manchester too, i think so aswell but suprisingly i tend to do better in classes in the morning... i mean my school starts at 8.30am and ends at 3pm it would be good if it started at 9.30 or 10am and ended at around 4.30 or 5... i agree with you|`|db82e50b29bf9812520947d2b57f0246aa	yep :D|`|DotTGIdYaa	That's definitely a good point.<br>  <br>  Teenagers can't concentrate very well if they have to wake up at <br>  7:00 in the morning to go to school,  when i wake up i'm still tired and find it hard to concentrate in morning lessons.<br>  <br>  Although you are sacrificing your after school time, at least you won't be grumpy and unfocused when you go to school - it's depressing enough as it is.|`|iiRbOAQnaa	It should, when I was in high school my district declined to change time because many of the high schoolers had middle or elementary school age siblings i.e. the school district wanted to make sure if that was a family's situation, the oldest of the children would get home first to care for the rest until parents got home.|`|x7FjDcjzaa	suck it up--when you are an adult, you have to get up early for work even if your body doesn't want to so it is good training for that|`|e2GYTWXaaa	well they are going to do that at my local 6th form college a few days a week to try it out.<br>  <br>  I wonder how it will go.

AA11949266	Tone <br>  The author’s implicit attitude toward the reader or the people, places, and events in a work as revealed by the elements of the author’s style. Tone may be characterized as serious or ironic, sad or happy, private or public, angry or affectionate, bitter or nostalgic, or any other attitudes and feelings that human beings experience. <br>  (taken from source.)<br>  <br>  Tone and attitude are very similar. When someone asks for a speaker's tone and attitude they're asking about how the author tells a story. Is he mad? Is he regretful, nostalgic? and et cetera. You can find out what the speaker's tone and attitude are by their word choice, actions, and even information that you are given.<br>  <br>  The source below is a really helpful site with a glossary of literature terms.<br>  <br>  I hope this was quite helpful! ;) good luck.|`|641d27f131f7134a1b1a8cf843039e7daa	Some examples might help.<br>  You phone about your telephone bill.

You feel a little silly at having made the call but the employee assures you that that is what they are there for and makes you feel valued.  You are thanked for your custom and the call ends leaving you feeling well disposed towards the company.<br>  <br>  Same scenario, different employee.  The second employee says almost exactly the same thing but with a detached air sounding  like a smart *** and giving you the feeling of wasting their time with your enquiry.  You are asked if the explanation is satisfactory and the call ends leaving you feeling extremely dissatisfied.<br>  <br>  A child is misbehaving.  The mother is chatting to a friend and tells the child to behave in an offhand voice returning immediately to her conversation.

It may take a long time to happen, but God's process of judgement will be very exacting, and no-one will slip through the net.
ZWzcrdn0aa	Yes, on a need basis.  The Ivies value diversity in their student bodies so they look for bright kids no matter where they're from or their financial circumstances.

It is absolutely beautiful and I think to myself "I would like to explore this land."<br>    We brought the clipper as close to the shore as possible, without bottoming out the ship.

Go to their website and find when they will offer it not too far from your home.  You might also be able to arrange a private administration.  <br>  <br>  What many boarding schools do for international applicants who are unable to visit is to arrange for a local interview with an alumnus.  <br>  <br>  I cannot give you any probability of an acceptance.  First, Andover is a reach school for even the most qualified applicants because they have a low acceptance rate of around 20%.  Second, I don't know whether or not you are a late applicant, which does lower your chances.<br>  <br>  There are many great boarding schools.  Broaden your search to find some more schools that interest you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SfiLlVG4aa	Andover likes well rounded kids, grades aren't everything, although they  do matter.  You need to take the SSATs in order to apply, and you're past the deadline, which severely lowers your chances of getting in.  Next year you could apply, or apply as a repeat.

Internships around your junior year is excellent for you too because you can figure out what is possible to do with your degree.<br>  <br>  If you go to the prestigious school and come out with tons of debt, a lot of times you were be worse off than the person who went the more economical route and doesn't owe as much.|`|AA11137734	I think that a 3.5 gpa is Ivy league material.

CtqWRAcFaa	Thesis:  "The high cost of post-secondary education is a myth."<br>  <br>  The issue is really not whether the costs of post-secondary education are "high," since "high" is a relative term with no fixed definition.  The issue is actually, "Is post-secondary education UNAFFORDABLE?"<br>  <br>  The reality is that almost all students can afford to attend any school for which they were accepted.<br>  <br>  Scholarships (from the school or from other sources), grants, student loans, and work-study (or other kinds of student employment) supplement the student's family's financial contribution.  In fact, every post-secondary school maintains a  financial aid office for the sole purpose of ensuring that every student who has been accepted is able to attend.  <br>  <br>  Furthermore, no matter how much money is spent on post-secondary education, it is almost always a good bargain.  Every degree earned beyond a high school diploma adds significantly to the lifetime earnings of those graduating from institutions of higher learning.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dear student:<br>  I think you could Google studies that show how much more a person with a BA earns over a high school graduate, and how much more a person with an MA earns, and so on, to support the claim that any money spent on higher education is a good bargain.

4WHgZw01aa	those are hilarious. theyre all generally the same. "write about a time that you had to make a difficult decision..." blah blah blah. heres what i did just about every time. i made it up. make it into a story, relatively reasonable of course. dont write about the time you had to give up smoking cuz your kid has asthma, or about the time you decided to buy a hybrid car cuz its environmentally friendly. write about something that happens to kids. just pick a belief, such as a belief that kids shouldnt drink, and your friends all drink, so you had to stand up for your belief and decided not to go to a party, etc etc. the more creative makes the story longer, and longer is always better in TAKS essays, especially if you use a personal experience story written in first person. the graders are mostly college students and some grade school teachers, they know this essay doesnt reflect your intelligence. they just want to make sure you can put ideas onto paper in an organized fashion. so whatever you write about, always always always follow this format: intro, body, body, body, conclsion. remember to use as many body paragraphs as you need. and nbefore you start writing, pop a peppermint in your mouth, and take a deep breath. :)

e940a673cb9a39741324c3fdcd99b7daaa	Scientific notation is the way that scientists easily handle very large numbers or very small numbers. For example, instead of writing 0.0000000056, we write 5.6 x 10-9. So, how does this work?<br>  <br>  We can think of 5.6 x 10-9 as the product of two numbers: 5.6 (the digit term) and 10-9 (the exponential term).<br>  <br>  <br>  Scientific notation is used to express very large or very small numbers. A number in scientific notation is written as the product of a number (integer or decimal) and a power of 10. The number has one digit to the left of the decimal point. The power of ten indicates how many places the decimal point was moved. <br>  <br>  The decimal number 0.00000065 written in scientific notation would be 6.5x10-7 because the decimal point was moved 7 places to the right to form the number 6.5. It is equivalent to 6.5*0.1*0.1*0.1*0.1*0.1*0.1*0.1 <br>  <br>  A decimal number smaller than 1 can be converted to scientific notation by decreasing the power of ten by one for each place the decimal point is moved to the right. <br>  <br>  Scientific notation numbers may be written in different forms.

Columbus isn't the poor actually. Just cheaper to get into.<br>  If you're living on campus in the apartments, try to use scholarships and loans. If you get the HOPE scholarship, you won't have to worry about tuition and some fees. Books will kill you! Plan for about $400 a semester for that. Don't get a meal plan unless you have to cause you live on campus. I survive off of $35 a week for food but I get the cheap off-brand stuff (consider that). You'll get lots of t-shirts so wear those out so you don't have to shop as much.<br>  I know this all sounds crazy, but once you get into college and you're paying for it yourself, things change! There's lots of places to eat in columbus, cheap and expensive. So you decide.<br>  I put all my graduation money aside plus all the money I earned from the summer and it still wasn't enough. You'll quickly learn though.|`|mCypPGXGaa	I personally have a lot of bills and cannot afford to save much of any money for school. A loan is my expectation.

UYfeRLxwaa	First of all, almost everyone screws up their freshman year - but recover from it because they grew and learned from their mistakes. I've been there. Take classes you would actually enjoy being in (electives) and stay on top of your core classes (math, english, etc.) Looking back on it, all high school really was, was doing mediocre work. You can do the work, sure it's boring but life can't be 100% exciting all the time. Try to get a B in all of your classes, its extremely do-able. Stay focused and have fun - learn the balance. You will need a 3.5 GPA to get into a good college, so I suggest you work towards that. It is so important, and you seem like you know this - so work hard, have fun (its high school, you're only there once!) and strive towards what you hope to become. Good luck!

Some kind of stimulus triggers an electric discharge of the cell which is analogous to the discharge of a capacitor. This produces an electrical pulse on the order of 50-70 millivolts called an action potential. The electrical impulse propagates down the fiber-like extension of the nerve cell (the axon). The speed of transmission depends upon the size of the fiber, but is on the order of tens of meters per second - not the speed of light transmission that occurs with electrical signals on wires. Once the signal reaches the axon terminal bundle, it may be transmitted to a neighboring nerve cell with the action of a chemical neurotransmitter.

PQWTTcERaa	Context clue sentences are sentences in which the person who is having difficulty reading will be able to figure out a hard word by its context in the sentence.  Examples:<br>  <br>  We could not hear the speaker very well until he turned on his microphone.<br>  <br>  When they were hungry, they stopped at a nice restaurant to eat.<br>  <br>  Because Mary had very little money, the gift she bought was not expensive.<br>  <br>  In each case, there is a rather difficult word (microphone, restaurant, and expensive) that is harder than the other words in the sentence, but the context helps the reader figure it out.|`|58cbd85283f455744aabf28d211d431baa	Text book writers usually know when they must use a word that will be new to their student readers. So they often include other words or phrases to help with the understanding of the new word. These words or phrases are referred to as context clues. They are built into the sentences around the difficult word. If you become more aware of the words around the difficult words you encounter in your reading, you will save your self many trips to the dictionary. You will be able to make logical guesses about the meanings of many words.|`|AA11949266	Context clue sentences are sentences in which you are able to figure out what a new word might mean from using other words in the sentence to help you figure it out.<br>  <br>  Forexample:<br>  Plausible - The lawyer had plausible evidence that his client was innocent.<br>  Plausible means to be worthy of belief. From this sentence, you can deduce that plausible would mean somewhere along the lines of that definition.

AA11283779	Based on what I read, you'll need to attend a CC for a while and aim for 3.5-4.0 GPA.  Granted, the schools you're looking at are smaller and may be more lax when it comes to admissions requirement, but 1. you high school GPA is not great (regardless of the fact that it is a good private school) and 2. your performance at CC so far is poor.  There is no way to get around that.  Tech schools like DeVry or ITT Tech are usually more forgiving but they're not the same as 4-year universities.  If you want to go to the schools you named, you'll really have to put in the effort.

AA11043457	Sure.  They have to take time to teach kids how to test.  That may be a good thing in the long run as kids test all their lives, but some is specific to te tests.  There are lots of things to learn and if they are teaching how to take the test or teaching to the test, then they may be missing some things they would like to teach. They need to teach thinking and logic skills.  They need to teach you to read and write well.  That might be part of the testing so that is not wasted.  <br>  <br>  And teachers and students get so stressed that they may not do as well as they could otherwise.  Many kids may learn something to use it and then promptly forget it when they should be learning and changing their lives.

They could be <br>  math grades, for example.<br>  <br>  The MEAN is the arithmetic average, the average you are probably used <br>  to finding for a set of numbers - add up the numbers and divide by how <br>  many there are:  (80 + 90 + 90 + 100 + 85 + 90) / 6 = 89 1/6.<br>  <br>  The MEDIAN is the number in the middle. In order to find the median, <br>  you have to put the values in order from lowest to highest, then find <br>  the number that is exactly in the middle:<br>  <br>          80   85   90   90   90   100<br>                       ^<br>       since there is an even number of values, the MEDIAN is <br>       between these two, or it is 90. Notice that there is <br>       exactly the same number of values ABOVE the median as <br>       BELOW it!<br>  <br>  The MODE is the value that occurs most often. In this case, since <br>  there are 3 90's, the mode is 90. A set of data can have more than one <br>  mode.<br>  <br>  The RANGE is the difference between the lowest and highest values. <br>  In this case 100 - 80 = 20, so the range is 20. The range tells you <br>  something about how spread out the data are. Data with large ranges <br>  tend to be more spread out.

aPCO8ygWaa	The distraction happens to me all the time, sometimes I find myself studying the night before. <br>  To help you so that you don't feel overwhelmed by the amount of stuff to cover and you know about a test or assignment ahead of time, break the chapters up to read each day. (ex: ch1 on monday, ch2 tuesday, ch3 wed etc. ) divided the chapters equally so that you don't run out of time to study.<br>  Another tip is take really good notes in class, then when you get home rewrite or retype them, for me rewriting or retyping helps me, and it keeps everything organized. <br>  And another thing, when you study, set a time limit. (ex: tell yourself "I am going to study Math for an hour." when the hour is up put it aside and take a small break or move on to another subject.) Sometimes for me if I keep going for a long time on a subject I get tired and can no longer focus.<br>  VERY IMPORTANT!<br>  Find a quite place where there are no distractions (like school library, public library.) <br>  Or if its better for you, play some quite soft music, like Enya .<br>  <br>  Good Luck I hope these tips help you|`|uakaLRFraa	I will read something, then cover up what I just read and try to repeat it without looking.  Getting it right word for word doesn't matter; I just have to remember the concepts.  Until I can copy down or recite what I studied without looking at it, I don't stop.<br>  <br>  For example, if I'm trying to memorize definitions:  I'll read the word and its definition, then cover up the definition and see if I can remember everything just by looking at the word itself.  And I don't do this just once; each time I try to recite a definition, I also try to recite all the ones before it as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for motivating myself to study, I find that it's best to be alone in a quiet room with a bowl of snack food.  I also try to stay away from things that would distract me (read: fun things) such as the TV, computer, pets, video games, friends, wild parties, etc.<br>  <br>  The trick is to be doing nothing except studying; the food is there to keep your mouth busy.  Some people are also helped by background noise.  If you want to listen to music while you study, only listen to something you've heard a thousand times before, so you don't think about it too much.|`|DxFxMiMraa	Okay, this happened to me a couple years back, I know what it's like.<br>  <br>  So, you're trying to study and you daze off thinking about what happened today, what you're going to do tomorrow, or just plain not doing anything. <br>  <br>  This is what you should do. <br>  <br>  Find yourself an accordion folder, super cheap--you can find them for 50 cents in places. <br>  <br>  This will be your study folder. Label the accordions accordingly [no pun intended] to each of your classes. <br>  <br>  Put notes from class in your folder.<br>  <br>  POST IT NOTES ARE YOUR BEST FRIEND!; they are great for small notes in your textbooks and different other things, you'll find uses for them all the time..<br>  <br>  Eat a snack/drink before you study. Have all materials in your study room. Make sure it's quiet. Try to avoid sugary food, and be concentrating on what you're doing, all the time.<br>  <br>  You'll get used to concetrating in a couple days.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)
AA11434355	Try breaking them into small groups to discuss specific aspects of your topic. You can then bring them all back to share and discuss further what they came up with in their groups.|`|9hC5zE64aa	A teacher cannot give continuous lecture; if he/she does, the students' minds will go somewhere. The only duty of a teacher is to motivate and inspire the students.

You would be unhappy you had to go to classes and do homework and such.  You would be unhappy in the short term.  But after you graduated and found out the advantages it gave you, like knowing more and getting better jobs, etc., you would be happy that you had done it.  So you would be happy in the long term.|`|FmYkUfIDaa	Hi Somethir,<br>  It suggests that for the greater part of your day/life you will be happy and therefore, for the shorter part of your day/life you will be unhappy.<br>  <br>  Now this might mean that for 51% of your day/ life you will be happy and for 49% of your day/life you will be unhappy.<br>  <br>  You really need to do something about this because you can't spent almost half of your life being unhappy.

For me, I have to listen to classical or something non-lyrical if I'm reading, because if it has words then I can't concentrate on what I'm reading. But if I'm doing math or something then I can listen to stuff with words. Some people can listen to really hard music and still be fine, and some can't. Just try different things out.

Kaudz4Msaa	I am a teacher.  All I can tell you is no matter what the age, we would have suspended the student who did that.  It endangered another child's health.      You should already have had a conference with your child's teacher to find out what happened.  You can ask what kind of supervision there is and how your son is treated.    Is there a school counselor?  I would talk to this person for advice, also.  Of course, the child's parents have already been called.      Your boy may be bullied, and I would look for other signs.  If this is a chronic problem, you must nip it in the bud.  Speak to him frankly but not in an off-putting way, about how people treat him in school.  If it's bad, you need to address this with the principal and in no uncertain terms make clear you will not tolerate it.|`|2daf1f643b0222e20fe97c10246019f0aa	As a parent, you must stand up for your child in any situation like this.  There is a "Safe Schools Act" that is or should be enforced by every principal and school in the United States.  Many law suits have been won because principals have taken the "look the other way" or don't do it again" approach.  If you really want to get things stirred up legally, contact the principal and tell him that you aren't satisfied with the attempted poisoning of your son, and the way the situation was handled, and your attorney will be contacting  him and the school board because of his lack of enforcing "The Safe Schools Act" to your satisfaction.  And  then do contact an attorney...believe me, something WILL be done.   Good luck.  morattlesnake@yahoo.com and mark it "Safe Schools Act" if you need additional information.|`|AMgvjVqBaa	First, I would talk to the teacher.  Because she supposed to know whats going on in her classroom. If the teacher did not do anything about it,..I will go straight to the principal.  And if the principal didnt do anything about it,..then I will call the superintendent to inform her/him about the situation that needed attention.  And if none of the above people  actually didnt do anything to take care of the situation...then,  Its just too bad I have to call the Dept of Education and also Human Services.    If the angry child put that sanitizer on other child's bottle...that behavior is considered Bullying.  Whatever provoke or cause this child to be angry, he could have killed your child if not sicker from that chemical he put in the bottle.  And nowadays, ..Bullying is absolutely untoleratable.

That is not the purpose of the class. If the students are lazy and don't do their homework, then their grade should reflect it.  However, it is certainly not appropriate to do a clean up like this.  This isn't high school.  I realize this is extra credit but why?  /It has nothng to do with the subject area.<br>  <br>  Having said that, if you still want to do this you probably would need your department chair's approval and then the dean's approval.  I think they may be concerned about lability issues.  Drivers are crazy today. I'd not want to be out along the road in many areas.  We just had something near where I live recently where a Porche was racing another sports car on A-1A near the beach (small road, not some highway) and the Porsche lost ocntrol went over the curb and mowed down two visiting Brittish business men who were here trying to find employees for their firm in England.  Killed them.  Porche owner was from wealthy Chicago family and claimed he wasn't driving.  He was on probation in Chicago for hitting a police officer and injuring a citizen - was on drugs at the time.  He hasn't been arrested for the murders yet.  Judge in Chicago did revoke his probation beause he didn't complete a drug rehab program.  And he was seen leaving a restaurant in his Porche shortly before the incident, but then he laims he wasn't driving the car and referred them to his attorney.  There is way too much of that anymore.  I'd not want to be responsible for taking any studens onto the roads.  <br>  <br>  Maybe there will be some kind of math project for extra redit so if tey work, they can get a better grade, but it will be related to the subjet matter and should be safe.
TTpf5tlMaa	From a general standpoint:  yes.  Most kids don't want to be bothered with learning Math, English, Science, etc.  They just want to eat lunch and go outside and play.  In this case, it is definitely right to force kids to learn such things.  Conversely, if kids are being asked to participate in one-on-one combat with knives and the victor is the only one left alive, then i'm going to have to roll with no, that is not right.  They should both come out of the ring alive.  <br>  <br>  (For those of you who just did a double take, yes, our children should definitely be taught how to defend themselves.  Don't be silly and think such confrontational situations should be avoided).<br>  <br>  If you can provide more specific examples, then I can provide a more specific answer.|`|JYXDj402aa	like what?<br>  <br>  english,science,math should be mandetory.<br>  <br>  but stuff like p.e or religion should be optinal|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	We all have to do things in our daily lives that we don't want to do.

Most of them don't like tests but if you don't do a certain amount of testing how will you know if they have learned and retained  the material?

If youre talking about doing something like maths for instance, most kids dont really want to do that subject, let alone go to school half of the time. But these different lessons teach you specific and different things such as ways of thinking and things, and exercising your brain from a younger age I think allows these people to grow more intelectually later in life. So I think that making kids do a variety of subjects (even though they dont like them) is neccesary as they are not old enough to make a decision based on something they have thought about for a long time.<br>  But what I dont understand is the 'somethings' which are not right.

My teens took the basic seminar and there is nothing available like it in schools.All the folks I have met there are educated and responsible kinds of people who want to leave their past problems behind.<br>  Like anything else, there are always pushy people who give an organization a bad rap.|`|1173128171f3702325367424cffbb516aa	If you are daft enough to go please feel free <br>  there is an old saying a fool and his money are soon parted<br>  There is no real problem in sorting ones self out get a life and stop giving these con merchants the time of day it is like the team building weekends a complete wast of time don't make you do the job any better but certainly make the people who run them a lot of money i no i ran them for a major company till i realised that they were just a con and my mind got the better of me now i sleep a lot better

4Wull7b2aa	Hi, I'm doing the IB1 program atm. I mean, its pretty tough and a lot of work, but I still think for me this was the right choice. Of course, like all higher level education programmes, IB tends to be harder than the things you did before and might feel like a bit of a jump (but good your doing pre-IB, I wish I had done that!)<br>  Just a couple of pieces of advice, dont try to drown yourself with CAS hours because they will come to you, unless you already do a lot of extra curriculars you enjoy, thats okay. <br>  Anyways, to answer your question more directly, yes, IB is a lot of work, but if you choose subjects you enjoy I'm sure you'll still have a good time and I'm sure it'll pay off in the end<br>  Good luck to you!<br>  x

AA11043457	Some libraries have books and programs for learning languages.  Some even have speakers who tutor, especially in places like Florida.  Berlitz is a good program.  There are several.   Your Reference desk at the public library an help  you.  You can take classes at the JVS or at college but that is a bit slow.  Some of the disks are quite expensive.  Will your employer pay for part of the classes or reimburse you?  if  you are working now and you need to learn Spanish, most businesses would offer tuition reimbursement or help in learning.  Ask your HR person if they have recommendation and if the Company will assist with tuition reimbursement.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  It is a great opportunity.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	My friend had to go through this when she started teaching and it really annoyed her.|`|Ld27DABuaa	LEARN TO TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK AS WELL.

pX558YcIaa	I'm pretty sure it varies, but the basic idea is this:    A+ = 96% or higher  A = 93 - 95%  A- = 90 - 92%    B(including plus and minus) is in the eighties range, C is the in the seventies, and D in the sixties|`|WcuYfsWbaa	100=A+  99-90=A  89-80=B  79-70=C  69-60=D  59 and under=F|`|mbDp1IHuaa	101% & higher = A++  100% = A+  90-99 = A  80-89 = B  70-79 = C  60-69 = D  50-59 = F  50& lower = F-    i hope thats why you meant by percent haha.|`|j4PwaY5Jaa	87 or higher|`|YC3iLdKMaa	73-85% is B  86%-100% is A.|`|9SYEX2zEaa	A+ is over 100.
