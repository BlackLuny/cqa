I am 16 almost 17. and I AM SICK OF MY MOTHER!   she is getting annoying. she thinks all i do is play on the computer.   So here Is my deal. I need a hobby. to get away from her for a bit.   I cant take up Karate because she thinks its a "boys Sport" and i cant do it. i also cant take Wrestling(Which i love) for the same reason.      I do photography but am getting bored by it.

I use to be in soccer but i cant do soccer anymore for personal reasons.      any tips for what a 16 year old girl can do?   my friend suggested Karate and said its not to late. but I dunno if i could convince my mom to let me join it due to it being what she calls a "boys sport". any good ideas?

20090226190247AAm07rn	Games & Recreation;Other - Games & Recreation	Am I too old for Pokemon?	This is slightly embarrassing. I have a PSP and just downgraded it...and got a GBC emulator. Don't worry, I have the actual game in real life. I did so great on it that I didn't want to sell it and lose all my Pokemon.       Anyway, nearly 4 years later, I played Pokemon Gold and for some reason, as old as I am (14, turning 15 soon) I got very interested in the game and realized why I loved it in the first place. Recently I have had the urge to buy some Pokemon cards, but my sister will laugh at me, my mom will tell everyone she knows, my dad will shun me, and my friends will probably not give a crap. I'll fit in perfectly with all of the gay nerds (Yes, they are actually homosexual).       So...do you think I am too old for Pokemon? And is there an alternative, like a website that I can collect and trade cards on without the embarrassment in real life?

20090226173919AAM7kTw	Games & Recreation;Gambling	How likely is this poker losing streak on PokerStars?	I am a fairly solid sit'n'go player. I specialize in 6 max one table sit'n'go's with buyins ranging from $3.25 to $6.60. My return on investment typically hovers between ten and fifteen percent. I make the money in these games about 45% of the time with a good number of both second and first place finishes. Now, here is something that has me scratching my head:      In my last twenty 6 max sit'n'go's, I have cashed only once! Two money spots are available in each game out of six players and I just can't seem to get in there lately. Almost every coin flip in all of my key hands is not going my way. Lately, it seems if I move all in with my short stack and have the other player's ace dominated, he hits his kicker to bust me. This losing streak seems to defy mathematics but I'm not sure. I seriously think I'm playing solid poker but few things are going my way.      Does anyone have any idea what the heck is going on!?
