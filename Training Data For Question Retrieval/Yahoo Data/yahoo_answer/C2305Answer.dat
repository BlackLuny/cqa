GjtIXiK9aa	It is my dream to go to Ramsar on holiday, because I love nature and the beautiful jungle landscape.  I would take my best friend as it would be lonely if I went by myself.  I chose Ramsar because it still has unspoiled jungle, where I could experience such unforgettable moments as the music of the river and the jungle birds.  This is my dream holiday, but one day, I hope my dream will come true.

You could always try and persuade your class to try and persuade a big company or a bank to donate money towards your college and their courses. These ideas are of course short term but there's something to think about and hopefully will help you figure out what to write about.

yGOmMQP7aa	When you filled out your fafsa it asked you if you were interested in student loans.  You need to make sure this is marked "YES" on your fafsa.  After you apply for admissions and are accepted, your school will offer you federal Stafford loans to help defray the cost of your education.  Sometimes the financial aid office will require more paper work from you, so be sure and call them and have them send you everything you need.  Once all is turned in they will issue you an "Award Letter" detailing the exact amount of aid you are being offered.  You have the choice to either "Accept" or "Decline" what they are offering you.      Don't expect any federal or state grants, but you willl likely be offered a Unsubsidized stafford loan for 5,500 a year if you are a dependent freshman. Stafford loans require no cosigner and you don't have to pass a credit check.  You don't have to start paying it back until you graduate or drop out.    If you choose to go to a school that costs more than this you can also have your mom take out Parent PLUS loans.      Pay for your college and hold  your head up high!!! since you are paying for it yourself, you will be more likely to graduate and more likely to work in that field when you graduate..  Congratulations!!!|`|AA12021966	You will have to wait for the college's financial aid office to tell you what you are eligible for.

That's what I'm currently doing, meanwhile I'm looking for different scholarships, taking out a student loan would be a wise idea if you cannot qualify for a scholarship.

Dh0JX2Onaa	First calm down.Many do have problems with the math part of the GED, but most do pass the test.    You can take and should take a GED preparation class. They are available for free in many cases. They can be taken in your area by contacting your local high school or school district for a list of sites offering the course. You can also, if necessary take the preparation course on line.    Since you indicated that math was your major problem you will find below a number of sites that will help you prepare for the math GED./
fPavekfeaa	An introduction technically can be as long as you want it to be. Just make sure your not being too wordy with it. Does it need to be more than one paragraph to say what you need to say? Can you say what you need to say in just one paragraph? If you can say it in one paragraph you should. This is for any type of essay. If saying it in one paragraph takes away from what needs to be said to make your essay understood then leave it as two.<br>  <br>  I will say from experience however that it is incredibly rare for an essay to require more than one paragraph for introduction unless the essay is going to be more than 10 pages long.

W3UYWpxiaa	It's so much easier to start off super strict and then ease up, but since you are easy going already you are going to have to make the students see that you mean business.  You may have to lose the "laid back guy" attitude.  When you tell a student to do something mean it.  Don't be lax about it.  If they don't do what you ask follow through with some consequence.  If the kid shoots spit balls, give them a verbal warning and let them know that if they do it again that their break (or whatever you see fit) will be taken.  When they do it again take their break.  You can't give them another chance.  Speak assertively!  You should have an assertive and almost forceful tone that says, "I'm the boos and you better listen up."  <br>  <br>  It sounds almost like you're afraid that the kids won't like you.  Until you earn their respect you are going to have to put that on the side burner.  It may take sending a few to the office and making them not like you.  Once you get them to see that you mean business you can start to ease up a LITTLE BIT.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!

86PFQF4raa	(I LOVE YOU DARLING)<br>  <br>  The tooth fairy is a legendary good fairy who collects teeth as children lose them, offering coins in exchange. She is part of a large and complex cultural tradition of good and bad fairies, and children all over the world leave teeth for the tooth fairy in the hopes of seeing some money in the morning. In some cultures, instead of money, children receive a treat or a toy from the tooth fairy, with some spoilsport tooth fairies leaving presents like toothbrushes or floss to encourage children to take care of their budding adult teeth.<br>  <br>  Before delving into the story of the tooth fairy, you might be interested in hearing some background. Many cultures have a long history of superstition surrounding the loss of the milk teeth, the teeth which children use in their early years. In some societies, the loss of the milk or “baby” teeth is viewed as a rite of passage, with the loss of the teeth signaling a transition into adulthood. A history of performing some sort of ritual act with lost teeth is ancient.<br>  <br>  Tied in with beliefs about the loss of the milk teeth are beliefs about witchcraft. Many cultures used to believe (and some still do) that if a witch manages to obtain a part of someone's body, he or she can use that body part to perform black magic. Milk teeth would be a prime target for witches, along with things like fingernail clippings and scraps of hair. As a result, many cultures had a tradition of putting milk teeth into safekeeping to ensure that they would not enter the hands of witches.<br>  <br>  Historically, some people buried milk teeth, fed them to animals, or saved them so that they could keep an eye on them. As early as the 1600s, legends about fairies who collected baby teeth began to arise, but it wasn't until the early 1900s that people started leaving offerings for the tooth fairy. This good fairy is supposed to take care of lost milk teeth, ensuring that their owner grows up healthy and strong.<br>  <br>  The tradition of leaving money behind in exchange for a tooth also reflects very old beliefs about fairies. In English folklore especially, there is a long tradition of leaving gifts for fairies and receiving presents in return. The fairies are in a sense rewarding the people who offer them assistance, and in the case of the tooth fairy, the money is an expression of thanks for the tooth, and a reward for bearing the discomfort associated with losing milk teeth.|`|ihS1d5Ftaa	I really found above one interesting!!!!!!!

KOj8XOHPaa	Well, I don't know how much this would help, but here's what I do know:<br>  <br>  The story itself was set in and written during Depression Era California.  People were looking for work in this area, to no avail (in the near future, "Okies" would be a crude name for people from OK looking for a far distant better life in California).  Futures were uncertain.  A sense of "self" was hard to obtain.  Security was an idea that seemed too lofty to reach.  <br>  <br>  Steinbeck himself was somewhat of a hobo in the 1920's and also experienced the longing of the "American Dream," like Lenny and George did.  His experiences and the experiences of the majority of  Americans during the Depression definitely played a huge part in the writing of this novel.

4Ps1LBvoaa	i would cut it up:<br>  From the year 1861 to 1914, various Russians perceived the condition of the Russian peasantry as wretched and inequitable to others. Many people believed that the Russian peasants should be better educated, accumulate more land, escape the famine that surrounded their villages, and gain more rights for themselves.<br>  <br>  just so it separates it, a thesis can go on in more than one sentence, and your gonna want to talk about all of those things in your body of your intro paragraph, the thesis doesn't have to be so detailed, a more broad over statement of what you are arguing, then go int more detail in the body of your intro paragraph.|`|TklSZoy8aa	It looks like a good thesis that hits on the main points of the question.

WU70UwEWaa	think...Boy Scouts. <a href="http://scouts-honor.com/synopsis.html" rel="nofollow">http://scouts-honor.com/synopsis.html</a><br>  <br>  <br>  1.   A SCOUT'S HONOUR IS TO BE TRUSTED. If a scout says "On my honour it is so," that means it is so, just as if he had taken a most solemn oath. Similarly, if a scout officer says to a scout, "I trust you on your honour to do this," the Scout is bound to carry out the order to the very best of his ability, and to let nothing interfere with his doing so. If a scout were to break his honour by telling a lie, or by not carrying out an order exactly when trusted on his honour to do so, he would cease to be a scout, and must hand over his scout badge and never be allowed to wear it again. <br>  2. A SCOUT IS LOYAL to the King, and to his officers, and to his country, and to his employers. He must stick to them through thick and thin against anyone who is their enemy, or who even talks badly of them. <br>  3. A SCOUT'S DUTY IS TO BE USEFUL AND TO HELP OTHERS. And he is to do his duty before anything else, even though he gives up his own pleasure, or comfort, or safety to do it. When in difficulty to know which of two things to do, he must ask himself, "Which is my duty?" that is, "Which is best for other people?"---and do that one. He must Be Prepared at any time to save life, or to help injured persons. And he must do a good turn to somebody every day. <br>  4. A SCOUT IS A FRIEND TO ALL, AND A BROTHER TO EVERY OTHER SCOUT, NO MATTER TO WHAT SOCIAL CLASS THE OTHER BELONGS. If a scout meets another scout, even though a stranger to him, he must speak to him, and help him in any way that he can, either to carry out the duty he is then doing, or by giving him food, or, as far as possible, anything that he may be in want of. A scout must never be a SNOB. A snob is one who looks down upon another because he is poorer, or who is poor and resents another because he is rich. A scout accepts the other man as he finds him, and makes the best of him -- "Kim," the boy scout, was called by the Indians "Little friend of all the world," and that is the name which every scout should earn for himself. <br>  5. A SCOUT IS COURTEOUS: That is, he is polite to all--but especially to women and children and old people and invalids, cripples, etc. And he must not take any reward for being helpful or courteous. <br>  6. A SCOUT IS A FRIEND TO ANIMALS. He should save them as far as possible from pain, and should not kill any animal unnecessarily, even if it is only a fly---for it is one of God's creatures. <br>  7. A SCOUT OBEYS ORDERS of his patrol-leader, or scout master without question. Even if he gets an order he does not like, he must do as soldiers and sailors do, he must carry it out all the same because it is his duty; and after he has done it he can come and state any reasons against it: but he must carry out the order at once. That is discipline. <br>  8. A SCOUT SMILES AND WHISTLES under all circumstances. When he gets an order he should obey it cheerily and readily, not in a slow, hang-dog sort of way. Scouts never grouse at hardships, nor whine at each other, nor swear when put out. When you just miss a train, or some one treads on your favourite corn---not that a scout ought to have such things as corns--- or under any annoying circumstances, you should force yourself to smile at once, and then whistle a tune, and you will be all right. A scout goes about with a smile on and whistling. It cheers him and cheers other people, especially in time of danger, for he keeps it up then all the same. The punishment for swearing or bad language is for each offence a mug of cold water to be poured down the offender's sleeve by the other scouts. <br>  9. A SCOUT IS THRIFTY, that is, he saves every penny he can, and puts it in the bank, so that he may have money to keep himself when out of work, and thus not make himself a burden to others; or that he may have money to give away to others when they need it. <br>  <br>  These were written for the Scouts in the whole world, yet of course firstly focused on Scouting in the United Kingdom. As other groups started up Scouting organizations (often in other countries), each modified the laws, for instance 'loyal to the King' would be replaced by the equivalent text appropriate for each country.<br>  <br>  During the years, Baden-Powell himself edited the text numerous times, notably in 1911 adding:<br>  <br>  A SCOUT IS CLEAN IN THOUGHT, WORD AND DEED. Decent Scouts look down upon silly youths who talk dirt, and they do not let themselves give way to temptation, either to talk it or to do anything dirty. A Scout is pure, and clean-minded, and manly.|`|inZ9CWBiaa	I would assume that it came from the Scout Promise:<br>  On my honour, I will do my best to do my duty to my Queen and my country, to help other people and to live by the Scout Law.<br>  <br>  I may have missed some bits, and the American Boy Scout Promise is obviously different.<br>  <br>  The idea is that the Scout promise expects a high level of moral behaviour, so that if you say Scout's honor you are a Scout and therefore trustworthy, loyal etc

With these tips, the bell will ring before you know it!<br>  <br>  √ Think in color<br>  Writing notes is a great way to stay alert, but make things seems more intersting: Change pen colors every 30 minutes; write smaller, then larger; use cursive, then print. Breaking the period into sections makes time fly and helps you pay attention.<br>  <br>  √ Pop a mint<br>  Feel like you're about to doze off? Suck on peppermint candy. The taste is so strong, it literally wakes up your brain and gives you a boost of energy,<br>  <br>  √ Doodle<br>  You may think you're making mindless drawings, but creating scribbles that relate to your notes actually help your brain absorb the info. The visual aids will help you remember the material.<br>  <br>  √ Jot your thoughts<br>  Can't stop daydreaming? Get the distracting thoughts out of your head and onto paper- knowing you can deal with them later will gelp you focus more clearly on what the teacher is saying.<br>  <br>  √ Clean you desk<br>  When you take your chemistry textboox, algebra homework, and cell phone off your desk, there's nothing left to distract you. All the clutter makes it tough to concentrate because your mind has to work extra hard just to keep up with what's happening in class.<br>  <br>  √ Relate it to your life<br>  Connect what you're learning to something else in your life, so you're more engaged in the material.

You are tempted by parties, social interactions, sports, TV, movies and video games, dating and sex, booze, drugs, on-campus events and the like.  Add the pressure to have a part-time job (like I did) and it gets worse.  Most students are away from their parent's nagging for the first time and go 'way overboard with their new-found freedom and flunk out early.  My high-school class valedictorian died of a drug overdose her first two months of college.  The Homecoming queen flunked out in two quarters.  The captain of the football team didn't get picked for the squad.<br>  <br>  How to study?  First avoid the temptations as much as you can.  It's important to have the social experience in College.  It's a time you'll remember all your life.  Just remember what you're there for.<br>  <br>  Next:  Read the assignments.  Preferably before the class in which they will be discussed.  Do ALL your homework ON TIME EVERY TIME, and don't wait until the last minute to do it.  The harder the assignment, the earlier you should get started on it.<br>  <br>  You don't say what your major is.  Mine was physics and mathematics.  I prepared for tests by doing ALL the problems at the back of the chapters and looking up previous years tests on the same topic.  These are usually available in dorms, frats and student unions.  This works for any of the sciences or engineering, too.  For liberal arts, try supplemental readings, other books on the same topic.  Get used to being in the library looking up stuff.  And learn how to USE the library.  There is usually a good library course available.  Discussion groups.  Study buddies in the same class.<br>  <br>  Plan your study time so that you have time to get enough sleep.  It does no good to pull an all-nighter studying and then be so muzzy you can't think during the test.<br>  <br>  Always try to find out the WHY of what you are learning.  Once you find out the "why", the "what" becomes obvious.<br>  <br>  Talk to your instructors.   Most instructors are happy to have a student take a real interest in their class.  most of their students are just there because it's a requirement they have to fill.  If you're having trouble, go to office hours.  If it's something you're really interested in, ask to be involved in their research.  <br>  <br>  I never learned anything that hurt me, and A lot of stuff I learned has really helped out.  You are in college  not only to learn facts and maybe train for a profession, but most importantly, to learn how to THINK!<br>  <br>  It worked for me.  I have six college degrees, including a doctorate and three masters.  I've published six books and I've ended up moderately wealthy.  Oh, and by the way, I was a college professor for a few years, too.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	You just need to understand the grading philosophy of your instructor.  Look for 'freebie' points as I call them -- things like homework assignments, papers, participation, those sort of things there is NO reason you should not be earning A letter grades for them.  This is as you have all the time in the world and just need to put the right effort into getting them done.  <br>  <br>  In this manner you have accumulated enough points to cushion you on your exams where faltering a little will still get you that A grade for the course.<br>  <br>  In terms of the exam itself, learn how your instructor makes the exams.  Do they use 'gotcha' type questions or are they more generalized.  For example, some instructors basically want you to memorize chapters word for word.  In that case, you have no choice but to do that.  In others, just having the background familiarity is enough.  And for that matter, does the instructor only test on the book or lecture?  Or is it a combination of both?  Do not ignore either if you aren't sure!|`|cstW6JLIaa	Honestly, you have to devote more time per week than just the time spent sitting in class.<br>  <br>  Here are some of my own techniques I do to keep on the Dean's list:<br>  <br>  1. Go to the library at least one day a week, and set a timer for at least two hours. During those two hours, you can only be doing homework. But hey, you're already at the library, so what else is there to do anyway? :)<br>  <br>  2. Make every assignment/project seem like it will make or break your grade. There are so few graded assignments in college that if you screw up on one, it's hard to bounce back. Put the same amount of effort into each assignment you have.<br>  <br>  3. Don't overwork yourself. Taking on too many classes at once will affect your GPA. <br>  <br>  4. Balance your classes out. In your first semester or two, don't load your schedule with all the classes you like. Take one class in your area of study, then balance it with classes you may not like as much. So rather than taking History of Art, Sculpting, Painting, and Ceramics all in one semester, take Art, Math, English, and Science instead. That way, you're not stuck with all your least favorite classes at the end. It will keep you motivated.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|igkbUflbaa	Lock yourself in your room and study until you can't anymore.

AA11075358	Without seeing the instrument or you play its very hard to detail exactly whats wrong!  If it worked fine until you dropped it more than likely the key is bent and needs to be back in place. Only a little bend in the key can break the seal on the pads.

You are probably looking at a $20 ($30 at the most) job.  Even though it doesn't look like a key is bent, there most likely is a bent key that is not covering a hole properly.  It could be the register key, but that problem could be caused by other bent keys as well.  Take it to the repair shop.  If you're concerned about the price, ask for estimate.  Most shops will give you an estimated price before any work is done. <br>  <br>  Also, 1 1/2 is way too soft!  You need to play on at least the 2 1/2, and maybe a 3 (depending on the brand -- Vandoren's reeds tend to be harder per number).

KMqgfhAkaa	That depends on your idea of what a medium sized city is as well as what the "best" colleges are. But I would argue that good colleges are all over the place, regardless of city size. Granted, some of them are in the suburbs or outskirts of these "big" cities, but are still thought of as being in the greater area. Below are only a few of many schools I consider very strong academically that are in big cities:<br>  <br>  New York City: Columbia, NYU, Fordham, Brooklyn<br>  Boston: Harvard, BC, BU<br>  Atlanta: Emory<br>  Los Angeles: UCLA, Loyola, Pepperdine<br>  New Orleans: Tulane<br>  Miami: UMiami<br>  Chicago: UChicago, Northwestern, DePaul, Chi.-Kent<br>  St Louis: WashU, SLU<br>  San Francisco: Stanford, UC-Berkeley, UCal<br>  Nashville: Vanderbilt<br>  Baltimore: Johns Hopkins<br>  District of Columbia: Georgetown, American, GWash.<br>  <br>  There you go. Tons of great schools in BIG cities (even two Ivies, though I think Ivy is a very slowly declining spectacle). And there are plenty of great schools in smaller cities too. I just don't think there's much of a correlation between great school and city size. Hope that helps.|`|p31wNzO0aa	I think the reason is that if you have a large city then it would become even larger and possibly overcrowded with college kids and that would cause problems|`|AA10473272	What makes you think that larger US cities have the best colleges?  True, they have the most well-known colleges, but there are some excellent colleges in smaller cities.  I live in a city with a population of around 60,000 people, and we have one of the BEST engineering colleges in the US.  And, just about an hour south of us in another state, in a little town of 5,000, they have a college that has one of the best criminal justice programs leading to a Bachelor's degree in the nation.  So . . . it depends on what you are looking for.  Prestige . . . yes, very large cities.  A good education . . . some of the smaller cities do have very good colleges with a very good degree program.
ngQp1d9Daa	Honestly...You'll be fine. There aren't "pre-med" classes. There are classes you need to take within your major (ie. biology, chemistry) for medical school.<br>  But that said, definitely do biology and chemistry and physics. Calculus I took the AP (and got a 5) but actually had to take calc again in college for my major (and it was super easy).<br>  Don't wear yourself out taking classes at community college. Enjoy you're free time in high school while you can. I promise, it's not necessary, and you'll stress yourself out way too much. Colleges like to see you do other things besides *just* school work.

lQIKWXDuaa	"Gabriel (1776–October 10, 1800), today commonly if incorrectly known as Gabriel Prosser, was a literate enslaved blacksmith who planned and led a large slave rebellion in the Richmond area in the summer of 1800. Governor James Monroe and the state militia suppressed the rebellion. Gabriel and 26 other enslaved people who participated were hanged. In reaction, the Virginia and other legislatures passed restrictions on free blacks, as well as the education, movement and hiring out of the enslaved. In 2002 the City of Richmond passed a resolution in honor of Gabriel on the 202nd anniversary of the rebellion. In 2007 Governor Tim Kaine gave Gabriel and his followers an informal pardon, in recognition that history "favorably regarded" their willingness to fight for their freedom."<br>  <br>  Basically, he tested the laws of his time.

AA11434298	It was July 3rd, 1863, the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg.  It was a typical hot summer day. Hot and humid. We all knew what was going to happen. We could feel it in our blood, in our veins. We were shaking, trying not to let our nerves get to us. The southern troops were divided into the three divisions and I was part of Major General George Pickett's troop. Robert E. Lee had told him that we were to lead the assault and so the plan was later deemed "Pickett's Charge", though most of the commands were given by Lt. General James Longstreet. <br>  <br>  We started the infantry charge around one in the middle of an open field. Marching with about 12,000 men, I knew we all could feel the weight of the forecoming doom. When you're marching heart to heart, with the smell of gunpowder burning your nostrils and stinging your eyes, it's impossible not to feel the unending waves of emotion. Here we were, not even close to the Union line and already we were dropping one by one, whether it be from a cannon or from the intensity of the afternoon heat.<br>  <br>  STORY TO BE CONTINUED....|`|f005983d8c4908c03021a87774d6b3f5aa	Several years ago we took our four children to Gettysburg for a family vacation.  Before embarking on our journey, we stopped at Pickett's Charge, a restaurant close to our home, to fortify ourselves for the day's journey.  The day was warm and our car didn't have air conditioning in those days.<br>      When we got there we walked the battle fields and toured the museum.  We even found spent gun shells on the ground.  From reading the history, it was a particularly bloody war.  Oddly people came as spectators to the war, considering it a day's outing, never expecting it to be so horrific.  Reading the history, you could almost smell the gunpowder.  We viewed the uniforms of the northern and southern troops.  The outcome of the war was grim for the north moving the union line farther northward.<br>      As an interesting side line, I just read in the newspaper that they are tearing down the observation tower there.  I think that the idea is that it interferes with the viewing of the battlefields as they actually were.<br>  <br>  <br>  The above is pretty much true, we even have a restaurant by that name in our area.  Hope you like this better than my last effort.  <br>                                                         Susan|`|afccac613f0e39a32a7c14e40cec9291aa	The mercury read 110 degrees in Gettysburg -- definitely unusual and not the kind of day for the southern troops to be rallying outside the newspaper office. Things were certainly hot enough inside given the outrageous deception being sold as truth.<br>  <br>  The union line's pickets carried bold signs with calls for TRUTH and voices both in unison and in tandem began chanting their demands. The tension was palpable. This was not just another hot summer day!<br>  <br>  As the numbers of marchers outside increased, bystanders gathered -- cheering and adding to the chaos. The local gendarmes had been called but hadn't yet arrived. <br>  <br>  Suddenly, from who knows where, a shot rang out and the smell of gunpowder filled the acrid air. This was enough to to make the pickets charge in all directions, signage strewn everywhere.

Every school has a "common course curriculum" number to ensure transferability of all of your courses.  This is for students who start out at community college and then go to a 4 year University.  Also for any classes you want to take at a community college that are less difficult there, than at your university and you want to transfer the credit.  One thing I do know is that the credit will count towards your degree but they won't count towards  your GPA.  And, most colleges require you to take a certain number of credits at their school so some of your courses may transfer but you still have to take more classes because you transferred.  Lots of info, hope it's helpful.

AA10357611	The author is using the poem to tell the reader about her children (4 boys, 4 girls); she compares them to birds leaving her nest, just as humans say that their children are "leaving the nest" once they grow older, get a job, move out, get married, etc.  Her mood, I would say, is contemplative, wistful, but overall positive.  She's not saying that it's a bad thing that her little birds, or children really, are leaving the nest; she simply wants them to be happy, successful and out of harm's way.  She reminds her little birds to be weary of their safety, for example.  In the end, she explains that she is most happy when all is "well with you," you meaning her children.  I will say, however, that this is just MY take on the poem.  The above explanation is how I understood it, not necessarily the correct answer you might be searching for.|`|CKSbgaU5aa	its a deeply moving metaphore. the author is speaking of the anguish and anxiety a parent feels when a child leaves home to start a life of their own, but also the pride. This, relating to birds, teaching their young to fly, and soon taking flight forever. but this is also the fear of a parent's that the young will never come back. A truly beautiful poem. GOOD LUCK!

QLlqbTelaa	I don't think it's the best idea.  It's almost like you are rewarding them for paying attention.  And if it's suppose to come before the presentation, you are basically just giving them some questions for your motivational activity.  <br>  <br>  Have you seen the film Cinderella Man?  It's a very dramatic look at life during the Great Depression.  Maybe you could show the class the scene where Russell Crowe's son steals a salami because the family is starving, and he makes him take it back.  Most people in America have no idea what hunger is like, but that was the harsh reality for millions during that time period.  There was no Govermental safety net in those days, so no work meant no food on the table...<br>  <br>  Continued....<br>  <br>  <br>  You'll have to spend a little money at Blockbuster on the day of the presentation, but you also need to see it before to make sure it's what you want.  It will be a good insight into your project too.  Of course you'll need a DVD player in the class room, and you'll have to set it up in advance to the precise location on the disc you want to play.  I'm sure the class would enjoy 5 minutes of this excellent movie.  What the heck, you can even give them some candy while it's playing!|`|4QmfFDN7aa	look on the internet|`|AA10147747	Create an imaginary town. Make cards up for each person in your class.  On them give each person a name (or you could make teams within the classroom) and a description of who each person is (widowed farmer with 8 kids, bank owner, investor, house maid, lumberjack, hotel owner etc.) and dream up the situation...run on the bank, investment market takes a dive, no one can afford to buy the farmers crops etc. <br>  Give a presentation of what happened during the depression. Ask people in the class to write about what they would do faced with the situation.  Forty percent of farms were repossessed, kids had to quit going to school so they could try to find work, rich people were suddenly poor, whole families found themselves homeless and walking to labor camps.  Hard working people were reduced to the shame of standing in soup lines and begging for work. Maybe they could sort of understand what life was like for a lot of  people then.

"Why isn't a preposition generaly used with 'last'?" Because its the english language...it can do that [make exeptions etc]|`|9z6WBH1Kaa	Last is an adjective.  You don't use a preposition with an adjective. The preposition goes with the NOUN.<br>  <br>  We visited the site last Tuesday.  Last Tuesday is an adverbial phrase telling when you VISITED, not a prepositional phrase at all.<br>  <br>  Thank you for the party last night.  For goes with the noun party.  Last night is separate.  It tells when the party was, and is an implied adverbial phrase for (which was) last night, and the last night goes with WAS. <br>  <br>  Thank you for last night's party. For goes with party. Last is an adjective describing night, and night is an adjective describing party.  Again, the preposition goes with the noun, never with last.

As originally conceived, the ideal model of a charter school as a legally and financially autonomous public school (no tuition, religious affiliation, or selective student admissions) that would operate much like a private business – free from nonessential state laws and district regulations, and accountable more for student outcomes rather than for processes or inputs (such as Carnegie Units and teacher certification requirements).[1]

H5s3TaG3aa	One thing to remember when preparing countries is that American students accept ALL of their students.  Other countries do not.  Special education for students with learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and mental retardation for the most part doesn't exist - especially in the same school.  Other countries also require parents to pay (big motivator for parents to pay attention to their kids & an economic divider to weed out poor families) and students are often required to PASS tests to move on to the next level.   Until No Child Left Behind came along, this was not the case...kids were passed on without much though.<br>  <br>    In other words, students in other countries taking these exams are motivated (by parents if not intrinsically) and these exams are only given to the top 20 percent or so.  Our exams are given to any in pursuit of a high school diploma...which is statistically speaking 98 percent or more of a school's population.  (Less than about two percent are in pursuit of a certificate of attendance due to a more severe disability.)|`|UbN9Fss0aa	i think Israel is slightly above avrage but not by much|`|atThb0O0aa	They are applying expectations . . . It's amazing what a child will learn if the parent's expect them to . . . It starts when a child is young . . . if a parent expects a toddler to behave, then he does . . . if the child is expected to eat vegetables, then he does. . .  if a child is expected to speak a foreign language before graduating elementary school then he will.  Our standards are entirely too low!

AA11809083	Second Roman emperor, who reigned throughout Jesus' adult years. When Tiberius Claudius Nero was only three [39 BCE], Octavian [Augustus] fell in love with his beautiful mother [Livia] & ordered his father to divorce her so that he could marry her. Six years later Octavian brought Tiberius & his younger brother into his own household, after Tiberius' biological father died [33 BCE]. A serious, introverted youth, Tiberius was not popular in Rome but won admiration & public praise for several military victories on the frontiers. So, when Augustus' colleague Agrippa died [12 BCE], the emperor married Tiberius to Agrippa's widow: Augustus' own daughter, Julia. Their incompatibility & Julia's blatant infidelity, however, led Tiberius to abandon her & go into voluntary exile without the emperor's consent [6 BCE]. But his mother Livia exposed Julia's adultery to Augustus. So the puritanical emperor, who had himself drafted laws outlawing adultery, was forced to send his own daughter into permanent exile [4 BCE].  <br>  <br>  After the death of Augustus' oldest grandson, Livia finally persuaded Augustus to recall Tiberius & pardon him. When Augustus' 2nd grandson died [4 CE], he was forced to adopt his stepson, change his name to Tiberius Julius Caesar, & designate him as his heir. Tiberius proved himself worthy of command by a decisive victory over the Germans who had devastated the Roman legions under Varus [9 CE]. When he finally became emperor [at age 57], he administered the state with Spartan economy & military discipline. He trusted soldiers & thus was able to establish a stable military administration in the provinces. But his distrust of Roman aristocrats led him to concentrate power in the Praetorian guard [the imperial police] & to set up a system of informers designed to intimidate the Senate. As a result many Romans were sentenced & executed on rumors. <br>  <br>  At age 65 [23 CE], after the death of his only son [Drusus], Tiberius lost all interest in governing & put the head of the Praetorian guard [Lucius Sejanus] in charge of Rome. He retired to Capri [27 CE] for a life of self-indulgence & sadistic pleasures. But fearing he had abdicated too much power to the ambitious Sejanus [who had married his son's widow], he charged him & his wife with his son's murder & ordered their execution [31 CE]. The last six years of his life, Tiberius orchestrated a reign of terror in which informers were paid for denouncing prominent Roman citizens [including relatives of the emperor]. The whole Jewish community was (temporarily) expelled from Rome. Anyone who was accused was subjected to torture & execution without further proof. <br>  <br>  Since few members of the imperial family were qualified to succeed him, Tiberius chose his wife's grandson, Gaius Caligula, whom he compared to a viper. But he imprisoned Herod's grandson Agrippa just for prematurely wishing that Caligula was already emperor. At age 79, the perverse emperor was beginning to recover from a shoulder injury when the head of his own Praetorian bodyguard suffocated him. His military & administrative achievements left Rome more prosperous & more secure than when he had become emperor. But his ultimate legacy was the creation of the police state.|`|1bef88c152301de5736c13a03f8d6a89aa	if its your brothers project  why are you doing it for him.......

784ddeff8a8bc634f0203b79d9946655aa	El ni?o abusado ha sido víctima de violencia y por lo tanto esta situación siempre deja secuelas en su psiquis que deben ser tratadas para evitar trastornos futuros. El abuso sexual no necesariamente inclina al ni?o a la homosexualidad. Cada caso es diferente y las consecuencias que tenga la violación dependerá de muchas circunstancias, el tiempo que el ni?o ha sido abusado ( si fue una ocasión única o fue en repetidas oportunidades) , quien fue el abusador ( un desconocido o algún familiar o persona cercana) si pudo ponerl en palabras lo sucedido, es decir si pudo contar lo que le ocurrió o lo guardó para sí durante mucho tiempo por temor o vergüenza, si contó con apoyo psicológico, si su entorno creyó en el ni?o y lo apoyó para que supere su trauma etc, etc. Como ves hay un sin numero de situaciones que deben ser evaluadas en caso de un abuso sexual a un ni?o y el impacto que este hecho de violencia tenga en su psiquis siempre va a tener que ser evaluado de modo subjetivo, no  es posible generalizar pues cada individuo es único e irrepetible.

Por lo tanto...tambien éstas causan da?os y lesiones morales al comportamiento normal de cualquier persona, algunas de ellas despues tienen que estimularse viéndo imágenes para sentir mayor placer, a ir con prostitutas, tomar vicios como el alcohol, las drogas..etc....dejando de ser "normales y automáticos".....EVITAR LAS TENTACIONES,... ayudar a otros, haciendo ejercicios, tareas y con una buena lectura formativa. .....Responde a tí mismo...nunca volviste a ser el mismo al masturbarte, que cuando eras un joven inocente y casto.

bs8T1ilaaa	Noah Webster wrote the first American dictionary in 1806. I'm sure, though that there were other dictionaries before that.|`|AA10485805	Lexicography is an ancient occupation; dictionaries of many sorts were produced in China, Greece, Islam, and other complex early cultures. The 13th-century Dictionarius of John of Garland is the first recorded use of the term to mean word list. Nathan Bailey (d. 1742) was the author of three English dictionaries so much more comprehensive and consistent than any of their predecessors as rightly to be considered the first examples of modern lexicography. His Universal Etymological English Dictionary was published in 1721; his larger dictionary, Dictionarium Britannicum, was published in 1730. An interleaved copy of this larger work was used by Samuel Johnson in preparing the two-volume Dictionary of the English Language, which appeared in 1755. Johnson's definitions evince his scholarship, humor, judgment, and skill and are basic to later lexicography. William Kenrick, who published a dictionary in 1773, was first to indicate pronunciation with diacritical marks (see accent) and to divide words according to their syllables. The dictionary of Thomas Sheridan (1721–88), an actor, was published in 1780, and the dictionary of John Walker (1732–1807), also an actor, in 1791. In both these dictionaries special care was given to pronunciation, as to which, for many years, Walker's authority received more deference than it merited.

Norman Schwartzkoff (sp?) of the first Gulf War fame had a really high IQ, but I don't know if it topped my uncle's.|`|J7V9d1x7aa	In the US, 85% of the population has an IQ in the range of 90-110, so 122 is at about the 93rd percentile, with 100 being the 50th percentile for the US population. Definitely above average, although that depends on the tests' standard deviation.

If he means Achilles, I think he's wrong.  Achilles commits slaughter, which leads to his downfall.  There can be little sympathy for him, and I don't think Homer intended that we feel any sympathy toward him.<br>  <br>  I would agree that the epic poem does leave us with the feeling of cleansing and purgation, but it is not affected by pity and fear.  Instead, it is brought about by looking at the tragic hero, pondering the why of his downfall and resolving ourselves not to fall prey to such temptation in our lives.

He was a Marine in Vietnam and had seen many people killed and lived and survived in the jungle through 2 tours of service. He was in charge of a crew of rough guys who respected him. He was over 6 ft tall and commanded respect. Yet, his dream was to become a kindergarten teacher. I never new this until he checked out through my office and I signed his retirement papers. As I handed them back to him, I asked him what he was going to do with his retirement. He informed me that he had already been accepted in college for the alternative teaching program and was going to start in 2 weeks. He said that he wanted to make a difference in the world and the best way he could think of doing this was to start with children in school. I did some follow up on him and found out that he did achieve his dream.

I left there 3 years later with qualifications and a set of tools and at that point in time i moved to another place to live where no one knew me and got a job as a joiner on a building site and after five years rose to the heady hights of forman ( of coarse i never let on i was epileptic) so i got better money and respect, and if i felt ill i had an office i could retire to without being missed, but i never lost site of my dream to open a workshop making furniture, i bought derilict houses to convert and sell in my spare time and eventualy i realised my dream twenty years on, but i must point out i never after being sacked did a job i did not like doing so 95% of my life has been spent chasing my dreams and it still goes on today, i alway try to aproach anything i do with the attitude that nothing is impossible, only improbable? so please don't sit and dream your life away, just live your dreams because you are a long time dead? but most of all be happy in whatever you do, "so don't stop playing or you will get old"

Chronique de Claude Weill<br>  <br>  Du mauvais usage d'un martyr<br>  (extraits)<br>  Quant aux historiens, ils avouent leur perplexité. Sans doute, comme on le dit à l'Elysée, Guy M?quet est une belle image de la jeunesse, du courage et de l'engagement. Une victime exemplaire de la barbarie nazie et de l'ignominie vichyste. Mais s'il s'agit d'incarner le combat de la Résistance, le choix prête à discussion. Quand on prétend faire oeuvre de pédagogie, il faut se méfier des anachronismes. Guy M?quet adhère au PCF en 1939, au moment où son père, Prosper, est déchu de son mandat de député et bient?t emprisonné pour avoir refusé de condamner le pacte germano-soviétique. Lui-même est arrêté en octobre 1940, non par les Allemands, mais par la police de Vichy. Non pour fait de résistance contre l'occupant, mais sur la base du décret Daladier de 1939 portant ? dissolution des organisations communistes ?. Ce n'est pas faire injure à sa mémoire que de le rappeler, et il serait absurde d'en faire grief à un enfant de 17 ans : à l'été 1940, le PCF déchiré entre ses sentiments patriotiques et l'allégeance à Moscou (qui a adressé à Berlin ses ? plus chaudes félicitations ? pour les ? succès splendides des forces armées allemandes ?, n'appelle pas, pas encore, à combattre l'Allemagne. C'est à l'été 1941, après l'invasion de l'URSS par la Wehrmacht, qu'il s'engage dans la lutte armée contre l'occupant. Le 20 octobre 1941, à Nantes, un jeune communiste, Gilbert Brustlein, abat le général Hotz. Guy M?quet et ses camarades sont livrés par Vichy et exécutés comme otages. L'historiographie communiste n'aura de cesse de faire oublier les errements de 1939-1941. Et le drame de Chateaubriant a joué un r?le clef dans cette réécriture de l'histoire, qui visait à antidater l'entrée du PCF en résistance, en faisant des martyrs du 22 octobre 1941, dont beaucoup avaient été arrêtés dès l'automne 1939, les pionniers de la lutte contre l'hitlérisme.<br>  Tout cela est du passé. Nous ne sommes plus dans le temps des héros mais dans celui de l'histoire. Hors de tout jugement moral - au demeurant, le PC n'a certes pas à rougir de son comportement pendant la guerre -, il importe aujourd'hui d'expliquer. Or si la lettre de Guy M?quet qui sera lue le 22 octobre dans les lycées de France est bouleversante, son apport historique est mince. Elle ne dit rien de son engagement, de son idéal de jeune communiste, rien du contexte. On voit mal ce que cette lecture peut susciter chez des lycéens d'aujourd'hui, sinon une bouffée d'émotion, un moment de communion patriotique, émotionnel et a-historique.

Tant qu'à l'utliser dans un cours d'histoire géo sur la période, ce n'est pas la plus intéressante pour expliquer la vie sous l'occupation ou l'action des mouvements de résistance. Elle n'est pas dans les manuels à cause de sa "pauvreté" à ce propos.|`|f98e36ae9fe5ef5b717d04c3b9faeeb1aa	Ils ont raison. Il faut laisser la liberté pédagogique aux enseignants.

If you don't understand the paragraph, read it again. I suggest that you try this once and try it way before the test day so you have time. Read each page, when you are done reading a page ask yourself do I understand it? If not, read it again. Then when you are done reading anything you need to read, go back and scan everything and take notes while you are doing it. Scanning is when you read but you aren't concentrating as hard and not reading everything quite word for word. <br>  <br>  I also suggest you do this everyday. When you have learned something that day in class go over it again. If you are on a chapter in class go home and read that chapter like I told you to above and take notes. Look over your notes everyday! You will seriously get an A+ that way and if you do it often you become very fast at it!|`|4GuAt4v8aa	take the books and obviously read them. anything important or something you have to know just write down. then read it twice, then copy it down and read it aloud. then see if you can make a little test with leaving out the important words and key concepts and then do something else for a while, go back to it and fill it out then grade yourself.<br>  <br>  hope it helps!|`|cl7yAWJgaa	study for an hour and then take a short break, or even better take like a 20 min nap. if you do this then your brain will have time to process the information. sleep is best though, or so i learned in my psychology class...if you do too much at once its like an information overload. so make a schedule and break things up, and relax...you could just be psyching yourself out :)|`|MWgd8KMRaa	Summarize what you read<br>  <br>  Picture what you read, for example, if you read about the war of 1812, just picture yourself there as you read along.<br>  <br>  After each paragraph, paraphrase what you just read, then explain to yourself what you just read.<br>  |`|DJiUN0FSaa	Read it slower and think about it as your reading it youll comprehend it better|`|0l1EYro2aa	well what i do when im reading and i dnrt know what the **** im reading i usually go back and read it over |`|hjKdEw49aa	Take lots of notes, highlight key words that you think or know will be on the test.|`|yCYTgjBmaa	Try to link key words together.|`|GtJiXYDvaa	lol ^^^^|`|gDfMpbTGaa	what?|`|3llEBKnEaa	wright it this time, and stick it to ur forhead.

b1gBoizMaa	Oui, à partir du moment où tu as une licence, tu peux postuler. ?a peut être intéressant pour aussi conna?tre le métier et savoir s'il te pla?t avant de te lancer dans le CAPES ou autre. C'est ce que j'ai fait. Au moins, après en avoir bavé pour avoir le concours, je savais ce qui m'attendait et je savais que c'était un métier qui me plaisait. Mais, il faut faire gaffe à ne pas tomber dans le piège des remplacements pendant 10 -  15 ans. Parce que malgré tout, on est vachement moins bien payé alors qu'on fait le même boulot. On n'est pas payé pendant les vacances et lorsqu'on ne bosse pas. On est le bouche-trou de l'éducation nationale... C'est bien pour payer ses études mais j'ai des copains qui galèrent au bout de 10 ans de remplacements vacataires et qui n'arrivent pas à s'en sortir. Je pense qu'il ne faut pas tarder ensuite à passer le concours si c'est ce qu'on veut faire.|`|93785b366db54a29de3e8e1dd01f8932aa	Moi non plus mais c"est bien de le savoir, comme quoi on en apprends tous les jours<br>  MERCI|`|AFUaFPRfaa	Le statut et la paie ne doivent pas etre equivalents !|`|LAZRQ86uaa	Bien s?r que oui.

Après, si tu as le concours tu seras titulaire, sinon tu seras rempla?ant. Par contre dans ces cas là, aucune garantie d'avoir un poste d'une année sur l'autre, ou même d'une semaine à l'autre.

i6RHI18Paa	EVERYTHING!<br>  <br>  Capitalism helps supplies the needs for EVERY part of society. I am going to simplify it, but you should get the gist of a capitalistic society. <br>  <br>   For instance, say you are a farmer. You don't have anyway to build a new tractor, but you need a new one for the upcoming year. The guy that sells tractors cant build them either, but he knows you need one, and his wife needs money for groceries. The guy that builds tractors doesn't have time to sell them, and his wife want money for groceries as well. Finally, the grocer's shelves need to be stocked so he can sell some items and pay his employees each week. He calls you the farmer to order some produce and meat to put on his shelves. Ok, got it so far? Here we go. Remember, you're the farmer. <br>  <br>  <br>  The grocer calls you and wants some produce and meat for his store right now, and for the next year. You tell the guy that sells tractors you need a new one in order to get the crops in for the grocer next year. The guy that sells them tells the guy that builds them to build him one. The builder says give me $400 and I will build you one new tractor. The seller says you need to give him $500 to get a tractor. You say you'll be right back. You go to the grocer and sell $500 of your produce and meat. <br>  <br>  You take the $500 to the seller. The seller gives $400 to the builder and $100 to his wife. The seller gives you a new tractor. The grocer sells $100 dollars worth of groceries to the seller's wife, and $100 worth to the builder's wife as well. <br>  <br>  This is really an oversimplification, but I am sure you get my point. In a nutshell that's capitalism, which is the best for everyone. America has proven this to the whole world for four centuries.|`|NzYBmDP7aa	try here<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism</a>|`|b8wHNBenaa	The rich can get richer and prosper.

r6rRAJ0waa	A. First, find the slope of the line. The equation for this is:<br>  y(two) - y(one)  /  x(two) - x(one)<br>  -4 +1  /  6+3<br>  The slope of the line is -3/9 which reduces to -1/3<br>  <br>  Now you have to find the y-intercept.<br>  To do this, plug x and y from one of the points and the slope we just firgured out into the slope intercept form equation.<br>  <br>  y=mx+b<br>  -1= -3/9(-3) +b<br>  <br>  Then solve for b<br>  <br>  -1=1+b<br>  -2=b<br>  <br>  Final Answer:<br>  <br>  y= -3/9x -2 or -1/3x-2<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  B. This is basically the same thing. Parallel lines have the same slopes but different y-intercepts. So we just need to find that different y-intercept.<br>  <br>  Plug the points into the equation along with the slopes and solve for b once again.<br>  <br>  y=mx+b<br>  2= -3/9(-6) +b<br>  2= 2+b<br>  0=b<br>  <br>  Final Answer=<br>  y= -3/9x or -1/3x<br>  <br>  C. Perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes. So now we plug the x and y in again to find the y-intercept, but change the slope to 9/3 or 3.<br>  <br>  y=mx+b<br>  2= -1(3) + b<br>  2= -3 + b<br>  5=b<br>  <br>  Final Answer:<br>  y= 3x + 5|`|RBbPRUzwaa	A)    slope=m<br>  m=Y1-Y2/X1-X2 or  Y2-Y1/X2-X1<br>  so(-3,-1) and (6,-4)<br>  m=(-1--4)2 negatives make a positive so -1+4 / -3-6<br>  m=3/-9 reduce it down to -1/3<br>  B)  1/3x+1<br>  C) 3x+4|`|RmnJQp1Laa	a.) m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)<br>  = (-4 - -1) / (6 - -3)<br>  = -3 / 9<br>  = -1/3<br>  so slope [m] = -1/3<br>  y = mx + b<br>  -4 = (-1/3) * 6 + b<br>  -4 = -2 + b<br>  -2 = b<br>  ...so therefore the equation is y = (-1/3)x - 2<br>  <br>  b.) slope is same (-1/3) so do<br>  y = mx + b<br>  2 = (-1/3) * (-6) + b<br>  2 = 2 + b<br>  0 = b<br>  so equation is y = (-1/3)x<br>  <br>  c.) slope is negative reciprocal of (-1/3) so slope = 3<br>  use y = mx + b again with new slope and point (-1, 2)<br>  2 = 3 * (-1) + b<br>  2 = (-3) + b<br>  5 = b<br>  so equation is y = 3x + 5|`|JhyJALlPaa	a) y= -1/3x(the variable) - 2<br>  b) y= 1/3x + 1<br>  c) y= 3x+4<br>  <br>  i don't know if those are absolutely correct cuz i havent taken algebra since last year. the only other person you could trust is probably a math professor.

Both started at tech/trade schools and DeVry has really come along.<br>  <br>  Howerever!  both are private schools and will cost you big bucks.  DeVry is around $56,000 for a BS degree.

4nKdUcyLaa	You may want to consider something that will fill a humanities requirement, like an into to music or art history class. I took a critical thinking class that was very easy and had little homework. These types of classes should be less time consuming than a studio art class. If you took a foreign language in high school, that might not be a bad choice either, assuming you feel confident that you will have little trouble in the class. Ultimately, I would suggest finding a subject you have an interest in and taking its "Into" class. Don't take a class just because it's easy if you have no interest in it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
LAZRQ86uaa	Etant enseignante en LAP, je peux te dire que mes étudiants viennent de beaucoup d'horizons différents: certains ont des BTS ( commerce, PME PMI management ou autre) d'autre ont des DEUG, des licence voire maitrise de lettres, langues, mathématiques...donc pourquoi pas toi, la seule chose est la motivation et le travail: il y a pas mal de droit et de culture générale en LAP et comme pour tout, il faut travailler avec régularité .<br>  Certains de mes étudiants ( qui n'avaient pas à la base une formation en droit) ont très bien réussi leur LAP et vont intégrer un Master en droit à la rentrée<br>  <br>  Si tu as des questions, contacte moi

AA10858028	Me and my siblings been to Sylvan. It costs like 75 an hour. Its good if your a little kid, but if you're over the age of... I dunno... maybe the age of 13, its complete crap unless you happen to get a really good tutor, but a good tutor is a dime a dozen. I was lucky that when I went for algebra, I had the best algebra tutor ever. After that, my tutors were really cool, but nothing great. Especially reading and study skills. I got a crush on my math tutor because he was actually a philosophy professor and I liked talking to him. lol<br>  <br>  But anyway... its good for little kid because you get tokens and if you save up enough tokens you can get a cool prize but when you're older, you don't care about those prizes as much.

It shows plenty of maps and models of several camps and explains them in detail.  <br>  <br>  |`|CLOtMCwSaa	Well, I just came back from Germany, I am in the US Army. We refurnished alot of the buildings that Hitler used to house his troops. But more or less, they were buildings with really big rooms, I couldnt say exactly how big, but enough to put about two or three people in comfortably. They had anywhere from 3 to 5 story buildings. With community showers and restrooms. About 5-8 people could take a shower at the same time. Couldnt really say much else except that they used to have an underground motorpool where we used to be at, we never used it, but it was cool to go down there, and just have a look around. Hope that helps.|`|XSu3dedGaa	Don't draw a picture they'll be expecting to see. Gas showers, marches, illness, depression are all expected in the camps. <br>  <br>  The holocaust wasn't just about the death camps and the people in them. There were the people hiding all over Europe (like Anne Frank and her family), there were soldiers who refused to do Hitler's dirty work, there were politicians watching death happen all over the world and not being able to stop it, there were parents watching their children going to war and not coming back.<br>  <br>  Draw a picture about one of these, originality gets you more marks that something they're expecting. I drew a picture of the people getting on the train, not knowing where they were going, the children excited, the parents keeping an eye on the children, grandparents laughing and playing with their grandchildren etc as they got on the train. But at every door of the train was a sinister looking SS soldier.

x1VLBHOJaa	The global world made Americans realize how other countries prepare education for math and science. Jobs that are requiring science or engineering training will rise. In China 500,000, and in India 200,000 engineers graduated in 2004. The USA had 70,000 engineer graduates. Taking China as an example, they have a strong school curriculum and try to make math and science the standard subjects. This is why Chinese students are among the top students in math and science. On April 25, 2007, US senators passed the bill called as S. 761, the America Competes Act. This was an important bill for education because it included important issues about education relating to math and science. The legislation focuses on three primary areas to improve American competitiveness in the 21st Century. It highlights this; first, increasing research investment which will strengthen educational opportunities in science and technology. Second, the engineering and mathematics from elementary through graduate school, and the last thing is developing an infrastructure that will enhance innovation and competitiveness in the United States. This bill shows that math and science, and efforts to support these subjects, are vital in keeping Americans educationally competitive. As I see it, the government puts a lot of effort into developing the educational program of math and science and through this bill, the American government hopes that it will be impacted on education and lead to a solid foundation of math and science.    P.S. What is all this for? I'd love to know what marks I'm getting for your grammar homework
a01a4c7fa42d359ddf53eaa686c7f84faa	Use the quotient rule.       If y = f (g)/f (h), then y' = [f (h) f '(g) - g (g) f '(h)]/ [f (h)]2.  Then just plug in the numbers.    f (g) = 3  f '(g) = 0, since 3 is a constant    f (h) = x  f '(h) = 1  f' '(y) = [x (0) - 3 (1)]/x2 = (-3/x2).    Now just plug x = 2 into the last equation:    f '(y) = [-3/(2)2]  f '(y) = -3/4.    Here is another way to find the instantaneous rate of change.  Note that 1/x = x^-1.  Then y = 3/x = 3 (1/x) = 3x^-1, and the instantaneous rate of change, using the product rule, is y' = 3 [-1 (x-2)] = -3x-2 = -3/x2.  Then just plug in x = 2, and y' = -3/(2)2 = -3/4.|`|LVPNuEsLaa	If you are in calculus, the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the derivative at that point, so:    d(f(x))/dx = d(3*x^-1)/dx = -3*x^-2 = -3/x^2.  At x=2, this equals -3/4    If you are not in calculus, the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the slope of the plot at that point, so evaluate the formula at points a and b very close to 2 (say, a=1.9 and b=2.1 or closer).  Then:    slope = rise/run = dy/dx = (f(b)-f(a)) / (b - a)    This is less accurate, but gets more accurate the closer you are to the actual point (so use 1.999 and 2.001).

HlMVrIP4aa	1) A friend's dad made him copy the contents of an encylopedia onto paper - by hand. His Dad's intention was for my friend to keep on writing until he understood it. Maybe you can copy data - by hand - onto paper. Then, when done, try reading it to see if you yourself would understand what you had written. Then, let others read it to see if they understand it as well.<br>  <br>  2) I also recommend this (from a site):<br>  <br>  Time Required: 1-2 weeks<br>  Here's How:<br>  <br>  Open a word processing program and write a sentence containing about ten words using a variety of letters.<br>  Copy the sentence and paste it about five times.<br>  Look through the fonts to find styles that you like. Change the font of each copied sentence so you end up with a variety of choices. Look over the styles and pick the style you like best.<br>  Once you come up with a handwriting style you’d like to emulate, type out the entire alphabet in your word processor, using your font of choice. Use a large type size and leave plenty of spaces between letters and lines. Save this page so you can print several copies, as needed.<br>  Practice writing the letters. Keep your feet flat on the floor, don’t slouch, and rest your elbows on the desk or table as you write. Make sure your entire arm moves as you write—not just your hand.<br>  Create several sentences to form a new style guide.<br>  One you get the hang of your writing style, start practicing in a journal every day.<br>  Keep a printed style guide on hand as you do your homework.<br>  <br>  3) And form another site:<br>  <br>  Step1<br>  Diagnose your major penmanship problems. Many people who are troubled by their cramped, stilted writing are actually finger writers. They draw the letters with their fingers and pick up their hand as it moves across the page.<br>  Step2<br>  Practice writing a paragraph. The forearm and shoulder should move as you write. If your fingers are doing most of the work, you can re-train your muscles with conscious effort to the task.<br>  Step3<br>  Notice how you are holding your pen. The most effective way is to hold the pen between the thumb and index finger with the barrel of the pen resting on the middle finger. The other fingers should curl under the hand. Other ways of holding a pen are okay, but may not be as comfortable as this method.<br>  Step4<br>  Balance the pen lightly in your hand. Ease up if you doesn't feel comfortable or you feel tension.<br>  Step5<br>  Make sure you are comfortably sitting at a table or flat surface with plenty of room for your arm to move as you write. Pay attention to your posture.<br>  Step6<br>  Start writing right at the position that you are holding your pen on the paper. With fingers nearly straight, write slightly above and between your thumb and index finger. Don't curl your hand or try to write to the left. Let your arm and shoulder muscles do the work.<br>  Step7<br>  Move the paper up to the place on the table that first felt comfortable as you continue to write.

yGOmMQP7aa	You have to pay it back because you dropped and weren't eligible to receive the full amount.  Meaning.. the school had to send a part or almost all of your grant money back to the department of education.  You sat in the class and took up space they could have given to someone else.      Meaning what?  Meaning, likely, you now owe your school, AND the Department of Education for your financial aid.  How much exactly you have to pay back can only be determined by the school because it's directly related to the exact date you dropped.  But they are correct, you usually do have to pay back money when you drop classes.      Dropping is never a good idea.  WHY?  Because if you are sharp, you realize you are paying twice for classes you never even got credit for.  In many situations, you owe the school AND you owe the Dept of Education.  Don't DROP!!!  Ever!! It is not worth it and will come back to haunt you.      There are only so many college credit hours you can "Attempt" before the financial aid office will cut you off.  Even classes you dropped count towards this magic number.  Make a habit of dropping classes and your fin aid will be gone (even loans), for good.|`|gmaCvh00aa	You have to pay it back because someone else who would have completed their semester could have used that money.|`|wXPWu0eLaa	Here is an article that might be of interest to you:  http://www.fastweb.com/fastweb/resources...    Dropping Out Means Paying Back Financial Aid  Michael Pugh    As if there weren't enough reasons not to drop out of school, the Department of Education has provided yet another. Students who drop out of college are required to pay back a portion of their federal-aid funds such as the Pell Grant.    Even though many educators and college officials feel that students may be reluctant to accept financial aid and attend college if they fear having to owe money, the government feels that students should have to "earn" their financial aid.     What percentage of his or her aid a student has "earned," and what percentage they may potentially owe, is based on a refund-calculation formula.    And You Thought Trigonometry Was Difficult   The Department of Education's formula for figuring out how much a dropout owes is as follows: students must pay back 50 percent of a percentage (based on when during the semester the student drops out) of aid not used for classes.    A hypothetical case:    "John" receives a $2000 Pell Grant for the semester and uses $1000 for tuition. John drops out one-fourth of the way through the semester. Under the new rule, John has only "earned" 25 percent of his grant. The college is required to return all of John's "unearned" aid that went toward tuition (75 percent, or $750). John is personally required to pay back 50 percent of his unearned aid that didn't go toward tuition. Because he dropped out one-fourth of the way through the semester, John earned $250 of his $1000. Fifty percent of the remaining amount ($750) is $375, which is what John owes.    Complicated? You bet.    If you're concerned about whether you may owe money in the future, the Department of Education has provided universities with software and worksheets to help calculate how much money students may owe.     Why Is This Rule in Effect?   In an introduction to the new regulations, the Department of Education explains:    "Aid is awarded to a student under the assumption that the student will attend an institution for the entire period for which the assistance is awarded. When a student ceases academic attendance prior to the end of that period, the student may no longer be eligible for the full amount of funds that the student was originally scheduled to receive."    Why the Opposition?   Those in opposition to the rule feel that it will primarily affect low-income students, the group most dependent on federal aid. Many financial aid administrators feel that the government shouldn't penalize poor students for dropping out of college, and nor should lower-income students have to "punch a clock" in order to receive their grant money.     Another fear is that if a student has difficulty repaying their aid money, they'll be left with tarnished credit and a near-impossible chance of ever re-entering college.    For better or for worse, the rule will remain in effect for the forseeable future. Now more than ever, the best advice to a discouraged student may be, "stay in school." It might just help them avoid student debt.

Lr0s0gvuaa	You wouldn't have to re-take your community college biology courses again.  (If you did, and the classes showed up on your transcripts twice, admissions people might start to wonder about that.)<br>  <br>  And yes, it is possible to withdraw and start over later.  However, it will also be much more difficult.  All of your grades will show up on your transcripts.  And when people are applying to undergraduate school (especially UC's), admissions doesn't have time to listen to everyone's life story: they judge people by the basics of gpa, test scores, etc.  As a result, your bad scores will be visible to admissions people and that could hurt your chances of being readmitted.<br>  <br>  Why don't you talk to the people at your university about filing to withdraw for a year?  I went to UC Davis, and I know people who withdraw for a term or two (for a medical or made up reason) and came back afterwards.  That way they do not have to go through the whole admissions process again.  It can't hurt to talk to the people about this possibility.|`|2PDBxlYDaa	I've been through this situation, here's what I did.

I took a few years off, re-entered for electrical engineering, and graduated.  I go for my PhD this fall!<br>  <br>  What you need to do is look at UC's policies and procedures - you may not be too late to save it here.  Talk to a counselor there about a leave of absence while you pull it together.  Also investigate their re-admission policies - I was able to get my old grades cancelled as long I was out of school for at least 4 years.<br>  <br>  Then take some time off and pull it together.  Talk to a counselor about the "how long" part - I had incentive to stay out 4 years, you may find something similar.  Do not go back until you are sure that you are ready.  You should be able to go back to UC or similar, rather than a community college, and may even find it easier - they have an incentive to see you graduate once you are enrolled, however long it takes.<br>  <br>  Oh, and your grades will always haunt you - once you get in the door you can probably explain them away, but because of your grades some doors simply will not open.|`|AA10023710	Taking a break from school sounds like a great idea. If you work for a while, and do well at your work, you can transfer to a new university, just as you are. Some unis will take the risk and let you in. <br>  <br>  But to ensure you get into the best university possible, it'd be better to take around a term's worth of classes at a community college, and ace them. You then apply to universities, and point to your work experience, plus your most recent grades, as evidence of your recovery. <br>  <br>  There is no need to do two entire years at the cc. One term's worth of grades would probably be enough. And if you wanted to, after you've worked for a bit and get your life in order, you can start taking those classes part-time, while you work. You don't *have* to go to cc full time, although you can if you'd like to. <br>  <br>  You can't "start community college over again", but you can take classes there. I wouldn't have you enroll for a degree, but take them via continuing ed. Then transfer to a university.|`|2gyJUTzRaa	Taking time off is a great idea.

So I took a semester off to work, and now I'm back in school and doing really well.<br>  <br>  Also, you could talk to an advisor to see if you could retake the classes you failed.  I know at my school, if you retake a class, then the new grade will replace the old one.  You should really tell a counselor everything you asked in this question, because just talking to someone face to face can relieve a lot of stress.

4KtPFzz5aa	After the Chaldean dynasty was established in Babylonia, King Nebuchadnezzar II initiated a new period of building activity at Ur. The last Babylonian king, Nabonidus (reigned 556-539 BC), who appointed his eldest daughter high priestess at Ur, embellished the temples and entirely remodeled the ziggurat of Nanna, making it rival even the temple of Marduk at Babylon. After Babylonia came under the control of Persia, Ur began to decline.

iGxZvP3aaa	Anyone who tries to tell you that teachers, male and female, do not notice the physical attraction of some teenagers is lying.<br>  <br>  There is a long way between noticing physical attraction and being attracted to.  At least for me and I assume for most people.<br>  <br>  In eight years of teaching in a small high school I've known one male teacher who made female students feel creepy by standing too close to them and I know of one male teacher from a neighboring town who had sexual relations with a student.  And there were rampant rumors that a female English teacher often had sex with students after they graduated.  Rumors with no truth behind them as far as I know.<br>  <br>  I've also had two females flirt with me.  One was subtle, clever, and kinda charming about it.  It was always done in public and from a distance in an appeal to get assignments reduced for the entire class, with a sorta wink to it that acknowledged "I'm trying to get you to do what I want.  I'm doing it by flirting, but we both know I don't really mean it."  <br>  The other was blatant and entirely off-putting.  Trying to sit close while getting help on homework and press her leg against mine.  Trying to be close and "accidentally" brush her boobs against my arm.  I spent a lot of time scooting to the other side of the desk.  It felt like she assumed all men are horny old goats and if she pressed her body against mine I'd do whatever she asked.  How very, very wrong she was.|`|SXS2Gf72aa	Why would you wonder that? I mean, obviously so. You hear about the teachers that follow these feelings in the news a lot. Well, not a lot.

Those who beat themselves up over natural and healthy body functions, usually have been badly instructed by phony authority figures.

WwWqONlkaa	Well each section is out of 800, keep that in mind.. So basically, to give you a clear picture of you score, let me calculate your scores as scores out of 100:<br>  <br>  Critical Reading: 65%<br>  Math: 60%<br>  Writing: 57.5%<br>  <br>  overall, 1460 out of 2400, which is 60.83%<br>  <br>  See? you wouldn't like to see those grades on you certificates!!<br>  <br>  MIT students usually get 750+ in math.. and 670+ in reading and writing, and in Harvard they get even higher in reading and writing..<br>  <br>  Anyways.. I bet that you are a very ambitious student and I recommend you go for high scores in the SAT worth getting you into Harvard and MIT.. You're young! You have a chance! Then go for it!!|`|UFU1J41oaa	That's 1460 as a composite score. That's pretty good for a 7th grader. Your critical reading score may qualify for an award. I live in Texas and when I took the SAT in seventh grade for  Duke earning  a 520 in a section qualified you for a state award. Remever the average score is only 1500 and you have a lot of learning to do. I got about the same score as you in 7th grade and just got a 1900 on the sat as a sophmore my frist time. So don't worry you did well, I expect you to get in the 2100  ( good enough for a chance to any college) by the time your a junior of senior.|`|fZITwfi0aa	yeah i took that too this janurary and that is a good score Im in 8th grade though|`|e26c92a93da4f7faf8415b0b3450b5d1aa	very good, i took it a few years back (old sat) and got a 500 math/510 lang.

yGOmMQP7aa	No, you need to put "Will Complete" if your mom has not done your taxes yet.  You can't know what this info will be until she does the form. (The formula for figuring up tax liability changes every year, so even if she had the same income, her tax liability will likely be different.)    If you choose "Already Completed" it will check to see if its the same (which it isn't) and the automated system will likely select your fafsa for verification because of inconsistent data.  This causes delays and makes more work for you.  Do it correctly the first time... better yet, unless your school has a priority deadline making it impossible to do your taxes first... WAIT and submit it after your mom has done her tax forms.      Without them being done you have NO idea what her tax liability is.  Most people don't realize this is NOT the amount of taxes withheld from her paycheck (or listed on her W2) and it is NOT the amount she has to pay when she files her taxes.  Again, you can't get the "Total Tax" amount for the fafsa until she does her taxes.|`|K1xNKSYxaa	No, you should mark everything as close to correct as you can.|`|3fd6fccab2519281a2ab448e7b68b8a3aa	Yeah you can alway change it later on FAFSA|`|nyylb6qUaa	You shouldn't have a problem with it.

AA10738539	I would say that if you are living in the US, Spanish will become increasingly important.

Same goes for journalism school.|`|Jteqao3zaa	at my university you could apply fora special major.  which basically meant that you could appeal to the departmrnt to allow you to form your own degree.  but it wasn't for everybody, you had to present them with a good plan, and a good reason why.  plus you have to meet with the advisor more often so that they can keep tabs on where you are at in your studies,  plus they can turn you down if they want to.  but its not a bafd idea for people who are looking for something very specific that isn't offered by the college.  ask your advisor if your school does anything like this.  and if not, remeber there is always grad school.  if i were you i would major in bio, minor in psych, and go to grad school for journalism, then you can cover storiies about things like cloning, and stem cell research.|`|JRKJ1w3Zaa	hey I want to major in journalism too!<br>  <br>  you could talk to your college about double majoring and a minor if your willing to take that on.<br>  <br>  I think it's great you have so many interest that you want to hang on to.

ktOqm7cgaa	Reading the biography of Daniel Hale Williams, it becomes clear that he was a compassionate, exceptionally intelligent and courageous man who stood for equal rights, hard work, and the values articulated in the hippocratic oath (e.g., to treat the ill to the best of one's ability; to preserve a patient's privacy; to teach the secrets of medicine to the next generation.)  Please see: http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art....   and  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/doctors/oat...    Born an African-American in 1856 in a small town in Pennsylvania, his beginnings were characterized by poverty and a fervent wish to be with his family.  He was 9 years old when his father died of tuberculosis.  His mother was unable to provide for the family and she sent some of her children to live with relatives.  He was apprenticed to a shoemaker in Baltimore, but he ran away to join his mother who had moved to Rockford, Illinois. He later moved to Edgerton, Wisconsin where he joined his sister and opened his own barber shop.    After moving to nearby Janesville, Illinois, he became fascinated with the work of a local physician, Dr. Henry Palmer, and he decided to follow his path. He began working as an apprentice to Dr. Palmer and served in that capacity for 2 years.  Dr. Palmer helped 3 apprentices apply for admission to a top medical school, the Chicago Medical School, which was affiliated with Northwestern University. All 3 were accepted and began their studies in 1880. Dr. Daniel Hale Williams graduated with his medical degree in 1883.    In 1883, he was one of only 4 African-American doctors in the Chicago area, yet he gained so much respect within the medical community that six years later, in 1889, he was appointed to the Illinois Board of Health.      Dr. Williams observed that African-American patients were routinely subject to second-class medical care. Also, opportunities for most African-American physicians were extremely limited, and it was difficult for African-Americans to gain admission to medical and nursing schools because of institutionalized racism.      This prompted him to launch a new venture, the first African-American owned hospital in the United States. It started as a twelve-bed facility, named Provident Hospital. At Provident Hospital, Dr. Williams also opened the first nursing school for African-Americans.  Dr. Williams employed African-American and White doctors at Provident Hospital, emphasizing the need to provide the best available care to everyone. He required that the doctors at Provident keep abreast of the latest advances in medicine.     In 1893, a young man named James Cornish was rushed to Provident Hospital with a stab wound to the chest. Without X-rays, the doctors were unsure what to do for him. His condition deteriorated as signs of internal bleeding appeared. In the operating room, Dr. Williams made the decision to open the man's chest. He saw the damage to the man's pericardium and sutured it, then applied antiseptic procedures before closing his chest.  James Cornish survived the operation; recovered; and lived another twenty years. Dr. Williams had become the first surgeon to open the chest cavity and the sac surrounding the heart successfully without the patient dying of infection. His procedures became standards for future internal surgeries.    In 1894, Dr. Williams was appointed as Chief Surgeon at the Freedmen's Hospital in Washington, D.C. where he reorganized the hospital, creating seven medical and surgical departments, setting up pathological and bacteriological units, establishing a biracial staff of highly qualified doctors and nurses and established an internship program.  Almost immediately there was a significan increase in efficiency as well as a decrease in patient deaths.    After his marriage, he and his wife moved to Chicago where he resumed his position as Chief Surgeon at Provident Hospital (which could now accommodate 65 patients). He was often invited to speak to doctor's associations around the country on the subject of health care for African-Americans.  But he still had work to do. He was anxious to train more African-American doctors. He visited Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. As in Chicago, African American doctors were not allowed into the city's hospitals. He urged that Meharry start its own hospital. He helped raise money. He made wise suggestions. Soon Meharry had its own hospital. He continued to encouraged African-American leaders to open hospitals in other cities where African-American people would receive first rate care.      The American Medical Association refused to accept African-American members.  Undaunted, Dr. Williams helped to set up and served as Vice-President of the National Medical Association.  He received numerous honors and was the first African-American physician to be named as a Fellow in the American College of Surgeons.     He retired in 1926 after suffering a stroke.  He passed away in 1931 after living a life that stood for healing, teaching, accomplishment and social justice.|`|eceLQUj5aa	Well he was a surgeon back in the late 1800's early 1900's. He is credited as performing the first successful surgery on a human heart. I am not sure if that is exactly what you are looking for, but that is what he is known for.

9r1zw0evaa	what you do is this, take the numbers under the radical (squ. root) and find 2 numbers that you can multiply to get that number.  For example, lets use 40.  So I can expand 40 under the radical by making it 10 x 4.  Now here is the trick.  Find the squ. root of 4.  Since it's 2, you take that square root and place it next to the radical like this...<br>  <br>  2√10<br>  <br>  So yeah, if you expand the number, you can simplify it,  and that's the simplest form unless you find the squ. root of 10 and multiply it by 2.  Once you understand my example, it's really easy.  Sorry I didn't just answer the question, but I actually want you to learn from this and be able to do this on your own because on your test we can't help you.  So in the long run, I am actually helping you by not doing these problems/HW.|`|YMI6Yl18aa	When you have to simplify an exoression like this, what you have to do is to take the bigger number and find two factors, of which one of them can be square rooted. <br>  <br>  1) √242 = sqrt 121 x 2<br>  <br>  121 can be square rooted so we take that out of the brackets = 11√2<br>  <br>  The rest follow along a similar theme.|`|wWaGn3WLaa	on the fisrt one you divide 242 by 2 and get 121. take the square root of 121 and it is 11, that is how the 11 is on the outside. you leave the 2 inside the square root.<br>  <br>  on the second one the answer is 3 times the square root of 17. you divide 153 by 9 getting the square root of 9 times 17. the square root of 9 is 3 so you pull it out. then you get 3 times the square root of 17.|`|ZM8GKnBZaa	first when you just have the square root of 242 you factor it like a tree<br>              242<br>            2   121<br>               11  11<br>  the pairs only go down once and the not pair number(s) you put before the square root and the pair goes down once in the inside<br>  so you get 2 square root 11

AA10464818	Scammers are getting desperate<br>  <br>  You may want to read the warnings FTC has issued against these "grant" companies:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/03/grantresources.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/03/grantreso...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt134.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer...</a><br>  <br>  Here is also one of the warnings issued by the Better Business Bureau <a href="http://www.concord.bbb.org/tips_timesharescams.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.concord.bbb.org/tips_timeshar...</a><br>  <br>  If you want grants - go only to GOVERNMENT websites.<br>  <br>  You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) <a href="http://www.cfda.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfda.gov</a> and Grants.gov <a href="http://www.grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.grants.gov</a> - these are two FREE sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.|`|df9f7cedfb85f18f6689c6f840f93cbfaa	Star love is correct. Also keep in mind you will probably get spammed a ton for going to yhe site and fill out the info. If they ask for a credit card Number go buy a disposable for 10 dollars. That way if it is a scam you only lose ten bucks.|`|BS0Poa8naa	TOTAL SCAM....<br>  <br>  This ad runs with several different variations, but almost the same exact page layout, and exactly the same Terms and Conditions, just with different amounts that are charged to your card.<br>  <br>  You sign up for the $1.99 CD/DVD, and have 7 days to return it for a full refund. Problem is the CD is dated from your time of purchase and after 7 days, and no CD, your credit card is billed anywhere between $ 69.95 (in some of the other ads) to in the case of this "john" ad $94.89 with an additional $ 94.89 each month. Read the terms and conditions, you'll see what I'm talking about.  The stories I read indicated customer service is impossible to get hold of so it's very difficult to cancel the order by phone.  Other fraudulent charges were said to start showing up on the credit cards as well. <br>  <br>  There's an online site I found, before I filled out the application, with horror stories of people who got scammed by these guys, and ended up having to cancel their credit cards to stop charges.<br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor and research the Federal Government site.  Stay away from this.|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	"* The free trials worked well for me and for many other people, but results may vary by person. Also, keep in mind that I got the grant trials for free, but there is a shipping fee and some advertisers have terms regarding continued billing after trial expires if you do not cancel. Some advertisers require trial to be canceled within seven or fourteen days of the trial period while some other advertisers give you thirty days to cancel the free trial. Please see terms per advertiser regarding the specific amount of days required to cancel your free trial before continued billing begins. The grant kits I recommend usually retail for around seventy dollars. If you enjoy the products, simply do nothing. You will be billed at a discounted price, usually around fifty or sixty dollars at the end of the free trial period. By signing up YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CONSUMER TRANSACTION INVOLVES A NEGATIVE OPTION AND THAT YOU MAY BE LIABLE FOR PAYMENT OF FUTURE GOODS AND SERVICES, UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, IF YOU FAIL TO NOTIFY THE SUPPLIER NOT TO SUPPLY THE GOODS OR SERVICES DESCR"<br>  <br>  Read the small print. It's a scam if you have pay first.|`|o5uEqIR5aa	I am not sure, but this "John" has not posted any contact details and the page is not a blog as he claims it to be, but a sales page. The domain name was also registered anonymously by proxy so there is no way of finding out if this chap is for real?<br>  <br>  Funny enough, I was just about to leave this page when I saw a sponsored ad for Bob's cash story. www.bobscashstory.com and guess what the sales page is the same but this time our John Cambell is named Bob Dahlberg and his check is for $5600 not $12,000 as the ad page states.<br>  If you look closely at the check in the picture it looks like the name printed on the check might be Kevin Hoffer  and at the bottom of the check it has printed "economic stimulus payment"?<br>  <br>  This all looks very fishy.|`|MM8FbFk1aa	of course is a scam. These grants don't exist. Besides, logically, see how is the economy now. We may hardly get a credit  of 400 or 800 dollars, and only those who pay taxes. <br>  <br>  General rule: if something looks too good to be true, it definitely is.
