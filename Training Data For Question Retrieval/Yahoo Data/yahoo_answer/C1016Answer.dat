dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	I think it will happen if you remember the last draft, when Batista came back to RAW. He and Triple H were seen being quite happy to see each other. Plus with Batista being out of action because of Orton why not have him comeback and team up with Triple H. If WWE wouldn't released Manu we could've seen the second coming of Evolution.<br>  <br>  Evolution 2.0<br>  Triple H<br>  Batista<br>  Manu<br>  Sim Snuka<br>  <br>  The Legacy<br>  Orton<br>  Dibiase Jr<br>  Rhodes|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	After HHH has finished his feud, Batista will enter a feud with Orton for revenge|`|rs7fuvPxaa	RANDY ORTON RULES!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ATyoVtehaa	BOTCHTISTA SUCKS|`|JDuEuPM4aa	No, Having Batista as a part of this feud will ruin it.<br>  <br>  Batista would have no means at all in this rivalry and it would be a fairly pointless thing to do.<br>  <br>  Batista had surgey on his leg so the whole punt to the head thing isn't strong enough to make him a part of the feud and a lot of people have probobly forgotten all about the punt to the head of Batista anyway which would confuse people even more|`|3ExtDP45aa	Batista isn't back til August.<br>  <br>  I think that the Triple H and Orton storyline will last until after Wrestlemania and then as soon as Batista comes back it will be Batista vs Orton<br>  <br>  As wrestlers tend to go after the person that put them on the shelf|`|fj2d3wfKaa	I think it would happen cause Triple and Batista r really good friends and batista wont stand for what randy did 2 his family|`|nAISM360aa	Nope, Batista has just had surgery I think on his shoulder or arm and wont be back for another couple of months!|`|W9f1QFcgaa	i hope so, can't wait until he comes back on our screens again.|`|JhdhXrdraa	yeah possible but i would rather see thriple h and shawn michaels do it<br>  <br>  DX Suck IT!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|GExKoh1Gaa	for it to work .Triple h MUST turn heel.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	no|`|VQlrQ34Faa	I think we could see a new trio of Triple H, HBK and Batista since all three hate Randy Orton.

br1kwegaaa	Kenny Smith participated in both events in 1993.  He was the only one to have done both events in the same year.  <br>  <br>  Note: MJ and Brent Barry have participated in the slam dunk contest and the 3 point contest, but in different years.|`|AA10915692	I think one year Jordan tried the 3 pt shootout. Of course Stern let him. Whatever Michael wanted. Michael got. Of course he stunk too.<br>  <br>  Edit.<br>  The year Jordan participated in the 3 point shoot out, he did not participate in the dunk contest.|`|FbHxkey6aa	Jordan did.... maybe Kobe also?? :S|`|wXxJUnLJaa	I don't think so.|`|21J0IIZbaa	Kenny Smith is the only player to do both in the same year.
kQSSz2X2aa	If you can legally carry a concealed weapon in your state you can carry anything as long as you can conceal it. To obtain a full auto you need to apply for and purchase a $200 stamp and obtain an automatic weapon. This gun has to be stamped 1986 or before for you to legally own it because of the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986. Because there is a limited amount of these guns available they are VERY expensive.<br>  <br>  Concealing a full auto would be highly impractical. Also, using full auto bursts greatly reduces your accuracy. <br>  But, if you really wanted to, you live in a state that allows you to do so, you have a ccw permit (unless you are in Alaska or Vermont where no permit is needed), you get your stamp so you can purchase full auto guns, you shell out the $$$ for one, and are able to conceal it, then yes, you can conceal a full auto legally.|`|AA11694178	In order to purchase or own any fully automatic weapon, you must have a license issued by BATF.  This license is referred to as a "Transfer Fee" but is actually a license.  This license costs $200 the last I heard.  If you go to www.batf.gov you will find the necessary forms that you will have to submit.  Next, you will need to have a Concealed Carry permit issued by your state.  This permit may have restrictions that would limit what kinds of guns are permitted for concealed carry in your state.  If you are permitted to carry a fully auto weapon and have all of the necessary licenses, you are good to go.<br>  <br>  I must add, though, that I seriously doubt that you will ever get a permit to carry a fully auto weapon concealed........but I have been wrong before.|`|SPleGlS1aa	This would depend on the state laws. For example, Arizona law is that if you have a Concealed Weapon Permit, you may carry any weapon that you legally own.  Other states specify that you may only carry a handgun.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	It would of course depend on where you live, laws vary state to state. As far as the MP5 goes I doubt the year of manufacture has any bearing. Some states may have "Grandfather" clauses that would exempt you if you already possessed the weapon prior to any changes in the laws.|`|DV4xyeChaa	im always amazed by lack of knowledge in answers.. the girl has 1st right answer [mostly].. other guy correct too... 200 gets a transfer [ie auto weapon lic.]  and the feds on you.. every state is different...my state VA very easy to get carry.. 3 days of class and 50 dollar fee. ive heard people say 50 cal BMG caliber  guns are illegal [wrong] and people who use terms automatic pistol and semi automatic not knowing difference [mostly news people]..   go to your state laws on the web and read..my state has thousands of laws on crap you can't believe... the cops don't know them all and neither do the lawyers and judges...yet we should...go figger|`|kHBCUxwHaa	yes|`|h2f6j0yiaa	you can not buy an MP5 in 47 or so states unless you have a special license, and by the sound of you question you dont have and can no tget that license.

5ddcee7d6456ce861067c56dd7be6025aa	Hey hi...firstly i can say....Nothing can be gained in a over night but u can still follow some tips to make it better and best. First thing in 100m is the start up. Practice your start up several time. There will be regular format for the start up. Try to google it and get it. Other important thing is your hand moment. and dont eat heavily before the race. Warm up and streching exercises are mandatory..... Do u have spikes with you?? spikes are different from normal shoes. Spike shoes increase your speed like anything. Spike shoes should always be as tight as possible.....dont get strained before the race and sleep well......Good luck.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	make sure u have alot of complex carbs today.. like brown rice.. oatmeal. u need to load up on your glycogen leveals. as well as proteins<br>  <br>  also bring with u a powerrade drink to drink bewteen running tommorow|`|rkIdwsc1aa	It's a bit last minute isn't it. Nothing you do today is going to affect you tomorrow. You can gain stamina in less than 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Just eat well today, get a good nights sleep, don't do any exercises today, you'll just fatigue yourself for tomorrow.<br>  <br>  The warm up sounds good. I would do that.<br>  <br>  Just try your best and next time plan this at least a couple of months in advance.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|4bDPhnCKaa	the best thing you can do is not eat so much rest the next day like u said warm up as u run concentrate on breathing and focus on what ur doing breath trough ur nose and take it out trough ur mouth that's how i do it and my stamina works find
aTBs7pJ4aa	i like to hav a big meal an hour and a half before...... that way i do not feel too bloated before i play..<br>  <br>  and then u can have little snacks bewteen... like fruit sticks or powerade.. or protein bars...|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	your supposed eat a medium-small sized meal like 2-4 hours before you play. But more importantly your supposed to 2 cups of water 2 hours before you play. <br>  <br>  I try to have an energy drink, because the caffeine is proven to help hand eye coordination and reaction time.|`|uwx7etCXaa	You can't have a heavy meal and expect to play a good match.  I suggest you have a garden or a fruit salad about half an hour before your match.  This way, you'll have the energy to run and play hard.  Drink lots of water too, to keep your body hydrated, if you can your hands on a couple of Gatorades, it will be awesome.  I heard that Gatorade is good during a match, to replenish your carbs.|`|NR5LhOpPaa	I don't usually eat right before a match.  Maybe and hour or two before the match.  Do not load up on starches, such as pasta, right before a match.  Eating a lot of carbs the day before a match is beneficial, but not right before a match.  It'll sit in your stomach like a rock.  <br>  <br>  When I played in high-school, we would occasionally have matches at 5:00.  On those days, I would bring a small sandwich with me, and eat it around 4 or 4:30.  After the match is over, it's good to have some small snacks.  Pretzels, fruit, bagels, and cereal bars are good options.  Actually, you could eat a banana right before a match, and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Also, don't do energy drinks.  The sugar and the caffeine are too temporary, and they actually dehydrate your body.  Drink water or something like gatorade before and during the match. Never energy drinks.|`|utKtg5Tsaa	about an hour or you will get sick..... i usually have fruits and vegetables and maybe bread, nothing that is really heavy or you wont feel well!|`|A2SogiGCaa	2 or 1 hour|`|ObRSaIxMaa	I normally eat about a half hour to an hour before a tennis match so I have energy. You should eat before a tennis match because your energy will be lacking if you dont have food in your stomach.|`|2qMurjgPaa	I agree with everyone<br>  eating a banana helps a lot too right before you hit<br>  small carbo snacks help for energy and help after a match|`|6ZQfNjicaa	it is better to eat at least an hour before the match, also try not to eat a lot, just enough to feel full|`|0zwnZKwiaa	I suggest people to eat light meals such as bread and have a cup of coffee to make you alert when you are playing. avoid eating heavily!|`|5OmY6S1Waa	Maybe 2 hours before, then a streching

KbzXg3hfaa	Sachin is a class player who is above 20/20 (which along with the IPL is killing traditional cricket).<br>  <br>  Also the Indian team and fans have to quit being so bloody reliant on him. He is not a god and he wont live forever. Warne and Gilly were the Aussie equivalents in their roles, and now Aus have to do without them and move on.|`|AA11088802	for me . yes|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	sachin has said he wont T20 int, now|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	Yea, sachin can be a good addition. He can come in place of Sharma but the master blaster himself opted out of T20 match!!!

0Dm3WEMcaa	I don't like how the whole thing has been handled, it started off as a young guns showing not respect angle into just another Face/Heel Faction story which I didn't like. Taking out every major Frontline member wasn't a good move either just left them with a hole which had team 3D in a main event for a world title! during a number of beat downs members of the frontline like ODB, Creed and Lethal we knew where backstage... didn't come rushing to make the save and even if they did Kurt Angle apparently has Shane McMahon style superpowers and can easily beat LAX on his own and handle 3 men at once... Yeah okay... sorry little off topic but it links in.<br>  <br>  Now we have Sting and Angle falling out over... I'm not actually sure what. They have gone from brothers in arms to hating each other and wanting to end careers in 3 weeks now if they had lost the world title to the frontline in the fatal four way (if they had AJ or Joe around not to team 3D) they would have something to fight about because they were both in the match but no they are just trying to kill each other because angle wants the title... a one on one match in a friendly manner building tension that angle can't beat sting makes more sense. The whole booking of this has been poor IMO.<br>  <br>  Having said all that I actually do see some kind of plan to what they are doing, while Angle and Sting fall out getting caught up in their own drama the returning frontline members are taking out the rest of the mafia so that will leave just Angle alone to fight off the revenge hungry Frontline. In that way the story works but it could have been done so much better.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Is there even a frontline anymore? They just exist in name.<br>  <br>  But I knew a MEM vs. MEM storyline was going to come out of this from the beginning. TNA once again f*cks over their young talent for the over-the-hill "veterans"|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	i think they need to have aj and joe in matches instead of just beating people up for near a month<br>  <br>  also they need to end it because they aren't coming up with any new material as far as mem vs frontline goes|`|gfxXikenaa	TNA used to be good but from recently they started to mess up and lost alot fans (me included)|`|NRs72Afxaa	It started off to be a good storyline. They had the Veterans against the young lions.  I thought adding two Ecw originals made sense because Rhyno and 3D fought tooth and nail to keep Ecw in business just like the Tna originals did to keep Tna in business.<br>  <br>  I'm starting to get mad now, because recently The Mafia has been making the young lions look weak by having someone like Mick Foley beat all the members  instead of Aj Styles or Samoa Joe. Don't get me wrong I'm a Mick Foley fan, but the man is overweight he needs to focus on staying in shape.<br>  <br>  I'm still asking myself why the hell did that released Petey Williams. He had the best finishing move and had loads of potential and with all potential Tna fired him instead of a Booker T(who thinks backstage he is the main guy) or a bad creative writer. That is Bull ****!<br>  <br>  Their is one more chance left in this storyline to get good again. Destination X seems like the perfect place. If Samoa Joe or Aj Styles doesn't go over in the matches especially the way how good they've been getting treating I may have to turn off the tv every thursday until someone e-mails me "it is getting good again."<br>  <br>  I also emailed Tna a letter "About their creative booking". Note: The letter ain't insulting and is fair to read. Lets hope they read it.|`|tPFikOY7aa	I feel bothered a bit because it appears that suddenly samoa joe is making another group instead of coming back to the frontline. So i am confused.|`|rs7fuvPxaa	I really enjoy the current storyline. So i don't care about this stuff|`|F3VjJAdiaa	I agree with La Parka. I also hope TNA can outlast the MEM. Something WCW couldn't really do with nWo.

As your team won...<br>  Edit-Im in shock . Pls understand my condition. This picture is hurting me.|`|8CtqfHgoaa	yep, perfect way to cap off our first victory. We deserve it|`|fsLMFIpgaa	That's a great picture, how did he capture that? Yes it looks exactly like a champagne cork popping|`|M8XmhqIhaa	lol, of course it does! Anyways, congrats to the Kiwi players, they completely outplayed India. But watch out, India will fight back!|`|wz8gx3gaaa	You have got a good imagination.|`|OJtFNjfvaa	Lol yea and I bet its the kiwis|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	let the bubbly fly|`|AA11088802	MAn ! what a pic.. nice one
wXxJUnLJaa	He will have more.|`|A71U6gNtaa	he can be 1 or 2 in the list|`|0ytjj1EGaa	If He Stays Like This He Will Reach 25000 after 6 years or at least be Close to it|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Probably and hope so|`|f931be7e45f5d51817c8a31a462b08d4aa	In 6 more years, if he keeps scoring the way he is right now, he could very well crack 25K.  Keep in mind Kobe just passed Elgin Baylor on the all-time scoring list (23,469 I think) and that took Kobe 12 years to do.<br>  <br>  I think it would be hard for Lebron to break the 30K mark though..........he would either have average 50 points a game (like wilt), or stay playing for 20+ years (like Abdul-Jabbar).  Either way, that is a hard road.|`|TbEwkoQDaa	I think Lebron's offense will be bothered by injuries and Lebron will not be the same as he was today.  Lebron can either become a shooter or a center for Cavs..|`|StUgkRp6aa	he is not going to be as good as he is right now so there is a small possibility|`|FbHxkey6aa	wouldn't put it past him, a natural talent of the modern game|`|h9ZRYMWzaa	I think he'll be about third on that list but he'll be first before he retires|`|8aVq045Gaa	He will be in Greece the NBA is dying|`|khbLZQHIaa	Yes.<br>  It's going to be a crazy high number too. (Maybe 27,000 when he's 30)  Especially since he's going to be in his prime.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	It really depends who he gets on his team if the Cavs do nothing to help LeBron will keep adding 30 or 40 pts a night to that total.

Otherwise he is a very average wrestler and quite boring to watch.

HPqqgtOSaa	it should be known as Entertainment Championship Wrestling cause it's extremely crappy with no hardcore and blood so what's the point of keeping the name EXTREME?|`|F3VjJAdiaa	Yes, the should close down ECW, rename SD into WCW and just have WCW and RAW. Two quality shows over 3 (and soon to be 4) quantity shows.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	no need to change the letters but this change is good...<br>  <br>  ecw is currently extreme championship wrestling but should change it to<br>  <br>  extreme crappy wresting|`|037d26fcff528b19e4939c529e6ccad8aa	i'm thinkling to get with the time<br>  <br>  because of the pg rating they could change back to the orrignally name eastern championship wreslteing<br>  <br>  or the could rename it all togther and call it titan of wreslteing like what they had before raw<br>  <br>  or they can call it heat<br>  <br>  really thats what it is|`|e2wBOdHMaa	yes because the original ecw stood for much more than this wwe ripoff they ruined the brand once they bought it|`|rs7fuvPxaa	they should change it to heat or an entirely new brand name|`|NyX1ydlJaa	oh yes my brother i though no one was thinking thesame way i was thinking in my own opinion they should change it to something like<br>  FIRE HALL.
vJyF8siJaa	Kobe's more popular than Fish that's why he's being overshadowed. Fish helped us alot since he return to the Lakers. He's a big reason of our success.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I suppose its a blind love for some. I've been a Laker fan since hector was a pup and not many people will get that reference but that's ok. D Fish has hit some huge shots over the years for the lakers  and I suppose that's where it comes from. I admire the guys work ethic and he did get better as he got older. But yes, he gets burned all the time at the point and it is time for him to play a reserve role off the bench like B Shaw did earlier this decade. When any player plays for one teams for any Lent of time its easy for fans to to develop a love fest. I don't know why the Lakers ever let him go in the first place.|`|7859db4349d703a0c747d4e81276b851aa	because he is overshadowed by kobe.<br>  <br>  he is a great player and im glad the lakers signed him back last year =P|`|0ytjj1EGaa	1-Because He is A laker<br>  <br>  2-Great Ethic<br>  <br>  3-He is Doing A Good Job with lakers<br>  <br>  <br>  I Know he is not the best PG but he is doing his job perfectly|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Not a Laker fan, but I've noticed that too.|`|5ANmjtLOaa	overshadowed.|`|f931be7e45f5d51817c8a31a462b08d4aa	It think has to do with Derek Fisher's background story.  You might be able to find an interview on him in youtube.  <br>  <br>  He may not be the best PG in the league, but he is a stand-up guy, and many players in the league could learn a thing or two from him about humility.|`|tefmLFmWaa	He's a class act, a 4tenths of a second hero, and I guess it has to do with his personal life too like the struggle of her daughter, and stuff...|`|ISQAWUf2aa	i like every laker player.|`|StUgkRp6aa	fisher sets most shot up for kobe.<br>  Odem is a beast though
AA10241450	Blisters are usually called by friction and your sweat.  To prevent you can use antiperspirant stick on your feet.  After your runs if your socks are sweaty put on a dry pair.  Better yet buy some good running socks and shoes that fit your feet.  For the socks look for good material such as cool max or look at the reviews of the best socks in runner's world website.<br>  <br>  Your running shoes should also have adequate ventilation and make sure sure shoes are snug not too tight or loose.  You may want to shoelace your shoes tighter. Good luck and treat your blisters before they get worse.|`|6f45797c9517e54511512714a28d3760aa	I've had similar problems. I've started applying a vaseline foot cream to the blister area (outside edge of my big toes) which seems to be helping. Also generally looking after my feet helps: I give them a good soak in the bath, use a pumice stone with soap to gently remove dead skin, then give a good application of the foot cream which I rub in well. Also apply before bed and before a run. I'm doing my first marathon this weekend, so hoping they'll hold up OK!|`|dWqkgpLHaa	I used to get terrible blisters on my feet from running. You can also test different pairs of socks, what works best for me are the more thin pairs of running socks. Glide works great too, it looks like deodorant, but all you have to do is rub it where you get blisters before you run.
UIcItboeaa	If you're doing ti slow, thats a front limber, in which case, youre doing it right. Faster, its a handspring, and its ok to squat a bit when you land. If you do it automatically to standing, that's an Arabian, not to be confused with an Arabian, the flight element in tumbling (1/2 in front out). As you get more used to it, you'll find that you get out of the crowching position more quickly and gracefully, but thats how it goes.<br>  In a walkover, you can't land like that, as your feet go over in sequence, not together. You should stand it up  with the first leg that went down still pointed and up.|`|TZi4ChYYaa	Ok you probably know this but there is a difference between front walkover and a front handspring. <br>  <br>  1.Front walkover, start like handstand and kick your legs over one after the other to stand up on one leg!<br>  Here's a youtube link<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRS1KbPiSjo&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRS1KbPiS...</a><br>  <br>  2. Front Handspring - land legs together and they leave the ground together as well.<br>  <br>  As for your problem I think that maybe you aren't doing it right. Sorry its hard to see you doing one! For your slow problem perhaps your leags aren't seperated. <br>  <br>  If you have a video of you doing one I'll be really happy to help if you want to email it to me<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|9Ute4yidaa	You NEED TO BLOCK!!!!! (push off with your sholders) if you do that then you can get up really fast and high (you wont crouch) also lots of speed helps. You can go to a gym and have a coach help you with it( do a private or open gym) Pratice pratice pratice!!! :)<br>  Good luck!!!!!!!!!!!! :D<br>  Best answer plz???|`|mWuR0V93aa	there are 2 sorts of walovers, the type where you do a split in the air and the type where you go in a handstand and land in a bridge.
AQrjyQZzaa	yousuf pathan,virender sehwag,zaheer khan.|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	Their strength lies in their UNITY! And the captain and the coach are keeping the whole team united!! If i'm to take anyone's name then i think Gary Kirsten & Dhoni both are the pillars of this STRONG Indian Team. <br>  <br>  And if u are talking abt performance....like Whose the best performer in the Indian team?? Then, it's Sehwag! he makes things look so simple. When Sehwag's on crease, the whole Indian team is like "Sehwag's there so why fear"! His explosive batting makes huge score look small!!! In short, he is a dynamite and always gives a full-power packed performance!!!|`|uKLlkOPSaa	It must be a good team work - individually one can do nothing - unity is strength - team spirit can bring WCs and what not.|`|94ab0da7299b6d087039f5b8d0109652aa	Only Team Work.

He enjoys other successes. Probably, you have observed how he stands up and claps on others successes. He is the most powerful player in Indian side at the moment.|`|T2n4i0Rtaa	i think it is MS Dhoni, because he is the backbone of the team. his controlled agression always boosts the team spirit. his average of 47 and his number 1 status as a batsmen in world cricket also tells us that he is one of the best players in the team.|`|W3OCQGiraa	Team work and composition is the strength of the Indian team. The team is in good form. This game of cricket is not just about 1 single player. It's those 11 players on the field that matter.|`|QayNFEd6aa	well, according to me, there are two pairs of cricketers.<br>  1)dhoni and yuvraj<br>  2)pathan brothers.(mainly t20)|`|516af81cc209ef7323098de133b16030aa	the whole team is considered as a power.no individual can solely win a match for us.|`|eJtAASdlaa	EXPLOSIVE SEHWAG (CURRENT FORM)|`|2awj8ptIaa	M.S.Dhoni (Mr.Cool)|`|oRIWyTZxaa	I believe it is the team work|`|AA11088802	Dhoni|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	dhoni|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	India should not depend on any particular player for success.<br>  I would rather expect the whole team to become a power.|`|TuGkVqwraa	Everyone in Indian Team.|`|OJtFNjfvaa	Ishant sharma|`|2s244jGgaa	MS DHONI, LEGEND & ALWAYS WIL BE.
cOm8LQ1Daa	Yea...Rohit probably needs some time out! Jadeja was in a good form in the previously concluded SL series. I think the young man should get a chance to portray this abilities!!|`|QtdO1RlQaa	Dude..... Rohit Sharma is OUT OF FORM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  If Sachin is out of form, if Raina is out of form, if Yuvi is out of form, the whole world is present to sympathise with them, but Rohit Sharma, NOBODY??????????????????????????????????...<br>  Enough is enough to all those who've called the selectors to drop Rohit...... <br>  FORM IS TEMPORARY, CLASS IS PERMANENT!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  One more thing..... Rohit Sharma is a stroke maker who are very few nowadays.... And Rohit Sharma will be the one who will hold the innings together without hitting out.... He hasnt been able to so far but im sure that he WILL in the future...<br>  Being in and out of the team doesnt help bro!|`|oRIWyTZxaa	Right he is a good choice, also Rohit is showing is his class.  Depending on pitch and playing condition choice have to be made|`|WCFgTRVWaa	totally agree with u, drop irfan pathan and rohit sharma, and bring in jedeja and pravin kumar|`|516af81cc209ef7323098de133b16030aa	i can't say about ravindra jadeja but rohit should be dropped.|`|eJtAASdlaa	YES.. HE IS A GOOD OPTION ..HE IS A GOOD HITTER THAN ROHIT AND A HANDY SPINNER...|`|uKLlkOPSaa	Please leave it to selectors - coaches and captain|`|3GHIyXWTaa	He is a good player but waste too much balls.so he Isn'tt better than ROHIT sharma|`|AA11088802	yes|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|RGxMkT0zaa	Rohit Sharma is a good batsman, not in form.<br>  Give him a chance.

They will rally round.|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	He should have known his role.ie to stay with S.Raina by rotating the strike.Instead he too was tempted to go over the ropes.<br>  R.Jadeja should be in.|`|ZT9I6uJLaa	Yea..............tht was needed...........Sharma is the most overrated and the most biased player i hav ever seen..........hope the selectors think a bit more while pickin the squad.............|`|OJtFNjfvaa	No, I think there team is strong.

ab5ee73c4a40583a54daa8bd7423eeefaa	I teach martial arts and have been for about 3 years, trust me it's NEVER too late to learn how to do martial arts. Just the other day we had somebody come by to try us out who is 36. 15 is a great age.
T2UZXarLaa	nope nothing<br>  <br>  almost all boards now come with an intial factory wax so thats unnessary the firs time and your edges are as sharp as they will ever be. get out there and ride!<br>  <br>  if you dont feel satisfied go ahead wax it it cant hurt it|`|CqB5ryTFaa	it isnt waxed but it should ride well if it is brand new because the bottom has a wax like coating that makes it easy to ride.  And yea it is sharpened so your edges will be awesome in the snow and hold really well if it is new.
kecdkv6jaa	I take catches like that for breakfast!! lol<br>  <br>  As long as players athleticism keeps improving we willl continue to see spectacular catches like those 2 and more.<br>  There are good catches seen in T20 like that because the are more catching opportunities which adds to the entertainment factor of the game.<br>  <br>  But some of the best catches i have ever seen in fact most of them are from test matches.|`|uKLlkOPSaa	Yes - t20 is a super fast match - definetely we are going to see much and more catches|`|GdJTQX6raa	fantastic feast for eyes and full credit to Jacob Oram and Voges|`|nwZD5mzRaa	That was a fantastic catch! We will definitely see more of those.|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	Yea, Voges showed everyone a new way to take a catch at the boundary line!!! The fielder gotto 've a good reflex action in order to take the catch. It's like catch it when inside the boundary line...toss it up in the air if u r in a uncomfortable position....comeback again into the boundary line and take the catch easily!!! I think every fielder would like to give it a try....it would prevent a six and the fielder would definitely feel good after taking such a catch!<br>  <br>  Voges's catch was a natural one & Oram's catch was a well thought one! That's the only difference.|`|T9YYrIupaa	Yep. I am surely hoping to see such catches in the future. That was a great cathc. His height helped him a lot. Not only thins type of cathces will be seen but many more types of catches would be seen. Not only in T20's but in ODI's and Tests also I hope to see such catches..........=)|`|sMoKtO5Paa	Yes, why not.<br>  <br>  <br>  T20 is a fast and furious contest. India hit so many sixes today but still has at loosing side.<br>  <br>  This is a charm of T20|`|4bEejG3jaa	Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.............|`|mber3JoAaa	And those two catches were only 10 days apart too. Yes we will see more of them, I am certain!|`|eJtAASdlaa	YES IN FUTURE WE WILL SEE MORE SUCH  CATCHES LIKE THAT...SURE ...|`|GoepUF9gaa	YES<br>  TODAY IT IS EXCELLENT CATCH|`|oRIWyTZxaa	yes, it will be a treat to watch|`|YjMiWinuaa	It was luck by chance....but sure its a treat to watch catches like this......|`|AA11088802	not even in t20 in test and ODI too.. cause fielding standards goes better and better|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yup

r5AMG8g7aa	No it would be hard to hit what you are throwing at normally. When you are surprised and nervous you will be even worse with your aim. Besides they are illegal most places.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	No. No shuriken would be good for home defense (especially the one in the link). The Ninja used them to distract their enemies, not kill them. The shuriken were never made to kill. They also wouldn't be good for self defense UNLESS you have training in Ninjutsu. It's not as simple that throwing them that what you want to hit. There's a technique to it.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	No I don't think so.  A shuriken requires accuracy and skill and it won't stop most people unless it is a really vulnerable spot that it hits.  A good Louisville slugger would probably require less skill to wield and use effectively.  Swinging it to generate force when you have the room to hit someone and jabbing with the end of it when you are in close quarters would probably be more effective than a shuriken if you don't care to have a firearm in the house.  I might also add that an ounce of prevention is worth a gallon of cure in this case and there are a lot of things you can do to make your home less of a target for thieves and thugs.  Contact your local police department; most have programs whereby they come out and give a quick evaluation of your home and yard and can make several recommendations concerning this.|`|AjdubqYPaa	With the previous answer was almost going to write something then followed the link. Funny but border line.<br>  So will say have a good one.
AA12370193	Keep him inside and he may hit the roof.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	No, but we got the goal and the clean sheet, so it's alright.   We really should have scored 3 or 4 though.<br>  <br>  His biggest problem is his first touch is so bad, he always wastes great balls into the box, even if he has all the space in the world.    Seems he can only score with his head.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	most definately he can hit a barn sideways and from the outside,it's the f**king net he can't hit into.|`|IWM1khX7aa	Nope.  He couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat.|`|ceef93d1024d0e6a2e214650ffb17d50aa	Bendtner couldn't catch a cold in Moscow.

pLoCn8dWaa	I'm sure they're pleased, although i'm not sure exactly how much of the information was actually USED.<br>  I'm glad that it's over, and that this year, Lewis Hamilton got the championship MORE than fairly, due to the arguable decisions by the race stewards...<br>  <br>  But yes, I think that the spy scandal caused too much politics in F1, and I'm hoping that 2009 will just be about great racing.|`|KTxxd700aa	Yes, an ugly part of F1 history is hopefully consigned to history.|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	SPYING OVER!!! Never gonna happen|`|yz6G7jfXaa	you got it all wrong my friend.<br>  i've herd this from many F1 insiders: 'there wasn't a single bolt on the Mclaren that had anything to do with the ferrari'<br>  it's a long story, not sure if you'll understand.<br>  in the end Mclaren had to publish an apology, SIMPLY to put an end to the matter, that would let them concentrate on the '09 championship, and let the matter go.<br>  that apology is what makes people believe that Mclaren were the guilty party. the letter was written by Lawyers, not engineers clearly.<br>  <br>  the fact is, data transfer like this happens althrought the grid, it' isn't a secret.<br>  but Nigel stephany's role there is ridiculous!
tX4RNX1faa	I trade for boards and the one I have now is from "loadedboards.com" though you might not want a long board (I'm old what can I say) look up all the sites on line and add to your search closeouts for anything you are shopping best price for. it always seems to turn up a location getting rid of stock of that one thing I am looking for from shoes to sports equipment, hardware, tools, even clothing and swords. if you know the model number put the name number and then closeout and hit search.|`|Tu7Ec3tDaa	never bought anything $60 or over...=] i'm somewhat cheap..<br>  <br>  just ask around... i know Almost's are all-around good boards... and the Impact Supports have AWESOME shapes..<br>  <br>  i also like Girl for their shapes but they don't hold up as good as an Almost.|`|v4daor9Kaa	probably my whole setup was like 180 and was dyrdek trucks and a cairo foster enjoi deck.
iWcTmuhAaa	100% agree.<br>  <br>  1-). TNA had the best free style wrestling in sports entertainment.<br>  <br>  2-). WWE had only two tag teams, TNA had a list of great tag teams.<br>  <br>  3-). WWE don't have any proper mid card section, X-Division in TNA had some real talent and most of them are hot too.<br>  <br>  4-). WWE is PG, but TNA is not. They still give a lot of extreme matches, and also had better hardcore wrestlers. <br>  <br>  5-). WWE is bureaucratic, they don't try new things. TNA on the other hand believe in innovation and contingency approaches.<br>  <br>  6-). WWE had 60% of bikini models that are good for nothing but to pose for playboy, TNA Knockouts are amazingly talented.<br>  <br>  7-). Most of WWE fans are little kids, they don't care about real talent so there are a lot of LARGER THEN LIFE gimmicks in WWE.<br>  <br>  8-). Every one in TNA had a good deserving gimmick, I don't think anyone there is underrated or overrated. WWE don't believe in equal opportunities.|`|Caf5W9nraa	I find WWE a bit better than TNA right now.<br>  I still watch TNA but I can't bear watching it for 2 hours honestly.<br>  WWE had been doing great since last year it had major matches and I think that this year with the exciting Randy Orton vs The McMahons feud and the possibility of HBK vs The Undertaker we don't know what would happen and with WrestleMania around the corner WWE's getting better than TNA.<br>  <br>  Seriously TNA to me just begins to annoy me now because of them firing Petey Williams but would pay if Kevin Nash's contract is about to expire.<br>  And the silly storylines with Samoa Joe appearing to the screens and "Dr.Stevie" we're not stupid we know it's Stevie Richards!!!<br>  <br>  It's your opinion that matters not mine just expressing it.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	I agree that the WWE does spend too much time promoting matches instead of actually having matches. i dont agree with TNA being better however. TNA still seems to be a little more generic in my view. but hey your right about one thing. it is getting alot closer between the two.|`|poc3xrCeaa	WWE has become stale they use the same matches over and over i cant remember how many times ive seen HHH v Orton or Cena vs Edge its just boring me now.<br>  <br>  I agree that TNA is better and hopefully they will continue to improve.<br>  Long live TNA!!!!!|`|TY6gyeC2aa	wwe is at its peak rigght now,same wrestlers intresting storylines. TNA has became embaressing now|`|bh8AjH3Taa	TNA sucks like Hell. Always did suck. Always will suck. They only have WWE's has beens or never beens and never will be's. Sometimes TNA goes searching for bums on the street. Hey ya wanna job bum.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Smackdown Raw and Impact all seem to have 6 matches per show so they don't actually have any more. I feel the opposite of you WWE is doing longer, better matches weekly while TNA is getting shorter matches with a lot more talking. TNA done right is better than the WWE but at the moment they are doing a great job shooting them self in the foot with bad booking and ideas.

br1kwegaaa	Right now, they are in the NCAA tourney.  Looking at the ESPN Bracketology bracket, Kentucky is a projected #7 seed at this point.  I agree that the Wildcats should be in the field of 65.<br>  <br>  They have key road wins vs. Kansas St. and West Virginia (granted, they were at a neutral site but those games were won away from Rupp).  They swept Tennessee and beat Florida at home.  They are 8-4 in conference play.  They are 4-4 vs. the RPI top 50 and have only 1 loss vs. a team outside the RPI top 100 (vs. VMI in the 1st game of the year). If the Wildcats make it to 21 wins (they are 19-8 right now) by winning 2 of their next 5 games (I am counting the SEC tourney), they are safely in the NCAA field.  <br>  <br>  The concern is that the SEC is not a strong conference this year and the Wildcats are #64 in the latest RPI rankings.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	Yes.

Charlotte Hornets moved to New Orleans for the 2002-2003 season.  Charlotte now has it's own team again....The Bobcats.  The Seattle Supersonics were moved to Oklahoma City last year and are now called the Oklahoma City Thunder.  Also in case you were asleep that long.....the expansion team the Vancouver Grizzlies move to Memphis in 2001.<br>  <br>  Players drafted in 98, 99 that are still playing and still impacting in the league: Nowitzki, Bibby, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Rashard Lewis, Manu Ginobili, Jason Terry, Rip Hamilton, Shawn Marion, and many others.  The superstars of league now are Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant, Dwayne Wade, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Deron Williams, Kevin Garrnett, Chauncey Billups, Danny Granger, and of course Lebron James.<br>  <br>  Now start watching again, and don't fall asleep for another 10 years.|`|h9ZRYMWzaa	dam* well tim duncans still good the hornets moved to new orleans and the new superstar is kobe bryant and lebron james|`|oYD9tDbpaa	I would agree, im a die hard Jazz fan, and have been for years.

r5AMG8g7aa	There are many styles of TKD. Plus there are many Americanized versions of it. Each has its own belt system. Some like the ATA have gone totally nuts. They have 15 color belts before reaching black belt.  There is no one answer to your question. It depends on where you train. And black belt is not the highest. Black belt has degrees. some styles end at 8th degree black belt. some styles go to 9th or even 10th degree black belt. Students have the mistaken idea that reaching black belt means that they are trained well. That simply is not true. Black belt is only a beginner. A black belt has learned the basics. It takes many years after that to really learn the art.|`|PfQOqlLhaa	pugpaws2 is right, when you finally get to the rank of black belt you are just beginning to understand your style. color belts are just basic movements. good luck in your journey.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Agreed that pugpaws is correct. In the origional form TKD belt system went:<br>  <br>  White<br>  Yellow<br>  Green<br>  Blue<br>  Brown<br>  Black<br>  <br>  Today you have schools that make money because they have anywhere from 10 to 15 belts which is not needed. TKD can be a valuable system but not unless you can find a good instructor. I honestly think that American TKD instructors are much better than Korean ones for the most part because many of the Korean one's I have met are very greedy and arrogant.

crhJLuw5aa	Its a fair ball if it comes to rest in fair territory before it reaches 1st or 3rd base, or if it's touched by any player while in fair territory. If it's a ground ball that first hits the ground in fair territory, it has to cross the plane of 1st base or 3rd base in fair territory. Once it does THAT, it's a fair ball even if it later rolls into foul territory.If it's a fly ball, it has to LAND in fair territory or, in the case of a home run; cross the outfield wall in fair territory. If it CROSSES the plane of the foul pole in fair territory, curves and lands in the stands in foul territory; it's a FAIR ball (and a home run).  <br>  <br>  As an example, supposing after someone bunts the ball, it rolls along the 3rd base line in foul territory but before it reaches 3rd base it rolls back fair and stops, or it's touched by a player. It's a fair ball.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	several possibilities.<br>  <br>  Within the infield:<br>    when the ball settles within fair territory;<br>    when the ball is touched by a fielder while the ball is within fair territory<br>    when the ball leaves the infield after touching the ground and is within fair territory as it leaves the infield (even if it then lands foul)-it would be foul if it crosses the foul lines before leaving the infield, before passing first or third base and not the bag itself but where the bag should be, in the event it is in the wrong place.<br>    when it hits a base (the bags, even if in the wrong place, are by definition part of fair territory) and then lands beyond the infield whether in fair or foul territory.  Home plate does not count for this rule although home plate is considered within fair territory should the ball stop on it or be touched there.  <br>  <br>  Note that the ball can return to fair territory after hitting a rock or umpire (who is considered part of the field) and be a live ball, but not if it hits a dugout or fence, or bat on the ground, or other foreign object.<br>  <br>  In the outfield (when it hasn't yet touched anything before arriving there), the ball is judged fair or foul based on its position when it does hit something or someone (or crosses the home run fence).  It is very important to note that it is the position of the BALL that is the key point.  A player standing in foul territory that reaches for a ball within fair territory and touches it will make the ball a fair ball because the ball was in fair territory when touched.  The reverse is also true (the ball is foul if touched in foul territory without regard to the location of the player).  This rule is a source of much confusion and argument but is really a very very clear rule.  Most people just do not remember it properly.<br>  <br>  If you play with one of those red and white first base bags, if the ball touches any part of the fair side, it would be fair.  The same idea applies to the foul lines, touching even the tiniest part of the line makes the ball within fair territory when it hit.  The line is considered part of fair territory and a ball is fair as long as even the tiniest part of it is within fair territory.<br>  <br>  I think that covers it all.<br>  <br>  There may be specific league or field rules that apply.  You can get the official softball rules off the internet.  Depends on what rules your league or game plays under, but these fair-foul rules are pretty well universal.<br>  <br>  Because you said a legally batted ball, that eliminates some possible issues as well.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Almost softball season again.  melt away snow, so we can play!!!|`|8870216fd83c9d98f0fbcb7a9ff9dc36aa	1. There is no such thing in softball as a fair ball, there is just a ball that is not foul.<br>  2. Any ball that is touched by a fielder while in fair terrority is a "fair ball"<br>  3. Any ball that is touched by a field while in foul terrority, that has not touched the ground is a foul ball.<br>  4. All legally batted balls that are caught by a defender are considered in play balls no matter where caught if they have not touched the ground.<br>  5. If a batted ball touches in fair terrority, then crosses third or first base and lands in foul terrority, it is a fair ball. <br>  6. If a batted touches foul terrority between home and third or first and then rolls or bounces back into fair terrority or passes over eaither base and land in fair terrority, it is a fair ball.<br>  7. Any legally batted ball that goes over the fence between the foul poles or hits a foul pole is considered a fair ball is then bases are awarded accordingly. <br>  8. Any legally batted ball that passes third or first base in fair terrority and hits the ground, then rolls into foul terrority or passes into an out of bounds area is a fair ball and bases are awarded according to the rule book, normally 2 bases from the time of the hit.<br>  <br>  Basicly in softball as soon as the ball hits the bat, and does not go into foul terrority, it is a fair ball. However, rule 10 states clearly if any unpire, plate or field calls a ball foul, it is foul no matter where the ball goes. That means if an umpire makes a mistake and calls a ball that goes over the fence, in the middle of center field a foul ball, it is a foul, and this has happened before. Umpires are only human and do make mistakes.<br>  Remember, any ball that comes to rest, touching home plate is a fair ball. Also, the pitcher's plate is not considered part of the field, any ball that hits the plate and not the ground, and goes into foul terrority without hitting the ground and then is touched by a fielder or touches a fence or dugout is a foul ball.

Don't think that record looks like luck. BTW, what will ManUre do when Fergie eventually retires?|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	He'll run out of luck, especially when you consider the fact that the 2nd leg is at Old Trafford.|`|AA10855783	United should have scored when they were on top. Could regret that. Inter were bad in that first half. Couldn't even centre the ball. Improved second half but will have to be better to win at Manchester. Still if they get 1 goal it could be interesting. Wasn't a good match in my book.|`|ZnYOB90gaa	You will see manutd at their attacking best, there will be no holding back!<br>  Inter milan are a defensive team and are to predictable.

Fergie thought he had a stronghold over English football, which Arsene Wenger would occassionally interrupt. <br>  <br>  But Mourinho was seriously good. Mourinho changed Chelsea from simply a good team to a ruthless machine. 186 points in two seasons. 6 trophies in 3 full seasons. He was truly special. He's won 13 trophies in his last 6 seasons. What can you say about a man who won the Champions League with a team like Porto?<br>  <br>  Just because United dominated yesterday doesn't make Mourinho any less special, and certainly not someone who thrives on luck. <br>  <br>  Can you say Fergie didn't have any luck? He was powerless in the Champions League Final last season. God knows what he was thinking when Terry walked up, and Ronaldo on his knees, face in hands. Only a god in the heavens could have saved Ferguson and Manchester United then. <br>  <br>  Something on a more miniscule scale took place last night, and Fergie was on the receiving end, that's all.<br>  <br>  In the end, those who are special make their own luck.|`|FPxXiabNaa	Be afraid that you didn't score an away goal. You were the better team on the night by far but Mourinho like you said is a lucky guy. He beat you with Porto before and knowing Inter, they will be the second best team on the night (same as Porto) and get a late goal.<br>  <br>  P.S.

fB8ujUVNaa	You could always go ghost rings, then get quick release raised scope mounts and still get the scope.Then if you bump your scope and knock it out of zero, then you just remove it and use your ghost sights.|`|4AbXxowTaa	Red Dot is superior in a reactive combat environment, such as Mosul or Sadr City.|`|AEzJHIz7aa	Ghost sights don't break.  They don't get knocked out of alignment.  They don't have batteries to go dead.  They don't add 3 inches to the height of your gun.  They don't weigh 5 ounces.  <br>  <br>  I've shot extensively with both.  Give me iron sights any day.  (Ghost rings are just enlarged aperture sights, which are still covered in the "iron sights" family.)|`|wdR8pPH3aa	For a shotgun I would stick with a ghost ring sight.<br>  <br>  If this was for a rifle or carbine I would say red dot.|`|43MMF0Bwaa	neither, iron sights are superior to both.|`|YtYoSH5Paa	Red dot sight isn't that special, but it improves your percision. I would go with the Ghost Ring.
Ad8m1dYXaa	I'm with Liam D. <br>  <br>  Melina vs. "Sensational" Sherri Martel vs. Luna Vachon.<br>  <br>  Bull Nakano would kill Melina, a better opponent for Bull would be Mickie James, Natalya "Nattie" Neidhart or Beth Phoenix "The Glamazon"...

She was a terrific performer in her day is probably the greatest female wrestler who can demand credit for her roles as both a wrestler and manager.<br>  <br>  Another reason I'd like to see them compete is for the pure humour of it.  When Sherri Martel competed in the ring or was giving "commentary" from ringside that woman sure knew how to scream! lol<br>  <br>  What i'd love to see is a screaming match between the two of them.  It'd be class to watch.<br>  <br>  But as an added bonus why not have Melina, Sherri Martel and Luna Vachon in a triple threat match?  Or put them up for a WWE Slammy Award for the Greatest Screamer of all time???|`|EAZv468Xaa	I'd say Luna Vachon.
k1C70y8raa	The light reflects off the snow, causeing you to get tan.  If it is sunny you may burn.  Usually if you are skiing only your face will be subject to these, and more often than not you are not greatly affected unless you are on a very elevated and open mountain.  I ski in the summer at Mt. Hood, Oregon, and I have to apply sunscreen every day, or else I would get fried.  Hope this helps|`|qyATAaeXaa	My skier's tan isn't as good as it has been in past years. I switched moisturizers this year and the new stuff has a SPF-15 rating. I got a great burn/tan last year while snowshoeing. It was sunny, 50F, and I was out in a short sleeve shirt. The snow reflects a lot of UV rays and will give you a sunburn. At higher altitudes it's even more intense. I've got sunburned on cloudy days while skiing too.|`|PEN3hha7aa	you can get a suntan from the ultraviolet rays even if it is cloudy outside.|`|fJbWRwsmaa	Well you can't get a tan if you are wearing a jacket and snow pants.|`|qYmDZbW2aa	Yea, I get tans/sunburns all the time while skiing.  The sun reflects off the snow.  Go for the super cool google tan.|`|EGKeYd0Waa	yea i always get a little tan when i go skiing
mGTeNxpJaa	Yes the learning curve for snowboarding is high. Unless you've already surfed or wakeboarded it will all be foreign to you. Alot of people try to realte snowboarding to skateboarding to begginers and truth be told it's not true to begginers. <br>  <br>  Few tips I've learned on the mountian...<br>  <br>  1. Take lessons unless you already know someone patient enough to teach you pay to get the basics. <br>  <br>  2. Have the right gear. Boots, Pants, Gloves, Goggles, Jacket, Beenie, LipBalm... Prioritize in the same order I mentioned. Your gear will be more important than what kind of board you are using. I say this because chances are you will rent a board for the frist time (btw you can get lesson and rental deal combos,including lift ticket, for a reasonalbe price). It's just better to have your own outerwear to avoid the funk.<br>  <br>  2. Try to fall flat (forward or backwards) Avoid catching your fall w/ you hands and avoid falling strait to your butt. If you have ever heard horror storeis about broken wrists and/or tailbones this is the reason why.<br>  <br>  3. Keep your knees bent as much as possible. It will be awkward but it helps with turning and speed.<br>  <br>  4. Don't get caught up in the "drama" of everyone else around you. Snowboarding to some people is a big ego session (you ******* know who you are) and will stir up bull **** against you to make them feel better. Just ignore them and stay focused on your riding. You are NOT there for them right???<br>  <br>  Most of all Have fun! Snowboarding is a beautiful activity once learned and respected.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|3O0F5s6baa	You won't like it that much at first, and might want to quit, but stay with it, once you're  good it'll be lots of fun|`|7KXNmD7caa	does it hurt when u fall?   LOL  LOL  LOL|`|CqB5ryTFaa	Snowboarding is awesome it is hard when you first start out and it shouldn't hurt when you fall because you should take it really slow at first.  Hope you have fun cuz if you start to do it a bunch you get better and it becomes soo much fun|`|nFNF0P7gaa	its not that hard,like skateboarding if you can skate down a hill you should be ok.
f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	A pedometer can only really give a general figure, a GPS training watch, (Garmin etc) would be more accurate, or do what I do. Measure it using a bicycle trip computer or car mileometer if you only run on roads. I have various looped circuits which I have previously measured so if I want a longer run I can simply add 2 or more routes that all interconnect. Beats an expensive GPS unit etc.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	I have found pedometers to be very inconsistent and have use 3 or 4 different ones. they are are based on your stride and if you change or quicken it it can't adjust. there are several sites out there you can map your run to find out if you can not afford a GPS which is usually accurate .<br>  www.mapmyrun.com  or www.runthere.com|`|e4984fff739610fd75449d66ba5516a1aa	Yes and it will also beep and vibrate when you pass by a child sex offenders house. haha!|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	no just the steps u take a day|`|ToxDHYsaaa	Hey i have a good website for you, a pedometer can not be exact, and is better for slower exercises.

0E57aoN6aa	It's kinda weak actually, My brother started a defense man and as soon as he was on the AHL team Manitoba Moose, he was given an A. But I have played 2 seasons with the NHL Toronto Maple Leafs and they haven't given me anything! I lead the league in scoring in that one too. So i think you have a better chance getting the A with a D-man and the C with being a veteran with high statistics.The only thing that helps with being on a crappy team is being promoted to the NHL faster.<br>  Try being on a team with an old captain who will retire? or captains at the end of their contracts.|`|TmDLyzAUaa	When you get and "A" or a "C" on your jersey it either means Assistant Captain(A) or Captain (C). So that is what it usually means. But you might want to ask your coach just to make sure. Hope it helps you out!! :-)|`|fudmYesMaa	I think its all pretty random.

h9ZRYMWzaa	here's what they should have done= NOTHING THEY WERE IN THE EASTERN CONFRENCE FINALS THE LAST 6 YEARS THOSE IDIOTS|`|f931be7e45f5d51817c8a31a462b08d4aa	It was a bit of both.  Billups was the captain of the team, and in addition to be being a great PG he was a great leader too.  Now that he is gone Detriot is desperately missing what he brought to the team.  Rodney Stuckey definitely could have studied under Billups a little while longer (look at how timid he is playing right now).  As for the coaches, I am not surprised, Detriot has a habit of firing the coach in a tight situation......remember how Rick Carlisle unfairly got the shaft, and Larry Brown got run out of town, and he helped Detriot win the championship.|`|sNQrJ6cfaa	Frankly i don't know what is happening to Detroit. I know BIllups had a huge influence on the team but if you look at it Billups got traded like on the fourth game of the season but the Pistons were still playing reasonably well. They had won 21 of the first 32 games. Now it seems like the chemistry is just not there and they lost 15 our of 20. They desperately need a team captain again. I wouldn't blame this on the coach, he can only do so much.|`|DDQ8tCnpaa	trading billups. idiots.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I say it was the Billups trade. They started off the year really good and even put the wood to my Lakers on the road. Everything came crashing down after the trade.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Because Iverson DID NOT FIT into Their SYSTEM|`|Njom1Wbtaa	Here are the main reason why the Pistons is in trouble right now:<br>  <br>  3.) Without Coach Flip Saunders, running wild, screaming with temper and staring to the referee like he's going to kill them. Their mettle was daunted, it was decreased to a bubble almost can't be seen on the naked eye. It was just wrong for them to build a new chemistry.<br>  <br>  2.) The trade of Billups made an impact, not because he is Mr. Big Shot or something like that. It's because he's the "General Clutch" of the Pistons, he was so fitted to the team, and can adapt immediately that he led the Pistons for five straight Eastern Conference Finals. He can defend even Lebron James, as we seen on the 2007 Eastern Conference Finals, even though he didn't stop him, he forced Lebron to difficult jump shots and lay-ups.<br>  <br>  1.) The most important part is their ennui. It had been a deja vu for them, except their winning of the championship. I think, they were thinking that it will always be the same, it will be forever all right. I don't think so, with the defending champion, Celtics and the resurgence Magic and Cavaliers, this right now, must neglect that boredom of theirs. <br>  <br>  Overall, they should have made a trade, it was so sad for Joe Dumars to be greedy of the 2010 free agent signing, he would regret it for the rest of his life.|`|hmrqHVtPaa	Those guys are as stupid as Mark Cuban, no I think they are bigger idiots than Cuban for trading a finals MVP, there was nothing wrong with the team, and made an unecessary trade.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	The trade.|`|f9f5eb7a2590ee5242a18dc42abeef7baa	billups was the perfect pg for the pistons.
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure it's a cool twist to Y2J's heel character and a very entertaining storyline that eventually leads to a match at WM 25 vs another respected Hall of Famer.The storyliners are looking at Chris Jericho vs Stone Cold Steve Austin in the Texas Rattlesnake's farewell match.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	i dont like that storyline|`|2hFfkqmsaa	I like it, I think its a good buildup to WM 25. I think its interesting how everyone thinks he will be facing Stone Cold. I believe he will actually be facing Hulk Hogan, Vince knows that he should involve the man who actually made Wrestlemania what it is today, like him or hate him Hogan is the single most important figure in WWWF/WWF/WWE and Wrestlemania history. I wouldn't at all be surprised to see it end up a lumberjack match with about 20 or so legends surrounding the ring, and Stone Cold as the special guest referee. At least thats the way I would book it!|`|yvtGL6RTaa	i see a match between jericho and austin at WM25 comin from a mile away!!! and jericho is a douche|`|KfqGPJe8aa	Its lame!

f931be7e45f5d51817c8a31a462b08d4aa	What is wrong with them is that they should have never gotten rid of Billups.  His leadership looks to be sorely missed in the locker room.  The team does not have the chemistry it used to, no one is happy.  Iverson is already acting like he wants out, and Rasheed is glad he is a free agent at the end of the season.  Stuckey obviously needed a little more time to groom, he can't play well under pressure.  And I don't bad for Rip hamilton, he should be stepping up right now, but instead is seems as if he is ignoring the whole situation.|`|GswnLKtQaa	no billups and iverson doesn't fit.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Everything,the trade Iverson-Bullups was awful.Iverson is a scorer and great passer and dribbler too i respect that be didn't fit well in the Pistons.Bad defense from one of the defensive team in the nba and bad chemistry.They don't have Bullups to play and pass more and he knew to control the tempo but no they're paying the price|`|q2EafutHaa	iverson ruined the team chemistry, They only brought him in to free up cap room. His contract expires at the end of the year so that gives detroit financial help. It was a mistake though to bring him in. He's not a great team player. He's not a great passer like billups. He's not a good shooter like billups. But he brings charisma and points. It's not just iverson's fault though. Everyone on detroit is getting older. Rasheed is not the same and neither is Mcdyess. Rip is on the bench for some reason. They need some fresh new players. This is definitely not their season.|`|YhfMrppSaa	Mistake after mistake. Trade for AI and Billups. Now u got Eddie Curry who done nothing. Rip in the bench, all a mess.<br>  <br>  <br>  I dont see Pistons winning a 1st RD playoffs.<br>  <br>  <br>  I dont want to see Cavs or C's playing Pistons at 1st RD<br>  <br>  <br>  Neither fellow Pistons fan<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Avery Johnson is the key for Pistons success.

WrDGhduxaa	I have always done track because I enjoy it.<br>  Plus I was never good at tennis.<br>  You should do what you enjoy doing the most.<br>  Track is much harder physically and tennis is more skillful even though it does require physical ability.|`|8A1m7YkMaa	I personally like tennis because I don't like running as much as tennis,<br>  but for track, I'd only do 100m sprint or javelin since my endurance isn't the best.
LtIhkOWiaa	I find the front foot in a shoveit does absolutely nothing but get out of the way when the board is turning.<br>  I setup for a shoveit with my back foot in that sweet spot where the tail meets the rest of the board, and pop and scoop down on there.<br>  <br>  As for the full motion itself, I crouch, start to jump, as my knees are coming back up to about half-bent, I pop and do the motion with my back foot, bring both my legs up so my knees are parallel, then try to catch the board with both feet simultaneously when the board has span 180.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|Tu7Ec3tDaa	you can pop a shovvy way high without even using the front foot... it really does nothing except catch it after the board rotates fully..<br>  <br>  just keep it out of the way and it might take a bit of muscle memory time but i bet my gumdrops you'll get it...

pjYn6PbCaa	The best years of my life were spent coaching kids.  The worst years of my life was watching parents destroy them.<br>  While the children are exploring and having fun the parents are busy trying to heal childhood  wounds.

I coached in wrestling, baseball. soccer and football.<br>  Leafsfan has obviously never coached and is one of the parents we are talking about.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Nonsense.<br>  <br>  The majority of sports parents are good people who understand boundaries and just want their kid(s) to participate and learn important life lessons.<br>  <br>  However, in every sport (and I mean every sport) you have the lunatic fringe.  Unfortunately, covering the 95% of parents who don't act like morons is boring, and it's easier covering the one idiot who thinks their kid is the next great thing, or wants to live their life through their kid's sports participation.<br>  <br>  Hockey parents get a bad rap, but their soccer, baseball, football, basketball, tennis, lacrosse brethren can be equally moronic.|`|1ApbWVhsaa	Leafsfan nailed this question but I'll add my one cent in(Damn economy)<br>  <br>  ALL sports have lunatic parents.The worst I have seen is football.Parents yelling aboot their kid not getting playing time,complaining that their kid is the next Joe Montana so he should be the QB..I have seen parents run out onto a field after another kid after he made a great hit on "Their Joe Montana" and go after him.TRUE STORY<br>  <br>  Baseball I have many horror stories-Parents waiting for Umpires after a game because their boy "The next Greg Maddux" threw strikes and he called them balls.<br>  <br>  The problem is-Some Parents are reliving their childhood through their kids and they will stop at nothing to make sure Little Jimmy will be something they couldn't......A Professional athlete.They want that payday just as much as the kid..If not more.|`|QQqhzuNDaa	A sport that promotes brawling on the ice is going to attract the bottom of the barrel.|`|QSShHlRiaa	First sammie stay out of this catogory please.<br>  <br>  And to answer your question <br>  its most sports. my dads always screaming at me on the ice.<br>  and on the field in every sport i do. but then you hear the other parents yelling at their kids becuase you just denyd them a goal or hit a homerun off of them. its pretty funny when other parents from the other team do it. but not really when its your parents.|`|jBXutMblaa	When I played soccer, parents were ridiculous.

vSuWyrFTaa	Sheena, I am a gun collector and do a little bit of trading and selling from time to time. Today's markets are rising and there is a lot of discussion about what the current administration will do to gun control in the future. As a long term investment yes I would say that fire arms are a decent investment. If nothing else you should be able to break even on them. <br>  <br>   If you do some shopping around and look at estate sales, garage sales and even coworkers who lose a family member or friend who hunts; you can come across some good deals. I have in my personal collection two older Colt pistols one is made in 1909 and saw action in WW 1 and the other is an original 1856 model. Most 09 year models list between $700 and $1200, mine is unique in that it was carried by a member of Lafayette Escadrille and is insured for $5000. The other I bought from a friends friend who lost his uncle and didn't want the pistol, I won't tell you what I paid but is insured for $12000. <br>  <br>   Over the years I've found old flintlocks, military weapons from around the world, and even a Singer made 45 ACP. Buying guns for as an investment can be fun, but it can also be expensive if you get carried away.|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	They can be. Like any investment, you have to do your homework and buy wisely.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Yes, especially semi-autos likely to be banned within four years.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	why just to all the guys?!?<br>  girls know about guns too<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but to answer your question- a gun/guns are a good investment- it's our right to (says so in the 2nd Amendment). we have a right to bear arms (by bearing arms, we have a right to protect ourselves, have fun shooting, hunt, and many other things (but any harm done with a firearm is not justified))<br>  <br>  the simplest answer is yes but to go any further than that, personal opinions will get "thrown in" too<br>  <br>  OUR 2nd Amendment is not just about hunting though|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	When something goes bump in the night in your living room or a crackhead comes at you in the parking lot of Walmart, they are a very good investment.<br>  <br>  Remember, the police are just minutes away when seconds count.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	Indeed, they are very good investments provided you have some basic knowledge of which guns to buy, how much to pay, and take good care of them. They can give you a good return price.|`|nBUDjyhgaa	For the most part, they aren't an investment like stock.You won't get rich.But if you ever REALLY NEED it, a $40.00 .22 is priceless for defending home & family.|`|4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	Kind of a tricky question to answer, they will hold their value, but they tend not to appreciate unless the supply of new ones have been altered (see assault rifle ban which drove up the prices of pre assault ban weapons.)  Magazines have value because of the limited supply, they are becoming increasingly valuable right now because some believe they are going to ban the manufacture of high capacity magazines, but I do not have faith in it.  Ammunition have been a very good investment for myself, I bought a lot of it for 80% or less of what it is going for right now, but I do not plan on attempting to play the markets.<br>  <br>  <br>  Guns are a poor monetary investment in that it will be difficult to profit enough to make it worthwhile, but they do provide security and are a cheap insurance in case something bad happens.  The biggest thing about buying material goods is that it provides a hedge against the declining value of the dollar and it will likely remain stable in price unlike things such as Gold which are being constantly traded.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  to the guy bragging about his pistol being worth a 1000 dollars, you do realize that 170 was worth more in 1970 than 1000 is in present day?|`|AA12243350	if you purchased them already, they are a great investment since prices have skyrocketed. But only buy quality firearms, not cheap junk.<br>  If you buy now, yes, they will still be a good investment if you take very good care of them, but I don't think they will skyrocket again, until the new anti gun laws go into effect. The down side is, many types may be banned or made illegal to possess, so you have to pick carefully what you want to invest in. I'm not advocating breaking the law, but if certain firearms are banned, the "black market" for them will be very much active and prices will still be very high.<br>  The biggest problem now, is that prices are high to purchase because people panicked and have been buying them up like made to avoid the possibility they will be banned. Make sure you also purchase magazines and ammo (if you can find any) to fit the firearms.<br>  good luck and shoot safe|`|AA11295048	Guns can be a very good investment in more ways than one. I bought a used Series 70 Colt Government Model with the Satin finish in 1977 for $170.00 to replace this pistol today would require around a $1000.00. Also, if I ever need to defend myself or family when things go bump in the night this Government Model is deadly accurate and still is as beautiful as the day I bought it.|`|ca92b64c79c7a08eb9a59b00b8d5e493aa	They CAN be a good investment, and not just in a monetary sense...<br>  <br>  Some weapons increase in value due to rarity; others have value because it's there when you need it.|`|wdR8pPH3aa	Yes<br>  <br>  Better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it.|`|Ui2WJH4Iaa	a very good investment?  no.  they probably will only keep up with inflation.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Yes *|`|HJTs6qppaa	He is absolutely correct, if you buy smart. Certain collectible "Firearms" appreciate in value more than Real Estate.|`|BXSlZEfBaa	In strictly monetary terms, they are similar to jewelry or tools. Most people do not buy them for the purpose of resale. However, if the need ever arises to turn them into cash they will usually bring the majority of the sticker price back as long as they were well taken care of. Some will actually appreciate in value if they become rare or a collector's item. The greatest value a gun brings is its uses, personal defense, recreational shooting, and hunting.|`|iHFHH71Iaa	If you take good care of them then they do not drop in value as quickly as say maybe a car. once you drive the car off the lot it is worth half as much. If a gun is in perfect condition its probably worth 80% or so of it's sticker. If you use it a lot then it is not a bad place to put your money if you can swing it I would. (I really like guns though)|`|YdOfpXkoaa	yes it is an excellent invesment the good thing is that you don't need to invest alot of money out of it and you will get lots of money. good luck <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	Yes buy all you can !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|bgxYKsGiaa	ya  have over $60,000 in them
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I think the WWE storyliners could book another angle where John Morrison wins a match to qualify for the MITB match at WM 25.I think he deserves the chance to compete in the match, especially after last year's performance and that amazing moonsault with the ladder.Or the storyliners could book him and The Miz to defend the Tag Team titles vs Carlito and Primo instead.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	no|`|GJsIZeUIaa	There will more than likely be a battle royal closer to Wrestlemania to determine the final competitor in the Money in the bank ladder match.

9bf27d9c7d3d63fd350e1063b6507711aa	I personally think it simply goes all the way back with the departure of Hleb and Flamini. <br>  I knew Arsenal would run into trouble once Wenger decided not to replace those two players for like to like. <br>  Fabregas worked best when he was giving that space Hleb and Flamini provided, plus the passing between was pretty good. With them gone, Cesc has struggled a bit since now the players around him don't give him that same space and has to work harder with the ball. <br>  <br>  If you want to put blame somewhere.....I would say Wenger . <br>  I personally feel he has this Ego that things needs to be his way...and he wants to win the league his way.....No one fears Arsenal anymore....they aren't an intimidating side to play....and their lack of experienced players is haunting them at the moment. Relying on too much younger players for a 38 game season is an unfair burden for those players.  <br>  <br>  Injuries are part of the game,....Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United all had injuries to some of their big role players as well....Arsenal should have the depth to handle this...<br>  <br>  I still think Arsenal can finish 4th or even 3rd. I don't think Chelsea are out of danger yet and this is all new for Aston Villa. They have the UEFA Cup to worry about.....so as the schedule gets tighter....possibility of slipping up is greater.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I think we will still finish 4th yes, it'll be tough but i think we can do it.<br>  Our squad has been riddled with injuries and the players steeping in to cover these casualties just aren't good enough at this level|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	there's nothing wrong,ok it's not pretty nor is it exciting but i believe in that arsene knew we had no chance of winning the premiership after we lost to hull,but at the same time he is protecting the younger players from exposure hence why the midfield so lacks imagination,the only hope arsene i believe in the silverware is the big one CL,nothing else matters to him as you saw yesterday which they completely dominated roma,i have no doubt that now we are defensively sound and when the big guns are back we will storm the rest of the season and then it will continue into the next season,so just be patient and we be laughing out loud soon|`|PD3qATQtaa	I think its personally alot down to Wengers policy on youth and his refusal to not keep faith with the players he's bought. Anybody can see a player like Marcos Senna would give Arsenal some great balance and experience but he believes in his squad. <br>  <br>  He maybe right three or four years down the line when most of them become a more polished article but that doesn't help much now does it?|`|QDXnM1l6aa	IT ALL COMES DOWN TO INJURIES MATE.ALSO WENGER'S TACTICS ARE A BIT CRAP.FOR INSTANCE ,HE ALWAYS PLAYS BENDTNER NOT AS A  SUB BUT FOR THE WHOLE MATCH  BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT HE RARELY SCORES WHEN PRESENTED WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES HE DOES AND AS A RESULT ,ARSENAL DOESNT GET THE WINS THAT WE SO MUCH NEED<br>  WENGER HAS THE SQUAD AND THE POTENTIAL TO FINISH 4TH BUT NOT WITH THE WAY HE USES HIS PLAYERS|`|a76b38d0164ef927c918e56023d08abeaa	They never had Alf Garnett as manager.|`|e4478f08249c4cf9e1fe4f544b626018aa	Being a gooner I trust in Arsene . However I fear for our fourth spot. I dunno when it exactly went wrong but this is my opinion. Arsene system of not buying and using young players is a good one but not when you're fifth. He had the money so he could have spend a bit on the midfield... I still believe that we can make it , have faith|`|ptP0E0Y2aa	Always Have Faith In Your Team And The Manager, Wenger Always Bounces Back like A Couple Seasons Ago We We're 12 Points Behind Man Utd And We Came Back to Win The Title, So Jus Shows Wenger Knows What He IS Doing.<br>  And It All Went Wrong N Downholl Wen David Dien Left|`|ceef93d1024d0e6a2e214650ffb17d50aa	When they sold Flamini, Hleb, Let go of Gilberto, and failed to keep experienced players.

The other half of the Jason Kidd trade has become more of a star than anyone could have forseen two and a half years ago in the NBA finals. He become a huge scoring threat, and the drive behind the Nets offense. Though the team are still fighting for a playoff spot, they are over-achieving from what critics previewed at the beginning of the season, and Harris is one of the main reasons for this. Although he has cooled off from the scorching start, he is undoubtedly a great player now, and that has been recognised this week. If Devin wins the award, he’ll be the first M.I.P to play in an all-star game since Gilbert Arenas in 2003.<br>  <br>  Danny Granger: Indiana Pacers<br>  Last Year: 19.6 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 1.0 BPG<br>  This Year: 25.8 PPG, 3.4 APG, 1.4 BPG<br>  <br>  Just a few months ago you could have made a very worthy argument that Granger didn’t belong in this list. But a whole heap of game-winning buzzer-beaters and some unbelievable scoring later and he has to be the biggest challenger to Harris. Granger has jumped all the way to fourth on the NBA scoring list, and emerged as the undoubted spark of his Pacers team. He is all that keeps people interested in this team who so far have earned the ‘giant-killers’ award for the season. The more amazing stat for Granger? He’s doing this all on 36 minutes a game. Grangers play has been so amazing that his team’s woeful record wasn’t enough to keep him off of the Eastern All-Star squad this year.<br>  <br>  WINNER : ???|`|YhfMrppSaa	Mo Willam<br>  <br>  <br>  Rajon Rondo<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Kevin Durrant<br>  <br>  <br>  Nate Robinson<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Devon.

Sports helmets are made to protect your head from impacting with the road, snow, trees, etc. etc. <br>  <br>  If you are doing a sport like ski-mountaineering/snowboard mountaineering, you can use a snowsports helmet on the climb. Otherwise, get a climbing helmet for use around the rocks. It will be lighter and cooler. Many snowsports helmets are insulated. Make sure your climbing helmet meets CE and/or UIAA standards.

That way you have supervision, the problem with this choke is unless you are really experienced you can put someone out quickly and not realize it because you are only looking at the back of his head. Seriously properly doing this choke can put some people out in as little as 2 or 3 seconds, so while you are just trying to see if it works, you can put someone out quicker than they can tap in some cases. I've had some people with incredibly low choke tolerance, or people who basically had a high heart rate prior to slapping the choke on. They attempt to hold off for a few seconds to keep someone honest and they go out quick.<br>  <br>  In short, without really being able to show you, you are flexing your arms together. Think that basically you are trying to bend your arms as much as you can, (both of them). Basically trying to touch your own shoulder with the same hand.. <br>  <br>  You know how you flexed when you were like 5. Where instead of having your arm at about a 45 degree angle to have the muscle pop up, you just squeezed your forearm and bicep together.<br>  <br>  You are basically doing that with both arms. If you are extra mean you are also pushing the head forward with the arm/hand that is behind it, though it isn't remotely necessary.<br>  <br>  Please don't practice this on your buddies, learn someone with some supervision so you don't hurt each other, as it doesn't take much effort to do so.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Ask your martial arts instructor to teach it to you.

FpJ2qvrCaa	Was Mike as drunk or high as Joe Rogan when he said this? I mean come on he already whooped Hendo and if they had a rematch i think it would be worse than the 1st time that they fought, and for Bisping haha <br>  are you kidding me, Bisping has a shot of beating Silva not even close, I dont even think that Bisping could beat Rich Franklin, or Wandy now that he dropped weight classes.|`|5TIX6PH3aa	I think Luiz Azeredo will give Anderson his 1st loss since it happened in 2000.  If you mean his first loss in the octagon, I think Henderson has a better shot than Bisping does.  Bisping is primarily a striker, Anderson loves that.<br>  <br>  I was at the first fight with Henderson, Hendo owned Anderson the 1st round.  But Hendo also likes to swing for the fences and tried to trade with Anderson in the 2nd round where he got caught and Anderson was all over him.  If Hendo had kept to his game plan, he had a chance to win last time.<br>  <br>  Out of anybody who has already competed for the UFC, I think Nate "the Great" probably has the best chance right now.|`|5Ni1V8FGaa	micheal bisping don't stand a chance against silva. if henderson gets him to the ground and keeps him there i think he could beat silva. i don't even know why bisping is even in the race to fight silva. he has not fought anybody at 185 to prove his ability. bisping needs to fight wilson gouvia or someone of that caliber to even be thought of.|`|3q8LkLLDaa	1st loss???<br>  boy he has 4 already go do ur research|`|NHAKOXyXaa	I dont think so silva has the edge in the stand up and ground game against both this fighters. i think lyoto has the best chance if theyll ever fight, to win against silva u need to smart. big dan and bisping are good fighters but they just won;t much up well with silva.<br>  <br>  Mike goldberg is stupid he must go back to nba tv, he knows nothing about analizing mma fights.|`|CQbnVjUuaa	His NEXT loss not FIRST loss will in my opinion come from a 205lb opponent.Some one like Lyota Machida who is not a stupid fighter and would match up well with Silva....As for 185.......Hahah where did Lutter go?? He is the only one that even troubled Silva...Too bad he couldn't make weight.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	if I remember right Henderson gave him a little trouble but did not go in there with the right game plan in my view.   I would not mind seeing a rematch there.  As for Bisping his skills have continued to grow but I agree with you that Silva would destroy him more easily than he would Henderson.  I would like to see Frank Mir or Rashad Evans fight him as either one of those match-ups with him would be entertaining to watch.|`|ceGeKMyTaa	I agree with people who have said if Hendo actually stuck to his game plan he should have won the first fight. I think he could pull it off, but then again 185 lbs is not really his best weight. If he can figure out a way to cut weight without completely draining himself he would give Anderson all he could handle for 5 rounds. <br>  <br>    Bisping actually has the size and skills to be able to at least give Anderson a good fight standing up. I am not sure he would be able to beat him! But he would not make it really easy for Anderson the way others who just run at Anderson and end up becoming a part of his highlight reel.

I have yet to shoot some of the ballistic silver-tip and partitions since factory cost is insane and I haven't shot up what I have reloaded yet.

35aa6dcf3de4ecb9aa30d3c58ec123edaa	I remember this angle which involved Stone Cold chasing Booker T around church back in 2001, it's silly that Booker T made a mockery by acting as a priest doing confessions and running around trying to hide from Stone Cold but it's hilarious espacially the confession part and Stone Cold repeatedly saying "What".|`|3m9DQuDRaa	I can name a few...<br>  <br>  Super Hero In Training - Hurricane found Rosey wanting to be a superhero, and so he decided to train him...  which basically was training him to be a boy scout...  helping old ladies cross the street (which ended in Rosey being beaten with a purse), walking a grouping of dogs (which ended with Rosey being hit by a car... or something), and some other stupid things...  usually culminating with Rosey explaining that he was an S.  H.  I.  T....  and then him getting hurt because of it.<br>  <br>  Val Venis vs. Kai En Tai - Back in the attitude era, they were actually pushing Val Venis...  and in a storyline he apparently recorded a porno with the wife of the Kai En Tai manager.  The manager was so pissed off that he swore that he would "choppy choppy Val's wee wee."  They caught him, yanked off his shorts, and with a katana swung down on Val's no-no spot...  And missed.<br>  <br>  Mark Henry's baby hand - Another badly planned angle with Mark Henry had him becoming the world's largest ladies man (later re-used with Viscera)...  but after failing at getting a bunch of women, he finally found love...  in one Mae Young.  He realized that his love wasn't as kosher as it should be and planned to break it off, but Mae suddenly announced that she was pregnant.  In a so-bad-it's-not-even-funny moment, she went into labor and gave birth...  to a rubber hand covered in pink jello.  What.  The.  Hell?<br>  <br>  The J.O.B. Squad - For a short while, the WWE had no idea what to do with Bob Holly, Al Snow, Blue Meanie, 2 Cold Scorpio, and Gillberg...  the entire group (minus Holly) were actually ECW draftees at the time, and all they did was lose.  Snow made shirts backstage that read "Pin me.  Pay me." as a joke, and it got over so well that they turned them into a stable...  The big joke was Gillberg...  perrennial jobber, Duane Gill got his head shaved, and looked like a mini-goldberg, and to make fun of the push of Goldberg in WCW, they had the JOB Squad escort him to the ring, only for him to keep his ridiculously long losing streak alive.  His first win?  The Light Heavyweight Championship.<br>  <br>  DDP is my mentor! - After DDP's heel story against Undertaker failed miserably, they tried to repackage him as a self help guru.  His cheesy dentured grin led to some ridiculous promos of him making people feel good about themselves with the line "That's not a bad thing...  that's a good thing!"  This lead to a story about Christian having a horrid losing streak, and throwing temper tantrums in the ring whenever he lost.  DDP came out to help him...  making Christian do the ridiculous smile, too.  Hilarity ensued...  leading to DDP winning the belt that Christian was going after (European title) and Christian STILL losing in the end.  It was weird.  But funny.<br>  <br>  Glammarella - Santino and Beth was just a confusing setup.  Santino had just broken off from being an overbearing boyfriend with Maria...  telling her that she wasn't woman enough for him...  and quickly found "love" in Beth Phoenix.  She was so much woman that she became the man in the relationship...  even winning the Intercontinental title for her man in a tag team match.  Santino continued to win by fluke, even bringing about the Honkameter (which was by far one of the funniest ideas ever)...  but sadly it all ended with an unceremonious loss to William Regal, who seemed to be stealing EVERYTHING from people...  the King of the Ring from CM Punk, Jamie Noble's girlfriend...  and now the IC Championship from Santino...  But they're still together to this day.  Long live Glammarella!|`|6LQNK51uaa	Stone Cold Austin bashing Vince in hospital..that was hilarious but stupid at the same time<br>  <br>  Limo explosion and death of Vince.....lol that was the stupidest angle|`|gfxXikenaa	McMahon and Hornswoggle angle|`|3ExtDP45aa	Spirit Squad!|`|Q1MI6L96aa	"Captain Jack" in the infamous Lost in Cleveland angle on WCW, where Cactus Jack suffers a memory loss, is suspected to be wandering the streets of Cleveland, Ohio, and is later found telling tales of his "adventures" on the high seas to a kid.

This should help it has me, <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This tells you how to become a Christian, and how to go to Heaven <br>  <br>  <br>  John 9:31<br>  Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  John3:5 <br>  <br>  Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Acts 2:36-38<br>  <br>  36Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. <br>  <br>  37Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? <br>  <br>  38Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost|`|5TIX6PH3aa	Well that depends.  Lifting 3x a week is not going to pack on muscle weight very quickly but over a long period it will.  If you are looking to gain quicker, go to the gym more but do not workout every muscle group every time.  <br>  <br>  I used to do:<br>  Day1: Chest and tri's<br>  Day2: Back and bi's<br>  Day3: Legs<br>  Day4: Chest and Shoulders<br>  Day5: Bi's and tri's<br>  <br>  You also have to make sure you are taking in enough protein, carbohydrates, and fluids (protein builds muscle, carbs give you energy and will help to keep the intensity of the workout, fluids are needed to breakdown carbs and your body the water for a ton of functions).
9G0kQAoEaa	Arsenal are going backwards due to Wengers reluctance to use his chequebook instead he expects to have instant succes with young players which is nigh on in impossible as to be successful you need a mix of youth and experience and the star players to mix together, The reason Aston Villa are where they are is simply because they have been far superior to arsenal this season and it unfortunate that they have such a small squad as they could do well in Europe this season as well|`|HxET88bDaa	Erm...|`|e6TD1j1gaa	arsenal is building their team for the future, in about 3 or 4 years (maybe sooner) the Gunner are going to be dangerous.

The roos lost Harvey, the worst possible player to loose in a time like this and it will cost them dearly.

Did he then trash the "Old ECW title"?|`|Q1MI6L96aa	That was stated by Jerry the King, Flair, HHH and others when the original ECW was in business, so it isn't shocking or controversial. <br>  <br>  It pushed WCW and WWE to revise a number of ways they did business, but ECW had a litany of problems, including the timely payment of talent, distribution of sold merchandise (and quality of tapes) to fans and protecting indie talent that appeared for a one-off spot in a house show from possible injury (I know of one individual who worked twice for the company and ended up using his pay for the night - plus additional money - to be treated for concussions).<br>  <br>  Swagger is wrong from a fan's perspective, but correct when looking at this purely from inside the locker room.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	He is entitled to his opinion, some people didn't like Heyman's ECW.

I like the current ECW as well, it's not the same but it's still a good show.|`|GJsIZeUIaa	The current ECW is not all a joke. Look at guys like Tyson Kidd and Christian who are on top of their game.

After all, CFC went to the final last season anyway.|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	1-0 Chelsea, with Quaresma scoring late.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	I Dont think that it will end 0-2 for JUVE<br>  <br>  But Juve Will throw Chelsea out|`|op4fEbEVaa	Chelsea will win.
Cl6KbcAGaa	I have a pair of DT Swiss X430's and a pair of Mavic Crossmax SL 's and both are equivalent in workmanship and have taken a beatting on two bikes that I use frequently. Both are used for XC more or less and the DTs would be better for Freeride and DH over XC . Either way you will do fine as both are a solid wheel but make sure that your fork can handle the 20mm thru axle that the DT Swiss comes with before you buy! Your weight is fine for either one but I would go with the DT Swiss if I were you as a first choice.
AukGqk17aa	magic johnson is better of course|`|21J0IIZbaa	I would pick Magic over James always.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Now<br>  Magic is better,HE"S a LEGEND<br>  But if LeBron is great and keeps better and better evryyear<br>  who knows<br>  maybe he will be better|`|9iB1AiQlaa	Magic Johnson. He changed the game of basketball and revolutionized his position as a PG. He was the first ever PG that was six foot nine inches tall. <br>  <br>  LeBron is good no doubt, but he is still a young guy and needs time to prove he is great.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	For Now MAGIC<br>  <br>  He Was Awesome And Could Do Everything<br>  <br>  He is The Best And WEIRDEST PG ALL-Time<br>  <br>  <br>  But Who knows Maybe LeBron will Be Better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Add  5 Thumbs DOWN   HOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW...|`|kjJkQpzPaa	Are you serious? Lebron James is so much better.<br>  Magic if amazing, bur Lebron is too much to handle.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	LeBron.|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Earvin "MAGIC" Johnson is a better POINTGUARD.<br>  LeBron James is a better SMALL FORWARD.<br>  <br>  Magic is a playmaker and LBJ is a scorer. They have different roles in a team so we can't really compare them.|`|wf3S2avqaa	Lebron James is the man without a doubt. But Lebron you gotta long ways to go my man before you are on level, style, grace, showmanship of Magic Johnson. <br>  <br>  Magic Johnson all the way.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Magic Johnson|`|FlOTIfhbaa	Magic|`|op4fEbEVaa	Lebron is better than Magic|`|5ANmjtLOaa	Magic Jonhson hands down.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Both are equal,but I pick LeBron|`|1IG4GdGqaa	Magic Johnson. It's pretty simple why. you ask anyone young or old who magic johnson is and even if they aren't a basketball fan often times they know who he is. Most young fans know who Lebron James is but he isn't a world phenom yet.for the Playing aspect, it's hard to compare because they played against different competition and in different positions. Magic was the better player though.|`|f931be7e45f5d51817c8a31a462b08d4aa	Magic and Lebron both make the players around them better, but I think Magic could do it better.  After all, Magic does have 5 rings.<br>  <br>  Lebron is great, and knows how dazzle, but I just don't see how him and magic can be truly compared.|`|EbJMwdAEaa	So far, I'm still sticking with Magic Johnson. His career says it all. LeBron has still a lot of years to spend. The comparison comes in when LeBron is already retired. LBJ has still several things to come.|`|h9ZRYMWzaa	magic's better but by the end of lebron's career he'll be better|`|toGUFbisaa	magic was able to take his teams to the next level, lebron is great dont get me wrong but i dont think he's that type of player yet|`|zqrimtrnaa	magic johnson the greatest Point Gaurd Ever.

Oj9ITMSFaa	Well they got craig bellamy!|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Yes esp Kaka haha he def did!!!|`|XU1KaWXwaa	they relised it was man C and not man U|`|ToxDHYsaaa	nope but there still end up higher then you at the end of the season and look at how many players you have!!!    Us and you are a lot different were building a team where as your buying one, i'll be more then happy to finish 17th. You give it all this about man city when you've spent over 50 million!! when you have players like, bent, huddlestone, modric, pavlyuchenko, campbell, lennon, jenas and a strong defence those players would get into any team. Your team is a joke! Your manager is a joke and you as a fan is a joke!|`|GjpWEu6Raa	they aint got enough money to buy aston villa                                                                          DAVID VILLA ...............WHO'S SHE..?|`|XUe07RPGaa	Yeah they all signed, undisclosed fees of course.  Serious competition for places up front for City now- and remember, the Zimbabwean world beater is still there too  ; )    But still got a rubbish back line, so it will seem as if Kaka, Villa, Messi, Ronaldo, Santa Cruz, Ronaldo and Adriano aren't there at all.|`|HtsowwHBaa	nope    they sign bellamy tho    lol|`|AA12370193	English Knight gets worked up about these comments...|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	As City found out, money cant buy anything. Looks like theyll have to play their way into the top 4 like last year with Sven, if they expect top players to give the team any respect at all.|`|huto12P3aa	when they all heard of the interest, they were told 'manchester' want to sign u. so they all thought oh yea id love to play for the european champions man utd. then david beckham rang them to tell them it was man city, not his former team.|`|m2zXOREJaa	Terrible aint it-mind you you got Chimbonda who assissted in 2 of your goals-did you win lol   Inside left ,outside in, we both got turned over off teams we shold be beating. you could'nt make it up.lol|`|V0I3Ar8Yaa	they decided the likes of messi or kaka are'nt really gona help them break the top for so they went for good old bellamy in the end who in my oppinion is a world class player!
bNykcEVXaa	No, No, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!?<br>  <br>  plz keep him!!.. he has been an inspiration to us this season... his press conference inspired us more than SAF's  hairdryer treatment...this season<br>  <br>  <br>  dR bad<br>  I wish he'd try putting the heat on us.. (and Refs in our matches) more often....lmao|`|xU7AaQOdaa	Bookies don't normally get things wrong do they?<br>  <br>  I think that this would probably be a good thing in the long term, as over the last two months the wranglings, rantings and results have turned a great club into a laughing stock!<br>  <br>  The 2 Americans are going nowhere unless they can sell, and as Parry is protected by them, Rafa cannot win whatever war he is making.<br>  <br>  If Rafa does go, then much has been said as to where that leaves the likes of Torres, Reina and Alonso- the "Spanish Contingent". Would the best thing would be for King Kenny to come back as General Manager, with Roberto Martinez working close with him as a "Senior Assistant"?|`|kxMQXhuAaa	A William Hill spokesman seems pretty certain that he'll be gone by midnight on Sunday.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.teletext.co.uk/Football/" rel="nofollow">http://www.teletext.co.uk/Football/</a>|`|D7Dubtt9aa	See ya rafa but who next eh|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	watch Torres and co follow him at end of season|`|GjpWEu6Raa	LOOKS THIS WAY------><br>  <br>  <--------LOOKS THAT WAY<br>  <br>  *THINKS FOR JUST A MINUTE..!*<br>  <br>  <br>  BETTER START GETTING THE GAGS READY THEN LOL
D7Dubtt9aa	Marco you are a adult you are moaning about childish people then say livershit. Manure is used by a couple of liverpool fans pathetic names for liverpool are constantly used.      Marco your a good bloke but you are being as childish as the people reporting you. Chill out and stop trying to spend your days winding people up|`|fEWhwumZaa	We give as much as we take on the whole so do carry on :)|`|q71osfkiaa	I always thought Liverpond was much funnier than any of the other **** you write.    FQ: I don't report clones like you.    Edit says LOL shows how calm you are. Indeed you are.|`|AA12370193	They reported my question exposing some of them as hypocrites (you know it right?). It was the second time too.   The Problem told me to get a life, must have stuck a nerve there.. I have absolutely no doubt he was one of them who reported me, he does it as much as he can, and a couple trolls trail him at all times too. I could block his childish remarks and arguments from my questions but, whats the point? I want all to see.|`|Q3hOqlOTaa	I have pretty much made it clear that I think "manure" is very 6 year oldish.    You call them Livershit? I didnt even notice :P|`|aZXnW6AUaa	very funny|`|LdJFFvSVaa	They're hypocrites!

4DcvpQXfaa	I miss KG & Marbury duo again<br>  <br>  Bad Boys LOL|`|xm2ZxPXXaa	i know that marbury has bad issues on and off the court, he might just pull of a dennis rodman if the celtic organization can pull it off,<br>  dennis rodman had problems with san antonio spurs on and off the court also but helped the chicago bulls to 3 championships!<br>  anything is possible!|`|oMYGtqubaa	What people FORGET is that Marbury came into this season in GREAT SHAPE... GREAT ATTITUDE...   It was management that just never wanted to turn the page... and they kind of embarrassed him at a time when I believe he was TRYING to do the right thing.<br>  <br>  And while I understand management not wanting to deal with him... they chose the WRONG path at resolving it this season.<br>  <br>  <br>  I DON'T believe Marbury will try to sabotage anything...  I think his reputation is so tarnished that people BELIEVE things might happen before they actually happen.|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Stephon is already 32 y/o and haven't had any ring yet. He wants to join the Big 3 so that he too can be remembered as part of the history. He is aging and his game is deteriorating, just like KG, Pierce and Allen, he wants to have a NBA Championship under his name before he retires. Let us give the guy a chance, maybe gone are the days that his ego is higher than his basketball skills. And I love to see a team that is full of supertars to win the NBA Championship, a feat that LA Lakers haven't done when they got Shaq, Malone, Kobe, Payton, etc.|`|Tl40qXrzaa	Marbury certainly isn't the player he used to be, but he is in a contract year. That dude loves money and fame, so you would think he would buy in this year to land a contract with someone and play for a couple of more years. <br>  If he pulls his Knicks routine, then he's done in this league. <br>  <br>  No risk for the Celtics, they just cut him and be right back where they were.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	I hope Marbury just screws over the Celtics & ruins their team chemistry. I would love for that too happen. c[ : jk jk<br>  <br>  I think Marbury will perform somewhat good with the Celtics. He won't get much playing time at the start because of Rondo & House though.|`|GjJmNOg1aa	no one can mess up the celtics chemistry i live in boston and i am a celtics fan i am happy to have marbury hes a beast!|`|kioPLqGTaa	I think it is bad move they already won a championship without him last year
3teWTOPqaa	Knicks are going down tonight. Having Odom at the 4 will give Lakers speed to defend Knicks in transition. Andrew might slow us down in this game or he can dominate downlow, but either way I believe the current Lakers roster are better prepared for jump shooting teams like the Knicks. Plus Lee is going to get his a$$ handed to him by Gasol.    EDIT: If the Lakers win, all the Knicks fan will be like "well we are suppose to lose anyways, so it's not impressive."|`|xhHfXuKFaa	yeah it does. we stunk at rebounding in the finals without bynum. plus he was hot before he got injured.|`|2kgTdNRQaa	The Lakers are going to bury the Knicks tonite.  Trust me.  And if Bynum is present, Knicks get buried twice as deep....|`|xeEOTsyYaa	Karma...|`|i5MInqeMaa	There is only 4 teams that the Lakers need to be full power to beat (Cavs,Celtics,Magic, maybe Spurs).  The Knicks are not one of them.  Lakers should still win this game.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Keep dreaming skippy.|`|AA12338050	Bynum is that great.. There are better players out there. just my opinion...|`|GNGzJ1pAaa	He looks to be a little bit injury prone.  Not very good news for lakers fans.  Or fantasy owners|`|uGVGmAbXaa	i cant believe steelers won dang it|`|8z9Rcx3taa	I don't think it's an excuse. The Lakers are one of the deepest teams in the league, and yes they did make it to the finals without Bynum. Lame excuse if that's the one they're going to use.    Now, if my Rockets could stay healthy..|`|xDDNCKvlaa	That's what he gets for hospitalizing Gerald Wallace.|`|2IQ9RJtvaa	Bynum rather watch games from a hospital bed.
LCY4X5GDaa	IN:-    OUT: Jermaine Pennant, loan (Portsmouth), Krisztian Nemeth, loan (Blackpool), Craig Lindfield, loan (Accrington Stanley), Robbie Keane (Tottenham)|`|V0I3Ar8Yaa	this is what i heard on sky sports news that we were trying to get saviola who plays for real madrid i think on a loan deal but i really dont think its gona happen. in the end a successful transfer window for us bought no-one and let go of some one we bought only 6 months ago. rafa should have done a swap or quickly bought some as if torres gets injured we have no other players up front in the same league as torres|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	You have sold your only back up striker and have bought no-one.      but you still have Ngog,  (chuckle)|`|p8lB73rdaa	There's a rumour that the window is now closed until the summer !|`|XU1KaWXwaa	robbie keane gone thats all.|`|kxMQXhuAaa	No,sorry.Just Keane going back to Spurs.    And the window isn't closed,it's been extended due to the weather.
NNn84vTCaa	10. Chris Sabin - As a Tag Team and as a Single Wrestler, Sabin never fails to amaze me. As a singles Wrestler, he is brilliant, just look at his match at Genesis against Alex Shelley, best friends make the best matches. Sabin is just an all round guy, hes entertaining in the ring, puts on quality matches. His Cradle Shock is just devasting, i mark for this guy.    9. Tyler Black - While im still annoyed Aries cost him his title at Caged Collision, Black is great. The Age of the Fall thing he needs to lose, but, in the ring, he is incredibly talented. The thing about Black is he has charisma that has the potential of leading to greatness. And i find that more entertaining than anything. He can carry the torch for ROH, imo.    8. Eddie Guerrero - What can i say? Funny, Charasmatic, and Talented to no end. I cannot get over how hard it was to decide were to put him in this list, but Eddie was so entertaining for me. You know, just when he was would shove a chair in Matt Hardys hand, then fall the floor pretending to be hit, to win the match, hahahah that was funny, lol. But i loved every moment of Eddie Guerrero. Viva La Raza!    7. Stone Cold Steve Austin - When I was a kid I could remember watching him on TV with my brothers. He was an icon and, he really did bring back a lot of momentum (at the time) for WWF and wrestling. Whether it was kicking Vince McMahons butt, or wining the Royal Rumble 3 times, Stone Cold managed to satisfy me every Monday Night. The stunner and slamming two beers will be forever ingrained in my mind.     6. Mistico or Alex Shelley - This was tough, and i have to say both. Misticho is the very reason i watch CMLL. In my opinion, he is one, if not the best high flyer today - feel free to disagree with that. 'La Mistica' is an epic move, and honestly, the guy is awesome. Alex Shelley, big MCMG fan, and big Alex Shelley mark. He is one of the best All Round Wrestlers, he is hilarious, and his promos are funny. His in-ring work is stunning, and i was a big fan of him in ROH, so that makes him even better.    5. Mickie James - Okay, one of the top 10 female Wrestlers in the World, as Alexis Laree. Its shocking people say Trish is the best, especially when you have Mickie James! I love watching her in the ring, and i mark for her, and i pray she wins more than 7 titles. Her ROH stuff was great, her TNA stuff was great, her independent circuit stuff in general was *great! She has bags of charisma, and her feud with Trish was hilarious 'Do you think im psyco NOW Ashley, DO YOU!?!' hahahahaha. I wish WWE would give her more time on the mic, but damn the girl is hilarious!    4. Randy Orton - Hmm, you may disagree with this lol! But, i love Randy Orton, i may be biased because he was awesome when i met him, but i love watching the guy in the ring, and i actually find his promos entertaining. I see Randy as an anti-hero, which is why i liked Stone Cold, its like in the Movie, you cant help but like the bad guy (ie; The Joker!). He has Charisma, he has talented, how can i not like him? Maybe its just because im picky, but Randy Orton is another Wrestler who never ceases to amaze me. When you are put over by The Undertaker, its hard not to like you.    3. CM Punk - What more can i say? One of the top Wrestlers in the US. And arguably, the best Wrestlers in WWE. Im a huge mark for his indy stuff, my favorite match being Samoa Joe vs Punk II - second best match in ROH History btw! Punk is just a god in the ring to be honest, from the Pepsi Plunge to Welcome to Chicago Mother f*cker! Punk is great in the ring, and consistantly puts on beautiful matches, which can only be described as 'so pretty'. Im a Punk mark, i proudly admit that, and he is one of the very few people who kept me watching ECW, and right now, Raw. He can cut a promo, so to the people who say he cant; Pick up a ROH DVD! He has the best mic skills in WWE, and we only saw a glimmer of them when he won his first world title in the 'E. 'Straight Edge means he is better than You!' is another reason i love him, he has a great gimmick, and im a big fan of his heel character, again in ROH. WWE please turn Punk heel!    2. The Undertaker - Were do i started? I grew up watching this man, and this is why he is here on my list, the only reason he isn't number 1 is because of Jeff. How often do you get a nearly 7ft guy, who can actually Wrestle? Until he feuded with Mick Foley and lost his manager in 1996 that he became something other than a zombie who's character essentially foced him to do nothing in the ring, and actually developed some real character beyond that, which people could relate to (the betrayel by his long-time manager, giving him a bucket load of sympathy with the crowd, allowing him to act more "human"). In the last 4 years he's really become one of the best workers on the planet, and you'll struggle to find a better "big-match" performer than Mark Calloway. Hell, anybody that can make as ridiculous a move as Old School seem purposeful deserves all the freaking praise they get. And his gimmick is/was one of best in history. Its very, very rare you find a Taker hater, and when you do, they dont even have a good reason to hate him. Bow down to the Dead Man.    1. Jeff Hardy - Umm okay, this might be long, it might be short. But the fact is, even though i watch all these promotions, and have been a fan for 12 years, i find Jeff Hardy more entertaining than any other Wrestler. People make personal attacks on Jeff for his style of Wrestling, the likes of Rey and Kofi use ropes to deliver impact matches, so why cant Jeff? Just because Jeff Hardy uses top rope, high flying moves, doesn't make him any less of a Wrestler. Let's not forget that Jeff Hardy can also go 20 minutes in matches, and *shock & awe* the fans actually stay awake and entertained by them. Which is another reason why i thinkt he guy is freaking amazing. Even haters cannot lie|`|Fc3MLDzmaa	The Rock  Stone Cols Steve Austin  DX  Chris Jericho  The Benjamin  John Morrison  Shelton Benjamin  undertaker|`|n55Vb81Faa	1.The Rock  2.RVD  3.Randy Orton  4.Chris Benoit  5.Bret Hart  6.HBK  7.Kurt Angle  8.Eddie Guerrero  9.Shelton Benjamin  10.Edge|`|WtcTBlccaa	1.shawn michaels  2.steve austin  3.ric flair  4.bret hart  5.the rock  6.chris jericho  7.the great muta  8.sting  9.owen hart iam not a nugget  10.mick foley|`|bSsBGrZVaa	1.

It inspired other gimmicks like Vampiro, Crow Sting, and Rellik.    9. Eric Young: I admit when he played as a paranoid character I was entertained by it and plus he is good on the mic aswell.    8. Kurt Angle: Ever since he went to Tna I have been a huge diehard Kurt Angle fan. His feuds with Jeff Jarrett, Samoa Joe, Aj Styles, Christian Cage, and Abyss have been awesome.    7. Jeff Jarrett: I really enjoyed his heel run back in 2006 where people were throwing Garbage at him but it gave examples of how far fans can hate a heel.    6. Mick Foley: The man is fun to hear on the mic, he can sale anyspot you tell him to do, and he can still play a good face/heel.    5. La Parka: When the man dances, and does a comedy role in a match I quickly get into it and am entertained by it.    4. Aj Styles: This man is defiently TNA. He can make any wrestler good plus he works hard to get back in the big spot.    3. Stone Cold: When I first started to watch wrestling I defiently became a fan of this man. You didn't know what kind of mood he was in on each episode.    2. Edge: Probably one of the best heels in this business today. Enjoy this man while he is still here.    1. The Rock: While Stone Cold was out of action this man entartained with his mic work and let me just say he can get a crowd going when his music starts.|`|LVrH8W57aa	well for me they are :    Alex Shelley .. the man is so freaking talented its amazing and he is still so young, he has great charisma and mic skills and amazing high-flying mat wrestling skills, the man is a future legend, he can play both  an amaing heel to a great face , he is awesome!!    Melina .. i just LOVE this girl, love her!!!!  she is soo good on the mic and she is sooo good looking, what i love about her matches it's that she shows me almost every time she gets in the ring a NEW move, she has like a million moves , i just love to watch this girl    Jushin Liger... arguably the best high-flyer ever, but he is also 1 of he most underrated on the mat, he is my favorite masked wrestler, i also think he is the best lol, he is so freaking amazing, he inventd the SSP, without him there wuld be no high-flying, he also came to tna and entertained me there also in an amaing match against Pete Williams    Mick Foley ... huge fan of this guy, i love his promos, i love the emotions he shows in his promos, but for some reason everytime i hear him on the mic he seems to me like he is going to cry lol, well the man is a hardcore legend, he takes risk, and even if he is washed up and old , when he wants to have a match with someone .. especially a hardcore match, he brings out the best in him, just look at edge vs him at WM 22    Lita .. my favorite female wrestler of all times , she is the first diva i saw do "high-flying moves" ,  she is the first diva risk-taker in WWE, she is hot , talented, great entrance, and i just loved to watch her wrestle    Sting .. the man is great on the mic.. good wrestler .. great charisma... and arguably the biggest name to bever work for WWE, he was my favorite when i was a kid, i loved to watch this guy beat a bunch of bad NWO people .. i really like him and i like his move set    Christopher Daniels ... the man is sooo underrated at promos and mic skills, he is sooo phenomanal in the ring, he indeed does have the Best Moonsault ever, he is so good , soo athletic, he has great promos and the fallen angel gimmik is really amazing and unique .. he might end up as the best wrestler to never win a world title    Cheerleader Melissa.... my favorite and the girl i think is the best female wrestler today, she is just so visious in the ring, she can work every aspect of wrestling and she has been in many different gimmik matches like cage, falls count anywhere, street fighs, last woman standing and others... she is really funny , llike here, she was really funny and entertaining : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_x9EHZ...    HBK : arguably for most people, the greatest sport entertainer of all times, he is amazing, watching him in the ring is like magic , he has such good mic skills, face expressions, his entrance and these song are great, he WAS HILARIOUS in DX, flat out Hilarious, he never disapoint me in the ring, and i always mark out when i see him do a springboard moonsault to the outside ..     Edge ... he is my favorite wrestler for a reason, the man is just a future legend, he has the best entrance i have ever heard, he has great mic skills, he has won 7 world titles in 3 yrs for a reason, it's because he is a rating machine, he seels tickets, he entertains the fans, as a face the stuff he did backstage with guys like angle were totally HILARIOUS, i LMAOed at each and every 1 of them, as a heel i love how he mocks the fans, like on the last SD, when he jumped and said : wrong! wrong ! wrong! ..just funny.  he has the best facial expressions i have ever seen, and when he becomes phsyco he is still funny, like what he did to vickie, he is also a great wrestler, watch his matches, he is an magnificent performer      **STARRED**|`|7BHIyMFmaa	In no particular order    1.

oMW2IYyGaa	They are both good. <br>  But I prefer Cech.|`|fddRY8Uiaa	Cech can't save penalties either. I don't think I've ever seen him save one. At the moment Cech has been a little off form since his head injury, but I think he was the best in the world before that. Buffon is pretty good, but I always rated Toldo as Italy's no.1 when they were both in their prime|`|bLHhNYTJaa	I'd say Buffon in normal goalkeeping. But Cech at penalties. Buffon can't save penalties for ****|`|0VYpCXz5aa	Gianlugi Buffon is better goalkeeper but he can never save penalties so if you want a complete goalkeeper it's Petr Cech|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	they both s**t.....|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Buffon by a country mile|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Has to be Buffon, Cech was never the same since that head injury and now he's slowing down too.|`|PrsbAjZAaa	Hard to say , Cech and Buffon are both legendary keepers , i'm obviously going to go more for Cech's side , BUT Cech's still very young for a goalkeeper , only 26 and most goalkeepers have there best year when there 30 odd<br>  <br>  <br>  personaly i rate them both the same , great keepers.|`|xegK7yhiaa	Gigi Buffon is the best. Did you see Petr Cech at EURO 2008? It was completely his fault the Czechs lost. And plus, Gigi Buffon is a decent golie, in goal, but 90 percent of penalty kicks is based on luck.|`|wrhqkEiMaa	At the moment, Cech is better because Buffon has been out of form since returning from an injury.|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	Buffon is better

Q2.Quaresma might go to Chelski.|`|4VgPiwRqaa	Hope Quaresma comes...  According to the Portuguese press Quaresma has been loaned out to Chelsea till the end of the season...  I'm not going anywhere even thogh the transfer window's shut...|`|c4GykfVkaa	definitely a cotton wool for torres=)|`|tbgaqgQyaa	cheap tesco wine and a dvd probably...   hes going to have a quiet night in. because he needs time to get his head straight and make winning (attacking) decisions like he did in the chelsea match (aka bringing on babel and benayoun to put pressure on chelsea)..   and not stupid decisions like substitute torres for lucas. ( omg ). . .|`|0MSPBRm6aa	Telling you the truth honey,  none of the above,  He would probably just circle around some low-classes bitches.  Otherwise, he gets laid in his gf hot-tub and take a night long bath.  Hey, you asked my opinion. There you go girl. Love it or hate it.  Cheers,|`|6FVEpMTAaa	Rafa is a smart guy he know what to do, he needs to by wool as much as possible to rap F Torres in. And then go and buy more wool for Torres Lol.    Also quaresma has signed for chelsea. Loan though.
hl9nqKQ2aa	Quite possibly, also with the number of portugese speaking players chelsea has, must make the choice easy for him, but is a fancy footed fairy what Chelsea need right now?|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Seems done according to Italian reports.    Btw, lmao I hope he performs better than he did at Inter bc he made Keane's move to Liverpool look like a bargain|`|duJgBxUoaa	Hmph :(|`|B7LyNQtBaa	No i don't think so.|`|huto12P3aa	Nah why would he wanna play under scolari over mourinho?|`|uXXbegw5aa	Oh, things always work out for your rival clubs don't they (apart from Arsenal hahahaha)|`|PrsbAjZAaa	According to most of the Sky Websites in Italy he's on a loan deal with view to a permanent move in the summer      finaly some good news|`|1VJkCsSNaa	man we have midfielder   we need a QUALITY striker   drogba is rarely in form|`|BA1TOMr9aa	Yes, but dont get your hopes up, he will not help chelsea, you will not win the title.
EIsnATLxaa	yh he has   http://msnsport.skysports.com/football/t...|`|TKDi70uTaa	latest news says he is at the club and the fee between the clubs has been agreed with personal terms being discussed.|`|3dPwxPSGaa	everythings agreed its just arshavin needs to pay zenit some cash-other than that its sound and shipped|`|B7LyNQtBaa	Signed.  They just have 2 go through the paper-work.|`|LCY4X5GDaa	Andrei Arshavin has signed for Arsenal. He will undergo his medical immediately.|`|mRF1xv7iaa	almost finished but i suppose you could say it has.    there is just a little bit of stuff between zenit and arshavin to be sorted and then the deal is done.    :)|`|cjNtjOZtaa	According to the BBC it looks as though it may go through .|`|tfotPdeZaa	sadly...|`|mKazB56xaa	No way|`|ubphtDAiaa	yes  hes come  but theyre still finalising it  coz of delay coz of the weather|`|nGpBuI9Oaa	NOT AT THE MOMENT :(    he is not payin zenit 2.35mil, if he doesnt he is back of to zenit
duJgBxUoaa	If Rafa leaves all hope is gone.<br>  Easy as that.|`|mK06dus9aa	Imagine if they win tonight and the owners sack him. There would be uproar. But if they lost 3-0 he would be easy to sack. <br>  <br>  To me it sounds like a betting coup, they start a rumour that he is to be sacked and then short it like mad.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Newspaper gossip, nothing more|`|JCRdicqXaa	Noooo. No.<br>  We need him to stay.|`|1IG4GdGqaa	If Rafa Benitez leaves, then their is no hope for LFC this season. I'm a huge Rafa fan and always will be.<br>  You'll  Never Walk Alone.|`|VjqNPLM3aa	No way man I don't believe you He sad that is he is happy to stay with Liverpool|`|2c8a44b459d8ba63e806f4879deb97efaa	hi there, im an Everton fan and i would love for rafa to stay on for the next 10 years. who can we ridiculed at if he leave:( <br>  hands up for those who loves the fat waiter's weird and bizarre decisions! may he stay in liverpool and make liverpool the spanish B team and send all the promising english youngsters in the liverpool squad to fat cat waiter school for the unwanted!<br>  <br>  Here's an ode to the only fat waiter in liverpool...<br>  <br>  oh fat waiter, u are so gluttonous<br>  but in a liverpool track pants , u r almost glorious!<br>  please dont leave us for we need u,<br>  for us to cherished, laugh and ridicule u,<br>  Ur tactical genius is as big as ur belly!<br>  but it is so bizarre that all eyes and ears are closed when it is shown on the telly!<br>  from all the other premier league teams,<br>  we hope fat rafa stays,so we can laugh at the liverpool team!<br>  <br>  everybody now.<br>  Fat Rafa, Fat Rafa oleee oleee oleee!<br>  we love u rafa, please dont leave us:(<br>  <br>  U'll never walk alone. just that ur company will be the unhappy liverpool mob that is going to hang u at the end of the season. lol:P|`|p8lB73rdaa	Rafa has brought this on himself .<br>  His rant about fergie was crazy , his team selections are crazy , his transfer dealings are ridiculous .<br>  The Robbie Keane saga made the club the laughing stock .<br>  We were in pole position to win the league and he blew it .<br>  <br>  Adios I say !!<br>  <br>  Edit , Tell you what , Draw up a list of Signings that Rafa has made , Tick off the ones that are still at the club .<br>  Add up the amount of money that he has lost the club by signing a player and selling him for half of what he paid for him a year later !<br>  A good manager doesn't leave Torres and Keane on the bench against Stoke !<br>  A good manager doesn't play Lucas ahead of Alonso or Mascherano !|`|cOPCNP7Laa	It has taken tooooo long for him to get the title. True on an improved performance but Liverpool could bring a decent manager to take over Rafa's "already built squad" giving him the same chances of success whilst possibly, in the eyes of Liverpool's management and fans, guaranteeing it's arrival sooner and with more regularity...
HtsowwHBaa	confidence plays a big factor in players performance especially if u're a striker. with the way rafa treated keane i wouldnt be too surprised if he's underperformed.   only time will tell if its another bad bussiness for liverpool, buy some1 for 20m then sell him back for 15m in 6 months time. i say he'd do well for spurs, he got pav to partner up front to share the burden, a role he's familiar with.   i wouldnt be too cocky if i were u, if torres should get another injury then u'd wish keane is still there to step up to the plate.|`|fmQIU0zqaa	Well, I wouldn't know exactly because I live in the U.S., but probably Liverpool would have the more insane club for buying Keane.|`|mKazB56xaa	No way|`|Pfq2zRejaa	good question is it confirmed we got 15 mill ?|`|jiFHJ6daaa	yes he is good.......didn't score never means bad player.........|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Liverpool, all that money and he only played how many games.? Must be the most expensive loan deal in history.|`|zJCWIWE0aa	liverpool, 20million for half a season. HA!|`|B7LyNQtBaa	Nahhhhhhhh.Tottenham did.  Cause he helped Tottenham alot.  But did he help.  Liverpool.  Zip,Zitch,Zero.Well actully 1 against the Gooners
smujlQLcaa	Yankees follow tradition when their Home.  Yankees are the only team in the league which hold this tradition at home games|`|zMvGnlMraa	They have never had names on either their home or away jerseys.  They were the first team to have numbers on their jerseys as well.  Other teams followed and put numbers on their jerseys. Yankees put the numbers on their jerseys at first by the batting order.  Earle Combs wore  1, Mark Koenig  2, Babe Ruth  3, Lou Gehrig  4, Bob Meusel  5, Tony Lazzeri  6, Leo Durocher  7, Johnny Grabowski  8, Benny Bengough  9, and Bill Dickey  10 were the original numbers and batting order.  Yankees didn't follow most teams when names were added to uniforms in the 60s.  Many Yankee replica jerseys have names on them but none were ever worn in a game with names.|`|GwawzO5Faa	Never in their history.|`|frDcAqyWaa	just the road ones, never the home jerseys.|`|iLQojxY1aa	Their home jerseys have never had numbers on them...they currently do have them on the road jerseys.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Never on the home uniforms, only on the road uniforms.|`|GDnVd270aa	as salty said they NEVER have had the names on the home jerseys...its a tradition. as far as he said about them having some on the road jerseys im not sure about that i would say that the never had them on those as well but im not sure about the road jerseys so don't quote me on those|`|tUIQEyczaa	neither jersey has names on the back of it, never have and i don't expect they ever will.   However, the yankees were the first team to start using numbers on the back of their uniforms during the early years of the game. They have kept the traditional jerseys since|`|yJ8DqPA0aa	NO neither Home or Road.   That what makes the yanks so unique and awesome.
6vzpHTqQaa	Best in the past: Milwaukee Brewers mitt logo  Worst in the past: San Diego Padres (when they wore the brown)    Best current: Toronto Blue Jays (cool hat)  Worst current: Tampa Bay Rays (everyone has blue in their logo; what was wrong with the forest green?)|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Best- The Rays    Worst- The Yankees|`|zMvGnlMraa	Best - Yankees    Worst - Red Sox|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	I think most are pretty cool. The brewers old school mits on the hats are real cool. I like the astros star logo and the jays look pretty cool.  The worst are probably the real plain ones like the rangers plain T and the Redsox plain B.|`|M0eyMvqlaa	Just check out my avatar and you'll have your answer.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Best: Phillies  Worst: Mets  Get the point?|`|k5zvA1X9aa	Best: Royals  Worst: Florida Marlins|`|195d481e791fe6dd37323b342df9fa94aa	best:  royals, dodgers, cubs  worst: indians, mariners|`|5xIroQjMaa	Definitely the Dodgers.

The White Sox are the worst
TKDi70uTaa	looking at the market there was not much available and seeing as the clubs who had these players still owed money for them i suppose it made deals easier. i understand your point but we have been awful this season and any addition is welcome at least we know what we are getting with keane, chimbonda and defoe and i am quite happy about palacios. go and warm your seat mate you are a yid end of.|`|B7LyNQtBaa	Haha.  Did he.  Curse the Irish man.  But they got him cheaper.|`|tfotPdeZaa	aww come on. cheer up. we got keane back and now hes realized that his home relle is white heart lane. everybody makes mistakes in their lives. its time to forgive (well when he scores us his first goal) =)|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	next jurgen klinsman|`|ToxDHYsaaa	Spurs are turning out to be an embarrassment, you have the money grabbing manager. As you said the guy who stuck his fingers up to you and left, defoe who is a top quality bullshitter and then chimbonda the worst defender in the premier league. I mean look at the quality your team has modric, lennon, bent, pavlachenco, jenas, huddlestone, campbell, bent, dawson, bale woodgate, the list goes on.... but still you struggle against teams like bolton, burnley, wigan, west brom and fulham. It really is shocking.|`|mKazB56xaa	No way|`|su9CEx0eaa	Dont think Ill be rushing to fill the seat!|`|21bf104810db24cdcc8e23a34e620563aa	Glad to have Keane back.  Think most of the fans will be glad to see him.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Keane did not stick two fingers up at spurs he was with us for 6 years and put in 100% the whole time... Then his Boyhood Team wants to buy him... He told the fans that he loved his time hear but could not miss out an opportunity to play for them..... It was the only team he would ever leave Spurs for.... Turns out the Manager there is a complete clueless tool... And his previous club has asked if he wanted to come back... He did... i am glad.... Bring on the goals...      THERES ONLY 1 KEANO!

VsyKJ5Ocaa	I'll go with the US roster over the second place Dominican Republic.<br>  <br>  The Dominican has an absolutely sick infield with Ortiz, Pujols, Jose Reyes, Soriano, and Tejada.  But the outfield is weak outside of Vlad, and pitching is even weaker, anchored by Liriano and not much else.<br>  <br>  The US team, on the other hand, has a pretty good infield of their own with ARod, Chipper, Lee, Teixeira, Utley, and Young...at least as good as the Dominican.  Their outfield has Holliday, Wells, and Griffey...a bit iffy but much better than the Dominican.  And I like Francoeur as a possible bounceback pick as a fourth outfield.  The starting pitching is Peavy and not much, but the releivers are phenomenal on the American team.  Nathan, Lidge, Street, Wheeler, Fuentes, Cordero...<br>  <br>  The US team definitely gets the nod here.
Jqd4g9pIaa	don't mind this if you are an Arsenal fan...  one thing i want to say is Weneger is really cheap man who cares more of money than class...  he thinks he is smart enough to make deals at very low prices for even high class players..  i mean he is really the biggest stupid i've eva seen...|`|373267de54a567ce4fdd303d84705891aa	its nothing to do with arsenal being cheapskates...apparently the deal fell thru cos zenit wanted arshavin to repay the loyalty bonus they gave him.|`|oL4IU5G3aa	What are you basing your assumption on good business practise or two cans of Stella|`|LCY4X5GDaa	because they are ru$$ian....LOL.better luck next time mate|`|duJgBxUoaa	Sh!t happens.|`|hl9nqKQ2aa	In some ways its amicable to see a club not surrender to his demands, i believe the deal is off because they are not willing to break to clubs wage structure, which in terms of the morale/money aspect seems to make sense.  Some if not most of other clubs that buy big are funded by the worlds richest men, while arsenal rely on 'normal' avenues tickets etc.  Then again what happened to Arsenal's record profits last season if i remember correctly lol|`|mRF1xv7iaa	wait for something official before you start slagging teams off.|`|tfotPdeZaa	thank god!! shava stays in zenitt!|`|QS5A9KR8aa	OMG are u serious?!|`|8Pw7ujG0aa	arshavin was in london though wasnt he? he's going to be a little peeved at having to go all the way there for nothing

kxMQXhuAaa	Don't we play Spurs on the last day of the season?.Are you thinking what i'm thinking?.    You're right though,Benitez treated Keane very unfairly.Good Luck to him.|`|InGWARz9aa	Bottenham need him lol xxx|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	Yes definitely.  He tried his best and is a good man.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	Definitely!!    I like Kuyt a lot- he works his socks off, but doesn't score very many goals as he is played in the wrong position.    I like Keane a lot- he works his socks off, but doesn't score very many goals as he is played in the wrong position.    Touch of irony there me thinks!|`|peFtORvUaa	I havent felt this bad in ages.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	I wish him all the best , hopefully he can find his feet at Spurs , Rafa was not helping him confidence wise either , As strange as it sounds he looked tense in front of goal , but that could;ld come back to haunt you on the last day of the season .|`|WzSwdv3zaa	i wish robbie all the best    personally i think he should of stayed until the end of the season|`|8Pw7ujG0aa	keane will score the winner in his next match against liverpool.. life is a b*tch like that|`|HtsowwHBaa	thats the least you lot should do after the way rafa treated him. the only mistake he made while in liverpool is trying too hard to impress his manager and fellow teammates. he works really hard on the pitch eventho he rarely played in his position.|`|Pfq2zRejaa	he wasn't good enough for liverpool football club but good luck to him he still supports us fair enough|`|tbgaqgQyaa	keane now has a point to prove. and i have a feeling he just might... all the anger might come out on the last day of the season i fear... he might play the most gifted game of his career that day tbh|`|q71osfkiaa	Yes I do. :)|`|uu3uVh9faa	Yes I do wish him the best of luck especially seeing that he's irish.  It's a shame really because given time, he could have been a big sucess at anfield.|`|tM2MN5NOaa	These managers are getting out of hand - spends all that money on Keane  and then won`t play him! - If I was the "chairman LFC" I`d make "Rafa" tell me why he asked for all that money and then not use him properly - MC doing the same thing - paying 18m for a player and then sends him out on loan - why buy them in the 1st place. These managers   need sorting out - If it was their own money I bet they would`nt do it - what a cheek. There all out of control. The player could`nt careless - he`s getting paid all the signing on fees.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	He was crap mate!|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Good luck to him, and I hope he remembers how to play football again now that he's back in London.

Eleven goals in eighteen appearences for the reserves last season, his first season in England. Let's give him a go.|`|EIsnATLxaa	we only use 1 striker so as long as torres stays fit we should last the rest of the season|`|p8lB73rdaa	No mate , he'll just play Torres up front with Gerrard in behind .  We're rightly screwed if Torres gets injured .  Considering how bad Kuyt has been lately I'd replace him with either Babel or Benayoun , not great options but has to be better than Kuyt who can't hit a five yard pass !|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Why now that Keane has gone???? Keane didn't play when he was there!!!
a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	I'm not sure Craig will find employment as an NHL head coach again.  There were issues with how he handled players while he was with Chicago and there have been rumblings that this problem has followed him to Ottawa.    I think it's rather unfortunate that a weakly talented team like Chicago (and it pains me to say that because I was one of the scouts that staffed the Hartsburg coached Hawks) was able to be 0.500 and make the playoffs under Hartsburg while a talented team like Ottawa continues to fall apart.    Knowing Hartsburg, I am sure he was part of the problem in Ottawa, but as a previous responder stated, these issues started once Murray gained control of the team.  Murray has a great track record in the NHL, and one day will be in the Hall of Fame, but his handling of the Ottawa Senators has left a lot to be desired.|`|hHXG8ef6aa	agree with you.... umm not too sure about hartsy finding another job in the nhl but i do think i will go back coaching the junior level. murray needs to do some major moves to shake up the sens or else he should be the one fired|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	Hard to tell, I mean they are in the basement now and most likely will stay there.....BUT....Trades are a coming I feel there is going to be some activity in Ottawa prior to the Deadline & they are only 14 points out of a playoff spot as of now.Joe you as well as I know 14 points can swing in any direction in this 2nd half of the NHL. Maybe it is the spark they need to get the ball rolling in the right direction....Maybe!!!    I've seen worse people get re-hired so I expect him to work again somewhere.|`|lYnkvRASaa	I wonder how long before Murray goes too?  This is crazy the common theme here as that the team has been crap since Murray became GM.    I actually expected it to be Murray who got fired, what does he have over the owner I wonder    Bob, I have been reading about that one in the Ottawa papers.  Its strange no reporters in Ottawa demanding Murray's head.  I would be.|`|WgTKHqlnaa	It is too little too late this season. I think he will find a job in the NHL again. I don't really follow the Sens much but is it really the coaches fault? I mean, everyone knows coaches get fired when the players are doing poorly since you can't fire all the players. Would any coach have that team in a much better position than they are? I don't know.|`|naZQqrNeaa	A little late, imo.  I say Craig becomes a commentator like the rest of the fired coaches around the league.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	The season was over for the Sens at X-mas. This change won't do anything to change that.|`|kuIT8OK9aa	Too late .    They need to fire Murray and hire Cliff Fletcher as GM.  He will get rid of the slaggards!|`|U8HSSSswaa	He'll probably get some work elsewhere, because if a team is looking for a new guy they'll go for guys with experience.|`|a4b1ec29a0974990f99d1acb4a268821aa	Yeah... a little too late but hey better late then never. Though I don't think it was really really his fault for how Ottawa's playing but I guess it was going to happen.    I think he'll definitely get another job here in the NHL.. maybe not as Head Coach but somewhere along the lines!|`|hQA6ZLjLaa	I say what a shame. Hartsburg is a great coach imo. Why not make a a statement and trade a player or two? Get rid of Murray too. Only thing that's looking good for the Sens right now is that we may have a shot at a top 5 draft pick.|`|LEQowzHCaa	I was not surprised...     I think he will get a job in the future with the NHL.The Penguins have also struggled and they are looking for a new coach. I think Hartsburg could go to the Penguins....    But, it will be hard cuz there are many good coaches available (Pat Quinn, John Totorellla, Peter Laviolette etc.)|`|AA12009752	ok i heard on one of the comments on a news site that it was actually brian murrays falt for not providing much for hartsberg to work with i disagree i just think as a coach no mater what you have in the dressing room you have to get your top players ready and give them moral boost to get there confidence back. usually coaches try methods of getting them in to game and hold practices to improve there players. As a coach you also need to be more strict at times and even bench them a few times till they know that this is not accepted in the nhl which is taking an off night not producing as much. YOU see ron wilson benched blake for few times and now he is on fire. But back to the question yes i think he can be back in the NHL if any other teams might need him. Maybe  he try vancouver pending on the status of Alain vigneault.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	No surprise. Too little too late. Yes, he will find a job again FOR SURE. Might be as an assisitant but he can get a job. Perhaps we see Quinn in Ottawa and Hartsburg with Team Canada Juniors again.     CDN Fan....Ask Mike Commodore about Marray! They have been having a little media war!|`|oJsrGmmPaa	I think he will. It's not so much his fault as it was the people higher than him. They should bring back Brian Murray as coach and GM, but have someone like Pat Quinn or Pat Burns (provided he's well enough) have the title of assistant GM. That way, Murray still calls the shots, but the assistant GM does most of the work with his skill under his direction.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Does this still mean they're not rebuilding?
Pc0QjrQ4aa	I'm torn on this one.  As tired as I am of being told by the braintrust of Western PA that Lord Crosby is the greatest thing ever (he's not), there is, as they say, two sides.  <br>  <br>  I'm not a doctor.  However, I'd like to put some perspective on this.<br>  <br>  It's entirely possible that he is literally having growing pains.  It's not uncommon for guys in their late teens/early 20's to still have this (especially if they mature late).  Two ankle injuries in consecutive years, a groin...it could be a structural/skeletal issue.  Or, it could be that his ankle injuries haven't healed, which puts additional strain on other body parts.<br>  <br>  Or, it could be that the grind of an 82-game regular season puts a huge strain on muscles.|`|AA12172407	Just another reason why the debate of who is better, Ovechkin or Crosby, is actually NOT much of a debate to me. <br>  Ovechkin is simply more reliable, and amazingly considering the style of game (hitting) that he plays each night.<br>  <br>  BOB- no debate  "to me"- imo|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Well, in my house, we just call him Cry-baby Crosby....he surely has been doing a lot of whining lately...but I think that is more about having to share the hockey spotlight with another young superstar who is getting the public's attention nation-wide...<br>  <br>  He's been used to getting a lot of attention, and he does NOT want to share the spotlight!  Whaa  Whaa  Whaa!|`|FYiKgeN8aa	Jason Spezza gets injured every year, but it doesn't seem to cause any huge outcry.<br>  <br>  Yeah it seems like Crosby gets injured every year, but give it some time.|`|MR9jlurbaa	Hey!  He might be a little soft now but he has played a lot of games in the NHL.  At least he isn't as much of a joke as say...GABORIK.  Injured EVERY YEAR.  if he would play a complete season think of the goals!!!!!  also Crosby sorta fought one time, and he fought in the majors so I will give him a little cred.|`|I5OKJKaRaa	HEY! he may be soft but he can kick ***!|`|jBXutMblaa	I'm sick and tired of Crosby all together.<br>  CryBaby needs to grow some balls.|`|Xl8CB3oEaa	crosby is a pussy.|`|ULw1777caa	Well at least he plays through the pain.  Most guys just sit on the bench like Semin.  He'll be in the lineup, the Pens need him.  You only hear about injuries to him because of his stature.  Get over it.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Crosby ONLY significant injury (that caused him to miss any length of time) was a freak accident where he slid into the boards skates first and had a high ankle sprain.......he had a broken foot......PLAYED THROUGH IT.....and aside from that he has missed literally a handful of games!<br>  <br>   Spaceboy- No debate at all? We'll catch up on that. I disagree with you, LITY disagrees with you, all the GM's disagree with you.........sounds debatable to me!

Also, Arsenal, Aston Villa, and Tottenham, big teams, will have to face both teams at their home-fields, which will have a big impact as well.|`|Bz5aeBKpaa	i think aston villa will win the trophy. but i am not sure who will have a big say that allows us to win|`|lYkvps54aa	Man Utd|`|JbPyP5GZaa	i thing west ham will
tM2MN5NOaa	According to Sky Sports - the player has a clause in his current contract that "he has to pay" his former club a fee if he moves on - he`s not going to pay that - he waiting for the new club to pay it (bloody cheek) and pretenting he doesn`t know anything about it.....yeh right. So add that on to the fee agreed and that becomes big money. would he be worth it ? If the deal goes through then the new club has paid the extra fee. and the player has got away with it....well thats football - everyone for themselves.|`|EJpywEFmaa	the deal is not completely off, but he has to pay 2million to Zenit St Peters Berg if he wants to join us gunners.

How many clubs has arshavin been linked with and he hasnt gone to any...spurs even offered 20mill in the summer and they didnt get him.  Apparently the reason this deal fell thru is that zenit wanted arshavin to return the loyalty bonus to them, which i guess he refused.

126986d456c7650b3fab46b5cfe905a1aa	I don't think so. I don't think Bosh would fit into Detroit. All he'll do is cause a controversy in the front court like they already have in the back court.    You know what I would like to see though? I would like to see the Lakers trade Pau to Toronto for Bosh. Especially since Bynum just went down for 6 weeks, they need a guy that can play inside or out. Pau is an outside player who doesn't like to play in.    But then again, if Detroit did get Bosh, they could play him at 5 and Wallace/Prince at 4 and play all 3 guards (Stuckey, Iverson, and Hamilton) and pick up the pace of the game. Question is who would they give up for Bosh? Probably Prince AND Wallace. But Detroit could go small, but that's not who the Pistons are. So I really doubt they'd explore that option.|`|pHacyTFhaa	I don't think Pistons are actively looking to trade Bosh, and if Toronto did trade Bosh it'd have to be for a cornerstone piece as it's hard for Toronto to get free agents to play in Canada.  The tradeable assets that Detroit has to offer are the expiring contracts of Iverson and/or Sheed, which honestly, aren't pieces that would be very enticing to Toronto.  You'd likely have to go for a young stud or something, though teams are holding onto those like crazy.  Maybe if Memphis chemistry fails you can try to get like Rudy Gay or something, but seriously, there isn't a whole lot you can build with, since stripping Bosh from the roster leaves it kind of hurting (O'Neal, Calderon, Parker, Kapono, Bargnani? ouch).  Sure Detroit would love to get Bosh, but only way Dumars can do that is wait for Bosh to go to free agency.  Latest rumor is Bosh wants out, but not that he's going to be traded anywhere.  It's because Bosh wants out though that Colangelo will have to look into trade possibilities for value, especially since they won't be able to get him back, unless they can get someone to come to Toronto that will make the Raptors good enough for him to stay.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	No ******* way they trade Bosh. The only way he leaves Toronto is by free agency, which he will to NY. Then the Raps would bring back Delfino and make the team revolve around Bargnani as he develops into the next Dirk.    guerrero you could so build a team around Bargnani he is having a breakout year and it takes time for All-stars to become what they are. Not everyone is LBJ23 or Garnett in their 1st years. This is Bargnani's 3rd year and he is showing flashes.|`|DkwgogXZaa	you can't build a team around Bargani...if the Pistons get Bosh...they'd give Cleveland and Boston a run for their money|`|GswnLKtQaa	Bosh would fit the Pistons, Raps are losing if bosh decides to leave it's up to knicks and pistons to do the biding.    I don't think AI would like to come off the bench...put him at PG and play Rip at SG, stuckey off the bench as energy guy. can't have both AI and stuckey at the same time...they both want the ball in their hands. Wallace has also been inconsistent lately espacially with his shooting pistons might consider trading him.|`|u94OIhfBaa	No.no,no,no,no NO! He'll be going to New York with King James|`|fHxpycJSaa	Bosh is a top 5 player. If Toronto trades him, it better be a blockbuster deal. They'd be crazy to trade him.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	NO The Bulls will get Bosh before Detroit does they want to get rid off Tyrus Thomas.|`|0dc69cce5a5ed1d1ee1b77b6595344b5aa	Trade:  http://games.espn.go.com/nba/features/tr...    Bosh said he is not reassigning with toronto in 2010 (http://dimemag.com/2009/02/chris-bosh-sa... so toronto should trade.    All of these teams benefit from the above trade. Detroit gets a young front line talent, and a three point shooter. Toronto gets two large expiring contracts, while still getting talent, and gets young bigs. The heat get a big with an expiring contract to help wade, while still being in the hunt in 2010.

He knows no other teams wants him but the Dodgers.|`|AA11565799	Manny hates Spring Training and often reported late for the Red Sox.  He may think that there is some advantage in waiting to let teams start bidding when they see their own weaknesses.  Only the Dodgers and Giants have expressed any interest so far, but you never know if the Yankees or Mets might not come out of the woodwork and try to sign him.  Manny hurt himself in the market by acting like a toad for 8 years in Boston more than he helped himself by playing great for 2 months in LA.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	LOl thats funny.

The pressure will start building up, and he will have to realize he isn't gonna get what he wants.  His agent, Scott Boras will most likely tell him he has already lost lots of value on the market and if he keeps his act up, we will lose even more.|`|ak5A435maa	i think Manny will get signed before the games, but not before pitchers and catchers report|`|lQYR7I9Taa	I think Manny is going to get signed before Spring Training games.  Although the Mets have been trying to avoid signing him, I think they will have no other choice but to do it.  The Mets need a hard hitter in the middle of their line up that could score them the runs they need even if the rest of the team is in a slump.  If the Mets don't grab him, some other team will.  Almost everyone in the world are greedy, and they won't let such a great and powerful player get away unsigned.  Managers will forget about his mouth and look at his bat.

All those others are great but not on the same level as Ware.|`|cdMKgBuXaa	Terrell suggs<br>   Any team any system he's a difference maker.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Demarcus Ware|`|CQcLHR0zaa	yeah Willis is a great lb one of the best i think<br>  <br>  idk if hes number 1 but hes def in the top 3 id say<br>  <br>  Ray Lewis is good especially as a leader but he is getting old<br>  <br>  I like Vilma too hes sick|`|Mci7lOhRaa	we gotta D!ck rider guys|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Demarcus Ware is the best linebacker in the nfl. He got robbed when he didn't win defensive player of the year, he had way more sacks than harrison and 6 forced fumbles when harrison had 7. but he can break the sack record this year and they would still give D player of the year to someone else because Ware has a star on his helmet which means you won't ever get the respect you deserve because the league hates the Cowboys. And that's a proven fact. Just look at the way the media treats Dallas players and organization compared to the rest of the league. Tom "face of the nfl" Brady dates two super models and knocks them both up, not much said or written, Tony Romo dates Jessica Simpson and it's all over ESPN, the NFL Network and every sports website. TO got more press when it was reported that someone said that they heard from someone else that got it from the towel boy that TO said he thinks Romo and Witten are making up there own plays than Plaxico Buress got when he shot himself in a NY night club where it is a felony to even have a gun. So, how is a guy ever going to get anything good said about him when all anyone ever focuses on are the negative with the Cowboys. D Ware is the best LB in Football hands down.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	LOL! You speak like the 49ers defense is great!<br>  <br>  I can say something though, the best NFL linebacker is not Willis, not Lewis, not Urlacher, it's either Ware or Harrison. By the way, Willis' stats doesn't even come close to Ware's and Harrison's.|`|5xIroQjMaa	I don't think Willis is the best yet. There are alot of impact Linebackers in the game that have put up better numbers consistently. However, it's early. Willis is a phenomenal talent the sort that you build a defense around. With Singletary coaching and crafting defensive schemes to take advantage of Willis' ferocious ability, he's going to shine. You give him another 2 years of seasoning and I think anyone will be hard pressed to deny his claim|`|UgnMjtYDaa	Harrison.|`|e4ekb1amaa	Although I agree that Willis is probably the best MLB in the game today, I don't agree with your reasoning...<br>  <br>  which is more impressive: Standing out on a team of bad players? Or standing out on a team of studs?<br>  <br>  SOMEONE has to make plays for a defense. It's inevitable. Even someone on the Lions will rack up a bunch of tackles and get good stats, especially if he's a decent player. You figure that there must be about 100 tackles in a game, even if the defense isn't good, it's not like they let the team walk through them. In fact in a good game, the defense won't even have the opportunity to make a lot of tackles! If they're doing such a great job, they won't be on the field much!<br>  <br>  Furthermore, if a defender is that great, he will make a defense great. Much like a great QB can make an offense, a great LB can make a defense. He can't do it alone, but if he can demand enough attention, other playmakers will emerge. <br>  <br>  Honestly, I haven't watched enough of Willis to properly evaluate him, but he seems much like a Brian Urlacher player from what I've seen - basically a tackle machine. Although that's useful for a defense, and can drastically improve it, it's not always a "gamechanging" role, which can hut his argument to be the best. Stewart Bradley for instance has greatly helped the Eagles D, but he's not really a gamechanger. <br>  <br>  Would I take a Patrick Willis in his prime or a Ray Lewis in his prime? Lewis is the obvious answer, but right now, Willis is making a strong argument for the best in the league. With a little more talent around him, I think he can grow into more of a gamechanger, and an all-time great.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "And saying a LB runs the defense and makes them great. A LB can only do so much. What if the corners are terrible? Then what does the LB do? Play Safety at the same time? COME on now. THINK!!!!"<br>  <br>  I'm assuming that was directed towards me? My point is that a great middle linebacker is the centerpiece of a great defense, and if you are a great linebacker, a great defense will follow.... how many great LB's were there that played on crummy defenses?  Again - look at Ray Lewis's career. His rookie season, the Ravens were DEAD LAST in the NFL in defensive yards, and close to that in points allowed. Many people forget this, but they were a strong offensive team, and a horrific defensive.<br>  <br>  However, it took only 3 years for Lewis to lead the team into being one of the top defenses year in and year out, with the exception of when Lewis was injured. Of course by that point, Lewis had some help (McAlister was a rookie, Boulware, Sharper, etc), but people always seem to forget that there has been a revolving door of talent around Lewis, and he's been consistently good.... as has the defense! When's the last time a LB left Baltimore via free agency and has been very successful?  Thomas has been okay, but far from a success in NE.... <br>  <br>  Now, Willis has been doing a great job in San Fran, and definitely makes a strong case for being the best in the league, but there's much more to playing football than racking up tackles. As I said, I think he could be one of the great ones, but he still has a lot of room to grow. I really think he will thrive with Singletary's guidance, but only time will tell. He's well on his way.<br>  <br>  Other guys who could develop to be great include Beason, Ruud, Bradley, Mayo, Ryans<br>  <br>  Willis has the jump on all of them, except for perhaps Beason, but Ruud and Bradley have gotten better each year, and Mayo should continue improving as well.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	At MLB? No. Willis is the best MLB in the game today. However, OLB is a different story. Guys like DeMarcus Ware and James Harrison could take the title as the best "overall" LB. <br>  <br>  You don't give the 49ers defense enough credit... they are not even close to as bad as you make them sound. Sure they have been shaky, but that is due to the inconsistencies of Nolan's hybrid defense. Once Singletary took over and implemented a solid 3-4 structure, the defense rose up the charts. Finishing the season in the top 15 run defense, and improving all around. They have plenty of talent. <br>  <br>  The Lions defense is not the 49ers defense... and if you put a guy like James Harrison on the 49ers defense... yes, he would be good. Though I do agree that Harrison's stats are slightly inflated due to the Steelers defense.<br>  <br>  ***To other answerers... are you seriously suggesting that if given the option you would take the likes of Jerrod Mayo and an aged Brian Urlacher over Patrick Willis? Wow!<br>  <br>  ***One Brave Mouse... I can see that you're not a talent scout for any body.

APnVzUUFaa	Definitely do NOT do this.<br>  <br>  Both fixed and single speed bikes aren't dramatically cheaper than geared bikes, so the loss of functionality isn't worth it.<br>  <br>  You are riding the bike to take a break from running, so you need to be able to ride easy and in a small gear. Unless your roads are flat as a pancake, you will have to work extra hard in a big gear up the hills with a fixed gear - exactly the opposite of the reason you are on the bike.<br>  <br>  The main purpose of your time on the bike should be active recovery and a change of pace mentally from running, not getting a "total leg workout". Save that for your running days. If you are doing the easy bike rides properly, you should be fresher on the days you want to run hard and will be able to get more improvement out of those workouts.<br>  <br>  If you have a normal geared bike and do want to do a hard workout on the bike, all you need to do is put it in a big gear and go hard, a fixed gear wont give you a better workout.<br>  <br>  It has been a common part of bicycle lore that using a fixed gear improves one's spin ( smooth pedal stroke ) on a normal geared bike, but this is very debatable.   I actually think it hinders it slightly, JMHO, because instead of the motion getting into "muscle memory", momentum forces the foot through the circle artificially. It's fine and necessary if you are a track cyclist, but not very useful for a road cyclist and even less for a runner.|`|1jPiAkP4aa	mtlbiker is right on the money. Fixed gears are not for novice cyclists, and really are only good 'cross' training for competitive cycists. Even then there are coaches who strongly advise against fixed gears unless you're training for track racing. I train a lot on fixed gear bikes and do a little track racing now and then (I suck at it). <br>  <br>  Really, the reason they are attempting to cajole you into a 'fixie' is for style points. They're pretty much a fad these days, and there are a number of manufacturers making fixed gear/single speed frames and complete bikes. <br>  <br>  If you want to look at it as a mode of transportation, a single speed is nice for its simplicity, but I wouldn't use it as 'cross training' for exactly why mtlbiker states, you'll wipe out your knees on a hill. <br>  <br>  A fixed gear also requires some finesse and technique that you don't have yet. You have to remember, on a fixed gear, you _cannot_ stop pedaling. One of my first times out I was spinning along nicely, rolled up to a stop sign, and attempted to stop quickly, the group was highly entertained - you had to be there, even I think it was hilarious now.<br>  <br>  Also, as a novice, do _not_ let anyone talk you into a fixed gear without brakes. They'll tell you that you can stop by using your legs, wrong..... as a novice, you'll need both front and rear. If you're riding around in the city on a fixed, there's no way you'll be able to stop quickly enough for a car pulling out in front of you just using your legs, and that's a sure way to severely pull a muscle or even tear a ligament depending on where your legs are when you try to stop. Riding without brakes in the city is just plain stupid in my book.<br>  <br>  You don't need to spend alot of money. One thing you can do is buy a used low-end road bike and convert it. All it takes is removing the derailleurs and shifter cables, replacing the rear wheel with a single speed freewheel, and possibly adding a chain tensioner if the bike has vertical dropouts. You can do most of this yourself, though you might want some help if the bike has integrated shifter/brake levers.<br>  <br>  After a while, you might want to try riding fixed, but I would get used to the single speed first. In that case, all you need to do is unscrew  the freewheel and screw on a fixed cog in its place, but remember, don't play in traffic.|`|4xnbDihJaa	I ride a fixed gear bike for many of these reasons.  Although I don't really like being part of the trend or labeled as a hipster.<br>  1. The bike was cheap, much cheaper than my road bike.  I use it as a winter beater that I don't have to worry about leaving outside.  I also suggest buying it used, or getting a converted frame (one that was not necessarily made to be a fixed gear, but can function perfectly as one.  These frames are plentiful and cheap). <br>  2. They are super easy to maintain.  If you can change a tire you are pretty much set.  There are very few moving parts, other than one brake cable (and make sure you do get a brake).<br>  3. I commute 20 miles a day on mine, it is fine.  However, if you live somewhere hilly or where you are going to be stopping and starting a lot, it is not so great (no low gears to pedal at low speeds).<br>  4. A lot of the benefit is for cyclists to ride, as having the fixed gear means you cannot stop pedaling at any time, so your cadence gets more steady.  Because of this it is good for anyone, when your legs don't stop you don't get any breaks.|`|NUKWB93naa	On your list of reasons to purchase a fixed gear #1 and #2 definitely apply. #3 does as well but it's not as definite. As for #4, I'm not so sure. I think the best training for a runner is to run. Riding a bike (any kind) might be a good way for you to get some active recovery but it won't make you a better runner. Running and cycling use the legs in very different ways.<br>  <br>  If you still want a bike I would opt for single speed and not fixed gear. There is a whole culture built up around fixies and their "outsider" attitude. If you are approaching from a more practical view, single speed has the advantages you mention without the down side of no brakes, new riding skills needed, etc. Also many single speed bikes come with what is called a flip-flop hub. You can turn the back wheel around and go from a single speed cog (that lets you coast) to a fixed gear one where the hub is locked. These kinds of bikes show up on eBay and Craigslist all the time.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	If you haven't been on a bike for a long time, a fixed gear bike may not be a good choice, unless you are riding exclusively on flat roads. When you begin training on a road bike, the idea is to not overstress your legs until you have built up some mileage. It is easy for a beginner to hurt their knees by pushing to hard a gear before they are ready, which can happen climbing hills on a fixed gear bike. The idea that you will adapt faster than someone who rides a bike with gears is wrong, an experienced cyclist will be used to spinning the pedals, and would adapt much faster than a non cyclist. A bike with gears would allow you to train on hills that you would probably not even be able to climb on a fixed gear bike allowing for a much more rounded training. Fixed gear bikes are less expensive and lower maintenance, but they are much less versatile than bikes with gears. A fixed gear is nice for those who ride in specific conditions, are already in good shape for cycling, and perhaps can afford more than 1 bike.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	A multi-gear bike will be much better for training.  A fixed gear bike is only good for a small range of speeds. You want to be able to increase the workout as you progress by climbing steeper hills and going faster.   A single speed will greatly limit your workout choices.  A fixed gear bike is for experience cyclists not someone who hasn't ridden for a while.<br>  <br>  If your running friends say the a fixed gear bike is better for cross training ask if you can try their bike out to see.  Chances are they don't own one.

People might take you more seriously if you used correct grammar and learned how to spell. It shows that you're not regurgitating something you heard some sports talk show jockey rant about, and that you've taken time to check into these things. That said, I'll assume that you have some intelligence to think about new ideas, so here's a different way of looking at it. <br>  <br>  Consistency. Favre might not have had the standout seasons that Peyton, Brady and Marino have always had, but he consistently performed at a level better than nearly any other QB in the game. The ability to stay in the game as long as he has, and perform at his level speaks volumes for his ability. Unlike some quarterbacks, he didn't shine for 4 years, then disappear. He's done this his entire career, racking up yards, touchdowns, and most importantly, victories. He put his team in the playoffs just about every year. When they were bad, he carried them on his back. When they were good, he pushed them to the next level. He got his ring. The Hall of Fame is more than just stats, it takes into account impact. And he impacted the game in a way few other QBs have. Remember this, ever since Lombardi retired, Green Bay has been nothing but a joke. Then along comes Favre, and puts them back on the map. He made the Packers into contenders once again. And that deserves the Hall.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	First of all, Favre had 9,280 career passing attempts... Marino, 8,358. That's not even 1,000 more passing attempts, let alone 1,300. <br>  <br>  Second, Favre (61.6) had a better career completion percentage than Dan Marino (59.4), so regardless of whether or not they had equal attempts, Favre still would've had more completions... there's one record justified. <br>  <br>  Third, Favre averaged 1 TD pass per 20 pass attempts. Marino averaged 1 TD per 19.9, pass attempts... a very marginal advantage, but an advantage none-the-less... so once again, regardless of pass attempts, Favre still would've beat Marino... there's 2 records justified. <br>  <br>  Fourth, it's a bit hypocritical of you to discredit all of Favre's "good" records because of his start streak, yet continue to bash him for his interception record, which is as much a "counting" stat (as you call them) as any. <br>  <br>  Finally, trying to take away Favre's accomplishments because he was tough enough to play through nagging injuries is like trying to take away Michael Jordons records because he was a "good shooter". Toughness is a huge attribute in football, people who are tough, are going to break more records than pansies who can't play through a dislocated pinky. <br>  <br>  Looks like you need to do a little more research, champ!<br>  <br>  ***FYI*** Favre has played 18 seasons... 1 more than Dan Marino's 17.<br>  <br>  ***Response to Metal Head*** after his 14th season, Favre had 226 interceptions... which was 26 less than Dan Marino's 252... I'm going to have to disagree with your judgement.<br>  <br>  LOL... you say things like, "...He was never the greatest over a 4 year term..." and "...he never carried a team...", yet you call MY "ignorance" into question and tell me that I "need to watch more games"... I'm sorry, where were you from 1995-1998 when Favre was busy wrapping up 3 straight NFL MVP's and back-to-back Superbowl appearences? Please tell me which QB was better over that 4 year span, and please, instead of just offering your, at this point worthless, opinion, why don't you back it up with some facts. Thanks.<br>  <br>  ...and just so you know... I am not a Favre fan. I'm not even a Packer fan. It's just a simple fact that he is one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history, and fools who fail to do proper research and find it necessary to bash the guy with no supporting facts, are becoming an annoyance.|`|zFNOaDAYaa	I agree that maybe he should win some kind of 'Iron Man' award or something. But that shouldn't qualify you for the HOF. I disagree with you that he never carried a team. He has carried his team to many wins solely off his ability.He has had some amazing moments. Also some pretty embarassing moments.He's definitely 'GOOD' but I agree with the 'padded stats' . GOOD QUESTION|`|6440aca54e76133287a99d198c3d1a37aa	Are you insane??  He has consistently been a quality quarterback for many years, almost all of them in an environment that is not friendly for QBs.  Most teams need to develop 3 or 4 QBs in the time that he played in GB.|`|kXPmr9oDaa	i definitly agree with you. if brady or manning stay that long, they would crush his records. except brady wouldnt throw that many interceptions haha|`|PMluTf72aa	If he's not that good, then he wouldn't have had a long career.  I will agree he's done though.<br>  <br>  P.S- you were owned by Cisco Kid   : )|`|jLOCqhckaa	Cisco kid deserves the best answer. You Pawned!|`|5B6w8mxVaa	yea, but he did break alot of records.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	You have proven to be a retard! Favre broke Elway's wins record and Marino's records in less games than they did. <br>  <br>  Did Hank Aaron suck because it took him over 1,000 more games to break Ruth's record?<br>  <br>  In his 90's prime- Favre played QB at a level we have NEVER seen before or since! He was unbelievable!!!|`|gvMr9lMbaa	Who says he was the greatest of all time?He is a Hall Of Fame QB who won 3 straight MVP's and a Super Bowl(went to back to back).His teams were in the playoffs almost every year(1st year he was gone they went 6-10 after going to Conference title)<br>     You have to have a long career to be at the top of a stat category so that is irrelevant.His streak at hos position might never be matched,that is not a negative.<br>      Where u want to rank him is your choice but to say he isn't a all time great is very ignorant.|`|CQcLHR0zaa	agree 110% man<br>  <br>  hes only going on his what 20th season? <br>  <br>  guy needs to call it quits and ppl need to not think hes good because he tops everybody else by 10 yrs|`|RPLZNFzAaa	Yea it is about time for him to call it quits|`|cdMKgBuXaa	Brady is a product of being at the right place at the right time. Example cassell looked pretty good for an average QB. Marino had all the records because he never had a running game forcing him to throw all the time. Marino was a great QB who rarely forced a bad throw but his completion percetage was bad only cause he throw every down giving defenses a chance to adjust to his timing. Brett is great yeah int's are league best now, he always tried making something out of nothing. Brett is a top10 QB of all time, time will tell if anyone other the payton manning will touch his records. Marino, Montana, Johnny U, Fran T, Brett, Elway, Payton, on and on|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	I would have to disagree only because he would've still gotten the INT record had he only played 14 years.|`|KNTofuxMaa	I think you were just schooled by the Cisco Kid. I've never been a Packer fan but, I'm sick of all these kiddies bashing on Favre. The guy hasn't done himself any favors with the last couple of years worth of drama but, he is still a great HoF QB.
Vyz5YnZqaa	Those look like Eli Manning numbers and everyone thinks he should be made a probowler this year when he ranked 16th out of 32 QBs. It's funny how a QB will get all the credit weather it's good or bad, like Romo getting blamed for all the Dallas loses.|`|KNTofuxMaa	I think it's hilarious when 16 year old kids try to determine stuff that happened years before their time. Did you ever see him play, Junior? You Tube doesn't count.<br>  <br>  Joe Namath is in the Professional Football Hall of Fame. While his career statistics are not exceptional, Namath was the game's first true media superstar and Namath was the first NFL quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards during the 14 game 1967 season. This feat was not to be achieved again until Dan Fouts topped 4,000 yards during the 1979 season in a 16 game season. Namath threw for 4,000 yards under old rules that gave much less protection to both the quarterback and receivers. Namath's play on the field in the years before his knees seriously limited his mobility helped evolve the quarterback position and the NFL style of play from a run oriented ball control game to today's more open passing style. Perhaps the accolades of experts say it best. Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh stated that Namath was "the most beautiful, accurate, stylish passer with the quickest release I've ever seen." Hall of Fame coach Don Shula stated that Namath was "one of the 3 smartest quarterbacks of all time"|`|VTN4Qun9aa	I think people hear he guaranteed a win and then delivered in Super Bowl 3, and then they just assume that he must have been a great QB, because, for the most part, only a great QB would say something that cocky.|`|lVGHhDn1aa	First quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards in a season.<br>  <br>  And talk about swag... rappers wish they had swag like Broadway Joe<br>  <br>  Also his knees were mush by the time he got out of Alabama, so he was basically playing at 60% his entire career|`|7Vka1VcOaa	He wins one Super Bowl in an otherwise so-so career and he's mentioned in the same breath as q.b.'s that are head and shoulders above him. I don't get it either.|`|2VGbJtnCaa	I agree with you 100%! He may be the most overrated QB in NFL history. And he is in the HOF because of a guarennte.|`|Gku81sSXaa	You have to put it in the context of the times.  Yes I do think Joe Namath was overrated but his statistics aren't that bad if you compare it to other quarterbacks at the time.  The rules were different then which made passing much harder than it is today.  Also Namath played most of his career at Shea Stadium in Flushing, New York where the winds generally were very strong and swirling which made passing very hard.<br>  <br>  The Jets usually had very bad personnel which obviously did not help his passing.<br>  <br>  <br>  He had the all time season record for most yardage in a season at one point with over 4000 yards.  This was done over 14 games.  The yardage amount would be impressive even today and that would be in a 16 game season.<br>  <br>  I don't want to make it seem that he was perfect because frankly the guys, while he had a super arm and a great quick release made some of the stupidest decisions I've ever seen.  He had a lot of interceptions because, like Brett Favre of recent years, he forced the ball into double or triple coverage because he had so much faith in his strong arm to get it in there.  A lot of Namath's bad seasons came late in his career which made his career stats look bad.<br>  <br>  I don't think he was a great quarterback and if he was not in the Hall of Fame I don't think it would be a big deal.  <br>  <br>  The main reason was his Super Bowl, which many think was the most important football game in history.  <br>  <br>  Put it this way, in the late 1960's, if you asked any team that they could trade their QB for Joe Namath, I think perhaps all of them would have said yes.  He was a gifted super strong armed QB with arguably the fastest release in history.  Given the right personnel Namath could have broken a lot of records.|`|1IG4GdGqaa	The real question is where did you learn to spell. Oh and it started in superbowl 3 when he guaranteed a win and went out and won the game for the Jets. In case you haven't heard about that or anything.|`|PuxP6UzVaa	Joe Namath had a very strong arm with a quick release but he was a very slow runner because of all the knee injuries he had during his career.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	If he wasnt good he wouldnt be in the hall of fame.|`|a3yqkNMMaa	You're a moron.
wxXguyK3aa	My top five:<br>  Joe Montanna<br>  Brett Favre<br>  Tom Brady <br>  Peyton Manning<br>  Terry Bradshaw|`|KNTofuxMaa	Dude, seriously, would you let the guy finish his career, first? Jesus man, is Brady paying you to say this stuff? I haven't seen a man crush like this since Madden/Favre.|`|JH9IMMDtaa	my top 5 QB's are (not in any paticular order) Dan Marino, Peyton Manning, John Elway, Joe Montana, and Terry Bradshaw. he deserves to be in the top 5 when he stands the test of time. these players that I have mentioned (except for Peyton) have stood the test of time. I'm not saying he;s not a good player, I'm saying that he's not top 5 quality yet.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	I think "someone" needs to change their screen name to "bradysballsinmymouth"...|`|JTSNljLhaa	hes not that old and maybe bout time he finish his career he will go down as one of the greatest..|`|ndopqX6Taa	"If you don't see why Brady is the best you dumb"<br>  <br>  Couldn't get past this sentence and not get a good laugh from you calling other people dumb! Learn some proper grammar before insulting others.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It is not like you would listen to any arguement. Your big boy man crush is blinding your vision. No one should be considered top 5 in history when they haven't even played half their career yet.<br>  <br>  He has been a starter for 8 years, you don't think he could play another 8 years? I think he could if he wants to. Especially if he is a top 5 QB of all time like you think he is. Many QB's play into their 40's.|`|1IG4GdGqaa	It's obvious your man crush on Brady is a personal problem. However I rank him as one of the best QBs of this generation or of his time. However of all time? Let's see how he finishes his career first, then come back and ask this question again. I mean c'mon, Montana, Plunket, Marino, Favre, Young, P. Manning, Starr, Unitas. there are a lot of amazing QBs throughout NFL history. Brady is definitely one of them, but maybe not in the top five just yet.|`|9NVwFNjOaa	Me<br>  <br>  1.Montana 8.Brady<br>  2.Marino<br>  3.Young<br>  4.Namath<br>  5.Elway<br>  6.Farve<br>  7.Manning|`|KdcansIyaa	I didn't know AL Davis was on here asking questions. I guess you learn something new everyday<br>  <br>  Look how about you get off TOM BRADY'S stuff and come back to reality.<br>  <br>  Best of all time? Not even close<br>  <br>  He first off has a insane receiving core. RANDY MOSS, WES WELKER, JABAR GAFFNEY. Come on. Maroney?<br>  <br>  <br>  You think he is better than DAN MARINO??? Steve Young, Joe Montana, John Elway, Roger Staubach, Kenny Anderson, Brett Farve, Peyton Manning, Bart Starr.<br>  <br>  You just like Tom Brady because the press blew him up so fast its not even funny. He has 3 rings which is great. Does that mean Ben R. is a great qb? top 5? He has 2 rings and only 25. Brady is almosy 32.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	I can't believe any WOULD put him in the top 5!<br>  <br>  He might rank in the top 25- maybe! Dude has only had 5-6 good years.<br>  <br>  No way he ranks above<br>  Baugh<br>  Graham<br>  Waterfield<br>  Layne<br>  Unitas<br>  Staubach<br>  Montana<br>  Elway<br>  Favre<br>  Manning<br>  or even Marino<br>  He might be working his way to be about equal to a Steve Young or Jim Kelly

The new manager would only have the previous team to work with. He would not be able to bring his own team.<br>  I believe Rafa should go. He has not done anything that the previous managers tried. Liverpool finished second, third, fourth, won a FA Cup and a CL. Liverpool are a big club. Even with a novice young manager, Liverpool will be where they are now. <br>  A good manager is someone who can take a club to the next level. Martin O'Neil is a good manager. He took a good Villa side to the next level fighting for CL spots. Even Sir Alex took a fading Man United side in the 80s and took them to the next level. <br>  Rafa has not done anything to impress me. He should go. But at the end of the season. Let him finish his crap this season.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	He'll be there for a while, he'll sign a new contract in the summer.|`|e6TD1j1gaa	I think that if they were going to sack Benitez, they would have already done it.

IZCeOSpJaa	The Slazenger irons are serviceable. If you are a high handicapper on a tight budget they'll do, but don't expect miracles from them.

I don't watch SD so I can't talk about that show, but it was getting tiresome seeing CM Punk v. King of the Ring. I was able to predict the matches and outcomes so adding in the SD talent really makes things fresh and exciting. I like HHH and Orton so I love having them on the same show. I wish the WWE would hire more wrestlers. Like Beth Phoenix having to constantly fight Melina b/c they are the only female wrestlers is really sad. Also, the only cool tag team is with the Miz and Morrison. The others don't receive as much play. So it's cool to have the mix-up. I hope it continues, except for the Y2J storyline. He's my favorite wrestler so having him taunt old wrestlers instead of going after the belt seems odd. Like he was motivated to go after Cena and get his belt back and then The Wrestler came out and Mickey Rourke made those comments and the storyline completely flipped. Oh well.|`|4b55d51771ea5c3ad51e0b50a0ae77deaa	I really like the new storylines because it changed everything up a little. <br>  <br>  I was getting bored of seeing the same people compete every week but now you never know who you could see appearing on RAW.<br>  <br>  BQ- To me Shawn michaels is Mr. Wrestlemania.

He gives it his all just for us.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	I understand where you are coming from. maybe this year they wont have a brand supremacy match. if they do however it wont involve jericho because it seems to me that he will be fighting one of the legends at wrestlemania. if kozlov loses to shawn michaels next week it could be kozlov against kane. kane really doesnt have much of a storyline going right now and i cant seem them leaving both kane and kozlov out of wrestlemania.

Why did you took a three pointer instead of two? Can you elaborate what really had happened in the game before that play? Basketball is a team game and it's not you fault if your team lose, it's a good judgement on your side. Your coach is such an *ss to put the blame on you, 'coz in the first place, your team wouldn't be in that situation if he is that good. Just don't mind them, don't be sorry, you did what you have to do. Maybe that game was not for you guys anyway...|`|tefmLFmWaa	A rookie-sophomore mistake but that's a lesson learned.

If you're male, you might have a chance, since male gymnastics relies more on strength so male gymnasts tend to be older; but you'll have 10 years of catchup to those who started early, which is very difficult to overcome.  If you're female, then it's pretty unlikely; female gymnasts usually are pros in that period in their teens when the extreme demands of their pro-level sport has delayed advanced puberty, so that they're old enough to compete, but not yet developed enough to throw off their performance and put them at a disadvantage compared to the less-developed girls.<br>  <br>  If you simply love gymnastics and want to enjoy the sport, it's never too late to start (well, unless you're old enough to break a hip trying to do a split).|`|n7BuH75gaa	I don't think it's late at all.<br>  <br>  You have a lot of hard work ahead of you though!<br>  Have fun!!!|`|7BHIyMFmaa	Too late to be a professional gymnast, too late to get a scholarship to a college. but not too late if you just want to have fun.
f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	A clear and contrasting background to observe the bowler's action and pick up the ball early.<br>  Any movement near the sightscreen(if it is not wide enough) distracts the batsman. When right handers and lefters bat altternately they want them to be moved(also when bowler switches to either side of the wicket).|`|AA11088802	to clearly saw the ball while playing from the hand of bowler|`|xabjLTKqaa	sight screen helps the batsman to get a clear view of the ball. if there was no sight screen .the colour of the ball may mix with the background colour which makes it difficult for the batsman to spot the ball. that is the reason why no fielder is allowed to be placed before the sight screen.|`|GdJTQX6raa	to view the bowlers' arm and the delivery of ball they need a strong back ground, other wise a batsman will fail to read the delivery. they are not making fuss, it is very genuine.
L1QTSErIaa	The offside rule simply means a player should not be the last man before the ball is passed to him. But this does not apply if the ball was touched last by the opponent. <br>  This rule is important in football. It's implemented to encourage positive play. For instance, without this rule :<br>  The striker will simply stay near the opponents half and wait for the ball. And his team mates will simply kick the ball up to him. There would not be any midfield play. <br>  And because of this, the opponents defenders will have to stay behind to mark the striker. They would not have a chance to move up to help their team mates in attack. <br>  So can you imagine the game now. It would look more like tennis. <br>  This is the reason the 'offside' rule was implemented. It's one of the reason football is so entertaining.|`|agS1kmhLaa	It is no offense to be "offside". It is only called if the player is involved in active play bedhind the second to last defender. So if a player is just picking dandelions behind the second to last defender, there is no offense. But if the player jumps up and receives the ball while offside, it is called. Offside is behind the second to last defender, but not if they are behind the ball. If an offside player shoots a goal, it does not count. Hope that helps!|`|rQObX6uEaa	If you, the person with the ball, in the oppositions half, kicks to your forward, but that forward had no opposition players (except the goalie) between him and the goals at the time that the ball leaves your boot, he is off-side.

lnRMmSeyaa	well during competition we wear them so the judges dont have to see if our boots are all scratched and dirty, and if you wear them if makes your leg look longer then if you have your legs then theres a white boot, so for competing its prettymuch just for elegance<br>  <br>  and for practicing we wear them just so if we do any moves that we need to put our boot on the ice (ex. a lunge) it wont chip off the white paint or rot the wood as easily<br>  <br>  if your want to have clean pretty looking skates you should wear over the boot tights<br>  <br>  <br>  figure skater of 6 years <3|`|WJ7BhjM2aa	During competition you are judged on how you look including the condition of your skates.  Scuffed up and torn leather on skates isn't pretty.  <br>  <br>  Many people wear over the boot tights so that it protects their skates from scuffs and cuts in the leather.  They also wear boot covers and over the boot tights to match their outfits because they just don't care for the white skates with their dress.|`|MjtmHraHaa	Boot covers and over-the-boot tights are used to protect skates from marks and scuffs.  Different colored boot covers are sometimes worn to dress up a costume too.  Skaters do use the over-the-boot tights to hide the condition of of the skater's boots and the tights, just like with beige colored boots, can elongate the look of the skater's legs, making them appear a little taller and have a longer "line.  Just like with anything else, skaters seem to go through "trends" with what they wear.  When I started competing, we had to polish our skates and anything other than regular tights were thought to be frowned upon by the judges.  Eventually, skaters started wearing Mondors, the ones that skaters typically wear just over the top of their boots and even the ones with stirrups, and it just became accepted.  More recently, the over-the-boot tights have become very popular for all the previously stated reasons.|`|akA3oJx6aa	It's not as much protection as it is looks. Judges care about your discretion on looks, and how much you care for you skates. You can't take it for granted.<br>  <br>  I wear boot cover tights and my skates are yellowing, have traces of permanent marker on them, and the wood is wearing. There are a bunch of scratches and there are holes in every pair of boot cover tights I own.|`|YjIZQ4oQaa	Boot covers are worn to protect the boots from cut sand scratches.  They are also used to dress up the hand down used boots. Even with them on, my daughter' boots still get cuts from jumps but the cuts are not as deep had she didn't have them on.
lnRMmSeyaa	ive heard the jacksons are made for people with wider feet, but if those still dont work you will have to get custom boots and they will measure your foot so the boot will be made specially for you, i had to get customs because my foot was sooo narrow and ive never gotton a blister or a cut from them or anything, i think mine costed about $3000 but that was for SP-Teris, jackson are probably only about $1000|`|akA3oJx6aa	As far as I know, Jackson offers skates with the wideness of A, B, and C, A being the narrowest, and C being the widest. I currently have a Jackson C, but it's a very form fitting boot, and I used to wear a B. However, mine are at a higher level, so they have a bunch of padding to accommodate my giant feet well, so the beginner ones should have wider ones for your foot.|`|AA12338333	Beginner skates do come in wide widths but be sure you are measured by a professional skate fitter in a pro shop.  They will be able to help you find the right pair of skates for your feet.<br>  <br>  The Jackson Classique does come in a 'C' width.  The Riedell 121 also comes in a wide width.  Those are both good skates to look for and are in the $125-$130 USD range.|`|KgrlT6Z6aa	yeah!  i've had jacksons in C's and D's, reidell's in c's and d's, and I now own SP-Terri's in C heels, D ball.|`|5bl8pKkGaa	Try jacksons, and if your just starting out, and want to keep it up I recommend the Classiques their very comfy, and shouldn't take long to break in. <br>  I'd go to a shop and try some on though because sizes can differ.<br>  Good Luck

gJ3Y1Kycaa	i do ITF taekwondo and the sparring part is very similar to kick boxing we have punches, kicks, knees, elbows. but taekwondo also incorporates joint locking techniques, throws and take downs and gun and knife disarming techniques. alot of ITF tkd guys do very well in kickboxing competitions. tomaz barada was 6 times world WAKO kickboxing champion and he was a tkd practitioner. serkan yilmaz fights well in K1. zelg galesic uses tkd well in mma. cung le has a black belt in tkd so does bas rutten.<br>  <br>  it really depends what you want to do. if you just want to compete then i would choose kickboxing because you will spend all your time focusing on that. but if your looking for a more self defence art then go for tkd. but remember in tkd that you will also have to focus on the patterns and 3 step sparring alot aswell in order to get higher belts. WTF is the flashy oylimpic sport which i would avoid but ITF tkd is very effective and more straight to the point.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|AFkjkqcSaa	I have been doing full contact kickboxing for 14years.

jSkHquK5aa	One of the best ways to get good at dribbling is to play football with a tennis ball, or other smaller ball. You will get used to the constant adjustments needed and dribbling a full sized football will seem much easier.<br>  Use all the surfaces of your foot. Most often you will be using the front portion of your instep, especially when you are dribbling at speed. However, to become a good dribbler of the ball, make sure that you are adept at using the outside and inside of both feet. This way you can cut the ball away from pressure and keep control of the ball no matter where the defensive pressure comes from. You can also use both sides of your foot, like a hockey player's stick.<br>  Touch the ball with each step you take with the ball. In very quick succession, touch the ball a little bit ahead of you when you dribble. This will create both good control and increase your dribbling speed with the ball. With this kind of control you can elude defenders when they try to reach in and steal the ball, you can just cut the ball away since it is always so close to you. It is almost as if you are trying to get as many touches in as you dribble forward with the ball. Go slowly and exaggerate this at the beginning when you are practicing, to ensure you are getting a touch on the ball with each step.<br>  Change the pace. This is the key to going by a player on the dribble. You don't necessarily need to be extremely fast to beat someone on the dribble; rather, you need to lull the defender to sleep for a second and then break past the opponent with a burst of speed.<br>  Lift up your eyes. Subtly be aware of your surroundings as you still maintain focus on the ball while dribbling. Lift your eyes slightly so you know if someone is making a run, another defender is approaching, or there is space to attack.<br>  Improve your weak foot. The best advice is just to use it. If you continue to strike the ball against a wall with your bad foot, slowly but steadily you will see improvement. Have patience. However, there are always exceptions; if you look at one of the best players in the world Renaldo de Seta, he only uses his left foot, simply because his left foot is so incredibly powerful and he positions his body so well to protect the ball. He is a player who is so experienced and so skilled with his left foot, that he can get away with it.<br>  Use your body to protect the ball. Shield the ball with your body when a defender gets close. Try to keep the ball on the foot that is furthest from the defender and your body protects the ball.|`|D9QLM6sRaa	I didn't know how to do dribbling before but now i can do like 300 so you have to train yourself everyday and don't worry about mistakes keep training yourself :).<br>  <br>  Good Luck Buddy.|`|xegK7yhiaa	Play alot. Really, just practice. There is no other way. All the great football players that are in their position today got their through practicing.

HXILtO0Gaa	yo, most bmx riders these days either ride with just a back brake, and a single cable going to it.  you can still barspin it just beens after the barspin u gotta spin it back round after wards to un wind the cable.  But most street riders these days have no brakes, it keeps it simple and u can spin away all day, i would say no brakes are better, or get a gyro, gyro's are quite un common these days as bmxers like to keep things looking simple and low maintenance, gyros mean having lots off cables which can snap and it makes the bike look quite cluttery.|`|4KN0sTN5aa	buy a longer cable and then do all of them as the others have said it is simperler and with no brakes its a lot harder to control(and it destroys your shoes lol) just get a linear brake cable thats quite long|`|u5T1RbEOaa	If you want to do bar spins with brakes just use a longer brake cable so you can get away with it, try a Teflon coated one. Gyros are heavy and reduce braking power. The idea in BMX is to keep the bike as light as possible. Given now you can get light, efficient gyros, they cost a lot of money that could be better spent on rims or cranks. Brakeless is another option that most of the real good riders go with, it's ultimately the lightest option but dangerous and depending on where you ride, it could be illegal. Those are the big options but ultimately it comes down to personal preference and style.

L7x1yKHiaa	I own all 3 boards and like what some of the guys says it depends on what you're looking for.  Here's a quick breakdown IMO:<br>  <br>  Vapor - Feels incredibly light like you're riding on a piece of plastic rather than wood.  Terrific for pipe and carves great S's.  Very nice base and can go FAST!  2009 version also has ICS.  Downside for me is it doesn't hold edge on ice as well.  <br>  <br>  Banana - Soft reversed camber board.  Not as stable as the Vapor on fast groomers but better on powder and moguls.  Fun board to do tricks and ride powder with.  MTX also provides good grip on ice.  <br>  <br>  TRS BTX - Very similar to the Banana but it's a directional Twin and a noticeably stiffer.  You can go faster and get bigger air but it's probably not as fun to play around and jib or do trix with.|`|m8Qqbfnzaa	first of all, i would NEVER suggest burton boards to anyone, their bindings and boots are more than legit, but thier decks are pretty awful (ive broke few too many). <br>  <br>  as for the Lib Tech Skate Banana, i wouldn't, nay, could'nt say no to that. it is the board that changed snowboarding. the reverse chamber was the next step in snowboard evolution.  it provides a good feel on everything from rails to trails. most park boards aren't good on the trails, this board is great on both. most jib boards aren't good in the pipe, this board is. i have the K2 WWW, and even that is based off of the Skate Banana.<br>  <br>  in short, ROCK OUT WITH ThE ROCKER, go with the banana kid|`|b384db6ad40e335e34a6b836f0c3ea3baa	The common misconception about the banana is that it is only for the park. This board rips all over from pow to the park. I've never heard a bad thing about it. The only knock on it is that it isn't the most stable board for landing 60 foot plus jumps. Get the banana. It's the future of snowboarding.|`|LIKkt8djaa	Apples and oranges my friend... The only board burton has right now that I know of similar to the Skate banana would be the Burton hero.|`|CqB5ryTFaa	Lib-tech banana is a sick bored i almost bought but instead i got a ROME Agent all the company's are coming out with awesome products now I would go to your local board shop and ask someone who works there that knows there stuff and they can usually explain all the smallest details of each board so you can decide which board would suit your style of riding best.|`|HVpeJzM4aa	the burton reviews were done by noobs...anybody that's anybody that has actual snowboarding knowledge knows that they're over priced and their quality is subpar. <br>  <br>  Like everyone says...you're pretty much asking what's better, a ford mustang, or a harley davidson...<br>  <br>  If you want a really good board get the k2 zeppelin or podium..those boards got way better reviews than burton, and they're one of the best boards on the market and they're all terrain.|`|svEdo4FBaa	The Vapor is for a completely different purpose than the skate banana.  You're asking people to compare apples and oranges.  The answer is, whichever board fits what you want to do, is better.|`|t9wmXEMAaa	Bro, there both WAY different boards.

fPRk469paa	The martial art being used is Pekiti-Tirsia Kali the same art used in the Hunted and the Bourne movies.  The reason it looks different is because in the two movies I mentioned, most of the moves are actually just flow drills used to learn different angles of attack, increase speed and fluidity.  And they use it in that context  to make the fights last a long time for dramatic effect. The way you see it in Taken is how it is really used, one or two simple vicious moves and the opponent is down and out if not dead.  Kali and Silat are two of just a handfull of martial arts that have never been watered down for sport.  Imagine being on the beach fighting with your tribe  against multiple armed opponents you only have one or two seconds to take someone out before you are attacked by another enemy  That is exactly how both of these arts originated.  Breaking arms, legs, ripping out eyes and throat, hair pulling, skin ripping, slicing through their tendons and veins, they have no other purpose than destroying the enemy as fast and brutal as possible.  That is why you don't see any of it in the cage fights because all most all of the moves are illegal in sport competitions.  It is also very hard to find quality instructors who really know what they are doing.  If interested in learning go to pt-go.com and look for instructors around the world and if you have to watch for seminars held in your state.  I promise you once you start and see how all the moves work either empty handed, or with any thing you can put in your hand you will be hooked for life.  If you are searching for Kali be ready to hear it called by escrima or arnis along with several style names of kali.  All most people do is study the older systems like Pekiti and then just number their strikes different and call it some new family system that is sopposed to have existed for hundreds of years.  Its really just a marketing scam to make money,  their hasn't been any new systems developed for hundreds of years Bruce Lee even admitted it when he said he didn't create anything new.  He just found things that worked for him and then made the moves as effecient as possible.  He also said people only have two arms and two legs so until their are humans on earth who are built differently their will only be one true way to fight.    Most people will say Im crazy but there is just a handfull of Masters who will tell some of their students the truth in private but not in public.That all martial arts are the same you can find the same moves in just about every style they just concentrate on certain moves over others to be different.  Look at the difference between Muay Thai and its mother art Krabi Krabong. Sorry to be so long winded but alot of people are scammed everday by schools.  Good Luck with your training.|`|9b5QUw2eaa	Looks like Kung Fu, Okinawan Karate or, Japanese Ju Jitsu, or one of the military styles like Krav Maga or Systema with lots of upper body techniques, surgical strikes, and stand up grappling.    Outside of the gym or ring, like Bruce Lee said, "there is no style".  You just use what works.      As cool as the old "Best of the Best" movies were, using a sport style to fight groups of people and armed people might be less realistic for someone who wasn't an athlete.|`|73wpIlgnaa	I agree with the guy above me.

oNR7il8baa	I actually agree. Kun's level has gone down... I don't know if it's because of fame or because he has had injures keeping him constantly off. However, If fame had gotten to his head I do think he would have left Atléti by now. <br>  <br>  If he leaves then good luck to him and I hope he does well. I guess... Whatever, if he'd go to Real he can go and suck some bench lol =\|`|7Xridrxaaa	I am sorry but i think the fame got to the boy's head and he isnt that good anymore. I mean he has potential and he is still young but i just dont see him doing anything special. I feel sorry for him cause he is going to live in the shadows of Messi for a long time. Back in Independiente he was tearing apart every single team and he just had that passion you love to see from any soccer player. I still remember seeing him cry when he got a red card in the second to the last game that wouldnt make him eligibile for the last game before leaving to Atletico. That game he would miss would be at home to title contending Boca Jrs in the last round of play and i just saw something special in that kid when he went out in tears and chanted songs with La Roja fans..... now marrying Maradona's daugther shows how fake he has turned to haha but i doubt he is leaving since Atletico prize him real high|`|8zgFyfibaa	Sergio aguero doesn't play like he used to the fame got to him.

Still it seems a reasonable compromise. <br>  <br>  Data sample<br>  Regular Seasons: '03-04, '04-05, '05-06, '06-07, '07-08, '08-09 (thru 2/4)<br>  Playoffs: '03-04, '04-05, '05-06, '06-07, '07-08 <br>  <br>  So we're looking at five full regular and playoff seasons, with additionally the current 08-09 season so far. <br>  <br>  The first thing to note is that these types of shots are very difficult on a league wide basis: a .298 Field Goal percentage doesn't exactly inspire confidence! <br>  Part of this is that game winning chances may come with just a couple of seconds or less remaining in the game from the inbounds. So manufacturing any shot at all in some cases is to the player's credit. In some cases it can even be a half court heave! <br>  <br>  <br>  LeBron James was just 4-19 in our previous look at game winning shots, so in the ensuing two and a half seasons, he has come up with a very respectable 13-31 (.419) record and just the other day had a pure game winner at the buzzer to top the Warriors. In addition he has six assists and a healthy number of free throws earned. <br>  <br>  Vince Carter doesn't get a lot of love from fans for the most part but is actually #2 in the standings for most game winners over this period. <br>  <br>  Ray Allen is in third overall but also leads in most 3's made under our game winning defined situation specifics, with eight three pointers. Long live the NBA's arguably best pure shooter (Ray also currently leads the NBA in Midrange 2pt FG%). <br>  <br>  ...and then we get to Kobe Bryant. Kobe fans don't like to hear it, but while their man is #4 in the league in total game winners hit, he holds the top spot in a less glamorous category: most game winning opportunity missed shots! <br>  <br>  42 - Kobe<br>  35 - Vince Carter<br>  33 - Joe Johnson, LeBron<br>  32 - Crawford<br>  31 - Billups <br>  <br>  Now we're not Kobe haters by any means and I will readily give him his due as one of the best NBA players (note however, I didn't say the best) but he certainly has an overblown reputation when it comes to the clutch shot: people remember the ones he hits, but not the ones he misses, and heck you think a 56 FGA to 1 assist ratio might be part of the problem? He does have a better record in the playoffs though, which we'll get to down below. <br>  <br>  Carmelo Anthony has slipped from the former top spot, but still a worthy challenger with the best fg% of any player with at least 10 makes. <br>  <br>  Beyond that, you see a lot of familiar names, most with low success rates, and a lot of players with very low assists. <br>  <br>  Paul Pierce is an exception as he stands at the head of the class for 'game winning assists' with nine, ahead of Nash, Kidd, Billups, and the rest. <br>  <br>  Oy! you say, what about the up and comers who may not have been playing all that long? Obviously Chris Paul (8-21), Igoudala (8-22), and Bradon Roy (7-19) are climbing the charts rapidly. Let's do a quick tab of the season by season leaders (fgm-fga): <br>  <br>  '03-04<br>  Stoudamire 5-9<br>  J.Rose 4-4<br>  Yao 4-7<br>  Carter 4-11<br>  R.Allen 3-5<br>  Z.Randolph 3-5<br>  Redd 3-8 <br>  <br>  '04-05<br>  Iverson 5-7<br>  Francis 5-8<br>  P.J. Brown (!) 4-6<br>  B.Gordon 4-7<br>  Da.Jones 4-7<br>  Pierce 4-9<br>  Wade 4-11 <br>  <br>  '05-06<br>  Carmelo 7-10<br>  Gasol 6-9<br>  R.Allen 5-11<br>  J.Johnson 5-16<br>  Fisher 4-6<br>  Crawford 4-8<br>  Webber 4-9<br>  <br>  '06-07<br>  R.Lewis 5-7<br>  B.Gordon 5-14<br>  R.Davis 4-8<br>  Carter 4-9<br>  Paul 4-9 <br>  <br>  '07-08<br>  LeBron 6-14<br>  T.Outlaw 5-5<br>  Ginobili 3-4<br>  R.Allen 3-7<br>  <br>  '08-09<br>  Granger 5-7<br>  Roy 4-7<br>  R.Mason 3-3<br>  Durant 3-8<br>  Felton 3-8 <br>  <br>  Now let's turn back to giving Kobe fans the ammunition they need to continue telling us how Mr. Bryant is the most uber-clutch guy in the NBA...with a look at Playoff Game Winning Shots <br>  <br>  Kobe Bryant 4-8<br>   LeBron James 4-8<br>   Dirk Nowitzki 3-6<br>   Dwyane Wade 2-2<br>   Caron Butler 2-3  <br>   Gilbert Arenas 2-5<br>   Tim Duncan 2-6 <br>   Manu Ginobili 2-6  <br>   Chauncey Billups 2-9  <br>  <br>  So now you have select company with only eight players, all of them all stars, with at least two makes. And yes, Kobe Bryant is indeed tied for first and with an excellent .500 percentage as well. <br>  <br>  The truth seems to be that while we want to believe in the infallible hero who comes through every time, in the NBA even the brightest of the bunch are lucky to come through one out of three times. <br>  <br>  Ultimately though while this kind of thing is fun, it's

JD5NQxeNaa	I do not think he will leave, but if he does I would resign West, Varejao, and Big Z quick to keep the foundation. Then let Pavlovic, Sczcerbiak, Gibson's and Snow's expiring contracts come off the books and unfortunately if LBJ23 leaves, which I do not think would happen I would offer a contract to Rudy Gay - he is super athletic and good and plays in Memphis they have no fan base and generate very little $, so he would likely go to the $. Then offer Caron Butler a contract and make him the face of the franchise.    The Cavs would still be a playoff team and would compete while still being in rebuilding mode. Then they could just play future free agency and the draft game and get quality players that would keep them set and establish themselves once more as contenders.    PG. MO WILLIAMS  SG. RUDY GAY  SF. CARON BUTLER  PF. BEN WALLACE  C. ZYDRUNAS ILGUASKAS  6. Delonte West  7. Anderson Varejao|`|Mn97YDIyaa	The only thing they could really do is to try to get somebody else from that big free agent pool, like D-Wade or Chris Bosh. Otherwise, their season is pretty much done unless they can trade for a superstar.|`|dcNT65mTaa	Well in the event he does leave, the Cavs should be able to sort of swap him out with another major star.

Murray is a close second, but a few VERY important things separate them.  Winning a slam is a MASSIVE barrier, until Murray does that no matter how many times he can beat the top 3 players and even possibly rise up the rankings more, winning a slam changes everything and puts you on a totally different level than people that is why Roger was confused on why Murray was the favorite at the Aussie Open.  Now admittedly that would mean that people like Safin or Moya would be on a different level, but this is where the rankings are obviously there too where Novak is higher there as well.  Like Novak said "Look at my ranking and look at his" although Murray has played great tennis ever since Wimbledon, it has only been for like 7 months, in order to get higher he will have to do this more than 7 months of the year.  Although it may sound a bit biased coming from a Novak fan, there is no doubt that Novak is the best tennis player besides Federer and Nadal from any real point of view, he has had the ability to stay with these two for the past year and half rather than just 7 months so far.|`|RQBolYlXaa	marat safin :)|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	murray|`|f05463dc082c3c7c8280c54e35eada93aa	Andy Murray!|`|iyDXt5d9aa	Besides my Rafa...hmmm....Djokovic is really good, but I'm gonna have to go with Safin...maybe haha it's hard to say!!|`|ezxKSt5xaa	I think Fernando Verdasco played a great game|`|uX09rPGlaa	Andy Murray|`|eY1Vttiyaa	Andy Murray no doubt about it.|`|75ZMWlnnaa	novak djokovic, if only he did not have all these health problems, he could have been a much better player than he is now, he just has to retire at the US Open to achieve the 'Retirement Slam'- sorry that is really mean, but it is a fact.    i like his game, but all these retirements are not giving me a good impression of novak. at least he has won a grand slam though.    andy murray is getting up there, but he has to win a grand slam LOL, i was full laughing when they put murray as equal favourite with federer, and AHEAD of nadal and djokovic :S, like seriously, murray can beat the top 3 guys (rafa, roger, novak) as many times as he wants, but if he does not beat them in a major final, it will not matter to anyone, because the majors are the BIG stage.    so far, murray has failed to deliver whilst djokovic has won AO 2008.    no doubt rafa and roger are the BEST players at the moment, and when they are healthy and confident, u can bet they win 90% of their matches.|`|YMh2IPWnaa	3rd is Djokovic with Murray a close 4th ..

VERDASCO(years ago i was like 'who is dis player????'but the fed cup and AO really2 open my eyes n i want to see more of him...at one point,i was hoping he beat nadal during d semi(eventhough im nadal's fan)...d stamina is so great and his game are quite prfect....we will definitely see more of him)  SIMON(he is great on court n off court too....he has a great personality and during his match,u can really2 see d commitment in his eyes...he had beaten all the top 4 player n it is just a matter of time b4 him winning any grand slam title dis year....)    others,RODDICK,TSONGA,CILIC|`|B4hNwK2haa	Gasquet has most potential, and i hope he'll break through this year.  Djokovic is the world's best player overall other than those 2. The rankings are there for a reason :D|`|evFCon1Waa	cmon verdasco. before last year no one knew  him. now he can take  1 nadal to a five hour 5 setter. this is a reasonable answer.|`|FUpGRYHQaa	Del Potro.|`|S17bl9wZaa	Djokovic has the best game.  murray is still a year away.  del potro is a great up and comer he could be 4 or 5 by the end of 2009|`|LhhsdxLmaa	andy murray,novak djokovich,andy roddick|`|RMxTrBnIaa	verdasco cause he beat andy murray and jo tsonga and took nadal to five sets|`|DEDmq2OWaa	Tough question?? You can say Novak- he has won a Slam? I have always loved Roddick (he did get a slam)- great longevity- he has really stuck in there after tremendous losses. Sick serve!!!  Murray is rising! Can't make that call given the two best still in field? They all present great competition to any player!

i5MInqeMaa	I think you can thank ESPN for over-hyping another Kobe moment and attracting more bandwagon fans.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Would you be saying the same thing if Wade score even remotely close to that amount?    Lakers fans obviously care about the record, at the same time haters care much more about the record because it just put Kobe that much ahead of their favorite player. I can see why some people would want to downplay a guy score 61pts in a game.|`|BiMkowVMaa	LOL! Enough that you had to ask this question.    What idiot said its an "NBA" record? LOL!|`|Mn97YDIyaa	It was a great performance and congratulations to Kobe, but it's being overhyped. Pau Gasol had 31 points, 14 rebounds, and 5 assists. I honestly would take that over 61 points, no rebounds, and 3 assists. I'm not trying to take away from Kobe, because his game was amazing. It's just being taken way too far.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	i guess you are right but that is okay|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	that record is soooo irrelevant. it only proves that Kobe Bryant is huge ballhog who leaves his teammates behind when the times are tough. where was the teamwork? Kobe Bryant can score all the points he wants, but the playoffs come, he'll choke really badly. watch, i guarantee the Lakers will choke like last year. let's hope there are enough psychologists for the millions of depressed Lakers fans.|`|PA7ryYR8aa	lol and did i tell you Kobe has the 2nd most points scored in a game.    MSG is the oldest arena!! great players have been in and out of that arena, but yet kobe has been the only player to score the highest.    And Jordan held the record for most points scored by an opponent at MSG|`|dcNT65mTaa	Him scoring 61 in the Garden is just about as meaningless as him pounding the Raptors for 81. Of course it's an amazing feat but I'd be much more impressed if he did it against a contender.|`|sCHUFUXsaa	its not a big deal for me.  i dont see why you get so mad about this.  some people care about it some people dont like you.    so its their opinion not yours..|`|UXHqV1xlaa	Because not everyone can drop 61 points in a night like Kobe can. Give credit where credit is due.|`|vyYhJ7PFaa	Bernard King > Kobe    Superman > Batman|`|YQLNqgnWaa	kobes career high is higher than jordans nuff said|`|GBGcI509aa	Agreed.
AA11105507	If he wants to, he will.  HHH has a lot of political power backstage, and is in on the production meetings.  He abuses his power to keep himself in the main events and he buries other wrestlers that he feels threaten his top spot.  That's why Kurt Angle and Booker T left for TNA.|`|wAiQOP0Laa	I used to think he would, but I'm starting to think he won't out of respect.    Besides, isn't Flair's title reigns closer to 20 anyway?    I'd say John Cena has the best chance of anyone to break Flair's record.  (Saying that just made me throw up in the back of my mouth a bit, but it's the truth.)|`|WQGvE60waa	If HHH beats it.    It will be a joke.    He can call the shots.    That would be like Vince gettign into the WWE Hall of Fame.    Bad press.    HHH Can have 44 reings and he still won't even come close to being the best wreslter ever|`|9FO07rRFaa	I'm certain he can...but may not want to out of respect|`|4JPuwbjaaa	HHH may beat Flair in quantity of title reigns...others may too, but no one will ever beat Flair in quality of title reigns.    16 is debatable. Depending on what you read or what you count, Flair's title reign range from 16 to 25 or so.|`|VQlrQ34Faa	Triple H will come close, maybe 15 reigns but he'll stop short out of respect for Ric Flair. Edge or John Cena will break the record soon.|`|6u2YkXjlaa	I think that HHH will but I hope that someone like Edge will then break his record because edge is still in his prime he has many many years left if he's not sidelined with injuries.|`|rH3ylNuYaa	He just has to keep sleeping with the bosses daughter more and for sure  he is gonna break it . Him and ric flair are both marks for the belt and being a 16 time or a 50 time world champion doesn't make you the greatest.|`|n55Vb81Faa	I Don't Think wwe will let HHH To do it , i guess Triple H might win the title one more time before retiring    i don't think someone will do it but if someone did it then i think Edge Will make it , he keeps winning the title from time to time , he always in the main event , he gets many title shots|`|JYrvt5s8aa	No, triple h died in a hit and run accident an hour ago|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	You would hope that Triple H would have enough respect not to sleep his way past Flair but i wouldn't put it past him. Without his title reigns what will Triple H be remember for? Two stables and marrying the bosses daughter, not much else IMO. I hope he doesn't.    Right now i can only really see Edge getting close to the the 16 mark, 7 already and he isn't near the 40 club yet so he has plenty of time.|`|k2fFfNtRaa	I think either triple h will or john cena will.|`|85tAhnM9aa	Ric Flair is a joke to me. Wooooooo. Wooooooo. That's all he does. I want Goldberg to come back.|`|yw8IeiPNaa	He will barring injury.He has the golden egg so nobody can stop him.
XnbcCgboaa	Michael Crabtree is a good bet to be drafted by the Seahawks, so I don't think Boldin will end up with the Hawks.    I'd love to see him on the Eagles, but I think he'll probably end up staying with the Cards as Fitzgerald said he would be willing to redo his contract to make more cap room for Boldin.|`|p0humGlPaa	NAH I THINK he should stay with the cardinals|`|wnhZQBMXaa	there no reason to go to seattle seachickens,holmgren is gone,qb is is old and broken,if boldin was smart he would sign with the niners,|`|e9065dfa2249178c642f3f273c9dbb1caa	why would he leave a super contender for a rebuilding team no i dont think boldin will go to seatle|`|khbLZQHIaa	If anybody in the league is going to need Boldin it's the Browns.|`|XrCc85kNaa	He should sign with the Eagles...  Just think how dangerous the Eagles would be if he signed with them...|`|Jp2415Whaa	Hell no, the only chance of him leaving the Cards is for Giants, THAT IS ALL.  Other than that, he's staying here.|`|9M8lEQDqaa	I would have to say Eagles also|`|rjuqrHK7aa	His contract has to expire first though. It doesn't expire until 2010. I say he will go where he can get paid or stay in Arizona.|`|Bnoz7N0Caa	no|`|C2CCbTRKaa	IT,S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY!!!|`|Esl2Ogi7aa	no most likely he will either stay or go to baltimore|`|6GPWIghMaa	no, although he would make the team better he should stick with the cardinals.|`|51bd60494429f94771a79adedd996e77aa	Somebody before me said the correct team.  THE EAGLES.    It would give Donovan a legit big wideout plus he would have Jackson to line up opposite or in the slot.  They would run through the NFC.|`|srIvu5PWaa	Where ever there is a good quarterback and good money.|`|8MTlXdBnaa	no he should sign with DA BEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4bc8ba55698a5aeaed5cdab5ca2f87b2aa	No, he is staying in AZ, Fitz is going to take a pay cut to keep Boldin on the roster. Besides with Boldin on the field that make Fitz better, teams do not double team Fitz when Boldin is in the game.

2cH8JeVNaa	Even though I agree with the removing the TV14 rating, I doubt that Cena's going to say that next week. Sorry.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	if you want bra and panties matches buy a playboy!|`|AA11482019	It looks like you'll stop watching.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Come to TNA and there much better than WWE    The only reason WWE has better ratings is because they have way more well known and liked wrestlers|`|6E16tR6xaa	Looks like your gonna stop watching wrestling.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Sorry Buddy but looks like your going to stop watching then.The chances of that happening a slim.      I don't understand hasn't McMahon noticed the rating's dropping?And some parents still don't even want there kids watching still.Some children are so impressionable and will actually try to give their friend an RKO or a FU etc.Wrestling is violence.They are trying to make it like the 80's again aimed toward families to draw them into it.I guess being a kid who started watching in the 80's but really started enjoying it was in the 90's during the attitude era.So really there wasn't really an alternative back then it,then they had the attitude era when most fans really started watching.So now everyone wants that again.Sadly though the attitude era is over.This is the PG era now.It will be a while I think before we see another attitude era again.Maybe once McMahon stars losing a lot of money and fans to TNA or something.Honestly can't see your wish happening there though sorry.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	You need to stop whining and complaining about WWE, it's not going to change and start watching Pro wrestling NOAH, Ring of Honor, Full Impact Pro, the NWA, New Japan Pro Wrestling, TNA and other wrestling promotions. John Cena is not going to lead them back to the Attitutde era, he makes too much money the way the WWE is right now. the Attitude era is not coming back unless the WWE feels like they are bieng threatened by other wrestling promotions and right now, they don't.|`|rjWlOAnEaa	I'm afraid that John Cena is too busy with "The Muppet Show" where he plays Miss Piggy, so he won't be able to come out and say that on RAW.|`|u02JAANXaa	I agree, also Raw has way to much talking now and not enough matches.|`|GhJtkZIKaa	I want to see some man on man and hot men; not nasty stuff like Viscera plopping down on someone|`|6nY99hPmaa	why the hell would john cena say something like that? ...he's the reason why everything is f***ed up in the first place.|`|XuX4lavPaa	Stop complaining you loser|`|PyJ3PMRnaa	It already passed.

sqfjfR3iaa	He may make occassional appearances, but he is not going to work full-time for World wrestling Entertainment. He is coming to Raw next week and will be involved in a storyline that will have him wrestle chris Jericho at Wrestlemania XXV. I think flair will win with the help of MIckey Rourke. I think the Nature boy will also be doing the Induction speech for Ricky the Dragon Steamboat at the 2009 WWE Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony. He may also still be involved in the Induction of Stone cold Steve Austin..|`|o9F9iJ8eaa	if flair wrestles at mania its gonna ruin that whole tribute and retirement he did. cant he jus retire and do something else|`|AA10957632	he probably is...........but he still can help outside the ring with promos and stuff..............i doubt he will wrestle again........ if Flair gets into a brawl, one of his wrestling friends will go out to help him and a rivalry will start between Jerico and that person.|`|2cH8JeVNaa	I think he's coming back next week to:  1) Teach Chris Jericho to respect the people before him, and then beat him up.  OR  2) sign a contract that says that Chris and Ric will fight at WM25, and then Ric will beat him up.  OR  3) Ric Flair comes out, and beats up Chris without even talking first.|`|DjuMbOJUaa	not for wrestling only for promotional purposes|`|h9PVRHPWaa	That wasn`t flairs first retirement. And just guessing it prob won`t be his last.|`|SLjdh5jXaa	HE WILL SIGN CONTRACT TO FACE CHRIS JERICHO AT WRESTLEMANIA! NOW: WILL YOU PLEASE GET A LIFE? LOL!!|`|hL3eS2zKaa	He retired. I think he MIGHT make occsional apperances on WWE though.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	i was thinking about it tooo tho but he could return like hogan return to team up with cena and hbk... now they probably making the storyline   jericho vs ricflair wm25.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	He is but,I think he will be like Stone Cold make occasional appearances.He is going to confront Jericho next week,because apparently him and Mickie Rourke consider each other friends.He is done wrestling,he might have an occasional appearance maybe a match as well.
fMWeRrJTaa	stretch every single day! do lunges, straddles, half straddles, butterflies, pikes, and oversplits. Hold your splits for about 30 seconds each and then stretch again then hold them again and so on. This will also help with heel stretches and jumps! For jumps just keep practicing them everyday and they will get better! I would reccommend being able to do a round off cart wheel back bend back walkover and maybe a back handspring. Just practice everything every day!!! good luck!!!!!|`|r8rykCkGaa	Gosh, don't know.  I'd forget it, really, but maybe they need you, huh?

L1QTSErIaa	Van Der Sar has always been a great goalkeeper. But if not for Man United's efficient back four, the record number of goals conceded would be higher. Ferdinand and Vidic have been outstanding and have protected Van Der Sar many times. <br>  Reina could not depend on his Liverpool's defence. Jamie is the only outstanding player there. <br>  Van Der Sar's better days are over. At 38, he is more mature rather then being brilliant. Reina is a better keeper. He is young and more agile. And he reads the game very well. So many times he had the vision to find his team mates with his long throws.|`|D7Dubtt9aa	I would honestly say reina not because i am a liverpool fan but van der sar is doing well at the moment but can be very prone to errors|`|6Q3YMo9haa	<a href="http://guideyou.crabdance.com" rel="nofollow">http://guideyou.crabdance.com</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|zu0W6hCTaa	van der sar. reina is spains sloppy seconds.

Out of Van Der Sar and Pepe Reina I would say Pepe Reina is better as i think his technique is much better.
Hiasgb75aa	Cup tied means you have already entered in the same Cup for a different team in the same season. This means if Arshavin has played in Europe already for Zenit, he can't play for Arsenal in the CL during the same Season. So he can't play any Champions League games this Season|`|VMBGniYYaa	Cup tied means if player has played for one team in a certain competition, they can't play for another team in the same competition.    E.g...    Mr.Player signs for Manchester City from Fulham, He's played for Man City in the FA Cup, so can't play for Fulham in the same competition.    Arshavin could be cup-tied for the Champs League if he's played for Zenit (old club) in the competition this campaign.|`|gpNIG15eaa	As Arshavin played for Zenit in the European Super Cup against Man United and in the Champions League,he can't play in the same Champions League for Arsenal for the remainder of the season.Overall Arshavin is cup-tied for Europe.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Nope because he's not played in the FA Cup this season.
3ULjjUNlaa	Well, take this into consideration, we KNOW they are both starting, and last time Conklin faced Nabakov at home, Conklin won 6-0.  Will it happen again?  I'm not saying that, I'm just saying, between Detroit and San Jose, the home team won every time.<br>  <br>  ADD:  Hope you started Conklin|`|UkW9FPEZaa	Nabokov is definitely the better of the 2, go with him.|`|LEQowzHCaa	I'd start Nabokov who has been playing really well lately for the San Jose Sharks|`|xRsiYmxPaa	if  your looking for a win  conklin  for sure|`|wiXXfzFyaa	well, i would go with Nabokov since, SJ is playing detroit, assuming that there is more chances the Sharks win, go for Nabokov, you would pretty be sure to get better stats with him.|`|PJ1IeqwAaa	depends who conklin is playing, but i would go with nabakov, you will still be credited with a shutout and his GAA will still be low even if he were to give up 3 goals, which is probably unlikely|`|WPCATkoYaa	Nabokov he is way better|`|XRBUkkEWaa	Kobe Bryant!|`|HJuOSvmdaa	I would probably do Nabakov if either, because the Wings will get over 30 shots on goal most likely, which should help your stats.

AA11667099	I had a similar problem... ok, so my experience was with paintball, but the aggressive premise is the same. When someone's being incredibly aggressive it strikes fear and causes hesitation or a full defense attempt, or the aggression just plane goes so fast that you weren't sure what hit you. Correct? If so, then the information to follow is how I dealt with the problem:    1: Watch what they're doing, the best way to overcome an opponent is to predict them correct? At this point you already know one thing: they're coming at you fast. So you have the first step to predicting them, and the rest you'll find varies very little from person to person.    2: Calm down, the easy thing to do is panic, but it's the least effective. If you get caught up in defending yourself, then you just gave them more time, and in this case time is your enemy.    3: Do what they do, you already know it can work right? Often when one is being aggressive, the last thing they expect is an aggressive reaction. This will also teach you through experience how their end of the deal works, and thus, you understand your opponent better and will learn to deal with them more effectively.    Honestly, that's what I did in paintball, and my success rate went from about 1 win per 3 losses, to completely the other way around. Now I'm guy everyone's afraid of... and it's a good feeling.    And remember, confidence is half the battle, every thought you spend thinking about pain or losing, is another thought not spent on winning.|`|7qczKTv3aa	Sounds like you might be an out-fighter. If that's the case you are naturally going to struggle with swarmers/in-fighters.  You might not have enough "pop" in your punches to keep them at bay.  See if you can pick up something that they're doing when they are coming in.  Hopefully you can land some nice counters as they're coming into you.  Once you do you should either tie up or spin them around.  Try to keep distance with your jab as much as you can and try to use lateral movement as well.  Switch up the rhythm of you movement too.  This might frustruate them as they try to move in.|`|OeD2sJt7aa	This may sound odd, but are you running?  The more you run, the better your stamina and the better your stamina, the better you can deal with those aggressive types that keep you hopping.  Also, and I know this from experience, are you trying to hit really hard or really fast?  If you try to hit hard, you are slowing yourself down and getting punched before your punches land.  If you hit fast, your punches will sting and your opponents WILL back down.  I know it sounds weird but when I stopped throwing hard punches and going for the knockout (I'm very, very, strong for a girl) and started throwing just quick one-two combos, I started winning fights.  My coach taught me that.  Work on your running and your hand speed. Find a way to make your style of boxing work for you.  For example, I have lousy defence.  I'll stand there and get punched and then throw my punches instead of slipping and blocking and then punching.  After trying and trying to correct this, my coach showed me how to "turtle up" so I wouldn't have to move away and I could still stand there and punch.  Not the best defence, but it works for my style of boxing.  Best of luck.|`|vGCetYmAaa	practice more!|`|GXrHjEgvaa	Maybe you don't like being hit in the face|`|hIOkdSEFaa	you have to press the action if you are pushing the other guy back he cant be the aggressor and if you are pressing the fight you will control the pace of the fight. but if you find that you cant press your man back then u got to become the boxer slick foot and head movement use your pivots after your  combo's ...be smart use your angles if your coach hasn't taught you how to fight pressure fighters and boxers than i think you need a new coach all my fighters can fight either way|`|SR5zlAl8aa	probably u dont like it pick me for best answer i dont have alot of points|`|XXtYOAK7aa	PLAY FIGHT NIGHT ON PS3 JUST DONT LEAVE IT ON OR ITLL MELT|`|6uJWQI03aa	you're just bagging on yourself. you have to believe and you will achieve! just keep it up!|`|GGAgxzJNaa	I'm no career counselor, but if you hate aggressive opponents boxing probably isn't your dream job.|`|72a8f6bb0546923e3c32d62e24eacb0caa	You have to suck it up and fight like you're fighting for your life.|`|JSeRWbHzaa	Mabby you are to soft and calm inside like a butterfly on a summers day.

If you are then you need to move and jab to keep them out of your box.  Even if you aren't you have to be a better mover than they are.  This dosen;t mean being a fidgety dancer but to only move when you have to and to throw clean punches.  The hard thing is if you want to keep the swarmers away you yourself have to always be very busy and in amateur don't always be backing off because the judges will always give the decision to the one who controlled where their opponent went.|`|UDxdII5daa	dude, just go full force who cares if a couple of teeth get knocked out! i do wrestling and body boxing but just strength train. and get stronger|`|mEUtKeN7aa	well, you have to get your stamina up really high so you wont get tired during fight. running or practicing on a speed bag should help. having fast reflexes helps you avoid being hit which you can work on a speed bag or boxing bag. you gotta use your brain and time your motions. looking in the mirror and practicing should help. you should also keep your hands in front of your face and  focal point is to just relax and keep telling yourself that you wanna win.|`|epAFmug9aa	yeah, if you intend on fighting it is pretty self defeating to be scared of an aggressive opponent. maybe you should take up knitting, or quilting.just a thought. maybe you can knit a pair of boxing gloves, or trunks.
c1d80dcfa0dbb3a12a30013ad59fa6b1aa	I don't really care that Phelps was smoking from a bong; really, whatever floats your boat - it obviously hasn't affected his swimming yet and it's his body.  I DO care that he was stupid enough to do it where he could be photographed...after he got a DWI a few years back.  Yeah, he's young and having fun, blah blah blah, but he's a dumb*ss.  If you want to be an olympic athlete, you have to deal with the consequences of being in the public eye and being a role model.  He could've forfeited his endorsement deals and making history if he wanted more privacy to "be a kid".  He already did something stupid in the name of fun once, the least he could do is be more careful.  I think you're right in saying that other so-called role models have so many more faults than Phelps, but he does deserve at least SOME of the scrutiny that he's received.|`|f9crUDTwaa	No . most people couldn't care less . There are real problems in the world .|`|gbn3iVZQaa	it's disappointing but It doesn't change what I think of him|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Sean...is that you?|`|19JRf8Cxaa	I don't at all. Michael Phelps is a great swimmer, but I don't think that we should be invading his personal life, unless he chooses to tell us about it. He is young, and all young people try new things (drugs included.) If all young people do that stuff, why do we care so much that he did? I have lost no respect for him and he is still the amazing guy that I looked up to before all of this happened.|`|HunSyQaSaa	Good post.I totally agree with you.|`|DVXypPKgaa	No I though it was kinda disapointing but i think that a person can do a million things right and the one thing that you do wrong people will hold you againt it and freak out.|`|DV4xyeChaa	like most people haven't tried it...i wish people would find something important to worry about...ah maybe the banking and economy problem...the world could be ending and the news would be whats Britney doing|`|PIekwLkoaa	No, it's only pot.  He is a role model, though.  He needs to get rid of the friend that took that picture.|`|PTBHLmZraa	yes, i do care. he WAS my role model. i am very disapointed in him. he is going to lose all of his endorsments. and yes, he did have a childhood actually.

3teWTOPqaa	sometimes being too unselfish can actually hurt you team, like when Odom is passing up shots after shots when he is not in attack mode.|`|dcNT65mTaa	Stats don't win games. U can score 50 a night and your team be in last place in the league. The biggest thing about being a team first player is it sets a standard that even the best player on the team will do whatever it takes to make his team better and in that motivates the role players to do the same, motivates the 2nd and 3rd option on the team. Its contagious and it leads to winning a lot of ball games.|`|gkSfxNQJaa	lebron james, even though i hate him|`|YQLNqgnWaa	steve nash  2mvps no fianls chip tho|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	well it depends on a lot i think. if yo have good stats and your team is a champion quality then no it not really unselfish because they are paying you to win, not just to play. in lebrons case he has to shoot, because that team has no players that can make their own shot. you can see it when he is resting on the bench.     I think you gotta make the finals though. playoffs are a guareentee for teams that are horrible all the way around. I mean look at the 16 spots and count how many of them you actually think will make it to the finals.|`|GBGcI509aa	B|`|ltGDrSbXaa	Depends on the team and supporting cast. D-Wade really needs to do pretty much everything, Lebron used too. Kobe doesn't. There's a stat out there that says the Lakers actually lose MORE when Kobe scores more than 40. Iverson doesn't. So it goes team to team.

This will at least be a watchable match.    Money in the bank all ways delivers for me.    Undertaker vs. HBK would be awesome, but if HBK ends up fighting JBL then thats another crappy match on the card.    Don't forget Jericho vs. Mickey Rourke I'm sure that will be amazing.lol    Wrestlemania is lackluster this year. What disappoints me most is that they haven't even started a program with Edge and Triple H yet and  everyone already knows that that's what it's going to be. We know Triple H is going to when the belt back just don't make us have to watch it at Wrestlemania like it hasn't happened before.    I would much rather see Edge vs. Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy for the WWE title that would be better to me.

Hell no!|`|uoIV59V6aa	nope cuz there can only 1 mj|`|PcxUNztLaa	Kobe is already better then MJ...    MJ was Overrated....especially in the watered down 90's|`|NzS7yD32aa	He still wouldn't be better but maybe equal    Kobe have had alot of help on is teams(all-star players) but who did Jordan have?|`|dcNT65mTaa	There can and will always only be one MJ. The most he can do is solidify Kobe Bryant's name with the greats, and I don't think that sounds all that bad.|`|0QI6S55Haa	all i know is kobe has an EXTREEEMELY small head XD|`|zN0aeqclaa	no way|`|o5XWImGsaa	maybeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...|`|PA7ryYR8aa	idk about better but pretty dam close lol, but if kobe does win 3 more championships, every great player that comes in this league will be compared to Kobe and MJ, not just MJ|`|cqRBSDzvaa	No,It wasn't shooting a great 3 pointer or scoring 61 points.what made Jordan the best was his leadership.He avereged a lot of rebounds,assist, and still scored 30 to 40 points a game.look at last nights game.Yes kobe scored 61 points a game but he had 0 rebounds,0 steals,3 assist.when Jordan scored 55 points in Madison square garden he also had like 8 rebounds and 6 assist.Kobe is a great scorer but in the end he is no were near as much of a COMPLETE player and leader like Jordan.Kobe is just not built to do good in assist or rebounds.He reallies on big men like Shaq or Bynum to get the rebounds and pass him the ball.In all honesty the closest thing to Jordan like numbers is Lebron James.In Lebrons first 6 years Lebron has averaged at least and I say at least 27 points, 6.7 rebounds,6.5 assist every year but his first and even that year he did good.His 3 point average through 6 years is twice as good as jordans was through the same amount of years and his team seems to get better every year because of him just like jordan.remember jordan was in the NBA for 8 years before he won his first title.Lebron is heading down that same track.I think Lebron will win a title before Kobe wins another one because teams know that in the playoffs all you have to do is double team kobe and the lakers are done.If you double team Lebron then you are screwed because you will play right into his game.|`|2Ko12Elfaa	Absolutely not.  Jordan still would have a better resume, better stats, better defender, and probably the best grace under pressure that we've seen.    On that talkshow with Ahmad, Webber, and Payton, they were arguing about whether Dwight Howard should be called Superman.  So Ahmad's like "Who's this?" and shows a picture of Shaq.  Webber and Payton have to admit he's Superman.  Then he goes, "Then who's this?" and shows a picture of Jordan.  And Webber and Payton go, "That's Jesus."

rJMZdp04aa	Take a Close look Tonight on RAW.    When the Ref's go for a Count , Notice it's -  1..2..Close their Fists & Pull up.  They Don't even attempt to leave an Open Hand.  It could Accidentally hit the Mat & Screw up the Match. (*Cough* Wes Adams)      *EDIT* - Oh , If you're asking how they know when to count to 3 and not stop at 2.  It's because Everyone in the Match , Including the Ref knows the "Finish" to the Match.  And it's actually the Ref who calls for the Finish & tells the Wrestler's to "Wrap it up".|`|JYrvt5s8aa	They have sex while counting|`|F3VjJAdiaa	well they know it's coming so they don't let their hand hit the mat for the 3rd time. i believe they usually get a signal saying it's time to wrap up the match and the ref signals the wrestlers and then he knows when it really will be a 1,2,3 count|`|MttuYrrTaa	every match is planned so the referees no when its time to count to 3.

HUQMqdDqaa	$400.00 for a Russian made SKS is not a bad price in this day and age. I just saw one earlier last week for $500. Bayonets are usually NOT sharpened, Marines sharpen their K-Bar's and are the only ones I know of that do that. A dull bayonet will cause a nastier jagged wound, a poke from a sharp bayonet will cause the wound to seal when the bayonet is removed so it is not ideal for causing blood loss/gut spillage.     The loose wood can probably be worked on. You have to consider the year of the rifle as well. It is probably from the 50's with the amount of wear you described. The price may also be attributed to all the parts having matching serial numbers, this is something you should inspect.    Do yourself a favor though, if you get it, keep it in original condition. Please don't "TactiCool" it out.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	I can get 2 for that price and have money left over for ammo, so no.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	Maybe if 10,000 rounds of ammo and a half dozen 30-round magazines came with the rifle.  But not a chance I'd pay that much for an SKS alone.    $200.00 would be a high price in my opinion.  If he won't cut that price by at least half, and 3/4 would be better, I'd let the guy keep the rifle.  After it collects dust for a while he will be much more reasonable.    Doc|`|YrxLbfiIaa	That's a $200 rifle ---- Pass on it --- Generally SKS rifles are not worth a lot - BUT there are a couple models / variations I would gladly pay $400 if it was unfired or near new and the stock had the color I liked....    http://www.samcoglobal.com/sks.html    http://www.sks-rifles.com/    http://www.surplusrifle.com/sks/index.as...|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	MD gave some answers that are right on.    Grenades are still available, just not live ones.    For more info on grenades and all things SKS, check out http://www.sksboards.com/smf/index.php?t...|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Since I'm in Cali and they are hard to find here, probably.|`|QrjuueMCaa	No chance unless there was a 200$ mail in rebate!!! Sounds like what you got there is a high-priced piece of ****.    Check around. SKS' are pretty common and you should have no trouble finding one for around 200. -Just remember...you get what you pay for unless you buy it at a pawn shop...then you just 'get it' up the ***.     Lock and load. Keep your powder dry!!|`|DV4xyeChaa	worth 200   so NO|`|M6fzLJtmaa	That seems to be the asking price right now for an SKS, if you really want it and think it's a good deal get it. Every know and than big 5 or turners has them on sell.  However that is a little high, my buddy got his a few years back for $250-300.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	well, if it's authentically Russian, it's worth more then any other in the same condition, but I wouldn't pay more then 250-300, try to make a deal with them, because I doubt anybody anytime soon will buy it with the recession coming.  it's used, worn.|`|AA11729094	It seems a lot of folks here don't know, or just forgot, that the SKS has many countries that made them, some are worth more than others. The Soviet SKS is averaging $400 or higher everywhere, but the ones I see for that price are in great shape. For about half that price you could get an unissued Yugo M59/66 that will shoot just as well as the Soviet. Norinco SKS's are going for the same price as Soviet builds, for the 1st time in the history of the SKS. Keep in mind, if you live in the peoples republic of california, you cannot own an M59/66 because it has a grenade launcher on it, though you cannot find grenades for these rifles anywhere.|`|WBGnXsr7aa	That would be someone trying to make fast money, absolutely no way is it worth that|`|AEzJHIz7aa	They're asking twice what top-dollar is for that gun.    $200 is high for a Russian in perfect shape.  They're not rare, and there's nothing special about them in the SKS family.  You can buy them for $150 from a C&R dealer (plus shipping, of course).      Walk away.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I must be old.  I remember when I wouldn't pay $60 for them.  That's what they were selling for, but I bought a Ruger mini 30 instead.  I paid $350 for it brand new.  I also remember being to cheap to pay $300 for some nice m1 garands.  The prices of all semi autos seem to be super inflated right now.  But, if the weapons ban passes, don't expect them to ever come back down.  Check around, I'll bet you have a hard time finding any Sks's right now for any price.  Would I pay $400, no I wouldn't, but if you want one, this may be your last chance.  Is it worth $400 to you.  If so, you'd better jump.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	For a russian Tula arsenal (arrow inside a star) and has passed an armorers inspection (I think thats what it's called) yes. If it's just some surplus gun that looks like crap it would be $250 here. Location also plays a role.    To brighten the bolt and charging handle get some 000 steel wool and water. Takes awhile but I shined mine up good. If it is a blade bayonet it wasn't sharpened becuase it's not supposed to be sharpened.|`|lT8MEI6Raa	Not a chance. My buddy got a brand new one (well, it had sat in the box in that waxy stuff for 50 years, but never used) for $250 about 2 months ago in Seattle, and it's pretty decent for an SKS|`|UJmfDAI9aa	I wouldn't pay $400 bucks for that. Just because the bolt is dull doesn't mean it is junk, a little Blue Wonder gun cleaner will clear that right up. offer him $200-$250 if it comes with mags.|`|Ui2WJH4Iaa	not when i could get a hi-cap wasr 10 for $325.  i never understood why Russian military rifles commanded such a premium.  there are literally tens of millions of them.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	The SKS is a good semi auto rifle the Russian variations especially. That said they some times come with attachments like Grenade Launchers ( a larger cylinder at the end of the barrel ) that may be illegal in your jurisdiction. I would get the serial number and go here  http://www.simonov.net/uberid.htm and see if there is no serial number then don't buy it. Also note the bore, and headspaceing if you know how which are essential to a safe and reliable firearm.

AA10667595	Past: Sampras  Present: Karlovic    Best serve is the one that is the most rarely broken, or is the most reliable. It has NOTHING to do with speed or variety. Roddick has speed and Federer has variety. But both of these men lose their serve on critical occasions. Sampras' serve was very difficult to break. This is why he was such a formidable champion. Karlovic has a very good serve as well, but the problem is that the rest of his game is not good enough to win majors.|`|SnnBvs8Iaa	Ivo Karlovic,John Isner, Andy Roddick.  I also remember Goran Ivanisevic and Milan Srejber(who  played his second serve like a first serve)|`|evFCon1Waa	first theres the answer lyin at your feet roddick but it makes you question it since he had like 80 aces during the australian open while there was federer 80. i mean roddick just has the best serve and people dont sleep at the champs feet to long they soon start goin for the underdog federer which will really have to start breaking the speed limit if he wants to contest with nadal. federer is on my list of best servers|`|S17bl9wZaa	Sampras has the best in history. his second serve was better than most players first in his era.  Nadal's serve isn't as impressive as most as far as aces and speed, but you can't argue against his first serve percentage and ability to hold. i've seen Roddick live (indoors) nothing is more impressive.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Past: Pete Sampras  Present: Roger Federer...|`|hCLmczgMaa	Right now i would have to say Roddick. It just goes wickedly fast and it is hard to return... but yet it isnt enough for Roddick to win because once he plays against a player who knows how to return he is done because he has no other weapons.    His serve is keeping him in the top 10. if he had an average serve he would be top 30|`|6S8KjBLQaa	Past: Pete Sampras  Today- Roddick|`|gP7IB2XCaa	i didnt really watch tennis in the past, but for the present it RODDICK|`|RC3WoqFkaa	past sampras. present federer|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	present roddick|`|iyDXt5d9aa	Roddick or Federer...but Rafa's workin on it =)|`|uX09rPGlaa	Past: Pete Sampras  Present:Roger Federer|`|eY1Vttiyaa	Present: Andy Roddick  Past: Pete Sampras  I think Andy Roddick's serve is better than Pete Sampras' which would make him the best server of all time, but he just doesn't have the skills around his serve, that is why he is ranked lowish.  And Roddick's serve is much better than Fed's.  His serve has just as good placement, but Roddick has much faster serves.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I can't tell you about the past because the guys that got me interested in the game are Fed and specially Rafa, but as for the present the best servers are definitely the Swiss and Andy. Roddick, that is! ;-)|`|ezxKSt5xaa	Roger Federer|`|NxQN1RkEaa	At present, it is Federer because he has much more variety in his serve (when he serves well), like top spin, kick, swing, flat,..etc. You can never quess which is coming at you when you play him.|`|iM5hHnG1aa	Andy Roddick has improved so much! killer serve... but you can't exclude Federer. He's got a good serve. and if you were watching the AUSTRALIAN OPEN... i think you'll agree... that Fernando Verdasco has a great serve too.
wphUIz0naa	They are not much harder than warm ones. One other note: You need to split the tail all the way down. If you don't the tanning solution will miss that area and the hide will rot there. I know all the fur buyers always want the tails split.   When you get some practice it will take less and less time to get the job done. I have an uncle that can skin a coon in about 3 min.    Just make sure they are not frozen or you will never get it done.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	ask Cletus from the Simpson's thats his favourite meal|`|AA11694178	Any cold animal is going to be a ***** to skin.  I've skinned cold squirrels, rabbits, possoms and they are all hard to get the hide off when they get cold.  It seems like the hide becomes glued to the body with epoxy.  Get a small bladed knife and sharpen it up very sharp and start skinning.  Ther is not shortcut that I know if.  When you get ready to do the job, go to a hardware store and pick up a pair of long gloves and a disposable apron.  You can also get a pair of disposable coveralls in the paint dept.  When you are done, stuff everything disposable into a plastic bag and toss it in the trash.  Salt the hides on both sides with a mixture of non-iodized salt and alum.  Allow it to dry and then roll up the hides and send them off to be tanned.  Forget tanning them yourself.  The results are not worth the effort and you will just be exposing yourself to that good old stink again.  Let the pros do it right.  You will be a LOT happier.|`|61H5wKfOaa	It's been a while since I skinned 'coons. I tend to use nitrile gloves and rubber apron to skin or cut up anything anymore. I know you can get "field dressing" gloves or trapping gloves that are rubber and elbow length which should help. When I worked at a fur house as a skinner, we liked to skin animals about 40-50 degrees. As far as the tail, generally you can split up one third the length of the tail, then cut away the skin above the base of the tail, work it down to the end of your split, carefully work your knife around the tail bone at the end of your split. Put your left hand (if right handed) on the coon body with your left thumb above the base of the tail, using your right hand, wrap your fingers around the tailbone at your cut and pull hard, keeping you fingers tight against the bone. It will be tough, but should pull out. If noe, split a little farther until it does.|`|AA10102776	beavers are supposed to be skinned cold. It is much easier...To correct the above post. Coons are tough when cold but the best thing I can tell you is cut a small hole in the rear leg near ankle, use a air spraying attachment connected to an air compressor and fill him full of air. This is very morbid but also very effective.
kGXU1Dotaa	Why should any of us stay loyal to this guy? The yankees made Joe.  Joe didn't make the yankees Joe had a great run for 6 yrs after that the team changed, the players changed, but Joe didn't change any decent manager would have won with this team.When the yankees did good Joe was flying high with praise when they did bad it was everyones fault Arod,Wells,Johnson,Brown,even Rivera but 'NEVER"  Joe.He was a loser before comming to the yankees always playing on   "B" teams hes going into the hall of fame by the op the yankees gave him.He sold out the club for a few bucks what a PIG.|`|fQIxah8laa	Ask Mike Francesca or Michael Kay.|`|6VOqfB5naa	Well, the problem with the book, is that people won't just shut up about it, and a-rod is over-rated, but, he.... is............. he...is... uhg..... he is a goo k........... an ok...... a good baseball player  i can't believe i just said that....|`|uh2bkRrFaa	What's your question?|`|4cJuKxJbaa	This is not a matter of win or loose...this is a matter of respect & lines that shouldnt be crossed. What the Yankees did with there contract offer was what they felt at the time the right thing to do. I didnt agree with it...but it wasnt really disrepectful. What Torre did is & was disrespectful..he didnt do it for the fame, he is already one of the most well known managers in baseball...the only reason he did this is Money...he thinks he needs more of it for some reason. It was just a disrepectful thing to do, he wrote a book about things he told players to tell him in confidence. That is a horible thing to do! You shouldnt tell another person let alone write a freakin book about it!|`|KDSA2OGvaa	The problem with the book, and I'm really trying to be completly honest here, not just defend my team, is that throughout his run with the Yanks, Joe continually preached that "what happens in the clubhouse stays in the clubhouse" and the  controversy is, well, writing this book was very hypocritcal and went completely against what he said for the last 6 years of his career. If the guys in the clubhouse call A-Rod "A-Fraud", and he really does have a "single white female attraction" to Derek Jeter, it should have stayed in the clubouse, it didn't have to made public. I respect A-Rod on the field, I think he's a great player who (off the field) has a lot of insecurities which is what leads to his bad (or shall we say no) performance in pressure situations. Joe even said in the book, A-Rod wants to make everyone happy- the fans, his teamates, the coaches, which is why he puts so much pressure on himself (I do also think he's a little starved for attention and shall we say...narcisistic). There are times though, where people say that the things that happen of the field shouldn't be dragged into the game. Odviously, I don't know if you feel this way, but if you do, than who A-Rod is as a person really shouldn't matter to you. If he is a jerk a real life, it shouldn't matter, because any one can see looking at the way he plays, he is a great player. Torre said it himself on Larry King Live, A-Rod is the greatest player he's ever worked with. He can steal a base, he can field, and he can hit. I'm not defending A-Rod here, because I do think he's a jerk but the bottom line is that he's a great player. Now, back to Joe, I had the utmost respect for him, I admired him so much. When I fell in love with baseball, it was Joe Torre' Yankees that I fell in love with, so I give him all the credit in the world for that, but I have to say, he broke my heart with this book. Even with the Dodgers I still admired him. I rooted for them in the post season because I truely admired Joe. I found the book to be completely unnecessary and badly timed (he's managing the Dodgers, I would think he would be focusing on that, even if it is the off season). He broke my heart, that's all I can say, I think alot of fans feel that way, and that's why there's a problem with his book.
GgaXDBaRaa	The Taurus has some really cool features like you might find on a Kimber or a Custom Colt... but you get what you pay for with guns, you know? There's a reason the Kimber with beavertail safety, decocker and night sights costs $1200+.     I personally would buy the Springfield (although I prefer the satin finish and wood grips for the classic look) because of durability and reliability.     Taurus has made some considerable gains in quality in the last 10 years... but they used to turn out some real crap and especially in .45 ACP you want a well made gun (the cheap ones explode). I have not fired the Taurus 1911; I have fired an old service model 1911 from Springfield and it was everything a sidearm should be.    IL, fmr. USMC 0351, Afghanistan Veteran|`|WBGnXsr7aa	I would go with springfield|`|8MUj24s6aa	Both make excellent 1911s. That Springfield is a pretty good price. I have a friend that loves his Taurus 1911.     I think based on those to models I like the look of the Springfield best. Function though to me are about equal...    According the links you posted the Taurus is available where as the SA is not.    Gwar: I am sorry but I would take the 1911 over a Deagle any day. Desert Eagles are bulky, have unreasonable recoil, are prone to jams, over priced, and are extremely heavy. They make great boat anchors but would rather have a .22 caliber North American Arms revolver than a DE.  http://www.gunsamerica.com/972746724/Gun...|`|M6fzLJtmaa	Springfield makes a great gun , i own a few.|`|803a466c10f04d50a006761a7ef5b803aa	Save your money and buy a Kimber or a Les Baer.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	The Springfield But mostly just because I can not tolerate Taurus' cheesy advertising billboards they put on the sides of their autos    Ever notice how the grammar nazis never even attempt to answer the question   Why is that|`|oZj6DfpKaa	Springfield all the way!

It could be he was more focused or a bunch possibility. It could be he just got lucky and you can bench more then him.  I wouldn't worry about it.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	No offense but yeah he can do more weight then you. So that means he is stronger then you in endurance and strength. You better train. Wow I actually work out and know my nutrition. He is stronger then you its the truth. He is stronger then you in the weight room that is.|`|51bd60494429f94771a79adedd996e77aa	Not really a football question. But that means his endurance maybe a little better than you.  It isn't an accurate measure of max weight potential.
DYAzanzfaa	Its a bit of everything ,depending on the result     If the plan works as michael clarke winning a couple games as captain...then ricky ponting might start seeing the end of his odi career, maybe not with the bat but most likely the captaincy    If the plan fails then it will be said that they had to give ponting a break so that he could come back in good form for the next games and the next series    Its more a test to see how the team will go if they try a new direction, but they dont want to stir up controversy by dropping one of theyre top players so say it is a "break"    Thanks    All the best|`|Dre0GbSBaa	unfortunately for him, his side lacks players to cover up his indifferent form unlike some hyped player somewhere else!|`|JdNhezdIaa	it's the start of the end for ricky he might play a few more one dayers but his days are numberd, and also demanding symonds be in the team when clearly the selectors dont want him wont of helped his cause, he's been riding the crest of a wave for so long now that we are finally seeing what he's made of, and i dont think australia really have anyone to take over as i believe clarke is the same sort of bloke they need a fresh face a real grafter like steve waugh was.|`|4VoQduaZaa	I think he is dropped.

I don't think he's been dropped, just look at his form with the bat in the series loss to South Africa. he was second highest scorer for both countries behind Marsh with 215 runs at an average of 42.8.  They may just be trialing Michal Carke as Captain to see how he goes with a view of having him as Captain and Ponting as just a specialist batsman.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	he has been told to take break|`|wz8gx3gaaa	He has clearly been dropped but gracefully under the garb of giving break.

You should play the position that suits your talents and size. If you are 5''8', 160 pounds you have to play in the secondary. If you are 6'2' 240 pounds, you should be playing on the line.    Look how fast the Steelers linebackers are.|`|3vFHi6KJaa	I an telling you a couple of things in football you have to be willing to get tackled. IT IS FOOTBALL.

Speed would benefit absolutely every position.  Slow is not an advantage anywhere.    But speed alone does not make you a candidate to play football.

In 2006 and 2007, he put up above average statistics.  In 2007, much of his success was probably because major league teams had little, to no scouting information on him.      As he pitched at the major league level, teams gained valuable information (how often he throws different pitches and other tendencies) and he lost some effectiveness.      Overall, Hill has pretty average tools to work with, and he has yet to overcome the scouting reports teams have on him.  Maybe this change of scenery will give him a boost of confidence.|`|mmbKlqLEaa	hes a bust

The key to the game, like most of the times Knicks play a deep team down low was Pau. Because Pau a 7 footer and we play small ball he was able to impose his will down low and a result was his 31 and 14 I think. Also, his presence alone made it easier for Kobe to get to the line through attacking the rim knowing that if he would miss - which was rare last night Pau would get the rebound over Harrington and Jeffries. Only one of the Knicks that was hitting the glass last night was Lee. Anyways, Gasol's presence in that he could hit the mid range jumper made it easier for Kobe against a small ball team to take more quality standard shots.    John S shut the **** up the Knicks are not a bad team we are much improved from years of being miserable. They are the 3rd highest scoring team in the NBA and are close to being 6th seeds so shut it.

HTiczN3Xaa	Why do you persist in writing everything in capital letters?|`|fsLMFIpgaa	It would be a dull game if every ground was the same.

New Zealand needs to fix this problme before they can host any major tounament.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	But both teams play on the same ground.  So there is no problem is there?.  And isn't T/20 about hitting 6's?<br>  <br>  All grounds in NZ are up to ICC standards.  Get over it.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	i like larger grounds|`|4cd30bf7558366b3b6c31ee6e5edf5d1aa	Not all New Zealand grounds are that small, some of them are a decent size but not nearly as huge as some of the Australian grounds.  <br>  <br>  The thing about it is that the ground doesn't change size for the different innings, they are the same size for both teams so it is all fair and if a schoolboy could hit a 6 on the ground then India should have got more than 160 runs but as you say they were greedy and didn't look to get singles and turn over the strike.<br>  <br>  As to if it is good to play cricket on such small grounds I think it's good for the 20/20 to be played on the small grounds because people expect to see lots of 6s hit in a  20/20 game, that is what they come to see so you get the bigger hitting, but don't worry the ODI will be played on larger grounds, The stadium at Queenstown is a really nice ground.<br>  <br>  Also as to the 6 6's in an over, I don't think you'll find too many unless the opposition has absolutely useless bowlers because it's up to the bowlers to adjust, for instance, how many players hit 6 6s in an over in last nights game? none.  Sehwag got 3 in a  row but then went out because the bowler adjusted to conter the batsmans charge.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	You have a valid point, but as I understand it, once the concerned boards have agreed to the conditions there is nothing much ICC can do, and they seem to have this problem: they can't alter the ground now. The smallness is there both teams, so that's n't a problem. And, let them hit sixes, that's what spectators want.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	Evan has summed it up correctly. It is the same for both teams, an "equal playing field" so to speak.<br>  <br>  And besides which, T20 has as much to do with proper cricket as rounders has to do with baseball! It is entertainment, and if you were going for a few hours excitement, then surely the more sixes the better!|`|nwZD5mzRaa	They have a point. Nothing can be done about the stadiums that have already been built. <br>  <br>  P.S. You do ask interesting questions, but please don't write in capital letters.

They must make a commitment that any new grounds built will be built to ICC specifications.<br>  <br>  <br>  At least with a small ground everyone has the same opportunity to hit lots of fours and sixes. With an unkept ground the home side who knows it well has an advantage.<br>  <br>  Australia used to be guilty of this, especially in Brisbane and Perth, sometimes these pitches were so bouncy and dry that you could have been playing on concrete, other countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan and India have been guilty as well for preparing pitches/grounds that give advantage to the home side. Even in England at Lords the home of cricket you will notice that the ground is hugely uneven, the outfield is on a huge slope.<br>  <br>  Things have improved worldwide in the last 5-10 years.<br>  <br>  *STAR*|`|eHcXI4jFaa	I disagree.  Why don't we just make every ground exactly the same and every pitch.  I think small, large etc, gives a great variety.  Plus watching 6 hits is entertaining is it not?  NZ has always had small grounds.  It is also an even playing field.  If any concern should be raised it should be at a woeful pitch (which it was not).  Though the variety argument can come in here.  Let's not streamline everything in cricket, variety is what makes different tours interesting.|`|xabjLTKqaa	i was surprised on seeing the ground .those grounds support baseball than cricket .cricket grounds especially for T20 must be large. sixes are easy to hit in this ground. so it do not support cricket|`|lSl7c4Ciaa	Its not like its a new problem nz have been using the same grounds for years and years but i will admit the need stoping moving the boundry ropes in for stupid advertising boards. Some of the NZ grounds are quite big and then you have Eden Park in Auckland which is the most retard shaped oval you will see with a short bondary and one thats alot longer on the other side. <br>  <br>  The main reason for the small grounds is they are mainly built as rugby stadiums as that has always been NZs number one sport.<br>  <br>  But as send above it is the same for both teams and i know for certain they meet the ICC requirements apart from maybe the side thats moved in for construction.<br>  <br>  Its my home ground though and ill love it matter what
A4tps9Klaa	GREAT debatable topic, especially since they essentially had their epic runs more or less simutaneously (Rock 1999-2002, and Austin 1998-2001). I felt those were their true "prime" years in the WWE. From an entertainment standpoint, both were PHENOMINAL. I think wrestling ability i would give the slightest edge to Austin, simply because he had a longer wrestling background than the Rock did (Austin had been wrestling since the late 80's, and the Rock began wrestling in the early-mid 90's out of college). That is by no means a knock on the Rock, who was better a wrestler than most mega - superstar wrestlers (ex. Hulk Hogan) based on his in-ring ability. I don't know its possible to say one was better than the other, but everyone has the right to have a favorite. Personally, I can't choose because both guys did so much for wrestling's epic run about 10 years back. I suppose this is one of those debatable things that will go on for a long time... lol|`|Cn9gUBamaa	Ability - The Rock<br>  Entertainment..................

jTNa0lwAaa	Really? I am a big football fan, but this is as stupid an argument as i have ever heard. It's sports, different people enjoy different things. Most soccer foreigners probably grew up on soccer like you grew up on football.|`|bT0kyzRPaa	fooball players knock each other around every play... soccer players fight like women kicking and if your lucky an occasional headbut|`|srIvu5PWaa	there is actually physical contact and is not boring|`|Ca8i226Xaa	There's a lot more scoring in American football.  How stupid is a sport where you cannot use your hands? It's unnatural.    I like the hitting in American football, and the men are just tougher; they are really warriors. Soccer is for boys who are not aggressive or tough enough to play football.|`|a6EndAPiaa	I am a huge football fan (note the Top Contributor badge).    Fans like you make me look bad.    Grow up.  Just because you do not understand Soccer does not make it a bad sport.    Someone posted a question in the last two days stating that during the Super Bowl there was something like 23 minutes of actual action the rest was commercials, huddles, time outs, whatever.  Yeah dude you are totally right football has 23 minutes of action and soccer has 90 minutes.  The average soccer player runs over 10 km during a match how lame there is no action there!    I can see why you need to ask others about Soccer because you do not have a single clue.|`|FZViLZi9aa	1. It is not soccer  2. It is not boring

I can do all kinds of dunks and im about 5'10...And I weigh at least 30 lbs more than him...    But yeah its all about the last couple steps you take before you jump... Instead of just running full speed and taking off quickly, try starting from like just outside the FT line and taking one big step right before you jump.... To get more power, make sure both your feet are set, then bend your knees and drop down a little, then explode back up...    Thats what i do and it works every time...Be sure to step INTO your jump..If you're right handed, your left leg should be the last one to move before the jump
sqfjfR3iaa	If ECW is cancelled then, that means world wrestling entertainment will have one less hour of programming every week. One less time slot, 52 less hours of broadcast time each year. That also means World Wrestling Entertainment can release more wrestlers, divas, referees, ring crew and office staff. NBC/Universal which owns the Sci Fi channel won't have to pay WWE Rights Fees to broadcast ECW anymore. WWE already has more wrestlers and divas on their pay roll than can wrestle on television every week, so WWE will do additional cost cutting.|`|9Us6XYg8aa	it order to make it in to a really good show they need to make ECW a two hour show.|`|w173betxaa	ECW won't have a future if they keep this crap up.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	ECW won't make it through this year, I think it would be smart for Vince to just fold the brand and take what's left of the talent and put them on RAW and SD.

6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	Best ground and pounders?    1. Fedor: He destroys people from their guard.  2. GSP is utilizing some of the best wrestling to help work GNP.  3. Matt Hughes will be one of the greats at it.  4. Randy Couture      Good wrestling (solid base), plus submission defense = beat the guard.    The truth is even in BJJ, the guard isn't considered a go to premiere position. Ideally you are in guard to escape an even worst dominant position, not because you intentionally pulled it.    People often associate Royce with the guard prominence, but if you really watch his early fights, he only spent time on his back against Kimo, he controlled position, he didn't lay in guard and wait someone out. Kimo was bigger stronger, and a better wrestler than him, so Royce was forced to stay in guard a lot. But most of his other fights he was taking backs and mounts.    In fact, most good BJJ players only end up in the guard against people who are better at wrestling and takedowns than they are. The guard has some offensive tools at it's disposal for sure, but what happened is a lot of people got REALLY comfortable working from the guard. This happens at a lot of BJJ schools. You end up with guys who spend hours rolling where they willingly go to their backs, and work from there for extended periods of time.     In MMA, this kills them. The people they are fighting have submission defense and a good base. They aren't swept easily, and they don't leave a lot open for submissions, furthermore they know how to defend them.    Whereas the idea is that no matter what the position you have some defenses and some abilities to win a fight on the ground, the guard is just one step up from half guard as far as the hierarchy of positions.    Ideally you want a dominant position, not a defensive one. Guard is a defensive position. It is losing it's abilities because it is no longer something that people aren't familiar with.     Guard passes aren't really rocket science, and the more one set of techniques is used, the better and better people will get at defending it, and beating it.    Because MMA is an evolving sport, people are learning new ways to fight, new ways to defend constantly. It is one of the reasons Lyoto Machida gives people fits, he doesn't fight like everyone else. So people aren't used to defending his style, or defeating it.    But that is what sports is about.    Take American Football.    Back in the day the Wishbone offense baffled people. Eventually people adjusted, they learned how to defeat it, and it's limitations. They designed defenses to counter it. The same goes with any style of offense, or any football play.    You can get that even with games.. if you are playing Madden and a guy is constantly killing you to the outside and on comeback routes, you stop playing man coverage and go to a zone, you learn how to beat him.    People have learned how to deal with the guard, it is losing it's effectiveness in the sport, but that is the nature of the sport, or sports in general.     I for one am very excited about the variations we could see, truly diverse and dynamic fighters now who are training their style alive and figure out how to use it to defeat the modern MMA styles.    This sport has evolved so much.. to a time where BJJ was king, then Wrestling and GNP was king, then sprawl and brawl was king, to now better and more well rounded guys who are able to adapt..    I look forward to exciting things, a revolution in training methods now that there is a place where people can pressure test their techniques and learn to adapt them, understand the bunkai and put it to practice to hone it towards further effectiveness.    It's exciting to me, it really is.|`|qJ6Qqstvaa	The fact is the guard was never key to winning a fight above lightweight.     Ground and Pound fighters today best are   Brock Lesnar  GSP  Fedor  Rampage Jackson  Randy Couture    These rules destoryed the guard    Striking to the spine or the back of the head.  THIS IS THE SECOND ONE THAT MADE THE GUARD INEFFECTIVE.  Fish hooking.   Grabbing the clavicle.  THIS ONE IS THE BIGGEST ONE THAT MADE THE GUARD INEFFECTIVE  Eye gouging of any kind.   Butting with the head.|`|D7P63K5Faa	The best GNP fighters are;  1. Fedor Emelianenko  2. Georges St. Pierre  3. Randy Couture  4. Urijah Faber  5. Eddie Alvarez    Yes, I agree in part that the guard is losing its "luster", however it can mostly be attributed to the increase in the talent level of GNP fighters.  As a side note, the guard loses it's effectiveness when your opponent covers his body in grease.|`|TH1fT6rdaa	Best GNP fighters are (or were):    Georges St. Pierre  Matt Hughes  Diego Sanchez  Tito Ortiz  Randy Couture  Thiago Silva  Dan Henderson    I do partially agree losing its effectiveness.  I know that Penn was beaten up by GSP, but his fatigue caused his guard to be so ineffective.  Did you see how easily GSP passed guard late in the bout?  Forrest Griffin's guard just looked lazy.  He never bothered to even close guard against Rashad, maybe because he was focusing on his broken hand.    However, there hasn't been a submission from guard since The Ultimate Fighter 8 Finale, where there were a lot of submissions.  It seems like the guard works best at the more inexperienced levels of MMA.  The best of the best know how to avoid submissions, but they still work well until the elite levels.|`|36u3Ml0kaa	Lesnar  Hughes  Tito Ortiz  GSP  Couture  Fedor|`|w9kSGLBxaa	No I do not think so. I think people are learning and creating new ways to use and get around it. Did you notice in Dan Henderson's last fight he did not want anything at all to do with his opponents guard. Being in there for only a short time got him close to getting caught in a few leg locks. Then you have people like Damian Maia. You sit in his guard your going to get swept or subbed real quick.     People used to say how ineffective boxing was, now fighters higher boxing coaches.    Here by the end of the decade your going to have a bunch of GASP and Fed or types that no matter where the fight is you could be in trouble, for the slightest mistakes. Whether that be top, bottom, scramble or standing.|`|a7jTJYeRaa	the guard is always going to be effective, however i do understand what your saying.. Gracie guard was so good cause it didnt matter what round he was in sweat wasnt a proble due to his outfit.  it is still the most effective way to protect yourself when on your back|`|b236e9c68adebf7ae2fb536ad0c0a09aaa	there are risks in the guard present in mma compared to sport grappling due to a person being able to strike you. griffins guard against evans was horrible all he did was wrap his legs around evans he didnt even try to control rashad's posture.    bj's guard main problem was gsp would pop out when he went to a high guard and pass.    to avoid being struck in mma in the guard it is super important to control your opponent's posture with your legs and also with your arms.    eddy bravo argues that rubber guard is good for mma because the positioning automatically controls your opponent's posture making it difficult to strike and you also have an arm free to work on submission    i wouldnt say it is losing its effectiveness people just need to be careful how they use their guard in mma    mark coleman is known as the grandfather of ground and pound|`|S0N3BRecaa	Fedor is the best.|`|9f53e05cc8ec82fa794d70c7c68ae1d8aa	To answer your first question,  1.

iOICjcZcaa	1. Probably soon. He's planning on retiring this year from what I hear and TNA isn't going to want one of its biggest stars retiring as a heel.    2. WWE fired him because he refused to lose weight. He went to TNA for a short while but left because of money issues. He's now opening a wrestling school in California.    3. I'm hoping HBK. That's the most likely wrestler now.    4. JBK and HBK will fight at No Way Out. Honestly, I don't see where it's going. If JBL wins, he owns HBK forever. If HBK wins, he gets his money and JBL leaves him alone. This little feud has given HBK some serious heat and he's been getting booed. I think it's going to lead to a match with Taker. I think WWE wants us as the fans to cheer for Taker so he can keep his streak. Taker even confronted HBK at the Royal Rumble.    5. No, I don't think so. He's won a title in UFC and he's pretty keen on staying there.    6. No, WWE tried to get him to wrestle this year at Wrestlemania for one last match, but he refused because he wants to focus on his acting career.    7. Yes, he is. He got an offer from TNA and said that he would wrestle for them if they were willing to pay him the amount he wanted. He announced August 22, 2008 that he was training for his in-ring return, although he didn't clarify where.|`|zD04jTz1aa	oo i thought u meant the real wrestling sport wel if you havent noticed or known that is fake and stupid duhhhhhhhh and real wrestling is way harder and the second hardest sport|`|41WXZPnCaa	when will sting turn on the MEM?

SQRPMy5oaa	He is a quitter. Maybe he should go lift some more pebbles under the ocean. He has done nothing but mouth off and I was happy to see him quit like a little ***** that he is.    He is the same loser who said he was going to fight to the death and called GSP a ***** for tapping to strikes. What a ******.    His corner didn't quit for him, neither did his brother. He was the one who motioned his brother that he wanted to quit and didn't answer to the bell.     Yes, he's a QUITTER and a LOSER.     He can't even lose with dignity, he filed a petition against GSP for alleged use of vaseline on his back (which was wiped off by the athletic commission btw)    EDIT: Delta sig is a moron who doesn't seem to know anything. BJP is nothing but a quitter. Just because you have your corner do the quitting for you, doesn't give you a clean slate. BJP could have very well stopped them. He also never answered the bell, indicating that he wanted to QUIT.    So yes BJP IS A QUITTER AND A LOSER FOR INSULTING AND MOUTHING OFF AGAINST GSP.|`|g7xaB57Xaa	Well, what I always ask myself when this happens, did BJ try (even a little) and look like he couldn't continue or couldn't he help how high he held his head after the 4th round next to his corner.  Find someone who was right there before "he quit", looking at his facial expression, his words to the corner, and the corners reactions.  Maybe he isn't a quitter, but compared to GSP, ahahahahaha, what a idiotically boastful thing to call GSP in the end.  All we know is, that didn't seem to be the same BJ in there that night from past fights, just his efforts of what he did try for....|`|LFLflsWFaa	BJ Penn was pretty disappointing during his fight with GSP. He didn't seem like the same fiery fighter. I don't even support BJ Penn but I was expecting a fight through round 5 no matter what the outcome. I'm guessing the stress of not-eating-his-own-words got to him. I hope this defeat will make him a stronger person, and not a bitter apple. I'm from Hawaii and this guy just needs to relax and smile.    So.. I can slightly agree with you. In a sense, BJ Penn was not defeated by GSP in the end, but himself. He should've stuck it through round 5.|`|Qn6ERwZcaa	Penn is a manure-talker and a quitter, yes.  all that talk for nothing, Bj--what happened there, Baby J, oh, buddy?  The moral of the story, if you have to talk crap to get in someone's head, you're worthless and you're the equivalent of a whale's vagina.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	They're both great fighters. but I like to see the fighter who talks the ******** smack get beat down. They all talk the talk but some are worse than others. mat hughes and BJ penn......and they both got beat by the more respectful fighter who ran his mouth less! HA!.|`|IRNvfdB9aa	Only a coward fighter-basher would call BJ Penn a quitter because there hasn't been a single instance that can be sourced as proof of him quitting. Never. Not once.     E|`|w9kSGLBxaa	I would like every single person in here that said that he is to go get beat down by GSP for 20 minutes in a weight class that is unnatural for you. People that really understand the sport know that fighting in the right weight class is EXTREMELY important to both your safety and cardio. B.J. is a very proud fighter and if his corner had not stopped it he would have gone back out there and gotten hurt and maybe permanently so I think the end of the fight now matter how you want to look at it was justifiable...even if B.J. decided to not continue|`|LnJjS8BRaa	I by no means follow these things closely but I've heard that Penn has a problem with prolonged fights. He makes a commitment to fitness but if you're talking about his latest fight against GSP then it's just a matter of the other guy working harder for it.     No hate to either fighter, they're both greats in the game.|`|hmJ9zcbRaa	Not really. he totaly ate his words tho for calling GSP a quitter and then throwing in the towel before the 5th anf final round. but no BJ Penn is still an awesome fighter GSP jus proved who wears the pants in the ocotgon.|`|eyMparPfaa	BJ entered the cage with a soft physique, and he weighed 168. GSP entered the cage with a ripped physique, and he weighed 187. GSP easily has around 20 pounds more muscle than BJ Penn. When a lightweight fighter spots his opponent 20 pounds, he is going to lose a vast majority of the time, especially when the opponent is just as talented. GSP fought smart. He did not box Penn in the first round because he knew that Penn could bang with him in the first. He instead smothered Penn with his strength and wrestling. He wore Penn out, and then he beat him up. He did the same thing last time, except GSP got tagged with strikes in the 1st because Penn was not yet physically exhausted. Plus, the additional round really wore Penn out. You cant defend yourself when you are completely exhausted. You cant hold your hands up to defend strikes, and you cannot really prohibit someone from passing your guard. Anyone who fights or trains knows this. I dont see why everyone is kissing GSPs butt for this win. He was supposed to win.|`|FpJ2qvrCaa	yup pretty much, they asked him if he wanted to continue and he didnt say nothin, so that means you obviously dont want to continue, he could have said yes but he didnt want any more of GSP and he knew he was done, point blank it was a rap after his fat @$$ gassed after round 1.|`|Peqg7xIRaa	Absolutley a QUITTER......He really talked up a fat game even after it was obvious that he was no match for GSP. It just goes to show that all that jaw-jackin, lip-flappin', s %t talkin' will get you nowhere but embarassed. BJ penn needs to take his out-of-shape *** back to Hawaii and stuff a can of Spam in that big fat mouth of his.......|`|6wSmZrrsaa	I was going for GSP, but I believe it was the doctor who called it quits for BJ. We all knew this would happen any way|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	sometimes you have to swallow your pride and admit that the better man won in a brutal, dominant fashion. `|`|AA10240928	I thought BJ refused to answer the 5th round because he told his corner that he didn't want to fight.  But now everyone is saying that the ref stopped the fight.  Is this all damage control by Penn and the UFC?|`|gERaZGZeaa	His brother made the symbol of him quitting because BJ was even too much of a coward to do it himself.  He wasn't coming out of his corner, no matter what.  BJ quit - if he hadn't, he would have faced GSP for a 5th round instead of hanging his head and remaining motionless.|`|b0faTDlJaa	Bjs never had good endurance, he does decent for the 1st few rounds then he fades away. He wasnt gifted in the endurance department and theres nothing he can do about it. No amount of training is gonna bring him up to GSPs level. The truth is Bj himself stopped the fight via his bro. So basically he verbally tapped due to strikes. Hence he called himself a *****.|`|925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	Not a quitter, but he doesn't train as hard as others.  His conditioning again proved to be lacking.  He did fine in the first round.|`|b236e9c68adebf7ae2fb536ad0c0a09aaa	not really. i mean he was a d*ck for calling gsp one. however in the fight he did not quit his corner threw in the towel they didn't see a point in bj continuing considering gsp had at least 3 out of the 4 rounds already and the only way bj was going to pull off a victory was by submission of ko and since gsp was imposing his will it was not likely. no need to continue the beating

4owr19vCaa	Test the mag feeding by loading it and press the BB release, you should get a shower of BBs everywhere.  So the mag is working.  Best get a large ziplock or a plastic grocery bag to contain the mess :)    If not, it could be you're not loading it correctly - if it is a hi-cap you have to pour the BBs in the loading hole (not through the BB feed / release) and wind the wheel many times until the torque sensor kicks in and makes a deeper clicking sound.    it is better described here  http://www.airsoftgi.com/information.php...  under "hi-cap anatomy"     If you have a mid-cap or low-cap you can use a speedloader or the crappy loading tube.    If your mag is correctly loaded and tested working, see if the mag "wobbles" or has play when it is inserted.  If it feels loose try and eliminate the wobble by applying pressure from various sides, and even pushing it into the magwell.  If one of the points make it start firing, then apply several layers of electrical tape on the mag itself (or the magwell, if all your mags have the same problem) so it applies pressure in the same direction to eliminate the wobble.      Cheers and good luck

1035b561c3cc75bd52fa0a1ec4ef8d3caa	The 1980 olympic game, gave american's a sense of hope. That the soviets are beatable and if a bunch of college kids can beat a bunch of ex military people in a sport they dominated for years, the world forces can beat the soviets.    It helped give support, it also gave Russia doubt because they realized there is always a way to be beaten.    And because Team USA vs Soviet wasn't the last 1980 olympic game it helped Team USA believe they will win gold.     Because of all the bad things going on at that time Americans felt like there wasn't anything to be happy about, The Soviets destroyed the NHL teams, people were being killed left and right, but for that 1 team that 1 hockey team filled of young college kids, some who completely hated each other, to unite and defeat a team that trained professionals couldn't accomplished gave them hope and pride    That olympic year really opened american's eyes to the fact that if people put their mind to it they can succeed.    Hope that was helpful mate|`|DvBPLP4saa	It gave America something real. Something to be proud of and something to feel good about. If you know anything about history you'd understand that Russia was the USSR. Communism.     52 Americans were held in hostage in Iran. So America was going through some very ROUGH times. I was not alive at the time, but I'm a huge history freak and have read up quite a bit on that time. If you'd like to read some more on the hostages you can read here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostag...    So not only was winning the Olympics a sign to the great Russian team that they weren't the only hockey skilled country, but it also gave America pride, happiness, and something to celebrate during a tough time.      Weepy - So what's that suppose to mean? That you're ignorant?     Mike Modano  Patrick Kane  Brian Leetch  Chris Chelios  Pat LaFontaine  Mike Richter  Keith Tkachuk  Dougie Weight  Tim Thomas  Jeremy Roenick  Bill Guerin  Chris Drury  Zach Parise  Paul Stastny  Ryan Miller    ^^^^^You know what that great list has in common? AMERICAN.|`|AA10068004	Pride on both parts is what I remember the most. Great time to do well on the world's stage.

V0qWtXOtaa	That happens to me every time.The dealer told me it was because they go by numbers as well as name checks and my name is very common . Don't worry about !|`|f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	If you have a common name, you probably got crossed with someone doing time, I've had a lot of clients who can't understand why they don't pass a background check, and then when I run a criminal history there are 10 or 12 guys who are the same race, about the same age, and all convicted felons.  They have to do fingerprints every single time they buy anything.  :)|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	Sometimes it's as simple as the computer being down. It's a pain in the rear (the primary reason for the background checks in the first place) but probably meaningless.|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	it's the law that if some one buys a hand gun they have to put it on 30 days hold. then after those days you can get your gun.|`|UJmfDAI9aa	Your name and profile probably got flagged for being identical to someone wanted for a crime or had committed a crime in the past. Just means they need to review your background a little further but depending on where you live, you just wait 5 days or whatever and if the ATF hasn't called the gun shop to tell them not to sell to you, then you are clear. NICS rarely goes down, they use that as an excuse so as not to arise panic in the buyer.|`|DV4xyeChaa	my sister and wife had same problem [virginia] maybe busy computer [thanks obama] or they moved here from NY and Mass....maybe they /check there...both took 4 hours...but picked up next day...[walther 380 and a ruger 22 50th anniversary|`|9bUxbTJAaa	There is a 72 hour  waiting period  to pick up a handgun fyi in some areas weekends do not count.

a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	Initally you may have some difficulty running the 1/2, and the calorie burn and muscle toning will seem to manefest itself quickly.  But the body is designed to adapt and become more efficient, so you will reach a plateau where burned calories and muscle toning will actually not be as great.  To deal with that you would need to increase to a mile,but the same thing will occur.  In order to manage that, once you get to a mile, mix up the effort, some days very slow, other days add a couple of 30 second sprints in the middle of the run.  The increase in intensity will prevent your muscles from adapting too quickly and you will see even greater trimming and muscle tone.|`|iPWKzzQtaa	That's about 5 mins of exercise per day.    That's good for cardiovascular health only. You would not lose any fat.    If that's in a gym...you should have a 30-60 mins workout including weights and abdominals...running included. You would see some changes in 3 months.    To see any benefits from running you would need 30 mins..about 4 to 5 days a week. Or 3 days a week with some cross training like swimming.

sqfjfR3iaa	The Following information is from Pro Wrestling Torch shortly after the Royal Rrumble:    Former WWE Intercontinental champion Rob Van Dam has an "open-door policy" with WWE to make one-off appearances when it suits his schedule and would increase his profile for projects such as RVD Radio and RVDTV.    Last night's Royal Rumble entry was part of the working agreement between WWE and RVD, with WWE contacting RVD on Friday to ask if he would be a surprise entrant in the Rumble.    "The idea to be in the Royal Rumble is only two days old," RVD said in a WWE Universe chat. "Got a phone call Friday and it worked out."    As we reported last week, RVD has no intentions of returning to WWE full-time, as his RVD-themed projects continue to occupy his creative energy. He was simply back in WWE for one night.    "Still happy at home. I'm not here full time by my own choice," RVD said. "I appreciate the open door that I have here."|`|3icTrKLLaa	No.    He was just a special guest in the rumble because it was close to his home town.|`|7rpILeYtaa	RVD's Royal Rumble was for one night only    however, WWE has left the door open for him to return when he wants, although i dont see that anytime soon as he is taking care of his wife who is suffering from colon cancer|`|fmUGHvgHaa	Well i wish he would but he wont because his wife have cancer and he is recovering her, he just came to rumble because the royal rumble match was in his hometown....

Or Pete Rose!|`|NgL2Onqhaa	I'd wager it was a one time only, kinda like Trish on RAW the other week. but it does clarify that he is in good standing with WWE so if the other poster is correct about his personal issues, RVD will  more than likely be welcomed back when the time comes|`|vPpiHZSSaa	Naw. It was just a waste of rumble space not that I don't like rvd.|`|DjuMbOJUaa	Nope not at this moment. he is taking a break from wrestling except for a few exhibition matches, he may come back in the future|`|fTZcTTqMaa	1 OFF AS IT WAS IN HIS HOME TOWN

09bb75ae04a4647a4d5ec1e5d3fcc319aa	The blue flag means "Get out of the way, faster cars are approaching."  I would be surprised on how many drivers really see that because what you dont see are the spotters up on top of the track telling their drivers that the leaders are right behind them.  A lot of the time spotters will walk over to another spotter and let them know they are on their way, and as for a little help on getting out of the way.  <br>  <br>  If a car is on the lead lap they will fight like crazy to try to say on the lead lap, or the first care one lap down.  Drivers down more than 1 lap are normally pretty forgiving when this happens...|`|EHtFxGxMaa	The blue flag with a diagonal orange stripe. <br>  <br>  This is the "courtesy" flag or the "move over" flag. It is the only flag that is optional. A driver may, at his discretion, ignore this flag. <br>  It is displayed to a car (or group of cars) to let them know that the leaders are coming up behind them and that should be courteous and move over to let the leaders race. <br>  <br>  Again, this flag is optional... However, NASCAR takes a dim view of anyone who repeatedly and without a darn good reason ignores it. <br>  <br>  I don't know of a solid blue flag.|`|mi9iaKHhaa	It means to move over. It is displayed to a car (or group of cars) to let them know that the leaders are coming up behind them and that should be courteous and move over to let the leaders race.|`|RR4CQYdgaa	It signals to slower cars that are a lap down or more to move over because the leaders are coming.|`|smR7Tr6Oaa	move over|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	it means for you to move over because there is a faster car behind you|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	It means move over because faster cars are about to over take you.  It's actually blue with a red or orange diagonal stripe. Also I'm not sure what road courses Tazer Harter has been at but  the ones i go to use a blue " move over " flag and  the yellow is used two different ways. The marshals of an corner will hold it out if the trouble is in that corner but the track is clear. "Local Trouble no passing allowed" and they all wave it if there is a full course caution.
XnbcCgboaa	Yes I do, I suggested this here like a month or so ago and people said boo.    It would be so much better, as it's the Championship.  Especially if you have SB's that are close like the one on Sunday or like the Rams/Titans in 1999, or Eagles/Patriots 2004.|`|8MTlXdBnaa	no the players would be dead     imagine if you will these kinds of match up playing for three weeks straight    Baltimore and new york  Baltimore and minnesotta   tennessee and NY  Tennessee and MN  Pitt and NY  Pitt and MN  (thoses are the most physical playoff teams.)  some one would actually die|`|RVdAXPDRaa	It would be extremely hard to set that up & get the teams to do it. The only thing about the Super Bowl, this year, is that I don't believe it proved which was the better team. It was so close that I think The Cardinals would win at least one of the two remaining games in a 3 game playoff. In my opinion The Cardinals could very well win both of the other games.    With that stated, I must say The Steelers accomplished an amazing feat when they scored their final touchdown. Usually when that situation occurs the team which is 3 points behind will only be able to get in position to score a game tying field goal.|`|Bnoz7N0Caa	Nope|`|FReGm4i7aa	no, superbowl is the big game.   if you wanna watch series then watch baseball..|`|C2CCbTRKaa	ONLY DONE IN BASEBALL AND BASKETBALL.A REMATCH OF THE SUPERBOWL WOULD BE NICE.|`|1Yal1pOkaa	no cuz having 1 game adds alot more tension and guarantees a shot for the little guy ,u drag it out,the better team will always win.....whats the point, why watch when u know the better team will win???????    Look at the ratings the superbowl has now!! dont fix it if it aint broke!!|`|kxMDFPnbaa	no football has been the same way for as long as i can remember..that would be dumb if all the other matchups were only ne game and then the superbowl was two games...i think the whole hype of the superbowl comes from people knowing that it is the last game of the season and it is going to determine which team is the best in the NFL|`|tNerdFYsaa	YES thatd be so awesome|`|YCwmCDkUaa	This is a ridiculous question...|`|xxtvhn5Naa	yeah that would be cool, but i wouldnt work.  that meens there would have to be one week in between each game, because the players couldnt handle back to back games... i would be cool, but it wouldnt work|`|72b1b35e81e7d39e237e18972e90ad30aa	There is a reason we call it a SUPER BOWL....notice no 's' at the end of bowl...Truely a american and world event..held in the city of lights for the thousand and millions to enjoy..Here is my vote to make it a national holiday....When we celebrate 5 crew members that saved 150 others on the hudson...We celebrate true american heroism..overseas..and we rock with the likes of u2 and springsteen..This is not your ordinary day...This is a national holiday..one day|`|p0humGlPaa	nah it will be boring see back 2 back games|`|4bc8ba55698a5aeaed5cdab5ca2f87b2aa	Thats the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Come on.|`|xZJZNpIlaa	dumbest idea ever|`|AJEDjzC1aa	Nope, Reasons being too many injuries and it would get very boring|`|VH1ze729aa	No because I don't think the hype would last that long.|`|KqXra3qFaa	no!! that would be stupid|`|IKgeknYZaa	yes to see if the first was a fluke like a lot of teams|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Would NEVER happen, ever.  First of all, the Superbowl is the big game, the premier sporting event in the country.  People who don't even like sports watch the Superbowl, even if its only for the commercials.  Why is it so big?  Its THE championship game.  No other professional sport has a championship game, they have a series.  Unless its a game 7, you have no idea if the trophy is going to be handed out that night.      Another reason it will never happen is the almighty dollar.  So much money is made during the Superbowl for advertising, and companies wait to unveil their new commercials then because they know everyone will be watching.  Do you have any idea how much money they would lose by making it 2 out of 3 games.  They couldnt charge outrageous prices for airtime because no one would pay it anymore, knowing that the viewing audience would be dramatically decreased.  Yeah, the football fans would watch all 3 games (if there were 3), but the excitement level would drop and the viewers who never watch another football game all year wouldnt be watching.      The whole idea of a single game at a predetermined "neutral" location for the championship is one of the things that makes the Superbowl special.  Theres no way it will ever be changed.
orqx98REaa	most cleats are the same as shoes they depend on the brand. If you wear a 8 in nike and you buy a nike spike get an 8. Stick with a brand you know and get the same size.|`|RsTm8uUlaa	It generally the same as your normal shoe size. You need to remember some brands run small or large. Such as Nike, they run small compared to Reebok. Best way to find out is to try them on. If you don't want to buy them in a store and you want to buy them online for cheaper or something, go into the store and act like you're looking to buy some, try them on, and then buy them online. There's nothing worse then buying cleats that don't fit right.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Um...you put your foot in the shoe and try it on. I know it's like rocket science to you. Give it a shot or see if you can get an adult to accompany you.     Hope this helps.
sqfjfR3iaa	If price is no object, you could have bought a wrestlemania XXV tour package from the WWE Wrestlemania XXIV Weekend. That was late March 2008, This is February 2009. Most fans bought their tickets months ago. You may have to try a ticket broker and you are going to pay several times the face value. You could try ticketmaster.com, just in case there are additional seats release as the final configurations for the building are put in place. Cheap will not get you low level seats, good luck with that.|`|3icTrKLLaa	Are you saying you are selling tickets at a cheapened price? Or do you want to buy tickets?    Either way i already have great lower level tickets.|`|RrEESD6Paa	I can definitely help. The best thing to do to find cheap tix is just to compare as much as possible. I would recommend checking out the website BookMe. You can compare ALL the reputable sports ticket sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck! Check out the link below.|`|vPpiHZSSaa	I think they are sold out dude. Especially lower bowl tickets. Not to be mean, but good luck finding those. Don't buy tickets if the wrestlers look like ants it won't be worth the money.|`|s5IjyOygaa	they're not sold out. go to ticketmaster.com or stubhub.com|`|hL3eS2zKaa	You mean this year's Wrestlemania? Sold out since November. But If you wanna get into next years' WM, buy tickets A.S.A.P.  Spend all you can.|`|yqJ536wdaa	IT depends the timing on when your buying your tickets. I got my tickets on the presale date and we got tickets on the risers for 150 each. And when the event is getting closer most places knock the prices down
GhJtkZIKaa	Excellent question. I used to have a mad crush on Randy Orton and still think he looks hella hot especially when he first comes out but I am growing more and more attracted to CM Punk so I have to go with CM Punk. I wish I was his boyfriend ;)|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	Randy Orton definitely. And he's even better in the flesh!!!|`|BglekVnQaa	CM Punk. I love the jet back hair, the lip ring, and tattoos. Kcatz and Liam you're homo!|`|KXmMlqA9aa	Definatley Cm punk. He is so hot! I love his extreme style. Randy Orton is just BLA to me. I actually don't find him attractive.|`|g6YliGIfaa	randy orton|`|O21k4xn1aa	Depends on your taste in men really.  I'm not the best one to answer this question in the first place, but if I was a woman/gay man, I'd pick Orton just for his muscle tone and sheer manliness.|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I have to say Randy Orton....Hands down!!!|`|Tsv6zyawaa	Neither! jeff Hardy is! =)|`|hL3eS2zKaa	Randy Orton. Not that I think he's hot, but CM Punk just doesnt look right (sorry to diss him). I think Jeff Hardy is so.........sorry, but ?_?.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	I suppose this is what the WWE Fan has become    Sry im not into rating guys on hottness|`|SOuezSW2aa	cm punk is hotter cause his eyes are so sexy.|`|E7TkNO00aa	CM Punk is hotter. I love it when he smiles.|`|wi37WScSaa	well, honestly, they're two very goodlooking men. cm punk in general isn't my style, but he is pretty cute!    i guess i'd have to say randy orton though.|`|2cH8JeVNaa	They both look really good! I like the longer hair on guys, so CM Punk is the hotter one.
AA12379904	You wouldn't be able to board with it.If you did get it on they would find it in  UK and it would be taken off you and probably a court case.You are not allowed to import weapons without a licence.You may be able to buy it there and send it on.But the import duty could be high.|`|U1OCUW8qaa	if they confiscate bottles of water what chance you think you have with an air pistol? lol|`|iLyUgl24aa	It will get taken...your best bet is maybe check if you can send it ahead|`|hPzil3Hiaa	SEND IT AHEAD
DFug1qB2aa	dude if u have 19mm then that means that they must be sealed so then u just lightly tap them in with a hammer and then lightly tap the axel in there too i dont have any cups on my frame its a fly mosca 2 so there already built in|`|1f2275fd28d7683c5e7a9cf2d702e88aaa	You just press the bearing into the cup. Its not hard at all. You should really get a frame with mid or euro...they are WAY better.
WZvny7mMaa	He has had 5 career 60 point games    81 points vs. Toronto Raptors on January 22, 2006  65 points vs. Portland Trailblazers on March 16, 2007  62 points vs. Dallas Mavericks on December 20, 2005  61 points vs. New York Knicks on February 2, 2009  60 points vs. Memphis Grizzlies on March 22, 2007|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Who cares?|`|ZCzAhuafaa	3 or 4|`|uoIV59V6aa	alot|`|PA7ryYR8aa	5 to be exact|`|sCHUFUXsaa	5 or 6 something like that  but i think 5.|`|dNg1iZxLaa	If he has 5, than he is tied with MJ.  And im sure he will have will get a few more!
Lol0iLfgaa	A lot of D2 and D3 schools will take walk-ons without requiring too incredible of times.  So pretty much anyone who has a passion for the sport and is reasonably good can join.    If you can run around a 4:25 mile (Guys) or a 5:35ish (Girl) (sea level), you should probably get a scholarship.  I was a 4:32 miler (At elevation) and got some scholarship money to run.  Granted, I am more of a longer distance guy, but still, coaches really just want people who are good, and are committed to the sport.    Edit:  The first guy who posted is completely clueless.  Sub-9:00 2 mile?  You would be one of the best high school distance runners in the country and could go to any school, D1, D2 or D3 with scholarship pretty easily.   Sub 4:10 mile?  Really?  In high school?  In short, you don't have to be a national champ to run in college.    Edit Again:  Go with a 5:35ish mile.  Remember to try and get into contact with any coaches of any schools that you are interested in.  Find their email on their athletic site and drop them a line.  Remember, a lot of coaches will expect you to do both Track and cross country.|`|mpYqEw2oaa	to be good, you need to run a sub 4:10 by senior year and in 800: 1:52 and in 2 mile: under 9:00|`|Taf5yWUbaa	These guys think you're talking about a guy..4:10 mile? No woman can run that. For the mile I would say about 4:40-5:10..2 mile maybe sub 10:00.|`|da6a54f61088a3e74813ed1b06d71aa5aa	To run the mile in a D2 school you are looking at 4:15 and for D3 4:25... but in all honesty, 80% of D3 schools will take you as long as you take running seriously.  Most schools have open tryouts of some sort.    If you are asking about getting a scholarship for track, you have to be in 4:15/4:25 range to any kind of money.  Track is not a big money maker for schools (especially small colleges), so there isn't as much to go around.|`|1UID5JtNaa	D1- close to or under 5 minutes  D2- 3- 5:20 or so.  I don't think there is much difference here.     4:23 for 1500 meters was the winning time at D3 last year (add about 18-20 sec for a mile)
OrFYRg27aa	The BAMFs (bad *** mother *******)  The Hardcore Hitters|`|AA10698715	THE CREW|`|gkeuj7JYaa	the firecrackers? haha i have no ideaaa =/|`|VKcHVatkaa	team for what?
a6EndAPiaa	First off to the best of my knowledge Al Davis has never had a boss as a football executive (because he has been the OWNER).    Next I will Take a guess and say Fran Tarkenton.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	Joe Willie Namath    Al Davis was on the staff of the Colts, Chargers and Raiders before becoming an owner.|`|Dw8eSSkGaa	Peyton Manning|`|XnbcCgboaa	As a general rule in football - never question Al Davis.
DSJOxz0Qaa	Freshmen year is a good time to start.  If you have talent, memorizing plays will come.  But I only played my Sr year and was offered a scholarship so it can be done.  On the plus side, you really only have so many hits in your body...starting late can be a benefit.|`|Dw8eSSkGaa	Nope vince young was the quarter back for the Tennessee volunteers and he only started in college and now he used to be in the NFL nobody really knows where he is now and whats he doing with his life.|`|jnmuzyA7aa	Yea you definitely can start. You def have the height and weight. And if you can throw a ball far you definitely can. i know as a fact cause i play football. Hope you do good man maybe ur the next thing. Anyway guy above me vince young never played for the tennessee volunteers. he played for the texas longhorns and now plays for the tennessee titans. And people knows where he is, he is just 2nd string cause he did bad in practice
e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	No...it is first come, first serve.    Log in early and go for the White Sox and Cardinals games first.  They will sell out in seconds.     Your friend is thinking about how to get the playoff tickets.|`|Mxzz2my7aa	buy season tix|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	1st come - 1st served    13 game packs are on sale now & you can get Cards tix & Sox tix in the packs.

FQ: I went to the gym to be fit for the beach, my birthday, carnaval, and to just be fit in general :P|`|3yqCKPzVaa	hahaha lolz =)))|`|wrhqkEiMaa	Gym is her codeword for pleasuring herself to some Materazzi pictures.    Wow did I just say that?    Psh oh come on, Stefy is like the youngest person here...and lets not mention her donkey escapades lol|`|FFE9Qztzaa	so true! ^|`|WS8MvKQAaa	lmfao!!!!|`|VpiYSQVnaa	about a million, but there's a rule, if they get his hair they have to style it like him too    FQ- she probably didnt even go to the gym lol    vvvv =O    Imilyia, I 2nd that motion!!|`|p1kmZziVaa	Freshy, there's kids here! Gosh.    A lot of Pirlos, we should give a Pirlo to Bella.
Mxzz2my7aa	cool thanks for sharing|`|gkSfxNQJaa	i agree with you, but they do have willits and napoli who has some potential and also howie kendrick who missed most of last year do to injury|`|4cJuKxJbaa	The Angels still play in a VERY weak division. The A's have steped up there offense but there pitching is still suspect! The Angels will still win the division...but they never did well in the playoffs anyways so who cares. They were the best team going into the playoffs last year & lost in the first round. Its all a crap shot in the playoffs anyways so they have enough to take the division so why not take a chance in the playoffs with what they got now!|`|5xIroQjMaa	The Angels are still the best team in the division, even with their losses. And many of their players had down years last year, if they turn it around, they likely won't even miss the players they lost. Still, the A's are coming on strong, and could be challengers to the Angels divisional supremacy.|`|mml9J88caa	agreed. but we will still have to wait and see. if you think about it anything can happen. look at the rays....|`|39fxsuGaaa	K-Rod will be replaced by Arredondo.  Anderson was/is over the hill.  Texeira is a loss but they only had him for less than half a season last year and were plenty good without him.|`|Vr2D39jfaa	it doesn't matter, they wouldn't do anything in the postseason anyway|`|DkwgogXZaa	I really hoped they had kept Texiera.....unfortunately, they're gonna need to make a trade or hope that Wood and they're other prospects play like Evan Longoria.....
Mn97YDIyaa	Nuggets: 3.     I only have one favorite team.     LMAO!!!!!!!!! That is the GREATEST trade I have ever seen. Good job.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	We are currently 9th in the East. But, when its all said and done I expect nothing more or less than a 6th - 8th seed.|`|o5XWImGsaa	nuggets and pistons     worst trade I have seen dawg   lol|`|hmZicrCYaa	Heck yeah pistons even though we suck this year.  Well then again its mainly Allen Iverson who doesn't belong we should've kept Billups.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	My team is currently the number 2 seed in the east|`|TNN6U75Maa	Not a playoff team atm. 3 1/2 games behind though.
5TPaYv3Vaa	heck no he wont break the record and he will 3 and that is it|`|YQLNqgnWaa	he wont, he might get 3-4 when he ends his career; its not all about scoring look at bill russell|`|Mn97YDIyaa	With Lebron James around, no.|`|GBGcI509aa	I agree with the dude above me.|`|kxMDFPnbaa	he wont break that record.. there are way too many stars that he will have to out play every year.. when he starts fading because of age how is he going to beat out a prime chris paul or any other upcoming stars|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Kobe won't his team is very well rounded, so he does no need to put on the scoring averages he had immediately post-Shaq and the fact that when the Lakers let up and are not at contender level when they age Kobe would be passed his prime and incapable of being a scoring leader.    MJ has 10 scoring titles  Iceman Gervin has 6    Current NBA players:    Allen Iverson - 4x Scoring Champion  Kobe, T-Mac, and Shaq - All tied for 2
13XU8cCKaa	Sorry bud but he will not.  He is 30.  3 rings and no finals mvp's because of Shaq.  His game will decline in the next 3 years.|`|bjnPGBZyaa	he won't ever...unless they start handing mvps to guys who come off the bench in the finals|`|DkwgogXZaa	great question...with this squad it might be 2015....|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	NEVER. Kobe Bryant does not have time to win even ONE Finals MVP. Lakers fans are too delusional to realize that because they live in Dreamland.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	never he has never have one shaq has won the ones when shaq was in the lakers|`|it2UVkF4aa	When Andrew Bynum gets back--3 months from now.|`|YQLNqgnWaa	jordan got a lot of these finals mvp when he was in his 30's, kobe can get some; i admit however at most he will get 3 finals mvps, least 1 finals mvp.

Never.|`|PcxUNztLaa	I really would'nt say that's a legit record... 1 Bill Russell won 11 NBA championships as the leader of the Celtics...BUT they did'nt have playoff MVP's .....it's safe to say that if they did , Russell would have at least 8 - 9 Finals MVP's...     2 Scottie Pippen deserved at least 2 of those MVP's.....but the Jordan Jocking Media would never allow it...too many shoes to sell.    and  3.....when will Kobe break the record????...who knows?..Kobe is still playing....remember , Michael Jordan did'nt start winning until he was 27 - 28 years old...kobe barely turned 30. and KB24 will NEVER QUIT on his team and "Lose the love for the game"...like Jordan did.|`|sCHUFUXsaa	im a kobe bryant fan..also lakers fan..    he won 3 rings already..0 finals mvps    even if he wins the finals mvp this season  he wont beat the one and only mj.

h9PVRHPWaa	Hey don`t knock knox I think he is the up incomming big man in WWE. He won`t win it. but i don`t mind seeing him with the big boys.      edit: It just depends on what happens around him. I don`t see any of the other big men being around for too much longer. I mean Taker and Kane, Show, can`t stay forever.

XQoH9ZI5aa	I know Joe Nieuwendyk won a Minto Cup before he played pro hockey (was the MVP in 1984) and I think Gary Roberts was on his team as well.     Lionel Conacher is always a good guess for anything....no he didn't.       Interesting fact.......it said the 1946 MVP of the Mann Cup was Doug Favell.....since I knew that the Flyers had a goalie in the late 1960's and early 70's by that name (but figured he would have been much too young) I checked out Favell's info......he would have been 1 year old because he was born in 1945 BUT he also played for the Philadelphia Wings as one of the players in the Original Six northern Lacrosse League which leads me to conclude that it must have been his father.       Another interesting note.....I know this just because I have a signed picture of him with all the cups together....Wendell Young is the only player to win the Memorial, Turner, Stanley and Calder cups.
6aNFkVSkaa	cold air temperature releases air out of football or basketball or volleyball ect ect ect..|`|S8DWzm6raa	i dont think its because of the cold, because the pros play in below freezing weather all the time, its probably a small hole, try using fix-a flat, its for car tires but it might work on a football.|`|ZJWJ1Q4Xaa	This could be one of two things,  1. You put a hole in the ball while playing with it and so it wouldnt keep the air.  2. or the cold air made it go flat by replacing the hot air, but this would have to be extremely cold conditions for it to do this.  I think it probably just has a hole in it.|`|AA11108627	Air is air.  Temperature would not determine whether or not your ball deflates.  The air would run out whether it was hot, cold, or anything else.    Assuming someone isn't playing a practical joke on you, the ball has a leak in it somewhere, and the air inside it is escaping.    Try this: pump the ball full of air, then hold it under water (perhaps fill up your sink).  Do you see any bubbles coming out?  That is the location of the leak.    You may be able to patch the leak.  Perhaps a sporting goods store or a local football coach could give you some advice.  However, assuming your ball is still in "like-new" condition, return it to the store you purchased it from.  You may be able to obtain a replacement.|`|C2CCbTRKaa	GET YOUR MONEY BACK,IT WAS A FAKE.KNOCKOFF BRAND.|`|AA10698715	Sounds like you have a hole in your ball.|`|Dw8eSSkGaa	It may sound weird but any ball deflates cause it can find any hole anywhere on the ball it can also go through the ball.|`|6pFGfzQdaa	You probably have a hole in the football.

They also the The National Football League champions 5 times, and won Super Bowls I and II during the 1970s.    1970s: Pittsburgh Steelers: They have 8 players on the 1970s All-Decade team, including Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn Swann, Joe Greene, and Jack Lambert.  They also won Super Bowls IX, X, XIII, and XIV during the 1970s.    1980s: San Francisco 49ers: They have 5 players and 1 coach n the National Football League 1980s All-Decade Team, including Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Roger Craig, Ronnie Lott, and coach Bill Walsh.  They also won Super Bowls XVI, XIX, XXIII, and XXIV during the 1980s.    1990s: Dallas Cowboys:  They have 5 people on the National Football League 1990s All-Decade Team, including Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, and Deion Sanders.  They also won Super Bowls XXVII,  XXVIII, and XXX during the 1990s.  (I would have put the Broncos here, but they only won 2 Super Bowls, and didn't quiet produce as many star players as the Cowboys.)    2000s:  Since there is no National Football League 2000s All-Decade Team for the 2000s, because the 2000s aren't over yet, its going to be a little harder choosing this one.   New England Patriots:  They will probably have close to 5 people in the National Football League 2000s All-Decade Team, including Tom Brady and Randy Moss.  They also won Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, and XXXIX.      Prediction for 2010s:  San Diego Chargers:  They have looked promising the last few season, and I think they will really break out in a couple of years.  Philip Rivers and Vincent Jackson will go down in history as one of the best QB-WR pairs in NFL history (not better than Montana-Rice, Moon-Carter, Bradshaw-Swann, or Brady-Moss though).  LT is one of the best RBs in NFL history and I think he will stick around for a while, to help the Chargers along.  He will probably retire in 2011 or 2012.  Shawne Merriman and Rey Maualuga (providing they draft him) will also be considered one of the best LB pairs in NFL history (again, not as good as some).  Antonio Cromartie will continue his glorious career and break the record for most INT in a season.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	60's- Packers and Bart Starr  70's- Steelers and Terry Bradshaw  80's- 49ers and Joe Montana  90's- Cowboys and Emmitt Smith  00's- Patriots and Peyton Manning|`|SLjdh5jXaa	60'S: PACKERS, AND BART STARR 70'S: STEELERS, AND CURTAINJ DEFENSE 80'S: 49ERS AND JOE MONTANA! 90'S: DALLAS AND EMMITT SMITH 00'S: SO FAR: PATRIOTS AND TOM BRADY!|`|rNUyV1EYaa	'60's- Packers    '70's- Steelers    '80's- 49ers    '90's- Cowboys    '00's- Patriots    I don't think there will ever be another dominant team of a decade.

ZzXxRLWcaa	I think its easier to tell with pitchers most times...    I mean, if someone can get out major league hitters consistently? Then he's major league ready... just look at Joba. Other then health, there's not much doubt about his abilities... its pretty clear he overmatches most hitters.    Coke showed pretty good stuff (not as good as Joba, but still...), so i think its hard to say hes overrated. You get hitters out and your rated corrrectly imo.    Kennedy and Hughes on the other hand did NOT get hitters out... so thats a clear indication also.    Of course a pitcher can always pull a Zito and inexplicably lose command and velocity, but thats unusual.    Hitters on the other hand... they need more of a chance. Every hitter has peaks and valleys, so more patience is needed before you declare someone a failure in the big leagues.    I like gardner too... if he can just hit for some average, he'd be awesome with his speed. We'll see.. give the kids a chance, we'll never know otherwise.|`|Vmkas1fLaa	yes|`|K04wa0zGaa	Coke by no means is overrated because he isn't get much attention outside of New York.The only reason these players are being hyped are because they are Yankees and the Yankees always think they have the best players. I agree that Phil Coke is a ok prospect but he is never going to put up Cy Young numbers the same goes for Brett Gardner. In fact the Yankees should just trade their prospects that can't handle the pressure of New York because they would just be hurting the potential the player possesses like Ian Kennedy who I would love to have on my team I would even trade for him and another prospect for Rick Ankiel, because the faith I have the player can succeed outside New York.|`|36zm5zK8aa	phil coke isnt overrated. melky did well when he came up, and lost of ppl (myself included) thought he was like the second coming, but yeah that hasnt been going too well, but he did put up some nice numbers in dwl. phil hughes and ian kennedy were overrated, now it seems as if ppl have given up on them.  you cant just yet, theyre still young, and hughes seems like he could do pretty well after another couple of months or another season in AAA. the yankees dont think they have to do it, they know they do. when they kept winning, they were full of grown talent, jeter, mo, posada, bernie, etc. its part of the game, getting excited about prospects. they yankees arent putting all the spotlight on them, the fans are|`|lcHzbFpXaa	yes|`|SEcM9EDZaa	No, but Coke Zero is.    Seriously, I'd never heard of the guy before your post, probably because he isn't exactly a hot prospect. 26-21 minor league record, 3.61 ERA and 1.32 WHIP.  He gave up nearly a hit per inning though his K:BB ratio was good.  Still, the guy will be 26 this season and I think you can probably expect a Rasner-like performance from him if he makes the big club.

Most likely.    Will you fall and get injured?  Maybe, but not likely.    Can you forget how to ski after a long absence from the slopes?  You will be surprised at how quickly your skills will come back to you.  Start our slow.  If you take lessons, explain your situation to your instructor.  They will then be better able to help you get back in the swing of things.    Are there exercises that can help you prepare for your trip?  Yes, but forget about the fancy ski exercise routines, just try to get in shape.     I used to ski on high school trips and college trips, but then stopped skiing for about 15 years.  I went on my first ski trip after the break two years ago.  The skis changed, the boots changed, the clothing changed, but the basics of skiing did not.  Within a day or two, I felt like I was back to the level I was at the last time I went skiing (greens and blues).    Start playing down your skills prior to your trip.  Jokingly tell everyone that you hope you did not forget how to ski after so long of an absence.  Then if you DO bust your butt, everyone will blame it on the absence.  If you pick it up quickly, everyone will just think you were being modest.  If you say nothing and let them think you are a good skier and THEN bust your butt, you will look like a fool.

350bcdf4eeecdbb6c2c782450ef74b6baa	listed in priorities  1) LEARN TO SCRUM. this is actually sooo important, cause you're pushing the front rows ! the position is a bit tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it then it's easyy .    2) lift , or be lifted. this is depending on your team, i knew that i just lifted cause i wasn't very good at being lifted (typically, second rows are lifted)    3) tacking , rucking , etc. etc. etc. just the usual stuff everyone should know.    so basically : focus on YOUR role in scrumming !|`|Efns7sDLaa	Ex-Second Row turned Loosehead Prop.

This means you have to be a powerhouse with the calfs and thighs. 2) Lifting/Getting lifted in the lineouts. Says it itself. Need to be able to lift. 3) Tackling. As one of the fitter forwards you must be able to be up after a scrum and straight to the challenge. Second Rows and Flankers are instrumental in tackling. 4) Running. My weak point. You need to be fast, nimble and strong. A difficult trio. Hope I helped.|`|nVDlTlomaa	i think you want match-day skills and where to focus your training, right?  assuming you're a novice who is playing lock due to body type, i believe building 80-minute fitness and becoming effective at phase-2 play should be your main goals.  thirdly, take a referees clinic or 2 to learn the laws well, and fourthly, don't miss your practices during the week - you'll get scrum and line-out form that you can't build alone.  To gain 80-minute fitness, add 1-2 long running workouts to your week with bursts of speed built-in; and play the B and C-side matches from any forward position.  Your stamina improves the level of your side:  your quick move out of the scrum forces 1-2 loose forwards and the other lock to take a few energetic strides toward the loose (maybe very valuable on a novice side). effective phase-2 play means something different at each level - i believe i stood out as a novice because i kept my eyes open in all rucks and mauls, looking to take and give a clean ball out to the back line.  or grab another big-boy and take the ball for a run straight upfield - rucking and rolling!  have fun.
H5FE4xZxaa	It is the position they play, libero.  They are basically the specialized defensive and do most of the passing. They are required to wear a different color jersey so they can be tracked for substitutions and such.|`|e9zopZE0aa	this person is a libero.  they are usually middle back row.  they specialize in passing and are usually shorter than the other players.  they can also subsitute in or out without checking in with the table.|`|WLbz101yaa	The libero  they can only play back row and can go in for one than one person in a game.  they cannot serve in club, but they can in school volleyball.  They are leaders in making the defensive plays and saves.|`|3cR5oPcFaa	thats the libero theyre the main defensive specialist    they wear the different color jersey so they dont have to wait for the ref to sub them in they can just run on the court in place of someone else|`|UXTf8LUaaa	It's the libero.  This is a player who specializes in the defensive part of the game. The purpose of wearing a different color is for the judges to distinguish him when he enters to the court. He can enter and exit the court at any moment without asking for substitution like any other player has to do. They can substitute any player who is the back row of the court and cannot play i  the front row as hitters do. Some American leagues have the liberos doing the service but the International Tournaments and leagues do not permit it. They may have freedom in their way through the court but they have many limitations when they are inside the court. They cannot set for any hitters doing volley, they have to do it with a bump. If the libero still does the set in volley the hitter is forced to attack without jumping. Like I said, the libero can't serve and cannot take offensive positions and attack jumping.|`|VIqVwBVMaa	That person is a libero, They can only play back row and when they come in it doesn't count as a substitution.

Then Randy Orton won the Royal Rumble. Also Edge won the WWE championship due to Matt Hardy hitting Jeff with a chair.

So after Orton punted Mr.McMahon he and shane started a rivalry. Due to the rivalry Orton challenged Shane a No Holds Barred Match at WWE No Way Out. Also HBK is doing a poor performance against JBL.

Ek1x32WHaa	50% Good.    Gordon, Logano, Ragan all should make the chase.|`|E5mFWOqqaa	pretty bad, actually.    Gordon's a great, consistent driver. Ragan is a pretty good driver, too. I really want to see him win in 2009.    Joey Logano and Scott Speed are rookies. Dale Jarrett isn't racing at all anymore. Dave Blaney is with a startup team that isn't guaranteed to even be in a single race.     Overall, you're hoping for a lot of luck to get much out of that team.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Dlae Jarrett is retired, he won't get you any points this year.  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|fdgslflIaa	That's a pretty bad team. Speed and Blaney aren't that great of drivers, Jarret is retired, Regan i've found to be an average driver, and Gordon is on a decline. Logano is probably your best driver since he took Tony Stewart's old car.|`|OdUZRBRtaa	goood just I dont think they count anouncers (Dale Jarret retired) and Dave Blaney isn't very good but youve got a pretty decent team.
AA10640608	I grew up in France and hated the strikes. Paris was paralyzed and I would have to walk miles to work while the Metro drivers, taxi drivers, & bus drivers sat in bars drinking Anisette or Stella Artois!!|`|GutYNu9baa	All for it, they have a very valid point.|`|Jqlfj74Oaa	useless,       the french give up too easily...|`|7d0249cf69b3d930b0e5e2badb759bcaaa	I think it is ok to strike as they have a clear reason and point for it. It would be useless if the strike was pointless, if u get what I mean. I think it's OK
xKXu0Qb2aa	I know , They Couldn't even keep it called the "Throwback" for a Week.  It's been Changed Twice now in less than 3 weeks.    But , at Least "Attitude Adjuster" sounds better than "Throwback" for a Finisher.    Was I mistaken , or did I hear Michael/King Slip & call it the STFU on RAW last night?  I swear one of those two slipped & said STFU.    He should Just call it the "WTF".  That be even Better.....|`|nzKo4TFvaa	WWE SUX TNA RULES|`|AA11482019	Who cares about the FU?  It's lame no matter what it's called.    As for the STF, that's the real name of the hold.  STF stands for Stepover Toehold Facelock. It has been used for years, long before Cena started using it.|`|iOICjcZcaa	What's your point? Big deal.       Is there an actual wrestling question here?      ....Didn't think so.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Hmm...    Who cares what a finishing maneuver is called?|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Yes,and.......we have all realized that.Question?|`|7Rj306Xtaa	Yeah...I think you just answered your own question... :)|`|01X6Y0Byaa	LOL all part of the kid evolution for 6 year olds|`|R4au9H2maa	its not wtf its oh barnicles  get with the pg rating jeez      just kidding obviously, yes its pretty stupid but its not a big deal. I was more mad about Jericho tapping to Cena in 3 seconds and Cena not tapping to Jericho after like 30 seconds
xZJZNpIlaa	ehh in a way    differences  hockey uses a puck not a ball  hockey is on skates  lacrosse has nets on their sticks while hockey has blades  different kinds of penaltys and stop of the clock  different number of players out on the field/rink    similarities  the objects of the games which is to score on the oppenents net/goal  hitting(boys)  same kinds of positions. defense(longpole) forward(shortpole) and goalie        hope this helped  good luckk|`|YPfiWhNdaa	They certainly are.  Both require incredible fitness and are so fast!  Balance, a wide range of vision, ability to see a play unfolding before/as it happens, the ability to work as a team to attack and defend.|`|VjAoRpIhaa	kind of, but hockey is better|`|ll2y4YIGaa	yes, i would say they are similar in many ways|`|GPeXvcdOaa	they are kinda alike i mean they both use balls/pucks and have nets to score a goal but lacrosse is like a net and u have to keep the ball in it and u have to use the net thing the whole time even when u throw

wxXguyK3aa	I'm a Giants fan, and I like the Yankees.|`|X7O0Uxqxaa	They are Brett Favre fans.|`|VH1ze729aa	Yankees all the way :)|`|r4J2sPHzaa	im not  jets fan im a giants fan and im a yankees fan|`|AXoEgmnSaa	Yankee fan|`|YTasscmKaa	Yankees. Its fun because I can get all the hate for rooting for the Yankees because they always win and all the hate for rooting for the Jets because they always lose.|`|p0humGlPaa	nope|`|aFGbh9FAaa	Yankees|`|9Vrrj0otaa	Yankees
os2bxCVyaa	I reccommend a Top Flight, if you cant get much spin, dont get a Pro V 1, get a harder ball instead.     I am a 27 handicap, so we are the same standard.    Good Luck,|`|kGCsDFjwaa	You would be best using white ones with dimples.  Honestly if you are 28 handicapp you will not notice the difference in using any ball.When you get your handicapp into single figures, then start to think about different balls.|`|exIBZGF6aa	If you're a 28, I'd spend the extra money on lessons rather than worrying about which golf ball to play. Don't take this as a negative response; a ball will benefit your game, but not nearly as much as lessons.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	Try these:    Top Flite Freak  TaylorMade Burner  Srixon TriSpeed, Soft Feel, or AD333  Precept Distance IQ180  Nike Juice 312, Karma, PD Soft, Straight, or Long  Callaway HX Pearl or Hot  Bridgestone e6+  Pinnacle Platinum Distance or Gold FX Long  Titleist Pro V1, V1x, NXT Tour, NXT Extreme, DT Carry or Roll|`|PRx6j6YQaa	i also have a high handicap i look for golf balls that float and do not travel that far so i dont have to go to deep in the woods to find it|`|def8SxE2aa	Try different golf balls and buy the ones that feel and perform the best. A good test is to chip, pitch, and putt with different golf balls and find which one feels the best and checks (spins) the most. So try a variety of balls and buy the one that works the best for you.|`|wgWbm2zUaa	I agree, the best way to find a golf ball for your swing is to try them.  However, it would be expensive to buy every two piece ball in the store.  What I like to do every now and then is buy a mix of used practice golf balls on Ebay.  Tons of sellers list boxes of ball with all types of golf balls in them.  I try to win them at about 25 cents a ball or less with shipping included but have paid more for better brands (I have won several auctions for 11 cents a ball that included top named brands because they ended late a night).  I personally like to find balls that have a clear coating on the outside.     Find out what your swing speed is, it will help you select the correct ball for your swing.  Go to a sporting goods store where you can try out different clubs.  Most places show your swing speed while you are testing them. "Keep in mind that it is usually best for someone with a slower swing speed to use a softer ball. This is because softer balls are easier to compress, providing more distance. If you are using a low compression ball with a fast swing speed then you will lose distance because you are losing energy that could be transferred into the ball."
wvJmLgKxaa	Either call up the binding company or go to your local shop. They are called "baseplates" and you can get them pretty easily.|`|3eKaATFtaa	Go to a local snowboard shop    they should be able to fix it
