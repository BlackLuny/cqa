XDnjOThyaa	yep|`|XXm2yCHiaa	yes.|`|1jGEeMDYaa	My children just tried it this week for the first time, and they like it very well.  I am in USA, in Pennsylvania, so sugar cane doesn't grow here.  However I have an Aunt (my mother's sister) and her husband, who live in southern, Florida where it does grow, and they sent us some.|`|mhwCzSYJaa	Never had it, but I'd try it.|`|PbFmWqzoaa	Oh yes! I love it! I live in Singapore. It's a common drink here.|`|zXwjUdMwaa	i  like  them|`|YH3ijHncaa	no
hIqCpiXKaa	I cant tell you the exact age (because you would have to ask them). But for legal purposes you have to be at least over 18. They probably only hire over 21. You can work at walmart, target, grocery stores, ect. Sounds kinda stinky next to planet tan, but times are tough and people take the good jobs first. You just need to get some experience, you dont need to be picky. Best of Luck!

AA11447210	Typically, any supermarket will honor them unless you are using coupons that are designated for a particular store.    Often there are enough coupons in the Sunday paper that their use will easily pay for the price of the newspaper, and then some.    I clip coupons weekly also, although many expire before I can use them.|`|AA11622701	Depends on the coupons.  Some will be from the manufacturer, and can be used at any grocery stores.  Others will be specific to one store as a way to lure you in.     Also check your area stores.  You may find one that offers double coupons (they deduct twice the value of the coupon) or that will honor other store's coupons (if they carry the item).  You need to do a little looking.    Also ask around your friends.  You may be surprised how many "coupons groups" there are, where people get together and trade/give away any coupons the can not use.  You will be surprised how much you can really save doing the coupons.    Plus expired coupons can still be used by anyone who is in the military or the family of a person overseas in the military for 6 months beyond their expiration date.  One of the groups I use (yes, I am a guy and I do the grocery shopping and cooking) collects expired coupons and once a month sends them to the local VFW, which is able to get them into the hands of military families.

AA11032982	it's first necessary to lease a building of somesort, then make sure you have enough money to support it andbuy all your materials.  I believe you can get a loan for starting your own business|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	First you need to figure out what kind of store you want to create. You need to find a building,buy/lease it, got to the courts and file paperwork.

a1b7e7748fe864b4bfe2e265ef2514c6aa	Try Maccas, pizza hut or similar, a chicken place such as red rooster or kentucky ducky (KFC) or subway or any fast food place - or you could try you local supermarket to see if they accept 14 yr olds - if you are nice and strong you could even retrieve trolleys   Another thought is delivering junk mail or paper deliveries   You could also try a local business where someone is needed to sweep floors and restock and tidy up such as a trade type business   Hope these ideas help   Good luck with your new job wherever it may be|`|xh5EuJlbaa	In a mine.
