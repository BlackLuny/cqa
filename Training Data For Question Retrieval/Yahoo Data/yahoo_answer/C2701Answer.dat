"Tras estudiar los casos, logramos diferenciar ciertos tipos de aves. Existen diferencias notables entre ellas" agregó. <br>  <br>  En su estudio, el científico concluyó que los cuervos y otras aves de su misma familia, los córvidos, son los más inteligentes de la clase de las aves , seguidos por los halcones, las águilas, las garzas y los pájaros carpinteros. <br>  <br>  Como muestra de la inteligencia de los cuervos, Lefebvre contó que durante la lucha contra la segregación racial en Rhodesia (1965-1980), actual Zimbabwe, un soldado observó cómo un grupo de estas aves se posaban en los alambres de púa, cercanos a minas terrestres, para esperar a que animales caminaran por la zona minada, y una vez muertos, les sirvieran de alimento.|`|15687a3aecf5d6f77cc8e556265cd851aa	Los cuervos.

Each year in the spring, where I live, they have special training to teach dogs not to go near snakes.  So ask your vet or local pet store who in your area does this training.

wPD5lFCbaa	You really need to do the honorable thing and call your county extension service or a wild life refuge. I had the cutest little baby bunny once that I had found. Buster ate well for me but my native American Indian told me that he deserves freedom. That if I continued to care for it then it would loose it's fear of natural predators and not be able to live on its own. She also talked to me about her belief in animal spirits and made me feel so guilty. I kept it a few more days and then gave it to a wild life refuge that the county extension service directed me to. They waited till Buster was big enough to release and called me so I could come watch. It was so sweet cause they released it near a bunny clutch. It took him a while to find his way to them but I sat and watched a while, before I knew it I could not tell which one he was. It was great!|`|754bd6b84d968f8022ac25421d9a5394aa	They love unsalted peanuts, bread. Just be careful, wild squirrels have lots of germs.

It's seen most in puppies. Foxes in the East have sarcoptes, and dogs of any age who share territory with foxes tend to get it.  It attacks the ears, legs and belly most, and is extremely itchy.  Demodex normally lives on the skin, and usually shows up as patchy hair loss. It sometimes isn't itchy at all unless there is a secondary infection.   Good Luck!!|`|AA10329991	Rub used motor oil on the mangy areas; it will go away. It works; seen it done before.|`|AA11757365	There are 3 types of mange; Demodectic, Cheyletiella and Sarcoptic. Most dogs have Demodectic mange, but it lies dormant and doesn't bother the dog. This type of mange is NOT contagious. Cheyletiella is contagious to other dogs, but is short lived. Sarcoptic mange is the worse, it is highly congious to both pets AND humans (also known as scabies). They can all be treated. Once treated, it shouldn't come back  but you have to follow the Vet's treatment plan and wash EVERYTHING in your house. Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|eipDfitCaa	i had a pug w/ demodectic mange. it went away for good, but it is genetically inherited trait for the weakness to it.  if the pup has a heath guarantee, id get some money back. vets will recommend spay or neuter.

It is used to fight away bears in the mountains long time ago. The Great Pyrenees is a capable and imposing guardian, devoted to its family, and somewhat wary of strangers - human or canine. They are often used to guard livestock. When not provoked, it is calm, well- mannered, and somewhat serious. Courageous, very loyal and obedient. Gentle and affectionate with those he loves. Devoted to family even if self-sacrifice is required. It is very gentle with its family and children. It does best with children when it is raised with them from puppyhood.

IJqH0xPqaa	The normal reaction to vaccinations is no reaction whatsoever.  Your puppy is showing signs of a reaction to the vaccinations.  If 4 actual shots were given, no wonder.  There are  4 and 5 way vaccines in a single dose.  Giving 4 injections is likely the cause, and I am wondering why your vet did this.<br>  <br>  There are some vaccination manufacturers that have had a higher rate of reaction than the norms.  Fort Dodge brand is the most common to have reactions ranging from topical inflammation to death.  After discussing reactions with my veterinarian, he admitted that off the record the Pfizer brand has had the fewest reactions and appears to be more stabile than Fort Dodge.  Since I have always given my own shots and purchased vaccines from another source, my vet had nothing to gain from his advice.  I have since used Pfizer 5 way vaccines for 13 years without any reactions.<br>  <br>  To be safe, bring your dog back to the vet so he can see the reaction.  He should not use the same protocol for the next series of shots 3 weeks from now.|`|gDTNrBitaa	Hi I am new to this so bare with me, yes, it is normal just as if when a human being gets needles but if it last to long you should seek a vets opinion. I have read different things lately on shots on the internet because i have two new kittens and i have decided where they are indoor kittens i am not having them get any shots, i feel it is for the best. you can look it up under puppy vaccinations.|`|LFJsTyrTaa	yeah...i think so..but just to make sure go to the vet to see if it normal...some other reactions would probably be crying..and..like you said when you touch the spot they cry...so don't touch the swollen area anymore...<br>  <br>  ?stephie...good luck|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	yes this can happen to some dogs.    i would call the vet office in the morning and talk to the vet about.|`|8tktspK5aa	my vet said to give a baby aspirin.<br>  thats what we do and mine are little 5 pound chihuahuas.<br>  best of luck|`|eM41SbGraa	Absolutely normal! You definitely know that your dog did indeed receive its vaccination. The shot is given just under the skin and takes a fair amount of time to be absorbed.He is also probably a bit sore in the area as cells move in to fight off all of the "germs" that were in the vaccine so the area is inflammed. Keep in mind that a vaccine is inactivated or killed virus and it shows up just like a harmful virus to the body; therefore, the body reacts the exact same as it would to a real threat.  Your puppy may also have a slight fever which is also a sign that he is developing immunity. Signs that should alarm you include swelling of the face and vomiting. If that should happen, call the vet ASAP as it is a sign of an allergic reaction.|`|s8N6GsBeaa	I have never heard of four shots at once.  The one set of shots is like for 4 things but they have it in one shot.  The only other shot given with that is the rabies shot.  That is only 2 at one time.  I would question why the vet gave four.  that dont sound normal and it could be why its red and swollen.  Why would they give all 4 at the same spot too.  I would watch it and if it dont get better within 24 hours take it a vet and maybe not the one who gave the shots in the first place.  Usually they will be a little tender if you touch or pick them up near the spot and they can run a low grade fever.  Mostly they will sometimes lay around for that day.  Thats all I ever heard of.  Check with other vets why they gave 4 at once.  I had 3 dogs and have never had any get that many shots at once.

167bfc46c5befa6949975758b58fee41aa	'Stef' there is a pet kind of hedgehog called 'African Pygmy hedgehog' - they would die in the wild as it is far too cold for them.<br>  <br>  It is best to ask the breeder as if you change the food from what it is on now it may upset its stomach. I fed mine eukanuba dry cat food but now it seems most stores have stopped selling this. <br>  <br>  Yes hedgehogs are very popular as pets and many people do not realise this. They are not often seen in petstores I guess so most people are not aware that they are bred and kept. <br>  <br>  Your hedgehog will also need mealworms. Crickets are also a possibility but I never fed Oscar that because he did not live in a tank so they would jump out and escape. <br>  <br>  They cost a lot to buy (around ￡100) but are very cheap to look after compared to most other pets. The essentials are a wheel, food bowl, water bowl and a bed. My hedgie was kept on fleece bedding. I never heated Oscar's cage but he lived in my bedroom. <br>  <br>  Oscar was very friendly but I know that not all hedgies are. He never rolled in to a ball or stood his spines on end. He was really good coming out of the cage and would enjoy running about the house. Make sure they are selling you a tame one otherwise you won't be able to handle it without wearing gloves!<br>  <br>  He died of unknown causes even though I took him to the vet. Make sure you live near a breeder or vet that knows a thing or two about illnesses and treatment because this is where I went wrong. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|459e58439c42afa4d56cadfad4b6e9c5aa	I would love getting a baby hedgehog as a pet.<br>  I find them absolutely gorgeous!<br>  But it's not possible in my country.<br>  <br>  I do not have the answer but I feel kinda excited for you.<br>  Take good care of ya adorable pet.|`|O6EMwFJYaa	I have never heard the miniature ones before.<br>  But as for getting them while they are young to make them handle able. We often find them wandering up the street (in the UK) where they may get injured we usually take them off the street feed them and put the out in the garden which faces onto a field.<br>  Within 5 minutes they will uncurl and eat cat food while surrounded by fascinated cats. and when we pick them up to put them out they don't curl up again so they are very docile and bold.|`|Oa7l8xnNaa	A friend of mine got me a miniture australian hedgehog. It was a great pet, I had him for 4 ears, they usually live up to seven years i think. I kept him in an aqaurium with wood savings on the botttom and a little box for him to hide in. I fed him dried cat food and a little fruit for treats. If you get them young you can get them used to be handled. I wore gloves when i held him because the spines can get a little rough on the hands. <br>  As far as the temp, I never used a heater of any kind since my home was at a normal temp at all times. When it was nice outside I would let him roam around the yard for a while. My dog would try to grab him but he would roll up in a ball and the dog didn't like getting a mouth full of spines.<br>  I would try to find a breeder to get one, I haven't seen one in a pet store at least in my area where I live.|`|df20d3a6d6c08c5586de93ce578b7f8eaa	Ideally your hedgehog should be free. it may have been taken out of the wild.

2xRMYebnaa	Kennel Cough is usually self-limiting (goes away by itself), but there are other factors that may make it more dangerous: for example, it is more severe in puppies and elderly dogs, and there are several different viruses and bacteria that can all cause this disease- some are more resistant than others.<br>  <br>  It is always best to have the dog checked out by a veterinarian to ensure that it IS kennel cough, and not something more serious that will require treatment, and to make sure the dog is strong enough to fight off the infection.<br>  <br>  -RVT<br>  (Registered Veterinary Technician)|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	it might cause other problems if not treated.  as to killing the dog as your vet.|`|td6y2cYVaa	i don't think kennel cough alone will kill a dog (its like a doggy flu) but if not treated it will make your dog more susceptible to other diseases and that might kill your dog....|`|w9ccMFDEaa	I dont think so|`|zi7dkNjQaa	No, kennel cough will not kill your dog.  However, it is very contagious to other dogs.  It is basically "doggie flu" and a vet can prescribe antibiotics to help him get over it.  If left untreated, you will have a very unhappy doggie on your hands who may stop eating if he feels to bad and that can cause other problems.  He may also become ill with other problems while his immune system is decreased.

There are pet drinking fountains that are made to keep the water fresh and aerated and moving. I think I would recommend the ones where the water comes out of the top  they do cost a bit, but having a water supply that appeals to your cat may save some money at the vet's later on - UTIs sometimes result from chronic dehydration. cats were originally a desert species, and developed to obtain most of their required liquids through the prey animals they ate, so their thirst instinct is not always well-developed.  few cats who eat mostly or solely dry food get enough water just by drinking.    so it is worth it to do whatever you can to encourage it.  Here is a link to an example of one, I'm not affiliated with the site or or company, it's just the first hit that had the right picture: <a href="http://www.smarthome.com/6101d.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smarthome.com/6101d.html</a>|`|AA12198922	I dont think shes crazy if i told you about my three and the things they do i wouldnt have any room to answer you...<br>  it may be that the water isnt cool enough isnt fresh enough or she may just like using the tap better.   try putting the dish up on the counter with the sink it may be that she just enjoys being on top of the counter.   you may also want to try putting a mug out on the same counter my friends cat has his very own cup on the coffee talble because he likes to feel  like hes a human and everyone else get to drink out there so he should too.   you may want to try a different kind of dish like the water cooler ones that refill  good luck.|`|GS6CycBUaa	some cats dont like the smell of cartain bowls. so give her a different bowl. my cat used to refuse to drink from his plastic bowl. he would drink the rain water off the slide! so i gave him a glass bowl and now hes fine.|`|a13f664b3a8df89eff05158f43885f6baa	Yeah, my cat is like that too.

wU9Sd6qFaa	Yo estoy embarazada de ocho meses y vivo desde hace dos a?os con dos gatos persas (gato y gata). Ahora se ha puesto de moda la obsesion de la toxoplasmosis que es una enfermedad transmitida por las heces de los gatos pero también por carne poco cocinada o cruda y verdura mal lavada. Si tus gatos no tienen esta enfermedad (yo les hice un analisis) no te la pueden transmitir. En mi caso como no salen de casa ni comen carne cruda no pueden contagiarse por lo que yo estoy segura. Lo unico intenta no ser tu la que recoga sus caquitas pero con eso basta, yo les sigo dando besazos y no pasa nada. En el embarazo te preocupas por muchas cosas porque quieres que todo vaya bien pero hay personas que se pasan tres pueblos y encima por ignorancia.

655e207d8e6798c43fcd255cdb8b49d0aa	The dog is 2 and nobody noticed this before?  What about shots?  Usually in a routine physical the vet notices this little (or not so little) detail.  I have a male shepherd that had the same problem, but I was told when he was a baby; however by 6-8 weeks on another trip to the vet both were in place.  He was a resuce I found out about - I took him in at 3 weeks because his mother stopped producing milk, and although I breed shepherds I've never had another one that had the issue, although I've heard of it before and I don't think it's uncommon, it can happen with any breed.  I'm thinking by 2 though the chances of both falling into place won't happen; and castration will be very expensive because now they have to go inside.  Definitely bad luck!|`|ZSesESvOaa	that was how I got my GSD but the breeder told me he said wait a few months and it might drop but it didn't and we were going to have him fixed anyway but it did cost extra. I have had a lot of other health problems with this dog and now at almost six he is not given long to live.<br>  I had never heard of it before and have not heard of it since until I saw you question so I am not to sure that it doesn't just happen on occasion. If you have not had a lot of other problems with you dog it just might be a fluke for this breeder. We got our pup a little older than most so that may be why he knew|`|kEZuHFOjaa	Yes you want to tell the breeder.My parents had a cocker spaniel with this problem. Was from champion bloodlines too.They did not wish to breed him however and decided to have him neutered, and I'm not really sure how true this is but our vet at the time told us that since he only had one testicle he could not sire puppies and did not produce the testosterone so he would have no behavioural or health problems.Well he never did sire any or try to for that matter and we had females.He never did show any signs of aggressiveness and was an all around sweet dog.I can't tell you about health problems he lived to be 8 years old in great health (until the neighbors fed him a hot dog stuffed with rat poison, autopsy was done)You may want to have this reconfirmed but if it is true, then I don't see paying that much for fixing.And yes I'm very much for people getting their pets fixed and being responsible.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	yes let his breed know that he had this problem.     they can sire litters with only one testicle down.       tell this other person that you dog had this problem and have them check there dog.    the problem can be paste on to there young.|`|C0CM03uyaa	As others have mentioned this is not uncommon. You can let the breeder know but it is not her fault and she should not be held responsible for the bill if that is what you are getting at? <br>   It IS a genetic thing and just because your dog has this does not mean that she has seen it before or that she should even change her breeding over it. When you breed dogs you are dealing with thousands and thousands of genes and every single breeding is a gamble that something will happen that is less then desirable. This dog is being taken out of the gene pool as most with one testie are and that is all you can do.<br>   As for it costing 5 times more then a regular neuter... Find another vet! That is ridiculous. I had a pup once with this and called to ask about it before I placed him in a pet home to find out how much more it would cost and my vet said generally 40 to 65 dollars more. My pups testicle ended up dropping at 4 months of age but anyway... it also doesn't matter how long it has been up there.. it should not cost you 5 times more.<br>   By all means let your breeder know but as I said.. you can not blame her for this unless she was knowingly breeding dogs whohad this issue. He could very likely be the only one she has ever produced and may not ever see it again. That's just how it goes!<br>   How does a person go 2 years with out realizing their dog only has one testie? :)|`|gtGBtfTUaa	This is called monorchid. Many males can still sire puppies with only one testicle. But this is something that the Breeder had to be aware of in her line. It is usually inherited.<br>  <br>  Yes, it does cost more, and if it is not taking care of it can cause a lot of other health issues and can even develop into cancer.<br>  <br>  This should have been caught sooner. Did you have him to a vet for his puppy shots and 1 year check-up? It should have been noticed during one of these visits and the Vet should have advised you to keep an eye on it.<br>  <br>  I know that this is not something that most people think that they should check on, but a Vet should check all male dogs testicles when they go in for a visit. This is part of their job.|`|AA11593573	Hello - <br>  I am a breeder of Jack Russell Terriers and you should absolutely tell your breeder about the undescended testicle. <br>  I don't understand why your vet just found it now after 2 years as this is something that can be felt at just 6 weeks of age. <br>  Most testicles that are undescended do come down eventually but some don't.  The ones that do not come down should be removed because they can become cancerous. <br>  You say your dog has been healthy and hasn't ever needed veterinary treatment - but part of standard veterinary care would be a physical where they could have found this at a much earlier time.  If your breeder took the pups to the vet for first vaccinations and puppy exam they would have told her about the condition. Did she keep this information from you? <br>  I had one puppy with an undescended testicle that was found on 7 week exam and informed my buyer immediately. Your breeder could have taken some money off the purchase of your puppy or let you pick another one. <br>  One last question/comment. Did your vet take an xray or ultrasound to confirm this undescended testicle? Sometimes dogs are born with only one and do just fine. <br>  Lastly, I don't know where you live but there are veterinary hospitals who participate in low cost spay/neuter programs as a collaborative effort to control overpopulation of dogs and cats. Here is the Spay USA website link that will direct you to a veterinarian in your area that offers low and sometimes free spay/neuter services.  GOOD LUCK<br>  <a href="http://www.spayusa.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spayusa.org/</a>|`|GJ00A9S3aa	I hope it will be ok.|`|qSBmTZu2aa	There is no guarantee on testicles, my dog and some of his siblings had the same problem.  You unfortunately get it fixed and pay the bill.  I wouldn't recommend paying extra for any incisions that weren't necessary like I did.
x0TnhGMUaa	Sudden shivering is a fear response in dogs.  Maybe she was sprayed by a similar hose attachment at an earlier time.  She is clearly terrified of it.<br>  <br>  This doesn't necessarily mean that she was abused though.  Many pet training manuals instruct owners to use a water gun or hose as a deterrent for unwanted behaviour.  <br>  <br>  Just love her lots, and she'll get over it, for now it is simply a conditioned response.|`|b5COxaclaa	It sounds to me like a phobia of the hose. DO NOT coddle her for acting afraid, in doing so you are not comforting her but reinforcing her fear of the hose. I would let her skip a meal and then put her bowl with something REALLY yummy in it on the hose. Put her on a leash and sit on the ground near the hose. Act like the hose isnt even there and like you cant imagine why she isnt gobbling up those goodies! point to the goodies (not the hose) and say in a happy voice "get it" "get those cookies" etc. worked for a friends puppy who was terrified of garbage cans :)|`|mqQLk7lJaa	you have to start out slow. put some food or a treat next to the hose attachment. if things go okay then start to make the dog sitwith you while you hold the thing. then move to watering your plants while the dog is there. slowly make her spend more and more time around you and the hose attachment and she should get over it in a few months.<br>  P.S. it might not be a good idea to bath her with it just yet. :)<br>  good luck.

0WyITp7zaa	I think that your pup is just being stubborn. Do you free-feed him? If so, don't leave the bowl of food down anymore for him to eat whenever he wants. Have set times for him to eat. Give him about 10 minutes to eat his meal. If he doesn't eat and insists on eating other food, pick up his food and don't feed him until the next meal. I know this sounds really cruel, but he's learning that if he refuses to eat his own food, you'll give him something he wants. I don't think he'll starve himself though, so sooner or later he will eat. If you think it's a medical problem, take him to a vet to have tests done. Good luck with him.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	just put the food you want him to eat down at each feeding  which should be once in the morning and once in the evening.

Le Collectif pour la Libération Animale Montpellier s’est formé au début de l’année 2006 autour d’une femme, Dominique, convaincue de la nécessité d’informer les gens sur le sort des animaux. Déterminée, elle a commencé seule avec une table d’information de temps en temps au Triangle, important lieu de passage de la ville, entre le centre commercial Polygone et la place de la Comédie. D’autres l’ont rejoint et un petit collectif a pris forme petit à petit.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ce n’est pas une association en tant que telle, ce sont simplement des personnes qui ont envie d’agir parce qu’elles trouvent révoltante la manière dont sont traités les animaux : corridas, vivisection, fourrure, sort des animaux de ferme, cirques, tous les aspects de la protection animale sont abordés.<br>  Sur leur stand, des informations, des pétitions, des tracts sans oublier un grand panneau qu’ils ont baptisé le mur de la honte sur lequel ils ont collé des photos destinées à interpeller les passants. Les réactions sont diverses. Il y a les je m’en foutistes qui passent leur chemin sans un regard, les convaincus, qui s’arrêtent signer les pétitions, et les indécis mais curieux qui viennent se renseigner. ? Lorsque nous leur montrons les conditions sordides qui règnent dans les élevages industriels ou la manière dont sont tués les animaux élevés pour la fourrure, beaucoup de gens se montrent sensibles. Ils semblent prendre conscience d’une autre réalité différente de celle dans laquelle ils vivent ? analyse Dominique.<br>  Mais la tache de ces militants est loin d’être simple. ? Notre discours remet en cause des modes de fonctionnement inscrits profondément dans la société ainsi que des pouvoirs établis ? estime-t-elle. Elle n’attend donc pas des résultats immédiats de ses actions. ? Nous effectuons un travail de fond, le cheminement doit se faire dans les esprits pour qu’il y ait un changement véritable?. Il y a toutefois une manière assez efficace de susciter l’intérêt d’après son expérience. ? Leur parler de leur santé, leur dire que les antibiotiques ou la mauvaise nourriture ingurgités par les animaux d’élevage se retrouvent dans l’eau et dans leurs assiettes, que les cosmétiques contiennent des produits toxiques et qu’il vaut mieux choisir des marques qui non seulement n’utilisent que des produits inoffensifs mais qui en plus ne sont pas testées sur les animaux ?.<br>   <br>  Dominique est venue à la protection animaux<br>  <br>  Contact : clam34@gmail.com|`|Ne7FN0lMaa	il existe pleins d'associations  pour la protection des animaux autre que la S.P.A.<br>  commencer a trouver la plus proche de votre habitation et le mieux serait ,d'y aller sur place pour avoir tous les renseignements<br>  moi meme,j'ai adoptée un caniche,il y a moins d'un mois dans une association qui se trouve à paris 12è<br>  je trouve votre geste formidable!!!!!!!|`|c8sHelieaa	Appelle les refuges près de chez toi, ils ont souvent besoin de monde pour les aider.<br>  En tout cas bravo pour ton initiative !|`|d0fb1a9d0080fb70538b8867a9f51f2baa	va sur le site 30 Millions d'amis

UlMsInMqaa	If he has been swimming it could be water in his ears. It could be a yeast infection especially if he is a drop ear breed and it has been humid. He could have ear mites or something like a bug in his ear, grass seed or a foxtail in it. Foxtails are deadly if not removed. They are inhaled or swallowed or even stuck in coats and commenly picked up in the feet but are barbed one direction. Once they enter they can not back out but can penetrate internal organs. <a href="http://www.leerburg.com/foxtail.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.leerburg.com/foxtail.htm</a> shows what $3500 worth of damage looks like from a foxtail. He was lucky the dog did live.<br>  <br>  I would see a vet and have his ears checked, the other poster is right about shaking also producing a aural hematoma.|`|trVQ3Ld1aa	If it's a new thing and he seems to be doing it often get him to the vet. It is likely an ear infection. If your dog has floppy ears and he does too much shaking he could end up with an aural hematoma. Good luck!|`|2vi95cLDaa	He could have ear wax build-up??

5db14b93b6f8b7df5274c10511ae863baa	don't mix birds. keep them in seperate cages unless they were raised together. <br>  <br>  however - the yellow one may not be fighting, you will know fighting. screams, feather loss and blood. the other one might be preening the grey one as a courtship behavior. if the grey one isn't bothered by it, then it shouldn't be a problem. <br>  <br>  the yellow one doesn't understand punishment. <br>  <br>  so for now, seperate cages if the yellow one is actually attacking it. it has to learn to become more social. and that takes time. let them talk to each other. and then when it seems like they are getting together, let them play together.|`|0B4plcLEaa	In our "flock" I have a quaker and a sunday conure that share a cage, and have bonded pretty well. We started them out in seperate cages, and introduced them slowly to each other. Soon they became best buddies and preen and snuggle together. They still have squabbles, most birds do. They are territorial, and like to show dominance. Our other two quakers are caged in different cages and they don't get along, and they've made no attempt to as of yet. <br>  Birds are funny, you really never know what's gonna happen until you put two (or more) together.  Don't get fustrated, birds can sense everything, and they don't forget it either. If I have learned anything with my experience being a bird owner, it's you definatley have to be patient!! Try getting another cage, and setting them next to one another. Take them out together a few times a day ( on neutral territory ) and see how they react together. We used a playgym with lots of toys. They started playing together, now they are inseparable!! Good luck|`|6d0d172131851cb6698a45e928d33b7baa	Well, you need to be sorry about a little more than misspelling.  Here goes:  Two birds - two cages.  Quality time with you.  The one on one thing.  You cannot teach anyone or anything with "punishment".  They will only learn fear. And you wonder why they don't get along!!!!  What are you teaching them?  Vicious looks? C'mon!!!!  It has learned, from you, to be afraid.  Give them both away to someone who knows birds.|`|S7Okbzm2aa	I think it is because the yellow bird is not used to being around other birds. My advice to you is to let the yellow bird be around the gray just a little a day to get to know it and get used to it. But keep the yellow bird in a seperate cage most of the time.

lVVejVhLaa	Clipping dogs isn't easy...you just don't by a clipper and some blades and clip away.  You should get lessons from a groomer or better from the breeder you bought you dog from.  It can be very dangerous for the novice dog person to clip their dog.  You can easily nick them or cut them seriously.  You can burn your dog, or clip in the wrong direction and take the hair off shorter than you wanted.  I have groomed my own dogs for over 30 yrs and been a professional groomer for over 17 yrs.  I have had dogs brought to me that owners have tried to clip and I have to fix the chopped up coat, or deal with a dog that has been cut and nicked so it hates being groomed.  I have many sets of clippers, blades and scissors that people bought to do their own grooming and give to me because they can't do it, hurt their dog, did a bad job, etc.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	i hope the person that said that is was a cocker not an english need to look up the breed  before  the person make a comment about a breed of dog.       What you can do to talk to a groomer in  your town or find a breeder of english cockers to help you.|`|AEgyejCNaa	A video and a website with instructions isn't going to magically teach you how to groom a cocker. You can easily nick or seriously cut your dog if you don't have enough experience. Ears are paper thin when scissors or clippers are concerned, and you'd be surprised at how easy it is to cut a piece of the ear off when you don't have a firm grip of your dog (and God bless you if you can use scissors/clippers and hold a dog still at the same time).<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that non-groomers can't groom their Cocker's--just that a website and a video is nothing compared to experience and patience.<br>  <br>  Not to mention you can easily mess up your dogs coat and it can come out horribly--but if this is insignificant for you, then all I can say is take care, have a good grip of your dog, and think about saving up some money and taking it to a reputable professional groomer instead.|`|O3slDqEEaa	ok i had a cocker!! ok .first when they eat you have to tie their ears back and often get a swob and clean out their ears!!! if you live near a lake becareful cause they hunt ducks!!<a href="http://www.geocities.com/no1wonder/spaniel/care_en.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/no1wonder/spani...</a><br>  good luck and enjoy it!!!|`|YJmGf4RLaa	you need to take a grooming course, & its a COCKER spaniel.   in the mean time take the dog to a real groomer
lj46HCfQaa	Los perros son animales sociales, viven en manadas y necesitan vivir en un grupo social o familia. Sin embargo muchos perros viven con duenio que trabajan todo el dia y estan lo mas bien, si te aseguras de darle un buen entrenamiento tu perro va a estar bien. <br>  Aca van algunos consejos:<br>  <br>  1- Saca a tu perro a pasear 2 veces al dia, cuando sea adulto por lo menos 30 min cada paseo.<br>  <br>  2- compra juguetes que la hagan pensar, por ejemplo existen cubos de un plástico bien resistente en donde pones pedacitos de comida adentro. Tu perra tiene que mover el cubo con el hocico para poder obtener la comida, hay otros (también de goma con un agujero en el centro) que podes rellenar con queso blando y crear capas (queso, pedacitos de comida, etc) lo pones en el congelador y antes de salir se lo das a tu perra para que se entretenga. <br>  <br>  3- ense?a le a tu perra a dormir durante el día en una jaula para perros. Compra le una jaula que sea lo suficientemente grande para que se pueda dar vuelta cómodamente y cada vez que la pongas ahí dale algún premio o el segundo juguete que mencione antes. Si te aseguras de que siempre que esta en su jaula tiene un premio, tu perra va a adorar estar ahí. A primera vista esto te puede resultar feo, pero lo cierto es que los perros necesitan de un lugar asi y se sienten mas seguros cuando lo tienen. Si haces esto tienes que dejarlo ir al banio cada 4 horas por lo menos y cuando sea adulto cada 6-8 horas. <br>  <br>  4- Tienes que ense?arle a tu perro que tu eres el líder de la familia. Un buen líder es capaz de mantener a su familia sana, salva, bien alimentada y bajo un techo. Los lideres además tienen ciertas ventajas (porque hacen el trabajo mas duro). Como tu eres el líder tienes que aprovecharte de estas ventajas: Tu comes primero (y además le das de comer a tu perro); tu elijes donde dormir o descansar, es decir si quieres el sillón haz que tu perro se baje de el para que tu puedas sentarte (pon un pedacito de comida bajo su nariz y muevelo fuera del sillón). Tu empiezas y terminas los juegos y cualquier otro tipo de contacto (si tu perro te pide de jugar o te pide mimos ignoralo por unos segundos y cuando este distraida empieza el juego o los mimos tu). Estas reglas son importantes sobre todo cuando el perro esta aprendiendo, pero una vez que tu perro te haga caso puedes evitar tener en cuenta todo esto y solo hacerlo de vez en cuando para recordarle.<br>  <br>  5- ense?a le a tu perra los comandos básicos y siempre usa métodos de entrenamiento que utilizan refuerzo positivo!<br>  <br>  Mira las fuentes que cito para mas detalles.<br>  <br>  Siempre usa métodos de entrenamiento que usen refuerzo positivo!|`|HKqHdHUHaa	creo que los animales son muy inteligentes y por lo tanto nos extra?an. para mi el dejarlo que duerma con ustedes es bueno pero hay personas a las cuales no les gusta y lo ven mal. sigue consintiendolo y dale mucho cari?o cuando estes con el.|`|1ccc29eb414ed2d3390e5ff24e51c223aa	mira, no es bueno dejarlo solito tanto tiempo, sin embaro entiendo que debemos trabajar.

qrjjo7AJaa	Oh it can get a LOT worse.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who has horses.<br>  <br>  She was renting a barn to keep the three horses in.  I would guess that the owner of the property had about 20-25 acres. <br>  <br>  The friend is absolutely fastidious about keeping the horses clean.  <br>  <br>  Because of suburban expansion, a developer had erected a subdivision right next to this mini-farm.  They had one neighbor who was constantly complaining.<br>  <br>  My friend's daughter had a rabbit that "mysteriously" died one day.  Because we have a mutual friend who works at a vet office, they did an autopsy.  It turned out that the rabbit had been poisoned.<br>  <br>  A couple of days later, they get served to appear in court because of the nuisance that the horses were making.  <br>  <br>  When they showed up in court, the judge started off with the plaintiff.  This woman had filed 20 complaints over 5 years.  Prior to the horses, the owner of the property had a couple of cows and the plaintiff complained about them mooing too loud.<br>  <br>  The judge asked the plaintiff, who was there first, the farm or her suburban house?  The farm had been there about 100 years, the house 5.  <br>  <br>  The judge threw the case out and told the homeowner that if she filed ONE more complaint he would find her in contempt of court and throw her in jail.<br>  <br>  You have a right to own a well mannered dog.

Not me  personally. But I will tell you that if you have jerks for neighbors (and I should know, I live in an apt. complex that seem to have revolving doors in the units beside mine) they may say just about anything, even if untrue, to hurt you.  However, the Humane Society people deal with that a lot I hear.  As long as you are caring for your doggie in a positive way, you will be okay.  Just make sure you don't make a wrong move even once...that may be the one time your neighbors are watching. UGH!  Some people in this world are nutso! Good luck with it.|`|Rgqwp1PVaa	I have the same dog. But maybe your neighbors should just shove their complaints up there butt and shut up about it. But the next dorr neighbors just smelled themselves, but didn't want to admit it so they blamed it on your dog. You would know if there are feces because you live in the same house your dog does. Also there are dogs running around free, so maybe it is some stray dogs. Did they ever think of that?|`|bfkDB490aa	Don't worry about this guy.  If you ever watch Animal Cops on Animal Planet you see there's alot of idiots like this.

He weighed 343 pounds, and was over 8 feet long from nose to tail.

0b6691be66651a8e0f44ae92e9fce0a2aa	Hi there...Soy is a vegetable protein  and it is high in protein.  The phyto-estrogens in it can cause hormonal imbalance, increasing the T4 which the thyroid secretes which can lead to hyperthroidism. Soy contains trypsin inhibitors which also interferes with protein digestion. Soy also has phytic acid which interferes with mineral absorption.<br>  <br>  There was study down in the US at a zoo which wanted to breed cheetahs. The cheetahs were fed meat and then soy was used as an "extender". These cats became infertile and suffered liver damage. Cheetahs from other zoos not using soy in the diet were successful in their breeding programs.<br>  <br>  Ideally, it would not be best to give cats soy based products to protect it from any potential liver damage.|`|83452feb5fa99a172290f21a90fb6daaaa	soy can cause allergic reactions in cats ( and dogs for this matter) some can be mild like dry, itchy, red skin...or some can be fatal. and over a period of time...soy will harden cats arteries... i would avoid soy milk...and once the cats are cats and not kittens they should have no milk. and if you have kittens use kitten replacement milk...they can not digest cows milk...|`|I3LCP4WMaa	You want to do this because you think cats drink milk- they don't .

1e00690821e002cda23d3ac6cac96ccdaa	In our county, the police say the noise ordinance begins at 11pm and ends at 7am. Your dog can bark all day long all long as it stops during those hours, and they really aren't violating any laws, so you may not have much luck with the police if it is the same in your area. You might try animal control to see if an officer will speak with the owners, but since you have already tried  to speak to them, it probably won't do a bit of good. <br>  <br>  Do you have an HOA in your neighborhood? If so, contact the president. HOAs tend to be the quickest to get involved in a problem dispute such as yours. If you don't have an HOA, do you have other neighbors who are equally disturbed by this dog? If so, ask them to call the police at the same time you are calling the police. If they get numerous calls from several neighbors, they may be more inclined to view this as a disturbance even if it is not during any "noise ordinance" hours.<br>  <br>  Any idea WHY the dog is barking? Is it just a yappy breed (i.e. terrier, herding breed)? Is it in need of something, like water? Does it appear to be cared for? If the dog seems to be lacking for anything, animal control will gladly look into potential neglect, and may possibly remove the dog from the premises if they find evidence of such. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|2xcRU4uMaa	I would call your local police or animal control for disturbing the peace i wish my nieghbors were as nice as you my dog barked at them one time and they immediately called the cops instead of talking to us and our dog was barking for like 2 mintus|`|AA11443269	I don't like people like this and the only solution I have ever found is to call animal control, every county has one.<br>  Peerhaps sjust a single visit from them will quell the sitution<br>  <br>  You can take legal action also because they are infringing upon your property|`|FEWVLCPFaa	First of all i would comfront the owner, since that didint work for you, call animal control or the police.

That job also covers noise control, and they should have some ideas about what you should do.<br>  <br>  One thing we did years ago (when we had neighbours that had a dog that would start barking in the middle of the night) was ring them up and when they answered hung up. After a few nights they got the idea. I'm not sure if it would work now with *10#.<br>  <br>  If the mouthy neighbour is that bad, call the cops over her objectionable words.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|IRKOFUMlaa	That sounds so much like my neighbors except their dogS bark/whine the whole time the owners are gone. We have been having problems with our neighbors for a few months now and they recently called the police out for us walking on their grass (how stupid is that) but before the police came they let their dogs out after one of our guests and we told the cop about that and about how they just let their dogs run all over the place without regard to others and the cop told us to call animal control while the activity is happening. So that is what I suggest to you is to call your local animal control and start making complaints. To make your case really be known get some type of recorder and record the dog barking from your property the full length of the barking that way when it has been just to much you have some proof to show the authorities just how much the dog does bark and for how long.|`|78458b25f2ae7bcdc8b613bbcd7b68d6aa	call the police or animal control. they should take care of it. i know what you mean. the problem gets worse when the owners dont corroperate. i'd say call with the police or animal control.|`|AA11709234	Haven't you called the police a few times yet?????

8NSh1D4Maa	Raw meaty bones (get them from your butcher), raw turkey necks, raw chicken backs, etc are all good choices here.  The tearing of the flesh from the bone, and, in the case of the poultry, crunching through the bones (which are safe as long as they are totally raw and uncooked), will do a much better job than anything short of a vet cleaning under anesthesia.  Make sure they are fresh, and avoid weight-bearing long bones.  However, if the smell is a result of an abscessed tooth, these will not help and the dog should see a vet to have the tooth removed.  <br>  <br>  Rawhides don't help much and are actually hazardous to your dog's health- they are chemically bleached and also highly indigestible, pose a choking hazard and can cause digestive obstructions.  |`|eRAbbvUjaa	I see alot of thumbs down for people suggesting brush the dogs teeth,which unfortunately could be the best answer.<br>  If you just can't face doing this disgusting task then take your dog to a pet groomers every few months and pay them to have the dogs teeth cleaned.<br>  Failing that the best chews for cleaning dogs teeth are rough and tough rubbers, KONG rubber is great but you need something that will get inbetween his teeth so take a look and see what toys they have in your local pet store as no two stores ever seam to stock the same things in my experience.|`|DpzQ2Z1daa	Brush his teeth with doggy toothpaste.|`|kqMhvZP4aa	Brush his Teeth|`|7a51Aqp2aa	brush his teeth, <br>  get him bones that are for breath |`|Okv7KDMXaa	i agree  with mike|`|Xtqq71KGaa	brush his teeth.  they make special brushes for dogs.  and you can get kitty flavored toothpaste (just kidding, but it does have some kind of meaty flavor that dogs like).|`|XlGjBPBTaa	Get an old tooth brush and sit down with him and let him chew on it a little and then start brushing his teeth gently.

QjKvceKeaa	In all my experiences, cats that are from the same litter are usually closer and have a stronger bond than those who are not. I think they do know they're related somehow. I usually try and give my kittens away in pairs because I feel they usually get along better and are closer to their litter mates. |`|Xtqq71KGaa	i don't know about cats, but i've seen 2 dogs who were separated shortly after weaning- when they were reunited it was like they'd never been apart.  i've seen this also with a ***** and one of her offspring.<br>  <br>  omg, i can't believe they won't let me call a female dog a *****!!!|`|iJtuhLMTaa	2 kittens raised together will have a stronger bond than cats introduced later in life regardless of if they are litter mates or not.

I had work with cat that were not related, and personal, that is.. when they are separated, they will look for the other... <br>  <br>  hope this help:<br>  <br>  When a kitten is born, it knows nothing of the world around it. However, it does know enough to stay close to its mom and the milk bar. The only important task for the kitten during the neonatal period is to (subconsciously) maintain a degree of physiological balance. Nursing and sleeping are about all a kitten is capable of at this stage. <br>  <br>  After a week or ten days of hanging around mom, the kitten's eyes and ear canals open and it begins to process information about the surrounding world. Reflexes and mother's care have brought the kitten thus far but increasingly, know-how, including the establishment of proper relationships with others, becomes necessary for its continued success in life. The first and most important relationship a kitten forms is with its mom. <br>  <br>  If a kitten is separated from its mom, she will retrieve it. If it cries, she will attend to it. If it is hungry she will feed it.<br>  <br>  |`|Uy79dKEmaa	I really can't say about 2 unrelated cats, but I can speak from experience that my two litter mates have an incredible bond.  I have a brother and sister, and they are practically inseparable.  They do everything together.  Sleep, eat, play, whatever!  If one does not see the other, they will start meowing until they find each other again.  It's pretty amazing.<br>  <br>  These 2 kitties were abandoned at a very early age and for a while all they had was each other.  It's cute the way the boy watches out for his smaller sister.  But, she's definitely got a little more common sense than he does.  He's the brawn, she's the brain.

However the kittens you raise together from a young age are more apt to get along faster and better than any of the cats you bring in after they are full grown.

It takes older cats longer ... |`|RRzUfvwXaa	They won't retain a close bond because they are from the same litter, but if you are choosing to raise them both then they will have a stronger bond than most other cats because they have been raised together for their entire lives.|`|Fu7OK54kaa	no they don't, my male cat keeps sniffing around his daughter!

IMPvzBk1aa	I'm posting a list of veterinary articles on proud flesh for you to look through.  Note that caustics are not advised in treating proud flesh, and also note that the best approach is to prevent it from forming in the first place. Because horses often injure their lower limbs, and the circulation is such that healing may be slow, these injuries are more prone to over-healing.

Just a small bump now but when you touch it you can feel that it's larger than you'd think.<br>  The other is the front of the fetlock (puncture).  In this pic it's still being healed up.  She did something and broke it open again which made it worse.  I couldn't get the proud flesh under control.  This scab area is now white hair and a large bumpy area of hard flesh.<br>  <a href="http://inlinethumb10.webshots.com/40969/2003965730100926052S600x600Q85.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://inlinethumb10.webshots.com/40969/...</a><br>  <br>  The granulation is not in her way so I'm not going to bother having it cut off.  Because of it being on a joint is one huge reason for it being so difficult keeping the proud flesh at bay.|`|DLxh9CANaa	Proud flesh is basically a way of saying that the tissues in a wound or sore have over granulated or overgrown. Granulation is a normal process- it's the basis of healing when anyone, be it horse or person, suffers a wound. Sometimes, though, this process can get out of control, and the result is an ugly lump or mound, instead of a clean, healed wound. Proud flesh also bleeds easily and is very delicate- and what's worse, it often will smell bad if the horse has an underlying infection. In some ways, it can be compared to gangrene in a person. <br>  <br>  Most of the time, proud flesh is usually treated with caustics, which kill the over granulated tissue and cause it to dry up and fall off, re-exposing the original wound, which then must be treated as a fresh wound would be. It's common to have to repeat this process more than once, because once a wound has had proud flesh one time, it needs careful attention or the proud flesh will return.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	It's caused by a horse getting injured and the wound not cleaned out thoroughly before it starts healing.  Horse's cuts heal from the inside out, not like our's where we get a cut and then we get a scab. <br>  <br>  Proud Flesh is when the wound tries to heal on the top first.<br>  <br>  The first time I saw a scar from proud flesh was in 1972, when my trainer's then 3 year old TB gelding, J K Junior, had had it as a yearling.  It had cleared up, but left a NASTY scar.<br>  <br>  I've had friends that have either given horses away or had them put down because they could NOT get it cleared up on a horse (Normally a joint issue).<br>  <br>  The best way to clear it up is to clean the wound properly with hydrogen peroxide, then use a betadine scrub and finally believe it or NOT, WONDER DUST!  It has the caustic ingredients to keep the moisture out and allow the wound to heal.  If the wound is on a leg, then use a wrap after you've doctored on it to prevent dirt from getting into it.  Wrapping with gauze, then cotton and finally vet wrap to keep it dry.|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	Another great answer from Galloppal!<br>  <br>  Proud flesh is the excessive growth of granulation tissue within a wound that inhibits closure of the skin. In severe cases, proud flesh can protrude well beyond the original wound and become a target of parasites and infection. Proud flesh is a common complication of wounds at or below the knee and hock, but most heal without incident if they are handled properly at the beginning. This means thoroughly cleaning the wound, taking care to remove irritants such as metal particles, rope fibers and dead tissue (especially bone, tendon or ligament). Beyond that, you can reduce the chances that proud flesh will develop by keeping the wound clean and protecting it from:<br>  <br>      Rubbing, licking, biting and contact with pasture vegetation, sand or gravel;<br>      Disturbance caused by motion that opens and closes the gap in the skin;<br>      Flies and other creatures that will attempt to feed on or infect the site.<br>  <br>  Hosing with clean water may be the best way to remove surface debris and reduce local wound swelling. Bandaging helps reduce adverse influences but does not speed the healing process or prevent the formation of proud flesh. The best way to prevent proud flesh is to ensure that all of the above criteria are met and if you do notice it forming, call your veterinarian right away to assess the situation before it gets a half-inch or more above the wound edges. The best treatment is for the vet to trim excess flesh back. It bleeds alot, but there are no nerve endings in the granulation tissue, so it doesn't bhurt the horse.<br>  <br>  My youngster got proud flesh when he had a field accident as a yearling, where he almost pulled his front right hoof off. He was encased in plaster for weeks on end, and with each dressing change we cut the flesh back. He now has a minimal scar where the injury occured, and has no further issues associated with that leg.<br>  <br>  Using caustic agents on proud flesh is a treatment from the dark ages!|`|3wIZiZA5aa	<a href="http://www.netpets.org/horses/healthspa/flesh.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.netpets.org/horses/healthspa/...</a><br>  <br>  Here ya go!|`|ZDFw8o1Saa	Proud flesh is excess skin that build up around a wound that may or may not have been severe.  Some horses have more of tendency to develope it. It is also the scar tissue that developes.<br>  <br>  Treatment:<br>  Supplies-  vet wrap, bandage wraps, caustic powder, gauze, some cotton<br>  The procedure-  put caustic powder on the wound and on the gauze.  quickly press the gauze to the wound and place cotton over the gauze.  Then you wrap the bandages around the leg finally placing the vet wrap over top to hold it in place.  (sometimes tape is also needed as an aid)  This information here is assuming that the proud flesh is located on a wound somewhere on the legs.  I'm no vet but I've taken care of several horses with proud flesh.  <br>  The treatment also has to be repeated every couple days (usually 2 or 3 days) until all the flesh appears to be gone.  You want to be careful though because the caustic power with eat away the healing skin.  A wound with proud flesh should be ventilate for about a day after you remove the bandages.  It is a tricky process but it can save your horse from potentially problematic scar tissue.<br>  <br>  Thoroughbredtrainin'girl|`|n2dUmfcQaa	<a href="http://www.horserides.org/proud-flesh.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.horserides.org/proud-flesh.ht...</a><br>  <br>  beware nasty pictures but it shows you what it is!|`|5kUxkun3aa	Proud flesh is a cut that  heals. And It grow outwards. Normally it is trimmed back and pressure dressings are applied.
XKNQkwuGaa	try all the ideas on here. my dogs are the same way and destroy all their toys so i give them empy soda bottles with the caps on and they love to twist off the tops and squish the bottles and toss them around then i give them new ones. at least they are handy and cheap.old socks and stuffed toys are a fav but there is userally stuffing every where in minutes and then the squeaky that is inside is tossed around and played with.frisbbees.tennis balls or baseballs is good too.the tops off margerine bowls or yogart is another way they can amuse themselves for a little while but they can chew them up and swallow the plastic so i watch them play with these until it gets to demolished. go to a second hand store and get stuffed toys or baby teething rings along with old socks etc and keep a box of them available to replace when the old toys are shot then u will have play things for them when needed.i keep a box full so there is always something to keep them amused and at second hand stores or garage sales u can get a lot of this stuff cheap and just toss them away when they are chewed up with out the big expense of replaceing toys all the time. my 3 dogs are always wanting to play so i go through a lot of toys and just clean up the mess afterward and give them a new one, its like christmas to my dogs and they are pretty happy to have a quick replacment.  as soon as u feel better check out the local used stores and get some toys and u will always have them on hand until u repalce the stash the next time. i hope u feel better soon.good luck.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	i know that you said that they wont play with  hard rubber toy.         Find ones that you can put food inside of and see if this will get then to like hard rubber  toys.|`|E9KyCM6baa	I'm of the opinion that that's pretty much what a toy is for, to be destroyed.  That way other things don't get destroyed.  Are you giving them enough stuff that they can actually chew?  We give ours bully sticks from the local feed store.  They digest much better than pig ears or hooves.  And our three dogs, two of them Cattle Dogs who can be notoriously destructive, spend a good hour working on only 6" long sticks.  I'll buy the full length bully, about 3' to 3.5', and use a saw to cut it down to 6" sticks.  Much cheaper that way.  We also like the Paw Tracks tire on a rope.  It's like a small go-kart tire on a thick rope.  My Red Heeler will chew it up eventually but it lasts about 4 months at least.  It'll look pretty ratty for a while but he loves it.  His new favorite toy is two Jolly Balls, for horses, tied together with a rope with about 10" between them.  He chews the rope more than the balls.  Stuffed animals are out of the question for our guys, they'll be gutted immediately if left unsupervised.  We'll keep those up in a toy basket out of reach.  Then when we are training or they do something special we'll bring them down and play toss with those.  Our Red has learned to actually point to the basket with a raised paw (no joke) when he wants one of the stuffies out of the basket.  <br>  <br>  Edit-  I just remembered that another of my Red Heeler's favorite is an empty gallon milk jug.  It makes a lot of racket when tossed around.  But he seems to like the fact he can crush it repeatedly.<br>  <br>  Have you tried stuffing the kong with food like peanut butter?  Room tempurature can work but freezing it will give them something to do for quite a while.  And I've never known a dog to pass up peanut butter flavored anything.|`|FdcWPp48aa	If you have any old socks you can tie knots in them and let them destroy them.  Also old dish towels. Also, my dog loves to tear up cardboard.  She gets to do this once in a while.  You will need to supervise them as you don't want them eating this stuff.|`|JCozkN7faa	Do they have a favorite toy they don't chew up?<br>  <br>  Example like my dog there favorite toy is a ball. I have bought other toys they chew them up but the balls they don't.<br>  <br>  I made a ball sock and they loved it. You  just need a sock and a tennis ball. then put the tennis ball not the sock and toss it for your dog and they play with it.<br>  <br>  Mine love the ball sock! I don't buy plush anymore because they rip out the stuffing and the squeaker first and then don't play with the toy.|`|e3ibrvCRaa	Try putting some treats in the kong - then maybe a slice of carrot in the end blocking them falling out. I wish you luck as there is nothing worse than dogs with too much energy and nothing to do. Maybe you could try hiding some treats around the house and getting them to sniff them out too!|`|t8YDZSHtaa	Have you tried tossing a ball outside, it doesn't have to be rubber it can be a tennis ball, even a frisbee.|`|A5wYF0goaa	 I understand your frustration! My dogs can and would destroy all the toys I bought them. Like yours, they did not like the hard rubber toys. Two things.....First and foremost, my vet says not to give the "rope" toys because the strings will wrap around their intestines and cause death. Second, I bought the hard rubber toys and left them out for a couple days....with nothing else to play with, they learned to play with them!  Good luck!!!!|`|lK68KOjUaa	I believe your dogs need a long nice walk with you every day.. specially if you are up early, a good solution would be to put on your running shoes and go with your dogs.. At least, get in the garden and play fetch with them. that is your responsibility, toys are not enough<br>  <br>  Other than that, tennis balls won't last for ever but it's cheap |`|ecYNiE0maa	rope toys are cheap so get a few of them maybe the thicker rope also have you tried the toys made out of tire rubber or the kong
jyGTlpzTaa	Sounds pretty good. It is a good idea to rotate and use different veg to give the guineas different nutrients though. Other things you can try are carrot, celery (not too much of this), different types of lettuces like rocket and lollo rosso (just not iceberg), spinach, bell pepper, there's lots of things you can try.<br>  <br>  Also, if you continue to feed guinea pig mix (like the muesli style stuff), ensure every last grain is eaten before you add more...it is important for the pigs to eat all the bits of their food, not just the bits they like, in order to be healthy. As long as they always have hay they will not starve. Or, you can try changing them to complete pellet diets...these look very boring but contain all the nutrients for your little piggy, and because they are all the same they cant selectively feed.|`|RjyNInW6aa	You sound like a great owner.

yiHP6bQbaa	Her, um, doggie vagina gets swollen like when she's in heat. Her nipples become enlarged and sometimes engorged with milk. She may be grouchy. She can even put on some weight. I thought my dog a few years ago was preggo and took her to the vet. A vet tech really thought she felt a puppy move, and did an xray on her to verify. Turns out, there were no puppies. This "pregnancy" just kinda went away on its own. I'm no expert, but I would take her to the vet just so you can know for certain what's going on with your dog. Best of luck!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	If your dog is acting weird, she needs to see the vet.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	the signs of a phantom pregnancy are exactly like those of a real pregnancy and you won't know the difference unless you take her to the vet to get her checked out.  until it comes time to whelp and if it were me, I'd rather know way before then just in case!|`|JVvnET59aa	First of all...has your dog had access to a male dog while in heat? If so, it is possible that she is really pregnant!! When a dog has phantom pregnancy the signs are exactly the same as a real pregnancy!

Take her to the vet and he can perform a palpation and possibly xrays to find out if it's real or not!!|`|XZYvH1ETaa	my dog has them every year, she goes round picking up cuddling toys and pretending they're puppies and cries a lot when she can't find them.

qZYDWjHjaa	Los perros y los gatos: ?Son inteligentes? ?Pueden pensar? ?Tienen imaginación? ?Tienen sentimientos?  <br>  Es muy frecuente escuchar en diferentes ámbitos (científico, religioso, popular) respuestas contundentemente negativas a estos interrogantes. Pero sin embargo... <br>   <br>  Autor: Claudio Gerzovich  <br>   <br>  <br>  Para quienes sostienen esta postura los seres humanos somos los únicos seres inteligentes sobre nuestro planeta, los únicos que actuamos racionalmente, los únicos que podemos pensar y aún más los únicos que tenemos sentimientos (amor, odio, celos, culpa). <br>  <br>  Un exponente de esta corriente del pensamiento fue el filósofo francés René Descartes (siglo XVII). Descartes sostenía que los animales carecían de estado consciente, de inteligencia y de cualquier proceso mental análogo al del ser humano. <br>  <br>  Muchos psicólogos y fisiólogos compartieron, e incluso comparten en la actualidad, este concepto. Para ellos los procesos mentales superiores que rigen el comportamiento humano están gobernados por principios distintos de aquellos que rigen el comportamiento animal. <br>  <br>  Suelen afirmar que los comportamientos de los animales son de dos tipos: instintivos y producto del condicionamiento. Si bien es cierto que el movimiento de la cola en los perros y el ronroneo de los gatos son comportamientos instintivos, la risa, la sonrisa y el llanto de los humanos también lo son. Evidentemente no sólo los animales son portadores de este tipo de patrones de comportamiento. <br>  <br>  Por otro lado, muchos propietarios de perros y gatos, haciendo caso omiso de las mencionadas opiniones, piensan de manera diferente. "A mi perro sólo le falta hablar", "mi gato es sumamente inteligente, mucho más que muchas personas que conozco", "mi gato odia a mi vecina porque ella odia a los gatos", "mi perro es tan inteligente que cuando quiere salir a pasear me trae la correa y cuando quiere jugar me trae su pelota", son comentarios corrientes entre estos propietarios. <br>  <br>  Si bien la mayoría de estas personas no son imparciales producto de que tienen un vínculo sumamente estrecho con sus animales y además no poseen los conocimientos para realizar estudios objetivos, ellos no dudan en afirmar que sus animales son inteligentes, pueden pensar y desde ya tienen sentimientos. <br>  <br>  ?Cuál de estas dos visiones acerca de estos temas es la correcta? ?Dentro del ámbito científico existen opiniones que avalen las afirmaciones recién mencionadas? Para contestar el primer interrogante es necesario aclarar a que nos referimos cuando hablamos de inteligencia, pensamiento, imaginación y sentimientos. <br>  <br>  Tomemos como ejemplo a la inteligencia. Una definición que tiene consenso entre la mayoría de los científicos es aquella que dice que la inteligencia es la capacidad de enfrentar símbolos, relaciones y nuevas situaciones o problemas y resolverlos de una manera adecuada. A partir de esta definición muchos sostienen que la inteligencia de los perros y de los gatos es más un mito que una realidad. <br>  <br>  Sin embargo, desde la filosofía Aristóteles (384-322 a.C.) sostenía que la razón de los animales difería de la nuestra no por su naturaleza sino del más al menos. A su vez un científico prominente como Charles Darwin en su libro La descendencia del hombre sostenía que la diferencia entre la inteligencia de los seres humanos y la de muchos animales era cuestión de grado y no de clase. <br>  <br>  Más aún Darwin afirmaba que "las distintas emociones y facultades —como el amor, la memoria, la atención, la curiosidad, la imitación, etc.— de las que se jacta el hombre, se encuentran en forma incipiente y a veces bien desarrolladas en los animales inferiores". <br>  <br>  Otras autoridades científicas comparten esta visión de los hechos. El Profesor Donald Griffin (autor del libro Animal Awareness), el Dr. Stephen Walker (autor del libro Animal Thought) y especialmente una de las autoridades más conocidas y reconocidas en cánidos, el Dr. Michael W. Fox (autor de innumerables artículos científicos y varios libros) concluyen que los animales poseen, en grado variable, capacidad de razonamiento, sentimientos y comportamiento inteligente. <br>  <br>  Veamos como algunos ejemplos cotidianos, que todo due?o de perro y gato reconocerá haber observado en algún momento de la convivencia con sus animales, parecen demostrar que es posible afirmar que los seres humanos no somos portadores exclusivos de los atributos que estamos tratando. <br>  <br>  Inteligencia: Un perro roba una servilleta a su propietario y para no ser alcanzado comienza a correr alrededor de la mesa. El due?o sumamente enojado comienza a perseguirlo. Por supuesto el perro corre más rápido que él. <br>  <br>  El humano, poseedor de una gran inteligencia, decide dar la vuelta y corre para el lado opuesto intentando de esa manera atrapar al perro. Para su sorpresa el perro hace lo mismo. Conclusión el due?o del perro agotado y sin poder agarrar a su animal decide esperar a que éste se digne a dejar la servilleta. Evidentemente el perro se enfrento a un problema y lo resolvió de una manera adecuada. <br>  <br>  Soberbia: Un gato camina por una medianera en dirección a su territorio. Repentinamente abajo aparece un perro que ladra y quiere atraparlo. La altura de la pared es de dos metros. El perro salta pero no llega más allá de un metro ochenta centímetros. <br>  <br>  El gato percibe esto y en lugar de continuar caminando se pavonea por el borde de la medianera observando como el perro infructuosamente intenta atraparlo.<br>  <br>  Depresión (tristeza): Una familia sale de vacaciones y decide dejar a su gato en un pensionado para gatos. El animal presenta anorexia (deja de comer), adipsia (deja de beber) y permanece indiferente a todo tipo de estímulo. <br>  <br>  Odio: En el vecindario hay un ni?o que habitualmente pasa por una casa donde hay un perro tras una reja. El ni?o azuza cotidianamente al perro a través de la reja. El perro cada vez que el ni?o realiza esta acción ladra con furia. <br>  <br>  El ni?o sigue su camino y deja en paz al perro. En la casa donde vive el perro hay ni?os y habitualmente van amiguitos con los cuales el perro presenta un comportamiento ejemplar. Un día el propietario del perro al salir a pasear con su animal se sorprende al percibir que su perro intenta abalanzarse y agredir a un ni?o en la calle por lo que debe retenerlo de la correa con fuerza para evitar que el ni?o sea agredido. Será fácil para el lector deducir qué ni?o había sido blanco de la agresión del perro. <br>  <br>  Amor: Una familia convive con tres perros. Uno de ellos muere. La familia consternada decide enterrar al animal en el jardín de la casa. Los otros dos perros están al lado de los humanos durante el entierro. <br>  <br>  Una vez finalizado el mismo la familia se retira del lugar. Los perros se quedan. Una de las personas los llama. Los perros acuden pero luego regresan al lado de la tumba. Durante tres días los perros permanecen allí la mayor parte del día. Al cuarto día la familia decide consultar con un especialista para tratar de terminar con el sufrimiento de los perros. <br>  <br>  Como conclusión vale la pena citar una frase de Porfirio (filósofo griego, 232-304 d.C.):"Si los hombres tienen más inteligencia que los animales, esto no es una razón para sostener que los animales no la tienen en absoluto; del mismo modo sería erróneo sostener que las perdices no vuelan porque los gavilanes vuelan mejor que ellas". <br>  <br>  Antes de finalizar es importante aclarar que si bien los animales evidentemente poseen los atributos analizados y por lo tanto son emocionalmente similares a nosotros poseyendo además habilidades mentales, sería un grave error creer que ellos se acercan a nuestra capacidad de pensamiento y sobre todo a la del pensamiento abstracto. <br>  <br>  Si bien nosotros somos parte del reino animal dado que compartimos muchas características con otros animales, tenemos algunas características exclusivas que nos separan de todos ellos. La más importante de ellas es la cultura, la cual ha hecho que nos diferenciemos enormemente del resto de las especies que habitan nuestro|`|qhuKKGYBaa	Los animales claro que tienen sentimientos e inteligencia. Es un mito muy antiguo el que dice que no sienten, pero desde el a?o 350 A.C. Aristoteles encontró evidencia de que los animales tienen emociones.

oldyBYklaa	Putting gloves on a gerbil serves no useful purpose.  I have a very large book entitled 'Stop Your Gerbil Biting', which I recommend you obtain. You don't need the book to learn how to stop your gerbil biting you - but if he does it again, swat the little f*ck*r with the book. Works every time.|`|EdN7fkTgaa	First, make sure that you wash your hands with a soap that doesn't have any strong smells. If your gerbil smells something fruity or flowery on your hands, he might try to taste it!<br>  <br>  Sometimes, you can make a gerbil more comfortable with your hands if you rub them in his bedding first so that your hands smell like the rest of the things in his tank. (If you do this, make sure you wash your hands after you're done playing with your gerbil. That's always a good idea anyway!)<br>  <br>  If your gerbil still nibbling and biting, just blow a puff of air in his face when he does it. Blow the puff of air just like you were blowing out one last candle on a birthday cake. My gerbils don't like puffs of air in the face, and it won't take your gerbil long to figure out that every time he puts your skin in his mouth, he gets a quick puff of air. This won't hurt him, but it will help him learn not to bite you.|`|4gjPQFBDaa	Talk to him and put your hand in the cage to allow him to smell it. When you do handle him, make sure he is awake, then pick him up slowly by cupping both hands around him gently but firmly. Do not hold him high in the air as he may escape from your hands and fall. The rubbing your hands in his bedding is a very good suggestion, but also make sure your gerbil can see your hands coming otherwise he may thing your a predator trying to eat him!<br>  <br>  Yours is probably not used to you handling him properly. I bought 2 gerbils about 2 years ago and at first I took them out and handled them everyday to get used to me but then I changed jobs and never had enough time for them. They were fed and watered. They'd also have a good run around when I was cleaning their cage out (once a week) so they were well kept just not handled that often. Anyway, one passed away after a year but the other is still hanging around but he will hardly ever let you hold him because he's just not use to it and it scares him. <br>  <br>  This is probably the case with your gerbil. Just keep handling him gently and reassuring him - he'll get use to it! <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|e1bc9ee12a586a97194ed85c52656355aa	I have 4 gerbils so I hope I can be of some insight. <br>  First of all, gloves will scare it enough to bite. As if our hands aren't scary enough to those little creatures, gloves just amplify the fear. Make sure your hands are always clean when you enter their cage. Since you need to start from the beginning, i would start by just placing your hand in the cage and let your hand just stay there motionless. Even if he nips at you, don't twitch. My newest gerbils were so fraid of hands, but after a week of just placing my hand in the cage, now they look forward to it, climb all over my hand, and i can move my fingers around now, with out them scattering for safety. If they can learn to trust your hand, everything will go smoothly. <br>  When you pick them up (hopefully after you've tried the dead hand in cage method) and they are still nipping/biting, blow in their faces. Not hard.. they don't seem to like that at all. I haven't had a problem with biting before, but from what i've read nad heard, blowing on them is a simple and humane way of teaching them no. <br>  Another thing you can do is give them more to chew on. Ecotrition chew logs are excellent, cereal boxes cut in half with holes are excellent, toilet paper tubes etc.. this will help them give use to those teeth. <br>  Good Luck!|`|1dqYorceaa	When I first got gerbils one of them nipped me when holding it due to the bigger gerbil bullying him (in a way).<br>  Are you sure your holding him or her right?<br>  The best thing to do is keep your hands cupped and do not chase your gerbil around the cage when trying to pick him or her up, as this can frighten your gerbil. The best way to pick a gerbil up is to cup your hands under the gerbil gently and pick him or her up. You should keep your hand in the gerbil cage for about a minute so they know your hands are in there and they get used to your scent, then after a few times of doing that try picking them up.<br>  I suggest you don't use gloves because your gerbil may try to chew on them and this may make him poorly.<br>  I hope this works for you. :)|`|oUbBOeCoaa	make sure that you wash your hands before you handle your gerbil because if your fingers smell of food then your gerbil might mistake your finger for some food. if you have just got him then he probably is just a little afraid because he's in a new environment and you just need to give him time. maybe leave him for a day or two, and then after that just go up to him in the cage and just lay your hand on the bottom of the cage so that your gerbil can get used to your hand and can see that you are not a threat. then if he seems okay with your hand in the cage then try to stroke him (not pick up) keep doing this until he seems comfortable with you and then you can try to handle him. they can sense when you are nervous so try to stay calm. hold him near to floor so that if he gets scared and bites you and you drop him or if he gets nervous and trys to jump out of your hand then he doesnt have a long way to fall. hope this helps, good luck x|`|jpS9wgu8aa	place your hand in the cage and don't move around. let them get use to your scent again and the presents of your hand. and then in a few days put a treat in your hand. let them come to you. don't go to them. Gerbils haven't been domesticated half as long as mice and rats. only within the past 50 yrs gerbils have been sold as pets because they are a desert rodent unlike mice and rats which have been sold as pets for hundreds of yrs. and keep in mind gerbils natural predators, hawks and other predatory birds. so reaching your hand in to grab one in their mind is a predator going after them which may lead them to bite.<br>  <br>  so just place your knuckles on the bedding with your palm up and just hang out for a while. let them come to you and investigate. and then add a treat. and in time they'll get use to you again. this has to be a daily practice though. and after they get use to you again you can't forget about them. you must give them attention every day.|`|yjssy945aa	It's agitated. Don't wake him up if he is sleeping, don't try to grab him, wash your hands clean of any food smell and just put your hand in the cage and let him come to you. They get very testy if you invade their personal space, lol :)|`|GjqqXANdaa	KILL IT

B1OUPWxXaa	Well they don't always suffer but try to minimize the time there because even though they might make new friends, they might get separation anxiety or they might turn against you. They don't always feel abandoned if they are preoccupied with their new doggie friends.|`|AA12128656	i think doggie daycare is frivolous and teaches dogs to never relax and chill the hell out. <br>  dogs need to learn NOT to have separation anxiety.<br>  they don't suffer at the daycare, but i don't think they gain much.<br>  <br>  and it's just my personal opinion that i REALLY don't like someone else handling my dogs.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	I agree with both Bozema and DeeDawg - some dogs like it, some don't. Dogs can learn bad behaviors in a daycare that isn't well run and very structured. Regardless, I don't believe dogs actually think they have been left by their owner, never to return. That would require an awareness of the future which dogs don't possess.<br>  <br>  Finally, I must correct something. "Abundant" means plentiful. I believe you meant "abandoned." Quite a different meaning!!|`|yPhCujOvaa	I think it really depends on the situation.  If you're doing it every day, it might be a different story.  I've only done it a couple of times, on the weekend when I've had something to do, but I think my dog loves it.  I thought of it in two ways.  One: would she rather play with other dogs all day, learning social behavior and getting plenty of exercise or sit in a crate with a nylabone and a kong?  Two: isn't it a little like sending a child to recess in kindergarten?<br>  <br>  The dog comes back pooped (forgive the pun, but she has already pooped and is tired!) and generally seems very happy.  Since sending her to doggie day care, I honestly think she has learned some social skills and is less stressed when meeting new dogs.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Dogs that go there are far from suffering.  But it is true that some dogs don't like it - they aren't social with other dogs, are fearful or find it overwhelming.  Other dogs love it.  The key is knowing your dog and making sure it is a positive experience for them.|`|AA10229248	HA! My dog used to drag me into the building and not even look at me when I left. He couldn't WAIT to get to daycare and play with his buddies.|`|76V3OKALaa	no they know that they get to play and at the end of the day they get to go home.
6eqJSffkaa	Your cats are still young and are being kittenish in their behavior, given time they will settle down, so be patient and don't even think of getting rid of them!<br>  <br>  One tip if your cat is jumping on a surface you don't like for example, is to give it a quick hiss.  This is very effective and in no way unkind if done at the right moment, don't hiss after the event because the cat won't be able to connect the sound with the behavior.<br>  <br>  In the resource box below I list a site that if you clck on it at the top right hand corner you will find very useful tips and information to help with the cats behavioral problems and litter training.<br>  <br>  All the best and good luck with them|`|33cb11963f21d301c52b7556d817e621aa	They are still very young, and so it is not surprising that the two of them get up to all sorts of mischief together. They should calm down as they get older but at the moment you need some respite. Is there any way you could let them outside to play - perhaps in an outdoor run to keep them safe? If not, perhaps you could dedicate a room to them in your home, where they could play freely and not upset you - a utility/laundry room for example. Good luck!|`|4JFwnmqVaa	One thing for sure they will eventually grow out of this stage and become loving all the time. <br>  The spray water trick does work.|`|QxMsReIHaa	What about search for some professional help to teach them or let them grow a little bit more because as cats grew older, they will slowly start to behave.|`|kC7U3VK8aa	i have two young cats also and mine are wild at times, i think its just cos they are still kittens, theyll grow out of it, its just there way of getting rid of all there pent up energy|`|CaPZrWVWaa	Spray water at them will keep them off of where you don't want them to go. You can even get them to stop scratching up things. Make sure to say there name and 'no' in a loud, stern voice to verbally train then as well. <br>  <br>  If their play fighting is getting out of control, after they run by, closing they door of they room they run into will stop them in their tracks. They will then settle down.<br>  <br>  I have a large bath mat under the litter. He seems to want to mark the  box and the small area around it. Throwing poo around was something young boys grow out of.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	they are still very young with lots of energy, all you can do is make sure they have lots of toys and scratching posts but you also need to teach them some manners and set boundries by stopping them everytime they do something wrong. i would only have one litter tray, that could give your cat the idea they can go anywhere by having 3. honestly they will calm down in time
lt1nxKKXaa	Your 16, and going to college.You are independent to make some decisions of your own.Get a job,and save up some money to get your dream puppy.But where is it going to stay is the big question.Your mom doesn't want that responsibility.What parent would?You should consider waiting,so when you get out of college he or she will have a place to stay,and the right amount of attention it needs as well.With studies and fun you will not have the time to take proper care for he or she.<br>  <br>  P.S. Good luck|`|aYn9xIaCaa	I would say no, there isn't a way to convince her. She has very good reasons to not let you have a dog. You just need to realize that this isn't a good point in your life to be entering into a 12-20 year relationship with an animal. Also, when you take an animal to a different country they usually have quarantine times, and you seriously would not want to do that to a puppy.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Those reasons DO and SHOULD matter and it just proves that your mom is making the right decision.<br>  <br>  YOU want a dog - your mom doesn't!  Why should she be stuck with the responsibility of paying and caring for it?<br>  <br>  Honestly, you sound like a spoiled brat.|`|qw33YLXraa	Your mom is doing the right thing. You need to think of a dogs well being, they are a comitment for life, not just when it's fun or convient.|`|EUs5QAQ8aa	Hey if u convince her i hav an adorible purebred chihuahua. 11 weeks old.. Email me:<br>  Mrs_arvizu@yahoo.com|`|TOa0zULNaa	try to convince her as best as u can|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Those reasons matter a lot.  She will be doing most of the work with this dog, it's not fair to either of them.  If you move to another country, it's going to be a long expensive process to get your dog through customs.  Her concerns are legitimate.  Be mature and wait until your life is stable enough to handle owning a dog.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	she wont get one because while your at college she will be stuck looking after it, paying the vets bills ect
DpNk8ZpLaa	Okay, first of all -- and I know this can not be helped right now -- no one had any business taking that puppy away from his mother and litter mates at 5-7 weeks.  This is often the source of all kinds of bad behavior.  That is the time that the puppy is learning socialization from his mother and litter mates.<br>  <br>  This puppy is probably beginning to teeth, so he is testing his news teeth on you and other things.  The key is to keep appropriate teething material around at all times.  Just like with human babies, try something cold.  It can be magic to sore gums.  One of his rawhide chews, or nylon bones popped into the freezer for a while.  (Make sure it isn't something that will turn brittle and shatter from the cold either in the freezer or in his mouth.)<br>  <br>  I find the muzzle handshake the very best method for dealing with unwanted mouthing behavior.  On a pup this little, you will need to be especially gentle and careful.  When the pup does something you don't like, you take the muzzle and gently but firmly give it *one* shake, much like a handshake in grip and in motion.  No vigorous shaking of the pup, no raised voice, no drama.  Muzzle shake and a firm, calm and quiet "No!"<br>  <br>  Then just continue on with your normal business.  Dogs have very short attention spans, so when it's over it's just over. |`|efT9NtJaaa	First, get a trainer to help.  It might take a while to undo a bad habit.  Second, every-time you see him rip up the carpet, say "No rip" or something and offer him a toy.  He might need more exercise, too.|`|cZKIQqn3aa	Well, I am 11 and this is my mom's account. We have a six month old Mastiff and this is what we do with him. First, you must say no more firmly and maybe hit him on the snout. not too hard, but hard enough that he knows he has done something wrong and needs to stop. But keeping him busy with toys to chew on is very good. Hope this helps.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Don't slowly withdraw.  Squeal and quickly withdraw, then walk away for a minute.  This will take several times.  <br>  <br>  As for tearing up carpet, make sure he has things he can chew on, things for puppies that are hard to help with teething, etc. and put vinegar on the carpet.  If that doesn't work, just make sure he can't get to that part of the carpet.  <br>  <br>  Edit: Watch "It's Me or the Dog".|`|AZCtkVmtaa	If he is getting rough and won't calm down a time out may be in order.  grab him by the scruff and firmly say no. do not shake him or pick him up while doing it though, then put him in his crate if he does it again for a few minutes. We put some hot sauce on the carpet where our puppy was chewing it. The hotter the better and then when he chews it he will burn his tongue and not want to repeat the behavior again

Todos los animales entienden, luego de que pasan un "proceso de acostumbramiento" que le llaman aprendizaje, las personas a diferencia de los animales entieneden (razonan) lo bueno de lo malo, los animales (no racionales) no, por tanto un animal prueba muchas veces las reacciones que le devuelven y emite una respuesta que a nuestros sentidos se refleja como entender. Por tanto ellos se dan cuenta que algunas personas son mas accesibles que otras, por la vibracion de los sonidos de la voz, por el olor que despedimos, por gestos que hacemos. Esta bueno que tu perrita "entienda", eso significa que tiene un trato de jerarquia para con vos, no sera asi para con otras personas. mucha suerte con ella y que la disfrutes como ella lo hace con vos...|`|4FuOnZxYaa	claro qe entiendes solamente <br>  qe ellos captan la informacion <br>  mas lentamente qe nosotros <br>  ellos tienen un coeficiente de <br>  un ni?o de entre los 3 a los 7 <br>  a?os asi qe tampoco le pidas <br>  demasiado a tu mascotta <br>  buen dia y saludos byeee.|`|7M9Sh9buaa	yo pienso que si entienden de alguna manera u otra lo que les uqieres decir pero segun expertos solo actuan segun instintos y conductas aprendidas con el tiempo|`|8YqBbH6Zaa	claro que entienden se de perros ciegos que se guian por la voz y si les dices sientate se sienta|`|AFBlj5bMaa	Los animales entienden.  <br>  <br>  No se si haz tenido la oportunidad de leer pero si he visto articulos en donde mencionan que en promedio los perros tienen una inteligencia comparada con ni?os de 2 a?os de edad y que en perros como el border collie se compara como la de un ni?o de 4 a?os y que hasta pueden reconocer el significado de unas 400 palabras.<br>  <br>  Lo unico que pienso es que nosotros no sabemos como desarrollar al limite su inteligencia pq si los pusieramos en clases de entrenamiento y esas cosas de seguro nos sorprenderian muchisimo mas.|`|AnojKwGiaa	Por supuesto, los perritos son super listos, mi perrita es super entendida, obediente y mi mejor compa?erita, pues ella no me resonga, siempre me perdona, nadie me hace tanta fiesta cuando me ve como ella somo si no me hubiera visto en a?os, y a mas de eso obedece a si que si, si entieneden|`|DXcuZPT4aa	Me parece que nos entienden a veces...Quizas la coca hizo efecto en mi.La coca-cola...|`|PLYX103saa	CLARO LO QUE PASA ES QUE NOSOTROS NO LOS ENTENDEMOS!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  pero existe la inteligencia emocional,  el lenguaje no esta solo determinado por las palabras, las palabras es lo mas reciente en comunicacion en todo la historia de esta humanidad, antes, para comunicarnos, teniamos nuestro instinto animal de sobreviviencia, y es algo que aun tenemos, pero menos desrrollado, por que nuestras necesidades son muy diferentes en estos tiempos.<br>  <br>  y es un conductor que nos permite llevarnos bien con nuestras mascotas sin que tengamos que mediar palabras.<br>  <br>  exitos .|`|XLZNoZThaa	entienden a su due?o.

I live with a dog in an apartment, but the dog doesn't go in the bedrooms during the day, just the living room, kitchen and balcony.  I assume by terrace you mean a large open space similar to a garden, so I think your dog would be fine.

What is the question?|`|Hwybmzg5aa	no the breeds you said are not good apartment dogs they all have a lot of energy need loads of exercise and a big yard.if you really want a good apartment dog get a pug,Chihuahua,bichon,toy poodle,Miniature poodle or small terrier there all good apartment dogs and if you want three buy one at a time.if you do not buy one at a time you will have a lot of work on your hands.three puppies ah scary to much work.|`|7lQylFnyaa	What? why would you wanna get three at once?<br>  <br>  Trust me just get one doggie and maybe a smaller one.<br>  If you got three dogs barking at all hours your neighbours would soo complain and they would require constant attention and may fight eachother if they got bored.<br>  <br>  Obviously you shuld do what you like but i really really recomend you just get one small dog. It would be so silly to get three big dogs.|`|6ApIp7Ryaa	You want to have three large dogs in an apartment with no garden?<br>  Are you thinking of the dogs quality of life or your own? <br>  <br>  Sure you can take them for walks when you are home, but when you are out are they going to be locked inside an apartment?<br>  <br>  They are also all working breeds, which means without proper mental stimulation they will get bored and destructive. <br>  <br>  Also do you have a body corporate who has a policy on dogs in apartments? It would be hard to hide from anyone one of those dogs, let alone three.
25cd367493004c22f4ecd5ac5f3d3d1aaa	Well, first of all, you should of been a little more careful of where you left things. But it's ok. Wait and see what will happen.There just might be a little dhiarrea. If you don't want to wait you should really call a veteranarian. Just keep a real good eye on your dog. I hope nothing happens to her. Good Luck. :-)|`|erSxgMQ2aa	If your dog only had a lick of it chances are pretty good she will be fine. However, if she is showing signs of intoxication such as vomiting diarrhea, quivering, drop or rise in temperature I HIGHLY suggest you take her to an emergency animal hospital immediately. It is the theobromine in chocolate that causes the reaction in animals and if your dog is small and had large amounts of the chocolate then she needs to be brought into a clinic so a vet can look at her as soon as possible. |`|XzjWHVR2aa	most dogs are lactose intollerent just keep an eye on him he may get diarrhea but that is the worst of if usually but if he is not acting right take him to the vet some dog vomite as well but since it was not pure chocolate and probably not a large amount he should be fine|`|Pg6I1Tbzaa	just monitor him, most likely nothing, maybe runny poo but nothing serious.<br>  if you are worried  you can call your vet for some advice.|`|crPu1i6jaa	Depensd how mutch.<br>  Most likly nothing but if you seen unusal things in your dog call the vet ASAP.<br>  Good luck and I hope your dog will be ok.|`|25c833bc5ac493c64cf44974c6303f49aa	your dog will be ok, however you shouldn't let them eat chocolate it really isn't good for them. call your vet, i'm sure they will tell you the same thing|`|riKpdUcnaa	it depends how much they have if they have alot than ......take them to the vet if its not alot then they will be fine|`|29IEIFLsaa	If he gets sick...

Depending on how much he ate and the size of your dog depends on how sick your dog will get. <br>  <br>  Knowing which chocolate is the most toxic is important, but leaves one wondering how much must be eaten to poison a dog. The list in this box should be helpful. Maybe you can clip it and post it on your refrigerator? <br>  <br>  <br>  White chocolate: 200 ounces per pound of body weight. It takes 250 pounds of white chocolate to cause signs of poisoning in a 20-pound dog, 125 pounds for a 10-pound dog. <br>  Milk chocolate: 1 ounce per pound of body weight. Approximately one pound of milk chocolate is poisonous to a 20-pound dog; one-half pound for a 10-pound dog. The average chocolate bar contains 2 to 3 ounces of milk chocolate. It would take 2-3 candy bars to poison a 10 pound dog. Semi-sweet chocolate has a similar toxic level. <br>  Sweet cocoa: 0.3 ounces per pound of body weight. One-third of a pound of sweet cocoa is toxic to a 20-pound dog; 1/6 pound for a 10-pound dog. <br>  Baking chocolate: 0.1 ounce per pound body weight. Two one-ounce squares of bakers' chocolate is toxic to a 20-pound dog; one ounce for a 10-pound dog. <br>   <br>  |`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Chocolate ice cream is not the same as a dog eating chocolate.<br>  What will happen?  Nothing.  <br>  What should happen?  You should be more careful about leaving things around where the dog can get them.
vm7ks1kzaa	My cats drink out of our glasses and no matter what we do they wont stop. They usually just try to drink milk (bad for them!) and water. The water isn't so bad.<br>  <br>  Don't let your cat drink coke...it could be bad for them. We caught one of ours drinking vodka and coke last night! So coke must be a cat thing!<br>  <br>  Just keep saying no and putting her down..sorry i'm not much help and i doubt she will stop. Just make sure she has fresh water in a bowl 24/7|`|VMY7No0eaa	You can get coasters ... just put one on the TOP of the glass.<br>  It might be a NEW thing... and since she is a kitten you have to break the habbit now.<br>  you can get one of those fountains for her that might be what she is looking for.  <br>  <br>  I don't think coke will hurt her other than make her hyper.<br>  good luck |`|3GAiVmEAaa	Coke is VERY bad for cats- caffeine is dangerous.

Something almost like an air horn.  Whenever you see your cat going near cups or glass's, use the horn / loud sound.  <br>  <br>  This  has worked for me and my kitten.  He kept trying to eat the food off of my plate.  I  used loud distracting sounds that scared him.  And he quit trying to eat my food.  But keep in mind it doesn't work right away.  It is something you need to keep doing for about a month or so, give or take.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps some.|`|DchAJvVqaa	kittens will eat and drink whatever they can, it's like they are dogs for the first few months.... don't worry, she will grow out of it, but as for the water.. my oldest cat is 7 and she still drinks the water out of our glasses but won't touch anything else.. :)
AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  As several other folks have written, your cat may have an allergy, resulting in itchy ears. This being said, there are other conditions that can cause this problem. <br>  <br>  Your cat may have fleas and is allergic to them. Do be sure that your cat is flea-free and use a flea control product that is safe. Advantage is an excellent method of flea control.<br>  <br>  He may have a yeast infection, or inflamation of the inner portions of the ear.  Here is an excellent article on "itchy" problems with cat's ears, written by a vet.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vetinfo4cats.com/catear.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vetinfo4cats.com/catear.html</a><br>  <br>  Once your cat is thoroughly evaluated, and all the possibilities outlined in the article are negative, then do consult with a veterinary dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association|`|E0U2yII3aa	Food allergy from a food (which you may have changed recently), dry skin, hair that falls towards the inside of the ear, or perhaps even a new mannerism your cat may have developed.|`|FfSEhCARaa	She could be having an allergic reaction to her food. Some pets are allergic to grains. Maybe up the quality of her food. <br>  Her skin could be dry or irritated in that area. Go to a local pet store and ask about that. They won't give you the advice a vet would give, about mites and such, but they'll help you out from experience if it's something less serious. <br>  <br>  I've just started at my pets store so i can't help too much, but I've seen my co-workers solve alot of these sorts of problems.|`|CBNC40sDaa	Well, as long as she does not have ear mites, and she is not damaging her ears from the scratching, then she should be okay.  The air is certainly dry during the Winter, and it might be some basic dry skin around the ears.|`|KOdLWJaQaa	She may have allergies.  My cat seems to do this sometimes as well, but not so bad as I worry about it.  Does she have long hair?  It may be bothering her ears.  I would ask your vet.|`|Qr7cTlFaaa	take her to the vet. maybe fleas|`|FoeyqAZqaa	She could have fleas on her ears. Or it could be dry skin.|`|2PTG2YqCaa	Maybe, take her to the vet, they could probaly find out what it is.  Or get a cone.<br>  <br>  -Ozzy
3giaPYe8aa	No matter what the breed of dog, the whole digestive process takes approx.24 hours.  So, if you feed him at 7:00 a.m. today, the excrement of that meal will be approx. 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.  The food does not go straight through, as some people seen to think.
b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	There is only one way to get a tape worm and that is to eat a FLEA, which has eaten a tapeworm egg. <br>  <br>  The only way for a animal, or human to get tapeworms is to ingest a flea that has ingested a tapeworm egg. There is no other way. The flea eating the egg activates the egg... which then hatches in your cat's intestine after the cat ingests the flea. <br>  <br>  You have to eat the host (flea)... not the egg. So... somewhere... you have a flea. <br>  <br>  You will need a wormer from your vet to kill the tapeworms. I recommend Drontal. You will also need to treat your cat for fleas because that is where the tape worm came from. I recommend a Capstar pill to kill all the fleas instantly, and then a dose of Frontline Plus to prevent re-infestation.<br>  <br>  Do NOT use OTC wormers. They are not safe and can kill your cat. Not to mention they don't work very well. Wormer is a pesticide after all, so don't be cheap. Do what is safe and buy from your vet.|`|4aAhEK9daa	The tapeworm is actually ONE worm.  What you're seeing are just SEGMENTS of the worm called "proglottids".  A tapeworm is a parasite with a head (the "scolex") that suctions onto the inside of the cat's stomach or intestines.  It then grows these segments - each with male and female sex organs and capable of reproducing.  The worm segments tend to die within a few seconds of exposure to air but since poop is moist they can often survive a bit longer in the litterbox.  Which is why if you have multiple cat and one's got a tapeworm and the other doesn't be sure to scoop the poop EVERY time the infected cat goes.  I had a dog years ago with tapeworm and once he was treated the entire worm came out - about three feet long.  I almost puked it was so disgusting.  A large amount of segments can also come out at a time if the worm has grown to such a size that there's no more room in the stomach.  <br>  <br>  You haven't mentioned whether you're treating this cat or not.  Having a tapeworm can make a cat VERY sick as it deprives the cat of nutrition.  If you haven't yet done so get the cat to the vet so he can give you the right medicine to kill the worm.  And get your cat on a regular flea treatments (Advantage, Frontline) as this is how cats get tapeworm.  Fleas can have the larvae of the tapeworm inside them and when the cat grooms itself it can swallow one of these fleas.|`|td9geYIVaa	Just because the tapeworm has came out of your cat/dog doesent mean that its gone, there could be many inside of him/her and wat came out of him/her may of just been one of there eggs or one of the sigaments that fall off of them And they die relitively quick after leaving an alive body, and no it doesent matter on the size of the animal/human, they can grow to meters no matter wat size of the body there in.|`|QxMsReIHaa	No, tapeworm sizes are vary depending to its species, not the size of the animal and yes, they could be re-infested if they ate the worm because tapeworm is made of many segments. And each segment has an egg of those tapeworms.
qUTlJQOgaa	My Cocker Spaniel use to do this too. He did this when my husband and I were not home also. My husband and I started frequently (once an hour when we were home) taking him out so this didn't happen and when he went to the bathroom outside we gave him a treat. When we weren't home we put him in his kennel. We slowly progressed to two hours and so forth. He finally went back to his routine. Scolding a dog sometimes just doesn't help, they sometimes just don't know that it is wrong to go inside house. Also, she may be smelling her feces left on the carpet even if it is cleaned up and that could be causing her to go there over and over again.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	I don't know if 3 times a day is enough really.  Mine goes out way more than that.  Maybe the times you're taking her out don't coincide with the times she has to go so maybe take her out more often.|`|1U88DGBQaa	try crate training|`|4D4EAvpHaa	Something outside may have scared her before and because of it she doesn't want to be out there. My dog's done the u-turn thing a lot, mainly at night when it's dark or rainy. I have to stay out with her at times like this.<br>  <br>  I'd say you should be stern with her when she turns around, lead her out to the grass where she should be going, stay outside with her, and don't let her in until she's gone. If it IS something bothering her outside it may help to know that you're there.<br>  <br>  It also might have something to do with the other dog, if they don't get along.|`|6b0byLETaa	you should count how much time is between herwashrrom times and whenever it' 30 minutes to 1 hour before put her in a cage with pads and wait|`|pZAmfDBMaa	Hmm. This is going to sound odd but she may be angry at you for something. I'm not kidding, when an animal is angry at it's owner they do things they know they aren't supposed to. Cats more so than dogs but dogs do it too. Or she could have encountered something outside that has scared her, therefore refusing to go out. It sounds like you are doing everything that needs to be done though. If you're taking her out 3 times a day then there's not much else. My advice is to keep taking her out and when you get out the door pet her and let her know there's nothing to be afraid of.

Questo comporta il fatto che la gatta poi sarebbe più tranquilla e starebbe più volentieri in casa|`|LShRo6KGaa	Dunque, se vuoi sterilizzare la gattina il costo dovrebbe aggirarsi intorno ai 50 euro. Non so se la asl lo fa ancora gratuitamente e in che casi. Per uqnato riguarda il post operazione bisogna stare attenti che non si lecchi i punti e che non li apra. Una semplice fascia a rete di quelle che mettiamo anche noi andrà bene. La mia non sopportava il collare elisabettiano e se l'è tolto ma è stato meglio. Fai bene a farlo. Oltre ad evitare tantiìssimi rischi anche per la salute della gattina, eviti anche di far procreare altri gattini.

Lei era digiuna dalla sera prima. Alle 18.00 sono andata a riprenderla. Era già completamente sveglia, con nessun sintomo residuo dell'anestesia. Le faceva solo un po' male il taglio e quindi non sapeva in che posizione stare. Alla notte l'ho lasciata a casa di mia mamma perchè in casa ho un altro gattino un po' agitato e avevo paura che le desse noia (per lei era comunque un posto conosciuto, è cresciuta là). Ogni giorno le dovevo dare l'antibiotico (una pastiglia che lei comunque mangiava dalla mia mano) e disinfettarle il taglio con acqua e amuchina. Dopo 10 giorni le hanno tolto i punti. Comunque già dal pomeriggio del giorno dopo era tranquillissima, correva e giocava come se nulla fosse stato!!!<br>  <br>  L'operazione a me è costata 120 euro, comprese due visite di controllo.|`|1G3QyyZsaa	<a href="http://www.gattiandcats.it/Riproduzione/Riproduzione.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gattiandcats.it/Riproduzione/...</a><br>  prova qui se non trovi quello che cerchi avvisami;<br>  intanto io continuo a cercare.|`|97gP2gSoaa	Assolutamente d'accordo sulla sterilizzazione...<br>  secondo me un gatto non modifica la sua natura dopo la sterilizzazione, nn è vero che ingrassa (dipende da quanto e cosa gli dai da mangiare, se fa moto ecc) <br>  La sterilizzazione non può fargli che bene... anzi ti suggerisco di farla anche all'altro gatto...<br>  Quando abitavo con i miei avevo quattro gatti...<br>  Ora che convivo... ne ho 5... 3 femmine e 2 maschi...<br>  tutti sterilizzati...<br>  ti dico che un gatto che è spiritato lo sarà anche dopo l'intervento, uno che è sedentario lo sarà anche dopo (con la conseguenza che si allarga :) )<br>  E' importante valutare anche il fatto se il gatto è abituato a uscire di casa, in questo caso la sterilizzazione non può fargli altro che bene... niente litigi (o almeno molti meno) e quindi meno possibilità di prendere malattie...<br>  per il prezzo dipende dai veterinari, ma siamo nell'ordine di quello che ti hanno detto sopra...<br>  <br>  :)|`|SQMlz1y0aa	dunque, mia mamma è veterinaria e di gatti ne ho visti parecchi....sostanzialmente non cambia nulla nel comportamento del gatto se non, in alcuni casi, che ingrassa un po' (è abbastanza normale) io ho due gatte, una è rimasta assolutamente identica a prima ma cmq varia a seconda dell'animale. se sterilizzi la femmina , se verranno tolte le ovaie non andrà più in calore, se verranno solo legate le tube (che non è una gran cosa anche perchè può comportare problemi in futuro) invece potrà ancora...ehm....."divertirsi". questa scelta cmq varia da veterinario a veterinario. l'inervento costa circa 100 euro.|`|SmFWfCnhaa	costa circa 100 euro sterizzare le gattine, ma so che anche al canile li sterilizzano gratuitamente, solo che devi fargli credere che è randagia.

ZwP8eP3naa	Hai fatto la cosa migliore, nemmeno io avrei avuto il coraggio di lasciare la micetta al freddo.

Fai sterilizzare Micia, altrimenti ti ritrovi con una cucciolata intera di micetti che non sai a chi dare. Vedrai che in poco tempo invece di fare la guerra faranno all'Ammore!!!! ;-) Scherzo!

You need to teach her recall. The best way to do that is to have two people. One person gently holds the dogs collar until the other one calls the dog. When the dog goes to the person they should give her a treat. Something really delicious. Then the first person should do the same thing, call the dog and when she gets to them treat her. Initially, start out a few feet apart then move further away from each other. Use an excited ,happy voice when you say come. Start by practicing inside the house. When you do practice outside make sure you are in a completely fenced in area. Never call the dog to you to scold her or do something she may not like such as nail trimming. You want the word come to be associated with good things. If you really want success with this you should try clicker training. You can learn online at www.pawsawhilevtc.com

They are intelligent and enjoy obedience, and are even starting to show up in dog sports, such as agility. They are still small dogs though, and fragile, so I wouldn't recommend them with young children. They love attention and look so graceful when they move, with their long, flowing coats (which are not incredibly hard to care for).<br>  <br>  All up, a beautiful, intelligent dog, reasonably easy to take care of, and adaptable - if you want an exercise partner, they will do their best to keep up, and if you want a lapdog, they are perfect.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ckGSIYJJaa	I would describe Papillons as being constantly alert, upbeat, and ready to do anything type of dog.  They are energetic and bold.  They love, love, lover interacting with people so they thrive in homes that spend a lot of time with them, training them, and playing with them.  They excel in agility and obedience because under the fro-fro dog is a true working animal.  They are very affectionate with their person, friendly with strangers, but most prefer to be playing and training than being pet and cuddled with.  They are perfect companions for someone who likes the traits of a big dog but wants it in a smaller package.  <br>  <br>  From good breeding lines, they tend to be long lived (14 yrs being the norm) and healthy.  They suffer from few hereditary conditions and those that afflict the breed are seldom life threatening.  They do require brushing and bathing to look their best, but they don't need any professional grooming.  They do require dental care because their small mouths make them highly prone to periodontal disease which could lead to major health problems if not addressed.  Simple brushing on a regular basis or veterinary dentals should solve the problem.  <br>  <br>  They can be a bit too hyper for some homes and when lacking stimulation and training, they can become aggressive and annoying.  They do bark and because of their small size coupled with high metabolism, they need frequent potty breaks making housebreaking a big challenge unless you can accommodate them with a litter box.  <br>  <br>  You can read more up on the breed at :  www.PapillonInformation.com <br>  <br>  You can find breeders at : www.PapillonClub.org<br>  <br>  take care,
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	You can begin by putting the ferret in a cage and having the dog around it.  If he shows hunt/attack behaviors, correct him.  Do this over an extended period of time until the dog ignores the cage/ferret.  Then, having dog on a leash and held by another person, take the ferret out and hold him, once again correcting the dog for any inappropriate behavior.  Gradually, you can let the ferret roam, while the dog is restrained and someone giving corrections.  At the end of this, you may have trained your dog to ignore the ferret.  But, usually, it's really not a good idea to have a ferret-interested dog and the fert together (never a good idea to tempt fate :)).  Hope this helps!|`|RZzMse3Haa	Have the ferret in a cage that protects it from the dog but is open enough for the dog to smell it and see it.<br>  <br>  Dogs are all about smell. Once the dog gets used to his smell, then he is likely to be more friendly.  Then you can try introducing them without th cage and just pay it by ear at that point.|`|SdS9Qcayaa	how u introduce ur dog to ur ferret is u hold ur ferret making sure u can move quick if u have to then u slowly call ur dog making him sit every few feet this will let ur dog know that u r serious about his behaviour and will correct him if he misbehaves a firm no if he grawls or shows teeth and another sit stay repeat this a few times and things should get better, don't leave ur dog and ur ferret unattended that is never a good idea, if ur dog is a trained one u can let him sit in the room and watch ur cats interact with ur ferret soon he will want to join in the fun but becareful if ur dog's tail is down or his ears r back don't let him approach make him sit stay it is not uncommon for some dogs to not like ferrets so if u see in a few days there is no change then u'll have to keep them separated. i have 4 ferrets and all my other pets get along with them except my pit bull sadie would never hurt my ferrets but will let them know they r to close with a quick arff i hope this helps good luck and congrats on ur new little ferret baby boy|`|WSKHiBngaa	I had to put my ferret in a ball the first 3 hours.

90eb3261d19f6e7756d3a922d5299f84aa	From looking at the pictures...You are correct in your assumption.Only females will bare stripes on the underside of their tail after their first molt which usually occurs around 6-8 months. Since both have the stripes and you have had them this long the chances of one being a male is unlikely. Another you can do is check the spacing of their hips. This might be difficult but a female cockatiel will have a bigger space between the hips for when she lays eggs. But if you can see a major difference...well you know. haha. The only way to be 100% sure is to take them to your local avian vet to get DNA tested. Its quick and easy and you will have your answer if not that day then the next. Normally this costs around $50 but may be more or less. You can also order a free kit to take blood samples that you send for testing. You will recieve a card that you put dots of your cockatiels blood which you can get by taking him to get his nails clipped at a petstore and they can clip into the quick and put it on the card. Then you send the card in. Now it does cost $15 for the results but like i said the kit itself is free. We did this with our African Gray. If your interested in that then go to www.healthgene.com   GOOD LUCK   hope I helped|`|LkdZPgvjaa	I've had the pleasure of knowing 5 cockatiels and from what I've read and learned about these wonderful birds, it's not important whether their wings are spotted or not, it's the tail feathers - bars on the outside tail feathers usually point to the bird being a female; males that have the wild gray color usually will have more yellow on their heads ... usually.  I've found the behavior to be more of an indication of male/female.  Males tend to be more outgoing, friendly and curious.  Female cockatiels tend to vocalize only one "chirp" sound and will usually not learn to imitate any other sounds, but this is not set in stone.  Males will have lots of vocalizations, can learn to talk and imitate whatever sounds they hear.  I had a male that whistled all day long.  He was just about to learn the 1st stanza of Yankee Doodle when he flew off... bless his little heart (a window screen in my bird room unfortunately warped and opened - I lost 9 birds as well as a big chunk of my heart).   I couldn't tell much from your photos but since you say they both have barred tails, chances are you have 2 females.  Do either of them whistle or make any other sounds other than the chirp?  I had a female that was very bold, extremely friendly and would fly to greet me whenever I was near her, and she would chirp all day long.  No variation though.  If your two only chirp and not whistle or have any other vocalization, chances are they're both female.  Hope this helps.|`|Sh0IBwClaa	from what ive heard, Bright stronger orange=male. duller fainter orange=female. But I would have them feather sexed(for the DNA, a lab can do this for you. either ask your vet or a pet store where this can be done)|`|4RhPa8raaa	ask an avian vet, they will probably know. also males colors tend to be brighter than females|`|WCqJc9sZaa	The male cockatiel will wolf whistle. The female will absolutely not do this. <br>  <br>  There are always exceptions to "the rules" when it comes to using markings to determine sexes.<br>  <br>  However, it appears that you have a male and female, according to the behavior you have described as well as the cheek markings.<br>  <br>  Please note, however, the age of the birds can make it difficult to determine sex.<br>  <br>  Because you bought them when they were 12 weeks old, you should have a male and female because they should have their "somewhat permanent" coloring.<br>  <br>  Important: The wolf whistling is a dead give away that a cockatiel is a male. This sounds like when a guy whistles at a girl!|`|fc1A4767aa	Normally barring indicates a female, however with all the color "morphs" out that is no longer the case 100% of the time. I have known male birds that have barring.<br>  <br>  Behavior is an important indicator, but so is size. I can't tell from the angle of your photographs, but female birds are *always* wider in the body than the males, since they are the ones that do the egg laying. If Oriel is indeed male and Pipi is female, I would expect that Pipi would have a slightly wider body--which is more noticeable in front, around the chest/shoulders--than Oriel.

Look at your pup and slide your hand along her belly. If you find a little bump, that's a hernia.  It's almost where your belly button would be.  That can be fixed with surgery, even the same time you take her in to get spayed. If you don' find a hernia, I suggest contacting your breeder and asking them what exactly everything means on the papers.<br>  <br>  * ADD<br>  <br>   Ok sorry I thought your pup was a girl >_<  <br>  You can wait until your pup gets neutered, that way he only has to be under anesthesia once.  Sometimes hernias will close on their own, but if they don't it's no big deal.  The vet can just snip and stitch and it's closed! Where I work we charge an extra 40 dollars to fix it.  It takes a small amount of time compared to a neuter or spay. It's not an emergency, so don't worry too much.  I hope that answers everything!|`|8NSh1D4Maa	It's DHLPP, I think, just the person who wrote it has bad penmanship and ran the letters together- that's the abbreviation for the diseases the vaccine protects against.

y0cbLn0Yaa	That can happen.  When I bought my Belgian Shepherd Malinois puppy from a breeder in Queensland she registered all the puppies at once into the new owner's names.  It did take a few weeks for the registration papers to come through.<br>  <br>  Having said that I did know that the breeder was a reputable breeder having been involved with Belgian Shepherds since the late 1980's and talking to someone who is into Malinois and knows the breeder personally.<br>  <br>  Did you visit the kennels before you selected the pup or are you having the pup shipped to you.  Does the breeder have a registered Kennel name.   If so, and you have any problems you can always contact the Kennel Club in the state that they are registered in.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|xGedX2rIaa	usually when show people breed they are looking for a dog to show themself. Before 8 weeks it is realy hard to determin show puppies from pet puppies because a lot changes between 6-8 weeks. Because pet puppies are put on the 'limited register' and show puppies are put on the main register, The papers cannot be sent away intill the breeder has chosen the show puppies at 8 -10 weeks. So when the puppy buyers pickup their puppies at 8 weeks the papers have just been sent away. You will get the papers around 4-6 weeks from when you pick up the puppy.<br>  <br>  Oh by the way i live in vic aswell<br>  anymore questions just email me <br>  wild_1_83@hotmail.com
qDhRQxn4aa	Just one question, what dog food is it? Sometimes a dog will eat a food but then it might make them feel sick or not like it. My dog did that. A lot of dog food is made from animal by-products which isn't good for them. Also you don't want to change their food too often, it's also not good for them. Maybe go take him to the vet and get him checked out. That's unusual for a puppy. <br>  <br>  Hope this kinda helped. :D|`|Qc0x3Ldaaa	It is possible that your pup is teething, and just doesn't want to eat much at this point?<br>  I'm wondering about that possibility since you said he did eat his breakfast.|`|Zxg7SfN2aa	your puppy is playing you for a fool <br>  he knows you will give in and spoil him  <br>  if he ate this morning, he will be ok <br>  just make sure the food is availible <br>  but i wouldnt hand feed him <br>  <br>  you could also try a shallower bowl   but he will eat when hes hungry<br>  |`|OS5IvuV5aa	leave the food on the floor... for 15 mins... if he doesn't eat it pick it up... go back in a hour and try it again|`|kDUnhONQaa	It shouldn't worry you too much. No puppy will starve themselves to death.<br>  <br>  Put down his normal amount of food at meal time. Leave it down for fifteen to twenty minutes, then pick it up again. Do not offer him treats or hand feeding until he is eating from his bowl again. He will begin to eat, trust me. Offer his meals at the normal time and try to seclude him to a room (bathroom, laundry room) where he can be alone with his food. It will help keep him focused. Just remember - only fifteen to twenty minutes.<br>  <br>  Good luck! And congrats on the new puppy. =)
25ENsqfEaa	Dogs are situational, so when you are in your room your dog understands that he has to listen.  When you let your dog outside you have a whole new situation.  Instead of letting your dog run free and learn that he doesn't have to listen.  either take your dog out on a leash or a long line (15') and work on calling your dog.  If your dog doesn't respond you have the leash to reel your dog in or the long line.  Until your dog understands that come means come you should not have your dog off leash or off the line.  When your dog comes without you having to reel him in treat your dog.  As far as the sits and downs your dog is still young and could be confused and also could be testing you.  Be patient and if your dog goes down when you say sit help your dog out by placing him in the sit postion.  Do not treat your dog if you have to fix the position.  Only treat when your dog does it correcty himself.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|F03UbGA3aa	Practice Practice Practice.<br>  <br>  Keep trying in different areas and praising him when he does it right.  <br>  <br>  You may want to look into clicker training as well.

Get a lawyer and discuss the repercussions of the situation.|`|QSrmZK6Aaa	Hmm, <br>  <br>  I would personally talk to a lawyer and see what they say..<br>  <br>  I mean for one thing, you were on their property, and the dog was chained… But for another, their dog DID bite you..<br>  <br>  There could be a very thin line between what they can do and not do to you in order to seek reimbursement for their dog..<br>  <br>  Talk to a lawyer, most will give a free consultation.|`|EpMIpm0Eaa	If the dog was attacking you, you had every right to defend yourself.  Take photos of your injuries and call the cops...start a paper trail about the attack on you.  You'll be fine....a pit bull vs a human...a court will always side with you.|`|JKvJmMhnaa	i'm sure there are 2 sides here. a dog will not bite unless it is either human aggressive or it was threatened in some way. So has it ever bitten anyone else? or just you? Go talk to your neighbors.|`|NgZJzEWUaa	What to do?  Get off the computer and find something else to do.<br>  <br>  If a dog bites you, you report it. simple.|`|026407cde2bc8691b34593dbabae7e6eaa	get an attorney?|`|aIfruVoWaa	Counter-sue.  If they try to sue you go for self defense, it was either you or the dog.  Tell them the dog looked bloodthirsty and reacted very aggressive toward you..  Get a note from a Therapist that you developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of the traumatic event.  Most look down at Pit bulls.  They have a bad reputation to begin with because they are breed to fight and sometimes kill.  They are not domesticated no matter what.  If you go to court.  Do research on these type of dogs and show pictures and images on their attacks on others and tell them that you did not want to be another victim.  Tell them you will need the name and number of their homeowners or renters insurance because you are suing for damages to you both physical and emotional.  If they do not have insurance then you will have to sue them personally.  Many homeowner's insurance companies in the United States are reluctant to insure owners of dogs that are considered to be a dangerous breed. So get them for not having insurance on that dog.|`|vUMJKJDbaa	The dog doesnt have "$hitty trainers" because pittbulls are used as gaurd dogs. I know that you were just trying to protect yourself but you should have just slapped it across the face and NOT hard. Dogs are very sensitive and you need to be careful. If you hadnt choked the dog but gave it a slap and ran away to the safest place, then you could have just sued them for not keeping the dog on a leash but otherwise, they have every right to sue you for doing that.<br>  <br>  If you need help (which you asked for) dont get me wrong. IM not acusing you but im just saying what you should have done. Take pictures of your wounds and bring them to court and go to a doctor as well and get it checked. Tell the doctor what happend and he can give you some papers on your wound. <br>  <br>  Thats all the help i can give you but i dont think you can get charged. And dont be to aggressive as they can take the dog to the pound which makes dog owners really upset. I know that you are mad but try to talk it out. And YES they will be acused for letting their dog loose as well.|`|D9zHSj1waa	See, here's the dilemma, you choked the dog but only because  the dog bit you. Its a catch-22. If you go to the authorities, the dog loses. I am assuming you have proof of the bites, like bruising and witnesses at the BBQ.<br>  <br>  Course this is also assuming you did nothing to provoke the dog and have not provoked the dog on previous occasions.|`|gkCkqqHfaa	You have the right to defend yourself.<br>  <br>  WHERE were the owners when their dog was attacking you?   Why didn't they take command of the situation?<br>  <br>  While it is never good to have to hurt an animal - what did they expect you to do when their dog attacked you?<br>  <br>  Let them TRY to sue you ..... no judge in the country will fault you for defending yourself from a vicious dog!!   Be sure to call animal control and file a report against them.|`|gacPwEJ5aa	Pitbulls are bred to fight. What you did was out of self-defence! A lawer would support you in that situation! It's also the dog-owner's fault that they didn't have their mutt tied up, or if it was, not in a small enough area to ensure public safety!<br>  <br>  You should give them the facts about pitbulls and how they are bred to fight. That's why they have been banned from some places in Canada, and maybe other places too!|`|ZcUDzOyzaa	Take pictures of the dog bite and show those in court. You will win because it was self-defense. Their dog should not have bit you, and since it did they should have done something about it. And when they didn't you had to take action. Not your fault, so you have nothing to worry about.|`|DTSvdQkCaa	Hmmm. Did the owners not do anything to try and get the dog off you??<br>  Was this a totally unprovoked attack??<br>  <br>  I can't really comment on what you did as i wasn't there and this is only one side of the situation that is in hand.|`|NtyOWmaHaa	There dog was on their property I guess when this happened.  It is kind of their fault for not coming to your rescue in the first place.  They just need to get another dog if thats the case and maybe this time train it better.|`|bpqGlqVGaa	Why would you have choked it if i where you i would have ran away i hate you and wish for you to be sued !|`|Bk1v1G3Zaa	You should have gotten a police report of the attack and went to the hospital take pics of your wounds for evidences|`|d8AFtMQeaa	Sue them for their Dog biting you.|`|c3UmhtYCaa	EGO MANIAC|`|E5GHfcsaaa	Get a lawyer they love to defend dog bite victims!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	You are a moron.<br>  <br>  Time to move out of your mother's basement.
FHe478Z4aa	Hi, i have a year old male ridgeback & a 12 week female ridgeback & they are such a wonderful breed.  We have them crated at night & when we are not there during the day they are in the garden & they have kennels out there too.  Recently our year old has calmed down a lot already, he has got past the digging stage, the trying to eat stones & sticks stage & doesnt whine, very calm etc, whereas our girl at the moment has to be in everything & everywhere.  Just like with other dogs (and small children) make sure everything is out of their reach that is breakable.  As you have read they are a stubborn, willfull breed (though very intellegent), & they will test you frequently - you must always reinforce you positon in the pack & your dominance.  Make sure you walk through doors first, make him sit & wait for his food, make him walk to heel, make sure you eat your dinner fist before they eat.  training is essential as they are extremley powerful dogs. Our boy (who at the moment weighs 6.5stone)a couple of months ago ran into a man (who i was talking to at the time & and our dogs were playing together) and knocked him flat on his face (he was chasing the other dog).  they have weight & strengh so this needs to be kept in check.  They are very intellegent but will not necessarily do things just to please you- Mac will just look at me & pretend to not hear me ask the most simpliest thing of him.  Becuase of their outstanding growth rate, do not excersie them much in the first 6/8 months, & make sure you play with their ears, mouth, nails & feet everyday while they are small - when they are big & strong day to day stuff & vet visits will be much easier becuase of this. Hardwork & patience & you will be fine.  As for the garden Ridgebacks can clear 6ft when they jump as adults - make sure your fences are high enough.  They are also escape artists - i have heard many stories from other ridgeback owners & still i am amazed when i hear the small gaps they have managed to squeeze through or what they have atually been able to climb!  we have some flower beds, but use an electric wire to prevent him going into them (when he was younger he liked to dig in fluffy soil) apart from that, a couple of toys, water & shelter & a comfortable bed, he should they should be fine.  In the house - because of the domincance issues some experience with Ridgebacks - you may want to limit where he/she is allowed in the house (ie, not up stairs, or on the  sofa etc.)<br>  Just remeber socialisation is key for this breed - so get him/her out & about to see, hear smell & meet everything before its too late & they will be fine.  Have a great time - Ridgebacks are fab!|`|927e0ea12d1dd10da85b6b2b1ad60d02aa	Hi there. I am on my dad's thing but I know alot about dogs. I have some advice. Don't leave your dog in the crate or alone TOO long. They might get mad, and not want to be near you. Also, ALWAYS leave your dog spare water when you leave it alone. They may get thirsty. I have a yellow lab (I bought it!) So, that's my advice for now. No problem.|`|k55kYcCraa	This site covers all these topics on a Rhodesian ridge back:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/rhodesian-ridgeback.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/rhodesian-ridgeback.h...</a><br>  summary<br>  overview<br>  personality<br>  care<br>  feeding<br>  children & other pets<br>  coat, color, & grooming<br>  size<br>  health<br>  history<br>  breed highlights|`|nuXTweA4aa	NOT breed specific!!!<br>  Every pup requires the same care & training & equipment.|`|43JgLpkKaa	they are a great breed , loyal and smart !!  i have a mastiff and a rhodesian ridgeback. both are great dogs and we have raised them together since the mastiff was 4 months and the ridgeback was 2 months.  they think they are the same breed !!!   my ridgeback can be a little on the hyper side, but can be a total couch potato also. when she is outside she will play whatever game you make up with her. a doggier football, catch the dirt piles ,  stalk the moles, whatever !!!   they are very smart dogs, and you will need to obedience train them, they need to be taught how to come and ..leave it .. 2 things they sometimes do not want to do. if they see a animal that is loose or running, they will get sight of it ..and then they are off like a rocket { sight-hounds..gotta love them }  !!!   make sure your puppy comes from a good bloodline, some have  thyroid issues  or dermoid sinus { hope i spelled it right }.  bottom line , they make wonderful additions to a family and they love kids.  good luck.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	Just find a breeder of Ridges.

zYpSMJ25aa	feed her boiled chicken and rice. <br>  her stomach problems should go away after that.|`|I8lFqyyFaa	I'm assuming you meant meat meant for human consumption and not human meat, lol.  Anyhow, any changea in the diet of a dog fed a consistent dog food diet are liable to cause digestive upset (the diarrhea,)  even a change in brand or type of dog food.  Two of mine are sensitive to any diet changes - they have to be introduced very gradually.  Any of those (pork, beef, chicken,) are fine to feed your dog - it's likely the change that's setting her off.  Feed her these things as part of her regular diet, or in very small quantities, or not at all to avoid the upset.|`|AA11757365	You can try some Pepto Bismol, 1/2 to 1 tablespoon every 12 hours for a day or 2. Also, feed a bland diet of boiled ground beef or chicken and rice for 2-3 days. Although Pepto IS safe for dogs, it's always recommended to call your Vet before giving any over the counter medication. In the future, I'd only give give something like boiled chicken as a treat. Fried or baked foods contain grease and seasonings that cause stomach upset. Garlic and onion in any form can irritate the stomach and can be extremely harmful in large quantities. If he's not better by tomorrow, take him to the Vet.|`|AsEQWeilaa	Give her a couple of teaspoons of plain pumpkin puree - NOT pie filling. You can repeat every couple hours until she poops orange (TMI, I know - sorry)  It works great, and dogs love it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dFlF3EHmaa	If she's not accustomed to eating anything other than "pet food" then the change in diet can definitely irritate her system.  Some dogs do fine on "human meat", but only when they are used to it.  Feeding it to them early in their lives helps because their systems are used to it.  <br>  <br>  Changes in diet in any way can upset a dogs stomach.<br>  <br>  FYI, my dogs don't have a problem with most meat....BUT roast beef gives them diarrhea every time...so they don't get it any more.  Don't know why it bothers them, but we don't give it to them for this reason.|`|wjaqQ0IWaa	We never (and I mean never) give our dogs human food. You never know what could happen. Some dogs have really sensitive stomachs/intestines. I would not give her meat anymore until she is better. Take her to the vet if it doesnt clear up, she may have caught something.|`|D33LEMVyaa	A dogs digestive system is different from humans and human food can cause big problems with your pup.  Chicken, beef and pork can be used as treats but don't make them a habit.  NEVER feed grapes, or raisins - they are toxic and can kill your dog! Chocolate can also kill your dog.  <br>  <br>  You r best bet is to feed dog food and treat with dog treats most of the time.<br>  <br>  Search the web for what not to feed your pup.|`|77LdkQkEaa	Most dogs are okay to have a little bit of meat however, it is often richer than their own kibble and so can cause some dogs to get the runs.  <br>  All kibble is a complete diet, so it isn't necessary for her to have anything else but if you want to just give something, giver her very little at first until you make sure her tummy can handle it.  <br>  I do know some dog's who have such sensitive tummies that anything out of the ordinary causes them to be sick.|`|EW4kmox3aa	Cooked meat is fine for dogs but raw is even better. I feed mine raw meat all the time and they could not be healthier. <br>  <br>  I don't feed kibble or canned dog food at all. It doesn't get digested fast enough and slows the dog down.|`|21cZ9v4zaa	Meat is ok to feed her in small amounts but should not have any spices or anything on it as that will upset there stomach.|`|0ySrmnxEaa	Try not to give coco too much of human food it isnt always ggood for all kinds of dogs|`|aSKsDtwLaa	If the meat is very fatty then of course the dog has diarrhea.  She does not need to eat human food.  Look up on-line "things not to feed your dog".  It's an interesting list.|`|TQCzbyenaa	dogs get diarrhea when we switch their food. if you want to feed the human meat.  you can start with small amount with your current dog food and every day increase 25% increment. increasing the new food and decreasing the old food.  this will not cause diarrhea and safely switch into new food.

L56Hh2diaa	Auf jeden Fall drin halten,<br>  ich habe 2 Hunde die immer raus aus dem Haus und rein aus dem GArten dürfen.<br>  <br>  Die Katzen die ich zu letzt zu uns geholt habe, habe ich in einem Zimmer gehalten. Da sie Babykatzen waren ,habe ich eine selbst gebastelte Netztür angebracht. Die konnten sowohl uns, als auch die Hunde immer sehen. Oft habe ich die Hunde zu ihnen unter Aufsicht rein gelassen. <br>  Man sagt 4 Wochen im Haus reichen. Ich habe Katzen immer zwischen 5  und 8 Monate drin gelassen. Da wir nach paar Jahren immer umgezogen sind, wollten wir , dass die Katzen uns für Revier halten und nicht die Umgebung draussen. Dann hatten wir aber nie Problemen nach Umzügen. Bei jedem Umzug konnten wir die Katzen (es waren 2-3) immer schon am zweiten TAg raus lassen. <br>  Katzen sind vorsichtig und Revier bewusst so kam es, dass sie uns mit unseren HUnden und M?bel als Revier betrachteten und ganz langsam erst die Gegend erkundigt haben. <br>  WAs ich aber Euch empfehlen würde Katzentür sp?ter anbringen und sie für die Nacht immer im Haus halten. <br>  Die lernen schnell ihren Namen und wenn man sie oft  ruft, gew?hnen sie an das Nach hause kommen.<br>  <br>  Also, 6 Wochen im Haus halten auf jeden Fall. <br>  Vielleicht ein Zimmer ihr preparieren.<br>  und sp?ter für die Nacht sie immer ins Haus holen.<br>  <br>  Sonst ist es eine reine Glücksache, ob alles für sie gut geht. <br>  Ich wei?, auf dem Land h?lt man Katzen anderes, dem entsprechen sterben und verschwinden auch viele.<br>  <br>  Liebe Grü?e aniko<br>  <br>  <br>  ERg?nzung: wenn Jungkatze kommt das Sch?ne Wohnen kann man für eine Weile vergessen. Alles was wertvoll ist , erstmal wegr?umen.<br>  <br>  Man sollte das K?tzchen wegen "wertvoller Gegenst?nde" nciht aus dem Haus sprerren. WEnn man die Mühe nicht nimmt, dem K?tzchen ihr Umfeld zu gestalten,dann lieber keines anschaffen.<br>  übrigens mit 6 Monaten machen sie nichts mehr kaputt und man kann sie auch erziehen.<br>   Dann kann man wieder alles auspacken und für die n?chste 15 Jahre wird durch die Katze<br>  im vergleich zu Menschen kaum was kaputt gehen.|`|6f04faf3de22a643d6aeec0b6ebdacf3aa	Wenn das Tier schon Hauserfahrung hat reichen ca,. 2 Wochen für das Eingew?hnen.

Und wenn nicht....!??|`|nrCbGGOuaa	Wir bekamen letzten Sommer zwei halbwüchsige Katzen vom Tierheim, die hatten zuvor wild gelebt, waren total dürr und misstrauisch. <br>  Zun?chst durften die nur im Wohnzimmer sein - da stellten wir natürlich auch das Katzenklo hin. Die Katzen versteckten sich in den dunkelsten Ecken, klemmten sich hinter Schr?nke etc. und benahmen sich so panisch, dass wir schon dachten, o je, so durchgeknallt wie die sind, die werden nicht mehr normal. Ihr Futter fra?en sie immer erst, wenn niemand im Zimmer war.<br>  Da wir ihnen aber das Futter immer zur selben zeit hinstellten, fingen sie dann allm?hlich an, zur Fütterungszeit herauszukommen und sich sehen zu lassen. Dann hockten sie sichaufs Fensterbrett und blickten sehnsüchtig nach drau?en. <br>  Schlie?lich wurden sie lockerer, das dauerte aber ca. 3 Wochen.<br>  Dann durften sie immer einen weiteren Raum erobern und kennen lernen. Zun?chst den Hausflur und den Keller (aber da unser Keller sehr weitl?ufig und verwinkelt ist, dort nur einen Raum. Das Katzenklo begann jetzt zu "wandern", erst mal zur Tür zwischen Wohnzimmer und Flur, dann vor die Kellertür, dann unten an die Kellertreppe. Wir machten das deshlab schrittweise, weil wir Angst hatten, dass wenn sie ihr Klo nicht gleiuch sehen, nachdem wir es verschoben haben, sie ihr Gesch?ft wom?glich auf die Couch oder ein ebenfalls saugf?higes Stuhlkissen entsorgen ...<br>  Gleichzeitig hatten wir eine Katzenklappe in die Tür zum Keller eingebaut, da hatten sie zun?chst gro?e Schwierigkeiten damit, daher mussten wir sie hochstellen.<br>  Danach durften sie immer einen Kelleraum weiter und auch in den ersten Stock. Jetzt waren sie schon so zutraulich, dass sie nicht mehr wegrannten, sondern sich vor einen hinstellten und miauend ihr Futter einforderten. Auch durften sie jetzt raus auf die Terrasse, wo sie mit gro?en Augen das Treiben der V?gel im Garten beobachteten. Da fanden wir es an der Zeit, die zweite Katzenklappe (Kellerfenster nach drau?en zum Hof und Garten) zu installieren. Diemal ging es schneller. Und alles ging gut.<br>  Inzwischen sind sie total zutraulich und verschmust, sie laufen einem vor Liebe vor die Fü?e und nehmen es nicht mal übel, wenn man versehentlich über sie stolpert und dabei weg kickt.<br>  Sie bringen in ihrer Dankbarkeit regelm??ig tote oder auch noch lebende Tiere ins Wohnzimmer und schreien dabei laut, damit man darauf aufmerksam wird und sie lobt: Spitzm?use (die fressen sie nicht, sondern spielen blo? damit), echte M?use und Singv?gel (die werden fast restlos weggeputzt, wenn sie nicht mehr mitspeilen wollen), auch mal eine junge Ratte, eine Amsel, eine halbwüchsige Elster.|`|4neyFF8Uaa	Nun ja - ein wenig h?ngt das auch von der Bindung zu IHREM Menschen ab...die sollte schon "gefestigt" sein. Weil das aber so unterschiedlich ist, sind auch die Zeitangeben eben sehr unterscheidelich...ist schon ein Unterschied, ob die Mieze "neu" ist - oder aber mit mir (nach Jahren des Zusammenlebens)  umzieht!<br>  <br>  Dennoch - auch Miezen brauchen eine gewisse Zeit, um sich die Umgebungsger?uche und - Gerüche einzupr?gen..Auch um en "Stand der Sonne" am neuen Wohnort zu verinnerlichen.Das sind ja die Gründe! Aber eben sehr wichtige. Schlie?lich sollen sie ja heimfinden, die Sü?en. Auch dann, wenn Mieze sich mal erschreckt.<br>  <br>  Zu jungen Katzen - da sollte man bis nach der Kastration warten! Zum einen, weil dann das Revier merklich kleiner ausf?llt, zum anderen, weil es genügend Katzen gibt. Heutzutage k?nnen 4 Monate alte Katzenm?dchen schon mal "empfangen" und 5 Monate alte Katerchen "zeugen",,,,  Katzen werden imme früher "reif"!<br>  Dei hormonelle Umstellung dauert weitere ca. 12 Wochen. Was eben für die Ausweitung des Revieres von bedeutung ist. Unkastrierte kater laufen km-weit Halter würden echt staunen - WIE weit....und behalten das auch bei, wenn sie vor der Kastration hinaus gelassen werden. Ist so - und auch untersucht worden.<br>  <br>  Das alles muss bedacht werden. Immer ist es "sicherer" Mieze so lange wie m?glich IM Haus zu behalten. Und dann Schritt für Schritt vorzugehen.

DEdtNBBSaa	There is a great review site where you can compare different cat health care programs.  Since you have kittens, this is the perfect time to get them covered - before they get illnesses.  Some programs cover basic cat shots too.  Check out the Pets First plan.  Wishing you may purrs! Kate|`|LURQBU86aa	At my clinic in IL the costs are as follows.<br>  Kitten Exam-$35<br>  Rcp-$18.50<br>  Rabies-$20<br>  Rabies Tag-$10<br>  Fecal Exam-$22<br>  De-Worming-$12.50<br>  But depending on the age of your kitten it may not be old enough for the rabies vaccine. Usually they get it at around 4 months. If it is a young kitten like 8 weeks, it should get 3 booster shots of the Rcp vaccine and may need multiple dewormings.|`|EeTJ1CEHaa	You need to call a different vet. Some list prices on line.|`|4TX26viFaa	The exam fee would be included $35 here). Rabies shot is usually $15, Distemper is usually $18 for the full injection, but kittens usually get it broken into two doses for their body to handle.  <br>  <br>  The vets SHOULD be able to quote you over the phone, these are standard things.  If they don't then ask them why they can't do that for you, as you're trying to budget things.  Any good vet will be up front on standard care prices like this.|`|d6kekKgeaa	if you're in the US and have a humane society with a vet clinic in it they are very good and cheaper then regular vets. mine charges $45 for the check-up and just under $20 for each shot. if the vet you called wont give you a straight answer, they may be the type of place that wants to slip in extra charges for extra things. when my cat got sick 12 yrs ago i took him to All Pets vet clinic - i knew he was sick from getting into a whitches bain bush (contact poisen)  i got sick just reaching in to get him out. - they ran every test for everything that had nothing to do with what i told them was wrong, untill they had suck us dry of all our money. like the person above me said, if they wont give you a straight answer, call a diffrent vet. i've also heard that Petsmart has reasnobal rates, but i havn't checked them myself, cause i love the vet i currently have and have no interest in switching.

FQyeGsIyaa	Since it's just for the weekend, I'd leave your cat at home and let your neighbor check up on him.  It will be much less stressful for the cat than the ride and trying to get used to a new place for such a short period of time.<br>  <br>  At some point, you might want to get your cat used to taking trips in the car.  It's a gradual process but worth it.  It makes rides to the vet and anywhere else you may take him much easier.  I take my cat to our summer cottage for the month of August every year.  It's a 3hr drive and she sleeps the whole way.  She's gotten used to going there and settles in quickly now.  I still wouldn't take her there just for a weekend.|`|EeTJ1CEHaa	Depends on the cat. Most I've seen don't care for being in a car. However, there is always the exception. My Mikey loved to ride with me in my truck. He'd sit on the center console & look around and was thrilled to be there. If you've never tried it, give it a trial run around the block. As far as being out of town, the cat may not be comfortable in a new place, so for that reason he may be better off at home.|`|IddUYNR3aa	Cats are less stressed when they are in their own home.

You can have a neighbor check on him if you like, but you don't have to.  We have left our cats home like this on many occasions.  The worst problem we've had is finding a hairball now and then.<br>  <br>  Oh, if you have a cat flap or something like that, I would block that so he can't get outside.  But otherwise, I think you'll have no problems.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	you should leave the cat home otherwise it could be very stressful for him!  When I go on vacation, I usually go away for about a week.

JgC9a8m2aa	If she's in season and the mating was actually successful, then the vulva should start to shrink after a week and return to normal size in about 3-4 weeks. If it doesn't start to shrink after about a week, then she's not pregnant and she will remain in heat (or there's something else going on and she's not even in season). If it doesn't start to show signs of shrinkage, then I would have her looked at by a vet. It could be adrenal gland disease or, if the enlarged vulva is from her being in season, then the male isn't successfully impregnating her and she might end up needing a hormone injection to come out of heat. <br>  <br>  I really hope you know what you're doing when it comes to breeding ferrets - it's not as simple as putting a male and female together, let them work their "magic," and then boom, you have some cute little kits. Certain color combos can produce lethal genes, there's several conditions that the mother ferret could develop which will require immediate vet care, some mother ferrets have problems with delivery, some mothers reject their kits, and some are unable to nurse - these are all things that you could be faced with and you need to know how to handle the situations if you are faced with them. I'm sure you don't want a lecture, but there's so much to know when it comes to breeding ferrets and it would be a good idea to reconsider breeding them if you don't know enough about it.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	You should definitely take her to a vet because that's not normal and you can't treat her yourself, and she probably will die if she doesn't get some help. And there is no good reason to breed ferrets. Ferrets are so overpopulated and there are thousands that need homes. Get your female spayed.|`|rQlzfHqraa	The enlarged vulva may be her hormones preparing her to except the male and the fur should be a lining of the nest.|`|FR5lFHmPaa	Are they both in season? if not, I would take her to the vet.

So please take them to the vet to verify they have been spayed and also to get their checkup and shots.|`|AA11359147	how old is she? sounds possibly like adrenal gland disease. usually an enlarged vulva is a sign of adrenal disease. is she losing hair at the base of her tail? definitely take her to the vet.|`|3Y6oROG4aa	im not sure really...i never had an un neutered ferret so i really wouldn't know the signs of a pregnant ferret because where i live you can't buy an un neutered ferret...

OdDbR4Psaa	It's hard to say and usually depends on the fish and the food. Not all will eat themselves to death, some will actually eat until they are full or satisfied. <br>  <br>  For example, this one time, my cousin fed my fish a whole bunch of live mosquito larvae, which stays at the surface of the water. I didn't know about this until about a while after when I came in to check on my fish and found a bunch of uneaten mosquito larvae. And my fish had no interest in it whatsoever because..well, he was full. <br>  <br>  Highly concentrated dried food may cause problems with some fish, but live or fresh foods are hard to overfeed. Also, usually overfeeding is not the cause of death, but rather the decreased water quality (rise of ammonia/nitrites..etc.) caused by decaying food, extra waste...etc.|`|rLXNhktnaa	this is true of some fish... but not all<br>  goldfish in particular are known for eating themselves to death, but alot of fish will merely let the abundnace alone|`|uNfWYSfJaa	YES most likely the goldfish would die fastest because there memory only last 3 seconds but all fish will eat till they explode or just burst but only if your supplying the food.|`|0TTZERJmaa	yes because they have a 5 min memory|`|mOayTJDmaa	Yes
DD1oxtxyaa	I was in the pet store today and there they sold a spray bottle called Bitter. It seems to stop cats from gnawing and clawing furniture. I don't know if it works because I have never used it, but something like that might be worth checking out. |`|f8097de47ae58031953feaf9b3ebd6cdaa	 Get a scratching post, also, my cats wouldn't scratch their post, so I pretended to be scratching their scratching post and they copied after awhile. Also, maybe you could get one of those new pedicure tools to clip the claws.  Since most people either end up hurting the cat or the cat becomes fearful of any attempt to even pick up a tool, let alone snipping its paws.  If your kitty is old, then you may consider that.  Him reacting with clawing could be an indication that he is in need of a snipping.  |`|c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	Put come clear plastic box tape where your cat is scratching.

Every morning at 7a.m., Chief would come to the back door and peck at it until I let him in and then he'd run to the master bath, jump up on the counter and waited until I was dressed.  When I was ready, he'd jump down, follow me to the door and we'd walk together to the barn to feed the animals.

VhWll8Vjaa	Kittens are VERY playful. And everything you explain is totally normal and to be expected. Plus, she was even younger when you got her... so that would make her even more playful.<br>  Just imagine, she was once with her siblings who she could play with 24/7... life was a total game. Now she has just 2 humans to entertain her, who wont always feel like playing. She will get bored and frustrated, and she wont care if it's 4am in the morning!!!<br>  <br>  I would suggest having her sleep in another room than you at night until she gets a bit older. My cats are 3 years old and if I allow them in my room at night, they go mental and think it's a playground. If I move under my duvet they pounce on me and go wild. It's normal kitten/cat behaviour, and you cannot stop it. All you can do is shut them out of the room when you want some peace.<br>  <br>  This is to be expected. They will grow out of it, but let me warn you... you're kitten is only 8 weeks old so you have many more months of this to come.<br>  <br>  Also because she was taken away from mum and siblings a bit too early, she wont have learnt quite as much as she could have done from mum if she had an extra 2 - 4 weeks with her. The first few weeks of a kittens life are very important, and mum teaches them alot.|`|qJquEEdmaa	don't beat your cat or anything but you need to set guidelines for it.<br>  you need to punish it so it knows when it is doing something wrong.  if that fails well then maybe you should slowly ween the cat off of you.  give it a little alone time.  also it is still a kitten so that playfulness will not stay forever give it some time|`|jz7dbg2saa	Lol...play with her during the day, but at night just "scratch" her neck alittle and go back to sleep..don't give her attention at night, then by daytime play with her as long as you can...this worked for me|`|VlxBs9zyaa	play with her.|`|666c6020e66411db3b5791b72f6e4679aa	give her a ball of string!!!:)|`|W5GYvyyxaa	Shes making up from loosing her litter mates and MUM so earlie.she should not of been away from mum at 6wks, (another irresponsible owner??)Shes treating you as her litter mates and wants to play,shes only a baby.you must try to ignore her in bed ,but remember shes exploring everything.and 2wks is no time to explore a full house!!!<br>  good luck and enjoy her while shes young|`|wrhG6b1laa	well as you know cats are hunters by nature so they love to be up at night. I should know my 15 year old cat (Patch) still does it. the only thing I have figure out is give you cat a ton of attention an hour or two before be. that way it will get all of your kittens nervous energy off and you can sleep at night. you may have to do it 3-4 hour before bed if she is still attacking you after 2 hours of play. I hope this helps. good luck and best wishes on sleep.|`|xKuWE9gfaa	I know exactly what you mean. I was hoping that Tiger (my Tortoiseshell kitten) would sleep on my bed but 'oh boy' was I wrong. I read when I first go to bed and she plays with my toes through the duvet everytime I move. She also loves to jump from the bed and hang on the curtains.I decided that the best thing to do was let her play for a while (and try to prevent her climbing the curtains)I then pick her up and put her into the hall where she has her bed, water, and some toys and I don't hear from her until I get up. <br>  I also tried just putting the lights out hoping that she would get the hint but no way. She managed to crawl under the duvet and down my legs which was ok until she was tickling my feet. She would also gentle tap my nose as if to say 'Come on PLAYTIME' <br>  I think you will have to just put up with it or like myself, play with her and then put her out of your room.|`|ByxEE8eeaa	I'm sure she'll grow out of it. Kittens tend to have a lot of energy. I think you should leave her in her own space at night.

She sounds pretty cute.|`|msOABQbSaa	My kitten did this when she was younger, we gave her a small teddy bear and she stayed with it on the end of the bed, just playing with it, whenever i moved the bear moved and she would be straight onto it.

She and her brother were found in the woods by my wife's co-worker; the mom was nowhere in sight.  She had a fascination with my wife's hair -- wanted to chew on it and claw at it.  After several weeks of trying to deal with it, we just had to close our bedroom door.  Although it upset her a little bit at first (crying and clawing at the door), she finally accepted it.  Just make sure she has plenty of toys.  Our is a year old now and is content to just lay on our chests and look in our faces while we sleep!|`|DtkLsetkaa	She is just being playful!!  If she is bothering you when you sleep, there are two things you can do (actually 3).  Try your best to wear her out before bed, so she will sleep through the night, but a kitten has so much energy that its likely she will wake back up during the night and want playtime.  You can close your bedroom door to keep her out.  She will be fine in the house by herself as long as its kitten proofed already.  The other option is to get her a friend!!  Kittens LOVE having a playmate, and a second kitten would be a wonderful companion.  While the cost is more, the work is about the same.  Just a few things to consider :)  Enjoy her kitten phase, it goes so fast!!  Take lots of pictures lol.<br>  <br>  Yay the thumbs down fairy paid us a visit today *sprinkles fairy dust for the thumbs down fairy*|`|UNFxjNHkaa	She's too young to be away from her mother!  That kitten should have stayed with her mom till she was at least 10 weeks old.... You said she's 8 weeks old and you've had her for 2 weeks?  That means she was 6 weeks old when you got her.... where did you get her from?!  Im completely shocked that she was taken from her mother so soon...<br>  <br>  anyway- she's a kitten, she's playing - that is what kittens do!  As she gets older she'll calm down - also dont forget to have her spayed when the time comes!  That also helps them to calm down<br>  <br>  <br>  What's with the thumbs down?|`|6jW5L3Vqaa	Hey ;)<br>  <br>  It's probably best to keep her downstairs at night, until she realises that night time = sleep. <br>  <br>  Then, you could move her back into your room and she'll probably just go to sleep.. although as soon as it becomes daylight, she'll be up and wantin' to play haha|`|uRKZkBfjaa	Shut her in a room that she can't escape from and make sure she has a litter tray. She will learn to entertain herself.|`|AA11451457	Dont have her in the bedroom, its easy! I mean, shes a cat so she doesnt need to sleep with you guys. My 2 have been kept in the kitchen overnight since we got them at 8wks old (theyre now 3yrs old) and theyre lovely, well adapted cats. Still very playful and it hasnt had a detrimental effect, keeping them out the bedroom overnight. Dont let you cat dictate your sleeping pattern! They get their own way with everything else lol|`|TiAK1629aa	Welcome to living with a kitten.  We haven't ever been able to leave our out of their bedrooms until they were around 8 mths old or so.  We are currently attempting to train two to sleeping in the bed.  Weirdest thing is, if it's daylight outside, they will come lay down and nap until we get up, but if it's dark....look out!!!  My suggestion is that you put her in a room at bedtime, give her plenty of food and water, and let her back out first thing in the morning.  Another possibility is to play with her until she's more tired, and she might be able to sleep through the night with you.  Get one of those laser light pointer toys for cats...they're only a couple of dollars and it's an easy way to run off all of that energy.

Mir ist das auch schon ein paar Mal passiert.

Some dogs will stand for being constantly poked, pulled, and prodded in the eye by a small child, but most will just get to a point where enough is enough. So whatever dog you choose, you must never, ever leave them alone with small children. A dog will naturally protect a child, but sometime s the instinct will be to bite if provoked enough. <br>  <br>  Having said all that, and taking all the precautions, Labradors do see to love being with kids.  Good luck!|`|1aY6H3h1aa	Hi I have 3 kids and just bought a puppy. I did a lot of researching because we had an allergy issue. My youngest is 3 and we ended up with a yorkie. Neighboors of mine had a wonderful dog and we met the breeder etc. It's hard with small children. my 3 yr old needed to be able to understand when to read the dog's clues about being let be. I think you will have to watch your 1 yr. old but you probably realize that. Yorkies might be too small but a Tibetan Terrier has only ever been bred to be a companion dog. Is supposed to be excellent with kids. it is hypo allergenic and although has lots of hair doesn't shed as much as you'd think. That was going to be my #1 until I saw this yorkie in person. Ask around people you know. Puppy handling and breeder makes huge difference in temperment.|`|4183be8de7c1998c0749a8c7099d7c8caa	a lab they think that it is their job to protect the younger ones they are so sweet and will let the kids do what ever they want to do|`|779e0c425cb530922b6f51cba95845bfaa	I think labs make wonderful dogs!  They are espeically good with kids.  They have soooo much energy that the kids and the dog might just wear each other out playing(which in turn gives you a break!  LoL!)!  Labs can be very obedient and loyal and they are great pets!  Growing up, we had a Black Lab and a Beagle(which are also good dogs, but sometimes they can be loud but that goes with all dogs!).  It was me, my sister(who was 6 years younger), my mom, my stepdad and the dogs!  We would play with the dogs constantly which benefits the dogs and the kids, plus it kept us busy and never bored!  They are rather big dogs though, so that can pose a problem if you are looking for something to keep indoors.  Since you want a small dog, you might want to look at minatures.  Try pomeranian or shnouzer(sp?)!  I do not suggest Chiuauas(sp) because they are loud and very VERY nervous dogs.  Poodles and Miniature Pinscher, in my experience, can also be a pain!  Most small dogs are very nervous.  I don't know how well these kinds of dogs do with kids.  I guess it depends on how your children react to the dog.  Good luck!|`|7ulYx5Uaaa	the problem with small children is they don't understand pulling ears and poking eyes etc. hurts the animals. that's why children get bit. you as a parent are responsible for keeping a safe and secure environment for pet and children. there is no safe dog for a child of that age. i would re-consider getting a dog until your youngest child is 5 years old. then test the dog for aggression.<br>   visit your local shelter to choose a dog to rescue. they will test it for you.<br>                good luck|`|fb5d8d49d6ca7655d710daac33cf9f05aa	This page has great information about choosing a dog for a household with children:<br>  Children and Dogs: Important Information for Parents<br>  <a href="http://www.ddfl.org/behavior/kidsdogs.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ddfl.org/behavior/kidsdogs.pd...</a><br>  <br>  This link has wonderful information about dog & child safety:<br>  <a href="http://www.doggonesafe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.doggonesafe.com/</a>|`|7d60c2e4179cf0fe8df7c2b55c02fd32aa	oooo,,  go to AKC.ORG  click on the TOY GROUP  and read all about all the different breeds in this group,,, you will learn personality traits, grooming requirements,, temperament  etc..

Below is a little quiz that might help you with your search! Good luck!|`|5a624aa779b568ad8352717a1937b6aaaa	I would say a beagle,they are such sweet dogs,and they love kids,just be careful not to get one that would be too playful,because then they would be left out when you're busy with the kids.Hope this Helps!!|`|AA11896152	You may want to give up on the small dog, they are usually way too hyper.  A bulldog is actually not a bad idea.  Their temperament depends mostly on their training, not their heredity.  Not a pit bul necessarily, but a French or English bulldog.  Another breed that might work is a Bassett hound. Although they are pretty big, they are also fairly laidback.  If you really want to get a dog now, maybe you could go to the pound and pick a dog that's already grown.  A puppy might be too much with toddlers running around.

Have your dad give her some extra attention that is kind and gentle. Do not yell at or around her if at all possible. Try to make sure that all of your dogs are treated and disciplined the same. When giving toys, give one to all of them. Feed them all at the same time. Spoil them all the same. The key is lots of love, equality and fairness. NEVER let her tell you she is boss.

SYqA73p4aa	lee esto <br>  <br>   ?Cómo educar a su perro?<br>  <br>  Redacción de Buen Día<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Si su perro hace una "gracia" en un lugar indebido, o se sube a su cama sin su consentimiento, es hora de que piense en educarlo para establecer algunos límites de conducta.<br>  <br>  Primero hay que hacer la diferencia entre educar y adiestrar, pues ambas funciones son diferentes. La educación de la mascota debe empezar desde sus primeros a?os, es decir, desde que es un cachorro.<br>  <br>  Preferiblemente la educación debe estar en manos de su due?o, estableciendo<br>  normas y límites en casa, de manera que el perro aprenda qué debe o no debe<br>  hacer...<br>  <br>  Según el veterinario Oscar Robert, la educación del animal inicia desde el momento en que llega al hogar. Si usted está por comprar un perrito, tenga en cuenta que va a necesitar dos cosas indispensables: tiempo y paciencia. “Tiempo para corregirlo en el momento en que comete una falta, paciencia porque hay perros que necesitan más tiempo que otros para aprender una conducta, explicó Robert.<br>  <br>  Según Mary Carmen Marín, veterinaria y especialista en comportamiento canino, si usted quiere llevarse un perrito para su casa, no lo elija por el color o tama?o, sino por el tipo de carácter del perro. “Es más fácil evitar que corregir”, detalló Marín.<br>  <br>  La idea es que el due?o del animal lo eduque de una forma positiva y amena.<br>  <br>  Luego de obtener una respuesta, conviene que el perro reciba una recompensa o premio, preferiblemente una palabra amable o una caricia, no necesariamente tiene que ser un alimento.<br>  <br>  Conviene que en casa todos se pongan de acuerdo para educarlo, ser constantes y establecer los limites por igual.<br>  <br>  Situaciones para corregir<br>  <br>  *Al abrir una puerta, no deje que el perro pase primero, ya que eso le indicará que él es quien manda en la casa y no debe ser así.<br>  <br>  Según la especialista Marín, el perro necesita saber en qué lugar de la jerarquía se encuentra. Los perros ven a los humanos como parte de la manada, si él siente que no hay jefe, entonces el animal asume el rol.<br>  <br>  Cómo demostrarlo<br>  <br>  Los especialistas afirman que basta dirigirse al animal con tono de mando y firme, “ni siquiera hay necesidad de castigarlo”, se?alaron. Tampoco hay que darle todas las cosas en el momento en que las pide, por ejemplo, usted le puede ense?ar al perro que debe sentarse antes de darle la comida.<br>  <br>  Perros que se orinan después de un a?o<br>  <br>  Hay dos causas. Si es macho es porque ellos necesitan marcar el territorio. La otra es porque no los han ense?ado. Se recomienda poner una marca olfatoria: que es tomar un periódico, ponerlo en donde el perro se haya orinado, esperar que el papel absorba la orina y poner el periódico en donde se quiere que orine.<br>  <br>  También hay perros que se orinan de emoción cuando ven a sus due?os, esto es porque son sumisos y tienen poca confianza en sí mismos. Si usted se agacha y les habla a su nivel, es posible que la situación mejore.<br>  <br>  <br>  Perros que se suben a la gente<br>  <br>  Para evitarlo, los especialistas recomiendan ponerles la rodilla, esto lo verán como un estímulo negativo. “Otra es agarrarle “las manos” y majarle un poquito la pata, solo para que sienta una peque?a molestia”, explicó Mary Carmen. Otra forma es ignorando al perro.<br>  <br>  <br>  Perros que destruyen muebles<br>  <br>  “Lo hacen por aburrimiento”, detalló Robert. No hay que limitar al perro al patio y sin juguetes. Hay que jugar con él y explicarle con ejemplos, cómo puede gastar energía.<br>  <br>  <br>  Perros que se comen lo que defecan<br>  <br>  Puede ser de origen parasitorio, por deficiencias de vitaminas o mala absorción digestiva. Lo mejor es llevar al perro a que le hagan un chequeo completo para eliminar cualquier causa orgánica.<br>  <br>  También existen unas pastillas que le dan mal sabor a las heces y cuando el perro las intenta comer, definitivamente no puede.<br>  <br>  <br>  ?Por qué un perro puede atacar y morder a alguien?<br>  <br>  Según Mary Carmen, hay un periodo llamado de socialización, que es de la semana 6 a la 12, durante el cual se aconseja relacionar al perro con la gente: ni?os, ancianos y también con otros animales. “A veces los perros ven a un ni?o y le ladran porque sencillamente no los conocen y le temen a lo desconocido”, detalló la especialista.<br>  <br>  <br>  Después de la educación viene el adiestramiento, que es algo más especializado, y si se quiere opcional.<br>  <br>  El adiestramiento contempla, entre otras, algunas destrezas de obediencia como echarse o levantarse cada vez que se le indica.<br>  <br>  Recuerde que usted necesitará de una buena dosis de paciencia para educar a su mascota y sobre todo para adiestrarla.|`|0ZLY64Ojaa	Dentro de el cuidado de los perros existe una caracteristica de algunos de ellos que se llama Vejiga neurogena, y es exactamente el que se orinen cuando reciben atencion y se emocionan, esto se termina con la edad, cuando adquieren con la edad y experiencia cierta maduez psicologica y cerebral (neurologicamente hablando). Cuando se orinan en un punto en especifico lo que debes hacer es rega?arla, con ruido y escandalo mas que con algo fisico, de manera inmediata, colocandola sobre la "mala accion" y haciendo el rega?o; si lo haces despues de 10 minutos, los perros no estan seguros sobre que es lo que hicieron mal. Te recomiendo que compres en el super o en una veterinaria un repelente y un atrayente para perros, esta hecho a base de amoniaco, entonces lavas super bien el area donde no quieres que orine y despues le aplicas el repelente con un atomizador, y donde quieres que orine ( en el patio, cerca de la rejilla de la alcantarilla, la cama de tu hermano, etc.) le aplicas el atrayente y hecho. Funciona muy bien, y en este sentido es mucho mas facil que te resulte con una hembra que un macho, ya que como ocurre en muchas especies y muchos sentidos, los machos son mucho mas tercos.|`|0vMdrfMSaa	Lo que puedes hacer es rociar vinagre en el lugar donde se orina, para que pierda su propio olor y así buscar otro lugar donde hacer sus necesidades, aprovecha que esta aún cachorrito para que la puedas educar, y hablale, veraz como te entiende.<br>  Saludos|`|6Yojlg4xaa	Yo le ense?e a mi perro rega?andolo diciendole que "no ahi" con voz fuerte, le pegaba con un periodico peque?o (no duele)  e inmediatamente despues lo llevaba al lugar correcto y lo acariciaba, lo consentia, para que supiera la diferencia.|`|7bPzNIoDaa	Lo que pasa es que se ha acostumbrado a hacerlo en ese sitio y para ella al ser un cachorro su instinto le dice que tiene que hacer el pis en ese sitio porque a lo mejor antes la habeis dejado que lo hiciera y porque huele a su orina. Lo importante es que limpieis bien toda la casa incluido ese rincón especialmente con algún producto y que useis unos productos que venden que repelen al perro para que no lo haga. Además es importantisimo que la saques a sus horas para que se vaya a acostumbrando, tienes que tener en cuenta que es siempre despues de cada comida que ahora mismo deberian de ser 3 y cuando se despierte de una larga siesta . <br>  Además si tienes patio o jardín, o en todo caso una terraza lo normal es que la intentes dejar siempre que no estés delante y la puedas controlar  fuera para que no te haga ninguna trastada, además deberias de intentar estar atenta para pillar por sorpresa en el momento que lo hace y llevarla corriendo al sitio donde quieres que lo haga y rega?arla cada vez que lo haga ahí.|`|GPGIMCB0aa	la mejor,mas rapida, cruel, pero efectiva solucion: mira yo tube el mismo problema y lo solucione de la siguiente manera : cuando la perrita haga de sus necesidades en la sala agarrala y acercale el hocico a la popo y embarraselo dandole unas nalgaditas y rega?andola con una o 2 veces sera suficiente jamas lo volvera a hacer te lo garantizo se que suena cruel y asqueroso pero es una efectiva solucion ahi que ba?arla despues suerte y que te sirva y cuidala mucho ok.|`|ITs0hAuBaa	mira en las tiendas venden una especie de pa?ales o trapos para cachorros, se ve que el perro orina en ese sitio y luego poco a poco vas trasladando esos trapos hasta el sitio donde quieres que el perro orine, Si tu amiga lo hace en un punto de la casa, pon un jarron o algo en ese sitio. Por ejempolo una silla, aunque sea en medio del pasillo. Si tu perra se orina cuando alguien la acaricia, no es que este malcriada, es por sumision,  te esta diciendo que ella es una cachorrita que aun no tiene control sobre sus esfinteres. Cuando haga eso no la ri?as, pues sera peor, levantante e ignorala. Sinceramente yo la llevaria aun educador canino para que te diga que pautas seguir y que debes hacer. A veces la culpa no es de los perros sino de los amos, no lo olvides si orina en ese punto de la casa sera por algo, intenta recordar cual fue el primer dia que orino alli, que le dijisteis, es muy importante.<br>  Si lo hacen donde no debes nunca jamas debes restregarle el hocico en sus heces, porque para ellos las heces no es nada malo, para ti si, pero para ellos no, aparte de que no entendera nada de lo que quieres decir. Segun tu logica hujmana es " le restriego para que aprenda que ahi no debe ca.gar" sinceramente tu lo entiendes? que tiene que ver restregar el hocico en las heces con que ahi no debe hacerse, nada en absoluto. Si lo pillas haciendo donde no debe, pega un grito por ejemplo He o No y si llegas a tiempo cogelo y llevalo al sitio donde quieres que lo haga, y alli lo acaricias mucho para que ella sepa que lo ha hecho bien y tu estas contenta. Y ni se te ocurra pegarle con un cinturon como te propone uno loco, pues eso es maltrato animal y el perro mas que aprender te tendra mucho miedo. Para educar siempre hay que usar la paciencia, los mimos, las caricias y los premios.|`|bsFVN7PKaa	XD:<br>  <br>  los perros son iguales alos ni?os chiquitos cuando se haga restiegale la trompa donde se hiso rega?ala pegale y dile hay no!! vas donde quieres que haga y dices aqui si!! aya no!!! y todas la veces cuando lo haga|`|M21NvkTfaa	lee esto que estoy segura que te ayudara<br>  <br>  Para tu perro, hacer sus necesidades en un lugar u otro es una cuestión de costumbre. Hacerlas dentro o fuera de la casa, en un sitio en concreto, es lo mismo para él: una costumbre. Las costumbres necesitan tiempo para establecerse, cuantas más veces se pueda repetir la misma acción, mejor establecida estará la costumbre. Una vez establecida necesitará tanto tiempo para desaparecer como el que necesitó para establecerse. <br>  No solamente estarás acostumbrándolo a hacer las necesidades en la calle. También estarás haciendo desaparecer la actual costumbre de hacerlo todo en el lugar equivocado. Esto se llama deshabituar. Para que tenga éxito es muy importante conseguir que tu perro no pueda cometer ni una sola vez el error de siempre. Cada vez que pueda volver a hacerlo mal pierdes algo de lo conseguido. Cuantas más veces se pueda equivocar, más difícil resultará cambiar la costumbre. Incluso puede llegar un momento en que ya no consigas nunca lo que quieres. Así que debes estar muy pendiente de todo lo que pase, no puedes dedicar tiempo a otra cosa. <br>  La ense?anza más eficaz será la que permita a tu perro hacer sus necesidades siempre en la calle. No es fácil, porque suele tener la necesidad de hacer pis o caca muchas veces al día. Si sabes detectar cuándo tendrá ganas y sacarlo antes de que se lo haga, conseguirás que no se "equivoque" nunca (?realmente no se está equivocando porque no sabe dónde sí y dónde no debe hacerlo!) Haciéndolo siempre en el lugar que tú elijas como el más adecuado, adaptará la costumbre de hacerlo ahí como la cosa más natural del mundo. <br>  Para saber cuándo tu perro tendrá necesidad te puede ayudar saber que hay muchos momentos en los que tiene que hacer algo seguro: <br>  Hasta que él no tenga bien claro que debe hacer sus necesidades fuera de casa, no debes corregirlo cuando se equivoque dentro de casa. Lo que sí puedes hacer para intervenir cuando esté a punto de, o mientras que lo esté haciendo donde no debe, es levantarlo con tus manos alrededor de su pecho diciéndole "NO" y llevarlo afuera.<br>  Si estás muy pendiente de todos los momentos en que tu perro realice una de estas tres actividades, puedes estar en la calle con él casi siempre que lo necesite. Aparte de estos momentos, tendrá necesidad en otros también, más o menos cada dos horas suele hacer algo, lo cual quiere decir que al principio tienes que sacarlo cada dos horas. Haciendo este esfuerzo durante unas dos semanas él habrá desarrollado un principio de sentido de la limpieza. Claro que podrá cometer "errores" y tardará un tiempo en empezar a avisarte de que quiere salir. Avisará poniéndose de forma inquieta delante de la puerta, mirándote y/o haciendo ruiditos. Es muy importante que sepas evitar que tu perro tenga la oportunidad/necesidad de hacerlo donde no debe. Tienes que estar vigilando y controlándolo todo el tiempo. Una ayuda más: pon un horario muy estricto a todo lo relacionado con su digestión: dormir, comer, beber, jugar... Desde el principio debes aplicar un horario a sus tomas de agua y comida. Saca a tu perro siempre atado e intenta ignorarlo hasta que observes que hace algo. En este momento te pones contento, felicitándolo con voz agradable. Pronto entenderá que a su jefe le gusta mucho que haga sus necesidades. Si en el mismo instante en que empieza a hacer pis o caca le dices una o dos veces con tono algo serio la palabra pipí o caca y mientras lo está haciendo lo felicitas, conseguirás que aprenda a hacer pipí o caca a tu orden. No hace falta que te pongas excesivamente contento a la hora de felicitarlo. Hablarle de forma agradable es suficiente para que entienda que te gusta lo que hace. Evita volver a casa tan pronto como haya terminado su "tarea". Antes de volver pasea un poco más, o juega un poco con él. Así evitarás que aprenda que pipí significa: final del paseo.|`|WFAKAf5Haa	hola, yo tengo 3 perros chihuahua y creeme no me costo mucho ense?arlos, solo tienes que cacharlos en el acto(ni antes ni después) los rega?as fuerte(sin pegarles ni revolcarles el ocico en la pipí o popo es contra producente) los llevas afuera y los dejas al menos 2 horas y en 1 semana se ensena a ir afuera ya veras.|`|bnQT3XITaa	hola mira, lo que busca tu perrita es llamar la atenciòn y lo hace porque sabe que te molesta, tal vez, si le dedicas mas tiempo en estar con ella la apapachas y el sillon lo lavas muy bien para perder el olor a su orin.<br>  ojala te de resultado.|`|ouWy2J5Oaa	Es peque?a aún, tienes tiempo de ense?arte a ense?arle, a que haga pichí en donde debe.|`|SH8TA7KAaa	Mira lo ase por la falta que le ases te doy un consejo para evitar que se orine en la sala riega un poco de creolina  o en casos mas estremos se utiliza acpm (diesel) y veras que valdra la pena|`|6qWJHItCaa	no la dejes ese?ala  y rega?ala|`|91Lfaklaaa	habra que seguir insistiendo para que aprenda no.|`|RmXJXlQaaa	que otra persona la entrene|`|godEHRgUaa	Si tiene una perrita malcriada.

Just state the care he should be kept in and everything they should eat ect ect... and if the buyer emails you, tell him/her that you will only sell your birds if they promise to keep them in good care. Also people who go on Bird Channel are people who are interested about owning a bird properly and want to learn as much as they can(since this is a website that provides info, recipes, species profiles, and names of breeders and rescues ect ect... Someone asked about a website that they could sell there Shitzus on and I reccomended Dog Channel.com(theres a Bird Channel,Dog Channel,Cat Channel, and Horse Channel.com and they are all similar except for the speices difference). They ended up using that website so I think this will really work out for you.P.S you could sell the conure for 100$ and Lovebirds for 10$ if you want to give them away but just cant.

Hamsters are nocturnal so will sleep all day & be awake at night. Guinea pigs only sleep about 6hrs in a 24hr period. They need a medium cage. Rabbits need an even bigger cage. Pigs & rabbits need some exercise outside the cage everyday. Both need to chew to wear tehri ever growing teeth down. Rabbits tend to be more tempermental, guinea pigs rarely ever bite.  Pig are my recommendation. They need porper bedding material, either carefresh type paper stuff, or finely ground pine bedding (stay away from cedar) COuntry type stores sells huge bags of pine bedding for about $5, way less than a commercial store. They need paper towel rolls to chew on a regular basis, good quality food made for guinea pigs as they need extra vitaimin C. Oranges, cucumber peelings, carrots are all very well appreciated as well as some time outside in teh warm months. Pigs are very smart & will WHEEP when they want to eat, some wheep at teh sound of the fridge door opening when they want carrots etc. They are sturdy & over all healthier animals than rabbits. Ours lived to 7yrs.|`|sBn7D0h4aa	well when i had my guinea pigs i kept them in a cage like this <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/cubes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/cubes.htm</a> and it was much much cheaper than going to a petstore and buying a cage for them. and you could also probably build one for a rabbit as well which would also be much cheaper. <br>  <br>  Actual rabbit cages from a pet store are much more expensive ranging anywhere from about $90 on up.<br>  <br>  and hamster cages can be inexpensive if you get a very simple one with a platform and wheel only (around $15 at petsmart). If you want one with tubes or multiple levels they range form about $15 on up.<br>  <br>  it really just depends on what you really want but i'd say a hamster or guinea pig is probably going to be the cheapest route as far as cages go.<br>  <br>  And for supplies all three animals would need a water bottle, bedding and chew toys so they can keep there teeth grinded down so they don't get to long. <br>  <br>  With my experience with guinea pigs and hamsters, they both make alot of noise during the night. Hamsters are nocturnal so they may run in their wheel alot at night and guinea pigs make a chatter noise.<br>  <br>  I also reccomend purina's yesterdays news for bedding since it lasted longer, the odor control was great and it was less expensive overall. and another side note about guinea pigs (if your deciding to get multiple pigs) never have two males with a female. They get very dominant over the female and they will try and attack each other. (my mom got bit once holding both males even when they were both away from the female).|`|ak9DrBSwaa	You want to think of what you want in a pet, your resources - time, money, space, interest - and start there to narrow down the best pet for you. All are great pets, that have different personalities and care requirements and life spans. Do lots of research, so you pick the best match for your family.|`|tGmwqtr5aa	GUINEA PIG!!!!!! They are so loving and cute and they only cost about 30 dollars, but you should probably get one from a shelter, because there are so many that need loving homes. :D Hope I helped.<br>  <br>  Ethie|`|7BoXLwIkaa	food water cage ummmm the molchy stuff for the bottom|`|TwBgfWFraa	Depends on what you like best. I used to work at a pet store, and I found taht the hamsters tended to be less friendly than the guinea pigs and rabbits. They would bite at times when someone put their hands in the cages. I did however have a teddy bear hamster once and she was very sweet, but one day she bit my mothers finger very badly out of nowhere, so since then I have been very cautious of hamsters. <br>  Guinea pigs and rabbits are almost the same, and they can live togther in the same cage as well. Guinea pigs do make some really cute noises at times where as rabbits do not make any noise really.<br>  <br>  As far as what you would need... hamsters you would need a small cage, a hamster wheel they can run around in to get exorcise, bedding, water bottle. You can put toilet paper tubes (just the cardboard) in the cage and they will crawl through it and chew on it. You will need food and treats for them, as well as something for them to chew on that will help grind their teeth down so they do not get too long. If they do not grind them down some and they continue to grow, this can cause some serious problems and may cause them to not be able to eat (this is the same for guinea pigs and rabbits). Many people like to get the cages that have tubes and stuff built into them so the hamster has a "maze" to crawl around in and explore.<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs and rabbits have the same setup. You need a basic cage (does not need to have levels or attached tubes), a little "house" type thing that they can hide in or sleep in, food, water bottle, bedding, treats, and something to chew on to keep their teeth the proper length just like a hamster. The cage will be much larger than a hamster cage, so you would need to have the room for it. Both animals enjoy fresh fruits and veggies to eat (lettuce, carrots, apples, oranges, raisins, cheerios) and tend to be a little easier to find and catch if they get away from you in the house. hamsters are very small and fast so can get away from you easier. <br>  <br>  With any of these animals they need to be handled a lot from the time you get them so that they will develop a bond with you and not be scared of you. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!!!!   :)|`|9BbK9jM2aa	Depends on what you want your rabbit,hamster or gp to do.

UKpNiRf6aa	I understand you wanting to troubleshoot before your take your cat to the vet, but whenever there is a sudden change in behavior, consider that it might be a medical problem.  Take your cat to the veterinarian for a good examination.  Be sure to tell your veterinarian about the house-soiling problem.  If your cat gets a clean bill of health, here are a few things you can consider:<br>  <br>  Litter cleanliness: Be sure you keep the litter box very clean.  Cats are clean animals and some may want their box meticulous.  This may mean scooping 1-2 times daily and/or changing the entire material every 3-4 days.<br>  <br>  Litter box location:  Check around where the litter box is to be sure that there is not something about the location that the cat may find a problem.  This could be a noisy appliance, people walking by, the dog approaching, nearby children playing, or other cats in the household.<br>  <br>  Disharmony between housemates:  In a home with multiple cats, there may be subtle underlying tensions that may make one or more cats anxious.  This could lead to non-litter box usage.<br>  <br>  Continued use of one particular material:  If your cat has been eliminating outside of the litter box for some time, it may have developed a preference for another material besides litter.  <br>  <br>  If you think this is the case, consult your veterinarian for help or a referral to a veterinary behaviorist or an applied animal behaviorist.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	Is the litter box kept clean?  Clean it once or twice a week, and some cats have trouble with the clay type kitty litter.  As for the scratching clip the claws once a week, and soon they grow only to a nub, and you will only have to clip them maybe once a month.  Do not clip too short, get the Vet to show you how.  <br>  <br>  Never, never, never, de-claw a cat this is cruel and these claws are used as tools.  A cat is lost without them, because if he/she ever gets out theyare defenseless without them.|`|tRyMkBbaaa	From you question, it seems you have two litter boxes for two cats.  You should always have one more than you have cats so that there is always a clean litter box.  You can try added another litter box, but you really should take him to the vet; the vet is there to figure out what is wrong for you, since the vet is the doctor.|`|E6npEoDnaa	I understand the desire to trouble shoot it first.  Just wondering if you have changed the brand of litter at all?  Some cats are particular about it.  Are the litter boxes near each other?  If you can clean them, separate them it might help.  If you isolate your cat in a room with the box, maybe you could get him to use it so it's marked with his scent and he will reuse it?  This one is a toughie, but it also might sort itself out on it's own.  I have seen products to promote your pets to go in the box, that might be an option to encourage him too.<br>  <br>  One other thought, what about putting a different brand of litter in one of the boxes?  Possibly that might work too!|`|gfEiw1vTaa	Maybe he's severely cross-eyed.  haha wouldn't that be horrible.<br>  <br>  what is around the litterbox, is it carpet? or hardwood floor?  If it's a carpet, or some soft type of flooring i would put some news paper or maybe a flat of some old linoleum under his litter box, --> in a big enough area  that covers more than where he is doing his business now.  The change in texture to a non absorbent may make him climb into the litter box.  This is a matter of pet psychology, it's nothing a vet could treat, it would be more of a pet trainer issue.
TCa1xpFxaa	I'm sorry to hear this, he is so young to already have aggressive behavior.  This is for sure something you need to nip in the butt because I fear it will only get worse.  I would keep doing what your doing with having people around when hes eating, he needs to get use to it.  Also I would stomp and yell no, take him a couple notches down!!!|`|4360cf3c4091cff956ff8bf91dd7789faa	You should make your puppy associate people near his food as a positive experience. While he is eating, try to offer him a tasty treat in or near his food bowl. The treat is good and so when you approach the bowl, he should think "Oh good, I may get a treat!". You must not do this every time though, or he will learn to expect it and not to eat his regular food. <br>  A short while after the meal, you should do a fun activity which you both like doing. A game of tug-of-war, for example. Then the puppy will associate food with something fun to do, and therefore will probably lower his food aggression rate.<br>  Always remember to make him stand, sit, or lie down quietly before you give him his food. If not, he will learn that the noiser he gets, the sooner he gets food (and with a Rottie voice, you know how loud things can get!). Commands like "Stay" and "Wait" are very useful in this situation.|`|s76aC4G8aa	He's becoming food aggressive, so the worse thing you can do is pick him up while he's trying to eat, that's a sure way to get bitten and the wrong way to show who's boss.<br>  <br>  First of all, you need to establish yourselves as pack leaders, you need to show him that you control the food.  Get his bowl and put potatoe chips in them, stand over him and have him watch you eating out of his bowl you are showing him that you are the leader, you eat first, then you feed him.  You make him sit and he must wait until you put the bowl down, he must be calm before he's allowed to eat.  Put his bowl down and stand over his bowl, but both feet on either side of his bowl, then allow him to eat at your command.  by standing over his bowl you are "claiming his food" and therefore you are the boss.<br>  <br>  You must do this several times until he no longer reacts when you go near his bowl and you must be able to take his food away also.  <br>  <br>  However, I don't recommend continuously taking his bowl away because teasing him will make him possessive.<br>  <br>  Be the BOSS, learn how to be the pack leader and read Cesar's book, also watch Dog Whisperer on Nat Geo channel, another good show is "It's me or the Dog" on Animal Planet Saturday nights.  <br>  <br>  Also when training, using the word NO can make the dog think his name is NO and eventually they stop responding.  Try a strong sound like AH AH, say it Loud and mean it, they will respond to it better than NO.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|jfRYL4B4aa	When he growls say, or actually maybe you should yell, NO!  Make sure it's really loud and firm.  You want him to realize that you are NOT HAPPY with what he did and he did a bad thing.  And after you say/yell that you can put him outside or in a kennel, or a little time out place, for a while.  Good luck!|`|d5ba2646881527dee823be63029d7049aa	put the dam dog out  of his misery because once they act that way it wont be long till someone really gets hurt  by this dog   if you dont pls by all means keep your home owners insurance paid up.

M3jRtq2Aaa	Ask your vet for his preference.  They all have different ideas on this. <br>  I personally give one DA2PP at 8 weeks and another at 16 weeks.  Then I go to my vet for the rabies.  This is for my own dogs. I never do another DA2PP or DHPPC. I do all puppy wormings at 2wks, 3wks, 5wks, 7wks and then once a month for all the dogs. I never do KC vaccines.<br>  <br>  If I am selling the litter, I will take the whole litter in at 7-8weeks for the litter shots and checkup before they go to their new home. <br>  <br>  I do have to admit that after one of the neighbors had several dogs die from parvo a couple of years back, I did a single dose parvo vaccine for all my dogs as a booster.  I really don't think they would have needed it, but I did it just in case. None of mine ever got sick even before the booster vaccine, but several dogs in the area died from the disease. One neighbor had 6 out of his 8 dogs die from it.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Most vets nowadays are enlightened enough to follow the latest vaccination protocols and would only be giving your puppy the core vaccines.  If so, he'd still be getting one needle with 4 vaccines in it for his 2nd and 3rd set of shots.  He'd get rabies at 16 weeks, but shouldn't get it in conjunction with his other shot because it's too hard on a dog's system.  But your vet should be explaining all this to you, especially if this is your 1st puppy.|`|8X082V81aa	Your vet can give you a schedule of when your pup will need shots, wormings, and heartworm preventative. Each set is given at the same time.|`|9eAe617Daa	Normally dogs are given 2 vaccines each year.  One is a combination of several vaccines DHLP (Distemper, Hepatitis, Leptospirosis, Parainflueza, Parvovirus) and a second vaccine for rabies.  <br>  <br>  When puppies are small, they are given the DHLP series in three doses.  The first shot is usually given when the puppy is 6-8 weeks old.  The second shot is given three weeks later and the third shot three weeks after the second. <br>  <br>  My puppy also received his first rabies shot the same day he received his third DHLP shot when he was 14 weeks old.  His shots were given when he was 8 weeks, 11 weeks and 14 weeks.   My husband bought me a second puppy for christmas and she was 6 weeks old so she received her second and third shot when she was 9 and 12 weeks old.  <br>  <br>  Find out if you have a low cost vetenarian service in your community.  We found out after paying the vet for puppy shots that the mobile unit that goes around town every saturday giving rabies shots for $5 and DHP shots for $10 includes puppies as well as dogs.  Perhaps this could save you a few dollars.<br>  <br>  If you plan to board your dog in a kennel they will also be required to have a bordetella (kennel cough) vaccine.  My puppy was vaccinated for bordetella along with his first DHLP shot when he was 8 weeks old by the breeder before we bought him.   <br>  <br>  Good Luck with your new puppy!
AA11984336	I think this needs to be said. There isn't any such thing as a free puppy. If you can't afford a re-homing or adoption fee, how are you going to afford getting the dog vaccinated?

Dkb2ZR3Daa	Unfortunately the only way to get an accurate reading is to do it rectally. <br>  Use a digital thermometer as they are much quicker. <br>  Also try to find another hand to hold the cat for you-or even use a towel and wrap up the kitty with only butt hanging out. (cats really don't like their temp being taken) Use some kind of lube-if the only thing you have is Vaseline go for it-skip out on the lotions though.<br>  There is a center hole which is the anus(which is the one you want to stick it into to) and two other smaller holes on each side of the anus(anal gland).<br>  It's really not that bad...<br>  And for people saying that only a vet or technician should do it are wrong-its a part of necessary care for sick animals that were sent home to be monitored, and a part of owner compliance.<br>  <br>  Edit: To jue7rc- Taking a temperature on an animal is not rocket science, nor a "procedure".... And I assure you that your vet or technicians would feel the same way. With a digital thermometer the end where a person hold it is always larger preventing it from "going to far" Also with the proper use of lubrication it can do very-little damage...<br>  We ask many clients/owners of cats and dogs to take temperatures at home. I'm sure the person who asked was looking at an alternate method of getting a temp. As some people are "grossed" out at the idea or thought of it, and not asking because they lack knowledge.|`|YBcB0732aa	No, unfortunately the only accurate way to to take your cat's temperature is rectally.|`|AA11451457	DONT take your cats temperateure yourself, take it to a vet|`|WqGxGJkbaa	To - "Keep my soldier safe" - are you really suggesting that someone who thinks they can take a cat's temperature under its "arm" should be let loose with a rectal thermometer?  If it is inserted incorrectly or pushed in too far it can cause serious damage - I am surprised that a vet tech would not appreciate the danger of an untrained person performing such a procedure.<br>  <br>  Edit - There seems to be an amazing amount of "Vet Techs" in the USA - what qualifications do you have in veterinary treatment?  Your profile says you merely "work" in a vet clinic and that you are in college studying two different subjects.  In the UK to obtain proper veterinary qualifications actually takes longer than it does to become a doctor.  I am confused about whether "Vet Techs" actually have any real knowledge of the subject.|`|wrhG6b1laa	no you have to go with their back end.

nvPHccPbaa	I think dogs have been bred for centuries to do different tasks. There is no one test that you can say, "Well that dog is stupid and that one is smart."<br>  <br>  For example, many people equate obedience with smarts. OK, so we have a Border Collie who obeys instantaneously and a Malamute who ponders the command first. Does this make the Border Collie smart and the Malamute dumb? No. (I'm not debating the Border Collie's intelligence. This is an example.) Shepherds needed a dog who would obey them quickly. A dog who didn't obey might instead obey his instincts and keep herding the sheep--in the wrong direction and give the shepherd more work. A Malamute, on the other hand, lived in a harsh environment where many times he had to rely on himself to survive. If something his owner asked was stupid, he might decide not to do it. This was survival.<br>  <br>  One dumb and one smart? No, not really. With all the variations in dogs it's difficult to call one smart and one not. <br>  <br>  A Bloodhound escapes and gets lost. Is he stupid? No, but he's been trained for centuries to think with his nose. Trainers valued the dog who wouldn't get distracted from the scent. But this isn't too helpful when your dog follows a scent and gets lost.<br>  <br>  To use your example, the owner of a Black Russian Terrier welcomes some friends in. The BRT eyes them suspiciously and watches them. His breed has been developed to be a good watch and guard dog. He doesn't run up and trust every person who comes in the door. This could save his or his handlers' life in a guarding situation.<br>  <br>  ADD: I think a retriever who is unresponsive to a ball would be called "unusual." Possibly unintelligent, but I think there are other factors that contribute to intelligence. It may just not be into balls. I think sometimes dogs that are obsessive-compulsive about balls and retrieving have a few less brain cells.|`|14Z1vZjLaa	I think my chi is rather smart because she is a really quick learner. She can observe her surroundings and learn.  Once she jumped on the car seat once, every time we open the car door, she jumps to the back seat, where I usually sit.  I am the one who always lets her out to go potty so at night, (she sleeps in the living room) if she needs to go potty bad, she will whine and scratch my door until I let her go potty.  She never scratches at anyone elses door though.  After she eats something from the floor she always looks guilty when I pet her.  And, whenever someone is cooking, she "begs" with her paw and looks at you with adoring eyes!|`|27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	for your first question...what defines a smart dog.....my answer is the name jack russell terrier...jk.. though they are very smart infact too smart for their own good.  i think of a smart dog as one that can understand what you are saying and knows what you mean....and has the ability to learn many tricks....my jack russell doesn't chase the tennis ball but yet she is really smart.....she chases the laser pointer....so i think a unresponsive dog could still be smart it could just not be in their nature that they like to chase a ball or something...my lab chases a ball but she is still really smart..so basically it doesn't matter on the responsiveness or the unresponssiveness of the dog its the individual dog and its nature
7cm4dZVaaa	From your avatar and choice of song, I am assuming that you are female, so to that song I would wear some long, full, fancy dress, sort of like what she was wearing in the video.  I think about free style reining, but I have NO creativity.  What if you were to list the maneuvers for a reining run.... like run down and stop, back up, slow circles, fast circles, change direction, roll back right, roll back left, spin left, spin right on, on separate index cards and shuffling them to see what order might come up?  Then you would only have to figure out how to connect them.  Otherwise, I bet you could get by with just using your favorite printed reining pattern, there are a lot of them out there now, someone would have to be really thinking to figure out......"hummmm, that looks like old pattern number 6 to me.)

Unfortunately thousands of people do this without a thought for their dogs welfare. The people who work full time and do not make provision for a dog to be walked in their absence are totally selfish.<br>  <br>  At present the weather is cold, consequently the dog will come to no harm in the car. If he did this all the year round his dog would be dead by now. The dog will be less bored in the car because there are people passing. In view of this I think that he will be happier in the car than being in the house on it's own.<br>  <br>  Before you speak to him you should make more enquiries, its possible that he does take his dog for a walk in his lunch hour and that the people who you have asked are unaware of this.

If you know of a good place this dog can spend the day rather than the car, like doggy day care, you can offer the phone number or address to him.  That would be a neighborly way to handle it. <br>  He might not get seen walking the dog because he probably sneaks and does this when others are busy.|`|yAuLv2GPaa	I have had a similar experience with a co-worker who left his Lab puppy in his truck all day while he worked. I did'nt know the guy. He'd just started working at this place and I have no idea exactly how long he'd been working or bringing the dog with him. He parked next to me one morning and when I went to my car at break, saw the dog and was shocked. I asked whose Bronco was parked next to me and the few people outside did'nt know but someone told me they'd seen the dog left in the truck before all day. It was late Feb. and fairly nice out. Temperature was around 50 degrees. Windows were cracked and the dog had a food and water bowl in the back as well as a bed and a chew toy.<br>  At lunch I again went to my car to eat in peace and the fella soon came along and took the dog out for a walk while he ate his lunch which I watched him share with his puppy. When he put him back in the truck I told him what a cute kid he had there and a conversation about the dog just naturally occurred where it came out that the guy had been tossed out of his girlfriends house where he'd been paying all the bills until he lost his job.  Everyrthing was fine there until his savings were gone and she had to start paying her way as well as help him and she did'nt like it one bit so she threw him out the day before he started working at this place. He was in fact living in his truck with the dog and had nowhere he trusted to leave the little guy all day while he worked. With the weather not being harsh he worried about him but all went well this far and he'd be moving into an apartment of his own the following week when he got paid so he'd hoped it'd be alright. the owners had told him he could bring the dog as long as he did not bring him inside the plant or allow him to be anywhere near the driveway or the docks. They evan had suggested he tie him up on the backside of the building late in the day should it get too hot in his truck and later that week he did so, taking his breaks with the pup to make sure he was alright.<br>  Maybe you can try mentioning how cute the dog is just to break the silence and you'll find a similar situation. Some people are just too ignorant for words but there are times when what we're really looking at is a situation that requires a friendly hand up.|`|zon13nY2aa	Okay you're getting loads of answers and they're all quite mixed so I'm sure you're very confused about what to do.<br>  <br>  To all the people who said leaving a dog in a car all day without being attended to is okay, you are WRONG! It is cruelty and this guy is risking his dog overheating. The dog isn't getting any attention or interactive for the whole day. I know leaving a dog at home all day isn't exactly ideal either but at least there would be no risk of overheating, or being stolen (the reason I would never leave my dogs alone in the car even for a minute).<br>  <br>  I would be tempted to report him to the RSPCA immediately. I don't tolerate any kind of animal cruelty. However, I know you want to speak to him first, so...<br>  <br>  You need to be 100% sure of the facts. Is this a long term thing or is it something he is doing just while he moves house or something like that? Has the dog got a water bowl? Is he letting it out for a wee at all through the day?<br>  <br>  Once you know the facts then you're in a better position to take action. Send him an email saying:<br>  <br>  "I have noticed that you leave your dog alone in the car all day, every day, and I just want to express my concern. This is not an acceptable way of caring for a dog and I'm concerned about its welfare"...<br>  <br>  Something along those lines would sound ok. But you may be dealing with an idiot here and he might not give a damn. Then if you do decide to report it he will know it was you.<br>  <br>  If you report him without mentioning anything first then it will be anonymous and the warning he gets from the RSPCA will hopefully shock him into changing his ways!<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|2ff000f507e5e958f455f4ef122e9c3faa	This used to happen at a organisation I worked some years back.

If this guy is stupid enough to leave a dog in a car all day, I would not want to speak with him.  You don't know if he has any mental issues, I wouldn't want him to know who I was for that reason. Some people are just crazy.
rL1uzID4aa	Hi ,<br>  Well i found this really helpful guide ,its a really professional training called sit stay fetch , it teaches you how to train your dog by yourself ,   check it out at <a href="http://www.dogobediencetraining.co.nr" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogobediencetraining.co.nr</a>  , its a easy step by step book and videos.  Hope this helps you with your dog <br>  Good luck|`|Jt11VpYaaa	Maybe start using a crate.  Most dogs won't potty in their crate.  It is also important that you continue working on her training.  You can't quit trianing just because she isn't a baby anymore.<br>  <br>  Have you had her checked for a urinary tract infection?  There cold be some medical reason for her behavior.<br>  <br>  If she's peeing when you come near her then she has some serious fear issues, and you need to get a professional trainer to help you.  If you've had her for a year and haven't been abusing her then there should be no reason for her to urinate when you approach her.  Please get a trainer to help you.

If you have a doggie bed for your pet be sure he has a small blanket, even an old t-shirt will do so he has something that he can sleep with, roll around on something that is his and will make him feel safe.|`|74530f1c293522b59e9e263928bd2299aa	old socks.. mismatched socks.. dogs love them,  and they are free
AA11901352	Well the first problem is you don't know what kind of fish so letting you know how to care for them will be just a guide line here.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bristol-aquarists.org.uk/goldfish/goldfish.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bristol-aquarists.org.uk/gold...</a><br>  <br>  This web page shows different types.<br>  <br>  <br>  Water depends on the fish's adult size.  While 1" of fish rule may apply to many fish it doesn't apply to all.  Fancy goldfish need a minimum of 5 gallons of water each as an adult. (Around 6-8 inches more towards the smaller size)<br>  <br>  As for the food, depending on the fish.  The goldfish group including koi should be fed 3 times per day vs. other fish.  Usually what they can eat in 2-3 minutes.<br>   <br>  you can feed your fish when ever you wish.  It doesn't have to be the same time every day since fish in the wild don't eat like people at specific times.  They will eat when the opportunity presents itself.<br>  <br>  You should get your tank on a weekly water change of no more than 25% along with the gravel vacing.  (A siphone used to collect and remove fish poo and food wastes from the bottom of the tank)<br>  Remember a good dechlor/water conditioner should also be used in the replacement water.<br>  <br>  <br>  Generally any type of aquarium gravel is fine, including sand or river gravel.  Other larger rocks are ok as well, staying clear of limestone rocks.  Wash well prior to adding to the tank. <br>  <br>  Food will depend on the fish.  Some fish do not eat flakes or pellets and prefer brine, worms  or other live foods.  This is the key to keeping fish healthy.  Although many can be converted for flakes and pellets, some fish are plant eaters like many cold water fish are and will eat raw veggies like lettuce, spinach, carrots, zucchini, cukes peas oranges watermellons etc.  these items are great for all aquarium fish as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  No you do not need plants That is more of a personal preference however they do have benefits for shy fish or even baby fish (Fry)<br>  <br>  In general, some fish are bottom layer fish and simply prefer to remain towards the bottom of the tank.  Some prefer the middle and some the top.  Depends on the fish.  However if a top prefer fish remains on the bottom there could be a number of problems with the fish this would depend on the symptoms so it is impossiable to say.<br>  <br>  If you watch your fish you will just know when something is wrong.  All fish have their own personality.  You will just know, although a fish that is floating on its side is also another good indication something isn't right.  Also if they are not eating are changing color, have white fungus or spots, you will just know. <br>  <br>  Not all tanks have lids.  This also is not only a personal preference but also depends on your specific tank set up.  Including bowls.  (Most bowls don't have lids)  If you are keeping fish that tend to jump or get out of the tank, a lid is a requirement.  Some larger tanks that use stronger lighting sources have no glass tops since the heat of the lamps amplify the heat into the tank.  It is all a matter of how and what kind of fish you are keeping.<br>  <br>  No fish HAS to come up for air.  there are specific fish that have an additional organ that will allow them to take oxygen from the air when there is a lack of oxygen in the water, but none need to surface to breath.  Fish remove dissolved oxygen from the water via their gills.<br>  <br>  Your fish won't come up for air because they don't need to not because you don't have a lid.<br>  <br>  Your bowl I am assuming you don't have a filter for this bowl.  Bowls can be used for certain fish (although most will disagree here) however bowls don't really make good homes for fish.  Mostly due to space and water conditions.  Since you have a bowl, water changes of 50% every 2-3 days is really needed as well as using a turkey baster to remove the excess waste from the bottom.<br>  <br>  You really need a test kit even if you get the testing strips.  this will help you help your fish should something go wrong.  Knowing the water params is important.<br>  <br>  If at all possiable, I would try to get your fish into a 10 gallon filtered tank.  This really would be better for both of them.<br>  Remember you want to cycle the tank prior to putting them in or you will need to keep an eye on the water conditions.  Test to ensure ammonia and nitrites aren't spiking.<br>  <br>  Here is a good link for cycling the tank.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck with your fish!<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  Just wanted to add, goldfish have no stomachs and really should be fed 2-3 times per day.  It is almost impossiable to over feed fish since like people, once a fish is full it will not eat more than it can.  Goldfish are one of the fish that can eat all day long with no health problems since what they eat comes right out with very little neutrients absorbed.  What you need to be sure of to help keep their digestive tracts clear is the veggies and fiber.  this pushes food thu their systems.  To say one pinch of food is not a guide line.  Feed what they will eat in a 2-3 minute period which more than likely is more than a pinch.  Generally fish will eat the volume of one eye at a feeding. (Tough to judge here) you will eventually just know how much.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	To be honest they sound like fancy Goldfish<br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Goldfish" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Goldfish</a><br>  Never buy a fish if you don't know its species, final adult size and everything on how to care for it. They are complex animals.<br>  <br>  1. Depends on species, if this is a fancy Goldfish, at 4-5cm you have tiny babies which will grow and grow and make a HUGE amount of mess. For a pair of fancy Goldfish you ideally need 25-30 US gallons or larger. Fancies should get 15-25cm long excluding fins.<br>  <br>  2. This is down to your own discretion. Assuming Goldfish, they think they have a bottomless appetite but overfeeding can cause internal disorders. A small pinch once or twice a day will do.<br>  <br>  3. Up to you.<br>  <br>  4. With Goldfish, once a week with a syphon, that's if they were in that proper fish tank. Which they're not, they're in a bowl, which means you need to do DAILY water changes of around 50% to keep ammonia levels down which will otherwise burn the fish's gill tissue and effectively suffocate it. This is why unfiltered bowls are inadequate surroundings for fish. Either the ammonia/nitrites kill them, or the stress of the constantly changing environment does.<br>  <br>  5. In a bowl, none, you need bare bottomed to try and keep it clean. In a proper fish tank either large gravel (too large to be swallowed by an adult Goldfish), large river rocks or bare bottomed is necessary for Goldfish.<br>  <br>  6. High quality pellets and flake and blanched vegetables like zucchini are good for Goldfish.<br>  <br>  7. No. Goldfish eat plants anyway.<br>  <br>  8. Lethargy is a sign your water quality is bad, inevitable in a fish bowl.<br>  <br>  9. By them sitting on the bottom of the tank or gasping at the surface, odd marks like dark spots, ragged fins, or lesions/spots on the fish can all be signs of bacterial infections or parasites, all generally caused by bad water quality.<br>  <br>  10. Not sure what you mean by the lid thing, they won't come to the surface if they're being poisoned unless it's to gasp for air. They have gills so filter oxygen straight from the water column. I would imagine in a day or so you'll notice either dead fish or fish gasping at the surface as their gill tissue is damaged beyond repair.<br>  <br>  Ditch the bowl, give the fish back to the store, research proper fish care. A proper filtered fish tank needs to be set up and put through the nitrogen cycle for several weeks before it's safe for fish to be added.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	1. Fantail are the fancy variety of goldfish. They grow 6-8 inches, and produce a lot of waste. Two require 30 gallons minimum with double the filtration. Always treat water with water conditioner.<br>  <br>  2. Feed the fish twice a day, as much as they will eat in a few minutes. Always remove uneaten food as it will break down and ruin water quality.<br>  <br>  3. You can feed them once in the morning when you get up, and once in the evening before you go to bed.<br>  <br>  4. Weekly partial water changes of about 25% They are dirty fish and these water changes are necessary to keep nitrate levels in check.<br>  <br>  5. You can buy ornaments and gravel where you bought your fish. Rocks found outside may not be safe or carry parasites.<br>  <br>  6. I prefer to feed goldfish sinking pellets.<br>  <br>  7. Goldfish will likely munch on any live plants added to the tank.<br>  <br>  8. Staying at the bottom of the tank may be normal for a fish in a new environment, but considering they are goldfish and they are in a bowl, it's probably due to high ammonia. Ammonia is lethal to fish. <br>  <br>  9. Staying at the bottom, lethargy, and unusual red, black, or white markings will point towards sickness.<br>  <br>  ~The best thing you can do right now is return those fish. A bowl is the worst environment for them. No surface area, little oxygen in the water, high ammonia...the fish will suffer from ammonia poisoning and could suffocate.|`|2Itepwgsaa	If you want to grow them faster,use larger fish tank. Feed them variety of foods to let them have many nutrients in their body. Feeding fish is them most complicated one,do not feed too much or feeding a little, i think you must feed it every morning and afternoon or go back to the store you bought it and ask things about it you do not understand.The amount of food you must give depends whether it is concentrated, mine is concentrates so I feed them little. Have an aerator because I think the oxygen present in the water is too little to supply your fish's needs or use aquatic live plants. You can determine if your fish is sick if its actions are changed into clumsy ones. Pebbles are good for fish tanks and best for me.If you get some in the street,clean it because it might have chemicals that are dangerous for your fish.Research about things about fishes so you can relate. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|aFslyRbMaa	about 5 gallon perferbli more <br>  about 2flakes per fish<br>  flakes<br>  every month<br>  gravel<br>  if in the morning its by the light like mine but otherwise they are stressed or not healthy<br>  no the food will float <br>  no they are eating dust somthing like that its fine|`|fSJrgVU7aa	Most of your questions cannot be answered unless we know the exact species of fish you have. A bowl is not good for any fish at all. Size of the aquarium needed, types of food, additional items needed (heater, filter etc.) all depend on the species of fish. Fish extract dissolved oxygen from the water so no they do not need to "come to the surface" for air. For good comprehensive info on setting up a new aquarium take a look at www.fishlore.com. If you look through their listings and pics of various fish species you should be able to find exactly what fish you have and what their specific requirements will be.|`|tMSv2jMnaa	hi there... well if its a bowl then fill the bowl  and leave about 5 inches from above... and give them 2 balls of food twice in a day.. just sprinkle the food in the pot the fish will come and the eat food it self.... since its a bowl with u then u need to clean the bowl as soon as u see the color change or change it twice a week.. the rocks should be smooth like in texture not rough u can go for small pebbles not big ones .  well the food depends on what they had been eating before u bought them .. the change of food may cause harm sometimes so ask the person what he had been providing ur fishes before u bought them and ask the person even about the quantity he had been giving them ...  its not important to keep a plant but if u want ur bowl to look good u can use plants which u can find at an aquarium shop though. well it means that it is tired and that they are taking some rest nothing to worry if they are still for sometime. well its not possible to say when a fish is sick . but u can find when its gonna die turns upside down . yep if u don't have a lid  then its ok but i suggest u to buy a oxygen pump soon because it would be better .and the pump will help in long life for ur fishes ...  fishes breath through gills so they take oxygen from water it self . so keep changing water twice  a  week... all the best with ur fishes.................. take-care

You might make sure your dam has plenty of water and is drinking, and resting, also that the room and bed aren't too warm. remember she has 4 little pups laying beside her heating her up too. Is she actign right otherwise, licking them and all?  It's always a good idea to have a pet person with experience come over to check things out. they might notice something you haven't. congrats on your new delivery.|`|4JFwnmqVaa	Yea that all sounds normal. I would make sure she has a lot of water. Nursing those babies will make her thirsty. The room could be warmer then she is use to as well.
zWFJBlJZaa	Yes, it is possible to have more than one type of infection going on at the same time in the ear.<br>  <br>  Ear infections can be quite difficult to cure and often are reoccurring especially in drop eared dogs.  The flap shuts out the circulation of air which then allows moisture and dirt to breed bacteria. <br>  <br>  You do not want to put water in the ear canal as their ear canals are shaped like the letter "L" and water sits in the horizontal section.<br>  <br>  Peroxide is okay to use provided that the ear is not red and/or bloody. The peroxide will probably make her a little crazy because many dogs don't like that fizzy sound in their ears.<br>  <br>  Until you get to the Vet you'd probably be much better using a little warm oil in the ear canal and rubbing/massaging the base of the ear gently between your fingers and then wiping out the crud with a cotton ball.<br>  <br>  Once you get this cleared up, please keep after the maintenance.  Ear infections can lead to deafness and can become serious enough to require surgery to clear up.|`|tMtBe1lKaa	POOR BABY!<br>  It is possible to have two types of infection. There could also be a bacterial infection which I think is more common. <br>  <br>  As far as the peroxide goes, I'm not sure. I would ask or look it up. Maybe someone else on here knows. If you have a feed store nearby, sometimes they carry products to help. I've treated my cats with medicines they sell for other animals, but my mom's a nurse, so I have her, plus lots of medical books to help with proper diagnosis and dosing. The people at feed stores are usually well versed in pet care needs, often better than people at pet stores, at least here. They might have some ideas to get you through the weekend. If your dog gets a fever though, or is constantly in pain, I would take her in asap.<br>  <br>  ADDED: You can warm olive oil and put it in her ears. I do this when my kids have infections. <br>  Best of luck.|`|4JFwnmqVaa	Go to your local health food store and buy a bottle of silver biotics colloidal silver. Put a couple of drops in the ear 2-3 X per day. Or put it on a cotton swab and swab around where it is red, the drops are better. This will clear up almost any infection, yeast or other wise. Yes it worked on pets.
4JFwnmqVaa	Maltese are very good with kids. They have a high enough energy level that they are playful and fun. Unless you are mean to them they won't be mean to you or those around you.|`|FaqoZWM4aa	ok...everyone has had basically the most wonderful ideas. Myself, I have a Blue Heeler/Australian Shephard and he has been a ball of fun, but take the important things into consideration;<br>  Are you going to pay attention to him/her?<br>  How much time will you have to give him/her?<br>  <br>  Basically, look at the other answers to find what you need. Australian Shephard/Blue Heeller's have a tendancy to nip just a little, but that is quite fixable. Just a LIGHT smack to the nose and say "No Biting!" in a firm tone of voice, don't yell at your dog, otherwise it might become timid of you. But my dog is really fun to play with, loves people and has lots of energy. Make sure that at night you wire your dog down by getting them to run at the park or something. That is how I do it. I get Jake to "stay" and I'll go across the tennis court and call him to me. Works like a charm.

But some owners will make them that way.  But if you get a young puppy properly socialize it and train it.  Then it defiantly won't be mean.  But they will play bite and stuff while they are teething.  So all puppies go through that.  So you have to be firm to not let them bite you.  Supply them with lots of chew toys!<br>  All puppies are playful and cute.  <br>  You need to specify more.  Example: Do you want a dog with long hair or a dog with short hair?  Do you want a small, medium, large or extra large dog?  How much time do you want to spend exercising and training your dog?  We need more info on what your lifestyle is so we can better recommend a breed.<br>  But here are the breeds I recommend:<br>  <br>  Small Dogs: Toy Poodle, Yorkie and a Shih-Tzu.  They are all Intelligent, easy to train, playful, cute, small and don't shed.  They don't require a lot of exercise.  But do need quite a bit of grooming.  <br>  <br>  Medium Dogs: Sheltie and Border Collie.  They both need a lot of exercise.  They are both intelligent.  Border Collies need a lot of mental stimulation.  Otherwise they get bored.  They need trained lot of tricks, Agility, etc.  Shelites also need trained.  Both shed and need groomed.  Both are friendly and playful.  Sheltie makes a good guard dog.  <br>  <br>  Large Dogs:  Golden Retriever, Dobermann, German Shepard.  All of them shed.  All need a good brush a day.  All are very intelligent and need exercise.  German Shepards need a lot of mental stimulation also.  Dobermann and Geman Shepard make great guard dogs.  Where a Golden Retriever loves people. <br>  <br>  Extra Large Dogs:  Great Dane.  Need exercise.  Shed but require minimal grooming.  Do like people but if needed will make a good guard dog.  Eager to please.  Smart.  <br>  <br>  Anyways those are the breeds I would recomend without knowing your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Make sure before you buy a dog.  You research the breed througly to make sure it properly fits your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with finding the right puppy!<br>  Hope I helped!|`|eyZhiXYpaa	No puppy is 'mean', if a dog grows to become 'mean' it is entirely the owners fault for no training him as a pup.<br>  <br>  Research on the internet and make sure you chose a breed that will suit your individual life style.<br>  <br>  Things to consider before you buy:-<br>  <br>  Do I have time?<br>  Do I have the money?<br>  Do I want an active dog i.e. am I active etc.?

0nIwKd5Uaa	I would recommend introducing them through 2 separate cages. Same sex chinchillas can live happily together if grown up together or introduced properly. When getting the new younger chin if you can put the new chin into a cage that both chins can actually see each other, but don't let them touch as of yet. I would let them see but not interact for about 1 to 2 weeks. After that period of time allow the younger chin to be in the older chins cage for about 20 minutes allow the younger chin to walk in on her own. There might be a slight scuffle as even in the chin world dominance does happen. Don't leave them alone. After the 2 weeks you can also start playing with the chins together outside of the cage, so they get used to being around each other. Do this also for a week or 2.  After you get to see that they are completely comfortable with each other then and only then would i allow the younger chin to stay in the older chins cage.<br>  <br>  You will find that both the younger and older chin will start looking for each other, if you notice that happening you can let them be together for longer periods of time.<br>  <br>  One more thing make sure the sex of both chins. They breed like crazy and your house old chin population could get out of control and very quickly. <br>  <br>  If i wasn't clear enough feel free to e-mail me anytime with any questions.|`|f5d911179b5535ec45cbb6bd90b28248aa	Depends on the age difference.

We found out later she had some problem with her back. I know it wasn't caused by the tickling, but maybe the reaction that she had was a sign to the back trouble. Our precious Honeybunch was born with hydrocephalus. She wasn't supposed to live but a very short time, weeks or months. We had her for almost 4 years. She was a very special dog.

If not, he should be the one putting down the food bowl every day.

Have him work with her, with you enforcing his commands as needed.  Give her treats when she obeys him without your interference, not when you have to physically make her obey your uncle.<br>  <br>  Look into getting professional help in training, if needed.

116b812be758132bbf13bfd2e961b1b8aa	Your ball python is in shed, but you need to address the dehydration right away.  Snakes lose a lot of fluids when they shed their skin, so make sure he always has clean water, especially when shedding.  You may even want to soak him in warm (75 -80 F) water right after the eyes clear but before he sheds.  As for not eating, that's not uncommon in ball pythons.  As long as he's healthy, an adult ball pyhton can go without eating for over a year without any ill effects.|`|AA10851367	The blue eyes sound like the typical signs of the beginning of a shed. First off, take him to a vet. It takes a long time for a ball python to become dehydrated, so if it has happened, that's a sign that he's in dire straights. It's possible that the "dehydration" is actually his old skin about to come off - if the humidity isn't correct in his cage, then the old, dry skin might stay stuck to him when it should have come off. If that's the case, you can try soaking him in some warm (not hot) water for about an hour. You can do this by getting a piece of tupperware or similar storage container large enough for him, poke some holes in the top, and fill it half way with water. Just keep an eye on him while he's in there to make sure everything's going all right. When he comes out, some pieces of skin may come off on their own, and you can let him slither through your hands or a wet towel to help him along. However, even if that sounds like what's going on, I would recommend you take him to the vet anyway to be sure, especially because he hasn't been eating. Ball pythons sometimes have a reputation for being difficult to get feeding, and they can go a long time without food, but it's very important that you get your snake to a vet if that's what's going on. He might have to be force fed and rehydrated to get him healthy again, which really requires a vet, and the vet can also give you some tips on how to get him to feed on his own again.|`|4360cf3c4091cff956ff8bf91dd7789faa	When his/her eyes turn a cloudy blue colour, this means the will SHED and all snakes naturally loose their appetite before they shed.

Am liebsten mag er Papierkartons, die er dann erstmal zerrupft und es sich dann drinnen gemütlich macht.<br>  <br>  Meine Katze dagegen mag alle Arten von Tüten (Papier, Plastik ...) und h?lt sich da drin gerne auf. Sie hat mich mal richtig erschreckt, als ich Weihnachtsp?ckchen eingepackt habe. Da ist sie die Tüte gekrochen, in der ich nach dem Packen die Geschenke einpacken wollte (eine recht gro?e Tüte also). Naja, ich habe das nicht gesehen, will mir die Tüte schnappen Peppels maut und kommt herausgesprungen ... und mir damit nen Riesenschrecken gemacht.

Sie fühlen sich wohl wenn sie "unsichtbar" sind, da sie nicht nur j?ger sondern auch gejagter sein k?nnen. Katzen nehmen ihre umwelt viel deutlicher wahr als wir menschen. Sie sehen besser, sie h?hren um einiges besser und spüren dinge instinktiv. Will meinen - wenn wir menschen ein "ruhiges" fleckchen zum buch lesen und entspannen gefunden haben , h?rt , riecht, sieht und spürt eine katze hier immer noch 1000 dinge, die wir gar nicht wahr nehmen und sie bleibt halt deshalb gerne in der eben beschriebenen versteckten lauerposition.<br>  <br>  Miau|`|091db0ebf51987fc325d0cd415eefef6aa	Oh ja, das kenn ich auch!

e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	How do they cool down? Is that the question? They go in the shade, and under brush and logs, to get out of the sun. Just as snakes need warmth to be able to move, too much warmth can kill them. So they cool down by getting away from heat sources, by burrowing in the earth, swimming in cool water, or going in the shade of rocks, bushes, grasses, and trees.|`|2d231dbd73d92bb518d1417545915199aa	Because they cool down by getting away from the heat source (sunlight or lamplight or heating pad) it's important to have a warm side and a cool side to your snake's habitat.<br>  <br>  For a treat, you can put warm water in your snake's water dish-my kingsnake goes nuts for a warm water bath (not hot).  He'll splash and carry on like a big goof and then go bask on his log.|`|4360cf3c4091cff956ff8bf91dd7789faa	Snakes, lik all reptiles, are cold blooded which means their body temprature changes with the heat around them. Their mtabolisim slows down when they are colder so they bask or oak up the sun in the morning to make them warm up. If they get too hot they crawl (or in this case slither) behind or nder a rock, rotting log, or anything thats dosen't get the sun to them. Thats why if you DO own a snake ensure it has a rock and a hollowlog to hide in/under as well a basking lamp to warm themselves up.|`|VNVCjoVLaa	snakes are naturally cold-blooded.|`|b5U6m1jXaa	well they regulate there tempurter by there sourondings so if it is 75 degrees thats how warm they are and if it's 60 degrees thats how warm they are...get it hope this helped
ILm6FTdJaa	In order to fix the problem, you must better understand the cause of it. You mentioned that he slipped once coming in the house. When it's time to come in, try throwing a towel on the floor in front of the doorway. Run out and leash him and bring him in and wipe his paws down with the towel. Repeating this every time you bring him in should get him accustomed to the process. Then after a couple of weeks he should run in knowing the towel will be there and he won't go flying! Hope this helps!|`|2ef97aeb1a649982da219c1f98d30f3aaa	To him this is some sort of game.

dFh8Herpaa	Yes you can bath your pup, probably best place would be your sink since you have a young puppy, do not use too hot water dogs are sensitive to heat.  Also keep it fun and you do not need to over fill sink to wash a pup.  Your puppy does not need to think he is going to drown.  I have a standard poodle and I figure he gets bathed as a young pup every two weeks since he was 5 weeks old.  Depending on your breed you may not want or need to wash that often.|`|27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	you can probably give your dog a bath already ...my suggestion is to buy baby shampoo just incase your dog is sensitive because the other shampoos say no to give it until 8 weeks old or ten weeks old or maybe twelve ..something like that ( even though your dog is older u should still be careful) i gave my pup a bath with baby shampoo when she was eight monthes old and she was fine...she didn't like the bath...but most dogs never do...but she was fine and she smelled really good|`|AA12004782	yuppers|`|VUG0RiHIaa	go ahead give the cute little doggy a bath. but don't let her scare herself when she is in the bath. my dog is scared of water when i wash my hands but when we go fishing we really have to keep a good eye on him to keep him from trying to swim.

DoQnLtr8aa	if the dog is just being playful, not aggressive, and your kitten is not declawed, they should be alright together as soon as your kitten is an adult cat.  I have 2 dogs and 2 cats.  When one of my dogs gets hyper, he likes to chase and hold down one of the cats.  He lets up right away, and they all just run and play.  He tried that with the other cat, and he let him know that he didnt like that idea, so he aviods that cat.  If you're just trying to get him to lighten up, try making a loud noise if you see it happening, each time.  Try a command like "gentle," and pull back on his collar if he's getting rough.  Good luck!|`|Sb8eqERSaa	Unfortunately until the kitten gets bigger & wiser she is in danger. I had this problem once. It did not end well!

He sometimes does it too when he want's to eat|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	He wants to let you know that you should be feeding good quality healthy dog food!|`|b3d1ea6b376eb1836aad3ca778084cccaa	Don't know but sounds cute.|`|27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	so does mine..and then when i do something stupid or something i sware she laughs at me because she opens her mouth and starts making this huffing sound ( no i m not crazy) but seriously ya i think that they were trying to prove that dogs can laugh on national geographics.....my dog does the same thing..my other one talks to me by barking ..she has different kinds of barks so you can identify her main point like her sassy bark, hunting bark , and so on ...i found that when my dog opens her mouth she is either panting or is happy that im there|`|86d3fa5e8ea3caa23a01700c8f24522daa	Pick  "key" words and use them all the time.... same word.<br>  <br>  Example:    "what does Rocco want?" <br>     'go out?'    'treat?'   "drink?"  or  "water?"  "No"  "Hush or Quiet"    "Good boy or girl"   "Atta dog"  <br>  'Walk?"<br>  <br>  Also teach   "Come"   " Sit "   " Down"   "Wait"    "Heel"  or "walk"  without pulling.......  <br>   these can make make a HUGE difference in getting your dog to have manners.    "Get Off" me or the couch  is not the same as lie "Down." <br>  <br>  The major word  in training is be CONSISTENT. <br>  <br>    Don't say Come and then use 'Here, here"  or   and he's loose in the yard and running 55 miles per hour away  from you....  you can't control him unless he's been to many obedience classes !<br>  <br>  However !   If you yell  "Come"  and he doesn't and it is an emergency (meaning you do not have time or it is too dangerous to walk him down)   Yell  "Treat!   Treat! "  and try to rattle paper, a can,  anything, or hold your  hand out  like you do when you have one. <br>  <br>      Yell,  Good Boy,  Treat,  Come !    Not   get yur **** over heyah,  I'm a goin' to kill you!    Next time, he'll speed up to 70 mph and keep going....... LMAO ! <br>  <br>  So, yes, he may be talking to you.    When you ask him a question,  and he gets excited,   say  "show me" and encourage him to go ahead of you.... takes a while.   Take him to the door, the water bowl, the treat cabinet,  etc.  When he gets excited at the spot,  ask him repeatedly  "out?"  out ?  and open the door to go potty..... <br>  <br>  You'll get it.   This will open communication up.<br>  <br>  Oh, and mine have got me trained to  go give them a treat.  So if they do it too many time in 1 day,   I say  No, treat,  No, treat and don't give them one.   They understand that, too.  You should see the sad face !|`|aTCKfvX4aa	untill he does actually talk you,ll never know but they do try to mimic you sometimes when your going to yawn do it in front of him make sure he,s looking right at you and nine times out of ten he,ll yawn back at you|`|ORDP5wMRaa	My dog keeps telling me 'aroo aroo aroo ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff' - I also want to know what he is trying to tell me. <br>  <br>  I think 'aroo' means "kennedy" (his name) and 'ruff' means "Eat!"<br>  I'd better tell him to add 'growl' to mean 'now!'|`|dc0kzmnVaa	Hes trying to tell you to get that syringe out of your arm. I'm kidding, lmao.
345067d84433b48f76b2fc03b0d36bf5aa	You will need to socialize your dog. Take him to the park and have people approach him slowly and give him treats for being calm. He'll get used to having people around soon. <br>  <br>  Check out a book on puppy socialization - the good news is that he's still very young, so it will be easier than socializing an older dog. Good luck!|`|27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	o you mean the overly friendly labrador who can't get weighed at the vet because they are too full of wiggles because they are excited that they are meeting a new person and the one who goes to a dog park to socialize with people instead of dogs...thats my lab hehe..um ya labs are kinda disobediant have you read marley and me??? you just have to go over it with them a couple times and say no and maybe say the command more sterner and stuff you have to halm a calm but  authoritive voice when you're doing the commands and as a pup your dog has a short attention span so only train him for like 15 to 20 min at a time but then train him in the smaller sections more often throughout the day...um ya when he barks is he wagging his tail that's a sign that he wants to play mine barks and starts jumping and i make her sit and go no! and sometimes if he lunges for them he just wants to play...have you tried to actually let the other people pet him ?? they would probably be scared im sure thats how my dog is a little but she just wants to play and people look and me like my dog is going to hurt them or something my dog is just a big sweet moose who loves to play with everyone try bring him to a dog park and socializing him more ( well when the shots are done and stuff) does your dog bark when you feed him because he could just be sassing you and sayin i want my food now|`|3b95UKe3aa	i am not sure if you got you lab from a breed or shelter but if you got him from the breeder hope you checked into their background i raised labs you can email if you have anymore questions.. regardless of where you got him. you need to take him to obedience classes asap and maybe an agility class go to the park tell him in a stern voice no when he starts barking sending you some on-line sites that might be of use.|`|qjyNdFNNaa	Well, it's YOU who should be the alpha. Your dog is simply insecure. Patience, firmness and consistency.<br>  Good luck.|`|AA11113606	Take him to an obedience class so you can learn how to act like the alpha person in the 'dog pack' - I think your dog thinks he is the alpha male, that's why he is barking.  If you show your dog you are the alpha, he will listen to you.
20lFo07jaa	Some do, some don't.  The instinct of all carnivores in the wild is to take advantage of food WHENEVER it is available, full or not.  This is because, obviously, sometimes they must go long periods without food.  In most cats and dogs, this instinct is intact, and with food readily available and suckers for owners, they quickly become dangerously overweight.<br>  <br>  There are exceptions, of course, some dogs and some cats are very thrifty and can manage their own intake.  This is much rarer than the above, but it is not uncommon.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Yes, they feel full like we do, but dogs by instinct are animals of opportunity. In the wild, there are times when food is scarce, so many dogs will tend to overeat in preparing for slim pickings, even though our domestic dogs usually don't have to go without.|`|TRcLJq66aa	WHEN THEY START PUKING EVERYWHERE YOU WILL KNOW THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH.|`|27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	some do...my jack russell does and she won't overeat and she's skinny and my lab will so i have to give her a certain amount ..i know a lab who got into the food supply at a doggy daycamp and wouldn't stop eating and its stomach was like touching the floor so they had to get it pumped|`|5f39GTviaa	yes when there are full they will stop eating if they havnt stopped its cuz they arnt full some dogs eat more then others
kRO55DHyaa	The very first thing to do is work on obedience training.  Teach your dog to obey off leash, how to sit, stay, come, etc.  Teach your dog the commands "hold it" & "drop it" (you'll probably be using these in the field).  Also, play fetch with your dog until you can't play anymore!<br>  <br>  I trained my goldens with pheasant wings (you can buy them at an outdoor store like Sportsman's Warehouse).  Hide them in tall grass and let your dog find them, play a little fetch with them, etc.  Also, try to find a dove scent that you can put on a canvas dummy, and have your dog search for it and retrieve it.<br>  <br>  With many hunting breeds, there isn't a lot of training necessary...it is so innate with them to fetch a bird when it falls.  If your dog isn't interested in finding a downed bird, walk over to the bird with him, and ask him to fetch it, praise him like crazy when he does.  If you know someone with a trained gun dog, invite them along for some training.  Watching the other dog have fun retrieving can help a lot, too.  Make sure that the other dog isn't overly competitive or aggressive, though, there can be some horrible fights between dogs over birds.<br>  <br>  There are many books on training gun dogs, and if you got your dog from a good breeder who hunts their dogs, contact them for more advice. I gave you the "simple version" here, I hope some of this helps.  Good Luck!|`|FNYEkyqLaa	join a dog club that specializes in training hunting dogs.|`|27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	start now the sooner your pup gets it the easier itll be in the future ...take your dog hunting to get used to the sound of the gun ya work on his quickness and his ability to catch things by putting a badmitten birdie on a string or fishing pole and make him chase it and see if he can catch it in midair...my dog learned how to catch birds by herseld but she is a jrt who is naturally bred for hunting but we still used that method before and make her chase other things like a laser pointer ( that could help too) and stuffed animals will help too you could probably tie that to the string/ fishing pole|`|AA11311704	The dog must be old enough to understand basic obedience commands.

p0sLNejraa	es normal que un cachorro haga este tipo de travesuras. mis perritas de cachorros me han roto desde ropa hasta un televisor. Pero bueno, también puede ser que esté un poco estresado. lo que aprendí con mis mascotas es que cuando haga algo que a tí no te parece correcto lo debes corregir en ese momento, no es necesario pegarles, sólo pon la voz fuerte y que se de cuenta que estás enojado. Ayuda también que le des carnazas para perros una o dos veces al día y juguetes para cachorros, así se desestresan y se olvidan poco a poco de las otras cosas que están a su alrededor.|`|AA11502178	si tienes tiempo, sacalo a pasear para que descargue toda la energia que tiene para que no la utilice en hacer travesuras|`|94e78c6112c28ba5c77ba28cc8c82e5eaa	Hola!!!<br>  No tienes que pegarle a tu cachorro para que entienda.<br>  <br>  Entiendo lo de la ropa, da mucho coraje!!! <br>  Te recomiendo que vigiles un poco al perro y le quites la ropa, en lugar de la ropa, pon sus juguetes.<br>  Premíalo con croquetitas cuando este con sus juguetes y cuando intente olfatear tu ropa, en ese momento, en tono determinante dile NO y dale sus juguetes.<br>  Es esencial que el perro tenga opciones, porque de solo tener una, que en este caso es la ropa, pues continuará haciéndolo.<br>   <br>  Esto no es de la noche a la ma?ana, pero con paciencia y amor, lo lograrás,de eso no dudes.<br>  <br>  Mucha suerte|`|LGf6v6ilaa	Nadamas rega?alo - pero fuerte, no es necesario que lo pegas.<br>  <br>  Dile si sigue haciendolo ya no lo vas a querer.<br>  <br>  Pero es un Bebé con 5 meses, cuida tu ropa.

27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	the only real way is to exercise hime more ...it helps him get his play time and calm down may i suggest the laser pointer as a way for exercise its easy and gets my jack russell really tiried|`|DrNvirYPaa	obedience classes should help, or agility......something to keep your dogs mind amused|`|ZGpmROSvaa	Valium (very low dose) like 1/8th or 1/4th of a 5 mg. pill.  But you cannot do that ALL the time.  Just very sternly tell him "NO, NO! LASSIE, I SAID NO!"  Still using a very STERN voice....."LASSIE, CALM DOWN NOW!"<br>  <br>  Speak authoratative, slowly, and definitely serious.<br>  <br>  A "small piece" of any "benzodiazapam" will calm a hyper dog down for about 3 hours.....but it is NOT a cure.....and certainly should not be done repeatedly.  Just use care and patience when training your dog to fit into your "personality"....they will understand eventually.  When you are in a "playful" mood, be sure to let your dog get to exercise his or her ability to be playful also.  <br>  <br>  ONE MORE tip......you can roll up a newspaper....BUT NEVER ACTUALLY HIT YOUR DOG WITH IT!!!!  For some reason, when you roll up newspaper, add a stern tone of voice, and then hit the rolled newspaper into your other hand.....something about that noise really gets a dog's attention.  <br>  <br>  This is all assuming your dog is a puppy.  You know, sometimes you really can't teach an old dog....etc. etc.|`|yHe3oR0Gaa	Try a ball or Frisbee to wear him out.|`|zKU8kBXFaa	uhhhhh just excersise it alot! But since your dog is a dog and not a puppy i guess it has more energey than puppy so it may be hard to calm a hype dog. What kind of breeder is it? If its a german shepherd etc they have tons of energy so it would be hard to burn off those energy! Attending her in sports like agility would be good! Or if you seriously are desperate then try giving "Camomile Tea, a couple of teaspoons or more at night or when you want the dog to start getting ready for bed time. It works on humans, and dogs. My mother used to give it me to help me sleep when I was a kid, and it works. Best of all, its natural, and its cheaper than prescribed drugs.<br>  Get some info on natural remedies for dogs."
AA10990734	You should have your dog seen by a veterinarian.

qxzHVpQhaa	Puppies bite when they play. The best way to stop them is to stop EACH time and tell him no, firmly. At first, you may have to tap him as you say it. ( just enough to get his attention. ) Teaching him his name is easy.  For 3 days Each time you feed him, say his name before you give him the food. If you give a treat, say his name first. On day 4, He will  associate the name with food and come when you call his name,as you progress,  he will know that it is his name.|`|27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	puppied bite and teeth if he is getting too nasty tell him no sternly or hit his nose lightly ...the reason he's not listening is because he doesn't view u as master when u command him to dog something speak in a stern leader voice...unfortunately for u your pup has outsmarted u he is either playing the deaf game where he pretends not too hear u because he doesn't want to listen or he hasn't outsmarted u and just doesn't listen or is ignorant call his name when u come home and when he is being good say good boy-name- and when he does something bad say no-name- ...read marley and me if u are or get frustrated with your pup ..trust me you'll appreciate him more and be able to relate to him at times|`|3d313ca78a16f7fa25e4a8bc3f4e7b41aa	He is teething so give him some ice thats what is did with my dog.

You can use those calls when they get a bit older.|`|AA10782647	teach it NO,,and use treats as rewards|`|FyBncphwaa	Usually he will eventually learn his name, he'll know you're talking to him if you say it enough. And about the biting, my dog is 7 months old and used to do the same thing... just get some toys and when he bites, hit him lightly on the nose and say "no!" then give him his toy... when he starts playing with it give him praise. My dog used to bite to try to get us to play with him, but it really hurt cuz he had those sharp little puppy teeth! If you do this he'll get the idea really soon after you start doing it. I got my dog those toys that you could put bones and stuff inside of, he goes crazy over those<br>  <br>  Also - after reading some of the comments here, you should know that dogs don't "play the deaf game" or "decide" not to listen to you. Dogs can be stubborn, but they also get distracted if they are doing something else. That's what it sounds like to me. Dogs live to please their owner, so if you just spend some time with him then he will learn to trust you more. I like the comment about giving a treat when you say his name... eventually he will come when you say his name. You're just getting to know your little guy right now so give it some time... you'll be best friends in no time. Good luck and I hope I helped!! Dogs bring so much joy to life, I don't know what I would do without my little guy.|`|jt6yMns4aa	Here are some tricks I got at puppy class.<br>  To teach a dog their name, you call him by his name, then give him a treat.  Every time you say his name, he gets a treat.  Very soon he will associate hearing his name with something pleasant.<br>  <br>  When he bites, keep him busy by playing the "name game".  You can teach him lots of other stuff too.<br>  <br>  I strongly suggests that you both enroll in puppy class, you both will benefit from it and learn much more from it.
AA10327148	I am so sorry for your loss. How very sad, and perplexing!<br>  It sure sounds like they found something toxic. It could be squirrel poison, a sprayed orchard, a dead carcass, anti-freeze, garbage, or stagnate water. Stagnant water killed two of my pups, while the others were pretty sick. They just drank from an old pond. Toxic plants are also everywhere, such as most bulb plants. <br>  It could be just any of a number of things, and you won't likely ever figure it out.<br>   I would sure recommend accompanying the other when she is on outings for a while, to make sure she doesn't go back to whatever it was.|`|AA10092569	I hope you mean run in the yard and not loose.  But if they were running loose, it could be anything.  If they were in the yard, maybe someone gave them poison.  It is odd that both of them got sick.  Maybe a poisoned mouse or rat.  It's just hard to say without more info.  I'm so sorry for your loss.  It will take time.|`|74530f1c293522b59e9e263928bd2299aa	I am so sorry, I am a dog lover here, and have been through many things with my dogs as well... but it really does sound like antifreeze poisoning.  What about your neighbors?  Is it possible they are not the friendly sort and did it deliberately?  What about your other dog, is she ok??? No matter what else, do not blame yourself for anything ok?  Accidents can happen, and even if you had taken her to the vet, if it was antifreeze poisoning, still would have had the same outcome.  I truly am sorry for your loss.  But if one of my dogs up and died, I certainly would see if any of my neighbors hated dogs.  Were they fenced in? Did they have free roam?? I stil am curious about her sister...|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	It could have been rodent poison put out by a neighbor, or carried in an actual rodent - although I would suspect it was the former since both dogs got some of it.<br>  <br>   There apparently was something that destroyed her liver, which does not regenerate, and it could have been antifreeze, or some other poison.   Look arund anywhere they had access to - and ask the neighbors if they had recently had the pest control guys out.<br>  <br>    My sympathies - but please take your dogs to the vet at the first sign of troubole, as this is the only time your vet has a chance of helping them.|`|MQ83HGD5aa	Awww, poor thing. May have been something you didn't know that was in your backyard that they got into or possibly even Anti-Freeze.

Dogs love the sweet taste of anti-freeze.  It would only take a couple spoonfuls to kill a healthy Rott.  Check your yard for plants/trees/shrubs which could be poisonous.  The ASPCA has a good list of toxic household items you can check.  So very sorry for your loss.|`|2987c76898d620d12399b4360fe69474aa	I'm so sorry for your loss....this is pretty impossible to tell why this happened, with out blood work or a post Morten...so many things could of been the cause and prob would take a long time to reach an answer.<br>  poison could of been possible if all her organs were shutting down but as you said if no poisons are around you just couldn't tell. there is one poison that def could cause a complete organ shut down and that's antifreeze....was this around???? <br>  sooooo sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  qualified veterinary nurse UK|`|3e3dfe2723cd01184ea5fa6bd0781a53aa	maybe she got bit by a bug and didn't realise it and it caused a big malfunction...???|`|6Av2ZdR6aa	There are many foods the dogs could have ate that are posionous like:- Alcoholic beverages<br>  - Avocado<br>  - Chocolate (all forms)<br>  - Coffee (all forms)<br>  - Fatty foods<br>  - Macadamia nuts<br>  - Moldy or spoiled foods<br>  - Onions, onion powder<br>  - Raisins and grapes<br>  - Salt<br>  - Yeast dough<br>  - Garlic<br>  - Products sweetened with xylitol <br>  -arsenic<br>  -zinc<br>  -lead<br>  <br>  <br>  Anti-freeze would have produced vomitting within 30 minutes of ingestion.

ld2vmypNaa	I have had 2 sliders for 36 yrs now plus a 7 yr old and a 5 yr old. This is how I have taken care of them for 36 yrs. Great pets.<br>  I have had them in a stand alone 150gal pond from sears..for about 6 yrs now..<br>  <br>  Here is some important and a lot of info. If he or she is small get feeder guppies or small feeder goldfish, frozen brown worms ..or live brown worms from a fish store. petco and or petsmart do not carry live worms.. <br>  <br>  Red-eared sliders, Gender especially juveniles, can be difficult to sex. Gender in adults is determined by external physical characteristics and behavior. In Comparison to females, males have longer fore claws (which are use in courtship), a longer tail length, a longer distance from the body to the vent opening, a tail that is thicker at the base and generally a smaller body size and shell length. Turtles are considered juveniles till after 5 yrs old.<br>  Their Home<br>  The minimum enclosure size for hatchling re-eared slider should be a 20-gallon aquarium minimum. As a general rule, the water depth should be at least 2 times the turtle's length, with several extra inches of air space between the surface of the water to the top edge of the tank to prevent escapes. So if your turtle is 4” around  he needs at least 10 to 12” of water to swim. For ONE 4 to 5 inch long sliders, the recommended minimum enclosure surface area is 50 gal plus tank with an extra square foot for each additional turtle.<br>  What to Feed<br>  In the wild, re-eared sliders eat both animal and plant sources of food. However, juveniles are mainly meat eaters but still love the greens. <br>  In captivity, the diet for juveniles should consist  of a commercial aquatic turtle pellet and small feeders guppies or goldfish. Hatchlings and juveniles should be fed on a daily basis; however, they should be offered no more than they will consume during a single session to minimize water contamination. The diet can be supplemented with live fish of an appropriate size (guppies, goldfish), tubiflex worms and earthworms. Plant matter, in the form of chapped leafy greens or finely chapped mixed vegetables, can be offered once weekly but may not be readily accepted until they grow older.<br>   Fill tank with approx 20 feeder guppies and or 10 to 15 small goldfish. you’ll know when to replenish the live food supply. just count what’s left and then fill it up again..Get a cuttle bone from the bird dept and drop in the water for added calcium. Hopefully they may eat it and that’s what you want.<br>  For adults, 20% of the diet may consist of some commercial turtle pellets. Plus 80% of their diet is fresh alive fish to catch in their water which also gives them exercise when trying to catch to eat. Adults should be fed greens kale, romaine, red leaf lettuce, mustard greens, dandelion, watercress, parsley. Swiss chard, shredded carrots, shredded squash, thawed frozen mixed vegetables and miscellaneous fruits. Adults can be fed every two to three days. NO iceberg or cabbage!!<br>  Vital Statistics<br>  Total Body length: 5-8" average, up to 12 inches max.<br>  Life span: 15-25+ years<br>  Males have the longer foreclaws..<br>  <br>  Water quality and Filtration <br>  Sliders are voracious feeders and tend to foul the water quickly with their messy eating habits and frequent defecation. Therefore, a system needs to be in place for good water quality. Partial to full water changes can be performed. Many different filter systems are available ..<br>  <br>  Common Health Problems<br>  If you take proper care of your red-eared slider by providing excellent housing, nutrition, lighting, and heating, it is unlikely to ever become ill or injured. However, it’s still important to familiarize yourself with ailments common to sliders so that you can quickly identify them in your own slider, should it become ill. The following are some of the most common medical problems among red-eared sliders. <br>  <br>  Fungal Infections<br>  “Fungal infections are fairly common among red-eared sliders, especially younger ones. If you notice what looks like a light layer of cotton on your slider’s shell or eyes or in its mouth, this is most likely some form of fungal infection. Although their appearance can be alarming, most infections in their early stages are fully treatable at home. If a fungal infection remains untreated, however, it can spread across the entire body and cause serious harm to your turtle.<br>  To treat a mild fungal infection, immerse your red-eared slider in a warm saltwater bath for about half an hour each day, using a soft sponge to gently scrub the infected regions. You can also treat patches of fungus with topical applications of a mild antiseptic, such as povidone-iodine. As long as the problem isn’t severe, you should notice signs of recovery within a day or two, and a full recovery in about 10–14 days.<br>  If your turtle has a persistent fungal infection that home treatment isn’t curing, take it to the vet for treatment. Several medications are available that can address a fungal infection if it hasn’t spread too far.” <br>  Shell Rot. First make a dry box to keep the turtle in, shell rot needs water to grow. <br>  Keep it warm and give it plenty of light.<br>  Scrub the shell gently with a toothbrush and water.<br>  Let the turtle swim for about 20 minutes a day in something other than his pond..clean water. <br>  1-2 times a day take a cotton ball apply Hydrogen Peroxide to it then to his shell. It'll start bubbling which means its cleaning it. it. DO NOT get it in his eyes. <br>  Then clean the shell and apply providone-iodine solution to the shell, coat the shell and don't clean it off until he is ready to swim the next day.<br>  ** Keep this up for several weeks and it should go away. . MOST important !!! TOSS in a bird cuttle bone in the water for calcium. it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it that’s fine!!<br>  <br>  Respiratory Infections<br>  “Slider turtles and other aquatic species are susceptible to respiratory infections. Most respiratory infections that can affect sliders are mild and easily treatable in their early stages, but there are also some particularly virulent infections that can kill a turtle very quickly without veterinary attention. Sliders usually develop respiratory infections when their tank is too cold. <br>  Symptoms of an infection include a runny nose, wheezing, lopsided swimming (an ailing lung changes the turtle’s buoyancy), lethargy, and a refusal to eat. If you identify the illness in its early stages, you may be able to treat it by removing the sick slider from its quarters into a new, clean tank (especially if you keep multiple sliders, since the majority of respiratory infections are contagious) and keeping it a few degrees warmer than normal. Warmth is the most crucial factor in treating respiratory infections in the home. If the condition persists for more than a few days or worsens, bring your slider to your veterinarian, who will treat the infection with antibiotics.”<br>  Contact the “herpetologicalsocieties.com“.|`|4360cf3c4091cff956ff8bf91dd7789faa	Assuming you're reffering to a Red Eared Slider, then their diet changes with age. Young sliders will generally start out eating more animal matter and meat, and as they mature they will start to eat more vegetation.<br>  In captivity, its not always possible or practical to feed an all-natural diet. Most people will also add specially formulated turtle pellets (there are different formulas for aquatic turtles and land tortoises) to the turtle's diet. <br>  For a young turtle, crickets; chopped (yes, chopped) worms; mosquito larve, dried shrimp, and turtle pellets provide a good meal. Then you should start to add veggies like carrots, celery, and maybe aquatic plants (they were supposed to be decoration in my turtle's tank, but she ended up eating them).|`|1ilUyHG7aa	as stated, hatchlings should be fed a high quality turtle pellet (such as mazauri, rep-cal or reptomin) daily as much as can fit in the turtle's head if it was hollow. also you could put some rosy red minnows to provide food and excercise. <br>  <br>  when the turtle has reached the 4 inch mark you need to start feeding veggies. collard greens, kale, mustard greens, dark leafy lettuce, squash and carrots are good staples. turtles also enjoy tomatoes and blueberries. those should be fed sparingly due to suagr content and the the acidity in the tomatoes.<br>  <br>  also feed cuttlebone (found in the bird section of petstores) with the hard backing cut off. this offers a ton of calcium to help keep healthy shells.<br>  <br>  foods to avoid:<br>  stay away from mealworms and goldfish. they are too fatty and provide very little nutritional value.<br>  stay away from spinach. it blocks the turtle's body from absorbing calcium.<br>  <br>  tip: if your turtle doesnt want to eat his veggies you can try the tough love approach and just feed veggies until he eats or you can try soaking the turtle's veggies in tuna water from canned tuna.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|3bbe083d3f1d37a48b406dfa49604426aa	Commerical turtle food, shrimps and prawns (if you're having some yourself for dinner, you can give a small bit to the turtle), smoked salmon (again if you're having it yourself), fresh raw fish, live feeder fish from the pet shop
LqimEAfWaa	There is absolutely no need to keep a light on in the room where the litter box is kept.  All that will do is increase your electric bill.<br>  <br>  Cats actually prefer it to be darker.  Their eyes are made for night time hunting.<br>  <br>  If you really feel that there needs to be a light in the room for your cat, then just get a cheap night light and put it in there.  It will provide more than enough light.  Most cats can find it through smell.  Same with their food bowl.<br>  <br>  When I had cats, the only reason we had a night light in the room with the litter box, food, and water is because we kept it in the bathroom.  The night light was to help us find the way there in the middle of the night, not the cats.|`|woRykYYVaa	Nope. But I keep a night light in the room for them because their food and water are also in there.|`|129movX6aa	No... I hear cats can see in the dark. Plus my cats make it to their litter box just fine.|`|ynEdpoj8aa	No, they can see much better than us in the dark.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	Use a low light night light.|`|9LIFiwltaa	No, cats have no problem seeing in the dark.  |`|YJRCC0vbaa	No. Cats can see just fine in the dark. 
c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	Is your cat a male? If so, he could be spraying the corners to mark his territory. Neutering the cat usually fixes this, but not always. You can buy a product called Feliway at the pet store. It is a pheremone that smells like the scent cats make when they rub their faces on things. Cats will not spray mark areas where there is the face pheremone scent. <br>  <br>  If it is just regular peeing, you need to get rid of the pee smell. Even if you can't smell it anymore, remember that a cat's nose is much more sensitive than ours, and they can smell things we cant. A cat will keep peeing where it smells a cat or even a dog has peed before. <br>  <br>  To clean cat pee spots and accidents on the floor, or any other area, thoroughly soak the area in plain white vinegar. If possible (such as on the floor) blot up the wet area with paper towels and newspaper then put something heavy on top of the papers (such as heavy books - just be sure to wrap them in plastic bag to protect them from the wetness) and leave them on the vinegar spot till its dry. The acid pH of the vinegar will cancel out the alkaline pH of the urine, thus eliminating the smell, and should prevent kitty from peeing there ever again. This really works, I've used it for years. Vinegar is really cheap and easy to find at most stores.<br>  <br>  It could be that your cat does not like his litter or litter box. You might try switching brands of litter to a different type, or get him a second litter box and put it in a different room. Cats are very clean animals and like to have their litter box cleaned every day. If it gets too dirty they will stop using it. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps =^.^=|`|MHWT13WYaa	put down tinfoil, orange peels, also get a cleaner that has enzymes that will take out the smell, a lot of why they keep going back is the smell. take away the smell, the cat wont be as tempted to pee there. also you can get a stress relieving oils that seem to help at times. good luck|`|wWEe8FTTaa	Put the litter box in the corner.<br>  done.|`|xNOloeJgaa	Move into a "round" house!!!|`|bnWc2Vkqaa	Have you gotten it fixed?|`|ff1Tgp3taa	Number 1, get something like "urine gone" to remove the smell, to prevent the cat from returning to that spot to spray, or urinate.  Second never yell at your cat.  Keep a water bottle with a sprayer, and squirt the cat with water, (never in the face) when you catch the cat in the act.  Also make sure your cat is well, because sometimes when cats have urinary tract problems they urinate, or spray just everywhere.  Also use a time out when the cat urinates in places other than the litter box, hopefully in an area where the litter box is located.<br>  <br>  Also make sure your cat's litter box is clean, because if the litter box is not clean, the cat will not use it.|`|Ir4hXVisaa	take some time out of every day, be paitent and litter box train her|`|83oDxEepaa	if it's a male it could be spraying to mark its territory. If he is not neutered, there is a big chance of him spraying. There is still a small chance that he could continue to spray after being neutered, but this is kinda uncommon.
eKyPgEBXaa	In my opinion you definitely need to keep your cat indoors on Halloween.  I assume you would have many little children & visitors at your door.  Many cats & even kittens would just love to scoot outside during that evening.<br>  Just give kitty an alternate "home" or place to romp indoors for that evening!  Good luck to you....|`|ff1Tgp3taa	All domestic cats should be kept indoors.  Why?  For their safety, number one, and number two for the safety of wildlife in general.  Wildlife such as birds, rabbits, squirrels, just to name a few.  Cats by nature are hunter/killers, and they take a huge toll on wildlife.  <br>  <br>  So indeed if you are an animal lover keep your cat indoors, I do, for the good of nature.|`|Rdw8RyFraa	keep your pets inside...kids on the streets full of sugar and older kids out with friends trying to show off--this is the perfect night that they might do something stupid. <br>  <br>   I remember running wild around my city on halloween--we never hurt animals, but did some dumb things that we would have never done normally.<br>  <br>  keep your animals safe, keep them inside with so many on the streets at night|`|wGrRvFePaa	I would just to be safe.

Do cats only get hit by cars, poisoned, eaten by wild animals, dismembered by loose dogs or catch diseases on Halloween?  You talk about your cat like it's human.  It's your PET.  And as its owner it's your RESPONSIBILITY to keep him safe.  So keep him inside for Halloween - as well as every other day of the year.  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=indoorsoroutdoors" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a>|`|CyZn5PLcaa	yes he will be scared and probaly will get killed or stolen or anything could happen,but he's a cat that move fast so he knows how to run and hide cause thats what their gud at.he will most likely want to stay in anyway.most cats do on halloween.if he does want to go out well...i dont know im not a cat expert.=| .he will be ok;]|`|1862988caa31895743dd3abb95f8b3d0aa	yes you should keep it inside on devils night and halloween. there are a lot of sick people in this world and if something happened u would never forgive yourself. id rather upset my kitty and keep them inside for 2 nights and have it safe!|`|hnrgUrOwaa	Its probably a good idea but only because a lot of people are out on halloween and some people are cruel to animals.|`|c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	This is good advice if you have a cat that is all black or all white. If you suspect that there are bad people in your neighborhood that might steal your cat, despite whatever color he is, you would be very wise to keep him in. I have lost several cats too soon because of dangers outside and I no longer allow my cats to go out at all. There are too many dangers that they face outside, such as cars, dogs, wild animals, poison, bad people, being lost, stolen, disease, etc. They do not miss out on any important life experience by being kept indoors. 
2b8c8c5b76146eb48b6b5ff068369797aa	Use a kitten bottle, cut a hole in the top with small scissors.  If the hole is too small, the kitten will not realize that there is formula in the bottle.  I would make a pretty big hole in the nipple.  I had to raise small kittens over the summer and that is how I did it.  Best wishes to you!!  If the kitten still will not drink, you should take it to a vet.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	The first 8 weeks of a kitten's life should be with it's mother if at all possible.  If not consult your local Vet, about alternatives.|`|HYuSdRynaa	Try getting a little toy feeding bottle and feed him milk with it.  Maybe he still can't drink on his own yet...|`|DD1oxtxyaa	you are talking about the kmr right?|`|c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	Is he old enough to eat on his own? If he is, then maybe he is not hungry. If he normally eats and has suddenly stopped, he may be sick, in which case you need to take him to the vet for some help. Is your kitty too small to eat on his own, like an orphaned kitten? If so, there are several things you can do to try to get him to eat. First of all DONT use an eyedropper. You can accidentally get milk into his lungs, which can kill him. You should be using milk made just for kittens, called KMR, which can be found at pet stores. Cow's milk is bad for cats. There are two types of nipples - long and short. If your kitten wont suck on one, try the other kind. He could be just fussy. You can also try rubbing him on the forehead or the back, the way mommy cat would if she was grooming him. Mom cats groom the babies to get them to eat. You can also try putting some Karo syrup on his lips to stimulate his hunger. If all of this does not work, your kitten could be sick and should see a vet as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Below I have linked a good page on how to care for abandoned kittens, you may find some more useful help there. The stuff I talked about above is from this page.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps =^.^=<br>  
AA11736483	Your cat probably likes it because of the tasty dairy products in it, but ranch dressing typically has onion and garlic in it - a no no for cats. Too much can cause destruction of red blood cells (anemia).|`|ynEdpoj8aa	It may upset his stomach or cause diarhea, nothing serious though.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	Keep the Kitten out of the Ranch Dressing from now on, this garbage is not good for us too much fat and addatives like MSG etc.  Try buyin a mix of wet and dry Wellness brand Cat Food.
0Hgz4sNxaa	Older cats tend to eat more.  Try not to feed her as much and leave the food there until she eats it, if you leave the canned food more that 2 days it can become rotten and the cat wouldn't eat it anyway.  Its ok for a cat to eat alot as long as they don't get sick.<br>  Hope this helps<br>  Maddy=]|`|AA10859773	No, cats are individuals just like people.<br>  <br>  It's impossible for me to say why you have an overeater.  It could be emotional or it could be physical.<br>  <br>  It wouldn't hurt to have her checked by a vet.  I rather doubt it's hyperthyroid, as I *believe* those cats have voracious appetites but they tend to lose weight.  Or maybe that's worms.  Whatever, just have her checked.<br>  <br>  One possibility is that the food you're feeding isn't satisfying.  If you feed a better quality food - such as Evo - that is more species appropriate, you may find that it better satisfies her appetite.<br>  <br>  But in the end, you need to lay down the law.  Determine how much she should be eating and keep her to that.  Don't give in.  If you do it once she will always expect it and you'll get no peace.<br>  <br>  Ok, one other suggestion - canned foods are less calorie dense than dry foods, so cats can eat more of it.  If you switch her to canned you'll be able to feed more and that may do the trick for her.|`|c9387f79b14133134f45bd7ea7546614aa	Have you had your fat cat's thyroid checked?|`|GW7bLQpGaa	Just because your cat asks for food doesn't mean you should give it to her. Ration her food and keep her away from the younger one so she doesn't go pick on your other cat for her food. When meal time is over and the younger hasn't finished her food take it away so the older one can't get at it. If she's to fat also stop giving her treats. She'll start losing weight if you are on top of the food situation. How much food do you give her? Make sure you follow the instructions of the bag. If you give more then the recommended amount then go down to what the bag says. If not then go lower if you want her to lose weight. I feed my cat a hand full of dry in the morning and 1 baggy of whiskas wet food and she does fine on that (she's also over weight that is why she get less and she is slowly losing the weight and she is not starving) Also, every cat is different just like people.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	Stop giving in, feed the cat twice a day once every 12 hours, say 6 am, and 6pm.

As long as they're not wheezing or their breathing's laboured it should be easy to treat and your chickens should be fine within the next few days. Add some Avipro or a product called Respite (garlic formula) to their drink each day. <br>  <br>  Citricidal (grapefruit extract) is another great product to help chickens through a cold. You can add this to their drink too (only use one not all of the products I mentioned above) and can be bought online or from health food shops. You only need to add a few drops to about 200ml of water.<br>  <br>  Also check to make sure the bedding you're using is dust-free and also if you're using hay I'd consider using a different material.

If they were, did you receive a copy of his litter papers so he could be registered???<br>  <br>  You can verify his breed by doing DNA testing. <br>  <br>  I don't think you look like an idiot.  I'm not sure what the trigger was for your concern, but you can also discuss the dog with your vet.  You should go to the DNA websites and read up on their testing.  It's easy to do.  You just have to figure out if it's worth the cost to you to do the testing.  Good Luck ! -!-|`|AA12128656	if his parents are AKC registered, then there's no reason why you shouldn't have the AKC do a DNA test. it's fairly simple.<br>  <br>  why would YOU get money back, YOU didn't pay for him, you said you got him for xmas! and i'm sure that the breeder would tell you to pound sand, because if he IS a MUTT, then he came from a BYB!|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Registration papers are only as reliable as the breeder then can be falsified even with reputable kennel clubs like the AKC.   Responsible breeder don't sell puppies as gifts as your puppies breeder did so that is a red flag right there.   It is entirely possible that your puppy is just a poorly bred purebred poodle.  Unfortunately many BYB produce such poor quality dogs that they don't look anything like the breed is suppose to look.  If you truly suspect the dog is mixed breed and he was sold with AKC registration papers (not just told he was from AKC registered parents but that he himself is registrable)  then you can file a report with the AKC and they may investigate the breeder.|`|fd9e086ddef9e2aa9264bc37a01ae4d8aa	dose it matter? who cares if he/she is a poodle, just as long as you love he/she! :3<br>  but there are blood test that you can do, try going to petco or a vet and seeing if they can do it|`|Qe04KxYoaa	Most likely what you have is a poor quality purebred dog. Check out the AKC site and find out about the breeder. They probably will not give you money back just take the dog back.|`|AA10400143	AKC can do DNA testing and it is farly cheap.

Papers can be forged, although i do not believe it is very common with dogs. If you got him from a respectable breeder then there should be no concerns, however if you got him from a "backyard breeder" or a puppy store, there is more of a chance of having a small part of another dogs genes in your dog. <br>  There is a decent amount that needs to be done in order to get proper papers for any breed of dog, so chances are they are real.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	If the thing was purchased from a reputable breeder & has AKC reg.,it's real...it's just pisspoor/LOW/pet-quality! <br>  <br>  That's how one can tell QUALITY from crap...QUALITY is visible!

If he was a gift, you wouldn't be able to get anything, because you didn't pay for the dog, only the person who purchased the dog would be able to do that, and they would have to prove the fraud was done knowingly. (hate people who try to get something for nothing, if you love the dog what does it matter, unless you just want to know for yourself)
IFEIP5Doaa	Well hopefully you are no asking about keeping them both together!<br>  <br>  Piranha are schools, so keep them in groups. But they are also a big fish, to keep them happy and not sit there and attack one another you will need a large tank and keep them well fed. And by well fed I do not mean a bunch of fish, remember you have a south american fish, feeders are asian, not even the species they would prey upon in the wild, and they are high in fat. They do much better on a frozen fish food diet like beef heart and blood worms, offering fish as more of a weekly treat. Also by offering less fish they are less likely to get hurt while going for food.<br>  <br>  As for the pins, I lvoe these guys, but there is a trick to them. They are brackish water by nature, they can go fresh water, but it has to be a slower introduction. Also if you keep them in fresh water, they are more prone to disease, so if you go with fresh water, you will need to keep up on weekly water changes even if you have a filter on the tank. But that doesnt mean keep them in brackish water and let their water get dirty, they will require a water change often still if kept that way. <br>  Here is a link to a great website on pins, I would suggest reading it over and doing alot of research on them, if kept right they are easy to care for, but they are the type of animal that does require some research befor buying to be ready for their care.<br>  <a href="http://www.neoterrapin.com/home/" rel="nofollow">http://www.neoterrapin.com/home/</a>|`|qJquEEdmaa	use social darwinism. put them in the same tank. let them fight to the death!!!!!

B6zl0AJDaa	Impressive bloodline tends to have HYPP {Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis}. Impressive was a quarter horse sire that passed on the fatal HYPP gene to some of his foals. He was a champion halter horse but he should not have been bred. This caused the deaths of many young and good horses. Get your horse tested. If he is N/N, he doesn't have the gene. If he is H/N he is a carrier..This might only be possible in females though. Carriers do not express the symptoms but they should not be bred. If he is H/H..see if you can do anything to prevent this disease.<a href="http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/hypp..." rel="nofollow">http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/hypp...</a><br>  <br>  is a great website with tons of info on this genetic disorder!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperkalemi..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperkalemi...</a><br>  <br>  Here's what Bill Brewer, AQHA President had to say about it.<a href="http://www.aqha.com/association/registra..." rel="nofollow">http://www.aqha.com/association/registra...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  HYPP, also called 'Impressive Syndrome' is a genetic disorder which causes episodes of muscle tremors (shaking or trembling, weaknesses and/or collapse).<br>  <br>  It came from the famous American Quarter Horse stallion Impressive, which many mares were breed to because he was believed to be the perfect AQHA horse. no one was aware aware he carried HYPP until years later..<br>  <br>  <br>  H/H, meaning they have the mutation and it is homozygous. These horses always pass on the disease.<br>  N/H, meaning they have the mutation and it is heterozygous. These horses are affected to a lesser degree, and pass on the disease 50% of the time.<br>  N/N, meaning they do not have the mutation and cannot pass it on, even if they are descendants of Impressive.<br>  <br>  I currently own 3 mares who are Impressive bred but all 3 are N/N.<br>  <br>  If I remember correctly AQHA is NOT accepting foals by AQHA stallions or out of AQHA mares who are H/H nowadays...|`|1WkO82e2aa	I don't know where or who this stallion is but I can only hope it is a mis-print. H/H means he is double positive instead of double negative. The resulting offspring will at least be N/H of not H/H. The BEST you can hope for is non-symptomatic. The is absolutely no way the horse should be bred. This is the type of irresponsible breeding that has the AQHA planning to refuse to register these horses.|`|034f5753f9ad6567e841eda4b3bd8210aa	H/H means he will throw HYPP to every foal.  He has two copies of the defective gene and will always transmit it.  I know people who won't buy a halter prospect unless it has HYPP.  I personally can't stand it, but I know how to manage it after 5 years of working for a halter horse breeder.<br>  <br>  This is  agood article from UC Davis that explains it a bit better.<br>  <a href="http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/hypp.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/hypp...</a>|`|8d25j8CYaa	The H/H that the horse is a double positive for the HYPP genetic disorder and will pass the gene on to 100% of its offspring.

Possible results of HYPP testing are N/N, N/H and H/H.<br>  HYPP is inherited as a dominant trait, which means a heterozygous (N/H) stallion or mare bred to a normal (N/N) horse will result in approximately half of the offspring being affected and half being normal. The rare homozygote (H/H) usually is severely affected with the disease and will pass the gene to its offspring 100 percent of the time. <br>  *!* ? Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) is an inherited disease that leads to uncontrolled muscle twitching or profound muscle weakness, and in severe cases, may lead to collapse and/or death.<br>  <br>  ?

hetZz4c1aa	Many have bought that book and others like it.  Whatever the book the results are all the same.  Some cats can be "trained" to sometimes use the toilet for a short time.  But this is not natural for the cat, so he decides to find an area of your home that is more natural for him.  Now you have a cat who is peeing and pooing on your bed, sofa, etc.........all of it not good and a hard habit to break.<br>  <br>  So, my thoughts are forget the book and go with a litter box.  You and your cat will be happier.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Rw7gi86Naa	I would never do that to my cats. Cats have been doing the same thing for hundreds of years: digging and squatting. It is instinct to them--this is why many cats do not need to be litter trained at all. <br>  <br>  If you were to force your cat to make such a drastic change, it would be like someone telling you that you can never use a toilet again. Instead you have to use a litter box. That sounds ridiculous and unreasonable, right? Well your cat would certainly feel the same way about sitting on the toilet.<br>  <br>  Some people are successful in training their cat to use a toilet, but I think that it is very unnatural and even cruel. Doing so often leads to elimination problems. It may sound nice to not have to clean a litter box anymore, but how do you feel about cleaning cat pee off your toilet every day, and cleaning up other "presents" in your house?|`|FC34jxiaaa	You're already using wood pellets?

''<br>  <br>  It's valid.  Some owners choose to euthanize a pet due to concerns of the difficulty of finding good homes.  It's very valid.  Shelters are full, SPCA, Humane Society and all the rest in my area euthanize all the time. Each animal has so many days to be adopted and then it's gone to make room for more to give more a chance of adoption.<br>  <br>  So it is a valid option for a pet owner to have their pet euthanized when they cannot have the pet anymore?  Yes.  It should be the last option but it's neither right nor wrong.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	If there is no medically valid reason to euthanize, then every other option should be taken to rehome a pet.<br>  <br>  Humans that think their pet will not be happy with anyone else are simply delusional and selfish. <br>  <br>  There are too many hard working rescue groups in the world today to validate such an outdated idea.|`|AA12126470	Many humans want so badly to believe that their pet is so bonded with them that the pet would never get over being placed in rescue.<br>  Most time that is just not true. <br>  I have worked with rescues for many years. Both cats and dogs.<br>  While some cats do awful in shelter settings when they are put into a foster home they do fine. Many times our rescue gets calls about cats that they are going to put down because they are not adoptable. Most times when we pick them up they are scared and aggressive and hiss and spit. But once in a foster home setting most come around really quickly.<br>  Dogs are even more adaptable than cats. <br>  I have had foster dogs from pups up to age 10. I have run into very few who can not make the transition into a new home. <br>  Dogs live in the moment and accept things as they are. They can not change them so they just make the best of the situation and go on.<br>  If the pet is truely facing abuse then it would be better to euthanize but most are not facing abuse when placed into a rescue. <br>  Yes their rules and lives may and do change but most adapt fine and go on to live wonderful lives. <br>  I have had three rescues who have been some of the best dogs ever and they all had great lives even though their previous owners thought they could not cope.|`|p7swtBYzaa	This moral dilemma is no dilemma at all, it is a cop out, an egotistical rationale used by some really self centered people to get rid of a companion animal quickly and without fuss.<br>  <br>  If you must get rid of your dog or cat (and this is usually something that can be worked out - usually it is a matter of the poor animal having become inconvenient or too much trouble), there is no reason to euthanize.<br>  The options are not euthanasia or suffering in a bad home --- you take the time and make the effort to find a good home, or you spend a little money and put the animal in a posiition (say a donation to a shelter or a breed rescue if the dog is a particular breed) where the animal will have the assurance of being sheltered decently and lovingly until a good Forever Home can be found.<br>  Our rescue has kept dogs in foster (same home, good life, loving people) for several years until a proper home was found for the dog - it just about NEVER comes down to die or be miserable for a healthy animal - it just doesn't.   May take time, lots of work, but it can be done.<br>  We are a rescue, we do it - and it isn't even for our dogs, it is for dogs that have usually been dumped by people who use this absurd, viciously cruel and just plain fake excuse of "the animal will never be happy without me".<br>  I doubt it, dogs transfer trust and love very well, and I doubt anybody who can think up this kind of choice really loved that animal all that much, it's more about ego and laziness than any "moral dilemma".|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	I personally think its wrong, i think the cat or dog should have a fare chance at life in a good home, there for it is the owners responsibility to find a fit home for the unwanted animal.<br>   The only reason a dog or cat should be euthanized is if it is sick and dieing from a disease that can not be fixed, or if the dog or cat is a danger to society.|`|s6YmD7vaaa	I second Walking Lady's statement 100%.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	about 20 yrs ago i rescued an adult abused retriever mix. Timber hated men and small children. and i knew he could never be SAFELY adopted out to anyone. if there ever came a time i couldn't keep him, i'd have to put him down. and it was in my will that he should be euthanized if i died. he was with me for 15 yrs.<br>  i believe there's a law in effect that says pets have to have a well dog/cat check before euthanasia to determine if it's necessary. but i don't think it makes sense. if the vet refuses, the owners will just dump, drown or shoot the dog anyway.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Yes and no ...<br>  <br>  I think once the quality of life for a dog is in question, it's better to euthanize.  This would include dogs that have temperament issues which would cause them to have to live secluded lives.  Dogs that are very sick.  Dogs that would have to live without proper nutrition and social opportunities with both other dogs and humans.  If those things can't be provided for a dog, yes, it's better to put them down.<br>  <br>  However, I feel the argument given by the girl that she thought the dog was too attached to her and her family blahblahblah.  That's putting way too many human emotions onto your dog.  Our dogs do love us, but dogs will adapt and bond with who ever if feeding them and spending time with them.  I think we'd all like to think our dog couldn't love anyone else, but that our insecure ego's at work there and that sort of attitude does not benefit your dog .. not even one tiny bit.  In fact, I find it to be a very selfish attitude and ... well, it could be a lethal attitude for some dogs.|`|JBPsePnwaa	There is a no-kill shelter in the area where I live.  I went there once to look at the cats/kittens they had for adoption.  These animals (about 150) were living in small cages.I think my daughters hamster has a bigger cage.  Some were in a converted barn.  These had gone feral.  I don't believe this is a life for any animal.  (the dog conditions weren't much better) Since then I have viewed non-medical euthanasia differently.  I work for a vet, and have done many for different reasons.  If my life was to be lived the way theirs was, I would opt to be euthanized instead of caged when no crime was committed|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Why put a healthy animal to sleep,i have fostered dogs who have become attached to me and follow me about, but to put them to sleep no way! they have been re homed, and i admit i did worry how they would cope after being so attached to me,but i needn't have, as they are now very happy and well adjusted dogs living life to the full! they don't think like us humans, and do not mope and dwell, they live for the moment|`|asEeCmzraa	I can see where both viewpoints come from. I understand that people humanise their animals to a point where they cannot see them being happy anywhere else. I understand that people don't want their animals to suffer in their new home, that they don't want their dog to live in a cage for life. <br>  Having said that- I am against euthanising a perfectly balanced, healthy pet. I wouldn't ever do it. If I had a dog that was perfectly well behaved, loved people, loved other animals, and was a fantastic pet, there is no way I would euthanise. I would either find him or her a new owner myself, and if that failed, then I would turn the dog over to a shelter. <br>  <br>  I don't, however, agree with the idea of a no-kill shelter. I think that there is a point when you can't keep an animal anymore, especially not in a cage. It isn't good for them. Imagine being given up by your owner, put into a cage at, say, six months old, and living your life that way? You don't have attention from one family forever, you have others who need it just as much. I think that a dog shouldn't spend any more than a year, maybe two, living in a shelter. <br>  <br>  I own two dogs that could never be rehomed, though. One is a nasty piece of work who has food aggression problems and loathes men and the other hates other dogs and anything noisy. My dogs suck, and I wouldn't trade them for the world. I would hate to find out that I could no longer keep them, because we have limited options.|`|v53LgfsWaa	If there is something medically wrong with the animal I see no issue with letting them suffer so I would do it in a heart beat.  But to do it to an animal just because they are no longer wanted by you is morally wrong and unacceptable.  Someone else might love to have your pet.  I would consider giving it away before I did that.|`|FoeyqAZqaa	I would rather euthanize my pet then have it suffer.|`|KuUx34hCaa	you have tackled one of the most controversial ? to date I have to say yes as I would not want my dogs suffer good luck|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	*The main question to be addressed in my essay is: "Is the mindset that it is better to euthanize an animal rather than possibly subjecting it to an unhappy or abused life a valid one?"<br>  I believe that instead of criticizing or writing an essay on the shelters and vet clinics that euthanize do to overpopulation we should take a look at puppy mills, back yard breeders, stray populations.<br>  They are the ones that are to blame and we need to have better laws to control breeding... It's really getting out of hand.<br>  Shelters and rescue groups have more animals than they know what to do with, yet there are people out there still buying puppies and kittens. <br>  As a society I think we need to better educate the public that shelter/rescue dogs are just as loving, are not all ill behaved, nor come with problems. I also think that shelters have a stigma they have to work against. Not everyone shares the same thoughts on abandoned dogs-they feel the dog did something or wasn't good enough rather than taking a look at the person or the situation.<br>  *Did you know that for every one baby that's born there are seven puppies born... That's more dogs than people and simply there are not enough homes for all of them. For rescue groups, foster families, and shelters (And taxpayers) a lot of money is spent/needed to take care of animals properly. Food, vet care, pet supplies, having staff, and etc. It's a lot of responsibility as well.<br>  Then the people who do get dogs or cats from shelters don't always supply them the best care either. But that being said, I don't feel that people should not send their dogs to a shelter(provided they cannot take care of it) because they are selfish and feel the dog wouldn't be okay- dogs are pack animals. Even though switching families is very stressful on the animal, they adapt just like in the wild.<br>  I absolutely support euthanasia when it comes to population control. It's sad indeed-but what is worse is the dog or cat living their whole lives cooped up in a crate/cage and never really experiencing life as an animal should.|`|EnwYxbS4aa	I absolutely agree with cindy.  I would far rather go to sleep peacefully than spend my days in the equivalent of a no kill animal shelter.<br>  <br>  I have 3 dogs whom I would never dream of parting with, they are like my kids.  But if I had to choose between taking my chances with them getting a decent home or being euthanized ,I would have them put to sleep.<br>  <br>  There are so many dogs out there living in horrible homes,  I would never play russian roulette with their lives.<br>  <br>  And the shelters cannot guarantee the dog is going to a loving home, mostly the dog is collected from the shelter and no one knows what happens from there onwards.<br>  <br>  I love my dogs too much to gamble with their lives.<br>  <br>  And I am not selfish.|`|QV2WQsd8aa	In my opinion, as a staff employee at a breed-specific rescue, the thought of a pet being unhappy apart from it's owner is true.  That is why owners should do whatever it takes to not be separated from their beloved pet.  However, it's also very very true that a dog will adapt to what it is surrounded by.  If the shelter or rescue is a well run place, the dogs will have plenty of exercise and space to live comfortably.  Not all rescues and shelters operate with cramped quarters or dogs that are completely stressed out all the time.  The dogs at our rescue, of course want to be surrounded by humans or other dogs most of the time, but they are relatively happy considering their environment.  We are fortunate to have playtime twice a day for each dog in a 2 acre yard plus potty breaks four times a day for a total of six times getting outside and socially interacting.  I understand not all shelters or rescue run this way, but that's why it's important for a loving owner who has got to give up their pet do their research and try to find a well run rescue or shelter and not the first humane society that's in the phone book.<br>  <br>  Enough dogs and cats are euthanized for absurd reasons already.  In my opinion, please give pets the option of continued happiness instead of deciding for them.|`|bsqSaXhQaa	I'm okay with euthanasia in a sense that the dog is dying or won't recover from an injury or other medical reasons.<br>  <br>  But just because you're afraid the dog might be unhappy with someone else is not a reason to put your pet down.  I own a pointer mix who's 12 years old now.  We adopted her from a pet rescue while we were getting our other pet groomed at Petco. Before rescued she was basically left in a muddy yard-no food or water-with a sibling.  Once rescued she lived in foster care until she was 5 (that's when we adopted her. :) ). She's turned out fine and she's probably the sweetest dog you could ever meet and she seems perfectly happy and healthy even after constantly switching homes when she was younger.<br>  <br>  If you don't want your dog, give it to a rescue. They do an amazing job finding good homes!|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Plain and simple, people who think their supposedly precious pet would never be happy with anyone else, are deceiving themselves and incredibly selfish besides.  If they give their pet up to a rescue group, the rescue group will do a better job of finding that pet a loving forever home than the original breeder did if the pet's owner is blithely considering euthanasia.  That mindset is rubbish!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Gees I hope that is not the mindset of all people. Only an extremely selfish person would use this excuse. <br>  The dog would be put up for adoption and the average person that adopts a dog will give it a good home it deserves the chance to live IMPO<br>  Dogs are very resilient and adapt to new situations rather well. <br>  Truthfully the dog wouldn't remember the other life after it adjust to new surroundings
32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	"I'm not letting this go, so what should i do?"<br>  <br>  First of all you need to adjust your attitude.  <br>  <br>  Let it go.  Why perpetuate this situation?  Nothing good will come of it.<br>  <br>  If your dog was leashed and she was walking a leashed dog and her dog wasn't barking and your dog was barking then YOU need to do some obedience training as in teaching your dog not to bark.<br>  <br>  It was your dog that started this by barking.  If she was walking down a public sidewalk in front of your place and her dog was leashed and not doing anything wrong then your dog was the instigator.<br>  <br>  She and her dog also have rights and one of them is to walk down a sidewalk and not be barked at by dogs who are not properly trained such as yours.  At 14 months your dog should be fully trained. <br>  <br>  Get with it and get over your attitude.<br>  <br>  While this lady was wrong in saying what she said it was your dog's barking that started it.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Been there....best to ignore her this time, keep peace in the neighborhood.

Don't keep your dog outside unattended.  That kind of person is the type to throw poison over your fence or do something else equally bad.|`|FaPrr8bbaa	There are look alikes in our neighborhood.  Get your dog a very unusual collar so he will stand out as different from his doppleganger.  My son took it one step farther by catching the look alike out and about and yelling at it until the lady came outside, then he said good boy to his dog who was next to him and (swallow) flipped the neighbor off. I do not recommend the flip part as she has not spoken to anyone since then.  What am I saying? Its been peaceful.|`|GtBOQPKqaa	You could file a report with the police. While they may not be able to do something, it would help your case in the future, as it would help establish a history and a pattern of behavior should she carry out her threat.

Anybody who threatened my dogs would have been told good luck with that. But then again, my dogs don't leave my backyard without a leash. If you know your dog gets excited, why risk the situation by not leashing him while in your front yard? If you cannot control your dog verbally, it should not be off a leash. That may sound harsh, but it is the best preventative, not just from your dog meeting up with someone like that, but from your dog bolting and being hit by a car, or bolting to the wrong dog. What if an unleashed dog comes into your yard? My Staffy mix absolutely hates other dogs, but he wouldn't dare disobey me to leave the backyard and attack another dog, unless it was a threat to his family. <br>  <br>  There really isn't much you can do without making the situation worse. I personally would have gotten into a large verbal dispute with the woman on the street, which is never a good idea. I would honestly let the whole thing go this time, and in the future, not put your dog in that situation. Also, if there is another Shepherd making yours look bad, ask the owner of that dog to keep their animal in check. While it might be frustrating for you that you can't physically do anything, just keep in mind that mouthy idiots usually mouth off to the wrong person one day, because they don't have anything to back it up. Any person who lets their dog off a leash to kill my dog is in for a shock- Because not only will he defend himself, if another dog is attacking my dog unprovoked, then I fight for my dog. Simple. And I'm sure there are many other owners who will agree.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	i would probably lose it on her. not always the best idea though! : ) <br>  go to the woman (not alone) and explain to her that your dog is never out without supervision and will not cause any issues with her dog, but that you dont appreciate being threatened by anyone, especially when it involves your dog. also let her know that pit bulls have a horrible reputation and it's usually caused by people who let them go to purposely harm other dogs or people. that unless people stop doing that the breed is going to end up banned everywhere. also let her know that at if any time you see her dog loose, or on your property you are going to call animal control.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	what a ******! You should have said something when she said it. she's just using it as a scare tactic and to try and show that she's tougher than you.<br>  <br>   I wouldn't even put your energy into it. she's just stupid. and if it ever happened, you could take her to court and win. If you do anything but laugh at her stupidity right now, then you'd be feeing into it.|`|XvDgswalaa	I would stay as far away from this dingbat as I could....she could be trouble for you in the future....It doesn't matter who she is confusing who with.....If she accuses your dog the trouble could be a nightmare....Stay away from these kinds  of stupid people.....|`|Zq6idWtfaa	shes most likely being a jerk and u shouldnt let it get 2 u, but if she continues 2 make these threats, call the cops.|`|DCHSE8qDaa	same happended to me with my lab/blue healer mix. the only thing you can do is call the cops they wont do anything or let it go.....|`|3giaPYe8aa	ALL dogs should be kept on a leash when they are not in a fenced yard.

She is obviously not logical so you aren't going to be able to talk any sense into her. All you will accomplish is getting more frustrated and making her angrier at you.<br>  <br>  File a police report. Were there any witnesses? If so, get their okay to provide their contact info to the police for back up. Personally, I would start carrying a camera or tape recorder with me on walks so that if you come across her again you can document any threats she makes. Evidence goes a lot further than "he said, she said."

Or you could just let her tire herself out. Grab some cat toys and play with her!<br>  But whatever you do, DO NOT spray her with water. I know this one guy who would dump water on his cat if she wasn't calming down. Personally, I don't agree with that.<br>  If she doesn't settle down in the next hmmm, I'd say 2 or 3 days you'd be better off calling the vet, just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)|`|6768c11da3a7523681b339d4d16ff8b6aa	Who knows what motives lurk in the hearts of our cats? Cats have lived with me my whole life. I have never been able to totally figure them out. I can say that occasional periods of frenetic behavior such as you describe are not uncommon. I usually feel that the cat herself doesn't know what she wants. She wants your undivided attention but doesn't know whether for play or snuggles. Try to comply. By the end of the day she will probably return to her normal stuck-up state.|`|zGvcNgTtaa	Sounds like she's hyped up and wants attention, just grab her and give her some loving, pet her and hold her or try to play with her.

And have adorable personalities.  Soft and loving, comical voices, follow you around, run to meet you at the door, accompany you to the toilet, sleep curled up with you.  I know that applies to most breeds.  Birmans have the personality of the active breeds with the gentleness of the lazy breeds, plus they're goodnatured.  They're the perfect balance.  And they happen to be incredibly beautiful to look at.  (And their fur doesnt tangle unlike most other longhaired beauties)|`|4aAhEK9daa	Well, I think all cats have their own cuteness about them but as a breed overall - the Exotic Shorthair.  They just feel like little teddy bears and have the cutest faces.  Exotics are the shorthaired version of the Persian. They have the round head and eyes, flat face, small ears, cobby body shape and shorter tails of the Persian but in this short, plus coat.  It's SOOOO thick and soft.  They give the image of being much heavier than they are - they truly are "not fat - I'm fluffy!"  They also have a very sweet disposition and love to be where their owners are.<br>  <br>  I adopted my Exotic Shorthair from the shelter I volunteer when she was four years old.  I've had her about a year and a half now and she bonded to me almost instantly.  I own my own biz and work out of my home and she's ALWAYS right next to me while I work on my notebook at the futon.  And if I get up to get something in my office and I sit down in there she'll come in there and meow at me till I move my arm so she can hop to my lap and then flop herself over on my desk.<br>  <br>  Very sweet, laid back adaptable cats.  But then, most adult shelter cats are - adopt the adults!<br>  <br>  Here's a couple vids of her:<br>  <br>  This was only a couple days after adopting her<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pyL8acR6zk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pyL8acR6...</a><br>  Up in BC for a show (she shows as a Household Pet with TICA)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ15S6B4RGY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ15S6B4R...</a><br>  <br>  Can you believe all this kitty and she's only 9 pounds?<br>  <a href="http://www.ferretocious.com/penelope/penny-ta6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretocious.com/penelope/pen...</a>|`|qc9iax2maa	I love munchkin cats, even though I don't have one! :D<br>  But I love my kitties too :3|`|pw8u5WQ9aa	Wow that's kinda hard to do.

FcR8G8hPaa	In my opinion, what you will learn from training this horse is far more important than what height you jump. This horse presents some classic problems that you will have to deal with on many horses, whether your intent is to be a rider or trainer. This horse has (from your description) inadequate training for "go" and the conflicts in his training (probably typical jumping horse conflicts between "stop" and "go" arising from excessive contact) plus uncertainty about expected responses to stimuli and insufficient concentration on the rider's aids are what leads to his spookiness. If you focus on training this horse's "go" responses to be light and work on lead line "stand" and "relax" for quietness, you will learn many things about how to train. And you will greatly improve this horse.<br>  <br>  Here are two sites for reference which will give you some great information to get the most out of this training opportunity.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.meredithmanor.com/features/articles/default.asp#Train" rel="nofollow">http://www.meredithmanor.com/features/ar...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aebc.com.au/articles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aebc.com.au/articles/</a><br>  <br>  Also note that if the horse hasn't been ridden for longer than three months, it will take about three months to fully recondition the horse to its former level. I have some articles about conditioning linked from this page:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.temporaldoorway.com/stable/links.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.temporaldoorway.com/stable/li...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|9JIZZG0oaa	you will still progress. i had a VERY late start, i began riding at 12. i know, dont laugh. but now im 17, and im already competing at 1.1m-1.2m jumpers and intermediate novice eventing. if you put everything you'v got into the time you spend on a horse, you can still progress rapidly.|`|3VaF9gH0aa	If jumping this height is all you can do at this time then just make the most of it. Getting small jumps perfect can help you with bigger jumps, rather than throwing yourself in at the deep end. Striding and balance are the most important things when jumping big and you can practice these jumping small. <br>  <br>  At some point you will need to jump some big jumps because it is psychological and you will need to do it to build up confidence. But I know from personal experience that this will only take a few weeks, maybe 2 months at the most. I jumped probably 3ft max for 5 years, and this was BIG to me. Then I changed instructors and 1 month later I was jumping 4ft+ easily, and even cleared the top of the wings.<br>  <br>  If you get to a stage where you apply to college, just ride more often because its amazing how much difference a few weeks of concentrated work can make a difference. I wouldn't worry yet about progressing because chances are you will without even noticing, and if not you have plenty of time.|`|yNHBBQ6faa	slow and steady wins the race.......seriously!!!<br>  <br>  for example...<br>  rider 1 can jump 5'' on a well schooled horse but can't cope with difficult horses and has poor basic flat work,<br>  rider 2 only jumps 3'' at the most but can ride any kind of horse and has a perfect position and really good flat work....<br>  <br>  who's the better rider? probably rider 2, because all though she doesn't jump as high she has better riding skills!!<br>  <br>  it's not about how high you jump or how fast you go, it's about how well you ride and by riding these two horses you'll be equipped for life with a stable and correct approach to riding and good strong flat work....not to mention a good bond between the horses!!!!|`|RI23G0Awaa	its always best to build on the basics, even if you can do all the harder stuff, its a chance to get better at the simple stuff without being pushed too far. riding Aspen will be good to strengthen your legs, and get you used to spooky ponies, so you can still get better at everything. you will get plenty of chance in the future to practise the harder stuff :) hope this helps :D|`|BIshtm7oaa	You will definitely progress. Especially since you are riding another horse whom you are not used to. Aspen will make you a better rider in my opinion. You don't need a trainer all the time, sometimes the horses are the best teachers. <br>  <br>  One thing that will help you get ready for your riding college is to focus more on the moment. If you're so worried about getting enough riding experience to get into your college you won't be able to focus as much on being a good rider and having a good relationship with your horse.|`|ZDFw8o1Saa	Don't worry about progressing quickly.  the best way to do well with horse back riding is to go at a steady pace that fits your needs as a rider.I too am fifteen and got a late start riding.  (I was eleven)<br>  I jump three foot on some horses though, inadvertently, I've done five foot on a mare who thought a six inch cross rail was, needless to say, much taller.  *sigh* school horses<br>  <br>  I think you'll be in shape to go to a riding college.  Your progressing just as you need to.  Work your way up slowly.  And congratulations on getting to ride that horses.<br>  <br>  Thoroughbredtrainin'girl|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	If your trainer is anything like mine she moves at a VERY slow slow pace. Just because your not jumping 4' fences doesn't mean your any less of a rider. There are plenty of people out there who jump 4' who have no idea what they are doing, and look like crap. But with going slow you'll know what your doing and look nice.<br>  <br>  Eventually you'll be able to move up.|`|htq1LqEeaa	Oh my gosh, yes your riding will progress! The more riding you do and the more different horses you ride is excellent! Practice is the key. If I may also make a suggestion. I do not know where you are from but, you could also apply to Spruce Meadows in Calgary Alberta, Canada. I worked there when i was 18 and it was such a wonderful experience! I learned so much there, there are accomidations right on the property, all of us grooms each had a horse to ride and a lesson (flat work and jumping) everyday, when we where ready they also moved us up to better and better horses. We did the stalls, all the feedings, excellent housekeeping of the barns, everything, and we got paid! We where involved in the big shows they put on, just simply and amazing experience! If you are there long enough, or if someone should quit in the training barn and you are a dedicated reliable worker there is also a chance to move into the training barn, groom for the trainers and travel with them across the country to different shows.<br>  Good luck and keep riding as many as you can.<br>  I do not want you to think i am steering you away from college because education is really very important!<br>  Enjoy!|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	Do not worry about not progressing quickly enough.  2'9 is not a bad training height for any horse.  You should be saving height for shows so that horses only get to jump the higher jumps one or two days before a show.  <br>  <br>  Believe me, however good you are or bad a decent equestrian college will transform you all the way through.  You are best going to a college with the attitude that you know nothing.  People who think they know everything before they get to college are in for a rough time.  They are arrogant and difficult to train.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	You have plenty of time, just keep working at it diligently.<br>  And make sure your trainer is aware of your goals
bsqSaXhQaa	Maybe tap him on the snout sternly when he cries and tell him no!<br>  <br>  Let him know what's allowed and what's not. You're the pack leader, not him. He gets your attention when you decide to give it to him, not when he demands it.|`|GSf09ALBaa	You have some serious behavior problems.  Some dogs are just geared to be more needy than others.  Your problem sounds like it is become overwhelming.  <br>  <br>  At this point I would search out a good behaviorist.  These are  trainers who have gone the extra step and taken courses in dog behavior.  <br>  <br>  This little guy needs some assessment.|`|wAzNCS48aa	Does he have any toys? He may just be lonely =) I have a basset that cries all the time but I also have 2 other dogs to comfort her.
2u8teJkJaa	I feed my chihuahua twice a day. 7 am in the morning and about 6 pm at night. Her food is never out to free feed. She is kept on a schedule. You need to pick up the food after 20 minutes. He will learn to eat when you put it out. Do not give in at 1 am in the morning you are only setting yourself up.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	My dogs get fed twice a day and that's it.  Anything he doesn't eat in 20 minutes should be picked up.  It may take a few days for him to get used to the new routine, but he'll get it.  It will put a stop to him getting up for a late night snack and potentially keep mice, ants and rats out of his food.  And you can provide him water in the house for him to get himself.|`|FaPrr8bbaa	My chihuahua eats at between 5:30 and 6:30 am and then again between 4:00 and 5:00 pm.  She does talk me into a tablespoon extra kibble between these two meals but never after.  She has water anytime she wants but only because she has proven that she can sleep through the night. <br>  If his waking you means he never wees or poos in the house then you have been truly blessed. My girl chi is learning outdoor skills after her previous owner taught her pee pads.  Good Luck|`|kvHqnR5Haa	I would take his food and water away about two hours before you go to bed.  That should give him plenty of time to get it out of his system before bedtime.  Good luck!|`|GKGQQaObaa	Feed him one tablespoon of syrup every day. He might live he might not|`|7DpmGblgaa	it is probably best to stop feeding your dog between 4pm and 6m! this will give the dog a chance to digest the food and go outside before bedtime. my dogs get fed twice a day and never get fed after 6pm. i made that mistake of feeding them after this time at the start and was been wakened through the night to let them out - now i have no problems!|`|y2qXV7i8aa	When i first was got my dog i took her to the vet get spade the vet was asking me all kinds of questions and then he came up on the subject of her eating habits and my vet told me that a dog should be fed past 6 or 7 o'clock depending on your work schedule. and only feed it two times a day its okay to give him/her snacks.|`|QqEE3qgOaa	my dog used to do that so what i did was feed her in morning at around 10 or 11  in the morning so by the time she goes to bed she has nothing in her stomach and as the water goes i keep that out all day about an hour before you go you got to bed bring him out and then right before you go to bed bring him out again hope this helped|`|quIxcugeaa	I know that my 2 dogs tend to need to go #2 within 15-20 minutes of eating, so I feed them at 6am and 6pm, and it seems to work well.  If I leave a bowl of food out, they would gorge themselves and mess in the house.|`|XIH2oKtJaa	feed it about 3 meals a day, but the last meal at tea time and take the food up at about six this way it has plenty of time to go to toilet before bed! and won be waking you up. or you could keep it in a crate then it shouldnt poop where it sleeps.|`|Rgb3WkXVaa	I have two Labs and I only feed them once a day. And those are Labs! So you could start feeding him twice a day and then drop it down to once a day. I think he'll survive! Hope this helps!!!|`|0QTCiCf8aa	you should consider only feeding him 2 meals a day and leave a constant water supply. free feeding, which is normally ok in small dogs, can cause an overweight and unpredictable pooping time. if you know when he eats then you know when he needs to go. take the water away after the last time you are going to let him out before bed. unless he has a medical problem he will be fine with out water overnight. Good luck!

hBE2UWOkaa	The mercury thermometers aren't made for checking water temp.  Buy an aquarium thermometer at Wal Mart or the pet store for a couple of dollars.  Place the thermometer on the outside of the tank.  <br>  Under NO circumstance do you plug the heater in before it is in the water.  It could shatter when placed into the colder water.  Put the heater in the water, and set the dial on the top of the heater at about the midpoint, let it set for about an hour, then plug it in.  You should see an indicator light come on(depends on brand of heater).  Wait at least  an hour to check the temp.  Move the dial closer to plus or minus to adjust the temp up or down.  Wait at least an hour and check the temp again.|`|xm3iMOdvaa	I bought a heater from Wal Mart that's fully submersible for $20 and it's working great so far. My water temp. is staying right at 76. It even has a automatic shut off (a little red light shows when the heater is on). The heaters at the Pet Stores are a lot more expensive!|`|a3FAGYgVaa	First, give your heater some time to warm the water up, also, make sure you use a good thermometer, placed at the oposite of your heater. Submersible thermometers work good, stick-on thermometers are far from being accurate. Oh, and NO mercury (the silver looking liquid type), go for the red typed ones, if your mercury thermometer breaks (and it is easy if you bump it accidentally), you can say bye bye to your tank, all of it, tank included.<br>  <br>  Also remember that 5 gallons is a small volume of water, which means that it can loose it's heat to the ambiant room temp much more easily.<br>  <br>  How many watts of power do your water heater have? For that volume a 20 watts minimum is recommended, 50 watts would be perfect.<br>  <br>  When installing the water heater, it whould be placed in the water and let to rest there at least 15 min BEFORE you plug it in. this is to insure that the internal thermostat settles or something.<br>  <br>  NEVER plug a water heater and warm it up out of water, that will break it and could cause you severe burns. And don't pick up a water heater that has just been working, it WILL be hot.|`|xAFDC9xhaa	I suggest going to either wal-mart or your local pet shop and getting a electronic thermometer. Mine cost $7.99 and has a probe that suction cups to the inside of the tank. I feel it gives the most accurate tank temp. As for Betta's they don't need filtration or a heater they are happier in smaller tanks 1 gallon or less. These fish live naturally in Rice patties and tend to like murky water. I have had betta last in Tiny bowls for 3 years! I think the only reason it died was because my then 4 year old fed it a half a jar of food.  Hope this helps!|`|w4DIPHf1aa	Put the heater very close to the filter...<br>  <br>  Heaters work far better when put close to the intake of the filter.<br>  <br>  aswell the heater needs to be put in the tank unplugged for about 15 mins to set it's internal thermostat. <br>  <br>  then plug in an go.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|101bfea0cfc2e9bab98441d37836406eaa	What type of heaters are these, that aren't working for you?<br>  <br>  All I can think is that they are either the type that only raises the temp by 3 degrees, or you aren't giving it enough time, or you somehow broke, or got defective heaters.<br>  <br>  I'd return the heaters as broken.<br>  <br>  I don't see what you could be doing wrong (except maybe just not giving the heater enough time before deciding it isn't heating the water right).  All I can do is recommend a better quality heater.<br>  <br>  In my view, by far the best heater is the Stealth. It has become the only heater I will use. It is accurate, shatterproof and durable and has overheat protection so you can remove it from the water without having to unplug it. It tends to be expensive in stores, but is more reasonable price at thatpetplace.com.<br>  I have shopped there, and find it to be a very reliable and safe online store and standard delivery is superfast.<br>  This heater, even online, is more expensive than some you can find, but I have been fishkeeping for 10 years, and have been through lots of heaters, and this one is well worth the money. It is worth it to not go on vacation and come back finding your fish cooked. And I don't like to spend a lot of money. I am always looking for shortcuts.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to the product. You'd want the 25 watt one.<br>  <a href="http://www.thatpetplace.com/pet/group/11432/product.web" rel="nofollow">http://www.thatpetplace.com/pet/group/11...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You can start your cycle any time without worrying about a heater if you do a fishless cycle.<br>  Here are two articles about fishless cycling.<br>  <a href="http://www.skepticalaquarist.com/docs/startover/fishless.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.skepticalaquarist.com/docs/st...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tropicalfishcentre.co.uk/Fishlesscycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tropicalfishcentre.co.uk/Fish...</a><br>  <br>  Lastly, I hope you know that bettas DO need a filter, and DO need more than a gallon of space.  The puddles in Thailand rice paddies that they live in only happen during the dry season, first off. The rest of the year, wild bettas have the whole darned rice paddy!! And those puddles are far more than a gallon of water. They tend to be a foot in diameter and 6 inches deep at the smallest, that's a bare minimum of 3 gallons, and bettas tend to jump out of the small ones looking for more space.  That 5 gallon tank is perfect for a betta, and you will have a far more active and interesting fish for it! <br>  <br>  The only thing with bettas and filters is that they don't tolerate much current very well.  If you have a sponge filter, this is not a problem.  If you have a hang-on-back type, here's a DIY article on how to buffer the flow.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petfish.net/kb/entry/347/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfish.net/kb/entry/347/</a><br>  <br>  Have fun with your new fish!!

KEYgd73saa	There is a good chance that it's simply not a very healthy fish whose kidneys are failing.  The salt and malachite green would certainly not be handled well by such a fish, as both will do quite a number on the already-damaged kidneys.  It could have any of the many viral, bacterial, or fungal kidney infections, or the results of poor treatment in the store.  The best thing I can recommend is to isolate the Platy in question and keep her tank very clean.  This is also a good idea for the simple reason that your tank is overstocked.  "Dwarf Platies" actually don't get any smaller than "regular" Platies, despite the name, so you'd really be well served to narrow it down to 3-4 Platies, or get yourself a 10 gallon tank.  If one of your females gets pregnant, you'll be in real trouble with all the fry quickly overpopulating the tank.
1SSJeFHQaa	it takes heat to raise the humidity. Boiling water is the essayist way.|`|OAzJPUkHaa	The tank should be in the good 75-80% range for good breathing and activity.  I don't recommend leaving it 50% every night.  A hygrometer is the best way to tell how humid the tat is.  Condensation and simply feeling how humid the tank is really isn't accurate unless you absolutely know what you're doing.  A cheap hygrometer/thermometer combo is easy to find in Wal Mart(if you already know/have this stuff, ignore it)<br>  Raising your humidity should have any affect on your temperature.  You can spray the tank, but that can get pretty annoying as you'll need to spray often.  I really only use misting as a quick fix.  Moist substrate, moss pits, and home made humidifiers will do the job of keeping a nice humid tank.<br>  Poke a little hole in a corner of substrate and gently pour water into it when ever the substrate starts drying. Soaking the substrate would most likely make it too moist for proper burrowing.  Properly prepare moss by letting it moisten in salt water and sticking it in the microwave for a few seconds. You can stick it in a second level or a corner in your tank. This is a pretty good humidifier you can make.<br>  <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/The-10-H..." rel="nofollow">http://www.instructables.com/id/The-10-H...</a><br>  This is has pretty good info on moss. <a href="http://naturallycrabby.com/home/blog1.ph..." rel="nofollow">http://naturallycrabby.com/home/blog1.ph...</a><br>  Hiawatha moss is a pretty safe to use.<br>  I really don't recommend sponges.  They don't increase humidity as well as moss will. If you do get sponges, they don't need to be kept in any of you water bowls. They'll probably just take up precious water space. Sticking them in a clam shell on their own would be fine. Have at least two(preferably more) sponges to alternate between them. Sterilize the sponge used in the tank daily, as they're perfect for breeding harmful bacteria(I think they're a waste of money).|`|O1VcREmJaa	I work at a pet store. We mist them twice a day. We soak the substrate. We don't just dampen it. There are also humidifiers for reptiles if you are willing to spend the money. Honestly though you can just mist them before you leave for work and when you get home. If yo'd like you can also do it once more before bed. They like really high humidities so its not very likely you'll get it higher than they enjoy.|`|IFEIP5Doaa	Misting the tank down well twice a day will allow your aquarium to reach about 70-80 percent with a normal low of around 50%. Basicly when you wake up in the morning, spray them down really well. Then by mid afternoon their humidity will be around 70%, by early evening it will be around 50%. Before night falls mist them down again and they will be good until morning.

veDvtYhJaa	Read up on both breeds.  Make notes of normal sizes of both breeds.  She can be anywhere in between these two standards.  <br>  <br>  AND... if you can talk to the breeder, find out the height at the withers and the weight of each of this pup's parents.  That's your BEST judge.<br>  <br>  Mixed breeds can have a zillion varied combinations of parental looks, health traits, and personality traits.  If the pup will be large, she should have large paws about now.  Roughly around 4mo, large breed pups paws grow to adult size as a hint of what is to come. <br>  <br>  If you add her weight at 4mo, I can give you a rough idea, possibly as my dogs are large breed dogs. Pups grow in spurts to large breed size.  One month the paws get big, another month the legs get long. Some months they look really odd. It's fun to keep a photographic record.  I hope you can do that. -!-|`|UaQoFCxCaa	If she truly is a husky/lab mix, then she will probably grow to be somewhere in the middle of the 2 size-wise.

The markings she has now are a good indication, but may darken or look different when she forms to an adult.

v0RsFaAzaa	The list is endless on why her mouth is swollen! It could be that she was stung by something, bit by something, she could have something stuck in her mouth, she could have a bad tooth, etc... If she was stung by something, her throat could be the next thing to swell, she will eventually stop breathing and you will lose her, if it does swell and you don't get her help! Whatever it is, it needs to be taken care of very soon! We cannot diagnose your dog over the Internet. We would only be guessing what's wrong and that will not help your dogs situation any.

It should be remembered that just like with humans treats are just that a treat, they shouldn't be eating a box a day. You might also want to look into Greenies, which are like dog bones, only they help clean your dog's teeth which is extremely important if you don't brush their choppers once in a while. <br>  <br>  Carrots, peeled and cut apples, and applesauce are other good treats, Carrots are great for the eyes and I haven't met a dog that didn't love them. Apples and applesauce are also normally well received and are normally given to dogs who suffer from constipation. <br>  <br>  Peanut butter is of course a doggie favorite, I'd recommend getting a Kong brand rubber toy and putting some peanut butter in it.

FoeyqAZqaa	Dog blood in stool can be caused by many things, including:<br>  * Your dog might have eaten something really sharp that is cutting him internally<br>  * A scratch near the anus or from straining to defecate <br>  * Parasites (hookworm, whipworm) <br>  * Bacteria<br>  * Protozoa (coccidiosis) * Viral infections, such as parvo virus<br>  * Small intestine problems (hematochezia) <br>  * Colon or Rectum bleeding/polyps<br>  * Bowel cancer (neoplasia) <br>  * Canine Anal Sac Infection<br>  * Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD)<br>  * Food intolerance<br>  * Blood clotting problem<br>  * Allergy<br>  * Bowel malformation (Intussusception)<br>  <br>  The condition is usually caused by some type of problem that is affecting the intestinal tract. In older dogs blood could mean cancer while in younger dogs it is usually indicative of a parasite problem. One incident with bright red blood is usually not a cause for great concern. Repeated episodes could indicate something that needs immediate treatment.<br>  <br>  If the blood is only on the outside of the stool then the bleeding is from the anal canal. It is common for dogs with this condition to try and pass their stools while standing up. This condition can be caused by some type of obstruction such as an enlarged prostate, a foreign object that your dog ingested, or a fracture of the pelvic bone.|`|X4umNoGzaa	take him to another vet for a second opinion.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I would gradually change the formula his food over the next week and see if that helps.

TYohMrlXaa	Can't really see why, if it's getting the water out you've gotta have some suction. Well you do have to twist it down into the gravel, if you just run it over the top of the gravel like a real vacuum it wouldn't get anything. :)<br>  <br>  Are your fish looking stressed? Do you have an ammonia testing kit?      I bet you could wait until Sat and be fine, but I don't think it would be a really big deal if you wanted to try again today or tomorrow.|`|hBE2UWOkaa	I bought an electric pump that circulates the water through a filter bag.  No need to remove water.  Costs about 20 bucks.|`|oMmBhWK4aa	There are some variations in gravel vacuums, wasn't there any instructions on the packaging of yours? You may have to stick it into the gravel slightly and jiggle it about, while some only need to be held slightly above the gravel. There should be a grid or mesh that prevents larger gravel bits from being sucked away. But I far prefer battery operated electric ones that don't require multi-tasking eyeballs trying to notice debris to suck and rapidly rising water level in your bucket all at the same time. And I think you're doing water changes too frequently, unless you have no filter. Not only does it stress fish but you risk playing havoc with water parameters yo-yoing. Once a week is enough, unless you have a small tank, poor or no filter and very sensitive fish.|`|tShDXmgbaa	You are doing too many water changes back to back.  The best way to use the gravel vaccum is to shake the siphon end very vigorously up and down in the tank water.  The water will start going into the bucket very fast and you will no longer hear water sloshing in the gravel cleaner. It is at this point you have a good suction going and you should now be able to stick the siphon down in the gravel and suck up debris. Move the vacuum all around the tank to suck up debris from all areas of the tank.  If  you are siphon the gravel...you dont worry about water coming out from the inner tank as the water you siphon from the gravel is also sucking water from throughout the tank..just from the bottom.  You should only be taken out 2-3 gallons of water per 10 gallons of tank water.  Water changes should be done either bi-weekly or once a month on a regular basis.  I have 5 tanks going and I only go in and do water changes once a month. I have homemade sponge filters that never needs replacing just a good rinse every now and then.  Too often water changes will keep your tank uncycled and also keep your fish stressed. If you still cant get the vacuum gravel to work properly....just stirred the gravel by hand and then suck it out as the debris will float so you can suck it up. I discontinued use of the electric siphon pumps because even though they catch debris...my water was never crystal clear and always had a yellow discoloration.
6SeWCfUfaa	I would be upfront with them about it.  It's not like you planned it.  I would also set a date by which all the puppies will be out and make sure I stick to that.  The landlord might be mad, but he'll be less mad if you go to them with a clear plan on how you're going to keep the apartment clean and keep it from being destroyed by the pups, then they'll be if they suddenly discover you have puppies.  By the time the pups are  4-5 weeks old, there will be no hiding it.<br>  <br>  And for the uneducated that think spaying is totally safe no matter where in the pregnancy a dog is:  <br>  <br>  There is an increased risk to the female when she is spayed during pregnancy versus when she is spayed routinely.  The blood vessels of her reproductive tract become huge and more difficult to tie off during pregnancy. The surgery takes longer and there is usually an extra charge for this. Sometimes she must stay an extra day in the hospital or wear a bandage around her belly at home. The surgical scar will be much longer than it would for a routine spay. The risk of excessive bleeding is greater, the bigger the dog and the more advanced the pregnancy.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	You're better off telling the landlord than risking an eviction if he discovers them and it violates the terms of your lease.|`|wAzNCS48aa	Take the puppies to the shelter where you adopted the dog from if they are healthy they should get adopted pretty fast.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	SPAY TODAY!!!!<br>  BEFORE there's another litter of crap in the world *&* before you get kicked out into the street!!!!|`|y2qXV7i8aa	No dont tell your landlord, but unfortunatly you have to give the puppies away. because most land lords dont except dogs or either charge a higher price for every dog you have. so its best that you dont tell them.|`|qapJU3tMaa	Spaying and aborting is NOT a high risk procedure.  Sounds like you need to find a more competent vet.  Please take her to another vet and have her aborted, please do not bring more unwanted pups into this world.|`|bsqSaXhQaa	I would tell the landlord.<br>  It's not like you bred the dog. It was an accident and as long as you don't plan on keeping them, I'm sure they'll understand just fine.|`|AA10674670	no|`|FoeyqAZqaa	The landlord should understand your situation. I would tell him, because if he does find out about them and you didn't tell him then you could get evicted.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	Did you adopt this dog from a shelter? or a friend? that is really strange. I personally would not tell my landlord if you think you can keep it from them for the 8 weeks. If you tell them it might not be OK with them and then you could find yourself in a pickle. I would wait it out if she finds out make it seem like you did not think to tell her, not that you blatantly decided not to. I am sorry that you have to deal with this. Good Luck!|`|k6flESfNaa	ok, whoever said to spay today---- a little late for ain't it?<br>  <br>  <br>  >.<<br>  <br>  <br>  yes you should tell your landlord, he has every right to know. you really had Better tell him, have you any idea how bad puppies can smell, and the noise they make? also, he may know people around the complexes who might want to adopt a puppy. <br>  <br>  but yes definitely tell him!
Amkmles0aa	report it now<br>  have a god day|`|DtkLsetkaa	She needs to be reported to the RSPA and the cops as well.  That's animal abuse.  This is exactly why we preach about backyard breeders.|`|AA11451457	Aw poor little thing :( and not nice for you either seeing such a nasty scene. Defo report her to RSPCA and local police should know about it too, give them a call on the non emergency number (look on www.yell.com for police in your area, rather than calling 999)<br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Yes, report immediately.  Indiscriminate breeding like this should be stopped - it is disgraceful.|`|XbmZu0zKaa	report her.and why would you give her the kitten back?|`|UNFxjNHkaa	yes!  Definitely report this woman NOW!  <br>  She told you that you didnt care about the kitten?!  Is she kidding?!!<br>  She obviously doesnt care for any of her animals.  She gave you that kitten sick and when it was only 4 weeks old.. thats not even old enough for it to be away from its mother.  <br>  <br>  report her, now.<br>  <br>  If you dont want to do it, I will.  I cant stand seeing or hearing of animals that have to live with poor living conditions.<br>  <br>  The father had sores down its back and eyes crusted shut?  He needs medical attention.  She's neglecting her animals and breeding them just to make a quick buck.|`|ApG0DpzXaa	Yes, report her to the RSPCA, to your local siamese rescue, and to the better business bureau.|`|nbUpqg04aa	report, report, report ASAP!|`|qJrNkMpUaa	Yes, definately report it! kittens should be 8 weeks old when they leave their mothers!|`|78ouhV4caa	yes please report them.

I'm glad to see someone who cares :)<br>  yes, this is for the RSPCA. You should call as soon as possible! I can't believe them! Those cats are suffering and she doesn't care?!

AA10959572	Male cat?<br>  <br>  hormones possibly?... get it "fixed" <br>  <br>  Otherwise, he might have an injury or infection that's hurting and being an animal, he's reacting as per instinct, by lashing out.<br>  <br>  Either way, get it checked.|`|qc9iax2maa	you need to get him neutered soon. Also since he's been traveling a lot in the car, maybe he's afraid of people because he knows that they lock him in a car. But no worries, all you need to do is play with him and give him treats every now and then. He'll be back to himself in no time! Except it might be from hormones triggering stress, so you should get him neutered as soon as possible. Maybe you should take him to the vet, if he's not acting himself soon. He may have another sickness.|`|wrhG6b1laa	4 months hm-mm..  try giving him allot of attention with toys and cat nip. maybe he is just lonely and he may need a friend. see if you can barrow a kitten too see if it will help.|`|6uYVRaebaa	you need to get him fixed at the vet, tom cats get like that|`|TwBgfWFraa	He is probably just scared from being in a carrier, going in the car, and being places that he is not used to. He is still very young, so all these things are new to him. Give him a little time and he should forget all about the experience. You can try giving him a couple extra treats, or maybe try and play with him with the laser pointer (cats go nuts for that). Do not force anything on him as it will just traumatise him even more. If in about a week he dosent start behaving better you may want to take him to a vet and have him examined. He may have an anxiety condition that can be treated with certain medication.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|L1EccMeZaa	There are a variety of reasons why a cat would change so drastically. Hormones from not being fixed, which you should get done as soon as you can before he starts to spray. There's also territorial issues if there's another cat hanging around.<br>  <br>  It could be stress related. Our feline friends tend to get stressed pretty easily.<br>  <br>  Another would be an illness that is causing him discomfort. I suggest a vet visit just to be on the safe side.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Either he has an injury or illness that you are unaware of or he has become stressed by too much moving around - cats do not like being away from their environment.<br>  <br>  Try to determine whether he growls/hisses when you touch a particular part of him - if he does then you need to take him to the vet.  <br>  <br>  If you think it is stress related rather than physical then you should try Feliway Artificial Pheromone Diffusers.  Plug some in around your home (particularly in the rooms used mainly by your cat) and they will calm and reassure him.
veDvtYhJaa	It depends on what chemicals.  <br>  <br>  Antifreeze has chemicals that make it smell sweet, and that is why so many dogs have, over the years, eaten it and poisoned themselves.  Laws have been finally passed to force the manufacturers to give the antifreeze a bitter, obnoxious taste and smell to stop this from happening.<br>  <br>  Generally it's only things that smell good tasting that they are drawn to.  Dogs are not drawn to eat all chemicals. -!-|`|AA11085356	They don't kno that something is bad for them. And a lot of chemicals smell good to them.|`|SbLeCOjZaa	Dogs are very curious in nature and their curiosity could be what gets the best of them.|`|TepAZAHyaa	Because they smell good to them and like the one person said they can't read labels--but I don't agree with the DUMB part. That's why it's up to us to be sure things that are harmful to them are kept out of reach.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	They're naturally curious. And remember, their nose is extremely strong, way stronger than ours, and these smells draw them in.|`|9RuBwanoaa	i think they kight like but not drink a whole gallon.<br>  <br>  there just curious little things.|`|PdcQyis5aa	because some chemicals like antifreeze have a sweet taste to them.
veDvtYhJaa	This is a really hard decision, and we cannot make it for you.  <br>  <br>  I did a slide series for a vet friend who's setting up a support group for people in Raleigh, NC for people in your difficult situation.  What you have to consider is this:<br>  where there is no quality of life,  there is no real life....<br>  <br>  You need to consider if he's got more painful, unhappy times than happy and comfortable times. <br>  <br>  You will feel pain over his loss no matter when you lose him, but you need to see if he's got any joy in his life, and if it's enough to warrant his wanting to continue.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes letting go of ones we love is the deepest act of love we can perform. <br>  <br>  If he can't walk, then he can't leave his current spot to go potty, and that's not good.  <br>  <br>  Talk to your vet and discuss if this is the right time to put him down.  It's certainly time to consider it.  But I cannot make that decision for you.  If you feel it's time to let him go to the rainbow bridge, then I totally support your decision. -!-|`|AA12128656	only you and your vet can decide that. if you really feel that he's suffering and has no quality of life, then it's probably time to go.<br>  <br>  have the vet evaluate him before you make your decision. they can give you a better idea of whether he's in pain, and take into consideration that he's not walking.|`|24CFl7sjaa	Are you ready to say goodbye?|`|AA10400143	If he is still eating, then he is not ready to give up. has the vet put him on meds for the seizures? They should have by now.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	It's all about quality of life and it seems your dog no longer has quality. I'm sorry but it does sound like time to let him go.<br>  Take him to the vet and stay with him while he goes peacefully.|`|6440aca54e76133287a99d198c3d1a37aa	that's a really hard call to make, but from what you have written I would say yes.|`|S5Lz35myaa	As hard as it sounds, I would say yes.  From what you have said, it does not sound like he has any quality of life left, and putting him down, while hard on the people, is the kindest thing you can do for the dog.|`|HgMFrllLaa	IMHO your dog is still enjoying life in his own way. He's also pain free and fully continent.<br>  Don't rush into things.<br>  Late Entry : the "not walking" part is most likely a result of the last seizure and will go away.|`|4AmASNXUaa	I am soooo sorry. My  old dog died because she couldn't walk. I loved her and i am sure you love you dog. Make the last days or hours the best time of his life. : ) put him out of his misery . Sorry.|`|uNfWYSfJaa	I think so it sounds like hes dieing so you might as well put him out of his misery.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	Yes, it is time.<br>  <br>  R I P|`|GtBOQPKqaa	You have my sympathies.<br>  <br>  I, too, found myself in a similar situation over fifteen years ago with our beloved Patches, a beagle-sheltie mix as sweet as the day is long.<br>  <br>  Near the end of her life - she was sixteen when we euthanized her - she suffered a variety of maladies due to old age. At one point, while thinking about her, I got to thinking about additional measures to prolong her life, and that led me to this question: For whose benefit are we doing it, ours or the dog's? Once I saw it framed like that, it made the decision easier - not any less painful, however.<br>  <br>  Because of how long we'd had her, letting her go was the most painful thing I'd ever done. My sister and I were at the vet's for the procedure, and were by her side when the vet injected the drugs. As she passed away, the expression on her face said, "Thank you for loving me." Since then, whenever I think about Patches, I realize that my decision to put her down was what I call "a final act of love."<br>  <br>  (Incidentally, my father passed away eight years later, and the two are now together in heaven.)<br>  <br>  Ultimately, none of us can tell you whether to put him down. If your vet says antiseizure drugs are a viable and economical means of improving his quality of life, then that may be the route to take. Conversely, if it wouldn't be humane, then euthanasia would be the way to go. Either way, get your vet's input.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|KuUx34hCaa	I have had raised dog for over 60yrs. & as hard as it is I would say YES no ? about it it's not fair to our pets to let them suffer & with seizures that is suffering we as humans are selfish & want to keep our pet with us at any cost why let her go to sleep in dignity I have had to do it many times over my 70 years of living & it NEVER gets easier but I love my pets enough NOT to let them suffer just because I (I) want to keep them that would be cruel my heart goes out to you please make the right choice|`|jPyh5GXWaa	Hey buddy if a being cannot walk that does not makes its life worthless. We go through certain stages of life which are sometimes easy and sometimes hard. Just encourage your dog to play with you or go for a walk with you, it is a matter of concern that it is not active most of the time. Dogs can live a maximum of 30 to 32 years if you donot believe it than ignore it and its 100% true. take good care of your dog and ask a vet to suggest what can be done for it.|`|oi66N5QYaa	My twelve year-old had stopped eating and had lost much movement in his hips.  He started losing weight, and became incontinent because of his hip degeneration. Then I knew it was his time.  I can't advise you on this one.  It's a difficult situation, to say the least.  Just watch your guy and if you believe he is suffering, look to your heart.|`|X4umNoGzaa	I hate to say this, because i'm sure you love your dog, and i know how i would feel in your shoes, however sounds like his quality of life isn't very good, and he has had a long life, I think you should have him put down, to save him any pain.|`|Fub9uEEvaa	Your dog may be miserable or it could still be just as a happy but i would say it is time for him!|`|23oJf8mjaa	The main question that I want to ask you is: is your baby in pain? If he is in constant pain I can't see him being happy. I had to put down my baby when she was only 6 years old and it was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.<br>  Before making any final decisions I would take your pup to at least 2 or 3 different veterinarians and get their opinion. Ask them if your baby is in constant pain. Ask if there is anything you can do for the pain. And go from there. They will advise you on what is best for your baby. Best wishes, and you and your pup are in my thoughts and prayers.

Some people say it's because of the weather, if he's an outdoor cat and he's went out for a long time then he'll sleep for a long time.

jV7SmnaTaa	labs are a good all around dog - otherwise, border collies can do really well too.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	I'm a little confused about your question. You're looking for a dog to be able to compete in Field Trials (Hunt Tests), Frisbee & Agility??? This piece of information makes a HUGE difference in the type of breeds to choose from.|`|2IOFXmQ2aa	Are you refering to field trials as in shepherding, or something else?  Please be more specific.<br>  <br>  You may want a lurcher or a high-spirited dog|`|Os6VjLH0aa	Most people like to use Border Collies, but, I have seen a lot of different breeds doing both of the events you mentioned. Standard poodles are really good at it, as are Goldens, whippets, Havanese, <br>  I have even seen a Basset Hound and an English Bulldog doing agility, they weren't very fast, but they seemed to love it.|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	"Field trials" are hunting trials.<br>  <br>  If you want to hunt as well as do agility, probably a field-bred Lab ot field-bred Golden. We have an excellent, fast Brittany in our agility classes that also hunts.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about agility only, and not hunting, there are many excellent breeds. Agility classes are split by jump heights, so large dogs do not compete with small dogs. Different breeds "rule" different jump heights. More than a specific breed, it is the "drive" (energy and desire to want to run the course) of the dog, the training ability of the handler, and the handling ability of the owner that makes for a "good team".  Surprisingly, some breeds that one would not think would excell in agility do: little Papillons, short legged Corgis. Generally, lighter framed, athletic looking dogs are "more agile" but there are always exceptions.<br>  <br>  I highly suggest you attend some agility trials in person. You will see what they are all about, what to expect, what it is you are wanting to do. Agility is not easy. It is great, great fun....but very training intensive and you have to RUN!  You will see many breeds there and this should help you make a choice. Watch the dogs, how they act outside the ring as well as in the ring. Talk to people, Find a local tariner. People can flippantly say Border Collies are great, but you have to remember you have to live with it! And BCs are very, very demanding and can drive you nuts. You will see their quirks, idiosyncisies and OCD behavior at a trial. You may see an Aussie will suit you better. Or you may fall in love with a Jack Russell, or an English Cocker. Or, if a non-AKC trial you will see several marvelous mixed breeds!<br>  <br>  look for local trials at following websites under "calendar of events" or such.<br>  <br>  www.akc.org<br>  www.k9cpe.com<br>  www.usdaa.com<br>  www.nadac.com<br>  <br>  Frisbee competitions: I will not play frisbee with my dogs. If you watch carefully, you will see the great stress put on their bodies. I know of several people whose dogs have broken down with excessive frisbee play: shoulder injuries, hip replacement that may not have been necessary if the dog was not pushed in frisbee competition.....|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	The term"field trial" can mean any number of performance events...restricted by BREED...dachs,basset, beagles,pointing breeds retriever breeds...on & on.<br>  <br>  WHICH "field trial"???<br>  <br>  Disc-dog is NOT a "field trial".<br>  Agility is NOT a "field trial" nor a "show".|`|3ckdLSWkaa	Border Collies are great at agility, but have a lot of energy<br>  Shelties, Aussies, and Labs are usually pretty good to.<br>  I dont know about field trials|`|S3w9utVEaa	Weimaraners are in my opinion and/or German Short Hair Pointers.

QVP8zSuWaa	If is clearly bothering him, try checking him in the sit position. Make sure you check in between the teeth and gums and the roof of his mouth. Having him drink some water and see if that clears it. If it continues today have him checked out <br>  It might just be bites. Check closely for any swelling in his mouth or neck, or other signs of pain, vomiting etc.<br>  He could have a reaction to the bites.|`|o4NarYVoaa	if its bothering him for more then 24-48 hours, bring him to the vet.  there may be a tumor or growth there that he can feel, that you arent seeing.|`|phzwr4QYaa	He might have a ant in his paw, not in his mouth. Look at his paw, is it red, swollen or do you see anything in it? Are his nails long?<br>  <br>  When dogs get items (bugs, splinters, dirt) in their paws they will put their paws in their mouth. Also if they have a food allergy, their paws will turn red and swollen and they will put their paws in their mouth. And if their nail are long they will do the same thing.<br>  <br>  Run your finger all around the inside of his mouth, under his tongue and in his lips. If you don't find anything, check his paws.|`|X4umNoGzaa	feel around the roof of his mouth to see if you can feel anything up there, if he is sticking his paw in his mouth there is something there irritating him, i suppose if there were ants could be one is stuck up there or bit him in his mouth|`|jPyh5GXWaa	It maybe serious just call a vet immediately. Maybe something is stuck in his neck. A vet can inspect it nicely and seek a solution for it than you can, isn't it.|`|HgMFrllLaa	Correct. When ant stings, sometimes the stingers get stuck in.<br>  Try to gently clean sweep his mouth with your finger.<br>  If this bothers your dog too much, he may end up tearing his mouth to pieces.|`|5023ee264f978013567158af6ecc93ffaa	Maybe he has a tooth ache.

It helps promote a healthy and strong muskuloskeletal system and helps build and maintain healthy joints, skin and coat.    Consult your vet about these, they can recommend a doseage amount and you can buy the supplements at walmart much cheaper than through a specialty pet supply store.

But if it were me I would get a male.|`|NBeQyTlMaa	Niether sex is superior over the other. Its all about the dogs personality. Just look for a puppy (preferably at a shelter) that seems like you bond with immediately. <br>  <br>  Make sure you get them neutered or spayed asap - usually at 4 months. This will keep male dogs from marking their territory as much, and keep female dogs from going into heat. Also, it may calm down the puppy some.|`|bokLLX36aa	Get a male. I have two dogs at home and have been around dogs my whole life and I have learned that normally the males are more caring. Surprising huh? I am 16 years old and my one dog is a male named buddy and the other a female named lilly. I have really noticed that buddy is way more chill than lilly and she is extremely jealous.

A lot of that is his thyroid so until the medicine kicks in and helps. Is he doing chemotherapy for the cancer?  Good luck, the best thing you can do is make sure he is getting all his nutrients and keep him happy and comfortable. Ask your vet what he thinks about the diet, they do have a N/D diet for cancer, your vet may or may not carry it.  It stands for Neoplasia diet, ask about it or google it.|`|LURQBU86aa	There are higher calorie foods out there for active dogs such as Solid Gold Barking at the Moon.

AMvR4u2Taa	Get her to the vet ASAP. My cat started throwing up a clear foamy liquid, we ignored it thinking it was nothing but a week later we noticed he had lost weight. After putting him on the scale we found out he had went from 18 pounds to 14 pounds in only 7 days. After taking him to the vet we learned that he had been eating my pony tail holders and they were stuck in his stomach. We walked out with our cat and a $1,500 vet bill a week later.

7Arb7rRTaa	The first thing to do is buy a ferret from a pet store (cost 125.00 to185.00)<br>  Make sure the ferret is descented and fixed. the reason why is because if u get a female the first time it comes into season and it is not bred it will die. (Breeding ferrets r complicated) Marshall ferrets are good ferrets to buy and they have a one year warranty. Stuff u need to buy=ferrets love hammocks to sleep in,  litter boxes, food dish, water dish or water bottle,FERRET FOOD no cat food. They love to play with cat toys, rolled up socks, hot wheels cars,paper bags. Ferrets need to have shots canine distemper and feline rabies. Call the vets around ur area and make sure they will see a ferret.  Also buy a ferrets for dummies book. try half.com they are usually really cheap.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	Ferrets are fun! They can learn tricks and be walked on a leash. Whether they live alone or in a large group, they remain very playful and active for most of their lives, which usually last 6 to 10 years.<br>  <br>  # Ferrets typically cost about $100. Consider adopting one from a shelter instead of buying one at a pet store. Whatever option you choose, make sure the ferret is at least 8 weeks old.<br>  <br>  # Ferrets can be tough to take care of. They are not rodents and require more maintenance than other animals their size, such as guinea pigs or hamsters. They also are more frisky than many other pets. Getting a ferret as a child's first pet may not be a good idea.<br>  <br>  # However, they can be too smart and curious at times. Ferrets are known to burrow into places where they shouldn't be, such as cabinets, drawers, cracks, and even toilets.<br>  <br>  It is absolutely necessary to ferret-proof your home. Do not give your ferret the run of the house. Keep him in his cage or in one ferret-proofed room where he will be safe without supervision. If you give him more space, crawl around your house and check for any cracks larger than a square inch, then seal them. Ferrets are also good jumpers and climbers, so make sure that fragile items are out of reach. They also enjoy digging in carpets and soil. Protect your floors and keep ferrets away from plants to avoid a mess.<br>  <br>  # Ferrets usually get along with cats and dogs. They need proper instruction and be patient if your pets aren't chummy at first. Make sure that they get used to each other's scents and have supervised visits before they are allowed to interact freely. Ferrets generally don't like smaller animals, such as rodents, birds and lizards. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule.<br>  <br>  # Ferrets, especially males, have a distinctive odor. Much of the odor can be eliminated by neutering your pet and by changing his bedding often. Nevertheless, be sure that the smell does not bother you or anyone in your household.<br>  <br>  Like skunks, ferrets have scent glands that release very strong odors when they are stressed, amorous or frightened. Even surgically de-scenting a ferret, or removing these scent glands, will not get rid of the day-to-day scent that is normally released through the skin.<br>  <br>  Also be sure to handle several ferrets before deciding to buy one to determine whether you are allergic to them. An allergy to cats or dogs does not determine an allergic reaction to ferrets.<br>  <br>  # Ferrets are illegal in some areas. Some of the larger ferret-free zones, or FFZ's, include Washington, D.C., Dallas, Texas, and all of California and Hawaii. Other areas, such as New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Illinois, require permits. This is only a partial list; towns may have their own ferret laws. Check the regulations in your area by calling humane societies, veterinarians, or the local Wildlife Department and Fish and Game Department. If you rent your home, be sure to get your landlord's permission to keep the ferret.<br>  <br>  # Your ferret must be neutered or spayed. Males who are not neutered are extremely aggressive and mark their territory with a smelly fluid. Females in heat must breed or they will develop anemia. Breeding ferrets is very complicated and risky, and should not be an option at this point.<br>  <br>  # Ferrets require vaccinations. The rabies vaccine requires annual booster shots, so be prepared to pay for them. Ask your vet about additional vaccines that your ferret may need.<br>  <br>  # Ferrets are okay with cold. Ferrets are generally comfortable in chilly climates, and some even like to play in the snow! However, they do not handle heat very well. Temperatures in the 80's or higher may be fatal, so if you plan to get a ferret, make sure you keep his cage cool in the summer.|`|M6uIbKXRaa	i just got all the stuff for my ferret with the ferret ur probably looking at around 250  dollars for everything|`|tGmwqtr5aa	Ferrets cost about 100 dollers|`|AA11570236	I have a good rule if it's wild don't buy it.Nothing but trouble,fleas,ticks,diseases,borrow into furniture,they stink,(have musk glands,they bite.Trust me don't get one.|`|iuYtcX6Xaa	if you are buying from a petstore , you are looking at hundreds of dollars, you can adopt form a shelter and the adoption fee is usually 50 (they are about 130 at a pet store) and look on craigslist for a cage because they are also over a hundred at a PS, sometime you can find both a ferret and a cage for pretty cheap on craigslist.
614tYbzxaa	The reason is not fully known. A leg is tucked underneath the body, because the flamingo like some other animals has the ability to have half its body go into a state of sleep , and when one side is rested, the flamingo will swap leg and let the other half sleep but this has not been proven. It is often suggested this is done in part to keep the legs from getting wet, in addition to conserving energy|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	So they can sleep.

I will try do better for you.  The following is the results of a study by Discovery.     While some of the mystery still remains, people who study flamingos have given us many possible reasons why the birds stand on one leg. First, it allows the raised leg and foot to dry. When you are in the bathtub for a long time, your skin starts to "prune up" and wrinkle. The same thing can happen to the webbed feet of the flamingo. By changing which leg they stand on, flamingos can allow their feet and legs to dry. Second, standing on one leg helps them hunt their food better because their shadow looks more like a tree when they stand on one foot. You don’t see too many trees with two long trunks, do you?<br>  <br>  But probably the most important reason flamingos stand on one leg is to conserve body heat and energy. A bird’s leg receives three times as much blood per heartbeat as their major muscles do, and that blood provides a great deal of warmth to the animal. Flamingos have very long legs, which provide a great deal of surface area for the loss of heat. If you are outside when it is very cold and all you have on is a short-sleeve T-shirt, what do you do with your arms to keep them warm? Most of the time you tuck them in your shirt, close to your body. That is exactly what the flamingo does. By tucking one leg in close to its body, the flamingo is able to stay warmer in cooler weather.|`|kUtvRGMPaa	us humans can stand on 2 legs for long periods ov time either, try it....or watch someone else, they always relax one leg, its just that they do it a certain way to make it obvious. i think its due to the centre ov gravity and balance x|`|GvQpSSNFaa	they are actually resting one side of their body.they have the ability to shut down[slow down] the blood flow to the side they are resting and can sleep whilst doing this|`|U02Ku6jpaa	when they sleep only half of them sleeps so the leg they have up is asleep.This is true even though it sounds daft|`|LqDpYN3Taa	cos i broke the other one

tShDXmgbaa	Livebearers breed on their own without you having to do anything special. The only thing you do is try your best to give the fry lots of hiding space when then are born.  If you are not able to save any of the fry...I would hold off on more livebearers.  The best way to save fry is remove the mom to a birthing tank. The next best thing is to provide lots of hiding places for fry to hide out.
veDvtYhJaa	Your dog doesn't have to look like a poodle to have poodle in him.  Also, groomers are better than the general public at recognizing breed looks and breed traits.  There's really only one way to be sure... DNA testing. <br>  <br>  If she's ACA registered, then you should be able to get information on her parents from them.  ACA is a registry created so dogs can enter their competitions.  Some of those dogs are AKC registered, or otherwise.  The ACA is a health tracking registry also. <br>  <br>  I'll give you some links to follow to learn more. -!-|`|cnZlMojUaa	Honestly, he could be either. As you are hearing the ACA registry is not held in high regard. Your dog's mother could be a yorkie and she may have been bred to a yorkie, but if the breeder had other dogs, the mother may have mated with a poodle as well. Her litter could then be a combination of pure yorkies and yorkie x poodle pups. If the breeder was not careful, this could happen. If the breeder didn't witness the poodle breeding (and sometimes even if he/she did) would list the litter as yorkie mother and yorkie father. Also, if she was breeding poorly bred yorkies, your dog can be a yorkie, but not follow breed conformation standards. I was at PetSmart this week and met a lady with what she called a "monster yorkie". The dog was larger than my Scottie. She said he had papers and laughed. She said he weighed 25 pounds and was a sweet dog. She adored him, but he looked like a mix as well.|`|3giaPYe8aa	ACA is a crap registry.  Who knows if it's purebred or not.  Just take good care of your dog no matter what it is.  Ya know, ACA would probably register a Chia Pet!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	ACA is a crap registry so its highly likely that your dog is a MIX. not yorkie poo thats not a breed name and frankly i find that vulgar, who in their right minds would want to own a dog thats "designer" name makes it sound like its a piece of s***, yorkie x poodle MIX is the true name. Mixes have no standard look because thats what they are mixes, mutts, mongrels.<br>  <br>  ACA, CKC (continental), ACR, APRI are all crap registrys. The papers for those dogs are worth nothing. Because every single last one of those registries register anything as a dog, i have heard of people who have turtles registered as purebred dogs by the CKC. All they care about is money.<br>  <br>  Most of the people who register with these registries are AKC rejects for good reasons.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	A Yorkie is a purebred if its father was a Yorkie and its mother was a Yorkie (who are Yorkies because their mothers and fathers were Yorkies), not because it is registered. Mixed breeds are registered as pure all the time. If the pup's source is of questionable integrity you can have a dna test done to determine if the dog is mixed or not.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Since the ACA is only used by BYB and puppy mills that can't register with the AKC or other reliable kennel clubs there is a good chance it is not.  ACA and other "kennel clubs" of that ilk will register anything as a purebred dog as long as someone is willing to pay for it.     It is possible that your dog is just so poorly bred that it does not look like it is suppose to which is not uncommon with BYB but the majority of breeders that register ACA and other similar kennel clubs do so because the dogs they are breeding from are not really purebred or because they have lost their registration privileges with the AKC for failing to keep proper records or falsifying registration papers.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	Maybe....Maybe not.|`|s76aC4G8aa	Hard to give you an answer without seeing a photograph.<br>  <br>  And what is ACA registered?  I've heard of AKC, CKC but never ACA, what type of registration is that?  If he's not AKC or even CKC he might not be a purebred Yorkie.  Was he advertised as one?  Did you see the mother or even the father?  On his papers what breed are his parents listed as?  Do they both say Yorkshire Terrier?  I have CKC papers on my dog and both her parents are listed as Weimaraner so that makes her a Weimaraner, unless they are both purebred Yorkies it might be questonable as to what exactly your dog is.<br>  <br>  Post a photo and we'll be able to tell you.|`|XagPxe7Faa	Any dog can be something other than what the breeder claims it to be...regardless of registry.  (Likewise there are responsible breeders using them too.)  There are scandelous breeders using every registry these days.  If you have questions, I would contact the breeder.  If you challenge it, they will have to have the parents of your dog DNA'd and matched to your little one.  Of course, this will only tell you who the parents are, not if he is purebred, but if on of the parents IS a poodle....<br>  <br>  Hmm...the poster has questions as to if her dog is purebred, and the responses she gets are "your registry is crap."  That may be true, and in my opinion it is, but how does that address the issue she is needing help with and asking about?|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	ACA is a worthless registry and will register crossbreeds and dogs without proper pedigrees.

zpwJR60baa	I had the same experience like yours, It is really hard for an older cat and a younger one to get along.  Younger one have the energy, and the older one (how old) just want to be left alone. <br>  What did I do?<br>  <br>  I got another younger kitten about 2 months, and when this happen, the other male cat left the female one alone.  As he got a playmate now, and the 2 months old taken the older cat as his mom.  The female one was at that time 18 yrs old. <br>  <br>  I am a cat behaviorist, and I had aways told people at the shelter when they adopt is too get a second cat the same age as their other cat due to their energy level.  If you can not afford a third cat, I suggest several play time with the male cat, to get rig of his energy daily. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Your problem possibly stems from the way you introduced both the cats to each other.  Did you just bring the male home and put it together with your female cat or did you do very gradual introductions/scent exchanging?<br>  <br>  You might be able to take a step backwards and try to introduce them properly by doing some scent exchanging now.  Take a clean cloth and wipe it around the face of your younger cat (where his scent glands are) and then wipe the same cloth around the face of your other cat and vice versa - the reason for doing this is that cats recognise SCENT before SIGHT and if they recognise the smell of each other and accept it as familiar then they are less likely to fight.  Keep doing this for a few days and when you see them together and they are not fighting, give them something tasty to eat such as some bits of chicken so that they associate being together as a good thing.<br>  <br>  They must have their own litter facilities (2 cats should have 3 litter trays) and separate feeding stations.  You should also try Feliway Artificial Pheromone Diffuers which you should plug in around your house (particularly in the areas where your cats are likely to meet) and they will calm and reassure the cats.|`|wXyoo8mNaa	cat nip lots of it!

XurYYreBaa	Your girls are still getting accustomed to you & really haven't been with you very long.  Every rat has a unique personality, just like the rest of us, & some adjust to a new home more quickly than others.<br>  The dumbo may be more nervous b/c she is older, or she may simply have a more skittish personality but I wouldn't worry about her *not* adjusting.  The fear-pooping should stop in another week or 2 if you keep giving her lots of attention.  Also, she's got a good role model in the younger rat, whose friendliness toward sets a good example.  We've lived with rats who have learned quite a bit from observing each other.<br>  If Miss Dumbo won't take a treat while you're hoding her, give her one @ the end of the play session.  Several of our rats, no matter how friendly, aren't really interested in eating while they're being held.|`|FoeyqAZqaa	I would suggest setting up a little room where you can interact with both the rats on their terms. Let them come to you and play with you when they want. It may help the one learn to trust you.|`|3MxSepRdaa	I've had several rats over the years and each one has their own little personlaities. I had one who never liked to be petted, held and wouldn't eat unless she was in her cage. But she would lay next to me and cuddle, clean herself and sleep. <br>  <br>  You have to let them be themselves, and if one doesn't act like the rest be ok with that. Right now I have a 3 year old male rat that still will poo on me. He climbs onme and leaves a little poo present and then jumps off and lays down on the other side of the couch. <br>  <br>  Make sure they have plenty to do while they are out, toys are always fun and if he never wants to be held and is skittish that may just be his personality.
AA12083992	No,no,no,no over the counter crap. That stuff does not work and often harms the pet!<br>  Bite the bullet and take the poor dog to a vet. They can treat both problems. You have to find out with what to treat your house, furniture, yard everyplace the dog goes. Every where she goes she is dropping flea eggs to hatch later and re-infest her. You have to get rid of it all. It is an ongoing process.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	You might want to change from frontline toAdvantix use it a month or two then go to another brand of flea medication. It seem to confuse the fleas for what ever reason and they have a hard time getting immune to the medication.  Also there is a med called Capstar, fleas are gone within 30 min off the dog( so help me it's true) We use it in the grooming shop instead of dip( a severe bio-hazzard to pet and everyone else). It is expensive though about $5 a tab and is only effective for 24 hrs.  But have found that if you can afford to give it daily for 30 days it apparently kills any other invaders over that time and the population in the environment is gone.( fleas spend only about 10% of the time on the animal the other 90% in the environment) You have to realize that everytime your dog goes out he is exposed and everytime you go out you can also bring them in from outside. A safe non chemical dust called diatomaceous earth can help also.  If you get food quality you can apply it directly to the dog as a powder, it dessicates fleas.<br>  For the tapes Droncit is effective|`|6xphiZLSaa	I work at Petsmart as a groomer. What we do for most customers sounds like your best bet. First I would tell you to take your dog to the vet to get the appropriate tapeworm medicine and treat that cause you never know if the over the counter stuff will work. You can even call you vet to just ask questions and see what they refer to you. Second as far as the fleas what we do with customers is we have there dog come in we do a flea bath and apply the flea drops we use zodiac which is way cheaper then frontline and it works while the dog is in the salon we have the client bomb there house and clean up to make sure all the fleas are gone. Do not use any Hartz products that all I have to say. Hope that helps|`|HgMFrllLaa	Perhaps it's time to get serious and take the dog to the bleeding VET?<br>  (unless you wanna harvest the tapeworm and sell them to the over weight females, of course)|`|bDsIgFoXaa	Go to your vet!!! he will give you something for the tapeworm and for the fleas. you might have them in your house so if it gets bad call an exterminator he will be able to tell you if you have them.|`|qapJU3tMaa	You talk to your vet.

f1lpdiNEaa	To give you a general idea, it might vary practice to practice though...<br>  Daily hoovering and cleaning of all floors.<br>  Morning and evening cleaning of kennels (and as required during day).<br>  Cleaning of all consulting rooms - tables, scales, cupboards, doors after each session of appointments (morning, afternoon and evening).<br>  Cleaning of theatre and prep rooms before procedures start, in between each operation or examination and a last thorough clean at the end of the day.<br>  Daily sterilising of used instruments in the autoclave.<br>  Wipe down of reception area and chairs. Mopping accidents as required.<br>  Wash hands in between handling animals with something like Hibiscrub. Use gloves if needed especially when dealing with blood, urine and faeces and exotic species. <br>  <br>  Cleaning obviously involves using disinfectant, usually with paper towel so it can be thrown away when finished. Anything that has come into contract with blood, muscous, urine or faeces goes into clinical waste, anything else in household waste. Clinical waste is taken away for incineration. Usually a nurse will be assigned to assist with operations and s/he should avoid cleaning up after any dirty procedures during the day to help minimise contaminiating a surgically clean area. Hope that is what you meant and it helps!|`|vwC7klVVaa	You best bet is to contact your local vet and explain your are doing a course work and ask what there routine is.  When i was a veterinary nusrse the vets was cleaned twice a day. In the morning the floors were hoovered and washed and all surfaces were washed in the after noon this was done again but also the walls were  cleaned and all he cages were cleaned after the animals that were in that day had gone home. During the day the tables used were cleaned after every animal and all equipment was sterilized after every use. At a vet it is a consent job  of cleaning.|`|BTg2qV2Baa	First, wash your hands after handling any animal!! Any fluids, feaces left by an animal must!! be cleaned up asap. The consult room must be wiped over by the nurse in between consults. after surgery, once the animal has been removed to recovery, the surgery must! be cleaned and sterilised immediately. This means cleaning all surfaces with a disinfectant that  is used by the practice, vacuuming and mopping the floor. Once all is cleaned, then the door to surgery should be closed so as not to have other agents creep into the surgery. Then the next day. before surgery, you should go over the surgery again, to make sure the room is clean! That's when you check the ana is functionall and sterilised equipment is ready
k6flESfNaa	wow. really? ok "breeder", im 16 and know you need to take her temp constantly and if it falls below 100 its a pretty good indicator that pups will be on the way in about 12 hours.<br>  <br>  <br>  as for the milking, dont go by that, some bitches produce milk during or AFTER the birth.|`|PM23RDycaa	From looking at your past questions I totally believe you are full of it. So would this be the dog that was 8 month when you got her 4 months ago and had no clue what was wrong with her OR  the female you asked about last night who hasn't even had her AKC registration done and filled out.<br>  <br>  A PROFESSIONAL wouldn't be on here of all places asking random strangers. You'd be talking to your mentor, vet or other breeders.<br>  <br>  A PROFESSIONAL would not be checking her dogs nipples and causing her dog pain since you would know milk doesn't always come in BEFORE whelping.<br>  <br>  A PROFESSIONAL would know to be tracking their female's temp.<br>  <br>  A PROFESSIONAL would not its not uncommon for a ***** to nest early.<br>  <br>  Doesn't matter if this is your first litter with her. Go talk to your vet or breed mentor.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Well, since you have bred before, surely you would know to take her temperature and watch for the drop in it.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	If you, who are supposedly experienced and can actually see and examine the b*tch in question can't tell, then how are a bunch of random strangers on the internet going to know?<br>  <br>  Ask your VET!|`|v53LgfsWaa	Take her temperature.  When it drops to 97 or below she is within 12 hours of giving birth.  Also your dogs behavior might change just the slightest like always wanting to be with you.|`|b807f13da6719d3e3a726d7eb53fb59daa	Your pet sounds as though she is expecting a large litter.If so,she could possibly go into labor at 56 days from conception.I've seen dogs that are pregnant and had no milk elimination until pups are born.I would say in my experience that your pet could go into labor anytime.Give her some baby non-flavored pediolyte for the neausea and remove her drinking water.The pediolyte will settle her stomach.When beginning labor some dogs won't eat and try to find a safe place to hide.Keep an eye on her.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	WTF are you doing "squeezing" ANYTHING????<br>  <br>  How could you possibly have had ANY experience & still be so completely ignorant????<br>  <br>  Don't you have a friggin' THERMOMETER??

MstjbpVJaa	Hi Slugsiss,Wacky here!!<br>  Well it has happened quicker than we thought.<br>  The eggs will hatch in 21 days from the last one laid or if you count from the first one depending on how many she lays.could be 25,it all depends how many, eggs there are.<br>  The nesting material is normal,remember what I said try not to disturb her wait a few more days to look and see how many eggs she has laid then leave them to it.<br>  Get soaking some seed ,if you can get any Dandelion leaves give them a few ,make sure you wash them first,don't give them Lettuce,<br>  <br>  Once again Good Luck for a successful hatching.but remember first rounds are some times clear,check the eggs at about 12-14 days,if they have changed to a dirty grey then there is a good chance of them been fertile.<br>  <br>  Hi again .feed the soaked seed from now till the young are feeding them selves on it,I bet you are over the moon .|`|rQlzfHqraa	Sure. Many birds continue to add to the nest even after they start laying eggs or setting. I've seem the male bring material to the female while she is sitting on eggs.|`|kFlMHSKIaa	You could fry them.
mxvoOjc4aa	i own/owned both a dutch warmblood and a hanoverian (both geldings), and have had many successes in the hunter world with both.  TBs tend to not have the great conformation necessary for the hunter ring, and can be too fast at times.  however, every breed has an upside and a downside, but i firmly believe that dutch warmbloods and hanoverians are by far the best breeds for hunter riding.  happy showing!|`|RI23G0Awaa	thoroughnreds are best for anything apart from the shetland grand national!  hope this helps:)|`|tWuMG7Mkaa	So i would say that it really all depends on the individual horse. However, warmbloods are VERY "in style" right now. I have a belgian warmblood mare who i LOVE! and she's very versatile.....i compete primarily in equitation and jumpers with her...but i have done some hunters and she usually places in the top ribbons. having said that, i also had a thoroughbred who is probably the best horse i will ever have. He was game for everything and tried his heart out. So thoroughbreds are always safe choices because they are EXTREMELY athletic and generally have minimal soundness issues. good luck finding a horse! also, i just posted a question about whether i should quit track and field to only horseback ridde. If you could answer that it would be amazing because i can't make a decision!|`|pnDZcQKpaa	holsteiner is more of a strong, dressage type horse. selle francais are definetly one of the best for jumpers. hanoverians are also dressage horses. dutch warmbloods are good equitation horsers, because they have a nice, long stride and can jump very smoothely with a lot of flair. <br>  for hunters, thoroughbreds or selle francais would be the best. thoroughbreds have a good pace, and they generally have tight knees. selle francais can clear most jumps, and if they are trained properly, can be an equitation, hunter, or jumpers horse.|`|6DCQsdyuaa	welsh pony<br>  throughbred<br>  olderburg<br>  halflinger<br>  selle francais<br>  holsteiner<br>  hanoverian<br>  arabian's can also make good jumpers sometimes. People always 4get about them.|`|7Cis2pJEaa	Contrary to what some may say, I actually think a Quarter Horse is the best all around breed. I ride at an english/hunter barn, and most of the 30+ horses are QH. A few of the more athletic jumpers are QH/TB crosses. We also have a few draft crosses (3 PMU geldings) that are shaping up to be great mounts. They are all under 5yrs old, but really coming along well. Its all personal opinion. I prefer a heavier, shorter mount. Other people like the tall leggy variety. <br>  The most popular would be the TB and its crosses. Another thing to consider is that certain breeds are more popular in different countries. Warmbloods who are calm and dependable do make good eq and hunters, so many people do prefer them.|`|dcOJQYRJaa	I personally love Appendix QHs. The cross between a TB stallion and a QH mare creates a long, leggy horse that still has a strong column of bone and that laid-back, up-for-anything demeanor. I LOVE appendixes. Warmbloods are amazing as well but I think that Appendixes are more readily available for a lesser price. Plus I'm partial to anything with QH in it. :]|`|eq9kJZ4Uaa	thoroughbreds use to be the "in" breed for many disciplines like hunters and jumpers.  However, recently dutch warmbloods have become more popular.  Hanoverians and german warmbloods (such as a sachen) are also good breeds as well.  the best would depend on the individual horse.|`|0j6btyZDaa	I believe Thoroughbreds are best for any english discipline and Quarter Horses for any western.<br>  <br>  (sorry 4 spelling, my brian died =P)
vMByDy1raa	Really they probably don't poop any more than any other bird. The bigger a bird is the more they poop and geese hang out in big groups so it really make a big mess.  A little bird poops every 15 to 20 minutes so geese probably do too.  A little bird weight 3 oz. while geese can probably weight up 3 to 5 lb.|`|rQlzfHqraa	Geese are grazers and eat a lot of grasses to sustain life therefore they poop a lot of wastes. Watch where you step!|`|JLmh4Ctkaa	BECUASE THEY HAVE NO BUTT MUSCLES AND THEY JUST DO.|`|Jq2K3N1Zaa	Because they eat all the time.|`|mLabzxnIaa	why do you want to know?????|`|FoeyqAZqaa	Because they do, why do you want to know?|`|1oj4aamaaa	They listen to conservative talk radio.

AA12322387	That completely depends if you already have a facility or will have to build one.  Disease control is of utmost importance with animal shelters.  Cages and kennels must be of proper materials.  Many times you have to have special sewage/septic/drains because of the waste.<br>  <br>  To build a facility you are looking at at least a few hundred thousand dollars.  Our local humane society had plans drawn up for a decent facility and it was around $600,000.<br>  <br>  We are now fortunate enough to lease a space that a former vet used.  The facility is not ideal though and because we are leasing it, we don't want to invest a lot of money in it.<br>  <br>  And to rescue nearly all animals as you said...you need some major funds for vet bills.  That also depends on where you live.  About 300 dogs are euthanized at my local animal control monthly.  We can only rescue a handful due to the overwhelming number.<br>  <br>  Our vet bills run anywhere from $6,500 to over 10,000 every month.  Many are sick when they come to us...heartworms, parvo, cherry eye, mange, ect.  They are spayed and nuetered.  <br>  <br>  Rescue isn't cheap.  And while I would like to save them all, it is impossible.  Until pet owners learn how to be responsible pet owners and get their animals fixed, we will never get this problem under control.<br>  <br>  It's very difficult for rescues to survive.  Most depend on volunteers and donations from the community.  As soon as you get your local government involved, you end up being a kill facility so you have to be careful.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your project.  You need lotsa money..so look for a building to lease or one to purchase that is already set up for what you need.|`|AA11085356	I'm sure you would have to expect to pay out quite a lot, probably in the thousands... You would need proper shelter for the different types of animals, plus food, bedding, perhaps medication. And you would probably have to take some of them to the vet for treatments. You would need to kno how to rehabilitate them (or hire someone) to be able to set them up for adoption.<br>  <br>  I would definitely do a lot of research before you put too much money and effort into this. Maybe there is a local rescue center you could visit or even work for for a while to see what all they do.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|xx2TtoZsaa	A lot of money. There is so much that you have to do in order to open an Animal Shelter.<br>  <br>  If you get the building and pass all the tests... You can talk to local pet supply stores and if you advertise for them... they may help you out with food and other things you will need.<br>  <br>  Kind of like sponsors.|`|RvddYKqjaa	If you are taking a business class, you are the person we would go to to ask that question. :-)<br>  The costs would be astronomical.|`|BTg2qV2Baa	It would cost a lot. You would have to consider the different types of housing, the variation of foods needed, the different types of care required for each species. Dogs are different to cats, who are different to ferrets, who are different to chickens. Native animals require special needs, they cannot be just chucked into a cage. You would have to look into all the types of animals you were going to rescue and go from there.|`|dZxD58cWaa	Well considering all of the abused and neglected children in this country and the horrific lack of concern or resources to help them, I would say it probably would be easy for you to get help for the animals. All of that funding has got to be sitting somewhere!|`|FoeyqAZqaa	More money then you probably have.|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	You would need donations because its not a model that would make any money|`|f9sL3WgQaa	between housing, property, taxes, vet fee's, food, water, cleaning up, license and fee's for what usually will end up being what...1,000 or so pets at one time..because thats pretty much how big our rescue center is...we are talking half a million.<br>  <br>  Don't forget the lawyers and people who will be sueing you for the animals not having enough attention, cleanliness and so on...just because they are animal rights activist.
vwC7klVVaa	I am affarid it is but now thanks to a programme made by the BBC1 the kennel club have given into public pressure and are going to stop registering inbreed pupppies. So hopefully this cruel practice will stop.|`|AA10283080	Just like anything in the world it is done by people who know what they're doing and people who don't know what they're doing.<br>  <br>  But even for people who know what they're doing it doesn't always turn out with a positive result....nothing is 100% positive.|`|3giaPYe8aa	No, it is not a regular occurrence.  Although sometimes it is done, it is only done by very knowledgeable people who really know about genetics and are breeding very, very carefully for certain very good traits or for cleared genetic health issues.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Yes it does happen but not often, when done by someone who has been in the breed for 40+ years, the significant risks are limited. People who should do inbreeding are the people who have actually done research on genetics and actually know the risks but can control them. Personally i would not do mother to son, or father to daughter, but cousin to cousin yes.<br>  <br>  The problems you hear are from people who have no clue about breeding or health testing.<br>  <br>  Line breeding and In breeding are two different things, go look it up and see.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Happens all the time, especially by back yard breeders who just want some puppies to sell and don't know, or care, about genetics.<br>  So called "responsible" breeders will do it too to get a particularly desirable trait transferred to the puppies (they hope, just as likely to transfer a random undesirable gene),<br>  and puppy millers don't give a damn what they do so long as they get "livestock".<br>  <br>  There are no laws about dogs other than that they are property - sad, but the way it is.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	It is NOT common.  After nearly 30 years in dogs I can count on my fingers the number of pedigrees I've seen with such breedings - from good breeders, at least.<br>  <br>  But it is done occasionally.  If the breeders is knowledgable then it can be a good way to solidify traits in a line, and to pinpoint the location of genetic diseases so that they can be eliminated.<br>  <br>  Done by amateurs, the results can be disastrous.|`|AA10029366	A regular occurrence? No.<br>  <br>  But it is occasionally done by breeders who know what they are doing, have thoroughly researched the pedigree, and are willing to deal with negative consequences.<br>  <br>  More information:<br>  <a href="http://bowlingsite.mcf.com/Genetics/Inbreeding.html" rel="nofollow">http://bowlingsite.mcf.com/Genetics/Inbr...</a>|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	Not regularly, no, but it is done - as others have said - sometimes by reputable, knowledgeable breeders, sometimes by the ignorant and (probably most commonly) as a mistake mating where the breeder owns both dogs.<br>  The best ***** I ever owned was from a father/daughter mating. <br>  Dogs from such close matings can no longer be registered with Kennel Club.<br>  Inbreeding & line breeding is not only carried out in dogs, it has been an accepted part of most breeding programmes in domestic animals - everything from pigs to horses.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Occasionally..<br>  <br>  Reputable breeders rarely do this..  only if they have years of experience and are fully knowledgeable about genetics, the pedigree, and have done genetic health testing on their dogs for several generations.  Most reputable breeders will not do such a tight inbreeding.  Inbreeding doesnt always mean problems.. if someone knows what they are doing, it can be a useful tool to breed away from health problems, and to strengthen desired traits.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  With back yard breeders and puppy millers.. its not uncommon for them to do this..  with back yard breeders, its often an "oops" thing, and not planned.  Millers just dont care what dog breeds to what... they will flasify paperwork anyways.  The problem with this is that the breeders have no idea what they are doing, there is an increased risk of health problems.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Responsible breeders do Line breed but the breeding above would be a no no. Line breeding takes extensive knowledge on the part of the breeder of genetics. They also must have good knowledge of their individual breed  as well as the traits, both good and bad in other lines of that breed.. What traits are malleable enough to be affected by the practice and the Standard<br>  ( see AKC.ORG for specific breed standards) they are trying to achieve.  A standard is a description of what the "perfect specimen" of a particular breed should look like. Line breeding can be better expressed as an educated type of genetic engineering. <br>  Line breeding should NEVER be attempted by the un-knowledgable. It is tough to do and do well. The link below might better help you to understand this method.|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	I personally don't know of any breeders who inbreed their dogs but i guess it wouldn't surprise me at all if there were some, some people are just that desperate sad to say.

UdTFJuPpaa	It is normal for a female cat to have their first heat any time from 6 to 18 months. It partly depends on what months she is born in and first heat can be delayed by winter, as has probably happened with your girl.<br>  <br>  Don't worry. Wait and she should start soon. Make sure she is well fed and switch back to kitten food if you think she feels slim as females need a certain level of body fat to be able to call.<br>  <br>  Do join the Bengal Cat Club and the Novice Breeders Advice Club and you will have plenty of help, support and mentoring to help you make sure all goes well with your girl.|`|x3RBy8Ljaa	I have a bengal that didn't come into heat until 3 days before she turned a year old.  Also,  her heat was so light,  anyone could have missed it.   Good luck|`|bmaYJ9h6aa	Hi,<br>  Bengals can be notoriously hard to breed.. <br>  My first two Bengal girls didn't actually have litters until they were almost two years old and then we had one cat reject the kittens the other ate them ..  Put it down to the wild blood in them one was a F4 the other a F5.<br>  However in answer to your question .. No I don't know of any fertility test that can be preformed on a cat.<br>  Every cat is different and some females will mature later than others. From my experience I would say that Bengals fall into the late developer  bracket.. So ther might not be anything at all wrong with your female .. you just need to give her time.<br>  <br>  You could also have a silent caller.. very difficult to  detect when they are in season. They just become a little extra friendly . heat cycles can also be delayed by the weather/ seasons.. you will find that during the winter .. short / cold days .. cats will be less likely to go on heat.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why not take her along to the vet and have a good chat with him / her.|`|DtkLsetkaa	How much experience do you have breeding?  Unless you are experienced and are only doing it for the betterment of the breed, and are 100% prepared to care for ALL those kittens, just in case you can't find homes, then please get her spayed.  If you are doing it to make money, that's shameful, i hope that is not the case.<br>  <br>  If you want experience, this is not the place to start.  Apprentice/assist with a local breeder (it doesn't have to be bengals but an exotic breed would be a good place to start) and learn exactly what the care is like, how much money is needed, all that sort of stuff.  Don't just start breeding to learn about it.  And yes, the vet can test for infertility, although I don't know whats involved, because all my cats are fixed and I have no desire whatsoever to have oodles of kittens running around my house.|`|hetZz4c1aa	Before you even consider breeding, you'll need a mentor.

iIGOi2Idaa	I take it your cat isn't spayed. This situation is a good example of why even indoor cats MUST still be spayed by six months of age.<br>  <br>  Odds are if the male wasn't neutered, he will have mated your cat. ('slept with'?!). However, females will usually come out of season after they've been mated, and it sounds as if she is currently in season, so perhaps they haven't done the deed yet, if you're lucky.<br>  <br>  You will not be able to tell if she's pregnant until she's about mid-term (they're pregnant for 2 months); that is, until her belly starts to get a  big bigger. A vet should be able to tell a little before then by palpation, or confirm with xray/ultrasound.<br>  <br>  I strongly advise booking her in to be spayed asap. If she isn't pregnant, you may have just avoided an unfortunate situation. If she is pregnant; it can still be avoided; vets will cerainly spay pregnant cats.<br>  <br>  Please don't let her have kittens; there are too many in the world already, if you take up more homes with these kittens, that will be less homes available for the ones in shelters.<br>  <br>  Indoor-only cats should still be spayed, not only because of the likelihood of 'accidents' like this, but also to prevent mammary cancer and pyometra.<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|VkXQq2y2aa	You won't be able to tell for a few weeks. her nipples will start getting bigger and pinker.|`|LyADYtHQaa	so you cat is still acting like she is in heat? well if so then she shouldnt be prego.  my cat got hit up by one of my lil male cats and she wasnt in heat for very long and after a few days she wasnt in heat anymore which means she is most likely prego. after they have been fertilized then they dont continue to be in heat anymore. it takes a while for them to get big if they are pregnant and if she is still meowing and stickin her butt in the air and stuff then i dont think she is pregnant. if you need any other info later on then just let me kno. my email is supermanluver86@comcast.net|`|kpJws6kEaa	You know when your cats is pregnant she gets fat, but since its only been 3 days that she acts this way then you cant really tell, so in my opinion you should wait a little longer or you can just take it to the vet to find out whether or not shes pregnant.|`|w9aR8ymGaa	Wow that is a rough situation!

dcOJQYRJaa	We use this kind of drag and it works so I can give you an accurate account here... <br>  Go to your local farm store and purchase a cattle panel (the forty-eight-inch welded wire fence section seen here: <a href="http://www.ruralking.com/cattle-panel.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ruralking.com/cattle-panel.ht...</a><br>  If the panel is sixteen feet long, cut in into two eight-foot sections. Hook them together using clips or bolts short-ways so the panel is now 8'x8'. Make sure the long wires are going horizontal. You can drag this behind an ATV, tractor, lawn mower or small truck through the pasture. It works very well in the months where the grass is short or in dry lots. We use it to even out the muddy paddock before it freezes so it's not so pocked after it freezes. <br>  <br>  For the summer when the grass is long, you can make simple alterations to this drag to accomplish the same task. Take the drag you have already constructed and cut the vertical prongs at the front end. Then bend the prong down until it is at a right angle to the rest of the drag. You can do this however many times you would like, depending on how thick the grass is. The prongs will then cut through the grass when you drag it and help to spread the manure. <br>  This is a very cheap alternative to the expensive models, and if you want to weigh it down, just put 4"x6" board and there you go. Plus it's a lot cheaper to replace if it gets damaged. Hope this could be of help! Good luck!|`|8d25j8CYaa	You can use a stretch of chain link fence with wood on one end to weight it down.  Another way is to buy a 4foot by16 foot cattle panel for around $20 and weight one end with a 2 by 6. Then attach a chain to the other end and drag it.

geJM58L2aa	My baby does the same thing.  We've tried to leave her out.  She's do good if she was only alone for 10-20 minutes but one day we left her for an hour and came back to a destroyed house - tore up carpet, shredded every piece of paper she could find including money, and peed on the couch.  She's part beagle as well.  The only thing you can do is make sure your dog is active during the day when you are there.  Take him on walks and play with him as much as you can.  When you're gone, he misses you.  Why is he crated all ay and all night?  When you're at work it's understandable but what about when you're home?  My puppy used to bark and howl all night so my husband set up a bed on the floor in our bedroom.  It took a few hours to get her to realize what we wanted her to do.  We sat her on it and when she'd move we'd put her back and say "bed."  Now that's where she sleeps and she loves it.  She'll even go up there during the day and take a nap without me or my husband saying anything.<br>  <br>  ----- EDIT:<br>  <br>  After reading your additional comments I decided to do some research.  I'm not sure if it's something you've read already but I found a pretty good website.  It has a lot of tips an explanations for training your dog to stop barking.  Hopefully it helps!<br>  <a href="http://www.placervillevet.com/training_your_dog_to_stop_barking.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.placervillevet.com/training_y...</a>|`|0lcSi5tnaa	A proper bark collar would sure enough change his tune, lol!<br>  But also the dog is bored and does need mental stimulation, he needs to train, hunt, something but believe it or not beagles are working dogs and need and like to work.|`|033a5e91931aa693dfd0d410087ef5e8aa	Hi,<br>  You need to find this dog another home, or train it so your neighbors can have some peace.

Bored enough to amuse himself by barking all day long.  The dog needs more exercise - meaning walks and training.  Not meaning out in the yard with other dogs, hanging out with you or even going to play at the dog park - unless that play is with YOU and not other dogs.  Ie fetching at the park is good.  Wrestling with other dogs, not so good.  He needs the mental stimulation of having to follow commands.  The dog needs a job.|`|AA11281924	my mixed breed beagle did the same thing when he was 1-2 yrs old (he's 14 now)...I read in the paper at the time about dog "seperation anxiety"...That's what your dog is suffering.

ak9DrBSwaa	It'd be best to leave your pet in someone elses care if you'll be gone that long. Food you could probably leave enough of, but water would be another issue.<br>  <br>  Water bottles can get clogged or leak and should be cleaned. I wouldn't risk leaving my pet alone for a week if there was another option available.|`|lAjgMFTTaa	Yea i've done this before, just make sure u clean it out the day b4 you set off, and it's water is full give it some extra food in its bowl, and some hamster treats and itt'l be fine!!|`|nMe35c9Aaa	it will be fine, most hamsters would like it more if you left them alone for a week. they are one of those animals i Truly believe are just tolerating us messing with them cause we ae nice enough to give them food.|`|wkK5JDz4aa	no,<br>  <br>  It will get all stinky and the ladies wont love him anymore.|`|I7yhk0DNaa	We do it every year for vacation...not a problem if you leave extra food and water..and no...they do not get mean after a week..if it was hand tame when you left it will be when you get back.|`|xsq9vT7Eaa	Thats NOT ok it will die if you do that !!|`|1bRRODd2aa	She -should- be OK, as long as it is warm enough, enough food and water for the week, with fresh bedding and shavings.<br>  <br>  It would, of course, be better for the hamster if you could find someone to look after it for the week.|`|tnEIPjccaa	I guess, technically, it would be fine if it had food and water that was guaranteed to last the whole time... But I wouldn't leave it alone. Plus, if you go that long without touching it, chance are, you'll have to domesticate it all over again when you get back. Leave it with some one else, who will feed, water, and play with it daily.
2IOFXmQ2aa	The qualities you are looking for are common to ALL dogs.  Dog breeds are like human races, it's the same genetic make-up for every breed/race.  A dog breed is just its outward appearance, its phenotype.  Personality is epigenetic, meaning it forms without help from genes or genetic traits.<br>  <br>  If you are set on getting a puppy, please get one that is at most 8 to 9 weeks old.  This is important.  At 8 weeks old, your puppy has just entered a stage of life called the 'critical period'.  This period of time lasts 'til the age of 16 weeks.  During this time, you should socialize your pup with your other pets.  Be sure to reinforce positive behaviors your puppy shows around your pets.  In this critical period, your dog must be exposed to every thing he or she will encounter in its adult life.  This is also an ideal time to begin training your pup.<br>  <br>  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.|`|bl8co4hUaa	Golden retrievers get along with virtually ANYthing and anyONE, yet are still protective. Just keep in mind that they tend to be hyper dogs for the first few years, and will need plenty of exercise and romping as well as firm obedience training. Consider getting a mongrel that has a lot of golden retriever in it; mongrels really do seem to make the best dogs, and you avoid any bred-in problems that can happen with pure breeds.<br>  <br>  If you would rather have a small dog, that tends to 'think like a big dog,' consider the very friendly pug. Again, a mongrel with pug...<br>  <br>  And nothing wrong with a spoodle, I wouldn't think, lol.|`|QEEweJUaaa	PIT-BULL!|`|xetVyGOdaa	A Bichon Frise would be perfect.

I would need more info.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Unless you are willing to dedicate the time and effort into properly socalizing your new dog with your current pets then stay away from terriers, hounds and any other breed bred to hunt small game.  With proper socilization from a young age these breeds can be kept with small pets but it takes work as these are the animals they have been bred to hunt and that instinct is still there.     Beyond that it is going to depend on what breed best fits with your lifestyle.  No one can accuratly make any real suggestion based on the little information you provided.  <br>  <br>  A "Spoodle" is not a breed is it a mixed breed aka a mutt.  If you want a purebred dog get a purebred from a responsilbe breeder.  If you want a mixed breed get a dog from the shelter don't support irresponsible breeding by buying a mixed breed from a "breeder"

OaaJ7o9Haa	Yes you can keep your betta in 70F, but you should raise the temp. 78F is better, but bettas can thrive in a range between 68-80F. The main problem with keeping temps in the lower spectrum is that your fish's metabolism slows down and they'll act lethargic and eat less. Also, lower temperatures make them more susceptible to diseases. Your heater should be adjustable, up it a few degrees.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	No. He'll become lethargic.<br>  <br>  78-82F.

You can also add fish to your dog's diet and a raw egg or two per week with the shell|`|6SeWCfUfaa	The switch will help a lot.  The corn in pedigree dog food can cause itchy flakey skin in a lot of dogs.|`|bsqSaXhQaa	My lab is the same way.<br>  At this time of year especially, it's just dry outside.<br>  Switching food does help. Both my dogs are on Diamond dog food too.<br>  <br>  Oil will definitely help. But nothing too rich. Cod Liver Oil is probably best.<br>  <br>  Also an oatmeal bath/rinse will help the flakiness too. I just took my lab to the groomers last week and he had the oatmeal bath/rinse and the flaking has lessened. I also just went to cub the other day and found another shampoo that helps with flaky, itchy skin called Sergeant's fur so fresh dog shampoo: Medicated formula for dry, itchy, flaky skin with green tea tree oil.<br>  <br>  EDIT: No olive oil! It's too rich for a dog. Talked to my vet about that just a couple days ago. Could make him sick.|`|AA10397285	It could be because of the cold climate however it could be an allergy as well. <br>  Puppy's can give different signals and sometimes it's tough to diagnose. <br>  <br>  If the air is dry where you are and/or let's say there is an excessive amount of cigarett smoke around, this can cause dryness. <br>  <br>  As a vet I can say I had many customers that give their puppies fish oil vitamins.

Don't keep this going much longer because you will find your puppy releiving him/herself frequently.|`|K2KNBei7aa	they winter (depending on where you live) could defiantly have a reaction in your dogs skin just like it has in humans. However dogs have their own essential oils that they need to keep their skin moist so it doesn't dry up so over bathing them can dry them out, but when you do give him a bath use moisturizing shampoo. Also brushing regularly will help too, it gets the blood flowing and again helps bring out those oils they have. I wouldn't worry too much right now...it doesnt sound like anything too bad.|`|BKxAt8mNaa	You could try adding a little olive oil to his food (no more than 50ml) and rubbing some sudocream on overly flakey bits to see if that helps.<br>  But like you said, this is winter and alot of animals do get dry skin naturally.

UUQXNhMtaa	There are oils in that dry food that can become rancid.  The dog has licked all over the bowl and there are bacteria from that, both good and bad ones. Consider your own habits.  If you have a sandwich and put it on a plate do you put the plate back in the cabinet when you are done? Probably not, it goes in the dish washer right?

Eventually they will get the idea that when they fight there eardrums get busted..haha but seriousally thats what i did. and it worked|`|5apGkgS9aa	put some thing in the tank eg piece of see thru plastic to seperate the goldfish from the new fish they can then get used toeach other but cant fight.leave or a week they should be ok its a terrotry thing|`|430hwnLqaa	You could try separating them by putting a sheet of glass across your tank that way they can see each other an get used to being in the same tank Remove the glass after about two weeks|`|lAjgMFTTaa	you can get tank splitters to half the tank down the middle, they have holes big enough for the water to still filter, but it makes the tank look a bit crappy|`|cyt7oh97aa	I'm afraid that your goldfish is preferring to be an only child.  Put him back in his bowl and let the fancy fish live in the new tank.  It's either that or you're going to come home one day with some dead fish.|`|mD4fD1KBaa	get one of those seperators..it's a clear plastic that fits in the tank. It has holes in it for water flow and for babies to get back and forth.it is hardly noticable and will work for this situation|`|r63DBSATaa	Dude, theyre fish.<br>  Either you get rid of the ones that are causing the comosotion. Or you can Just let them all kill eachother.|`|4LIbHFPpaa	Get the Fish Whisperer around.<br>  <br>  Ell D<br>  <br>  Extra: I know this is serious, but mootish, thats such a good idea!|`|iQ13PoEiaa	get them armor and fight to the death.|`|ESWqGNtiaa	its just the way nature works, no matter what species. they'll learn to get on.|`|KYHKkfEcaa	fishes will do it......|`|65kREIwQaa	Try this - it has remarkable results and it is what we recommend to cichlid owners that are having trouble introducing new fish into a tank.<br>  <br>  No matter how big your tank is, sometimes new members are not well received.  Often this is because fish establish territories and then tend to defend them (some fish just fight, but that is probably not the case with goldfish like yours).  What you need to do is 'reset' the playing field so that everyone can establish some space of thier own and the fish that came first don't feel invaded.<br>  <br>  The easiest approach to this is to just rearrange some of your decorations - and see if that helps.  If not the more drastic approach is to take out your decorations (might as well clean your tank at this point) and let the fish swim around for an hour or so then redecorate with them in other areas of the tank.|`|ny6xVEAtaa	there are fish that are aggressive and don't get along every well and if you were to get a separator and get them apart for a bit in the same tank because usually goldfish don't like fancy tail its the way they show them self's off that bothers them that they show them self off so your going to hae to separate them|`|3MwiahfJaa	erm, may be a daft question, but how the hell do fish fight???? what do they do swim into each other!??!  anyway i wouldnt worry its not like they can hurt each other they have no teeth, lol. but if they carry on id split them up. : )|`|sOCLwxnFaa	take one out and put it down the toilet lol|`|43iywBGSaa	mine did that and i split them up
w9aR8ymGaa	I would make sure you have the entire story but make sure your friend contacts an attorney.<br>  <br>  From past experience, I would definitely guess there is more to this situation.<br>  <br>  I hope that the vet didn't decide to spay just because the dog has problems delivering.  Many small dogs require C-sections.  <br>  <br>  After all of that, the owner may have opted not to put her girl through that again and just stopped breeding her and the spay wouldn't have been necessary and she could have continued showing.<br>  <br>  Sad.|`|Chxoncy7aa	It is not common for a vet to automatically spay unless it is requested.  However, in certain emergency situations it may be required.  If that was not the case for this finished champion, I would contact an attorney.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Maybe it was an emergency situation where a spay was required to save the dogs life?|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	I'm sure there as a whole lot more to the story then simply a vet spaying during a c-section..and I would be willing to bet that the whole rocedure was   discussed with theowner beforehand that consent forms were signed (likely the owner never read what they signed, however it still is valid) Consent forms ALWAYS must be signed before ANY surgery....<br>  Two sides to this story.|`|EZ5mwUF3aa	The vet had NO right to spay the dog!!! Her being a show dog I would sue the pants off that vet!!!<br>  There is NEVER a life threatening situation where they have to spay a dog, he was out of line, period!<br>  Imagine going to the hospital to get your appendix removed and come out with no ovaries?|`|AA10029366	No. The vet should *always* discuss the options with the owner, prior to making a surgical decision.<br>  <br>  Even if the uterus was in tatters due to some massive problem, and the dog could never be bred again anyway, the situation MUST be discussed with the owner prior to removing it.<br>  <br>  I have had b*tches spayed during c-sections. But it was always my decision, and my vet has always asked for my consent first.<br>  <br>  I would seriously consider suing this vet for malpractice, were that my dog.<br>  <br>  ADD: Jen - Curious as to how a dog "exceeds" its breed standard...especially when there certainly is too much of a good thing.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I would be suing that vet's a**, and reporting them to their governing body.<br>  <br>  They have NO RIGHT to perform ANY elective surgery without the owner's permission - especially a RISKY one such as a spay during a c-section.<br>  <br>  The one time I had a c-section, my vet recommended NOT to do the spay until the b*tch had recovered from the litter, she said the blood vessels were enlarged and there was a higher chance of a bleed-out.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine DID have a b*tch bleed out and die following a c-section spay.<br>  <br>  I would be absolutely livid if this happened.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just because a b*tch needs a c-section, does NOT mean that she likely to need another.  A malpresentation could occur, it happens sometimes and has nothing to do with the b*tch's suitability for breeding.  Sometimes a pup is simply too large. Sometimes the litter is very large and the b*tch gets tired.  Many such b*tches go on to naturally whelp litters later on.  If a b*tch needed a second c-section, or had issues that would make a section mandatory or likely in subsequent litters, then I would give serious consideration to spaying.|`|b807f13da6719d3e3a726d7eb53fb59daa	I totally disagree,as I had this same thing happen on one of my Yorkies a few years ago.Unless the vet had a "SIGNED" contract about spaying the dog,your friend has a chance on retrieving the cost of the pet in a court of law.I share in your friend's delima and this type of practice basically states this vet is out for the money,so friend should be the same way against him.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	That IDIOT should/would have gotten his/her AZZ SUED OFF!!!<br>  How DARE it ???<br>  You'd have had to pry me off it's THROAT!!!! & it would have needed brain surgery from getting it's head slammed into the wall<br>  WHY wasn't the owner ASKED for permission? WHERE was the owner?<br>  <br>  <br>  added="normal practice"????? If I was in charge,his "normal" practice would be limited to taking URINE samples at a Tiajuana race track.|`|pGacaRuFaa	If there was a lot of damage to the mother, it might have been medically necessary. It is hard to say without knowing the vet's side of the story. On the other hand, they should have asked the owner if it wasn't life threatening for the dog.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Well, I am surprised that the vet would do this without her consent and if that is the truth then she should contact the veterinarian malpractice division of the state licensing office and also sue the vet.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Live and learn ... this is actually the breeders fault.  Breeding the dog when she was moving and didn't have a vet she trusted lined up before the fact, was irresponsible.  No good, responsible breeder would ever do that.  They'd wait till the next cycle to breed or wait till the pups were whelped to move.  <br>  <br>  So, in my opinion, the vet probably did the right thing.  Being a show dog does not automatically make a dog a good candidate for breeding.  Having a CH in their title means only that the dog meets the breed standard, not that it exceeds the standard.  Only dogs that exceed the standard should be breed.  And frankly, if the dog was that great, the owner would have been more careful about the vet they took the dog to.<br>  <br>  That aside, there might have been other reasons the vet went ahead and spayed.  Sometimes with C-sections, that is the only realistic thing to do because of damage that's done to the uterus during the C-section.<br>  <br>  Edit:  And yes, this is something vets have done for at least 30 years.  I've seen it happen plenty of times over my lifetime.  But again, the owner should have made sure she had a vet she trusted standing by intead of taking the dog to an unknown vet.  And a good, repsonsible breeder would have already known that with a new vet, it might be their policy to spay after a C-section.  <br>  <br>  Your friend isn't quite as experienced or ready to be a breeder as she seems to think she is.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Totally out of order!  Yes, it might have been necessary to save her life, but spaying at the same time as a surgery for a Section is incredibly hard on a ******, if not downright dangerous, and if she was one of mine, I'd be going nuts!!  Do we know whether this vet contacted the owner at any time during the C.Section procedure?  Some serious questions need to be asked, at the very least.<br>  <br>  Edit - just read your add on - this vet thinks he's God!  Sue the b***ard!!!  When you entrust your animal to a vet, it does NOT give him the right to perform any procedure, without getting the owners consent.  And if this is his 'normal procedure' then this should have been made clear to the owner when the ****** was admitted!!!!!  Words fail.|`|JREyMH4zaa	We had a dog come in for a c-section, and due to complications, the vet had to do a spay in order to stop the dog from bleeding to death. it saved the dog's life, but the owner was livid since she could no longer breed the dog. I can't see a vet doing a spay just for the sake of it, but I do understand doing it to save the dog.<br>  <br>  *most dogs that do come in for c-sections should be spayed since they will end up with the same problems if bred again...but that's just my 2 cents..|`|FoeyqAZqaa	First of all if thats the case the person should not even be considered a vet. If they do not reguard the owners wishes then they shouldn't even have a license.
rDl9XR76aa	haha... like the title of your question--good attention catcher.<br>  <br>  Well really... Your 10 gallon is already overstocked. I'm suprised they are doing okay with that many in there.<br>  <br>  Off topic from your question about your platys babies... Keep your 10 gallon. I would go to Walmart... They sell a 29 gallon tank kit. It's about 60 dollars and it comes with everything, minus decorations and gravel. Even comes with a heater and a stick on thermometer. <br>  <br>  Cycle it with pieces of your current tanks filter and gravel... and feed the tank little ammounts of your fish food once a day for a few weeks. Test it and when your ammonia and nitrite read zero.. put your grown fish in bags and float them at the top of your new 29 gallon tank so they can gradually get to temp of your new tank. Slowly add the new tanks water to their bag (Like less than half a measuring cup every 15-30 minutes) so they gradually become accustomed to new water.<br>  <br>  When ph in their bag and ph in water are identical.. dump 'em in.<br>  <br>  Now then... Back to your 10 gallon. KEEP IT. Put an even 1 layer of marbles along the bottom. You now have your regular tank, and you now have a breeding tank (which can also double as your hospital tank.. just hopefully no one gets sick at the same time you've got fishies layin eggs or havin live births)..<br>  <br>  <br>  The only thing that sucks.. Your platy is gonna have her babies before the new tank is ready. So prepare yourself now if your really attached to your pet fishies.. cuz the fry aren't going to make it. Basically... expect the worst and if they survive, then you will be really happy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Future reference, too... If you aren't really wanting to breed your fish... you could make your new 29 gallon a real community tank.. put lots of different decorations and plants in of all different sizes and maybe even a floating plant... so if there are future babies born in the tank, they will have plenty of hiding spots. <br>  <br>  Just hopefully your egg laying fish don't do what my friends Angels did and lay the eggs on the filter spout... cuz as soon as they hatched, the swam down towards the bottom and got sucked right into the filter... dumbdumbdumb...|`|51b5298f89b92e7510c0d6fbc0524963aa	Your 10 gallon tank has too many fish. You want about 1 inch of fish (grown size) for each gallon of water. You also need to figure that a 10 gallon tank doesn't mean that there is 10 gallons of water in the tank. Plants, the terra cotta pot, filter and heater all take up room and mean that there is less water. Also if you have gravel in the tank that takes up room too. You might want to invest in a larger tank and leave the one that you think is pregnant in the 10 gallon until she has her babies, then remove her. Best of luck.|`|9GXSpe3aaa	wtf thats a lotta freakin fish lol !! you'll have to clean the tank like every day which would be a total PAIN in your @ss  but if you want to qo for itt ... i'd invest in another tank or see if a pet store will buy some of the babies from you|`|8d67984dad3cff176dee1c35f5b830c0aa	It depends. Do you want your fish to live? <br>  <br>  If you do, you do not want to stuff 87 fish in a 2 gallon aquarium.|`|dAJiXPecaa	You can put them in the toilet for all I care.|`|btHait6kaa	Ok, let's make this simple, Absolutely Not!!|`|ii0hMr0caa	Yeah, but you might not get the water in!|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	If she has her babies in that tank, they will be ok. Up until the point they get eaten. Just about every fish will eat baby fish. Even the parents will most of the time, eat their babies.<br>  <br>  Why do some people not read the details...?|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	No! You can put about 2 goldfish in a 2 gallon tank.<br>  <br>  Your 10 gallon tank is fine. It has the right amount of fish. I don't know about the mix of fish, but the number is fine.<br>  <br>  The babies will definitely be eaten by the other fish. Especially the bettas.|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	Ok rule of thumb is 1 inch of fish per gallon<br>  <br>  no you would need a 15 gallon tank with no gravel or caves or anything that would take up space. for the amount of fish you want to put in there<br>  <br>  Remember that rule goes for the actual amount of water in the tank not the amount of water that the tank is capable of holding.  Rocks, gravel things like that take up space, or displace an water.  If you do put these fish in the tank then you will have an increase of ammonia, decreased amount of oxygen and the stress of the fish will cause them to kick off faster|`|D178335Paa	should be. but the other fish will eat them so most likely about 5 will live. if your platy is large and or has a black spot by it's anal fin she's pregnant|`|coj54cacaa	Maybe we should see if YOU will fit in a two gallon aquarium....|`|mOayTJDmaa	No<br>  And that 10g isn't big enough either.
u3Hdoeiqaa	I don't think your parents are being stupid. It is probably either that they simply don't understand guinea pigs or that they have concerns about caging / floor time.<br>  <br>  I think you might need to appraoch this problem from both angles - explain to your parents exactly what your pets need, and why it is so important, and then put their minds at rest that it isn't going to cause them any problems.<br>  <br>  To explain about guinea pigs I would suggest looking on some good guinea pig websites. The best ones are these:<br>  <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.guinealynx.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guinealynx.info/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cavyspirit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cavyspirit.com/</a><br>  <br>  On those sites you can find lots of excellent info on the importance of proper sized caging, floor time etc.<br>  <br>  Try to find out what exactly your parents object to:<br>  <br>  If they are worried about the mess your pigs might make on the floor, do you have any rooms with lino or tile floors that are easily cleaned? Maybe your parents would let you give them floor time there so you can sweep up poops and wash the floor afterwards. Another option is to put down a decent layer of newspaper or some old towels to soak up pee, which you can then throw away or in the wash.<br>  <br>  As for getting a bigger cage maybe they are concered about space or moeny?<br>  If it is cost, you could consider a c+c cage. These are usually far cheaper than any store bought cage. <br>  You could also buy a rabbit run - these are usually cheap second hand - and then just use coroplast or lino for the floor.<br>  You could also offer to save up to pay for a new cage yourself.<br>  <br>  If space is a problem, see if there is any way you could make more room. This might be by throwing out old stuff you don't use, or just re-arranging things to make them better organised and take up less space.<br>  Before I got my pigs you wouldn't have thought I could fit a shoe box in my house it is so full - but just a bit of spring cleaning and moving stuff arouns and I managed a huge cage (about 13 sq feet!)<br>  <br>  Obviously getting a proper sized cage is the most important thing for your guinea pigs health and welfare, so lpease keep trying to convince your parents. Try not to get mad or fight about it - just be reasonable and hope they come round.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  PS: Some people have given you some very dangerous advice. Please do NOT put your guinea pigs on a leash or in a ball! These are incredibly risky - your guinea pigs could break their backs,|`|ePkiOzPSaa	You should not approach them with the attitude that they are being "stupid".  Show that you are responsible, show them several websites/books/other resources that give hard evidence that guinea pigs do need these things for a good life.<br>  <br>  Barring anything else, if his conditions are not conducive to his thriving (not just surviving) you should probably find someone who will adopt him who can give him better care, or hand him over to a no kill shelter.  It may be hard, but it's the right thing to do if you can't currently provide what the guinea pig needs.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|oNHtVHzsaa	when it gets nice outside, guinea pigs love to run around in the grass if possible. if you get a small dog pen (that they can't slip through) they love to run around and eat grass. but make sure they aren't around dogs cause they can get heart failure from being chased. also, explain to them NICELY that if they guinea pigs don't get enough exercise that it can keep them from being healthy and living long. also, do a little research, and print some stuff out. have proof. good luck and hope this helps.|`|4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	I agree with the excellent advice given by Flute.<br>  <br>  You could also look for a small child's plastic swimming pool to use for exercise time. This contains the piggies and is easy to clean.<br>  <br>  I know sometimes parents do not understand, but they are not "stupid". Be respectful. You'll catch more bees with honey than vinegar. Just sayin'.|`|juyA6HUJaa	Don't listen to the people saying get a ball or wheel that's even worse for them than not letting them have any floor time at all!... these can seriously harm your piggie. They only have fragile bones and it can break their back or make them walk funny. erm... you could show them a website with info about how guinea pigs need floor time, or maybe question why they dont approve and come up with ways to prevent it..for example you get guinea pig poop on the floor... say you'll put a blanket down etc.|`|TrTfowAQaa	do your home work...get lots of info together and print it off. ask them nicely to please read it. let them know your just looking out for the best interest of your little friends. remind them that they can't stand up & say what they need so it's your job to make sure that needs are met. also listen to the reasons your rents are giving on why no floor time or no bigger cage... if they concerned about cleaning up after it let them know you can put something down on the floor or keep them on the tile so its easy for YOU to clean up. & good luch.|`|pHoqVJC0aa	First of all i am taking it to men that by 'floor time' you mean running around the floor, therefore getting exercise? Right, if i am right then i think your parents may be worried about your guinea pigs soiling the carpet. Talk to them about it and you could even attempt to potty train your guinea pigs (which , if you stick at it is easily done!)<br>  Research and print articles on the computer about guinea pigs not getting enough exercise, becaue two guinea pigs require as much exercise as a small dog! I hope i've helped X|`|EXWpMIZJaa	Do the "floor time" in a tiled bathroom with the door closed and locked, thats what I do with my rats all the time.  If your parents dont like that idea then tell them my guinea pigs need to be played with, they can't just sit around doing nothing for the rest of their life!!! think if that happend to you! if they run around in a bathroom then if they pee or poop it'll be easy to clean up. hope i could help!! =)|`|3sB49YNnaa	Trying to convince them that they are stupid is a non-starter!  Think about how you feel when someone tells you that you are stupid!<br>  <br>  You need a double edged approach.  Side 1 is to provide them with information that says that floor time is good for guinea pigs.  Side 2 is compromise.  Suggest floor time in a tiled space like a bathroom or mud room (where the washer & drier is located) where you can use a beach towel on the tile for the pigs.  You will also have to promise that you will wash the floor and towel thoroughly when floor time is done.  If they say yes, be sure you keep your promise or it will be back to permanent lock down for your pigs.<br>  <br>  Ignore the advice about balls for exercise.  They are very hard on a guinea pig's back
6SeWCfUfaa	If you adopted her from a shelter, odds are she's already fixed.  Didn't you ask?<br>  <br>  If she's been spayed, it's likely she has a scar from it.  If you don't see one, take her to the vet and have them look.  Sometimes they're not easy to see.  But ... you should really call who you adopted her from and ask them if she's spayed.  I can't believe they wouldn't have told you or made it a requirement for adoption in the first place.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	Cut vocal cords from a dog?! the old owners? A vet will know if she was fixed but id she was not you should get her fixed estrus is messy, and it  is also to help avoid pregnancies. It costs between 80 (spay neuter clinic) and 360 for a whole package deal. It is worth the cost. The 'kennel' should know and or should do it before they adopt it out.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes get her fixed if she hasn't been already.  A vet will be able to tell if she's been spayed or not.|`|Bw18seFqaa	the vet can determine if she's been fixed or not..  if she hasnt been, yes, get her fixed.  Spaying will help prevent certain types of cancers, and will also prevent deadly uterine infections, as well as unwanted litters.<br>  <br>  Some breeders de-bark their dogs..  not uncommon for puppy millers and horders to do that so the dogs make less noise, so that neighbors dont complain about the number of dogs.<br>  <br>  Spay, depends on the size of the dog and what vet's in your area charge..  if its a small dog, $65-100..  medium- large dog maybe around $100-150 or so..  a giant dog, can cost up to $250.|`|PKULDaC7aa	You should check with your vet to find out if she is fixed, they should be able to tell you. As far as a price, at my vet I think it was around $120 to get my Great Dane fixed. And no it is not too late if she has not been fixed. And PS, getting a dog's vocal cords cut is cruel, I know you didn't do it but just saying.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Poor little girl.  How cruel her old owners were.  I'm glad to know she is in safe hands now.  Bless both your hearts.<br>  <br>  No it is not too late to get her spayed if she hasn't been already done.<br>  <br>  I had found a Dalmatian X in an abandoned Dairy & couldn't feel a scar from a spaying so I kept a close eye on her until I had money to get her & a male done at the same time.<br>  <br>  I took her & the male in to AHA cause I qualified for their low income program & she was spayed so all she got was shots & a chip, the male got neutered, shots & a chip.  All of this cost me $73.  But it would be a lot more if I wasn't on a low income, disability.  If you receive a government check you qualify for the low income prices.  This could have cost me about $300 or more at a regular Vet.<br>  <br>  Call around to several Vets to see how much they would charge for a spay or to at least check her to see if she has been spayed.  It would be a good idea to go ahead & take her in for  a general check up & you can find out then if she has or has not been spayed.<br>  <br>  Here in NM we have to have them current on Rabies & carry a chip & if you live in the city limits you also have to have a license.|`|JsBb732Maa	The vet will be able to tell if she's spayed, there should be a scar. They charge according to the weight of the dog so you'll have to ask the vet the cost. Yes, get her spayed if not already done. Great of you to give her a home. :-)|`|AA12322387	A vet can tell if she's been fixed.  It could cost from $50 to $200 depending where you go.  There may be a low cost program in your community.  I always recommend pre-surgery blood work.  It's very important to ensure that vital organs are functioning properly before an animal is put under anesthesia.<br>  <br>  And to the other poster, no, cutting vocal cords isn't illegal in the U.S., though most vets prefer not to perform the surgery.|`|7Cis2pJEaa	They would cut her vocal cords if she was a breeding dog, that was kept outside all the time. Very common in puppy mill situations. Did you buy her from a breeding kennel (AKA puppy millers), or a shelter? In most, if not all, states is a law that a rescue must have an animal spayed before its adopted out, or at least make you sign a contract that you will have it done ASAP. <br>  Its never to late to have it done either. I adopted a dog that was about that age, and she was just spayed. She recovered fast, and is now a great family pet.  Around here they have clinics that charge $50-120 depending on weight of dog. But you will have to take her to a vet to be able to tell if she is spayed, so they don't accidentally cut her open to find that it has already been done.<br>  Its the best thing for you and her to just have it done. Dogs do not miss their uterus. They don't wish they had puppies. They are most happy being family members. Its what they are domesticated for!|`|pGacaRuFaa	Check under her fur for the scar. Some vets go in on the tummy, and some on the side, so you will have to look all over her abdomen. Depending on the size of the dog, the scar could be several inches long. It is never too late to get a dog fixed, and the price varies depending on the vet, size of the dog, and any complications that arise.|`|qiLKlSmHaa	Take her to your vet...she probably could use a good exam and you can aks the vet then.  I think that while she can still get pregnant, its probably a good idea to have her fixed...but even with that, you need to ensure she's healthy enough for the procedure.  Good luck with the dog...I hope she's found a wonderful new home.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	WHAT did you say?

That is a serious life threatening problem.  There is another consideration.   He could have an enlarged prostate gland that could be putting pressure on the urethra which runs through the gland.  Your vet should do blood work a urinalysis and a rectal exam to check his prostate gland.   Hope all goes well.  Let us know how he does.|`|p1gzHgAraa	take him to the vet. he may have a UTI, or some kind of blockage (stones)- or a narrowing of his uteter. either way, a vet needs to check him out.. plus hes really old, so it may be an age related illness.|`|aHi8KHj1aa	It's most likely one of three things - diabetes, urinary tract infection, or kidney disease.  Does he drink alot of water?  Does he seem painful when he urinates or in the abdominal area in general?  You should take him to the vet so they can check his urine.  Urine testing can help rule out any of these three possible causes.  Good luck!|`|KIHuDCZ9aa	lol

There are several from peaceful fish like guppies to aggressive fish like cichilds. I usually keep my peaceful ones in a smaller tank, around 10-15 gallons and i use my large tanks 30 and up for aggressive fish.

Anything that gets up to 8inches and live in a 29 gallon tank because i have kept tons of fish, so i do know what is and what's not good for them.

Most likely this is a sign he's ready to go (you know what i mean rat heaven) I would put the friendly-est one in the cage with him yes.  he might get depressed with out a friend.  keep an eye on him tho if he props his head uncomfortably then that's a sign hes really ill and very uncomfortable.

GdBG4PGYaa	My pets are definitely my family! <br>  <br>  If I had a cat, it would be my baby. My sisters dog (that she gave to me) is my little girly, and my gerbils are my boys.<br>  The bird is birdy, but he is more like a cousin (I'm not really close to him as I am with the other pets. He isn't mine either).<br>  <br>  If money was tight I have enough that I could pay for all of the animals food, and I would in a heartbeat!<br>  <br>  My opinion is, that animals shouldn't be better than people or your real children or family but they should be very important. You have to care for them.<br>  <br>  The last straw would be that I couldn't take care of the, and they would have a better life with somebody else. I don't want to be selfish and keep the animals when they were obviously suffering. That would be considered abuse in my book.<br>  <br>  I really love all animals! I will do my best whenever an animal is in need. :)<br>  Thank you for the great question! You are a wonderful pet owner!

Some people have to give up their kids too because they don't have money to feed them.<br>  <br>  I know my mom and dad would do everything they could to keep all our animals.  About 4 years ago when my cat was really sick, my dad sold a bunch of stocks and we gave up our vacation for two years and had a very small xmas and birthdays because they used a lot of their savings to get the money to pay for his hospital bills.

I have no human kids and never will. My two dogs, 18 cats and bird ARE my family. What little human family I have are butt holes. They think I'm nuts with all my cats.

They don't judge me or talk behind my back like so called family.<br>  <br>  They are always happy to see me, sleep beside me and groom me like another cat.

They are definately a part of our family. There is no way I could put them in a shelter, I would rather give up all my posessions. My sister took them away from us when I was 10, and that was one of the worst times of my life. She was a lousy caretaker too, so they were very miserable living with her, and traveling across the country in the back of a freezing mover truck. When she brought them back they were so skinny and scared. I can never forgive her for that. Ever since then I have been trying to spoil them to make up for that miserable trip they had to go through.<br>  <br>  I am an animal freak, yes, but theres nothing wrong with having compassion!<br>  <br>  P.S.

All bets are off at bedtime though. No animals allowed in the sleeping areas at night. Moot point anyway, as the cats prefer to sleep up against the dog. The only other restriction is at mealtime. No pets allowed near the table.<br>  <br>   I have never, would never surrender any pet to a shelter.

k2l20XdFaa	Thanks for posting this. I have been talking about the proposed  bills for months on Answers and nobody seems to care. This is only one of many and from my observation on this site, more people keep getting reptiles they know nothing about and it makes me just a little mad. Those are the people who should never have reptiles. They are arrogant impulse buyers that affect all of us responsible herp keepers and breeders. Most people don't under stand that there turtles, snakes (other than boas and pythons), lizards, frogs, toads, and birds will all get affected by these proposed bans. I am a member of USARK, I just wish more people would take this seriously. My wife and I are starting a large constrictor sanctuary to help control the population of these animals in the wild.|`|UZYT8eMwaa	Hopeful others will take heed and do their part|`|RkK673VHaa	shocker, another bill, your aware anti reptile keeping bills like this come about once every month or so, so far very few have even been taken seriously let alone passed.

Secondly dogs are in heat for weeks so its not nothing abnormal going on as long as that vagina is swollen keep the male away from her!|`|Os6VjLH0aa	If she did get bred you probably need to talk to the vet about an emergency spay/abort.<br>  When a ***** comes in season the first week to 10 or 11 days they will bleed, this is a "clean out/preparation period, then the discharge will be clear or milky, this is when the ***** is actually ovulating and will accept males, this usually lasts for 4-7 days, the last week or so the ***** will bleed again, though not as much as in the first part of estrus.

MstjbpVJaa	Yes your bird needs a companion,male or female if you want to breed.<br>  Zebra's are a very sociable bird and do need a companion.|`|fWf3A3Ioaa	Yes - they NEED a companion.<br>  Finches are flock birds and thrive when they have at least one other finch to keep them company.<br>  Also, Zebras are similar to Societies in that they are VERY social and seek affection and attention from their own kind.<br>  Your finch will not do well alone!<br>  And yes - you should try for a larger cage.<br>  18" is just simply not enough flight room to keep your bird in optimal health - even for a single finch.|`|pYF9KnNeaa	Nixity has given you very good advice.  I'd just like to add one comment about the cage.  For Finches, width is much more important than height.  They need to be able to fly from one end of the  cage to the other so that they are getting proper exercise.  I would guess that someone at a pet store told you your cage would be just fine.  That's because they just wanted to sell it.  The fact is, a cage that size is not good for anything beyond decoration or hanging a plant in it, etc.  For sure, get a companion Finch and try to find a much wider cage.  And good for you for being so concerned about the little critter.
C1eHfhrHaa	some dogs just don' tlike to play once they get out of the puppy stage.|`|FaPrr8bbaa	Bounce that tennis ball on the ground, on the wall and miss catching it occasionally.  Play by yourself whether they want to or not.  Then one day a few days later you will be surprised when a dog comes to your rescue and catches the one that you missed.  It will take a few days of several 10 minute sessions before they see the object of the game, but they will grab that ball.  Make sure you keep your voice calm, no matter how excited you are,  and say quietly "Good Job."  Oh and in case one is dominant, let them have mom all to themselves for this until they play well together.|`|wBbvGdkcaa	Hi!<br>  I have a Saint Bernard and she never learned how to play!

F3FrZ7eAaa	Check out your local phone book. Look up pet shops, it will give you a list of different shops you can give a call. In the newspaper too, there's always people trying to get rid of their old tanks in the classifieds section. If you're looking for online shops, try eBay perhaps. They have all kinds of stuff dirt cheap. You may even want to use tubs. Almost every reptile owner will agree that they are great-- inexpensive, holds heat and humidity well, comfortable for your pet, easy to make room for... the only downside is they aren't as "pretty" as tanks. If you got the rubbermaid/sterlite tub route, you can get them at almost any box store.

bl8co4hUaa	Indoor cats live, in general, considerably longer than those who go outdoors. (There are always individual exceptions.) Love and attention are MUCH more important than outdoor freedom! With the outdoors comes vehicles, mean people, poisonous plants and chemicals, and the killing of birds. For an indoor cat, providing them a window seat where they can look out, and a sunspot to lie in, is enough. It might be hard at first if the cat is already accustomed to going outside, but they can be weaned from it (I did with my calico after I lost her "big sister" to traffic).<br>  <br>  Also consider investing in an outdoor run designed for cats. That gives them space and sunshine. But cats, honestly, do not require a lot of space. Keep her active by playing mousie games and such with her, and cuddle her a lot. Also, outdoor cats tend not to be as attached to people, and may in fact leave home altogether. (Again, there are exceptions here.)|`|zeTGmB3faa	Your loving cat will do just fine with you and will be much safer inside the apartment.

Statistically, the life span of an indoor cat averages 12 to 14 years, whereas it is only about four years for the outdoor cat. More than 1 million outdoor cats are killed each year by dogs, traffic, and exposure to disease. In the long run, keeping your cat indoors will also save you money in vet bills.<br>  <br>  There are many risks that come with letting your cats roam free outside:<br>  - They have a much higher chance of catching diseases and other illnesses such as: Feline Leukemia (FeLV), Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), Feline Herpes Virus (Rhinotracheitis), Feline Distemper, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), rabies, tapeworm, ringworm, heart worm, hypothermia and urinary tract infection<br>  - Ingesting chemicals or poisons such as pesticides, home garden products and car/motor products<br>  - Getting fleas or ticks<br>  - Injury/death due to dangerous traffic <br>  - Eating poisonous spiders, insects or plants<br>  - Injury/death due to cruel humans, hunters or neighbors<br>  - Attacks from dogs, other cats or wild animals <br>  - Other accidental injuries<br>  - Getting lost or stolen|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Keep your cat - you are her world and she will want to stay with you.  With regard to allowing her on to the balcony - have a look at Petsnap.com website as they do a fantastic range of cat containment items which you can pop her into knowing that she is getting some fresh air but is safe as well.  Please dont allow her to go out onto the balcony without some kind of containment as she will almost certainly fall - just seeing a bird go by will make her jump up and go over the edge.|`|tnEIPjccaa	My cats have never been outside, other than for trips to the vet. They are perfectly healthy and happy. Letting your cat outdoors presents all sorts of dangers, such as fleas, parasites, and attacks from dangerous animals. Keep your pet with you, and give her lots of love, and she will be fine. =) They don't NEED to be outside.
AA10918808	Sorry to hear about your puss.  I just read an article in our local paper (Uxbridge Leader) today about hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland) which is common in older cats, and can lead to kidney problems...if that is any consolation.  <br>  <br>  It might be something to look out for if you adopt another older cat - seems the first symptoms are a lacklustre coat, constant hunger, diarrhoea and weight loss - it can be treated if caught early on.|`|AA11729974	Dry food diets can also contribute to feline diabetes, which can cause kidney or other organ failure.  Did your kitty pee a lot or have sweet-smelling breath?  If so, these are signs of diabetes.|`|00ZB2Inqaa	I think this site may offer the answers to the question you posed.<br>  <a href="http://www.felinegood.co.uk/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinegood.co.uk/index.shtml</a>|`|gdxkIGhGaa	It was probably just that it was getting old, unfortunatly.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	ask the vet|`|3qLIRorjaa	Kidney failure is the biggest killer in cats. It's very common and just one of those unfortunate things.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	I am sorry to hear of your loss.  Some cats are predisposed to kidney failure - about 50% of Persians will have Polycystic Kidney Disease - some will develop it due to old age and some will develop it as a result of a solely dry diet.  <br>  <br>  It is very sad - I have owned one Persian who died of kidney failure and it is awful to watch it happen.  If you did feed your cat a dry diet then now is the time to start researching the facts so that you can avoid it in the future.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	So many things can contribute to kidney failure.  Like someone said, some cats are genetically predisposed.  Others can develop it from poor diet, infections, from eating toxic substances, even from having tooth decay.  One big culprit is feeding junk cat food.  The high carb content in cheap foods and the low moisture content of dry food are very hard on the cat's system.  I'm very sorry your kitty died.  I have a cat in kidney failure too (from feeding a dry diet probably) and I wish I had done research and learned more about kidney failure before it was too late.  My cat is doing well now that I've started feeding him a high quality wet diet but if I had known, he might still have full kidney function.<br>  <br>  If you're still interested in learning more, here a couple of very good websites on the subject.<br>  <a href="http://www.felineoutreach.org/EducationDetail.asp?cat=KidneyDisease" rel="nofollow">http://www.felineoutreach.org/EducationD...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a>|`|GI27dKIkaa	My condolences !<br>  <br>  My neighbours cat has failure in one of her kidneys - she's at least ten years old (probably more like sixteen as she wasn't a kitten when she got her)  The vet told her that she'll probably only live another year - as the good kidney is now doing all the work - and will eventually fail too.|`|zeTGmB3faa	If your cat was a senior, the kidneys like other organs begin to shut down in older age. Some believe that a diet of only dry food can hasten this. It can occur for numerous reasons just as older parts of the body tend to effect other parts. I'm sorry for the loss of your your cat. Many of us have experienced this same heartbreak with out elderly cats. God Bless.
iuYtcX6Xaa	do not ask us! go ask a flippin vet already before your cat dies!|`|YAPYO7L8aa	I don't know. But I'd try another vet for a second opinion.|`|MfUS1XyQaa	Maybe he has a kitty stomach flu.

If not, the second link is a general index, but isn't as particular about the breeders, I don't think. You will want to stick with breeders with excellent reputations, so try the first link first to find your pup.|`|b807f13da6719d3e3a726d7eb53fb59daa	Look on the websites below,but be very careful,as many scammers on all sites.Check references,ask for a pic of pet wit your name on it in the pic,ask for vet's # and call all references.In this breed some Frenchies are prong to have genetic issues.<br>  <a href="http://www.puppyfind.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.puppyfind.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nextdaypets.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nextdaypets.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.k9stud.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.k9stud.com</a>
Po2UqfvWaa	yes they can, very common|`|zaYGRmOAaa	No, I think you have them confused with dingos. lol.|`|btHait6kaa	Unfortunately, it’s not at all uncommon to have a mother hamster eat some or all of her litter.  There’s no hard and fast reason for why they do this, although some theories exist.  For example, first-time mothers may be so shocked by the whole situation that they feel threatened by the new arrivals and simply eat them to remove the threat.  Also, first time mothers can produce pups that are undersized or abnormal, thus causing the mother to reject and possibly eat them.  <br>  <br>  Remember the advice about adding extra protein to the mother’s diet?  A good reason for this is that the mother may be craving extra nutrients after giving birth, and if they aren’t provided any other way she’ll eat her young to replenish herself.<br>   <br>  You must be extra careful not to handle the young until they are about 14 days old.  Doing so before then can cause the mother to reject the pup, causing her to ignore or eat it.  Also, pups born outside of the nest area may not be recognized by the mother, again causing the same cannibalistic behavior.<br>  <br>  It’s also thought that this behavior has something to do with making sure there’s enough food around to feed the number of pups born – the mother will eat enough young to make sure there’s enough food for the survivors.  However, we can’t really be sure why.  If you happen to see it, know that other than providing a warm and quiet environment for the mother and pups, along with plenty of food, there’s nothing else you can do to ensure the pups’ survival.|`|YwZSSwhMaa	They can.<br>  <br>  Well mice can.<br>  <br>  I have heard that they will also break their neck if they are in there for more then like 4 days.<br>  <br>  But that might just be a myth.<br>  <br>  And PLEASE try to help me with my question.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090305092542AAct1i7&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|v3dN1sSaaa	yes they will either eat them or just ignore them so they wont look after them and feed them so just be careful if your hamster has babies|`|HW8ybM2Paa	YES YES YES. Dont touch them !!!!!!! I've had the expierence!!! Dont touch them!|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Depends.<br>  <br>  Randomly breeding any two hamsters without a good idea of husbandry, genetics, diet and proper care then yes, its not uncommon. Many folks put very little thought into breeding and this is where you'll see problems.<br>  <br>  In a carefully selected and managed breeding program with someone who has done their research its RARE. It does happen, but only occassionally.|`|sNSfxZSTaa	Yes. Thats very true. You actually dont wanna touch them until they are eating on their own (usually about 4/5 weeks). If the mother picks up your scent on her baby she will either ignore it and let it die. Or kill it herself. My advice would be to stay away from them until they are about 5 weeks old.|`|TfuFjTMQaa	Mom's will eat babies. If you touch them, she may eat them to protect them, or because they have a funny smell. Resist touching them until 2-3 weeks, then she'll know them. :D|`|2vz59utAaa	I dunno about hamsters. <br>  <br>  But I do.|`|kBBFbTPiaa	some of them do
EJpiaCMQaa	Puffins protect themselves with a camouflage technique known as countershading (black backs and white stomachs).  When the puffin dives underwater, anything swimming above them will find it difficult to see the puffin because their black backs blend in with the bottom of the sea.  Anything below them will have a hard time seeing them because their white stomachs will blend in with the light coming down from the surface.|`|btHait6kaa	camouflage
