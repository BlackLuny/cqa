ce523a430537018c6bc4e5d03fae9995aa	Nicht wegen der Kosten (anscheinend fehlenden Gelder), sondern weil immer mehr in immer wenigere "Supersendungen" wie Gottschalk und Co. gesteckt wird und in teure Fu?ballberichterstattungen. Dabei ist der Fu?ball nicht das Problem, sondern der Wahn die Preise (Gelder, Forderungen) immer h?her zu treiben. Au?erdem wird nur auf Quoten geschaut, so dass der Geschmack des Einzelnen unter zu gehen droht, wennauch die ?ffentl. Rechtlichen dem entgegen zu arbeiten suchen - mehr oder weniger.<br>  <br>  Billigsendungen, wie Talkshows wo sich Asis mit ihren krummen Sichtweiten pr?sentieren dürfen sind (anscheinend) sehr beliebt. Manches mag interessant und aufschlussreich sein, aber im Gro?en und Ganzen ist es verdummend und das Volk wird zu einseitig von einer meist schmutzigen Seite gezeigt.<br>  <br>  Fernsehen hat auch mit Geschmack zu tun und bei der Masse der Sender (ich empfange Kabel und Digi) müsste doch was qualitativ gutes dabei sein?! Nun, ich, für meinen Teil, sehe oft das Problem, dass man in der Fülle die Sendungen, die einen besonders interessieren würden, vor lauten B?umen (im Wald) nicht sieht. Eine gute Fernsehzeitschrift würde ich empfehle, die viele Bilder und u.U. auch Berichte über Sendungen enth?lt. Aber auch die Freeware-Online-Zeitschrift TeXXas kann helfen, da man da nach Sachgebieten suchen kann - so z.B. auch nach dem Thema Bildung. Ich dachte es g?be keine Sprachkurse mehr, doch es gibt einige. Allerdings sind die alle alt. Sie liefen schon als meine Kinder noch klein waren - und ich habe schon ein 5-j?hriges Enkelchen!!!!

Meienr Meinung nach ist der Fernsehr nicht immer das schlechte,denn es gibt viele wichtige Dinge in deinem Leben die du durch den Fersehen erreicht hast.Was ich für nützlich halte ist immer; wenn mann eine Fernsher zeit am Tag abgrenst und nicht sich den ganzen Tag am Fernsehn aufhaltet denn es gibt auch viele Nachteile beim Fern gucken.Der k?rper bewegt sich dann kaum und mann bemerkt die vergehende Zeit garnicht und so ist doch der Tag ganz unbemerkst vergehen und langweillig.Ich mag das Fernsehen auch aber nur unter einer Bedingung, wenn ich nichts hintermir habe und, wenn ich etwas gucke was auch mir im Leben helfen kann, also was mich weiter bringt als zurück bringt.sowie z.B nachrichten .Nachrichten zu gucken ist nicht immer gut ,denn es gibt gute Nachrichten die dir gute Infos geben und es gibt überflüssige Nahcrichten die uns nichts wieterleiten und so verwendet mann zeit für Infos oder man verwendet Zeit für schwachsinn sowie nachrichten über stars( vieviele mal die geheiratetet haben wer mit wem zusammen ist und so ein kram.)im gegen satz kannst du dir die Nahcrichten über politische sachen oder auch andere gerichtliche sachen oder auhc tips und tricks im fern shene die dir weiter helfen und alles andere kann mann auch vergleichen filme musik und auch sogar die werbung.also denke immer dran bevor du etwas gucken willst .IST ES WAS üEBERFLüSSIEGIGES ODER BRINGT ES WAS WEITER.ALSO MERKE FERNSEHEN IST GUT UNTER EINER BEDINGUNG DIE ZEIT SOLL NICHT FüR SINNLOSE SACHEN GESCHAUT WERDEN SONDERN FüR NüTZENDE SACHEN:|`|c308fc251654080651829def2032f0c6aa	Weil l?ute wie herr hold und frau salesh eine stunde lang am tag das fernsehn beherrschen darum ist das tv schlecht|`|cab4fed7cbbeef06095c504fe0c053e9aa	Bei der Vielzahl an Programmen, wen soll man es recht machen früher gab's 2 Sender und die Regionalen und gemeckert wurde genau so, schalt den Quatsch aus und Ruhe ist...|`|fc6dc15ec491239d0a71c8d517617182aa	... angeblich, weil kein Geld da ist; m.E. aber, weil der Fernseh-Zuschauer einen immer schlechteren Geschmack repr?sentiert - woher k?me sonst diese ungeheure Menge an Schrott mit Talk-Shows, wo die Leute sich ohne Grund total offenbaren und danach vor Scham in den Boden versinken m?chten....<br>  Au?erdem stelle ich fest, dass es ungef?hr 10 x so viele Wiederholungen gibt wie früher - und dafür nur noch ganz selten so tolle Produktionen wie von  Wedel oder Spie? oder Dietl - das geschieht doch nur noch alle Jubeljahre, dass die mal was Neues produzieren und sich die gesamte Nation dann vor der Glotze trifft.

He also wouldn't have to worry about the next 20 years because he would not be living them.

Others think it is publicizing a major disease and make it seem more 'glamourous'. I too think that there are many other normal citizens in the same situation who do not have the opportunity to make life comfortable for family after he/she has gone. Personally, I think great she is doing it for her kids and we all ave the option whether or not to buy into this or not. But the other half of me thinks this has gone to far. It just shows how society is becoming more obsessed with possessions and people. <br>  <br>  The main advantage of the vast publicity she is recieving is the encouragement people will recieve to get themselves screened. If one person is influenced by this then all is not lost!

PueaHUIvaa	Considering that Russia did nothing wrong, other than protecting its citizens from the idiotic Georgian military (trained by the US and Israel, btw), I'd say its about time these d:cks resumed ties with Russia. How can an entire continent like Europe fall into some dumb crap like that. Its well established now that Georgia was the agressor, and Saakashvilli is lucky to not be sitting in the Hague. Im sure it has alot to do with Georgia being nothing more than an American and Israeli controlled asspuppet.

Yes, it's not at the level of GM failing or something like that, but it's all part of the mosaic.<br>  <br>  That said, this particular case raises a ton of ethical and moral questions. Does a mother have a right to have that procedure done, considering she can't afford to raise the children? Should doctors go through with such actions, and do they have the right to tell patients they won't do it? Medical frontiers keep changing.|`|8U0Wtop2aa	I think that the more negative press she gets, the better.  I don't think its fair for some of us normal people to struggle with our 3 or 4 kids when this woman is getting hundreds of thousands of dollars for being irresponsible and having 14 kids. <br>  <br>  The moral of the story is, if your struggling to support your family, start giving birth to multiples upon multiples and just maybe you'll get money for it.

So if millions of stupid people get mislead by some dick like OReilly, who cares. Religions and Political parties are both absurd and the people who subscribe to them are morons.<br>  <br>  OK. Think about this. Who owns the big media outlets? Big corporations. HUGE corporations.  Now then, who do HUGE corporations NOT like? Liberals. Everyones is always going on about how socialism and liberalism is bad for big business.

The anchors, the reporters, even Fox & Friends in the morning all show conservative bias and just general dislike of anything Democrats do, and they're supposed to be impartial newspeople.<br>  <br>  And if it was really fair & balanced, they would have at least one liberal voice to counteract all the conservatism.

I think if it gets big in the city or town that it happened, and maybe someone turns it in to a national studio,and maybe then they decide if they want to talk about it. Of course this is only my guess. Hope you find out.|`|c88406c33ed216877628e7bfcb6d5c27aa	I'm not sure, but it seems like anything involving a cute , young, white woman or child gets national attention.  Like Casey Anthony.  I feel sorry for her parents.  they have been thrust into the spotlight while they are trying to deal with a tragedy.  Also, Jon Benet Ramsey.  Her case had tons of attention, but murdered children of other races aren't talked about nearly as much.  It is not fair.|`|5BmnSiqUaa	.<br>  Cute victims and/or perps.<br>  .<br>  Period.<br>  .<br>  <br>  For example, when a white girl goes missing (Polly Klaas, Little Amber, Jon Benet, Casey Anthony et al) the country routinely goes ape!   <br>  <br>  Hmmm . . .   <br>  <br>  Makes you think no one ever abducts girls of color, doesn't it?  Oprah herself will have to be abducted by Paris Hilton and taken to The Donald's lair to match the attention!  <br>  <br>  Headline:  "OPRAH BELIEVED HIDDEN INSIDE COMB-OVER" <br>  <br>  For instance, while the 9/11 is a true tragedy, how to explain the lesser attention paid to subsequent earthquake which killed 30,000?  See above.<br>  <br>  While 8 Marines killed is newsworthy, how to explain the lack of news regarding 250 locals killed nearby?  See above.<br>  <br>  .<br>  Remember Jeffrey Dahmer?  Well, back in the day, a terrified Cambodian boy escaped from Dahmer and was running through the streets buck naked!  An Asian boy running the streets buck naked!  Thank goodness the police saw him.<br>  <br>  Then here comes the Aryan Cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer.  Says a few words to the cops.  Guess what?  They gave the meal - er - the kid back to Dahmer!   <br>  <br>  What?!  <br>  <br>  Ask yourself:  Would that have happened had the boy been a Whiter Shade of Pale?<br>  <br>  Additionally, media conglomeration is a contributing factor.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why did Marine Public Affairs Officer change colors and now works for Al-Jazeera?  See above.<br>  <br>  .
1G3XPiq3aa	When comparing Bush's tax policies to Obama's, what exactly is it you find more socialistic about Obama's?<br>  <br>  Really, the only way you can apply the term socialist to Obama is by using it the loosest possible way, and then you would also have to consider every other first world country socialist as well.|`|CmG8oTH0aa	Because its made up.

I can't think of any president ever praised by such a radical subversive group.<br>  <br>  Sam Webb, National Chair, CPUSA, writes on the web site:<br>  <a href="http://www.cpusa.org/article/articleview/1015/1/27/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpusa.org/article/articleview...</a><br>  “Just look at the new lay of the land: a friend of labor and its allies sits in the White House. Larger Democratic majorities control Congress. A feeling of renewal and hope is in the air. Public opinion polls show a high favorability rating for our new President. And the labor and people’s movement that was so instrumental to the election’s outcome, after a short holiday pause, is off and running. “|`|mno4Qd5paa	Because many people see his stimulus package as one big welfare package and it most certainly is.|`|OBwqjS8maa	Um...because he's not a socialist.|`|5z85xkfbaa	Real Americans, the General Patton Americans are.<br>  The Socialist americans, those that voted with the intent to get something for nothing obviously aren't.<br>  Real Americans have been voicing this concern since the the current occupant of the white house tossed his hat in the ring. We have been warning that this clown is out for himself and the socialist party, as all true socialists are. They proclaim "Equality for all, except me I get extras." It's just like the old Soviet Republic.<br>  Now we are seeing that he not only fosters dislike of the capitalist system he intends to chase it away with additional business taxes. He's 'Plan' is to tax the 'wealthy and the profit makers' (read BUSINESS here) to strengthen the economy. Folks I am here to tell you that his 'plan' is going to drive MORE businesses OUT of business or Overseas. The present tax liability for US business is over 40%...the Messiah is planning to increase that to over 50%..the second highest tax in the world.<br>  If you are employed by the private sector YOUR JOB is in jeopardy, Your employer MAY have to move or close the doors.<br>  That is the benefit of socialism. The ruling class sucks the life out of the working class to give to the lazy class until the working class realizes they don't need to work to get from the ruling class. pretty soon the working class no longer exists and eventually neither will the other classes. <br>  Wasn't MARX a Genius??????|`|pq3Dt5bdaa	I think they were so hot to get a black president in and make history that his beliefs were not even considered.

Can you explain it to me?”<br>  <br>  The professor replied, “I don’t have any time to explain it at my office, but if you come over to my house on Saturday and help me with my weekend project, I’ll be glad to explain it to you.” The student agreed.<br>  <br>  At the agreed-upon time, the student showed up at the professor’s house.  The professor stated that the weekend project involved his backyard pool.<br>  <br>  They both went out back to the pool, and the professor handed the student a bucket.  Demonstrating with his own bucket, the professor said, “First, go over to the deep end, and fill your bucket with as much water as you can.” The student did as he was instructed.<br>  <br>  The professor then continued, “Follow me over to the shallow end, and then dump all the water from your bucket into it.” The student was naturally confused, but did as he was told.<br>  <br>  The professor then explained they were going to do this many more times, and began walking back to the deep end of the pool.<br>  <br>  The confused student asked, “Excuse me, but why are we doing this?”<br>  <br>  The professor matter-of-factly stated that he was trying to make the shallow end much deeper.<br>  <br>  The student didn’t think the economics professor was serious, but figured that he would find out the real story soon enough.<br>  <br>  However, after the 6th trip between the shallow end and the deep end, the student began to become worried that his economics professor had gone mad.  The student finally replied, “All we’re doing is wasting valuable time and effort on unproductive pursuits.  Even worse, when this process is all over, everything will be at the same level it was before, so all you’ll really have accomplished is the destruction of what could have been truly productive action!”<br>  <br>  The professor put down his bucket and replied with a smile, “Congratulations.  You now understand the stimulus bill.”|`|wqL84O8Naa	FFS, do your own homework flunkie!|`|bn9UcokFaa	$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<br>  bankrupt...depression....poorhouse|`|800vcWLkaa	Do your own home work.

What change?  America needs leadership not politicians. Both sides are extremely out of touch with mainstream America and the problems we face. <br>  <br>  Can you say Porkulus Maximus?  That's the my name for the new Stimulus Package.  Both parties are to blame but this President is pushing it forward with all the pet projects attached to the bill.<br>  <br>  Who cares about the First Dog or the First Swingset or the First Daughter's School or the First Lady's Style?  Rubbish!  Our country needs a leader.<br>  <br>  Government enlargement and more hand outs! Why suffer the consequences of your actions when the government will bail you out?  Just ask the bank executives who received 6 figure bonus checks paid for by our tax dollars. <br>  <br>  Transparent government?  Yes it's transparent!  You see the same old politics with little to no concern for the long term wellfare of the country.  "All bills will be made public before we vote on them."  I guess if you can read 800 pages or so several hours before the vote, then this statement is true. <br>  <br>  No Lobbyists on my team?  Well look at the so called Czars and some cabinet positions.  <br>  <br>  He seems to be spending more time worring about what Bush did than taking ownership of the Presidency.  It's yours now Mr. President. The good along with the bad.  The American people really don't care who's to blame at this point.  They need a leader to step up and LEAD this country.  <br>  <br>  No change, no leadership, no path!  Just the same old DC politics.  The only thing different is that the liberals are at the helm.  Campaign promises are now distant history.  Maybe we all should vote Independent or Libertarian next election.<br>  <br>  Talk is cheap and so is our leadership in DC.  We need to vote out every office holder up for election in 2 years.  I don't care what party they are affiliated with.  Let's put new faces in DC every election until the majority of Americans are represented.  Not the minority!  Let's form the American Party to represent the vast majority of Americans who have not representation.<br>  <br>  Our President is a very charismatic individual and a great orator.  He was a junior Senator that was promoted to President of the United States by the voters of nation.  I don't know if he was ready to take on this position.  To this point, he is not doing well at all.  The first 180 days of a Presidency usually shapes the whole term.  Well, Mr. President, you have lost the first 60 days so it's time to pick it up the clock is ticking.<br>  <br>  Trust me!  I wish him well. Every decision he makes will ultimately affect me and my family!  So far, I simply don't see any progress towards a solution to this self inflicted problem.|`|5jYQbcHEaa	I think he is doing a very poor job. Why? Because he is not doing anything he said he was going to do.He has driven us even deeper in hole.All of our children and grand children are going to pay the price.He trying to take our guns away.He is going to nationalize health care.Have you ever seen Canada's health care, trust me we don't want that.He has continued to lie to our faces about earmarks.Both sides are guilty of that!!! He has talked Americans down every since hes been in office.He talks doom and gloom in front of the world then passes this huge spending bill then says everything is o.k.I just don't know when he is telling me the truth.All he has shown me is he knows how to talk other than that he is failing. Just about every person he has brought in has had problems in one way or another.I don't see any good coming out of his change.|`|qR0eiqnYaa	Well , if you go by polls, he has dropped 10 points in the first two months.  Personally I think polls can be easily skewed so I put limited faith in them.  IMO, I am against a socialistic America and it seems hes taking us down that dead end road at full speed so I would give him a big fat 0.|`|pq3Dt5bdaa	I give him an F. Because he doesn't know what he is doing. By the time he gets his cabinet filled his presidency will be over. He should be in a horror movie instead of the oval office.

bYtCfdwbaa	What's the point in breast feeding if you are not going to do it as it would be done if there were no alternative.Fact is there's more to it than supplying milk.Mother's that breast feed and follow their instincts will do what comes naturally rather than ponder the value of continuing.It's not just supply and demand,there's a bond being built,a mutual dependance and the point where that dependance is no longer needed is reached at different times for different children.I fed all my kids and let them dictate the odds.The earliest was 1 year the longest three .<br>  Actually I take that back,there is a point to short term breast feeding from a health benefit point of view but there's more to it than simply feeding them.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	I was breast fed until my sister was born when I was 4, and even then it was because I chose to because my mum warned me it would start tasting different.

Both f us were a bit embarassed by it when we were younger because it seemed strange as you normally associate it with babies. But now I don't think it's embarassing at all, if your children want to breast feed then what's the harm in it?|`|GOifC7i3aa	weird<br>  <br>  i stopped breast feeding as soon as my son got teeth<br>  <br>  when they are weaned it is not a necessary source of nourishment<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8orUaCJ0GY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8orUaCJ0...</a>|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	I think .. it's nobody else's business.|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	I agree.  It's her choice and why not?  In the developing world women are encouraged to breastfeed until 3 as it continues to have benefits for mother and child.  Not least the bonding element she clearly cherishes.<br>  <br>  I would probably have breast fed longer if I hadn't had to go back to work, but managed 7 months.|`|7B6PxDzYaa	As long as you are fully aware you are doing this to fufill YOUR OWN needs and not the child's  it is fine.  The child does not need your milk, but it does need to develope it's own identity, hence what the twosomes are all about.  There is no doubt in my mind this is about indulgence of your own ego.|`|368bc83d639169abb91831209150e22faa	I would say once they are weaned, what is the need for breast feeding?  Clearly the need of the mother, not the child, and this is clearly not appropriate.|`|vyfrNxeOaa	i think if people are comfortable them it is great.i breastfed my son until he was 19 months and i st-oped because of pressure of people around me ,and i regret it.<br>  so i think it is great she keeps on doing it .|`|4BeKVZsPaa	i was breast fed until i was 28 years old, it was a hell of a fight, but she got me off in the end.|`|kKswtGMwaa	Unnecessary in my opinion. A bit icky too.|`|4LIbHFPpaa	Not as bad as in Little Britan<br>  <br>  Ell D|`|UOybpxsfaa	Good for her I fed mine till they were nearly 3|`|PyhWvCoOaa	There is something very unnatural about this whole idea, no wonder the children of today are spineless.......they are still clinging to mummy, very sad.|`|q5viMBDPaa	Bitty|`|aIakDSstaa	its her kid she can feed it till its 5 for all I care, mums no best|`|AA10283080	One the child is old enough to ingest food on their own it's time for weaning.  <br>  There's no reason to be breast feeding a 3 year old and keeping it dependent on you unless you want it to be dependent on you for the rest of it's life. If you don't mind your child living in your basement at the age of 34 go ahead.<br>  <br>  In nature you don't see a mother animal breastfeeding it's baby after a certain time because the baby needs to grow up. Humans only prolong the weaning process in order to satisfy some need in the adult, not the baby.
7831ee550cade02d213e89fd21c1d0e1aa	The better question is when will Children Services put her kids in foster care. That woman is as stable as a juggler in an earthquake. I really hope they consider that. She should be locked up.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	When will people stop harassing a new mother who has done nothing but love her kids and is on welfare like hundreds and thousands of others? If you really care about the welfare of children I suggest you spend your time volunteering to look after children who are wards of the state, rather than advocating that these children are taken from their loving mother. Ask people who have been adopted out how they'd feel if they knew their mom had wanted them, and they'd been taken away anyway because of whiny little cows like you.|`|5z85xkfbaa	When the cute wears off and the free advertisement no longer is viewed as an asset.

wxMhNtXUaa	i think it's accept for what he did done.....|`|vl0HWTDJaa	According to UK law, when the PM is given a gift from an official of another country, he has to pay for it if he wants to keep it. So maybe Obama just thought Gordon Brown was too affected by the credit crunch to afford the renumeration of a better gift, lol. He can't have wanted the embarassment George Bush recieved when Tony Blair left that stupid Airforce jacket behind in the helicopter because he didn't want to pay for it!|`|Un3YxFvRaa	His rudeness is just that... rudeness which comes from a lack of class that money can't buy for him.   Mr. Brown shouldn't feel bad, though - Obama doesn't like America either, and he is just as rude and uncouth to the American people who don't fall down and worship him!  For example, using the middle finger during his campaign to rest on his face and daring anyone to call him on it (deliberately giving America the  finger) , and looking side to side during the National Anthem.......  <br>  <br>  But it's still embarrassing for those of us who are Americans and appreciate England and history. When obama took away Churchill's bust from the White House (which was a gift from England) and sent it back, I knew what was coming.. that he was going to show disdain for England in anyway he could.... however, that sure isn't true for the Muslim countries which he loves and by the way, gave his first, albeit, secret TV address after taking office.... he is favoring those he loves and trampling on everyone else....|`|q5viMBDPaa	You'd think the President of the United States would be able to afford a little more, that being said i don't think Gordon Brown is worth 1 DVD let alone 25!|`|xcCvaVqHaa	Oh thats a great gift. He probably even took the time to instruct somebody from the White House to download and burn them illegally.
swiOhDo2aa	Athena is right. I have worked in schools where the children's behaviour, in and out of actual lessons, simply would not be believed without CCTV evidence. <br>  <br>  Next important question: having lost the plot in our education system, how are we going to repair the damage and get back to actually teaching the kids something?|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	my son is at one of the schools involved, 'The Albion'.

I'm assuming it is a qualified teacher, therefore it would totally undermined them. Why would they need instructing if they are qualified?

JhC6BvPpaa	The pit closures were all planned meticulously with military precision by Thatcher and Ian MacGregor (boss of the NCB). I don't think the miners stood a chance the way it was all executed. Maybe in hind sight, the strike would have been better planned had they have done it earlier, and or later, and maybe had a series of strikes rather than one HUGE one. They needed far more support from the general public AND other Trade Unions, especially Notts miners, the power workers, trains, and road haulage as well as the steel workers. But at that time period, they were never going to win, whatever they did.<br>  <br>  Nottinghamshire miners needed to support the NUM rather than breaking away. The Notts pits kept producing coal, so had a negative effect on the strike.|`|35fe1a8416fedbc485116527db4594acaa	a ballot would of done for a start .Scargill with the benefit of hindsight has been shown to be woefully short ,where is he now by the way  .If a ballot was held there wouldnt of been a strike in the first place  .The previous two governments were brought down by unions (heath callaghan )and scargill was hell bent on doing it again  Thatcher knew the rest of the country knew this and she could hit them with everything ,safe in the knowlege the majority of the country would vote for her in the next election , which is what happened .The miners were led up the garden path ,and are a bad advert for blind faith|`|kJ4g1vujaa	It was pretty much a lost cause from the start since the Nottingham miners were still working and the government had so much coal stockpiled.  The miners were lured into a trap.  Communities that had well paid working men were turned into benefit dependent sink estates with a few people getting jobs in call centres etc. Its almost like Thatcher preferred to import gas from Russia rather than produce our own coal.
fWP8aBpsaa	Its not the French I'm worried about.<br>  <br>  Gas in the North Sea is running out.  Once it is gone we will rely on imports from such politically stable regions and nations as Russia and the Middle East.<br>  <br>  The Russians have now cut off mainland Europe's gas supply two times in the last 3 winters due to various spats with Ukraine.  <br>  <br>  Yet given the above we are STILL building gas fired power stations.<br>  <br>  Add to that our present Nuclear power stations are fast coming to the end of their lives - they will close around 2020 and make up 20% of our supply, and it will take many many years to force new ones through the planning system.<br>  <br>  Relying on France, who generates 80% of its electricity from Nuclear power, for energy could soon become the norm rather than exception|`|xDPQ700baa	Been happening for years. About time we built some more nuclear power stations.<br>  <br>  Look at the France to UK part on the right hand side.|`|o2H6DEHLaa	you know why? because when Blair wanted to built a  new nuclear power station nobody wanted it.<br>  nuclear power is clean and cheap to use.it should be a priority

If the green movement had been more advanced at the time they would have just loved to use global warming as an excuse.<br>  <br>  They closed them down for political reasons.<br>  <br>  Edit. Health matters aside. I know all too well what they can do to a person. My grandad was a miner, my dad was forbidden by his parents to work in the pit.<br>  <br>  The fact remains that thousands of folk were willing to do the work, but the unions were too powerful to be allowed to survive.|`|AA11049477	It would seem there maybe truth in that theory <br>  Thatcher began driving the coal-miners from the mines, to break their Unions.<br>  These unions held too much power in the UK, the government wanted that power taken away from the common man <br>  ( miners ) who could easily hold the country to ransom & they did, in the 70s.<br>  I remember black-outs.<br>  <br>  Though they don't intend to mine this coal, not in the old-fashion sense, now up-to-date technology ( what they mean is a huge digger which ) can strip-mine vast areas ( leaving huge scars on the countryside)  within a few short months & with a fraction of the people the industry used to employ, hardly jobs for life or for the many.<br>  <br>  The UK has signed up to gas from some way-off countries, pipe-lines running through some precarious areas of the world & we only have their word for it, that there's 50 years worth left!<br>  Same as the Oil companies, gas supplies lie about their reserves, too.|`|xZwwb3kVaa	They can do what they like with them, as long as men are    not driven down there to extract it.My Father died when he was forty years old with the amount of coal dust he had in his body.

Young girls nowadays think they have to look like these celebrities (not realising the pictures have been airbrushed) so will go on diets at the age of 8 to look like Kate Moss. And yes they think that if they cant look like it by doing that then plastic surgery is an easy option. They need educating but a lot of parents think that looks are everything so go along with it.|`|PXNETRAyaa	well im a preteen and i think it probably does to some extent. On the skinny issue, kids that are overweight may feel that way, while others that are happy with their weight may not. Cosmetic surgery is the same, if ur happy with the way u look then it doesn't influence u as much, for others who aren't so happy with the way they look they may feel very influenced. But for those people who are influenced, it isn't always a bad influence. Sometimes there may be a kid who hears about a celebrity getting a nose job and may think, "I hate my nose i want one too" or may think "That's crazy! Why would someone change the way God made them". There are different ways that children and teens are influenced. We tend to always look at the negative influences more though.

Girls magazines are being aimed at younger and younger age groups, and practically every page shows pictures of thin girls, wearing make up and more often than not, photo shopped. <br>  <br>  I'm only 22 now, but didn't start wearing make up until I was 15 or 16, and found this was pretty standard for people around my age. Now it's unusual for a 13 year old to go to school without make up on. And you only need to look at the trends of anorexia and bulimia to see the effect it's having on young teenagers views of a healthy weight.
