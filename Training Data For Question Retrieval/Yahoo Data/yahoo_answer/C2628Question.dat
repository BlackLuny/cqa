20090128133939AAlD3oF	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	'92 cadillac won't start. Cold weather the issue?	We took it to the mechanic and got the starter replaced and it started so we took it home and the next morning BAM, wouldn't start. The lights, radio, etc all come on and we charged the battery so its not that. We had it towed to the mechanics AGAIN. we tried to start it as we were loading it onto the tow truck but nothing. Then we here back from the mechanic that they tried it and it started w/o any problems. Reluctantly we took it back home and the next morning, well, it didn't start. Our only theory right now is that its the cold weather (we live in Michigan) and we keep it outside. We are gonna go slap a space heater by it and see if we can start it.    Any ideas as to what the issue is?

20090128145709AAMFS8u	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	Gas money, I need your opinion!?	A coworker of mine asked me if I would be able to give her a ride to and from work because she is unable to drive for a few weeks. After giving her a ride one time, she just assumes that I will continue to give her a ride...even though she stated that she had several people lined up to help take her in each day. Well I've been taking her for a few weeks already and she hasn't even offered gas money, not one time! Not that I expect her to pitch in, but at l least she could offer. I've also taken her grocery shopping twice. What do you guys think is the best way to approach this situation? I just feel like, at her age...why should I have to point out such an obvious thing!   Thanks!   I feel like i'm being used
