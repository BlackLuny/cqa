Be aware that phpbb salts the password so you will need to retrieve the salt from the user table too like this    $salt = $row['salt'];        and then hash the password that was entered to check that it is correct    if ($password == $hash=MD5(MD5($loginpassword).$salt))  {  //set those sessions  }

Never seen B before though. Rules 1 & 2 get.|`|5uFXCBpraa	First, there were huge 5 1/4 " floppy drives.  (actually, before then, there were 8" floppy drives, but almost nobody remembers those).    Then, there were smaller 3 1/2" floppy drives with more storage capacity, and greater resistance to damage.    Older PCs typically had one 5 1/4" floppy drive and one 3 1/2" floppy drive.  The 3 1/2" was A: and the 5 1/4" was B: .  Some people hooked up two 3 1/2" drives when the 5 1/4" went out of style.    DOS was set up to use C: as the bootable hard drive, with one 3 1/2" floppy drive, and (sometimes) one 5 1/4" drive.  Other hard drives typically followed C:, and other optical drives (CD drives), when they came out, followed the hard drives.    Most people never used B: , but everyone had to have an A: and a C: in order to use DOS and Windows 3.1/95.

And A went to the primary Floppy drive and B: went to the secondary.|`|lbhiu6GYaa	Drive letters A & B were used in the age when the floppy disks were used.

If the other didn't come with it then it wasn't meant to have it. Sorry.     If you intend on switching the RAM and and other add on components possibly yes, but first find the motherboard make and model and revision number, google it and you will be able to find the specs and see if the components from one can be placed on the other. Even though you included the model number they didn't all come with the exact same components, so to be safe I would research it so you don't damage the motherboards and the CPU's.|`|kfnidL8vaa	its plain simple...u cant switch a pci-e with a pci...the slots are different..it wont fit in...good day :)

But if running 3 displays is more important than the performance of the computer then yes go with the G5.  At the least get a Quad G5.

('Port' was an excellent substitute word however! It IS a port)    Yes, I concur. It more than likely is your DC Power Jack that is bad. I have had to repair many of these. The outside cylindrical metal shell of the jack, is the Negative. The post in the middle is the Positive. As you know, I'm sure, your AC adapter, (Charger), converts Alternating Current to Direct Current. DC is what your flashlight uses.    The DC Power Jack is no bigger than your thumbnail. It's approximately half a thumbnail length in height, and 3/4's of a thumbnail in length, 1/3rd thumbnail in width. The width is barely larger than the outside of the AC Adapter plug in diameter.    On the bottom of the jack are three or four leads. These are about the length of this these two letters ->aa, in these two letters combined width. They are the thickness of a flat toothpick. In the three lead design, two of the leads are Positive (+) and Negative ( - ) The other lead is put down through the motherboard, and soldered on the bottom for stability of the jack. In the four lead design, two leads are used for stability. All leads go through the motherboard, and soldered on the bottom side.    Point of all this? Sometimes the DC Power Jack is bumped with the AC adapter plug in it, and solder joints may break loose. If it is the Positive, the Negative, or both, your laptop doesn't get a charge.    Sometimes it's just a bad design, on the point of the motherboard, and laptop manufacturer. The DC Power Jack is attached to a 'peninsula' of the motherboard. This 'peninsula' sticks out away from the motherboard, and can crack the motherboard, where the peninsula meets the main body of the motherboard. When this happens, circuit traces, (Copper strips on the motherboard, is the simplest way to explain a circuit trace. They're like flat copper wires), are ripped into. No electricity flows from the DC Power Jack, to the motherboard.    Many laptops have had warranty work done to them for this problem, and the result is a change of the entire motherboard. If the laptop isn't under warranty, and if it is, it isn't covered, then this is a high cost replacement job. Around $350 or so.    (That's because you don't have to be that 'sharp' to replace a motherboard. I can teach a 9 year old kid to do that! In fact I did! I taught my nephew. It also helps stop the laptop manufacturer, to have the same problem come up again with the laptop, while still in the warranty period. If it's a bad design to begin with, the problem WILL come back!)    The DC Power Jack price ranges around $5 bucks. The labor ranges around $100 to $225.    This is because the technician, (IF you can FIND one that is a 'Tech', and still does this, and isn't a 'parts changer'!), has to take the entire laptop apart, all the way down to the motherboard itself, in hand. The old jack is de-soldered, the area cleaned, solder joints re-tinned, if necessary, and a new jack inserted. Then very precise soldering is done. The laptop is put back together, and viola!    Motherboard replacement is easier, as no precise soldering needs to be done.  If the jack's solder joints have just been broken loose, then all that is needed, is to remove the old solder joint/s, and re-solder new solder joint/s. (Yeah, LIKE it's THAT easy! lol!)    SHOULD, you find that the price of fixing the DC Power Jack, warrants NOT replacing the laptop, AND the problem is a bad motherboard/DC Power Jack design, then you might suggest to your computer tech to use this method,  http://www.insidemylaptop.com/laptop-dc-...

But if you aren't in a wifi hotspot, then you wont be able to connect to the internet.  The only way to have a connection at all times is to get a wireless service, and that will require a monthly subscription to a wireless internet provider. You have a wireless receiver that plugs into your laptop and then you can access the internet. So you will have to be in a wifi hotspot or go through a wireless internet provider.  Keep in mind that some wifi hotspots require passwords or you might have to pay.  Good Luck!

uMjVJzzaaa	You can try...    A. Repairing your network. ( Right click your connection in the bottom right hand corner and hit repair. )  B. Restarting the modem/router.|`|axoPWEo8aa	Try completely resetting your wireless router. This will remove all previous settings as if u had just bought it. Therefore if any restrictions had been put onto your I.P address they would get removed.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	This is definitely Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (even in your router's firmware - look at step 8 below). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (your brother's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     Trying MBAM alone is not enough as you need a COMPLETE solution, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean your browser    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|5uFXCBpraa	-Try installing Google Chrome.  Maybe Internet Explorer is screwing up somehow.    -See if you can Ping the sites.    -A router can be set to block sites.  Try resetting it.    -Maybe someone installed a program that blocks porn sites, and the program went out of control and blocked a bunch of unrelated websites.  Check to see if any porn blockers are installed.
2yl8omcAaa	First thing is you will need to back up your email contacts before you can move it.    If you are using exchange emails accnt, msn, yahoo, google etc you do not need to do that back up.. All you need is to login and you are done.    If you are using outlook email then you need to back up your email first to a USB, CD-R or External hard drive before you can move them.    To do this, Access the location of your data files(outlook). In the main menu, you can either click File > Data File Management... or Tools > Account Settings - then click the data files Highlight the personal folder with the OUTLOOK.PST file that you are interested in backing up and click on the "Open Folder..." icon. Clicking on this icon will automatically launch Windows Explorer and take you to the location where this data file is stored such as SD, USB drive, external hardrive etc..    NOTE: outlook needed to be closed before the backup will start.    I hope this helps :)|`|5d10867c48069bdd586d3ac760f8a73faa	you can put them on a USB or an external hard drive if they're files. if you're talking about an e-mail account, then you don't need to transfer anything.

The idea is that when a person willingly clicks on the advertisements, they are taken to that site, and the company that posted the advertisement send some money to the website manager who posted the advertisement on their webpage. This can be a small amount of money per each click, however if you have ever googled something, you will quickly realize how easy it is for someone to click on a advertisement without realizing it. Just take some time to look around at some webpages. They all run off of the same idea.Facebook makes money from advertisement and applications. Some applications will grab your information and then sell it......thus profit for them and they send some of that stuff to Facebook for compensation.    Hope that helps. :)

You should never delete pictures on a Mac by just simply rebooting.  I would be really scared if that was happening to you.    What you could try is to do a repair using the installer disc rather than a full re-install.  That might fix whatever issues you're having without destroying everything.    But if you have to do a full re-install, then no, you're going to wipe the entire drive.  So you need to backup the pictures and music to another drive. If you use it doing Time Machine then you can re-install all the software from scratch and just recover your personal files (ie the pictures and music).  But you need an external drive first.|`|XlyLakYAaa	"Reboot" just means to restart the computer:  http://www.thefreedictionary.com/reboot    So just shutdown->Restart and you're done.

The same can be done as well for your standalone sound card if you can determine what it is, but if it is an older machine windows should already have a driver that should work for it.

MvnfQ5B0aa	YouTube accepts a wide range of video file formats. This list is all the video files YouTube will accept. Some video formats work best and are most compatible with certain computers, software or devices.        * Windows Media Video(.avi)      * .3GP (cell phones)      * .AVI (windows)      * .MOV (mac)      * .MP4 (ipod/psp)      * .MPEG      * .FLV (adobe flash)      * .SWF (shockwave flash)      * .MKV (h.264)    But yet not uploaded then you have to convert most any video format to one of the aforementioned accepted formats it is reccommended you use FFMPEG. FFMPEG is a command-line tool, so newer users may like to use the free tool, SUPER. If you do not produce acceptable results with these tools, you may also try the commercial software, Magic Video Converter.    hopefully it would help you.

Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???

vDPCNimoaa	You probably aren't going to get much useful answers here because nobody really knows how to work it except the few rare people who actually are able to get it to work. Go here http://www.insanelymac.com/ for a forum and ask for support on something that doesn't work or you are having problems because people probably won't help you with something as general as installing it, there are so many different steps.     My suggestion? DON'T try it unless you are really experienced, which im guessing you aren't because you need help to just "install" it. Hp computers are hard to manage with the boot, i've had trouble installing Windows Xp, Windows 7, and kalyway(this never worked). There were so many steps until I figured out just how to install software from microsoft, how hard do you think it would be to install cracked software not meant to even work on anything other than apple computers? I'm not trying to be mean or anything, who knows? Your computer might be the lucky one and work, but from my past experience, i've tried 11+ different dvds from different versions and none of them worked no matter what I did to try installing it (reseting boot, unpluggin devices, etc...) I eventually gave up because no matter what I did, it would not boot (stupid hp machine). Even if it did install, you would have trouble with driver compatibility (most people couldn't connect to internet), printers wouldnt work, graphic drivers would probably not install, sound wouldn't work, keyboards/mice, etc..  But... I hope you have better luck than me if you attempt it, good luck.|`|bvqz8Xh5aa	You probably want to be here - http://forum.insanelymac.com/index.php?s...

Buy a Sony, Toshiba, Dell, or Acer. Any of these brands with similar specs to that eMachine will do all the things you list just fine. Basically, look for at least 2gb RAM and around a 2gHz processor. The hard drive is up to you, most computers come with 160 or 250gb. Here's an option I just found on Newegg, but you should definitely shop around and find one that really suits your tastes and preferences.    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...      To get internet access, you need to either have a wireless router such as this one:    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...

Ob1TQcOAaa	wi fi is wireless internet|`|Cfw0OvLwaa	Wi-fi is short of Wireless Fidelity.Means radio frequency wireless networking standards are specified by IEEE 802.11 committees.     When you implement a radio frequency wireless network, you use radio waves rather than wires to connect your hosts. Radio waves are considered unbounded media because, unlike wires, they have nothing to encase them. The most commonly used frequency for wireless networking is the 2.4 GHz frequency.    Wireless standard :  802.11a Frequency: 5.75 - 5.85 GHz, Speed 54 Mbps  802.11b Frequency: 2.4 - 2.4835 GHz, Speed 11 Mbps  802.11g Frequency: 2.4 - 2.4835 GHz, Speed 54 Mbps    For more information visit this link below:  http://yosellin.blogspot.com/2008/12/we-...  http://yosellin.blogspot.com/2008/12/way...    regards  http://yosellin.blogspot.com/|`|psk4aPvuaa	The purpose of Wi-Fi is to provide inter-operable wireless access between devices.

044IeGstaa	Let's take an example, and let me make a correction.  It's PC6400, for DDR2 Sdram that operates at 800MegaHertz (MHz)    This 800MHz rating, stands for the Frequency Rate of the ram memory.  Mega = approximately 1 Million. Hertz stands for 'Cycles per Second'.  So this ram's frequency rate, is approximately 800 Million Cycles per Second.    The designation can be stated as PC2, or just PC, if combined with the right last four numbers.     Stating PC2-6400, and PC6400 are both correct. It's just like I say,  TOE-Mahto, and you say TOE-Mato.    Ram timing is your CAS Latency. The lower the numbers, the better. This is because ram timing, represents how fast the ram data (Information) is replenished. I know that doesn't make any sense to you right now, but I feel after looking at the next few links, it will.  1.http://computer.howstuffworks.com/ram.ht...  2.http://computer.howstuffworks.com/ram7.h...  3.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas_latency  4.http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/2...    (DDR2 Sdram -> SO-DIMM     Edit: You can't use ram memory that operates at 1333MHz, on a motherboard with an 800MHz Front Side Bus (FSB)  It won't work! NOT, will slow the ram memory down, and simply work at 800MHz, it won't work PERIOD!|`|BgwTxzEFaa	The 533, 667, etc is the bus speed.  Get one that matches the speed you are replacing.    If you look at the memory you are replacing, there should be a sticker on it with the speed.|`|jE7FLQY1aa	The 3 digit number is the speed in MHz. Obviously the higher the better, but this number is limited by the FSB speed of your motherboard. i.e. if you're using 1333MHz ram on a board with a FSB of 800MHz, I believe the ram is capped at 800.    Are you running the 2 gig stick with another 2 gig? Dual channel configuration will run faster. For example, two 1 gig sticks in dual channel configuration is faster than a single 2 gig stick. That's if your laptop supports dual config.|`|NdC2s0F5aa	The real answer to your problem is Crucial.com, it will tell you what ramsticks you currently have, and how much ram you can upgrade maximum.

AIqgmEB0aa	The Facebook terms do not allow this to happen (for anything, including, but not limited to, pictures, videos, and the profile page itself). ie. Facebook does not allow users to track profile views or see statistics on how often a particular piece of content has been viewed and by whom.    There have been several applications that have claimed to do this in the past, but they either didn't work or were removed by facebook for violating its privacy terms.    Third party developers, however, may offer applications that provide some of this functionality, subject to the following terms:      1. Applications cannot track profile views for users who simply visit another person's profile. Facebook has made this technically impossible.  2. In order to be tracked by an application, you must explicitly agree to allow the application to access your information.  3. Adding an application that provides this functionality is purely optional. If you do not want to participate, please do not add the application to your account.    Unlike myspace, Facebook's philosphy is to let users view what they want without others knowing what they viewed.    So you can check out that cute guy/girl with no worries about them finding out, but unfortunately you will not be able to find out who has been viewing yours.|`|bVZ7uZjJaa	No - it is not possible.

FbjRnvdAaa	Exactly. in order to do it, i would use Microsoft outlook as an example.    To enable POP in Gmail:       1. Sign in to Gmail.     2. Click Settings at the top of any Gmail page.     3. Click Forwarding and POP/IMAP.     4. Select Enable POP for all mail or Enable POP for mail that arrives from now on.     5. Choose the action you'd like your Gmail messages to take after they are accessed with POP.     6  click Save Changes.    Now you need to configure your email client    Open Outlook.   Click the Tools menu, and select E-mail Accounts...   Click Add a new e-mail account, and click Next.   Choose POP3 as your server type by clicking the radio button, and click Next.   Fill in all necessary fields to include the following information:        User Information      Your Name: Enter your name as you would like it to appear in the From: field of outgoing messages.      Email Address: Enter your full email address (username@gmail.com or username@your_domain.com)        Server Information      Google Apps users, enter the server names provided, don't add your domain name in this step.      Incoming mail server (POP3): pop.gmail.com      Outgoing mail server (SMTP): smtp.gmail.com        Login Information      User Name: Enter your Gmail username (including @gmail.com). Google Apps users, enter your full address in the format username@your_domain.com      Password: Enter your email password  Click More Settings... and then click the Outgoing Server tab.  Check the box next to My outgoing server (SMTP) requires authentication and select Use same settings as my incoming mail server.  Click the Advanced tab, and check the box next to This server requires an encrypted connection (SSL) under Incoming Server (POP3).  Check the box next to This server requires an encrypted connection (SSL) under Outgoing Server (SMTP), and enter 465 in the Outgoing server (SMTP) box.  Click OK.  Click Test Account Settings... After receiving Congratulations! All tests completed successfully, click Close.  Click Next, and then click Finish.  Download the latest updates for Outlook from Microsoft. This will help prevent the most common Outlook errors Gmail users see.    Congratulations! You're done configuring your client to send and retrieve Gmail messages.     Now click send and receive and download all you gmail messages.   Next use the export function of the Outlook to export all you emails to a file and then burn that file to a CD. Here are the steps on how to export all you emails:       1.  On the File menu, click Import and Export.     2. Click Export to a file, and then click Next.     3. In the list, click Personal Folder File (.pst), and then click Next.     4. Click the folder that contains the messages you want to back up. If the folder contains a subfolder that you want to include, select the Include Subfolders check box, and then click Next.     5. Under Save exported file as, click Browse, and then specify a name and location for your backup file, for example, Mail Backup.     6. If you back up a .pst file that you have backed up to before, click one of the following:          Replace duplicates with items exported  Existing data will be overwritten with the information in the file being exported.          Allow duplicate items to be created  Existing data will not be overwritten, and duplicate information will be added to the backup file.          Do not export duplicate items  Existing data will be kept, and the duplicate information in the folder will not be copied to the backup file.     7. Click Finish.|`|affbe5008ef24169fc91cd83c735213eaa	Create a new Email Id and Fowar all ur mails to Them ...

As the iSight camera is such a basic/consumer level thing, I don't think it does.  From this, I think it only happens as an error, not intentionally,  http://support.apple.com/kb/TA23752?view...    For your render problem, that means that your sequence settings are not set right.  You need your the codec of your sequence setting to match the codec of the video files you are trying to cut onto the timeline.  You can scroll through the browser (left to right) and look for the column that says the compressor type.  Then you can find out what type of compressor/codec the video file is.  Then go into the sequence settings and make sure the sequence is the same.    Honestly, you need to get the Apple Pro Training Series book.  FCE is a little too robust to just learn it from a few tips on Yahoo! forums or anywhere else.  You need some serious tutorials.

The whole point of a laptop is its portability, and if it can't hold much of a charge then it's not as useful. If the price were something like $450 then it would be a good deal, but for $800 that is terrible.     Here is a MacBook for $949 with a one year warranty and everything on it works perfectly.

Have fun surfing the internet Erik while I use my pc for real stuff =)     also how are they garbage pc if they have better specs.... i mean if you really wanted to you could put osx on it... and still have a better computer than that apple... id love to see you answer that erik    "oh yah" brought up some really good points... with all honesty I know people with macs and they work fine for the basic stuff but really they are nothing special they are actually bellow standard and people really bought into the vista sucks thing... its not a bad opperating system its just when people try to upgrade there old computers to vista.. Its like trying to make something better that cant be better... I would really really consider buying a pc.. you wont regret it and the companies will actually honor there warranty .. also note that toshibas are great computers I highly recommend them.|`|2mbiQfSmaa	i don't know dude you can get a brand new one starting at 999.

Otherwise, you need a cross compiler. Use Google. I think GCC can be configured to do that.|`|fE7zhp3Caa	Not that I know of.  From what I understand, the architecture and OS you code and compile on is the one that it runs on.  If you need the program to run on another OS you have to migrate the code yourself and compile it on that OS.    You might be able to compile a Win32 compatible program within Wine, but I don't think it would work very well because Wine only emulates Windows and my experience with Wine wasn't very encouraging.

That is teh reason you have Kaspersky Internet Security and not Kaspesky Anti virus.  Internet Security programs have anti virus, anti spyware, firewall and lots more.   Also you should not have more than one anti virus programs on your computer. I thought first, that ZoneAlarm Pro with Antispyware also had an anti virus. I was wrong.

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Well, you obviously do NOT understand the difference between a cable connection and a DSL connection. Think of DSL as the hub of a LAN with each user having a separate connection to the hub, just like what you may have in your house, star topology.. What YOU do with your connection does NOT affect any other user since you are the only user on your line and your ISP who controls the hub also controls your bandwidtjh, just as they do with every other user. Cable, however, is a single wire and everyone is all on one BIG party line. The problem with a party line is only one user can "talk" at a time, though all can listen. Everyone who wants to "talk" has to wait until the other person stops before they can try to get a turn. First come, first serve, one at a time and all others have to wait. That rate you see is theoretical only, and is accurate if you were the ONLY user on the cable. Once a second user starts up, you split the available bandwidth, so your throughput is half advertised. The more users, the lower the throughput for each individual user. Cable takes much less hardware for the provider as they have only one modem at the head end instead of a single dsl modem for each user connection. So, even though cable is advertised as faster, and it IS under certain circumstances so technically they are not lying, MOST of the time it is slower because of the other users sharing the max bandwidth, something the cable company conveniently does NOT tell you, though they DO say your bandwidth may not be as fast as they say under certain circumstances which remain unspecified. The more user machines on cable the worse it gets, yet they charge the same, thus making cable a huge cash cow compared to DSL. Also, there is the subject of servers. Cable companies for the most part restrict servers. If you have cable, I'll bet the user agreement for cable service forbids you setting up a server (or a peer to peer network like Gnutella or Limewire) on your connection because the server can hog bandwidth making all of the other users suffer. Whereas on DSL, a server (or peer to peer network) hogging your bandwidth is no problem for any other user other than your machines in your own home. NOW, you know why I have DSL instead of cable...At least I have the option to run a server if I want to...

Finish editing the entire video first (except the part with the picture, obviously). Then publish it as a video file and download a freeware program that rips sound from video files. Just google for it, you'll find one. Use that to rip the sound from the video (preferably to a .wav, but an mp3 might work too) and save it to your computer. Then go back to your video in moviemaker and cut out the portion where you want the graphic to be. Add the picture you want to use in the space you cut out. Now import the sound file you made as the music track. Mute the sound on the video you already have so it doesn't mess it up.     Assuming you made the picture the EXACT same length as the amount you cut from the video, everything should sync up.    If you have any questions let me know. :)

When compiler gets to s.add(89) it sees that a is declared as a generic TreeSet and therefore anything can go on it. so no problem adding an int into a generic TreeSet.  However, when you try to do the same thing with s1 which is declared as a String TreeSet it will yell at you that you shouldn't add an int into a String TreeSet.  So everything is checked against the declared type at compile time . if they pass great, but still you might have problems at runtime when you don't use a value in a generic type as the type it really is and initialized as.   working with generic TreeSets is risky as you must know each element's type to be safe, so the best way to declare and initialize a non-generic TreeSet is like :  TreeSet  s1=new TreeSet();  the declared type and the dynamic type agree and the compiler will yell at you if you don't follow the type.|`|K1prVAsjaa	If you declare an array variable and then assign an array of strings to it, you still just have an array variable. If you declare an array of strings variable and then assign an array to it, you still have an array of strings variable.    In other words, when you declare the variable, the way you declare it determines how the JVM interacts with it. Assigning a specific sub-type doesn't change how the JVM sees it.    BTW, I believe the  type cast in your example is C++ syntax, not Java, so I'm  not sure how it can compile as Java. The correct syntax for Java type casting is (String).

If I were you, i'd make your own computer.    I'd select,    The PSU (Power Supply Unit)  RAM (Random Access Memory)  Hard-Drive (Amount of Storage 160gb +)  Motherboard (The main circuit board that everything connects to; choosing it yourself makes it more compatible with more ram and other addons)  Fans (Fan location, size and speed)  Graphics Card (Graphics Card helps you run games smoothly, 400+mb of ram in the graphics card is good)    The rest can be average.    You select the pieces, they make it.    Good luck!

fE7zhp3Caa	First clear CMOS settings and reboot so BIOS can detect the CPU again.  Some systems I've worked with retain old settings even when they're supposed to automatically detect proper CPU settings on their own.    If it's still wrong after that, enter CMOS setup and look for options concerning the FSB, specifically anything that might say 'manual' with 166 under or beside it.  See if you can change the 'manual' to 'auto' or 'CPU default'.  Otherwise you may be able you manually set the FSB to 200 and go from there.    Only after you've tried these things to no effect do you want to flash BIOS.  If anything goes wrong or the process is interrupted you could effectively cut the brain out of your board and then it won't work properly without physically replacing the BIOS chip.    The process for flashing BIOS can vary from one chip maker to another, but usually you're given a BIOS image file in binary format (BIN) and a flash utility that you copy to floppy disk, boot from, and tell it where to find the BIOS update.  Sometimes you can write the BIOS update to a floppy disk using a program like RAWRITE or RAWRITENT and booting from it does all the work in one go.    Most newer motherboards have BIOS update utilities that run inside Windows, so all you need is the utility and the location of the BIN file containing the update.  Run the update, reboot your computer, and it's done.    Either way, you need to follow the BIOS manufacturer's instructions to get it to work.|`|omNEQ4Tkaa	what is your operating system it sounds like you still are in bios default settings have you loded latest drivers for xp from asus website?

They are the best laptop providers that you will be looking for.

AA11542500	I'm assuming you have a broadband modem and a wireless router so let's start up from the beginning.    1. Unplug your cable or dsl modem.    2. Connect your modem to your wireless router.     3. Connect your laptop to the router. You need to configure it wired first to enable wireless later.    4. Power on your modem and let it cycle...usually a minute.    5. Power on your router and let it cycle...usually a minute.    6. Turn on your computer. It'll take a minute after booting to recognize the new network.    7. Check to see if your network is good. Go to Start => Run => type in CMD and hit enter.    8. Type ipconfig and hit enter. It should give you your ip address of your laptop and a gateway address. If those are available then your network is good to go and all you have left is to configure the wireless portion.    9. Open up IE and enter the ip address of your router. D-link puts it on the label on the router.    10. There shouldn't be a password yet, you should set it though. This is for accessing the router functions not wireless properties.    11. Setting up your wireless router.    12. Do this in advanced mode or non-automatic mode. Forget the CD.    13. Create an SSID, name your network and check whether you want it to be visible to others or not.    14. Set security. WEP is ok but WPA-WSK is much more secure. Create a password and then save your settings. The router will reboot.    15. Unplug your laptop from the roouter and make sure your laptop's wireless capabilities are enabled.    16. The wireless network should be detected if you set the router to broadcast otherwise you have to manually setup the network.    17. If it's detected, all you have to do is enter the password you created and hit enter.    18. If you did not set the router to broadcast you'll have to do it manually by going into the wireless networks tab and enter the SSID and password and once done will make the connection.    You're done. Enjoy your wireless connection.|`|b299160bde102239fc74ef2b56c040caaa	first thing to do is connect your computer to the router with a cable. that's the blue one with an r45 plug on each end. once you've established that you can get a connection disconnect the cable.  there are so many things that could be wrong its hard too pin point one . try right clicking the icon that says local only and go through the wizard to find a wireless connection

mOAY4FbJaa	Without the use of additional programs, your best bet is to go into your System Properties and disable most, if not all, of Windows XP's visual effects.  Some of these can bog down a slower machine, or just prevent you from doing what you want as quickly as you would like.  Be sure also that you run Windows' built-in Disk Cleanup and Disk Defragmenter to optimize hard drive space and to make sure your files are stored as contiguously as possible.    The link below discusses some great ways to get the most out of XP and contains a number of tricks you can use within XP to improve its performance without any special programs.  Be sure to read the whole page; there are MANY great programs that can be had for completely free, should you decide to try some out.  But if you want some quick and dirty tricks to simply optimize Windows XP, this site should fit the bill.  You'll get the best of both worlds on this site.  The only thing on there that I truly disagree with is that there are no free disk defragmenters that are better than the built-in defragmenter; if you decide to download a defragmenter and not use Windows' built-in defragmenter (which most experts agree is simply not sufficient), then seek out either the free version of Ultimate Disk Defrag (the newest version is commercial), or the completely free JkDisk.  Both are excellent defragmenting tools that can be had for nothing.    I hope this helps.

If you don't get that question, watch the initial boot screen for the key to press to enter BIOS or Settings or whatever they call it. Once inside, you can find an option to configure the boot device order. Make CD/DVD drive go before hard drive. This just means, on every reboot, computer will check CD/DVD drive for a bootable CD; if it finds it, it will ask you if you want to boot from CD; if it doesn't find it, then it goes to next boot device on the list, typically your hard drive.... So it is no big deal to make this adjustment

So, someone from that website can definitively trace without too much difficulty to some degree of accuracy. But let's say they know only your public IP at ISP side.

Ok so the first line add this :     include    and before 'return 0 ' put this :  getchar() ;     Make sure spelling is correct         include   include   using namespace std;    void func1()  {  cout   cout  }    void func2()  {  cout   cout   }    int main()  {  func1(); // First call to first function  func1(); // Second call to first function    func2(); // First call to second function  func2(); // Second call to second function    getchar();     return 0;  }        Good luck!|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	nothing is wrong with it, it's just fast ;)|`|F2tCkAlAaa	delete the following code from the above two lines  cout|`|bb934e69e05c392a2b53f8c500208562aa	It's been awhile since i did some C++ is there suppose to be an open bracket before the first void function and a closing bracket after the last closing bracket?|`|kGpsbmHHaa	if that's your only problem, then you could try putting this line before the last bracket:    getch();    this line will make the program wait for you to press a key before closing the screen quickly so you can view the output. hope i helped!!!
QYPrM3GPaa	That's a killer price for the i7 920 BTW.  Looking at your prices, this seems to be pretty fair for what you are wanting to purchase.  You did not mention, however, if you are putting Vista on this computer...or XP.  In any case, you are going to need a 64 bit operating system to really take advantage of more than 2 cores and 4 gigs of memory - otherwise you are just building a very overpowered computer which is not taking advantage of the full hardware capacity.    I do want to warn you, that installing a 64 bit operating system (such as Vista 64 bit) will drive you absolutely NUTS!  You CANNOT install unsigned drivers in Vista 64 bit - so make darn sure you locate all your drivers FIRST and make sure they are CERTIFIED drivers or WHQL or you will run into all kinds of nightmares.    I took the leap to 64 bit and Vista Home Premium is really cool...and I happen to like it, after sticking with XP Pro for a long time.  However, the certified driver business was a nighmare - I finally got around it with some hardware changes and now I am running a Quad Core and taking full advantage of it.  So if you are going to actually do an i7, I suggest you consider a 64 bit platform.  Just remember the problem with signed drivers, ok?|`|Ev6WQRmzaa	Looks like a pretty wicked machine.  It will smoke pretty much any prebuilt computer out there    Pink RAM is kinda girly, though :-P    Edit:  I'd probably go with Vista x64 since it has directx10 support and will make better use of that hardware.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...

GqfEYnpsaa	HP will sell you one for 15 dollars.|`|oOPLEUyNaa	No,  Best Buy or Walmart will not have operating system for older hardware.  They will be happy to sell you a copy of Vista.  Most computer assemblers (manufactures) have not shipped recovery disk for a while, they are on the hard drive.  Most will let you burn a DVD and CDs to use for recovery in the event the computer's operating system needs to be reinstalled.    Are you certain your hard drive is working?    If you have an older computer, maybe the assemblers (manufactures) can still sell you a set of recovery disks.  That is only a phone call to verify.  There are several companies that can make a set of disks from the originals consumer disks that have collected.    You could have a friend or neighbor download Mepis 7 or Puppy 4.0 and burn a CD for you.  These are Linux distros that have excellent hardware recognition, and if you have a very old computer that does not have a modern graphic card then Puppy has many video drivers to test if it does not find the right driver when you boot from CD.    Both of the linux distro can be run from CD, they do not require you to have a hard drive in your computer.  Puppy will run in 64 megs of memory, and Mepis requires 256 megs of memory.    I only suggest these Linux operating systems to check and see if your computer hardware is still good.  They are free operating systems and come with a good amount of software that will perform similar tasks that Windows XP or Vista was able to accomplish.    A very old system may not run Windows XP and certainly not Vista and using a Linux operating system may provide that hardware with new life since win 98 is no longer supported, and you can not get Anti-virus and malware scanners, or printers for the obsolete/discontinued Microsoft operating systems.

elhRdmuFaa	Basically you have generate revenue one way or another. Many open source projects have dual licenses. I don't know about now, but before Sun bought MySQL they had two licenses. If you planned to use MySQL on a commercial website you had (were supposed) to buy a commercial license. Otherwise you could install and use it for free on personal websites, or if you planned to release it into another open source project. If you don't generate revenue by licensing the product, then you have to generate the revenue another way. Many open source projects are sponsored by big companies such as Novell, Sun, or IBM. The developers get paid very well by the sponsors. Other companies such as RedHat sell their product stating that you are not paying for the product itself; you are paying for technical support. This is probably the most common way profitable open source projects generate revenue. Give the product away and charge for technical support.    I don't think the open source model would work for Microsoft. They have a very large R&D budget, and need revenue to sustain it. How often do you call Microsoft for technical support? Not very often. You need to have people renewing their support contracts yearly to base your revenue off support. Patches and service packs from Microsoft are delivered through Windows update free of charge. You don't need to support contract to keep your system up to date.    Microsoft has released several items as open source such as WiX which is a program that creates MSI installers from XML. WTL or the Windows Template Library is also on Source Forge.    Some claim that open source projects are better, because everyone can see the code and fix bugs and contribute. I don't see a correlation between bugs and open source versus closed source. I see just as many security updates weekly on Fedora, if not more, than I do on Windows update. It can also be difficult to get your contribution into the repository for an open source project.    Basically I like them both. I think both open and closed source have their places. It is always nice to see an application, wonder how they did something, and be able to view the source to improve your skills and expand your knowledge. At the same time, it would be pretty awful if I spent five years working on a product, open sourced it, and could not pay my bills.|`|3LmXfFoBaa	open source is ok but you make more money with a closed source system    that is why microsoft avoids it|`|SbAgNCm0aa	I think the over all quality of products would drastically decrease if everything was open source, there would be very little money to pay developers and programmers.     My opinion is that Microsoft's OSs, for example, should be instead much cheaper, say $50, instead of starting at $100. Its too hard to build a cheap windows machine with the OS costing that much.     Also, Apple should sell full versions of OS X so people dont have to hack it anymore.|`|bbf8f564d5e1675db8cb7cbcc84b0bebaa	For.    But I may be biased since I get paid by clients to customize/develop/write open source code.    I don't foresee MS going open source, it doesn't really fit their business model of essentially pushing out beta level software and charging customers for it and by the time they've patched it enough to be relatively stable they release a newer version ad nauseum. Besides if they open sourced their OS it might end up getting cleaned up enough that it could very well kill the virus/AntiVirus/malware market, and we can't have that can we?

Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|tVWWL9KTaa	Antivirus 2009 is an unwanted program, from the authors of Antivirus 2008 .

Not sure what OS your using Vista ah XP well do the remove program routine and this time use your windows explorer and delete the directory where AntiVirus2009 was built also remove from your desktop if you saved the download there and extracted or ran the program from your desktop..   If you really need more help I am sure theres plenty of people that will assist you removing this Antivirus2009.. My suggestion is to know who your sources are before you open or down load anything from the internet and under no cirrcumstances click on any active links unless you are absolutely sure who this link and what the link will do... if you want to check out links highlight the link and open a fresh interbrowser window paste the link in this window now you have a much better chance of controlling the outcome if the link goes south and starts asking personal info delete it by closing the active window...    Personally I believe anyone that has access to the internet should recieve minium training in internet security before they are allowed to purchase any computer or register their computer online.. and they recieve some idenity registration that they can verify who they are.. enough of the cloak and dagger stuff..It's really sad how some think they can abuse,profit,or extort from others..Peace be with you..|`|29FXdpV3aa	Antivirus 2009 is a rogue anti-spyware program.

n7UCMIFLaa	I've been through this before.  Your computer has a virus and/or trojans.  AVG can't update, you probably can't put your computer into safemode or restore.  Even if you're able to remove the virus the damage to your o/s is done.  If your computer came with a cd, put it in and reinstall windows, there may be an option to repair.  If your computer didn't come with a cd then you would have a recovery partition on your computer - go to Start>Programs>System Recovery (there's a recovery option with the cd also).  With recovery your windows will be reinstalled back to when you first got the computer & will back up all your files & folders.  You would then have to scan your computer because the virus (it will be dormant for awhile) will be found in the backup files.  You will also have to update your windows.    Good luck.
FBQZ06vraa	You change that by changing the Paragraph style from Heading 1 or so to a non-Heading paragraph style.  Do this:    1. Click in the heading.  2. Click the Format->Styles and Formatting menu item.  3. A sidebar will pop up, and the style of that paragraph will have a box around it.  Select a different style and it will replace the current style.    Hope that helps.

AA10302940	Blowfish is good, but not great. The 64-bit block version is now considered to be too short. But it's still going to take some solid effort to break it and still worthwhile in many opinions.

If you really, really need the best security, use something else, like AES with a bigger key size.  If the key is generated from a passphrase, it is likely much easier for someone to guess that than to break the encryption.

FBQZ06vraa	Those are borders attached to one of the adjacent paragraphs.  Here's how to get them:    In versions of Word prior to Word 2007:    1. Click in the paragraph you want the line(s) on.  You can put lines both above and below the same paragraph, and they don't have to be the same style or weight.  2. Click the Format->Borders and Shading menu item.  3. Select a Style, Color and Width from those list boxes.  4. Click in the Preview diagram where you want the line to appear.  5. If you want both over- and under-borders, repeat steps 3 and 4.  6. Click OK.    In Word 2007:    1. Click the Home tab on the Ribbon.  2. Click in the paragraph you want the line(s) on.  You can put lines both above and below the same paragraph, and they don't have to be the same style or weight.  3. In the Paragraph group, click on the Borders icon in the lower right corner and select Borders and Shading from the menu.  4. Continue as in Step 3, above.

BEQDqLeoaa	You can't run both routers from same phone socket by any means.  But you have option to up-link wireless router with non-wireless router. For this you need a standard cat 5e cable with RJ-45 connector. Plug one end of this cable into Ethernet port of wireless router and another end into non-wireless router. Just make sure that IP class range and subnet mask are same for both routers and it will work.

kJK1h0KMaa	I don't know what Encarta is, but I think I can solve your problem. The reason that you cannot upload a folder is that a folder is a directory. If you were able to upload a folder, you would be creating a directory on your in.com domain, which must not be allowed by Encarta.    Anyways, your solution would be to compress your folder into a .zip file or a .rar file. These filetypes are able to store folders in a compressed single file.    If you have windows, you can download WinRar here:  http://www.rarlab.com/rar/wrar380.exe    If you have mac, just right-click (?-click) your folder and click "Create Archive."    You can then upload your created .zip or .rar file.|`|HYk5jhnqaa	make a ZIP or RAR archive of that folder, then try to post it again|`|df69562ab23e3b5c7e250b6264e76a57aa	Zip it ....  it will be uploaded....|`|Dg7fEd41aa	use  winrar or winzip to zip the file  and post it

djmu98oUaa	Choosing a logo can be a difficult, complex task. Quality, fashion and purpose must be reflected in the logo design. These three points must be kept in mind to build a logo that serves your business.   I know a company its name is "LogoGuru" providing alot of packages i think you should take a visit on the site.I am giving you website link which is given below
Xjha1jiaaa	Some companies practice a loss-leader strategy where they offer a product at a loss to entice customers to buy related services. You should be careful of companies that do this as often you will spend more money in the long run.    Logo Design has a different set of prices than web design. With graphic design, there are less factors to account for. Quality web designers focus on their customer's needs and research their market so that the site they develop will be well worth the cost. This type of service tends to cost more, and nothing other than the client doing most of the work themself can reduce the cost. At most, you might get a bare-bones 3-5 page website for $200, even then it will be a loss-leader strategy which counts on you needing to spend much more money in the long run to get what you want.    If you want a quality design/website then you need to check out http://www.rexibit.com|`|djmu98oUaa	There are many logo design companies from which logos can be easily obtained...I know such a great company its name is "LogoGuru" providing alot of packages i think you should take a visit on the site.I am giving you website link which is given below|`|dF1L80rlaa	Uhm you could try- http://cooltext.com/Logos I am not sure if its free but give it a try.|`|Mkj6qQjLaa	Most common logo design service that is in the price range of $ 100-200...     A cheap web design template costs around 50 bucks.. + you have hosting and domain expenses ( 60 bucks )... + you have some more working hours and configuring...  Altogether - more expensive than the logo itself.    So ... probably we are talking about fraud...  or you just remembered wrong - a lot of webdesign studios will make a "free logo" for your website or webservice, if you order a website from their "gold package" or something :)

Now If you want to share internet on all the systems through this network, you will have to buy a cheap modem which you will connect to the LAN switch where all devices are connected. Now buy a pci lan card and install it on the XP pc, now assign dynamic ip settings to this lan card on xp and connect it directly to the modem which is connected to DSL or internet. Now assign dynamic ip settings to all other devices which are connected to the LAN switch.    Now you can connect to the internet and also connect to all other devices including the server which has XP on it.    If you want to give restrictions on the users who are connected to the internet and network, install CCproxy on your xp system (server) and remove the wire which is coming from the modem to the LAN switch.

oW4zYrtfaa	I asked this question a lot of times in the air many years ago but technically, there is no such direct answer. You have to take it one step at a time. I agree w/ Rina about w3schools.com but everything will depend on your skills. It needs time and dedication, effort and perseverance.    Computer Science, or multimedia arts if you want to go to school. But for me it is much better to spend your time w/  your computer and tinker with it. Designs? Go play with your adobe photoshop, google tutorials and play some more.    Web apps, learn PHP, w3schools will be a good start for that. Learn to install WAMP (windows-based, apache, mysql, and PHP), or LAMP (linux-based, apache, mysql and PHP). So you can practice, learn how to run websites.    For phone apps, it will depend with what type of phone you wanna tinker with. Before, JAVA is widely use.    Anyways, it will all fall that you need to learn programming.|`|bb934e69e05c392a2b53f8c500208562aa	there are numerous web design apps with tutorial on how to work with it.

And is it a 10MHz switch, a 100MHz switch, or a gigabit switch?<br>  <br>  Chances are your switch is much faster than your actual internet connection, in which case the delay that comes from the switch having to receive a packet completely from one port before sending it on to the next would be unimportant.<br>  <br>  But if you have an incredibly fast internet connection (more than 100 megabits per second), that might be relevant.<br>  <br>  If you actually have a 10MHz HUB and a lot of computers sharing it, then they will be generating lots of noise on top of each other.<br>  <br>  Is the switch doing anything in addition to switching, like firewalling?<br>  <br>  If you have multiple PCs using the switch, have you assigned unique local IP addresses to all of them?|`|35a6354e8823ef05bf6dd42ddd7c238eaa	----------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Computer Slow<br>   <br>  Download and then run startup.exe at: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mlin.net/startupcpl.shtml......" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlin.net/startupcpl.shtml.......</a><br>  <br>  Can't live without it and windows...<br>  <br>  Then disable and/or uninstall whatever u don't need.<br>  <br>  Other things to try:<br>  <br>  1 - Disk Cleanup (removal of temp files, cookies, etc.)<br>  2 - Defrag<br>  3 - Registry Cleanup (CAN BE VERY RISKY!)<br>  <br>  Joe... <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Computer Virus/Spyware/Adware/Malware/etc<br>  <br>  All free...<br>  <br>  Download and then run Avira AntiVir Personal Edition Classic at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.free-av.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-av.com/</a><br>  <br>  Download and then run Spybot - Search & Destroy at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.safer-networking.org/en/downl...</a><br>  <br>  Download and then run Ad-Aware SE Personal at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaw...</a><br>  <br>  Joe... <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...

I don't play games on line, but sometimes it's just a matter of shared bandwidth...the more people playing, the better the chances of lag in general.  As far as videos, depends on the player, for one thing.  I might suggest emptying your Temporary Internet Files, for one thing, might clear some stuff.  Download CCleaner (i know it's at filehippo.com, among others), which is a great automatic...well, the first C stands for crap...should give you a hint...I've had hundreds of megs of temp files piling up, and that program gets rid of them quick.

c2632791ed9e10a3e9521323a075d757aa	The first thing you need to know is that an AMD Sempron 3200+ CPU is classified as a "socket AM2."  I gathered this info on a retail site, if you're curious:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buy.com/prod/AMD_Sempron_3200_1_8GHz_Processor_1_8GHz_1600MHz_HT_128KB_L1_128KB_L2/q/SearchEngine/Performics/Type/PI/Keyword/202601654/Category/Comp/loc/101/202601654.html?dcaid=17282)" rel="nofollow">http://www.buy.com/prod/AMD_Sempron_3200...</a><br>  <br>  The socket type is very important because that's what determines which chips will fit into your motherboard.  Now that we know the type that fit, I moved on to a good reference website for computer shopping.  Take a look at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sharkyextreme.com/</a><br>  <br>  Click on the tab "CPU Prices" at the top, then on the next page click on the latest posting for prices (they are updated weekly).  This week's page (week of Sept 11) looks like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/guides/WCPG/article.php/3631966" rel="nofollow">http://www.sharkyextreme.com/guides/WCPG...</a><br>  <br>  Don't get overwhelmed...there are quite a few AMD chips to choose from.  But, remember, you need one that has "AM2" in the description.  For instance, here's a couple of chips in the listing:<br>  <br>  CPU type:  Athlon 64 X2 4200+ (2.2GHz/S939 - Retail) <br>  Price:  $187 <br>  Change (since last week):  $0 <br>  Vendor selling at this price:  Mwave <br>  Phone #:  800-234-3358<br>   <br>  CPU type:  Athlon 64 X2 4200+ (2.2GHz/AM2 - Retail) <br>  Price:  $186 <br>  Change (since last week):  $0<br>  Vendor selling at this price:  ZipZoomFly <br>  Phone#:  877-228-6958<br>  <br>  You cannot buy the first one...it is meant for a different motherboard type (S939 socket type).  The second one should be compatible.  They are identical processors, except for the socket type, so it's very important to pay attention to that.<br>  <br>  Once you think you've found one that fits your budget, give the vendor a call and tell them what type of motherboard you have (Brand and model number).  Tell them the CPU you were considering and see if they think it is a good choice.  <br>  <br>  Knowledgeable sales staff can give you pointers on the advantages and disadvantages of different chips.  I usually go with something that gives you the most "bang for the buck."  The latest and greatest may make you the fastest on the block, but they aren't worth the money and drop the fastest in price, as well.  This is true for technology, in general, as you probably know.<br>  <br>  Last, but not least, ask them what their return policy is.  As soon as you receive the product, you'll want to replace your old chip right away to make sure the new one works.  Most places won't give you more than a month to return a defective (or otherwise incompatible) chip because of how quickly computer parts depreciate in value.  Some may also charge a restocking fee.  It's better to know all of this up front before you buy.  If it sounds like a bad deal, I'm sure you can find what you need elsewhere.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the upgrade.|`|04258d112f0b03d0db2fe5e4f0a95de0aa	search the usenet groups and you'll find a relevant group or two.|`|b1a0cb66c334a2432f083de01dee12f2aa	This is also a good site to check.<br>  <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomshardware.com</a>

The first three expansion packs, Notum Wars, Shadowlands and Alien Invasion, have received high praise and won 20 international awards. <br>  <br>  <br>  I dl'd it and played it for a week or so, it is pretty neat. I just didn't have the time to devote to it so quit playing. While it is not the best MMORPG (it is a shooter, but you have stats, etc to advance) it is very good for being free.<br>  <br>  Everyonce in awhile, some gaming sites (gamespy.com) will give away free games.<br>  Gamespy gave away Tribes (I can't recall which version it was) but you got the game for free, just had to register and request a "game key" and it was sent within a few minutes. Online play was free. Tribes is a very good shooter!<br>  Similar to Unreal Tournament, but your character can have more roles (medic, engineer, heavy infantry, scout, etc).<br>  <br>  Hope you find something that is fun to play!<br>  <br>  if you found this answer helpful please consider voting it the best answer.

'By pressing this you can convert the values.      You should have a function maybe to call when the certain units are selected from the ddl.

pogaNhAeaa	The most critical features of a CAD computer are speed and video capabilities. You need to look at 10,000 RPM hard disks, for example, and either a QX level CPU from Intel or an i7 core CPU. I rarely see anyone here who purchases the QX processors because they are very expensive, on the order of a couple of thousand dollars just for the processor alone - they are tailored more for business workstation applications and server apps and need higher end motherboards than your typical $300 gaming mobo's. The other thing is that video cards for CAD are really expensive - there is a whole other class of graphics cards which is outside the normal range of gaming cards - we are talking somewhere in the neighborhood of $1000 - $5000 just for a specialized CAD enhanced commercial grade video card. These are not advertised in gaming magazines because of their extreme cost. This is why a true commerical grade CAD workstation can easily cost $10,000 or more making it extremely difficult for the typical home buyer to afford. However, you asked the question and so I am giving you the straight answer - gaming rigs are not adequate to run true AUTOCAD operations because they simply are not good enough or fast enough. So expect to pay big money if you are going to do commercial grade graphics design.|`|5wAAnZPYaa	Key board, monitor,ucp, ups.mouse.

I don't know what the other programs are, if they're more power intensive than acad, but not a lot more, you can buy nearly any new computer, buy a decent graphics card and it'll be prefect.     Here's a great computer:  http://shop2.frys.com/product/5802043 - $499.99  for all brand-name computers, here's what you do: reformat it when you get it, that will get rid of all the useless crap that will slow it down that the manufacture likes to send people. HP loves to do that. So does the majority of all the brands.   If you can, try to get windows XP instead of vista. Vista reduces the performance of the computer and still has lots of unresolved problems. XP doesn't.    for auotcad and more design software, a good mouse and monitor is important. I image you already have a working monitor/mouse, so you may not need to buy a new one. for autocad its recommended to have a screen 19" or larger, and a resolution of 1280x1024 or larger. For mouse, the regular 2 button and scroll wheel of your choice will do. You probably already have one of those.|`|QYPrM3GPaa	The most critical features of a CAD computer are speed and video capabilities.

Be mindful of what you are doing to receive the warnings in the first place - are you sending too many messages per day?  Try to cut back - especially if you are sending to all your friends.  If you have a lot of friends and are sending out numerous messages per day, Facebook may consider you to be a spammer and hence will close down your account.

XYZ + ( X' Y' Z' )    So you have three inputs that means you will have 2^3 rows of possible input combinations. Your table will have four columns as well, because you have three inputs and one result. Fill in the inputs with every possible input combination:    (Note: the question marks are not "don't cares")  X | Y | Z | Output  0 | 0 | 0 | ?  0 | 0 | 1 | ?  0 | 1 | 0 | ?  0 | 1 | 1 | ?  1 | 0 | 0 | ?  1 | 0 | 1 | ?  1 | 1 | 0 | ?  1 | 1 | 1 | ?    Then plug each input combination to the expression and evaluate it to complete the output column:  X | Y | Z | Output  0 | 0 | 0 | 1  0 | 0 | 1 | 0  0 | 1 | 0 | 0  0 | 1 | 1 | 0  1 | 0 | 0 | 0  1 | 0 | 1 | 0  1 | 1 | 0 | 0  1 | 1 | 1 | 1

BLx5fknPaa	There is no easy way.    Your "saved files and pictuers and video" are hopefully in your personal folder, which can include the Desktop, Documents, Picture, Videos etc. In Windows XP, you can find them in C:\Documents and Settings\ and in Windows Vista, you can find them in C:\Users\ usually.    As for "a lot of progress saved on video games", that depends on what video games you play. Usually, it might be in Documents, Saved Games or Application Data. You can try searching for them though.    Anyway, it would be advisable to store your "saved files and pictuers and video" in one location, or at least somewhere where you can find them. It would be a good idea to clean your hard drive regularly too. I do that every month.|`|wnwCrUlLaa	lol.. how come you dont know ur own files. actually, if video games progres, you can find it in my document. or in installation files. but if you remember the name of the file or folder, try using search tools.|`|jh4gw3O8aa	No easy way. You just have to find the files you want to keep, and transfer them over to your new harddisk (assuming your going to buy a new one, if not then back them up on dvd or something).  You'll also have to reinstall any games or programs, cause usually they need registry entries as well.  I usually do a fresh OS install every 2 years.  Keeps the junk from piling up.
dfjIBHe3aa	There are really so many programs it is more worthwhile to speak in generalities than specifics.  Excuse the lecture, but anything written for Linux or Unix is readily available in Linux and that means literally thousands of off-beat programs.    Linux is the kernel of the operating system.  Period.  Originally, back in 1983 some people around MIT (but not faculty) got sick of the proprietization of operating systems and began the GNU project (short for GNU is Not Unix) to provide a free alternative to UNIX.  Their tools were so excellent they spread to many implementations of Unix, but they got bogged down on the kernel.  At about the same time, or a year or two later, MIT (including Faculty), IBM and some firms with names like Digital Equipment (Now I believe part of HP) began work on a cross-platfform graphics user interface called X-Windows.  You can actually see it on, mainly University computers on old movies and tv documentary footage from the eighties and nineties.    Intel computers were not sophisticated enough to run the GNU tools or X-windows, until a guy named D. J. Delorie ported the GNU tools over to it in a package called DJGPP because he heard the big Kahuna say GNU tools would never run on MS-DOS.  As Intel chips became able to run UNIX Microsoft began reinventing the wheel with Windows, and in 1991 a Finnish Grad Student created the Linux kernel to run GNU Tools and X-Windows, and together the three became the Linux Operating System.    That's what makes your question so complicated.  Netscape, whose modern-day descendents are Firefox and Seamonkey, was written on Unix and was literally available for Linux within HOURS of its release, while Windows versions waited for six months.  Blender is also software which began yea so many years ago as a UNIX project, while the GIMP was first released for both Linux and Unix.  For licensing reasons, most (but not all) Adobe software is not available for Linux but for the most part if something is available for Unix it is available for Linux and there is even something called REALBasic which is compatible with Visual Basic code (reasonably compatible).    Distributions such as Ubuntu, Gentoo, Debian, Fedora and Mandriva will generally select packages and make them available.  Most Distributions come in 3 flavors (make it nine for Ubuntu as the three should be multiplied by the three desktops -- this Debian system has KDE AND XFCE4 installed so I can run either as I choose, and that option is open to all of them, so most don't differentiate between desktops as Ubuntu does but offer Gnome, KDE and XFCE4 desktops as options).  The three flavors are stable -- which is.  Moreso, usually than Windows, Testing, which has newer packages, and is usually about as stable as windows, and Unstable, which has the newest untested packages.  Unless you are using Unstable and have good reason to go out for this, you are well-advised to use your distribution's version of a given package.  It usually installs to the menu and crashes less often.    It's interesting to note that CDRtools, which probably came with your distribution or can usually be installed (except Debian has a forked version called wodim) has been subject to controversy among linux users because the developer works on the Sun Solaris OS and before Solaris was officially Open Sourced switched to the Sun licensing arrangements.     Finally, rather than the executable binary system Windows have where programs with specific filenames (exe com bat ini) are executed, Linux uses the ELF system -- stands for Executable and Linking Format -- which decides what programs to run based on whether they have permission to run.  If you have a file named document.txt and run chmod +x document.txt you have just told the operating system to run it if possible.  If the document is a text file it will probably try to run it as a batch file.    From X-Windows you just click on icons or open a terminal or the run box (alt-f2) and type the name of the program you want to run.  By default and for security reasons X-Windows does not include the current directory on your executable path though (which of course means that malware has to hunt for a directory to install themselves in to execute).  To execute a program in the current directory, you type  a period then a slash (dot-slash or ./) before the executable program --in either the terminal or the run box.  By default Linux stores most executables in either the /bin or /sbin  directories, or in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin, or in the /opt, /usr/share /usr/local/ or even /usr/lib directories.  This depends on the distribution and on the program.  (realplayer is usually in /opt.)      I hope the above his helpful.|`|5zSSGKBpaa	There are 2 parts to your question; the default software in any version of linux that you install, and the software that is available in general for that version.  Just like windows doesn't install all the available software during the install linux only installs a basic set of programs (what can fit on a cd) and the user then installs whatever they want. Since all the programs are free the only limit to what a user can install is size of the hard drives.  If you tell us what version of linux you are looking at we could give some idea of what is on the cd.  As far as the total repository for a particular version, which is many GBs, each piece of  software there (they are called packages) are tuned for that particular version of linux.  See the link below for a more complete description.  The next 2 links are a listing of linux apps and the linux software equivalent to Windows software.

oEYrC1Wsaa	Can you open it @ all?  If so scan it for the "conficker virus", it's a new virus that can be put on USB's by inserting it into an infected PC then when you insert it in a new PC it passes the virus on.  Google the virus & check the info,  it's listed @ microsoft & gives a full description.  (Better safe than sorry).     If it's not a virus, & you haven't had the USB long, take it back to the shop, it should have some sort of warranty or they might know what or where else to check.   Hope it works out.

Have a look at the DVD player's specifications.|`|e10jkZy4aa	Here is a step by step guide to burn DVD from any video formats. It works well for me.  http://www.freedvdripper.org/dvdvideogui...  Also, you can search some other ones:  http://www.google.com|`|mOAY4FbJaa	It depends on the capabilities of the DVD player itself.  Many DVD players are able to play video formats such as AVI, MPEG, AND WMV without having to be converted to DVD format (VOB).  Some are even capable of playing DivX-encoded (and, by extension in my own personal experience, XVid-encoded) videos, but make sure you can see the DivX logo on either the player, the box, or the instruction manual before trying them.  Be sure to read the specifications of your particular player and instructions on how to play computer video files before trying this, and if possible, burn the videos in question to a DVD-RW disk and try it out before wasting a DVD-R; most players that can read DVD-R should be able to read DVD-RW disks.  Again, the manual should be able to tell you which disk formats are supported.    I hope this helps.

As a result, you may need to get a little more creative with your user name selection. Try adding other characters before or after the user name you wish to usemany people add their birth year or other identifying information, like this: Maria1972, MariaNY. You can also bracket the name with other characters like this: xxUSERxx.    You can only use letters and numbers for your user name; no spaces or special characters like dashes or underscores are allowed.  User names are not case-sensitive, so 123ABC will be recognized as the same as 123abc. Therefore, if someone else has the user name you want but capitalizes different letters than you, you still can't create that user name.     Hopefully it will help you.

AA11322322	Make sure you understand the concept of Open and Closed systems!    Essentially, a closed loop system has at least one form of feedback....  Thus something measured at the output is fed back to control the input!    For example, imagine a steel mill rolling sheet steel to a given thickness, if the output steel is to too thick, then information is fed back which causes the rollers to tighten and hence thinning the steel... when the steel becomes too thin, the feedback has the opposite affect!    Look around you... In your kitchen, at the supermarket, everywhere.... You find examples of both types of system!    Hope this Helps!....            `

Put a clear photo to your home page it will help.|`|g8mAKg8Saa	it could do with a bit more of a professional look (please dont take any offence to that because it wasnt intended)  instead of using a list for the pages you can get some cool font and use that as a link to your next pages.   if you are to put photographs on make sure they are high quality and try and put a border around them so they dont look so out of place.  i think you should change the colour of your font at the top because it kinda gets lost in the busy background.  over all it is a good effort but with a bit of work it could look so much better.  try using this website for colour codes and fonts = http://pic2.piczo.com/sophi1985/?g=17920...  and you will get an example of how you can change the links instead of just using a list.  also if you search in google piczo help ect lots of piczo sites will come up which were made to help people like you :) hope i helped xx|`|bMIDDAKmaa	its really pretty but the title is a little hard on the eyes  maybe u can change the color ... or back ground  the brides maid page is perfect  the pictures look a little close together on some pages, makes them look cluttered   maybe u shouldnt pile the pictures or use borders to separate sections.
C2aWncmkaa	You need to get that computer off the Internet, a hacker has installed a program that allows remote control of your computer.    Once you have disconnected from the Internet (unplug Ethernet or turn off the wireless) do this:    Reboot the computer, and press and hold F8 before Windows starts up.  Select Safe Mode.  After Windows finishes starting, go to     /WINDOWS/System32 and find MRT.EXE    It is an anti-malware program designed to remove rootkits.    Then run Windows Defender and scan the whole drive.    After that:    You need to get a anti-malware program, someone can download one for you from the Internet, or you can buy one at Target, Wal-Mart, Office Max, Office Depot, Best Buy, etc.    Norton, McAfee, BitDefender, AVG, ZoneAlarm, Kapersky are available depending on what is in stock at a store.  They can also be downloaded from the Internet, just put the name in the Search box.    You can download Spybot Search and Destroy (using someone else's computer) and burn it to a CD and then put it on your computer.  It's completely free.    http://www.safer-networking.org/  .|`|8sWdrYvVaa	Sounds like you have spyware/adware/viruses on your computer.

x35co5F8aa	I am rather confused - you want to install Linux to a HARD DISK, not a computer? This is not possible.    You can burn a bootable CD - I assume that your old PC has a CD drive? You must put a liveCD in there and boot the computer - then install from CD.    Your computer needs to have an internal Hard Drive, I believe, for this to work.|`|5zSSGKBpaa	If you install linux on a hard drive while attached to a laptop and then install the hard drive into another pc you could have serious problems trying to get it to run. When you install it on the laptop the installation will be setup up for that monitor, cpu, motherboard, type of memory, etc and then when yo try to boot it in the pc most if not all of those items will be different and will produce multiple errors.  I presume you don't have a cdrom in the old pc.  I am sure the old pc cannot boot from the usb either. I think your only option would be to beg or borrow a cdrom for the installation process. You could probably buy a cdrom for $20.  Good luck|`|Og3vKQeWaa	Boot off a live linux cd and go from there. And no, you sure don`t want to end up with linux on laptop!

2SSA9e9Naa	Ok, too much code to read so I'll explain how I do this myself.    This is done through attribute access methods in the sub forms. In OO design you have the parent object pulling information out of contained objects (sub forms) when the subforms are done.    In C  the prescribed method is use of the get and set methods.    Let's take a subform that has a username text box on it as an example. In the subform's class you would have a method such as    public string UserName() {get {return txtUserName.text;}}    The main form would do the following:    Form subform = new Form(); // sub your form class here  subForm.ShowDialog(); // going from memory for this call  string userName = subForm.UserName;    Does that make sense? Email me if you have more questions.    I would highly recommend the O'Reilly book on C  3.0 as a great resource http://www.amazon.com/Programming-C-3-0-... Even for me who has been in the field for 30 years it has been a great tool.

YF4JDSUqaa	With utorrent connection speed and file popularity is the most important factor when downloading with utorrent.    My computer downloads at a 1.2MB per second only because of my internet connection speed and popularity of the file.    Ex: Everyone Knows Elvis Presley so anything you download from him will take no time because of his popularity.    Ex: But if I were downloading the Jungle Book, who would get more attention: Elvis or the Jungle Book.    File Popularity is HUGE!    And downloading multiple files could be the main reason why your downloads are playing file tag.  With a fast connection Movies can take only two to three hours but If your downloading multiple movies and a time it could take well over eight to nine hours to a week to finish them all.    If you have a 300kbps speed I would only download 3 files simultaneously   If you have a 100kbps speed I would only download 1 file at a time  But if you have a 500kbps or higher download speed, then I would download up to five to ten files simultaneously.    Note. Movies are approx. 1.4-2gigs per movie.  That's Alot, and probably going to be the largest file your computer has.    I Hope this help you!|`|ZPBPwEQBaa	it depends on your internet speed a slow cennection will take longer then a fast one and all together.|`|VAZaZ9s9aa	Downloading so many movies uses up more ports on your computer, so it's downloading bits from each movie at a time and they're all slowing each other down. Do one thing at a time.    Get one, maybe two movies downloading at a time if you have an ordinary cable/DSL connection, and pause the others. Normally, on a good download with enough seeders, it will take a couple of hours for a ~700 MB file to finish. Sometimes it might take a few days. In that case, find a better torrent with more seeders.    Set the download you want to be finished first to High Priority mode. Also, it depends on the tracker, the size of the movie, etc.|`|J4dMBVSJaa	Actually Torrent is dependable on the user hashing the files, the more user online the better. Speed wise depends on ISP network provider (in some countries are still sluggish). And to your question, there is none. Also set your priority on your file, the higher isn't better but at least UTorrent or any  torrent P2P client will prioritized the files.    It's basically about luck and the users having the same file and unless you are using a 1GB connection.  A week is better than a month. Cheers.    HT20

Today, Macs use a subset of PC hardware .      Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...    Mac OS X has viruses (which is significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it.

WINDOWS LICENSE is discounted with PCs  http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/200...    Repairs are more expensive than PCs since the IMac, Mac Mini are compact units, and Apple charges a premium for their services. Some repairs can be done by another repair service but the compact design of the computer causes problems.  With an IMac, if the problem is with the monitor, the whole computer would have to be brought in.  IMac and Mac mini lack expansion.    Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.  All macs are standardized with Cameras, if your system gets hacked, the hacker would more likely be able to turn on your camera.

Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.

Plus, none of your Windows software will work on OS X without some huge workaround (like installing Windows on your Mac).  This is especially true for video games.  Another thing I dislike about Macs is their one mouse button.  That gets annoying fast.|`|ZThrhNDpaa	Things are a bit simpler on macs which can be really annoying when you're used to the billions of options for everything on pcs. OSX can be a bit frustrating when your used to windows.  It can sometimes be difficult to find free apps for macs but you don't need all the hundreds of plugins, antivirus, spyware/ malware scanners that are necessary with windows. So it's not such an issue.    I think my mac has had programs freeze up on it about three times in the last year. The system has never totally crashed. That compared to my PC crashing probably every other day at least. It takes about a quarter of the time to start up compared to windows as well.    Basically i find the difference to be that macs feel like you're driving a well engineered luxury car compared to a daewoo. It feels well put togethr, smooth and reliable. Pc's always feel cheap and nasty to me now and like they're always just about to break down.

mOAY4FbJaa	If you have TweakUI on your system, you might want to check it for the X-Mouse feature.  X-Mouse is a feature that allows you to do just what you are experiencing--hover your mouse pointer over a window and bring it to the forefront--only it works with ALL programs.  Simply open TweakUI, go to Mouse-->X-Mouse, and see if the options "Activation follows mouse" and "Autoraise when activating" are checked.  If they are and you don't like this feature, simply uncheck the boxes and click OK to save the changes.  The problem should go away immediately.    I couldn't find a definitive source on which settings in the Registry control this behavior for a manual edit, so downloading and installing TweakUI is the easiest way to control this behavior.

AA11284831	In an Ethernet network it's limited to 100 meters.  This is due to the signaling and timing of the Ethernet spec, not because of signal degradation due to length as many inexperienced net workers think.  If you have a run that exceeds 100 meters, even by a few inches, you can experience late collisions.  This is particularly problematic in switched networks because collision detection is turned off on full-duplex segments and switched Ethernet is full-duplex by default.  For this reason it's also important to consider the length of any patch cables that will be used, in addition to the embedded horizontal and vertical cable runs.|`|JikpvGcXaa	100 meters = 328 ft|`|bkkO2uw0aa	anything less then 100 m cat6 is more expensive and will serve you better long term with growing network capacities. but cat5e is pretty much the standard today|`|bbf8f564d5e1675db8cb7cbcc84b0bebaa	Depends on what for.

I've been running high end (for my comp) games for a while now, no problems at all seen. the only issue is that the fans runs faster to keep the parts cool, which increases dust build up, which you need to clean it out more often.

Just running a well written contained program like a game has virtually no effect on your system.    The only caveat is that a game may produce slightly more heat as processing occurs more frequently.    However, manufacturers use numerous techniques to minimize that.  If you notice your system getting unusually hot - then you may be reaching a critical temperature where damage is possible. But if it seems the system is normal temperature then you are all good.|`|pogaNhAeaa	yes it will as u don't have a graphic card|`|7u8ZOWnqaa	everything wears it down, make sure u keep ur laptop propped up with good ventilation and dont play those games for 8hr+ straight everyday for 2yrs and u should be ok|`|9o8lEBSnaa	It won't    Enjoy your games =)|`|noR7qnFPaa	No playing games will not damage it at all.

PCs are very vulnerable; any activity on your computer will damage your laptop. Laptops are meant to be temporary solutions that are replaced every 2 years; they are not meant to be lifelong companions. It is just a matter of how quickly and how badly your laptop is worn out. Just ensure that your laptop enjoys sufficient ventilation and it is not used for 16 hours continuously; that should allow it to last for 2 years.

This card therefor is completely incompatible with your PC.    You can upgrade to an 8400GS mind you, there are a couple of companies that produce them for PCI slots.

AA11256390	If you're going to choose something with Vista then you'll need at least 2GB memory, so as far as I can tell it counts out the 1525 as it's only 1GB. Vista on it's own takes up 1GB of memory to run which means your system will run a lot slower. Those who have Vista may not even notice it if they've never had memory big enough to run it properly as to them it will seem normal but it does make a big difference.

2LHgmq97aa	Microsoft Office does not have the exact same functionality as windows version.... but continue reading before you switch    With the Mac you are paying significantly more for lower spec hardware.  Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is OS X worth buying a Mac?    I would say no... for the following reasons...    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION. It can do just about any cool effect a Mac can do and more...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...  (there is no flickering when you use it like on the video, not sure why the person has the flicker)  3) Like the Mac OS X Doc? google/yahoo Cairo Dock, avant window navigator.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3rf5q_...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hzi22g2...  4) It is faster/MORE SECURE.

For easy instructions on setting up Dual Boot http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windo...    VIRUSES  Mac OS X has viruses (which is significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".  http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005  http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...  http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...    SECURITY  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.  All macs are standardized with Cameras, if your system gets hacked, the hacker would more likely be able to turn on your camera.  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.  http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/so...  http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/2...  http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft...    QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...  http://www.appledefects.com/  |`|hXHBm1BSaa	It will probably only come with a trial version of Microsoft Office unless you pay extra.

You still get Word, Excel, and PowerPoint; Outlook is called Entourage in this package. You miss out on FrontPage, Publisher, Visio, OneNote, Access, Groove, and all of the other apps that are in the advanced versions of Office; there are apps on Mac OS X that function the same as these apps.    I would be honest in telling you, however, that while the Mac hardware is truly awesome, engineering is still a Windows world. If you make the switch, you'll need a copy of Windows XP or Vista and either the patience to install Windows in BootCamp or a Virtualization program such as Parallel's Desktop, VMWare Fusion, or Sun VirtualBox.|`|oOPLEUyNaa	Microsoft office suite has always been available for the MAC, it is not something new.  It is not as complete as the version that runs on the windows operating system.  Maybe it is the Malaysia language release but the english version has been available for a while, not quite as complete as the PC version.     I find that the MAC is stable operating system and less prone to attacks, but it is worse than Microsoft about expense for everthing.  In Malaysia every PC part and software is cheaper than here in the US, but I would think every thing Apple is very expensive.    I use Mepis a debian based Linux and Microsoft office suite runs in wine, but I never need to use it as Open Office opens everything I receive from work and friends.    I do not use Inkscape, Xara Xtreme, Scribus, nor am I creating any web design, but Adobe Photoshop cs will also run in wine on most any Linux Distribution.  Have you tried Maya, and Gimp?    JR

K3ROwdFwaa	You can easily and effectivily block access to a website by adding it to your Windows HOSTS file. (Yes, Hosts is capitalised for some strange reason).    1.Go to your HOSTS file which is located at:  C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC (for windows Vista and XP)  C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC (for Windows 2k)  C:\WINDOWS (for Windows 98 and ME)    2. Open HOSTS with Notepad. Right click and make sure that its not read only. If it is read only uncheck that block and make it read only again after you are done with following instructions.    The default Windows HOSTS looks like this:  ______________________      Copyright ? 1993-1999 Microsoft Corp.        This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.        This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each    entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should    be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.    The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one    space.        Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual    lines or following the machine name denoted by a " " symbol.        For example:        102.54.94.97 rhino.acme.com   source server    38.25.63.10 x.acme.com   x client host      127.0.0.1 localhost  _____________________________    3. Directly under the line that says 127.0.0.1 Localhost, you will want to type:    127.0.0.1 name of the URL you want to block    For example to block the MySpace.com homepage (highly recommended!), simply type:    127.0.0.1 myspace.com  127.0.0.1 www.myspace.com    Other parts of MySpace could be blocked in a similar way:    127.0.0.1 search.myspace.com  127.0.0.1 profile.myspace.com  etc etc etc...    You may need to add sites with both with and without the "www.". Test after blocking to make sure you got it right.    You can add as many sites as you wish to block in this fashion.    4. Close Notepad and answer "Yes" when prompted.    5. Reboot your computer and attempt to access your now blocked website. You should see a Cannot find server or DNS Error saying: "The page cannot be displayed".    -----------------------------    Some people suggest that you add a website that you wish to block by adding it to Internet Explorer's Restricted Zone. This does NOT totally block a site. It will only RESTRICT a site from certain actions such as using javascript, Active-X and Java etc.     Some people suggest that your add a website to the Internet Explorer 'Privacy' settings. This does not block a site. It only stops that site from using cookies.    Enjoy,  Goldest|`|AygEpMMaaa	pgsurfer,its free    We cannot watch our children every minute of the day.

In fact, there is actually a utility you can download to implement those tweaks: http://www.speedguide.net/downloads.php .  I realize that you probably have Vista since this is a new computer, but it looks like this particular utility is compatible with Vista (more on that here: http://www.speedguide.net/faq_in_q.php?q... ).  It is certainly true that your ISP determines the MAXIMUM amount of bandwidth your computer can use based on your plan.  However, you may be able to optimize your system to be able to take maximum advantage of that bandwidth.  All I can say is to try it and see what happens, and you can always research for yourself to see if other methods might work.  By the way, this utility also saves your previous configuration by default, so you can easily reverse the changes it makes.    I hope this helps.

7KkRkseUaa	water cooling would be best, but highend air cooling is known to handle these chips at 4ghz + the temps will be a bit high so i wouldn't keep it on 24/7.  its not just the cooling tho, you'll need a board that can handle a fsb of 500mhz + the extra voltages. plenty of case cooling as the northbridge will get very hot too.  alot of highend boards can do this tho, just look for some reviews.  go for it though!! i've been trying for ages to break the 4ghz barrier on my Q9550 with no joy.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	if in doubt, water cool it. its better than air and many serious OC people use water over a bunch of fans and huge heatsink.     otherwise, buy a heatsink/fan combo with a larger watts ratting than the total watts output of your CPU overclocked.   Watts is power/heat dissipated, if the heatsink/fan combo has a lower watts rating than the CPU can output, then you have a serious problem- the CPU will overheat or melt.     alternatively, if you nuts about OC, phase change is the ultimate way to go. its like having a refrigerator's freezer cooling your CPU. Phase change is often expensive, bulky, and noisy. Phase change systems can handle up to 600 watts cooling power (its like a fridge).|`|yTD84yFlaa	There are so many factors it's impossible to give you a straight answer.

cec85c13c2fe3c1a2e88f3cd36bfa9c9aa	Unfortunately, there's no way to prevent users from saving data to their computers if they can get it through a web browser or other open interface.  The only way to ensure they won't be able to save your data would be for you to create a clientside app that would connect with your server, then send the file as encrypted, and the clientside app would authenticate the session and display the file.  Even this is vulnerable, as the client could see the file in memory or just copy the screen.

t7O3Erpvaa	Ok here's something I wish someone had told me before i made my latest gaming PC: DON'T go with the i7 processor. Get one of the quad cores from the last generation, intel, at a decent price point, and a corresponding motherboard. Also on the motherboard, pick Gigabyte over ASUS for the stability afforded. You will save yourself a bucket of money, and actually end up with a HIGHER performance, MORE stable PC.    Also, the videocard, ditch ATI and get the equivalent nVidea, the 280 - ATI's drivers are a pile of crap at the moment, and have been giving me the shits with COD5, FC2, CSS:S, CoH, TF2 and more.    Hope you heed my warnings. Wish I had had the same. Everything else is fine - of course you'll need different RAM, etc, but 4GB will be plenty.|`|rptlxw2Paa	It will be a awesome gaming system dude.

My budget is 900 bucks. so I have the processor and the memory (regular kind 6 GB for $135) and then nothing else matches your wish list. And I really shopped around for best price. My i7 CPU is $200; local store, doubt they ship to Australia.     for the DVD burner, you can go better - if you buy a OEM DVD-ram drive it may be slower but it will burn/read every DVD and CD format there is. Two of them will allow DVD/CD copies much faster.     for hard drives, you can buy a 1TB drive for like 100$. cheaper than spending $150 for 500 GB.     and graphics, I've seen the newest graphics card from nvidia. GTX 295, way better than the PALIT HD4870 on your list. it costs more though. $500.     and with that rig, its not a basic PC, its probably the best PC.|`|1cSaoJAtaa	Well at least your getting quality parts..

a684462f8e6ac3562a8758d2cf429131aa	Kinda good, is overkill in a few places. I have never filled a 20g HD up with my work. I have downloaded enough songs and media to fill a 20g, but 1terabyte is ginormous.  If that is all the RAM slots available, or if that is the limit of the motherboard, run away.  Mind you, 4g is great, after a year of filling that drive, it will seem weak.  One quick search and I found an HP with 8g RAM and nice other stuffs for $400 less.  *see link*  There is also a gateway with a 1tb HDD for less also.  Look at newegg, then cnet,zdnet, then back to newegg, you can have a better one home built for around $350-$450  Even certified factory built ones are less than that.  You did not say if you what OS you want to use, that matters alot in hardware specs.  I run Ubuntu Linux/windows of my choice CPU is 4 years old but it can keep up with most any others.

HDD is how much information it can hold, and that is ALOT! Actually, I have never seen a computer with so much storage! My PC has only 70GB and my laptop has 250GB.  The RAM (Random Accessing Memory), 4GB is ALOT aswell! My PC has 2GB but you will have a quad processor. That means that you have 4 cores so that you can have alot of programs running at the same time. It will be VERY fast. So you have 4GB of RAM spread out between 4 cores, so that is 1 GB of RAM for each core. DDR2 is quite a rare RAM but it is good, better than my SDRAM. The 2.5 is how fast the processor is. So it will be 2.5 GHz which extrodanary fast! Most of the new high tech computers these days have around 3 - 3.5GHz. At $1650, it sounds a very fair price! I'd go for it!|`|fUDlbOP0aa	nvidia cash?

Remember that reinstallation erases all the data on the selected hard-disk partition. :)|`|mOAY4FbJaa	I'm not sure I'm understanding you, but it sounds like F8 is not even giving you the startup menu.  If that is the case, you unfortunately have few options.  I also don't know what Windows version you have, so I am assuming XP.  First, make absolutely sure you're not even getting the menu; if you ARE getting the menu and Safe Mode is simply not listed, you can try the following options in this order: Last Known Good Configuration Safe Mode with Command Prompt, or Enable VGA Mode.    Before going any further, though: If you have physically installed any new hardware just prior to this problem beginning, shut down your computer and remove it; then try to boot normally and see what happens.  It's always possible you have a hardware conflict, especially if you recently installed a new video card.  If you were upgrading from a different video card, for example, you may need to remove the drivers for the old card before putting the new one in and attempting to install drivers for it.  In any event, removing the new hardware should at least get you to Safe Mode, and you can uninstall drivers for the old AND new hardware (if applicable) before powering down and reinstalling the new hardware.    Now let's take those other boot options in order.  Last Known Good Configuration literally loads the last configuration that worked for your system.  If that works, you should undo any changes you have made to your system, such as driver updates or new hardware/software installations.    Safe Mode with Command Prompt loads Safe Mode with a black box and access to a command line for entering text-based commands.  If this works, you can attempt to run System Restore from the command line (Yahoo! tends to chop off some of these commands, so view the original source below as necessary).  Type the following:    %systemroot%\system32\restore\rstrui.e...    Press Enter after typing in the command, then follow the wizard as if you were restoring from normal Windows.    Enable VGA Mode disables the video driver installed on your system and attempts to boot normally.  If you have updated your video driver recently, this is a good option to try but may not be effective for other hardware or software issues.    Now, assuming that you are not even getting the F8 menu, you are probably going to need to run a repair installation of Windows.  To do this, you have to reconfigure your computer to boot from the CD-ROM drive by going into the BIOS.  The steps vary from system to system, but in general, you want to look either for a menu labeled "Boot Sequence" or something to that effect or go into your Advanced options.  Insert the XP disk into your drive BEFORE saving the changes, and then press Enter when asked to press a key to boot from the CD.  Once the Windows Setup program loads, accept the license agreement.  You'll soon be prompted that Windows is already installed and asked to repair the installation.  Choose the repair option, and Windows will go through the motions of reinstalling Windows WITHOUT erasing your hard drive.  When you come back into Windows, you will likely need to install drivers and all Windows security patches.  Use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer tool to help you: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/secur... .  Once your system is back up, make sure you scan for viruses and spyware.  If you need real-time protection, download AVG 8 Free Edition from http://www.download.com .  Also download Spyware Terminator, Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, and Ad-Aware Anniversary Edition (do not enable real-time protection for these services; stick with AVG or your current anti-virus for that).  Update the definitions for all security software and scan your system with each program to make sure it's clean and that any malware on your system is removed.  Do this BEFORE attempting to install any additional updates.    If the repair installation fails, check to make sure you are not getting any error messages, especially blue screens, that can be researched on-line for additional troubleshooting steps.  Barring this, however, you will either need to erase your hard drive and totally reinstall Windows--which will destroy everything on the drive--or perform what's known as a "parallel installation," which installs Windows to a different folder on your drive and deactivates all programs from the previous installation but allows you to preserve your data.  In either case, you will need to completely reinstall all drivers and software on your computer and reinstall all Windows patches.  Use these options as a last resort, however.    I hope this helps.

ossCVxPqaa	This is easy to do, but let us make it a useful spreadsheet so that you can use any start number and any add on value.  Set up your spreadsheet in the following way. You can use any cells you wish, but I will use my choice - change cell numbers as necessary. I do not like being cramped up in the corner of the spreadsheet, so I will start in cell E3 . In this cell enter Start Number as text and  highlight and outline cell F3   In cell E4 enter Add on Number as text, and outline cellF4    Now you want your list of numbers to be in column B, starting with cell B3 (as I said I do not like to start in A1) So in Cell B3 enter =F3 and then in cell B4 enter exactly: =B3+$F$4   Press enter (note the $signs)   Now highlight cell B4, and using the small marker in the bottom right hand corner, drag down a far as you wish to go with your additive list. You can make this list as long as you wish.  It is now a good idea to insert a line box around all these cells.    Now to use, if you want to start with 655 and add 15 on each time, you enter 655 into cell F3 and enter in cell F4, 15. The list in column B will be complete as required.    Edit later: I forgot to mention that this spreadsheet can also do continuous subtraction without any modification. If you start with, say 180, and you want to subtract 25 continuously, enter 180 in F3 and -25 in F4 and column B will show the reducing value, even down to negative numbers.|`|SrfLbfwMaa	Quick way, do this in cell B1  =A1  And this in B2  =B1+50    copy B2 down to get the values in column A as you requested    VBAXLMan

AA11976863	It simply means the computer cannot find the pre-chosen operating system. Several possible causes:    * NVRAM is corrupt (solution: reset it)  * Hard drive has data corruption (always repairable, but could involve data loss).  * Basic system files / folders are renamed, moved, corrupted, or missing (solution: name them back, move them back, reinstall OS X).  * Hard drive not properly installed (missing or disconnected or bad cable).  * Hard drive has mechanical or electrical problems (usually not repairable; must replace the drive)    Since it is hard to know which of these is the cause of your flashing "?", start with the easiest solution and work up to the drastic ones.    Reset NVRAM by holding four keys during startup: command - option - P - R. Hold these keys until the screen goes off and on twice, or you hear the startup chime music tone twice. Don't over do it. In this case, more is not better -- two flashes or chines is the perfect number, five is too many.    No OS X install disc? Skip to the last paragraph. If you have an OS X disc, put it in the DVD drive, restart and hold option key until you see the Startup Manager screen. Click on the DVD icon, press return. At the installer screen, open Disk Utility from one of the menus. Click on the First Aid tab. Is the hard drive icon shown at the left? Good. Choose to repair the hard drive. If problems show up, hope they can be repaired. If the problems can't be repaired, you will need to buy another Mac drive utility disc and hope it can repair the drive or...    Quit Disk Utility, go through the license agreement screens, select the hard drive, click "Options". Choose "Erase and install" (all your data will be lost). If Disk Utility found no problems or repaired all problems successfully, reinstall OS X (only possible if it has never been updated) or do "Archive install preserving Users and network".    If no hard drive icon shows in Disk Utility, quit, shutdown. Open the case and reseat (unplug -- plug back in) the connections to the hard drive. Reset NVRAM again. If you still have the flashing "?", boot to the install disc again, open Disk Utility again. If you have a hard drive icon, try to repair the hard drive or reinstall. If no hard drive icon, buy a new hard drive.    Without an OS X install disc, you have few options, but try this. Restart and hold command -S. After the Apple logo (and if the hard drive can mount), it will have a black screen with white text. When it finally stops loading, type these commands (without the " but with appropriate spaces):        "/sbin/fsck -fy"      Press Return.      Wait.    fsck will go through five "phases" and then return information about your disk's use and fragmentation. Once it finishes, it'll display this message if no issue is found:        ** The volume (name_of_volume) appears to be OK     If fsck found issues and has altered, repaired, or fixed anything, it will display this message:        ***** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED *****     Important: If this message appears, repeat the fsck command until fsck tells you that your volume appears to be OK (first-pass repairs may uncover additional issues, so this is a normal thing to do).  When fsck reports that your volume is OK, type reboot at the prompt and then press Return.

I creates a virtual drive on your computer that you can mount disc images onto. So, say you have an image file of a DVD. A common format is ISO.

So with daemon tools, you can create a "virtual" DVD drive on your computer that you can "mount" or load the image file and media onto.

It is warning you that if you alter this part of the document, you may not be able to open it with a default or installed program, so keep it as .doc for a word, .txt for notepad, and .html for a web page etc.     I hope this helped. you could also try changing the last part after the "." in order to get a program you know you have to open it.|`|ifO5Et8Faa	coz its shortcut would be unusable coz the target file wouldn't exist!!!  before changing the name,ensure that you don't hve ne shortcuts before renaming it...then it's safe.....  or maybe if it's a program,don't even think about changing it...  the program may nt work|`|b4xpwfCdaa	Keep the letters (file extension) after the full stop (.) the same.

s92HDgwkaa	The way microchips are encoded means that everything is a multiple of 2. You might notice every numeric value in the coding and hardware of a computer divides nicely into each other.    For example, a kilobyte is 1024 bytes, internet download speeds are often measured in 256 (divides into 1024) and 128 (divides into 1024).    Back in the old days, data was encrypted in measurements of 4, 8 and 16.    PCI, PCI-e and AGP cards (graphics cards, network cards, sound cards etc.) all have either 16 or 32 pins in them.    Anyway, to answer your question, they rounded off their values to the nearest measurement. 1024 turned into 1000 (kilo), 1240000 turned into 1000000 (million or mega), and I can't be bothered going into gigabytes and terabytes (too many zeros).    But you get the idea ;)|`|07b8313b7096ade2a84057ef85256e06aa	I've wondered the same thing.|`|azaMkJijaa	It's like asking 'What did they call a centipede and a millipede before the metric system?'|`|ZAfrqSn1aa	Its as Nic said to some degree. Basically its all about the binary encoding system. In binary there are only 2 numbers 0 and 1, with 0 representing and "Off" and 1 representing an "On". when you translate binary numbers into decimal you end up with each digit represting a multiple of 2.    EG:    Binary:       0001 / 0010 / 0011 / 0100 / 0101 / 0110 / 0111 / 1000  Represents: 1     /    2   /    3   /     4  /     5   /     6  /     7  /    8|`|HYk5jhnqaa	the answer is:    2 ^ 10    Calculate it as "power of 2"  It's because it's calculated as binary numbers  Also, a Megabyte is, of course 2 ^ 20

p6xgtONXaa	Hi,    Basically the more memory the vid card has the quicker in can process changes in display requirements, otherwise it will have to swap out the memory to the hard drive, similar to the swap file on your pc.    So go for the card with more memory.    256 MB of memory is, at the time of writing this, about the minimum for a gamer looking for a new card. When it comes to memory, more is always better, although it does raise the price of the card. 512 MB cards are now common in all price ranges, but there are high-end cards with 1 GB or more of memory onboard.      Arnak|`|Ha02Iu5Haa	i cant explain its here coz its jsut too time consuming, but i can summarise it in the following.    the more memory, the bigger the game you can run (talking about the requirements)|`|5Ctc1ohzaa	The more memory also = the higher the resolution the game can be run at as well as frames per second performance.

AA12262362	If your computer has bluetooth technology, there's a few ways to identify it. First, look around the edges of your laptop where your power light, HDD activity light, etc sit, and if there's a light with the symbol of BT it's possible your model has it... next, to attempt to enable it, hold the Function key "Fn" found between the left Control and left Windows key, and press Escape. See if that light you found earlier lights up. Another way to identify if your system has it, is go to "Start" => Control Panel and double click on "Bluetooth".|`|2tqmy6BYaa	there will be a wireless sign with a button kind of thing to enable and   disable it.|`|AA11256390	There's usually a 'function' key in a different color to the rest.

AA10106637	Yeah, vista has more "doing stuff in the background" than xp. So it takes alot of your ram. Increase you ram to like 2 or 3, it will solve the prob.|`|P0o52pqDaa	sorry but others have been complaining about vista. It tries to do too many things which makes everything collide and basically your whole computer goes crazy. =)|`|NysB7hOwaa	It will help with the problem though your PC may have the maximum it can handle.  Ignore people that say it is a problem with the coding of Vista - it is because people are using it at or near the minimum requirements.  1Gb used to be thought of as Adequate but it is just not even close to being enough even for the minimum version of Vista.    If you are capable of upgrading the minimum your should have for running windows Vista is really 2gb of ram and referably 3gb of ram.      If you have a 64bit PC then you can use more memory.  If you are using a laptop then you should try either 2gb or 4 gb - avoid a 1gb card and a 2 gb card.    If you have a 32gb desktop then go for 3 1gb cards - 32 bit windows cannot address more memory than this.      You will see a performance increase with extra memory because your PC will not need to page memory in and out.    If you are unsure of what configuration you have I suggest going to     www.crucial.com    their website can read your hardware and tell you what you have and what your PC is capable of handling and even bring up a price list - they are very competitive.

I would check with the Bsnl support services regarding the problem.    Arnak|`|AA12262362	The  1 reason I get questions like that is because of the operating system. Although Vista 32 and x64 look the same, the filesystem and the OS are totally different. 64 bit requires its own drivers; very rarely do you ever get a 32bit driver to coincide with x64. Contact your hardware vendor for a 64bit driver.

T7Apky52aa	First off, you want to start every program with:    use strict;  use warnings;    That's going to catch any errors you have with syntax right off the bat.    Splitting letters in to an array will make it easier to process than a hash. Plus with the hash you won't be able to guarantee that you have the same sort order that you have letters in.    Also, unless you're having to use a hash for this I'd consider using the tr substitution operator to do your work rather than all the if - elsif statements.    So I'd rewrite what you have with all the if then statement with this:    use strict;  use warnings;    my $letters = 'Test';    (my $serial = $letters) =~ tr/a-zA-Z/123456789012345678901234561234...    print $serial;    What it's doing is assigning the results of the tr (translation) of letters to serial. The a-zA-Z is shorthand for the letters a thru z, both capital and lower case. I'm assuming that you want the same number for both so you need to put the translation list of numbers in twice to get the correct results.    Hope that helps and feel free to e-mail if you have further questions.

To find out what you can add, determine the make and model of your computer, then visit a page from any memory maker, like PnY or SANDisk.

It's the amount of users that propagate viruses. Windows has about 90% of the market, Macs 10%. So Mac Viruses die out. The last MacOs X virus was 3 years ago and a whole 49 Macs got it before it died out. Unfortunately Mac users are as susceptible to greed and trickery as are Windows users. So the current group (not much a whole 6) of trojans make them self appealing to computers users by offering "free" versions of Photoshop & iWorks 09 via torrents. The free versions contain trojans to take over Macs or record credit card info etc. Add those to to the "fake" Mac anti-virus, malware remover, porn viewer, and poker game and you have maybe 40,000 Mac users with compromised Macs. There's a nice but long article below that explains all this.|`|KlRo6JLQaa	The only reason that macs are more secure is because they are obscure and the viruses do not propagate because of this.    Intel processors will not lead to viruses.|`|FG59GlkUaa	No, because pc's have viruses because they are running on Windows operating system, the os the common viruses built for. Even if mac have Intel procs., they will still run using mac os, so nothing will change except the performance|`|9019680d8ddcf225e537b2d9db41b654aa	As more people start using Mac's, you will see more Mac's with viruses & that's what happening now.    People who said Mac's cannot get a virus are fools.    People who using Mac's without protection are bigger fools.|`|f7P1uLQ7aa	no, because the virus is not hardware dependent . it doesn't depend on your processor or any other hardware.it will effect if you install windows on your MAC.
HXW4i5Ajaa	This has been bubbling around for a while now. I'll start with the two main types of broadband we use at the moment, and have a little grumble about the use of the term broadband as well while I am at it.    There are two types in use DSL and cable modems.    DSL is the use of an existing telephone line to provide data connectivity. This uses a cabling etwork that has been around for decades, and was not designed with this use in mind - hence why some people can get whizzo speeds, and others would be quicker using royal mail. There are two main flavours - there is the standard 8M type service that most people will be on, and a faster 24M service  (ADSL2+) available from BE and Eclipse and maybe a few others now.    I am reluctant to say "we are going as fast at the technology can" because we thought that when people were getting 2M! There will probably be more improvements, but I can't possibly predict how fast or when.    The likes of Virgin have a distinct advantage, as their cabling is much newer, and generally they have ducts from the box in the street to your house, so could blow a fibre to you if they felt so inclined.    That means they are using newer technologies, newer bits of wire etc, so higher speeds are easier.    Some of the talk is around the BT 21CN, but I doubt we will see any significant increase to the home for a few years yet - BT seem more interested in ADSL 2+.    My gripe about the use of the term broadband? It is now used to mean "high speed internet" where the term really means the provision of multiple servies on the same media.|`|AygEpMMaaa	if its from virgin u will get what they are saying as it comes through a direct cable not like sky,so yes,if u had 100meg of virgin thats what u would get|`|Yu7vBUkOaa	There are two reasons for a limit:    1 - your line can't support anything faster    In this case, nothing can help - but the 100mb trails need a different kind of cable anyway.    2 - you aren't paying for more then 8mb     In this case, the type of cable you use is irrelevant. The availability of 100mb broadband will drive prices down though.|`|b4xpwfCdaa	Well you can use it but it will still be restricted.

fda66a3825ca9cdd945fd0f771540bddaa	Basically, yes.  As an economic and political system, communism failed to allow goods and capital to move freely, principally through the combination of overly tight central control along with massive greed and corruption by those in power.  Physical goods require physical resources (labour, money, materials) to be made and distributed in a way that the 'knowledge' imparted by Wikipedia does not.  And, even if Wikipedia were to fail, no one would starve to death.|`|NbAGauDmaa	What|`|Zqg6OUXWaa	This is often used as an objection to Wikipedia, and there's an interesting series of responses, on Wikipedia, at "Wikipedia:Replies to common objections" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:R... >).

7ToeKBzYaa	Hi dude,    You can use Socket programming to make great chat rooms even like Yahoo Messenger.    You will need a chat server at server side and an client web application in your website, chat server will manage user's authentication and will transfer user messages.    In this case (using socket programming) you do not need any other external component and you'll play with your own needs, so you will be free to do everything you want.    good luck...|`|Zad4meNfaa	Try phpfreechat  http://www.phpfreechat.net/|`|VyGEfp72aa	If you used asynchronous server scripting or AJAX, you could embed the chat room inside your website. It could be as simple as creating an XML file for each chat room and others for the private chats, then when the SEND button is pushed the message is added to the XML file and the other members of the chat rooms pages update with the new message. Then you could make it as secure as you like.

First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.     3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.       4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.  Check your drivers.     5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly    http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...|`|L6BOtQ6haa	Try defrag and clean your registry. If this fails, format your hard drive and install your operating system fresh. 99% of the time this will fix the problem. If its still not working, then there is something physically wrong with the laptop, and you should send it in for repair.
mHXLJKzRaa	easy stuff there are many ways i'll tell you the first    1) -from the sound of your setup, sounds like you are connecting an ethernet cord to your desktop, and u cant connect it to the laptop  -buy a wireless router like linksys at walmart only $50 or so, plug that into your current internet modem (if u have cable high speed internet, the wireless internet will be fast)  -let your laptop connect to the internet via its wireless capability and leave your desktop in connected to the ethernet. if you want, u can install a wireless adapter (buy a PCI type cause its common but check ur motherboard to see if you have an extra PCI slot) which will let your desktop also have wireless    -so basically since you bought the wireless router, your whole house has wifi, and you can connect to your internet via computer, psp, mp3 player, etc, etc, and just setup a security for your internet once you're done so no one else uses your internet for free. if you need more help just ask.        and to your other question: no both cannot access the one virus software program, u have to install it individually. as of right now, both cannot access the internet but if you buy the router, then your whole house will have internet, and u can connect your laptop via its wifi which im sure it has if its new and use your desktop to connect via an ethernet cord, also you can make your desktop wireless via above method which i mention.|`|j5o5qYmpaa	You can't Connect the desktop and the laptop to the internet at the same time (you should consider buying a Wireless router) oh,yeah you can't transport the virus program ether, sorry|`|f1i6DPHFaa	I don't know what you would do to connect the two, but you can always use the product key you received when you purchased your virus program and install it onto the laptop as well.|`|9vP0elUIaa	well, to connect the two computers together you need a crossover cable.  you will not be able to share internet from the one computer to the next through the crossover cable though.  you can, however, download a free antivirus software such as AVG or Avira Antivir and put it on the computer that needs it.  as for the internet problem you will need a separate ethernet cable.|`|Z1FYjWmJaa	First thing you'll need is a router. If you plan on connecting to the internet wireless on your laptop, you'll need a wireless router. If you plan on having a wired connection, you'll need a regular router and another ethernet cord. If you want virus protection on both computers (not necessary, but recommended), you'll need a copy on each computer

PWIDfHwBaa	we're in a cyber world, where you don't know what your neighbour's name is but you know the bra size of a girl living on the opposite side of the world from you. with generation x and y growing up, this is how they interact.  For you it maybe hard to comprehend as in your young days you would have had more of a physical social life. these days everything is done over the internet.      sharing person information about yourself does sound kinda stupid, but people being as sexually active these days as they are, cant really waste time in finding out who a person really is but just want to get straight to the point, there isn't enought "time" left in a day whereas earlier there was pleasure in sitting down and talking to one another finding out all different asepcts of their life. these days its pretty much only one.    "I cant see what these websites do for anyone"  in a nut shell... all they do is help the newer generations meet others far away and show themselves over a 'cyber' world and for the elder people, it helps them interact with family across the globe.    like i said, just being the generation you were brought up in, might make it really hard for you to find this "normal" but it is so for the newer generations!    lol :)|`|R1zUIh7taa	I use it to stay in touch with my family!

b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	The first difference you will notice is that Vista 64-bit can handle a lot more RAM than Vista 32-bit. It also requires drivers designed specifically for it rather than the 32-bit version. However, in theory it is the better operating system & is certainly a lot more stable & less fiddly than XP-64bit ever was!|`|d97e0d7c192c0cd5634d474777b47535aa	Unless you're going to be running a lot of programs simultaneously, getting the X64 version is pointless. You won't notice any difference between the two. Also the 32-bit version supports 64-bit processors, multi-core and multiple processor motherboards. The amount of RAM you are limited to is chipset based, not OS based.|`|JKLQgjyTaa	There are many differences. It supports 64-bit processors and can support more RAM. I'm pretty sure there's more just google it.|`|Bj12jAiiaa	from what I have read some programs don't run on 64-bit and alot of drivers don't work with 64-bit. I just recently bought my first Windows Vista 64-bit computer and all of the programs I had and my last computer work fine on this one. The only problem I had was getting my printer to work with this computer. The drivers on the cd didn't work so I had to download new ones from the interent, but it wansn't a big deal, took me like 15 min to get it working. Overall I wouldn't worry too much about it.

tXpcpAG3aa	Scotty has it right for a comparison, but to be more exact it is a card that has multiple 1394 (firewire) connection inputs and installs using a PCI slot sometimes an X1 slot dependent on manufacturer. But it is not solely used for cameras, many devices use these inputs, I have a printer that uses one, also mp3 players, a couple of VOIP phones I have seen, network adapters, hardware for firewalls, you get the idea, it has a lot of uses, but it really depends on the availability of items that use this type of connection, and whether or not you will use it often enough to warrant the installation of one of the cards. Most computers come with one or two of these connections already built into the system.

There is Firewire 400 and Firewire 800.  Firewire 400 is about the same speed as USB 2.0.  Firewire 800 is double the speed of FW400/USB 2.0.    Firewire 400 exists on a bunch of camcorders/professional cameras for connecting to your computer.  It is also used on a variety of external hard drives.  It was co-invented by Apple.    There is also now eSata (and eSata cards).  It is about 4x faster than Firewire 800.  It is really only around on external hard drives/external RAID boxes.  Its fairly rare, but is growing in popularity.

hVXTOL4Daa	Your memory modules have gone bad.  Memtest is supposed to test your memory heavily to detect for hardware defects.    If you have more than one stick of Memory, take out one and run the Memtest again.  If it doesnt lock up, the other stick of memory is the one that's gone bad.    If your computer is a laptop, remove the battery and the disconnect it from the mains, before you take out the stick of Memory.    You'll need to buy new ones to replace any defective memory.  Consult your manual for the motherboard at your vendor/motherboard manufacturer's website for compatible Memory Modules.|`|AA12262362	As much as I'd love to believe that it doen't happen, I have seen RAM chips go bad and lock up while doing a memory test. You can have a 1GB stick, and 993MB of the chip be good, but when that last 7MB is attempted to be accessed, lock up. Sounds like a bad RAM chip.

dkpIjt5jaa	Don't nuke it (too harsh) unless this complete solution does not work !    This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|tVWWL9KTaa	Spyware Guard 2009 (SpywareGuard 2009)  approbates new methods in suggesting or rather scaring users to pay for fake antispyware. Fortunately, this does not work in every case. So, what is that original invention in Spyware Guard 2009? That is its blocking of hundreds popular websites including Google, Yahoo and MSN.

The only thing user-upgradeable is the RAM and the hard drive. If it's really old, you may not even get compatible components easily.     Assuming you have Windows XP, you can try a software cleanup and tuning like this:    (1) Run a FULL anti-virus scan with a good virus scanner. Get free editions of AVast or AVG8. Use the latest virus definitions file. But don't run install more than one anti-virus at the same time.    (2) Run anti-spyware scans with Spybot S&D and malwarebytes.    (3) Ensure all Microsoft security updates are applied.    (4) Run disk cleanup to delete old temp files and other junk    (5a) Run chkdsk once to scan for file system errors.http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265    (5b) Run  a thorough disk defrag. Use a good defragmenter for this, and also run a boot-time defrag to fix the MFT and page file if they are fragmented. You can check out Diskeeper 2009, which is widely acknowledged to be the best defragger around. Their website has free 30-day trial versions. http://www.diskeeper.com    (6) Disable unnecessary background processes and services that take up memory.    (7) Make sure all the hardware components have the latest and most stable drivers. Video card performance in particular is strongly dependent on drivers.

f49ZZ8ILaa	Pro Tools is most commonly used for sound FX and foley creation and editing. As far as actually creating the sound effects you capture any sounds that you might need using whatever mic set up you have access to, or a sound library. Then use a sound program like Pro Tools to edit and distort your sounds till you get the sound you are looking for. In pro tools you can also view your video in the time line along with the sounds so you can actually see when your effects will be playing. That's why I like it for animation. You can also play your animation or video and  record  into the program directly at the same time which makes it especially useful for ADR (voice over).|`|QY48ErA3aa	MAAYA|`|YvSd553Jaa	a lot of movies dont have a software for sounds.    i know for star wars on side was cars going past a long pipe @the end was a mic|`|BjRKCXhsaa	For Sound Effect U Must Know About SOUND FOURGE -> A Sound Editing Progrom From SONY    If U Want To Mix Animation In An Video, U Have Know About ADOBE PREMERE & AFTER EFFECTS FROM ADOBE....|`|qj7YinVcaa	they are couple music creation softwares that movie company used to make sound effects.

Also go into Network Connections and edit the properties of "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" to say "obtain automatically". Also try clicking "Repair" on the Network Connection support page.

Mine sorta over heated..and it doesn't smell to great when fried.    2. It could mean you need more RAM if you have at least 1G then your fine.    3. As far as your HDD it depends on how full it is. Doubt it would heat up your computer though if it was pretty full.|`|1cDBxIxoaa	You definitely should open it up and clean it out. With alot of dust in there it could cause some bad problems, worse than what you have now.    For the upgrade, get memory.

dJUaACflaa	Well, USB stands for Universal Serial Bus.  The advantage with USB devices such as Mouse, Keyboards and Speakers are that you can "Hot Plug" or "Hot Swap" them - which is very handy for something like a mouse.     In the days of PS2 Ports, you would have to shutdown the computer, swap them out then boot again - this was a problem especially working with Servers when a mouse or keyboard failed. Trying to swap them out while it was running, could cause the whole machine to lock up. These days with USB Devices you just plug and unplug...no shutdown required.    So, what are they? Beautiful - that's what they are!|`|ye1tS9a2aa	their what you plug into your computer, they are those rectangular shaped plug thingys|`|9f8XoDKJaa	Use the wiki link for USB

I don't get the 20 Mhz business, however.  You must be talking about the old fashioned multiplier you had to set manually at one time (which is not set on-the-fly by auto-detection).

p6xgtONXaa	Hi,    The 64bit card has it's own processor so it won't matter that your pc has a 32bit operating system.    What you need to check is if the card will fit in your motherboard and that you have the right power supply to be able to run the card.    A lot of older pc's had a fairly low power psu, the new vid card need more power and sometimes need a different power connector.    Arnak

As explained from other members here, insert the system recovery disks if you have these and follow the instructions. This will completely remove all existing Windows XP profiles and will restore your laptop back to factory state after a full system restore.    It is also very likely that your laptop is not capable of working with Windows XP as a result of insufficient system resources on your laptop which is one reason why your laptop is not preforming at its optimum proficiency.|`|ARfxEH0qaa	Your laptop vendor might have given you Windows ME OS.

Most companies I have dealt with have tech chat help 24/7 so if you really want to know research it through the manufacturer. On a personal note I have never voided a warranty by overclocking a graphics card, only CPU's. If the product description talks about it's overclock ability you may be safe, but very few products boast about how far their product can be pushed. Also, don't push it all at once, over clock a little at a time. As soon as you start seeing errors or funky behavior of the screen, back it down and leave it in a safe range. ATI has a nice interface to control the amount you can overclock their cards, so utilize it. Good Luck.

Wi1SmfkTaa	It's not only OK to use both a hardware firewall and a software firewall, it's recommended. Your hardware firewall provides NAT which separates your network from the internet, and should be checking packets on their way in to make sure they're legitimate. Your software firewall should be checking not only inbound traffic, but also outbound traffic. This is important so that if a rogue application gets installed you should be notified of unusual behavior.    What you must never do is simultaneously use two software firewalls. They might be working at odds with one another.    To put it into perspective having a hardware firewall and a software firewall is like having a door on your porch as well as the front door. To get into the house you have to pass the doorman at both doors, in other words two levels of security.    On the other hand having two software firewalls is like having two different front doors. The doorman A doesn't know what doorman B is doing. You might have one door open and the other closed.    So, hardware + software firewall good, two software firewalls bad.    /|`|i16PJNvcaa	i,m gonna take a rough guess, so one would possibly stop the other from loading plus  you would run into endless problems, but don't quote me on that, lol

IIUqe4m0aa	As Colin says, the laptops will either have static IP addresses or are being handed IP addresses via DHCP.      If they are static addresses then you need to specify a different IP address for each one (with the same subnet mask and default gateway).    If DHCP then something is wrong with the setup.  It should hand out different addresses to each network device which requests one.    The only other thing I can think of is that they are set to receive addresses from DHCP but there is no DHCP server and so they are using autoconfiguration addresses (which begin 169.254. . .) and managing to generate the same one.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	Unless they have 2 network cards running they can not generate 2 addresses, if this is the case you MUST disconnect one of the cards from the network.

The Google headquarters, the Googleplex, is located in Mountain View, California. As of December 31, 2008, the company has 20,222 full-time employees.  Google was co-founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were students at Stanford University and the company was first incorporated as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. The initial public offering took place on August 19, 2004, raising US$1.67 billion, making it worth US$23 billion. Google has continued its growth through a series of new product developments, acquisitions, and partnerships. Environmentalism, philanthropy and positive employee relations have been important tenets during the growth of Google, the latter resulting in being identified multiple times as Fortune Magazine's  1 Best Place to Work. The unofficial company slogan is "Don't be evil", although criticism of Google includes concerns regarding the privacy of personal information, copyright, censorship and discontinuation of services. According to Millward Brown, it is the most powerful brand in the world.

They hypothesized that a search engine that analyzed the relationships between websites would produce better ranking of results than existing techniques, which ranked results according to the number of times the search term appeared on a page. Their search engine was originally nicknamed "BackRub" because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site. A small search engine called Rankdex was already exploring a similar strategy.  Convinced that the pages with the most links to them from other highly relevant web pages must be the most relevant pages associated with the search, Page and Brin tested their thesis as part of their studies, and laid the foundation for their search engine. Originally, the search engine used the Stanford University website with the domain google.stanford.edu. The domain google.com was registered on 15 September 1997, and the company was incorporated as Google Inc. on 4 September 1998 at a friend's garage in Menlo Park, California. The total initial investment raised for the new company amounted to almost US$1.1 million, including a US$100,000 check|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Google    (g'g?l)  Pronunciation Key    A trademark used for an Internet search engine.

AA12262362	That beep you hear is a system error beep. Unsure of what brand you have, I can't really give you guidance. My advice: Remove your RAM, your video card, and any other add-ins.

32XqpAD0aa	Take into consideration that web hosting is a global service. It does not matter what country you are located in; US, UK, Canada, Australia or India. It is good to note that the cost of hosting services in most countries is generally a little more expensive in comparison to the same services in Canada and the United States. Specifically, American web hosts offer a much better value for money than any local hosting.    If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.

Sometimes folks have computer problems.    Second, you should know what you're doing before you sell on eBay.  eBay has not allowed sellers to give negative feedback for quite some time now.  All you can do is start the 'Non-paying bidder' process, which, after 7 days goes by with no action taken by the buyer, you can close the case and get your final value fees returned. The buyer gets an unpaid item strike, which may or may not affect their ability to buy on eBay in the future. But you need to allow more time before you begin the process.    If you didn't already know these things, you shouldn't be selling on eBay.  Take the time to study the system and its policies before doing any more selling.|`|8y9yOnj9aa	Yes i think if you dont get your payment or hear from him by friday you should deffinately give him negative feedback.

However, this is vista we are talking about, microsoft's biggest pile of trash ever.  Windows 7 is coming out and it's much better than vista is.  Most vista comps come with 1gb or more of ram in the computer, if you have a bunch of other programs running in the background, it might be taking up more ram than your comp can handly with the game on.  go into your task manager and disable anything you don't need on your comp and see if it works, if not, then you will probably have to increase your ram.

KlRo6JLQaa	Application specific guides and tutorials will not teach you to be an all round computer expert.  If you wish to dedicate yourself to becoming a geek, an expert, a power user or whatever else you would call it, an intimate understanding of the machine and its mysteries is required.  To accomplish this you will need to master the abstract as well as spend enough time with a broad range of specific subjects to learn what they are capable of.    The first thing that you want to do is to plot out your resources.  Where do you go when you want to find out how something works?  There are many different options here, but you will come to find that the best resources for starting off are in print.   How do you know what different programs do if you dont have them? The best solution to these problems is through the downloading of warez. Browse through google and previously answered questions on Yahoo to find out how to download programs / books / etc.    Learn to appreciate the short comings of computers and learn to work with them.  Know your operating system and tinker with it, dont be afraid to mess things up.  If you get more and more into modifying your operating system, I would recommend an open source operating system.   Be prepared to lose data, you must go through the worst to get to the best of times.  Learn to back up your data.  Learn how the hardware in your computer works; a good place to start is to read course material for the A+ certification, (a common certification for I.T. www.comptia.org) you can find this material through the methods illustrated in the previous paragraph.  Learn how the software in your computer works (I dont mean how to operate it).  This is harder to answer and also ties in with hardware.  You can find information about software through programming and discrete math.  Computer science is an important topic, but it is more complex and should be covered later on.      After you become familiar with what you are working with you can become more specific with what you are doing.   Make your own website, learn HTML and CSS, but dont make a special point in memorizing everything about it.  Learn how to set up a server with Apache or IIS and host a website off of your computer for your friends.  Learn how to setup an FTP server to share files.  Learn to use server side scripting. Learn about databases and database management.  Learn about networking and its associated protocols and hardware. Learn what malware does and how to remove it (you know that .exe that you got in an email? Have you ever tried running it?).  Learn to program. (LISP and C  are good starting languages.) If you are not enjoying programming, move on, however, you should learn the basics before doing so.  Learn Linux and bash, learn to compile an operating system.   Learn to use text only programs.  Learn to use outdated computers.  Learn to build and upgrade computers.  Learn about how to use encryption, firewalls and other forms of security.  Make graphics with Photoshop, make 3d models with 3dmax.  Learn to edit movies.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, I will cover how to find more to learn in the next paragraph.    Computers are very complex and as such one of the hardest things to know is what you dont know.  My list of basic skills for any computer geek is quite accomplishable, yet each one of those subjects could demand a lifetime of dedication.  One of the easiest ways to find of new things to study is to READ, browsing Wikipedia can be quite productive when searching for the unknown.  Another way is to SHARE, join a forum or any community, hang out on the IRC networks and listen to what others have to say, tell them what you are doing and what you are trying to accomplish.  Try researching questions that are asked on yahoo and answering them.  Help your friends; make friends in real life that are into computers.  Try to fix broken systems.  The internet is the ultimate source of information for computer related studies.    Being a computer geek isnt a lifestyle as some geeks like to think it is its merely a title associated with a hobby. Best of luck to you and your studies, if you have any problems or questions about my answer please feel free to email me.|`|GYkOoQwAaa	Computer can be learned by practice there is no specific way but it is better to not be a computer geek cuz that will heart your back,eyes and cause headache, so go to sites which gives u benefits like this site u ll enjoy ur time in asking and answewering wot u? but never west you intire time on computer..  good luck|`|PWIDfHwBaa	it'll all happen over time. dont force yourself to do anything, play with programmes and software your not familiar with.    a "geek" is pretty mcuh someone who has spent way to much time on a computer and can sit away from a computer and pretty much make a comic book on how to do stuff on a cmoputer as they have used programmes so much so that they have a vivid picture in their head.    all you need to do is familiarise, and that can only be done over time. dnot rush, no need for that :) and like the person said, ask questions here if needed.|`|exSVTrtjaa	When I was 6 and first used a computer, all I knew how to do was use WordPad to type random things. After doing that for some time, I learnt how to change the font color, size, etc. This happens with a lot of things. For about 4/5 years my family computer had Windows 98 on it, and when we upgraded to XP, I didn't know how to use it. But after playing around with things to see what they do, I learnt. The same thing happened when I switched to Mac after using Windows for 8 years. If I am having trouble working out software, I google it. Or if I get an error, I google it. Then next time I get the error, I know how to fix it.  You just need to teach yourself by trying new things, and by googling.   =]

It usually depends on what was detected first. For example, if you have a floppy drive, when you install Windows, it will detect that first and assign the letter A. When it detects your hard drive or first partition, it will assign the letter C. CD/DVD drives are usually D or E, but can vary. Portable things like iPods or flash drives are generally E, F, G, or H, but will go higher.

IIUqe4m0aa	The crucial scanner above is good, although not always totally accurate.    The best way is to open the computer and have a looksee at the RAM inside, it should have a sticker on it giving various details including the type of the RAM eg DDR2 PC3200 200MHz or whatever.  More importantly you'll be able to see how many spare RAM slots you've got left!|`|eSodtiniaa	Click on this link.

You will have to add a TableModel to gain references or design your own TableClass made of JLabels.    JTable is complex, at first, but it does allow RowEdits, which JList does not.

4ZMhe9IVaa	It's very simple:  you just have to print the data comma separated, one line for each array.  Ex. x[]={1,3,5,6,7,8} y[]={3,4,5,6,7,8};  the print will be:  1,3,5,6,7,8  3,4,5,6,7,8    then you can copy and paste this kind of data in excel, it will recognise the format (CSV).Also you can save the data in CVS file and open them in Excel.    I used a "copy and paste technique" in my project and it worked very good.    Ciao|`|AA11134471	save the results to a .CSV file with the values separated by a comma and each line that you want in excel separated by a newline.    example:    array1[4] = {1,2,3,4};  array2[4] = {5,6,7,8};    save them to a file like this:  1,2,3,4  5,6,7,8    when you click on the file it will automatically open in excel.    or you could have your program open it by using the _spawn() functions. see the link below on how to use it.

AA11514979	Have you tried another internet browser, or have you tried using the torrent of the Linux distro (I've never used Suse, just most distributions have a torrent that's legal).    Use 7zip or WinRAR to extract the .RAR file and see if it gives you a ISO file.  If it's a .ISO file that for whatever reason is showing up as a .RAR, go ahead and change the file extension.      Pro Tip:  Use KDE 3.5 or 4.2   Don't use 4.0 or 4.1 unless you want headaches.    There's a few other distributions that use KDE.  Kubuntu is one, though I believe they use KDE 4.0.  It's basically Ubuntu with KDE instead of Gnome.      A lot of people for first time distros use Ubuntu, Fedora (basically a beta for Red Hat Enterprise Linux), or OpenSUSE|`|exSVTrtjaa	It is actually an ISO, but when you install winRAR it sets itself to the default program to open ISOs.

8bEts7uPaa	There are a variety of DVD creation software packages out there.

"Burn" is record to DVD. "Rip" is copy DVD video to your PC. You want to burn a DVD.

8ad580cd99c0cf921506c236e4e80b8faa	I would say the greatest advantage of Chrome over Firefox is its ability to handle tabs in independent processes which means a browser or plugin bug, or an incorrectly coded web page cant take down the whole browser, but just that tab or plugin alone. This architecture also enables the cool task manager which as noted by John Resig, lets once and for all be able to know whether it is the browser or a badly coded web site the responsible for a slow down.    There is a noticeable memory overhead but whats the point of having 1 GB or 2 GB of RAM if youre going to care about 200 or 300MB. Slim is always good, but snappy is even better.    Then there is the really slick theme: no main menu, the status bar is overlaid at the bottom when needed, just like the find bar; there is no search bar which is integrated with the location bar, it has a new tab button, it has cool animations when accessing the bookmarks toolbar or moving tabs which definitely helps feel the browser more responsive.    Its private mode, Incognito, sounds like a nice to have rather than a must have feature for me, but with its implementation along with Microsofts and Apples, its definitely becoming a standard feature just like antiphishing protection.    It scores a 79/100 in the Acid 3 test (ahead of Firefox 3 (75/100) and behind Firefox 3.1 nightlies (85/100). In the Sunspider JavaScript benchmark, it clearly beats Firefox 3.0.1: 3700ms vs 5100ms in my Dell Inspiron 6400 (2GHz Centrino Duo, 2GB RAM).    Another positive thing is what Google didnt do: they havent stuffed it with Google applications integration: there is no Gmail integration (or any other web mail service), Google Reader, Google Docs, Gtalk, etc. Google is of course the default search engine but you can easily change it to any other provider. Of course this is just a beta, and Google integration may be already in the plans, but its good to know that there is Chromium, the open source project from where Chrome is derived, so developers will be able to modify it as needed.    What Chrome is missing from Firefox? Well, thats a much longer list that of course starts with the lack of extensibility in the sense Firefox provides it: a way to make the browser do whatever you can imagine, to the point of making it a completely different application like FireFTP or Pencil do.    As said before, I think Google will try to bundle Google Gadgets and present it as the way of customizing the browser, but of course it would be as limited as developers found when Apple announced the same for the first iPhone.    What else? Hold tight. In no particular order: there is no tab overflow handling, no tagging or smart bookmarks handling, no download resume between sessions, no multiple dictionary support, no toolbar customization beyond hiding the Home button and the bookmarks toolbar, the bookmarks toolbar is only accessible via Ctrl + B, no kind of web feeds support, no native video/audio support, no discontinuous selection option, no page printing options, etc.    The list goes on but since its a beta we can expect to see some of these features added, completed or corrected before the final release. Or not. This is Google and the final release may never come so I think if Google doesnt provide a roadmap soon (ha!), we can treat (and beat) this as Chrome 1.0.    Conclusion    I like Google Chrome, and I believe it will be able to take a significant slice of the browsers market pie, hopefully mostly at the expense of Internet Explorer, but it remains to be seen.    While I dont find it strong enough to beat with Firefox, it is definitely a yummy option for the hundreds of millions of Google users who will be prompted to install it through a web search results page, or any of the several Google products. Which at this point in time I think is fine. The web only benefits of more and more competition but my concern in the long term is: where do Google stop?    After all Google is a public company, and all its good public benefit intentions are second to those of their shareholders at best.    Features aside (they can always be copied, even extensibility) the main difference between Chrome and Firefox, both being open source projects, is what company stands behind and their mission. Mozilla is a public benefit organization, cares about the Internet and the Internet alone, which as noble, good and idealistic as it sounds, I still have to see any evidence that proves the opposite.    It has struggled in the past for sticking to its mission. Today it enjoys success for the exact same reason, in large part because of a business partner like Google, which is not the same as saying that Mozilla would die  without Google: be sure there is no lack of companies interested in reaching 200 million users, daily.|`|a42c0cbe296fc23ce84147b6dbb01a72aa	I like yahoo and I did use Chrome but didn't like so I am again using Yahoo.

Usually your speed will be much slower than that.  Plus with downloading you are dependent on the speed of the connection of the computer you are downloading from too.

Okay, you got 5mb speed, but what your upload/download speeds, they combine them to make the 5mb.

10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	There are about 65,000 ports in use on tcp/ip (internet). You don't use port settings for "better internet connection".  You use ports and port forwarding for specific services, such as games, ftp servers, web servers etc. You don't need to configure ports for everyday use, in fact having ports forwarded in your router may actually SLOW other services down.    You may need to adjust the MTU (max transmission units) in the router but generally the automatic settings work just fine.    Faster internet is controlled by your ISP!  So to get faster or better service subscribe to a better service level.
