20081002102748AALIyzM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 2 year old does not sit for story time!?	Granted 2 year old children don't sit for long at all, but I am trying to have my daughter around other children, so we go to the local library to listen to a few books being read. My daughter is the ONLY child that is running around playing with the toys, talking to the fish, putting crayons on the floor..she has absolutely NO interest in the woman reading the books to the group of toddlers. She runs around the entire time.    I talk to her and tell her to sit down like the other children, but she starts whining, screaming, and crying and I hate to inturrupt everyone else's time. I feel that I am unable to control her! She's very independent, but she is crossing the line. I am so embarrassed at her behavior. She listens to me most of the time, and I do put her in time out when she misbehaves, but I do not know what to do at the library.    Nice and useful suggestions would really help me. Thank you for your time.

20081008210607AAVOP6I	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I don't want bullying to start again.....?	I have always been bullied up to last year the 9th grade. I haven't been bullied since mid of last year and now I am being bullied again by mean kids in 9th grade who bullied me in 8th grade as well and someone in my Bible class....what does that tell you about this school? Kids can be mean. I try to be nice to everyone but they are mean to me. I am tired of being picked on and teased especially by the person in bible class. What happens during lunch when it's hot? You get hot. -.- I'm not going to go to the bathroom and apply a stick of deoderant to myself just because the first couple minutes I am somewhat sweaty. It's not awful, no one even notices it but her. It makes me sad and makes me want to cry. I don't stand up for myself like I should and I have trouble communicating out loud. The 9th graders bully me because I am shy and used to be considered a "teachers pet." They bully me because they know I don't stand up for myself so they take advantage of me.       I want to ask Mr. Carl my Bible teacher if I can sit somewhere else tomorrow.       What will make bullying not start to happen to me again? I really don't want to be bullied.......

20090105073028AA3EdO1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does anyone know what this could be..?	Hi everyone      I just have a question about cramping – I got my last period on 12th December, it was 6 days late, and only lasted about 2 days, not very heavy but very intense cramps. Then it stopped and I have had light cramps every day ever since.. I don’t think I could be pregnant, because although it was very quick and light, I did get a period last month. I had a little sickness a few days ago which lasted about 3 days, but I suppose this could be blamed on a bug or something. Does anyone know what could be going on with my body? I am due my next period on the 9th of this month.      Thanks in advance...

20090205094358AAJxiqq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I think I may be  PREGNANT!?  (UPDATE)?	Alright, I haven't had my period in 47 days....MEANING i'm 16 days late on my period from a normal cycle. My period has NEVER been late before, it's only been too early almost every time or normal.      On the 7th day, I took a "1st Response" pregnancy test, and it read "negative". So I decided to wait a week and take the other. On the 16th day, I took the other one, and it also read "negative". It was one line that was very dark.      I spotted for 3-4 days about a week ago, then stopped. The spotting was a brownish color the whole time.      For the last couple nights, i've felt sickish, but then it goes away. I've noticed i've gained weight in my stomach and sides, but it might just be me.      I've also been VERY picky on what I want to eat for the past week. My nipples have been very sensitive to the touch, and i've had light pains around the uterus area. I've been stressed, and quite moody lately as well, but I try and calm down.      My last period was on December 21st....I had sex with my fiance on December 27th, and again on January 2nd or 3rd I believe (unprotected) and those times were the last time he "came" in me. This has happened often before (unprotected sex) with him for the past two and a half years that we've been togeather, but I NEVER got pregnant any of those times, so I thought one of us was sterile, until now, somethings changed.      Could the pregnancy tests be wrong or are they most likely right, and somethings wrong with me?

20090204180514AAnTI3U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How to ease teething pains?	my almost 5 month old is teething very bad, nothing calms him. i have tried frozen, refrigerated, and vibrating teethers and he wants no part of it. i have given him the maximum amount of teething tablets reccomended by the bottle. nothing. oragel-he screams. he hates it, but that has been for 2 months since he started teething.. teething drops-he won't swallow them. tylenol drops aren't helpin either. he was able to swallow them and that was over an hour ago-not working. he won't take his bottle or paci either. he won't play or anything or focus when ppl are talking to him. i even tried mylocon in case he had gas that was bothering him too. he did not change. he crys and arches his back. he will settle down if i walk around the house w/ him but not for long. are there any other remedies i can use? he hates cold things in his mouth and warm things too. he only likes thing room temp. he won't even let me massage his gums. what next?

20090205121020AA6LTAZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	This is a weird question about my period?	Ok, this might seem confusing, but here goes...I was on the ortho evra patch for only a month and a half, but one day it fell off in the shower the day before I was supposed to take it off.  (keep in mind, this was my 2nd patch in the pack I didn't wait to put the 3rd one on and I quit)  The next day, I got my period, due to me taking the patch off so early.  Here's the tricky part though, if I would've kept using the patch, my peak fertility time would've been from January 18-24.  I don't know what it is now or if it still was during that time, but anyways, my bf and I had sex on the 19th and he pulled out, but he shocked me when about 3 minutes after coming, he put it back in, catching me offguard and I kind of freaked out because i knew that he could still have sperm on it since he didnt wash up or shower or anything.  Anyway, my period was a week and 3 days late, it started off light and now it's light-moderate or whatever and it looks like it's about to stop and it's only been 2 days.  I'm really scared because that never happens.  Another thing that has me scared is that I've been mildly nauseous and having moodswings that I can't control.  I hate it.  Anyways, I checked  a website and it said that if I am pregnant, I would be 4 weeks.  I took 2 pregnancy tests on tuesday.  Both were negetive and I was happy until I found out that my family has a history of having false negetive tests and having periods during pregnancy.  I don't have insurance to go to the doctor, any advice?

20090205094510AA3dOpF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does this sound like a miscarriage?	At the end of Sept 08 I started to develop a very odd smell "down there". I also never had an actual period, only spotting. About one week ago i finally had money to go to my family doctor. They took my urine a tested it for a urinary tract infection, but not a pregnancy test. Over the past few months, I myself took 4 tests, 3 of which were positive and one was negative. Then I did have an actual period, so I assumed that I wasn't pregnant, but yet the foul odor was getting worse. So, when I went to the Dr.'s a week ago she did a vaginal examine and assumed I must have an infection, but needed to do a test, because the medicine was very strong. I went into the bathroom again and was pushing very hard to pee, while doing so, I could feel a large mass coming out of me. It was a large shiny white mass of tissue that was about the size of a chicken egg. I went and got the Dr. to look at it, She made no deal about it and flushed the toilet. Now, almost immediately the odor is gone, and I feel completely normal again. I also know that it was not a tampon, because I don't wear them. Please help anyone. Thanks in Advance!

20090205123408AAxeK2v	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I'm pregnant, and really uncomfortable with the idea of breastfeeding. What should I do?	I understand the benefits of breastfeeding, and they GREATLY outweigh those of formula. And please don't think of me as immature for this, but I originally didn't want children, so I never thought anything of breastfeeding ever. But, I changed my mind, and I want a couple. So, I'm pregnant now (only 7 weeks and 3 days), and I know I have time to think this over.. but the idea of breastfeeding just seems so awkward and bothersome to me. I don't know how to get over it. I thought about just expressing it so my baby can still get the nutrients from the milk, but what I am going to do if I'm away from an extra bottle? I've just always viewed my breasts as something that I get excitement from, not a food source. I really want to do want to be comfortable with it. My mother nursed my siblings and me, but I just don't want to feel like the world is watching me do this. Any advice?

This pregnancy is much different then my first time so I am a little confused cause this never has ever happened before. My husband and I were having sex doggy style, he had just climaxed when we both felt a 'pop' deep inside. it hurt for a split second and then was fine. For a few minutes afterward it felt heavy.. in there... and then it was like nothing had ever happened. there was no blood or amniotic fluid, like i have said, this has never happened before and my question is: Has this happened to anyone else?

20090205105301AAZJFDu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did you ever tell your mom about your abortion?	I had to have an abortion at a little over 5 weeks due to a medical risk. I feel awful because it's a decision I didn't want to have to follow thru with and I feel doubly guilty because I am 23 and my mom is always telling everyone.."I have good girls, they are working, behave, try hard in college, aren't pregnant, aren't on drugs, aren't running the streets.." And I know she's talking well about us and doesn't mean harm...but I keep thinking..geesh..when I have kids I will probably be 30 (financially I can't afford them sooner :(  ). And here my mom will be saying things like " My daughter is so good because she was responsible and waited"...and what she doesn't know is...I'm not that "good". I got pregnant on accident when I was 22 and could have been a mother, just like her, at a very young age. (She had me at 21). If I didn't have medical risks I would have had my baby..then what? What would I be?      Has anyone confessed this to their moms? I feel TERRIBLE because she only has me and my sister and I just recently found out my sis had an ab. at 17. I feel like...God, my mom will think she is an awful mother if she ever finds that out..and I have already let her down so much and she still takes up for me and loves me. But moms always think they didn't raise their kids right you know?      HELP :(

20090205101353AAdXXR8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Many questions from a 1st time pregnant mum to be!?	Notes: I'm 23 days past my LMP.      1) I'm reading some pregnancy stuff.. and it says you get implantation bleeding in your third week, although I read it can be 14 days. I got mine at 17 days. Is this okay? (It was pink and brown spotting but I had a little bright red bleeding.      2) I know I'm pregnnat, but I'm cramping, may be ovulation? It has occured on both sides today. This is confusing me, because I didn't think you ovulated when you were already pregnant?      3) Is it harmful to do sit ups while pregnant?      4) How much coffee is too much for a baby?      5) How many extra kcals are you meant to eat while pregnant?      6) When I get all my cramps, is it okay to just take paracetemol/iburofen?      7) Is it usual for your boobs to itch.. but also feel like they're being pinched at occasionally?      8) Do you sweat more?      Sorry for so many questions! Any help will be thanked for.

20090205112215AAWy7s0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can I get pregnant if I started taking birth control pills a few days before my period?	i am currently taking birth control pills, i have been using them for a few months   already but i stopped using them since i was not gonna be doing any sexual activity with   my boyfriend because he went on a trip for 2 months. i am regular in my period and i had my    last period on Dec 17 and was supposed to get my next period on Jan 15. the thing is that   i started my pack of pills just 4 days before my period and they stopped my period from coming.   during the first week of taking the pills i missed 2 pills every other day. that means i   took 2 pills for 2 days.i was not having sex with my boyfriend when i missed the pills but   he came back 4 days after i was taking the pills correctly. so, when i was having sexual   activity with my boyfriend  i had been taking the pills for one whole week its just that   i missed 2 pills 4 days before he came. my questions are: do taking the pills just before my perdiod altered    my pregnancy fertility? Can I get Pregnant even though i was supposed to be during my   infertile days? or did the pills make my infertile days fertil? how does that work?    I am so confused! (i've heard it is safe to have sex 8 days before and after your period).    When I started having sexual activity i was supposed to be during my "safe" days but i never got   my perdiod because the pills stopped it from coming.

20090205120803AAFifJ1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How can you tell the difference between pregnancy signs and pill signs?	i thought i may have been pregnant (though its unlikely), then i had a late normalish period and a negative pregnancy test at 8 weeks - what is the likelyhood of me being pregnant?      because im feeling quite bloated at the moment, and i'm on the pill which i started taking 2 weeks ago. Around this time is when i should of started my period, but obviously it hasnt come because im on the pill, but i keep feeling like im going to start any day now.      Are these effects of the pill? Does stress have anything to do with it? My stomach feels bloated but i don't know if it's because im so paranoid that im pregnant that i keep looking at it and thinking its big.      So basically, if you're on the pill and a couple of weeks after you start feeling bloated and feeling like you're going to come on, are these just pill signs?   How likely is it that you are pregnant if you have a period and a negative pregnancy test at 8 weeks?      im 17 and paranoid, very cautious and careful with what im doing - which is why it is very unlikely that i am, i just want to know so i can relax and enjoy my holiday without being stressed and upset.

My mom just called me(we're holding it in another state, so she's handling most of it) and said it was a no-go. She had called the library yesterday and they told her they had a "party/event room" to use for no charge. Today she got a call saying they don't hold birthday parties there and and any event held there had to be open to the public and educational in nature. Okay, it's a library, I understand but couldn't they have told her this YESTERDAY?      We've tried my uncle's church and we've also tried my brother and SIL's apartment club house. Now what? I don't want to spend an insane amount on a place and my parents' house isn't near big enough. We can't have it here because that would require people driving 3+ hours and that is our guest list.      Any other suggestions? I'm just afraid of a park because it will be the first part of April(the 4th) and I'm not sure how the weather will be then(it will be up in Iowa).

I can't help but notice, however, that there seem to be a plethora of ignorant people out there who don't know that unprotected sex can get you pregnant, or that the pull out method isn't actually a method or that precum contains sperm, etc etc.  I graduated in 2001, and I remember having sex education in 4th grade, 7th grade, 9th grade, and 11th grade.  Have they stopped teaching about sex in school?  If so, why?  This was all common knowledge when I was in school because it was taught!

How do you keep up with the demands of breast/pump feeding your babies until they are at least a year old?       If you decided to pump and feed through a bottle. What pump did you use? What bottles did you use?       Did you store your excess breast milk?    Did you consult a lactation consultant?   Did you take supplements to increase your milk production?    Did you take supplements to help with the nutritional balance of your milk?      I would really appreciate any help you can give me. Thanks.

She was starting to wake up many times in the night when she realized it wasn't in her mouth and she wouldn't be able to get back to sleep without  it. So, I took it away. She had a bad day or so, but seemed to be over it and has been sleeping much better without it. Tonight, however, she woke up screaming. I have tried rocking her, even feeding her and bringing her in my bed but that seems to make her even madder. She seems to be the type of kid who doesn't want me to soothe her....it makes me so sad that I can't make her feel better!! What should I do? She will eventually cry herself to sleep, but I just feel so bad making her do it! She has been crying for over an hour, despite my trying to console her.

When I was pregnant with my 1st I always saw other kids in the doctors office but I always thought to myself I wouldnt bring a kid there, and now im trying for number 2 and it has crossed my mind! lol my husband is one of those men who never misses my prenatal appts, He was their for EVERY SINGLE ONE with my daughter. and he will be like that for the second. And we dont really have anyone to watch out daughter, so he would either have to miss them and stay with her or we bring her along. I was just wondering what you guys did, if you brought your child along or not..      edit: also i am a SAHM so my daughter isnt in daycare or anything and we dont have much family around..

I feel like I have been bugging my Dr. with everything under the sun - so I thought I would get some opinions before I called his office again. Today, I am having what I think are contractions. My stomach is tightening and it is happening about every 10 minutes or so. I also have stabbing pains (feels like indigestion) in the upper part of my stomach. I have taken some TUMS - but I feel like it has only made the 'contractions' stronger. The baby is moving around - that is normal. The last time I went to the restroom, I also noticed my vagina being very sore. Am I just over thinking this - or could this be pre-term labor? I am at work - and wondering if I should go home....Thanks so much for the answers, I really appreciate it!

20090203030722AAPMMjw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	My5 year old son hums a lot, and repeatedly picks his nose and eats it.?	A few months ago he started repeately shrugging his shoulder.  This lasted for about one week. I removed milk from his diet and it stopped.  When he is hungry, he hums a lot.  He had a bunch of junk food one weekend---stuff with food dyes and sugar---and he started blinking his eyes more often than usual.  Ordinarily he doesn't eat junk food so it was easy to notice.  He also touches his face a lot, like rubbing under his lip.  He also chews on his clothes.  At night he twitches in his sleep. He definitely picks his nose a lot!!!!! and hums!  Has anyone had similar symptoms with your children???  It's sounding like Tourette to me, and I am devestated.
20090203043932AA0YO9a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breastfeeding - will it get easier?	I am breastfeeding my little boy who is currently 4 weeks old, and he is feeding on demand, putting on weight brilliantly and really seems to enjoy it!      My question is will I get into a better routine soon?  He feeds around midnight to 1am then will generally sleep until 4am then around 7-7.30am.  After that it is often anyones guess and sometimes he wants feeding hourly, especially in the evening.  He is definitely feeding, not just comfort sucking.      I don't want to stop breastfeeding, but I think I just need a bit of reassurance that a natural feeding routine is not far off!  I have a 4 year old daughter too, and my boyfriend works long hours and just to have some idea of how long till the next feed would be helpful for my sanity!
20090203032156AA9K02i	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why does being the new kid suck so much?	I just moved to a new school, I already knew 2 people and I'm hanging around them at lunch/recess.      The only problem is, is that all their friends ignore me and make me feel really left out..      Is that going to change?      I have been in conversations and stuff but I just feel so left out and like such a 3rd wheel.         to top it off, its a school without a uniform...there arent many schools at all like that in australia.  I hate it!      how can become part of the group and start socializing more with the group?      i hate waking up for school now :(

20090203041407AAp1C8a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	My 7 year old son has ADHD and  is having a hard time getting his school work done what do I do?	My son is in 2nd grade and he has ADHD, for a few months he has been having a hard time getting his work done in class and is getting in trouble for not doing it.  He gets fun privileges taken away in class which isn't fun for him.  Plus I think there may be kids picking on him at school which isn't helping.  I talk to his teacher and we have addressed the picking on issue to hopefully that helps. Even she says she is a smart kid when you get him to do the work which he knows how to do.  He kinda just spaces out doin his own thing.  I have tried taking toys away games and privileges at home, they don't seem of much value to him like what ever, NEXT.  Homework is a hit or miss, either he is into doing it or it gets dragged on for hours mind you he has little to do, I have tried play before homework, eat before homework, homework right after school, I am at a loss.  I am against drugs.  He takes multi vitamins, fish oil gummies and supplements for kids with ADHD.  Please any suggestions would be helpful, I feel like I am drowning with no help in sight.

20090205144344AAUoJ0h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	First timer... am i paranoid?	Hello!      My son is 6 days old...      *I keep checking on him just to make sure he is breathing. I am afraid he is going to vomit and choke on it.. resulting in me jumping at every tiny sound i hear from him..= No sleep for me.      *I feel like i am neglecting him when i put him in his bassinet. he is always sleeping, even when i hold him. so i like to let him sleep on the couch next to me when I'm awake and make sure he doesn't roll off.      *Neither me or my husband are talkers. we talk to each other but feel odd talking to him. I talk to him but i don't think i do it as much as i should.. and i don't "baby talk" - it is so annoying.      *He has jaundice so i am worried about that. the nurse at the hospital said it was not bad. just keep him naked in indirect sunlight. but i don't have sunny windows and it is cold outside to bring him out.      *and my friend mentioned to watch out for thrush, which i have never heard of.      * I feel like im starving him. the nurse said to feed him at least 1oz every 3-4 hours. (he weighed in at 7.7oz when born at 38 1/2 weeks) every time i feed him he eats pretty much exactly 1 oz from his 2 oz bottle (formula) and when my husband feeds him he eats 1 1/2 to 2 oz. i asked him to show me what he does and he does what i do so i dont know why he eats less for me.      *He pees a lot which is good. and so far has pooped at least once a day.                  I went to the pediatrician the day after we brought him home (so he was 3 days old at that time) and he said he was fine. but he is a quack. he does not believe in rx or even diaper rash creams and said not to worry about the jaundice. ive been calling other people to get appointments but the bastards don't call me back. so that is why im asking all this on here instead of my pediatrician - son technically has one but he is nutty and NOT being seen by him! (appointment would be in 2 weeks so i feel a little ease right now that i can get one before then.)      i guess my question is this typical of a first timer? Am i paranoid? lol

20090205160410AAzvXGu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Need help from girls?	i asked a question a few days ago about why teen guys don't consider girls feelings, but i didn't tell the full story. my ex bf would hit me and call me bad names....i was raped! it was so bad i haven't talked about it. not to my friends or anyone else. i feel like everyone will laugh at me. i tried to get away but he was to strong......i wish i could have just got out of the room but he had already beat me so bad. the only ones that know are my family and a few friends. it so hard to live with this. i still cry about what happened. i feel like it was my fault that he did that. like i said i wish i could have got away. what do i do now?
20090205163524AAoyg9p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do you need to buy bottles even if you are breastfeeding?	I'm starting to feel like I don't know anything about taking care of a baby and getting a little nervous.      The plan is for me to breastfeed.  But I'm hearing that I need to buy bottles anyway (say if something goes wrong in the night when I can't contact the lactation nurse for a supplemental feeding?)  So is this true?  And if this is the case, should I have a breast pump on hand as well?      Do any of you that breastfeed also have your milk in a bottle incase hubby or another family member, etc. want to feed?      Also, will a baby eventually need bottles for water or whatnot when they are older?  If yes, what age does all of this happen?      Finally, if I need to buy bottles, is that Dr. Brown's a good idea?  (I found an incredible sale on them, so if they are worth it and I need them, I'll invest.)      Thank you for all the help!

20090205161056AAPDzg8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do you actually understand how they do an abortion?	I'm just wondering the percentage of women who actually know, or knew what was happening to them when they got an abortion. Did they know that the abortionist rips their baby apart to pull it out? Or did they know that it's brain sucked out, or skull crushed? Do they know this? I'm doing a presentation on abortion, I'm just wondering the percentage of women who know this and still go through with it. Personally, I wouldn't want to know, and so I figure that's probably what others would want as well.   Thank you!
20090205161134AAc7KCu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Can i adopt my fiance's son before we get married?	My fiance has a 3 year old child, we have been together for two years. She is pregnant now with our daughter, and is due in 2 months. The father of the 3 year old does not see him or pay child support, he honestly would be glad to sign his visitation rights over and give his consent. I love her son very much, I treat him as if he was my own. Would I be able to adopt him without us being married yet? isnt that second-parent adoption? can someone fill me in with some more information? thanks

20090205163715AA6BLkl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could it possible be a missed miscarriage?	I went to the ER when I was 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant,    I didn't know how far along I was but they told me. They said    the baby's heart wasn't beating yet but that it may be too early.       They did an ultrasound and an internal ultrasound.          Then I went back when I was 6 weeks pregnant and the heart    still wasn't beating. So the doctor made me take a blood test to make    sure my levels were going up and she said they we're fine.          Then starting about maybe 2 days ago, my symptoms started going away.    I don't feel as tired, my breasts aren't too sore anymore, I don't feel nausea anymore    nor do I have lower stomach pains. Everything is just gone. Some people are telling    me that everything is fine as long as I am not bleeding but then I discovered missed    miscarriage.       My ob/gyn is horrible. They won't see me and I have to leave a message to the nurse    waiting for them to call me back, which they haven't before when I was concerned.       I don't know what to do. Should I go back to the ER for the third time or what?    I am 7 weeks and 5 days pregnant now. I will be 8 weeks on saturday.   My next appointment is in 4 weeks with the obgyn and I am not sure they will do an ultrasound then either.       I Pray and Hope everything will be fine.
