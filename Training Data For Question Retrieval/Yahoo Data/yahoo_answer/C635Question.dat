But she also tells me she's done with him and she wants something new.

20090219165729AAqPWUQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, I need you help BADLY?	Im 16 and a guy. I met a girl about a year ago. I had a few classes with her and slowly I got acquainted with her. Little did I know I was slowly falling in love with her. Now I am here, a year later, good friends with her, and deeply in love.    I just adore everything about her, there's nothing that I'd change about her. If i was more self confident and sure of myself I probably would of told her already, but I can't see me telling her how I feel and her saying no. I care about her so much that I can't risk the chance of losing the friendship.    She isn't a normal girl by any means. Like girls who will be all over you and let you kow exactly how they feel. She tends to keep to herself more foten and isn't open about it at all. I know it sounds terrible, and I way think of myself as stalkerish or weird if it wasn't my story, but I care about the girl so so much. I know she's single but I jst can't get up the courage to tell her. Honestly how my day goes with her influences everything.    I make it obvious and tell her when she loks beautiful and compliment her, but she can't seem to get the hint. I can't worry myself over this anymore.   See i need your help, advice? How can i go to show her how I feel? And could you see a guy for his personality?      Anything will help.   Thanks

I always ask my friends about him (too the part where it annoys them) and I have to see doctors every now and then for health reasons, and tomorrow I have to go to the hospital (doctors said until monday) and usually I'm fine with it, but now I am freaking out because I don't think I can bear not seeing him for 4 days.       By the way, I do talk to him, and he likes me also.   We just aren't going out.

20090219173814AA1QdJW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do all high school boys just care about looks?	Jeez, I am a freshman in HS and I though by now boys might be a little more mature. But no. It seem like all boys talk about is girls and rating and degrading and discussing their looks and features. It disgusts me. And what happens to girls who aren't as pretty or who have flat chest. Will they never get a boyfriend in high school? Do boys stay this way through all of HS and beyond? How do I deal with this??

20090219170917AANqEht	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship  Advice?	hello i am 17 and i am going out with a girl who i found out is 15. she told me after 2 weeks that she was 15, i assumed she was 17 because you know how girls look older than they are these days. when she told me that she was 15 i had a thought about it and i thought that i might as well carry on with her as we are great together. but last night (going out 6 weeks) she started to ask about sex. i always thought that she would want to wait until she was 16 (16 in 10 months). she asked me if i would like to try it 1 night, i weren't sure what to say so i just said we'll see. what should i do part of me thinks get in there just shag her but the other part of me thinks its not right. anyone got any ideas?
20090219175330AAffoZi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend broke up with me to be friends?	My bf of almost 6 months broke up with me 2 weeks ago because I told him I was falling for him and he said although he has very strong feelings for me he doesn't know if he is in love. He doesn't have that head over heels feeling like he had for his first love (which was in high school, he is 25 now). I really think he had that feeling in the beginning but we moved into the comfort stage really fast and he hasn't had a relationship last more than a couple of months so he wasn't used to it. We spent 5-6 days a week together, talked about the future, he spent time with my kids and told me that it was the best relationship he has ever been in. So when we broke up he said it was because he thinks he should have the head over heels feeling by now and doesn't but he is confused about how he does feel about me. He wants us to be friends and doesn't want to hurt me further down the road if we continue dating and risk losing me as a friend. He thinks we should hang out and see how he feels about me maybe he will realize that he wants to be with me. I told him I needed time before I could be just his friend. He called me 3 times the first week to see how I was, catch up, etc. He said he wanted to hang out when I was ready and again said he wanted to see how he feels and that he would love to say he is in love with me someday. I have to see him twice a week because my son takes a class where he works. The first time he acted normal and I felt a little akward. Then the second time he was acting a little weird kind of nervous. I called him a few days ago and asked if he could help with a project at my house we had been planning to do together that he offered to still help with days after we broke up and I said he didn't have to. When I asked him he was so excited about it and said he couldn't wait. Then I saw him yesterday and he was acting nervous again and didn't make eye contact with me when we were talking. I don't get it. If he really wants to be friends and isn't in love than why would he be acting weird and wouldn't he understand that hanging out so soon would be hard for me? Obviously it is too soon for us to really be friends but I want to show him I am ok (even though I am heartbroken) and see if there is a chance for us. What do you think? Is he going to come around soon or is he just doing the friends thing to keep me around as a future possibility?

20090219180657AAheZHv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does the fact that my boyfriend doest have a job, make him a loser?	Does the fact that my boyfriend doest have a job, make him a loser? I’m 20 years old, have my own car, go to school, and work part time. My boyfriend is currently going to school taking 15 units. My problem here is that he doesn’t have a job and I end up paying 70% of the time and him only 30%. Might I add he does not have a car. I love him very much; we connect on a deep level. I happy that I have him in my life, I just feel taken for granted sometimes. It doesn’t help when my mother mocks me saying things like, “you boyfriend lucked out..got him a suga mama”. Sometimes I feel like HE IS THE GUY, I want to be catered to lol. I just don’t know if I’m dating a loser. He is going to school, rite? Says thank you when I give him rides, and loves me. So now that you know the history, does the fact that my boyfriend doest have a job, make him a loser?      thanks,    Brook

Also he lied to me about how he had sex with this other girl...he wasnt honest about what he had done with girls. He told me he had sex but he said only with two. and he changed one of their names. but last night he confessed to me. I would drive him crazy everyday asking him about his past because i wouldnt believe him. I would not believe him cuz he didnt sound sincere. And now i found out he lied.

20090219171748AAvNGHe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a problem worth worrying about? Need Help!?	my boyfriend spends a lot of time playing xbox live. i understand he has a lot of fun on line but the problem lies in the fact that he and this girl he is playing on-line are both having a blast. They have so much fun together it is making me feel awful. We spend time together before he plays but then after that he gets on line and plays with her and even at times because he has soo much fun- laughing, playing, making jokes etc that they stay until past three am. I told him how I felt and he is very loyal, trustworthy, has never cheated and told me there is nothing going on between them over and over, but I feel uncomfortable that he is having more fun with some on line chick then with me. We are practically married because we live together - we are not engaged or married yet but we have been together for a while, about three and a half years going on four. Anyways, how can I cope with this so that I don't drive myself crazy with anxiety and insecurity and let this go. And how can I be more fun then his damn game and be more fun then the girl?!! any ideas or suggestions, tips etc?? Guys advice also needed!

20090219172525AAf62U7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is the guy I like treating me this way?	We've been talking since last July. We can't see each other in real life because he lives so far away from me, so we talked over MSN. He would always be so nice to me. He practically changed who I was as a person, and I'm very grateful to him for it. We used to talk until 4 AM every night during the summer.. then school came. We still talked a lot, and we'd occasionally talk until 12 AM on the weekends. We got along so well. We could make each other laugh endlessly.      We confessed our feelings towards each other to each other in January. Everything was blissful for a time. :]      Then something happened between us. It was because something I said got out, and our relationship was shattered.      Almost.      He's forgiven me, and I've learned from my experience. That was 2 months ago when that happened.      A month and a half went by of us slowly building our relationship up again. It was going VERY VERY well.      But for some reason.. now he's being very cold towards me. I know it's not another girl, because he told me that he still likes me. Sorry for my language, but he's being a complete DOUCHE towards me. And only me.       And this has only started happening recently. He's been insulting my intelligence after I sent him a part of my college essay, and he's been insulting me in other ways. Such as saying that I was as stupid as a fly, and that the only person I'm smarter than is Forrest Gump. (The reason why he said that is because I have a new shirt that says, "Run Forest, Run!" with two trees running away from smoke on it.) We have talked about our relationship (This was about a week ago) and we've decided that if I end up liking someone here, or he ends up liking someone where he lives, we would go for them instead of keeping up our "relationship".      He's really making me feel hated with his actions, though. I don't know what to do. My friends are telling me to stop any contact with him because he suddenly doesn't care about me anymore. But he still initiates conversations with me.. but they go nowhere.      Why do you guys think he's suddenly treating me like crap? I haven't done anything wrong. I haven't said anything "secret" to anyone.      Sorry for the huge amount of information, but I don't want anyone misinterpreting my "question".

20090219175042AAJBqbv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I know that my ex might have feelings for me?	I have MAJOR MAJOR FEELINGS for my ex and we went to a ball together last weekend and I felt as feelings were resurfacing. My cousin even said that it looked like he still liked me b/c the way he looked @ me. But what I just found out was that he has a girlfriend and I told him that I knew about her and he was cool with it but all this week he's been texting me and acting really BRAND NEW like he actually cares about me and the things I go through. everyday he asks me how my day went and he tells me that he cares about what goes on in my life.......we talk about different situations like how he acts towards me and he says he will change but I don't want to be the other chick and I feel that he should make up his mind about what he wants. and I don't want to be caught up in any drama that might go on with him and his new girl. B/c he tells me "oh you're so cute" and asks me when we're going to have sex and I don't want to do that. So can anyone tell me if my ex still wants me or if he just wants sex or wants to be friends.

20090219195036AAgtlTA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do girls get so jealous when they see a guy with another girl? Why does it make that much of a diff?	Like, I know a lot of girls who've actually started liking somebody JUST BECAUSE that guy flirted with another girl rite in front of them, more than they talked to her....      how does this exactly work out? and why??      and why do girls who are dating you act so nosy and wonder if you're cheating, blah blah blah? i mean its cute that theyre worried.. but WHY?      lastly, once again- whats with all the jealousy and competition? shouldn't how much you like a guy be dependent on his personality, looks, and compatibility... more than whether another chick digs him or not?       haha just wondering, bring forth ur answers lol

20090219202351AAX08a1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	FrIeNdLaTiOnShIp QUESTION (10 points)?	We are not in a relationship but we almost act like it (I stay at his house often...he cooks for me...we spend days on end together...with an incredible low amount of sexual activity)   I dont feel like he's using me for anything, I just feel like he does certain things because he feels he owes me...which is just as bad...I dont want him to be like "alright I paid you back, see ya"   The amount of time he invests with me in chillin and productivity makes me feel like he's my friend for real (and thats all I'm asking for)...circumstances make me wonder though.    How do I tell the difference???
20090219203623AAJpHPB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS! What do you consider bold?	Just curious.....I try to ask my mom this stuff but she has convinced herself I am too young to think about how guys think and dating (I'm almost 18). I'm just curious what you guys consider the line is between an outgoing,confident girl and a BOLD one. I'm old fashioned in the way I think that girls should wait for the guy to call her first, and he should also be the one to ask HER out, not the other way around. It just seems like in my 17 years of observing people around me and their relationships its not old fashioned, it just works out better for both parties. I dont want to be bold, but I also dont want to be a wallflower who sits around keeping her fingers crossed. Here's a list of stuff I debate over whether was confident or too bold. What do you think?   -Sent a facebook friend request to a guy I used to like but haven't seen/talked to in 4 years.   -text my best guy friends first if u want to. Also not afraid to write on the guys I'm friends with facebook walls   -asked a guy I like for his number,but acted like iwas getting everyone's number so he wouldn't know. I never called him.....but he did eventually sneak my number from a friend and called me   -left a comment on a guy friend who lives on the other side of the country's youtube video. It struck up a convo.
20090219200321AAlsdMj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get to know guys when I'm shy?	Here's the deal, I'm a shy person, I'm almost 16, never been kissed, never had a boyfriend, nothing. Now, this doesn't bother me, but lately, I've been a bit annoyed by it.       I am by nature, a shy person. I'm a deal where once you get to know me, you'll see the real me, I'm more outgoing and what not.      Due to my shyness I have a hard time meeting people and getting to know them. Including guys.      Any tips on how I can get to know guys better even though I am shy?
20090219191457AAKAkTQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Insecure about my bf :(  please helppp?I need answers.?	I'm dating this guy, dakota, and we were friends for awhile before we started going out. We started going out about a month ago, and since then things have been going great, but I get upset with him so easily. I think its because before we were dating he was a HUGE flirt and he already told me he flirts with girls subconciously and that the only reason he told me that is because he wants me to trust him. I have a hard time trusting people and I get very insecure, I try to stop it but its not easy. Usually he calls or texts me every night, and never skips, but somebody found out that we are dating that we didn't really want that person to know. That was today, and its 9:03 pm and he stilll hasn't called. This is where the insecurity kicks in. I feel like he's mad at me. I KNOW I'm over reacting, you don't have to tell me. How can I overcome this insecurity and stop over-reacting and sweating the small stuff?
20090219225208AAt5lm9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My friend is using the guy i like? (will choose best answer)?	BACKGROUND INFO: the guy i liked (i don't really like him anymore) he asked my friend out a few days ago because he liked her and felt bad for her cause her bf dumped her on valentines day and he was acting all sympathetic. my other friend and i just think he asked her out because he thinks shes easy and he was looking for a gf. what he doesnt know is that the reason he dumped her was because she was cheating on him.       now that theyre going out, she tells me she doesnt like him and is only dating him for free food (his parents own a restaurant) and shes dumping him after her birthday so he gets her a present.      i know that she wont listen to me when i tell her it's wrong. should i tell his really good friend who i am also really good friends with what her plan is? (if i tell him its too close to the source and theres a better chance she'll find out its me) i'm worried it will get back to her that i was the one who told her she was using him. and shes the type of girl who is really unforgiving and uses blackmail.      sorry it's long!      we are freshmen, hes a sophomore

He became one of my best friends in October and we recently started dating, but it only lasted three weeks. He told me I was a good kisser then two days later broke it off with me.

20090219211359AA83VSL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do in this situation?	ok so thers a girl ive been keeping an eye on recently. I dont know her much, but last year i met her but not really interested. i think she had interest in me. but i doubt it. anyway now, i got interest in her. but this is the situation:   she hangs out with people im kind of uncomfortable with (i havent talked to them in a long time, some i havent even talked to at all)    she is in cross country, i used to be in cross country, possible start of a conversation   shes kind of, um, peverted haha   anyway what should i do? whenever i talk to girls i have a feeling that they think im weird but theyre being nice (im very shy, dont talk much and they probably think im weird)

20090219230049AApXE8o	Family & Relationships;Friends	Can we still be friends after all of this?	My ex and I were together for about 6 months on and off. He didnt want to be tied down in a relationship so he broke up with me. He insisted that we remain friends because he didnt want to lose me and we hung out a few times since the break up. He would make plans for us to have dinner but then never called and went to go party. I finally had enough and whenever he called or texted after that, I didnt reply. A month later, I saw him and he asked why I was ignoring him and I said I have been really busy. This was the last time I talked to him over a month ago. I think I am pretty much over him (I have been kissing this other guy haha) but I have really missed talking to him, as a friend and now I feel that ignoring him was a mistake and that he is still immature but maybe I should be patient with him. He was my first so I dont want him to simply disappear out of my life. I know his schedule and I want to "accidently" bump into him and see if he will talk to me and if he still wants to be friends. Is this a good idea?

20090219225233AAcNkSr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Cant tell what signals hes giving; who can help me with my guy trouble?	so i met this guy a few weeks ago and hes really nice and hes not my usual type. but lately idk if i should take it as just being firendly or as flirting. the one day he was throwing candy down my shirt and just like smiling and laughing. then since i was sitting on the inside of the booth he offed to throw out my garbage. then today it was kinda aquward cuz everyone was out of school besides me and him.. so we were sitting across from each other and we were talking and stuff. he teases me a lot and makes me laugh, then i needed to make a copy on the copy machine and he paid for it. he also has a habit of saying goodbye to me when we walk to our different classes. usually its something like "good luck" or "see you _____" or "have fun." and my other friend, just kinda leaves and doesnt say anything like that. so idk .. i think it may be too early to tell but i wanna have some kinda feel on the situation before i decide to do anything.       so what do you guys think, does he like me? too soon to tell?            btw:: i dont wanna ask him yet. im just trying to get a feel on the situation.      p.s. he said that its the least he could do for me cuz i didnt know that there was a copier and he did. i was also pressed for time .. so thats why he said that. and he also does that thing, where he looks at me till i look and then he looks away.

I like him so much and i know he wouldnt pressure me to have sex with him, all i would have to do is say no. but....idk....do you think he is using me?   and what do you think i should do?

20090219202639AAsXC64	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm dating someone but I'm attracted to someone else, too. What to do what to do :(?	I'm kind of with someone right now.   He says I love you a lot, and I say it back. But sometimes I'm not sure if I really should be. But other times I'm absolutely sure, it seems.   I don't know what's up with that.   One day he was making food, and I had to leave. And I said, "I'm sorry I can't eat your food."   And he said, "It's ok, I've got another 60 years to make some for you."   And he says we're going to adopt a cat and get an apartment.   I've been with him for about a year.   He broke up with this last girlfriend of about 2 years only because she cheated on him.      It all sounds fine and dandy. And he's really nice and everything...   But I'm attracted to someone else too. He was my chem lab TA, and he's in the same chemistry frat as me, and I just see him around a lot.   I've been staying away from him for the most part because I'm attracted to him and I don't want to do anything regrettable, you know?   I don't want to lose this guy entirely because I'd still like to know him and be friends with him, but I just don't know how that'd be without me being attracted to him, still.         I just don't know what to do.      I don't want to break the first guy's heart. I want to make sure he's what I want. But I don't want to leave him.   I also want to explore other options like the 2nd guy.    I don't want to leave the first guy, piss him off, only to find out the second guy was never worth it.      I feel so selfish and almost like I'm cheating just because I'm attracted to the second guy,         Has anyone been through anything like this?   What to do :(?   It's really bothering me.

She pretty nice sweet and I can talk to her easily. we've been friends for awhile now and im looking to make it something more.

20090219203939AArze62	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Trying to talk to this guys. HELP!!!?	Ok so I met this guy through a friend and he is a mellow guy.  He is not looking to rush into anything because he is in college, a band, writes music and tutors.  I like him and the last i heard he liked me.  We talk on Facebook but he is only on about once a week so as you can tell he is not a computer person because he does not have the time and this is all moving slow ... very slow so i know he is going to California in a couple weeks with this family and I wanted to send him something funny like a link to a funny video about California or something.  I want to know if anyone knows of any links.  I feel if I send this to him I can send it as a message and possible spark a longer conversation than leaving messages on each others wall.

20090219183250AADRqWX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy problems!! Hate them, but you luv them! Answer, plz!?	okay, so there's this guy who a lot of girls think is cute, but they're not in love with him cute. and they always paired us up, cause we just "go together". and we became friends out of a fight with my ex-friend and his now-friend. and we used to talk on e-mails, but now we don't do tht anymore. he tells some ppl that we're still friends, tho we have no contact. but in our only class together, i see him staring at him, and trying to hear in on the conversations i have with my friends. and his friends all surround me (thanx to the teacher) so he uses tht excuse to sit near me...      Does he like me?!   he's really sweet when apologizing in e-mails, and he ALWAYS stares!!!
20090219191632AAf61Ds	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I have sex with him?? Please Answer?	Sorry I already asked this but no one was answering..      I am 15 year old freshmen, and I really like this 18 year old senior at my school. He already has a girlfriend, but he has been known to sleep around and I am sure I could convince him to have sex with me if I really wanted to. The problem is what I really want is to be his girlfriend but he dosent think of me like that and like I said he already has a girlfriend. Also I am a virgin and have never done anything with a guy before. Would being friends with benifits be a bad idea?

20090219185843AAwrXDx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Which guy do I pick? ...or just play it out until the end!? OPINIONS PLEASE!?	Alright, so here's the deal. I've got two guys that I like a lot but each are very different situations.       Boy 1: He's really hot, the kind of guy that every girl notices (possibly because of our hot emo styled boy definency). He's got a hardcore style, listens to music non stop, can't seem to sit still, happy, fun, social, and is in a screamo band =]. We text a lot but can't seem to remember how to talk or wave in person. I'm almost sure he's interested in me. All I got to do is verbalize and I can be set...we're both just kind of shy but certainly interested.       Boy 2: He's equally as hot, just not as noticed usually. He's got a skater style and lifestyle, happy go lucky, fun, hilarious, way more outgoing than boy 1, and we relate/connect very well. We talk on AIM a lot, we're good friends, we wave and always say hi to each other in the halls, we are capable of verablization. I'm positive he likes me too, more positive than the other. The bad thing though is that my friend also has a crush on him too...and not so sure of what to do about that...      I think I'm just going to let it play out and then figure it out...right? lol. But, i don't know!, what would you do!?

In the rain, while in a hot tub, or on a trampoline, or on top of your car is sexy too. Basically anywhere in the rain is though =]      Not really a fantasy or a fetish, but trip hop is great sex music. Massive Attack, Portishead, Sneaker Pimps, Zero 7...      Occasional roughness and being submissive is always good too ;]      Your turn....what does everyone like?

I was a little unsure if she still liked me and she didn't want to hook up as much unless there was a commitment.  So I wasn't feeling it anymore and I totally stopped talking to her for two weeks.  She was really sweet and never did anything wrong and I feel terrible.  I wrote her a few emails explaining that I am going through a really hard time and apologizing.  I was a huge d ick but she's still really nice about it.  She didn't freak out or hunt me down like other girls i've been with.  Even when we met up and I told her without reason that I didn't like her she was fine and later emailed me saying she was happy to be a friend to me if I needed help (I'm going through some things).        Did I just screw up?  What should I do???  Why is she acgting so nice?  I'm not sure if there are many other girls like her or why I just lost interest.
20090219192629AAe8TUA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will our long relationship come to an end?	My bf and I hae been together well lets say almost 4years. We have a lot of history. A lot. Point is, he has been having issues with trusting me, because when we started to go out he had asked me if i ever shared a kiss with another guy. some b**** lied to him and said something that wasnt true at all, the only true part was that I did kiss a guy, for like 3 secs. Well my bf has cheated on me numbers of times in the past, and broken up, and worked things out. I believe and know he is just guilty and this is why he feels issues. For other reasons too he gets angry with me, then will say lets break up and blablabla. I know he loves me truly, because we talk about getting married, and think about our life together. Tonight there was an issue in my house when my parents had an important guest over, and well there was a minor issue and he slammed the door and was very rude. He told me that there's always some bull with me or my family, and well in the past they have given him a rough time. Lately we fight a lot but always happy when we share time together. I love him and I know he loves me despite our hard times. What do I do?

After class he usually waits on me to get out the door and we walk down to my next class together before he heads out for his dorm.    BUT, the other day I was at the coffee shop on campus and saw him with a different girl. He came up to me still and said hey, and stuck around for a few minutes before he left.    Today I was on facebook and imed him real quick, but he was really short. Short answers and then had to get off suddenly.    I honestly don't know how to read this guy. I normally am good with it, but I mean, somedays it seems like he wants to talk and others he really doesn't. I think I'm gonna back off and if he wants to talk then he will......

So I had been talking to this boy and it was obvious he liked me at the time. We went out on Valentines day and it was alot of fun. We held hands, cuddled,and kissed, the next day he was texting me telling me how much fun the night before was. The night after though he hooked up with some girl at a party and he may have been drunk. We talked about it a little but it was just really akward. Meanwhile his ex girlfriend comes back to school and they've been "talking". The ex is a total slut and l am not just trying to be mean, she really is. We have talked a little since, but he hasnt texted me in awhile. I am shy so I am not foward with guys at all. What do you think he is feeling?      He is cute and sweet and never has been known as a player.

I found out that the guy I was dating had already been involved with someone the entire time we were dating and is now engaged to her. We were together for 2 1/2 years. I told his fiancee everything about us and that I wasn't the only one he cheated with. She wanted to meet with me at first because I had proof of the relationship but then she called back saying that she had all the proof she needed. She apologized to me for everything I went through with him, we had a very rough relationship.He also lied and said she was his ex. Why would she do this? Is it because she believed everything I told her.
20090219202328AArmiTs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex cheated and gave me an std?	I found out that my ex not only cheated on me but had a girlfriend the entire time we were supposedly together. He gave me an std and I think he got it from the girl he cheated with, I know for a fact that she has had a few. I never told him, he is now engaged to the girl he had the whole time, I told her everything about us but I never told her that he burned me. I just told her that she should go get checked out. Should I be direct and tell her exactly what's up or just leave it alone?

Okay so basically ever sense ive met this guy, ive sorta had a little crush on him. but he was wayyyyy out of my league so i didnt even bother flirting.      well this school year he is all my classes, and then we stared talking and hanging out. now hes one of my really good freinds. ive always knew he kinda liked me but nothing big, he would always flirt with me and stuff ( but yet agian he does that with a lot of girls)      then one day he tells my best freind that he kinda likes me. and of course she tells me right after.       so the next day he text me saying "if i were to ask you out would you say yes?"   and me being the idiot i am, i blew it and said no.   well of course right after that he txt me agian saying that he likes me.      for the next couple days at school it was kinda ackward but, he broke up with his girl friend for me.    well we would flirt ALOT after that but nothing really happened.      and now he still kinda play flirts with me and gets kinda jealose when i say i think other gusy are hott.....but........ he got back together with his girlfriend and i dont think he likes me anymore.      little by little during that i fell deeper in love with him, and now i REALLLLLYYYY like him.    BUt i have NOOOO clue what to doo.   please give me some advise!         Something you should know:   Were 13.   (dont say were to young to date)   he likes to be the center of attention.   and he always freinds with his EX's   (hes really cute!)

20090219213559AAmHiOP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have boy troubles...please help me!?	So my boyfriend and i have been dating for about 4 months and we are not in love or anything, i mean i am only 17, what do i know about love (he feels the same way, calls it the "four letter word"). What i want to know is what do other couples go through. We have had a couple arguments the ended in me not talking to him for a day or two but most people think i am over reacting.      There is a history of Alcohol problems in my family and as a result i do not like any form of alcohol. our first big fight was me not wanting him to go drinking with his buddies ( he is 17 and shouldn't be doing it regardless) and he just didn't understand why I didn't want him to go, it wasn't until a mutual (female) best friend talked to him that he agreed not to go. He also has a habit of being a jerk to me and the best friend for no real reason ( as far as stupid comments and such go). He almost never gives me compliments directly and admits to looking at other girls boobs (including that female friend i mentioned).      another problem is that he sometimes gets frustrated with me because I don't want to loose my virginity until I know I am in love with the person ( again only 17). These things are ongoing discussions with us.      my question is: What do most couples put up with and just your general opinion of the situation.
20090219212037AA2FQ8n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My best friends boyfriend is a jerk?	My best friend in the whole wide world's boyfriend is a huge jerk. He's made racist comments about my nationality, and my bff's. He picks fights with me for no reason, and then acts like it's my fault when I start yelling at him. When me and my bff are playing around and acting silly, he calls me a retard, and says I'm stupid, and when I fumble over my own worlds since I'm upset he calls me pathetic. He says I'm hateful and my bff now is my only friend which isn't true, and he says I hate everyone and everyone hates me. And he says boys dont like me and i'll never have a boyfriend.  When my bff is there, he pretends he's sorry about it, but once she leaves he turns around and starts insulting me.  Today once she left he came to me and started calling me a dumbass whore, and he was saying I was stupid.       I've only known him for about 2 weeks and she's only been going out with him for one, even tho she's known him longer then I have. He's mean to her but not as much and he talks about how attractive other girls are, in front of her. He over exaggerates and says I'm rude to him and freak out over nothing and i have anger management problems when his gf/ my bff sees us arguing.      =\ I don't know what to do. My bff doesn't do much about it, she just sits and lets it happen. She always yells at me first when she forces us together and tells me to be nice when it's always her bf who starts it. I...I've run out of ideas. I've tried to ignore it, but the insults get worse, and she doesn't seem to realize that he's an (excuse my language) asshole. She's convinced that he loves her and he cares about her but she doesn't really seem to get that if he can treat his gf's bff this way then he can treat her like this too.      i dont know what to do.
20090219193537AAEBKzi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you guys think i like this guy too?	he's like my best friend in the whole wide world. originally i was just good friends with him but now it feels really different. im not popular at school and he always sticks up for me even though its his friends that make fun of me and today he yelled at my friends for calling me a fat *** today and telling me that "thats my new nickname because it fits". its really easy for me to get comfy around him and just put my mind at ease even when were not talking at all and he just makes me feel good about myself which says alot because im clinically depressed (not to be mistaken for emo... i AM NOT EMO). he always tells me im not fat or ugly or anything and will make shure i believe it too. he can also read my emotions and knows when to let me be pissy and knows when to tell me im being way too pissy.   do you think i like him and do you think he likes me??? i dont know so i need your help

20090219194148AA1okRs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Going out with old friends or new?	im 17 and tomorrow night i have have the choice between going out with two different sets of friends. I could either go to one of my best friends house where all of my best friends are gonna be and even this girl who ive had my eye on for a while. Problem is, its problably gonna be pretty boring and all were gonna be doing is is probably talking and watching movies.      OR.. i could go out with my friends who ive basically met this year. Their pretty cool and were gonna be drinking around town and stuff. I havent gone drinking in like 3 months, because of wreastling, so im dying for some beers. Ill also have a way better time cause well be drinking and f*cking around. Also my other set of friends do not drink and im basically the only one that drinks so if i go with them were not gonna be drinking.      I really cant choose because on one end i dont want my best friends whove ive had for so long to think that im abandoing them. Also ill be with this girl who i have a thing for, but ill be bored as hell. Also i probably wont be able to do much with that girl because of all the other people and itll just be akward when i start hitting on her. On the other hand i could be drinking with my new friends and having a good time and who knows, i might end up getting drunk and hooking up with a girl thats also gonna be there. So which would you guys choose?         PS.. i dont want to hear any talks about underage drinking. No matter what anyone here says, its not gonna stop me or anything and its just annoying
20090219195809AAX9vrV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question about this shy girl in my class?	I have been interested in this shy girl for quite some time now. In school, when she first found out that I liked her, she smiled, but recently she has not been smiling at me too much. However, in class, my teacher put her next to me. She was extremely red and only said very little when I tried to talk to her. In the halls, I can catch her eye looking at me, but she doesn't smile at me like when she first found out I liked her. Sometimes, she tries to avoid eye contact and turns all red once in a while. I too am shy, so I don't know if my shyness caused her to be even more shy. But my question is this: are these body language acts clues that she may like me back? Also, how can I talk to her when she is shy and I am shy? I have not really made contact with her for two weeks since the day she found out, but she still looks at me a lot, but no smiles. Is she just being overly shy?

20090219202028AARAnuK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need relationship advice please!?	I met this girl in August and have been talking to her ever since. She lives in upstate NY and I live in PA, it is about a 5 hour drive for either of us to see each other. We are both college students and support full-time jobs so our availability almost never matches. I have some really strong feelings for her and though she hasn't said it, I think she feels the same. We recently got to talking about how a relationship between us would work and she stated that we would'nt live near eachother for a few years possibly. Needless to say this bugged me a bit. I really want to make things work but I feel like a long distance relationship might be troublesome for us both. Any advice anyone could give in this situation would be appreciated greatly! Thanks everyone!

20090219235110AA2vqYD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why dont men listen to women?	My partner just bought a new computer, he was going to take my son and go pick it up from the shop, while i got some thing from the shop, i knew there wouldn't be enough room in the boot of the car for my shopping and his computer, i asked Him if he could just drop it at his place He said he would think about it. he said that would mean he would have to wait to put it together (as we don't live together), he said he would have to go home tomorrow afternoon, because he wanted to put it together as soon as possible. i said that was okay      i rang him this afternoon and asked if he had though about it further, he said no, so i gave him a couple of reasons he should leave it at his place they were: There may not be enough room in the boot.                           If he took it to my place he would want to put it together straight away and if i said wait until our son was in bed he would get angry at me.                           i then went further and explained why he should wait, because our son is only 2 and he would make him angry by wanting to investigate and "help".      My partner they got angry and accuse me of being so controlling "if it's not your way it's the highway, everything is your way and if it's not then look out" he said aggressively.      i then stated why it wasn't a great idea again and he hung up on me???      Sometimes i wonder why i am even with him, i love him but he makes me so mad, am i in the wrong??      Why is he like this??      Does it sound like it's all my way or no way??      please i don't want bias answers, i just want to know what i did wrong??

I have been forced into an arranged marriage when I was 16, I am not living with him anymore but he acts like he is loosing his mind every time I talk about a divorce. My mom just forces me into being in touch with him because she likes him like a son. I so not want him in my life, but would never be able to get rid of the guilt if something happens to him mentally or physically because of me. I am stuck and I am sick of this. I don't want to hurt anybody or their feeling neither I want to sacrifice my life for somebody I don't love. He and I are two different people who have so different worldview and he is a anti-social person unlike me who has a big circle of people to fall back on ( although trying to find answers on yahoo may suggest otherwise).       Please people I want to be free... from him and the fear of hurting him..... I am stuck!!! HELP!!

20090219232324AAaVWtM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Have you? Do you? Marriage, love, being happy, staying together and keeping strong?	This is a question I've asked myself time and time again. So I'm going to ask other people their opinions. Do you think two people can really stay married forever & still be happy. Almost every friend I've had their parents were divorced, fell out of love, were unhappy, turned out to be different people. Most people I meet have had one or more divorces. It seems as though, when two people get married after a while they stop caring. Not getting dressed up as often, no passion, no making love, no going out of your way to please, no teasing or joking. [Which I understand, life is stressful and it's all about time]. Most of the relationships/marriages I see after a while turn into yelling, fighting, no passion, less making love, less caring. It scares me. Then most people I meet that are still married, are only married still because they don't want the hassle of divorce, or it's for the children. I want to know if you can be with someone for a LONG time, as long as you live and be happy and in love. Most older people tell me, they had a ton of serious relationships, were married a few times or a long time before they finally met "the one". So let me know. If you have a story to tell, I'd love to hear it [:
20090220011528AAHokRs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy, Would You Date a Girl With..?	...saggy boobs?  My friend claims she has really saggy boobies, but I don't think she does (of course I haven't seen them without a bra, though).  She's 26 and said she is too nervous to get naked in front of guys.  We looked up the "pencil test" online.. it claims if you can put a pencil under your breast and it stays there, then you are in need of a breast lift.  She can hold 5 pencils..  What do you think?
20090220000349AA44gua	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I made some mistakes and want him back. Do I stand a chance?	I had been dating this guy for the past 2 and a half months and decided to end it. During that time we got pretty close. My reasoning for ending it is that I wasn't sure that it was the right time for us to be having any kind of dating relationship. He told me from the beginning that he is going through a divorce and is trying to uphold his business. Both of which were putting him under a lot of stress and that he's not ready to be emotionally involved. I became concerned when we were sleeping in the same bed together almost every night and nothing physical was happening and I never felt like he wanted to be affectionate. This was strange for me since I'm used guys being more aggressive. The other problem is that while I was contemplating ending things I went out with another guy for dinner, nothing happened but I figured it would be a way for me to see what else is out there before I decided anything. I never told him about this but did mention the next day that I wanted to keep things open to see other people. During our breakup conversation I slipped and told him about the other guy. He was livid!! He said he is upset that I didn't tell him before I went out with the other guy but after. Since then we have been fighting and he doesn't want to even talk about it! I apologized to him in an email and he txted back saying he accepted it but to not bring it up again. I am really regretting that I did this. Now that 2 weeks have passed since this I feel like if I had never gone out with that guy and had been more patient things could have worked. I just gave up trying to contact him the other day since we have just been going back and forth with this fighting. I want a second chance though. I told him I made a mistake but I don't know if he will forgive me. Im not going to sit around waiting but if I still would like to be with him. Do I stand a chance here? If so how should I go about this ?? Should I call him, drop by his house and talk in person??? He hasnt called or anything since last week. I really just feel like I screwed this up. I haven't had alot of luck with guys and it just feels like such a long waiting game for the right one.

20090219235110AA0uLnh	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need help badly.............?	I've been living with the same man for 12yrs, we are not married.  I'm 53 and he is 68.  All these years he said he plans on marrying me and nothing happens.  He does have an estate, but no will or living trust and always promised the house to me - okay where's the proof.   I feel like I'm being made a fool of and am very humiliated.  I turn over my check to him every month to pay bills, yet he doesn't give me any cash to have of my own.  I don't know what to do, I feel obligated to stay because he did do a lot for both my boys and myself, and I do owe him money.  I'm on social security disability and get a check once a month. Please share your thoughts, thank you.

20090220005129AAOqmCu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just wanna know if am over reacting with my Inlaws?	It was my first visit with my inlaws in Portugal dunno exactly what to do coz twas my first interaction with an inlaws ( never had one before).  We stayed in their house and my mother inlaw would always redo the bed everyday even how neatly i would do it.  She never knocked on the door  when she wants to say something.  My 1 year old son won't eat anything she would prepare because he was having cough and cold and it's normal for the taste bud to taste bland but she kept insisting because i trained him to eat rubbish. Dunno if potato mixed with chicken,  carrots mixed with wheat and red meat,  cereal with egg and anchovies in a ready mixed cup for babies is something you call rubbish.  She thought i didn't understand but she told my husband our 1 yr and a half son looked like a 5 month old baby boy, while others would say he looked like a 2 year old.  She completely disagree that i gave my children a bath before bedtime because she told me that was what made their resistance to sickness weak( don't really understand about that).  One day i was in the bathroom and i heard a comotion outside, it was my mother in law and my sister in law.  I didn't witness what happened but when i ask my husband about it my 10 year old daughter and 8 year old son readily answered Grandma hit Tita in the head with the cooking spoon and Tita hit back Grandma's head too!  I was so shocked . . . . I understand they are different but i never thought they are Animals.  Another thing is my sister in law shopping spree.  She is now living with a boyfriend  for like 8 months,  my husband used to send her money regularly that was before she cohabit with the boyfriend.  The first day we went shopping  she bought a new phone and my husband  paid for it.  The second day  we went to a shop and i waited for like 1 hr outside the fitting room coz she decided to try 18 types of clothes and ended choosing 7 or 8 of it,  and when i went to pay for my own shopping i was surprised when she told the cashier attendant that it was together with mine, but i never said a word and paid for it.  Then i proceed to buy a shoes for my daughter  and off she went to the adult section and choose 2 pumps and you can guess what happened.  I was too shy to say no!...  The following day was with another boutique i needed a pair of jeans but she once again started choosing a pair of blouse and a slacks and told me it matches her purse i discreetly checked the price of the stuff she liked and it cost 276 euro much more expensive than the two pair of jeans that am suppose to buy so i decided not to buy the jeans and her reaction was,  okay if your not going to take that maybe am not gonna take mine too. fine by me...... but after we got out of the shop she started showing her withdrawal from me.  After lunch we started walking and shop again  and she ask me if we could drop by a perfumery she just would like to check on something,  when we got there she choosed 2 kinds of perfume the she proceed to the cash register line but i never join her,  when it was her turn she called me and ask if i have extra 75 euro coz she only got 37 euro for everything,  it is then i showed a face i really got upset never seen this kind of thing before.  After the store we meet my husband and her boyfriend which went to another store and she started crying but won't tell my husband why she was crying.  And the next day everyone pretended nothing happened, my husband and I had  talked about it already the day after but his only reaction was like I didn't really know my sister act like that i was away while she was growing just let me pay you on how much you spend for her i just can't offened her by telling her what she was done was kind of opportunisitc.  Just can't hurt her,........The whole two weeks of vacation was over, everyday she was with us coz that's how it used to be each time my husband would visit Portugal.  My dilemma was my husband wanted to go back there this coming july and let the children spend more time with the Grandparents. . My eldest and my husband are the only one excited with the idea,  my oldest became the new grandfathers pet on that vacation.  I really don't want to go back there but i also don't want to spoil their excitement.

My neighbor was out. He came up to me and asked me where I lived. I told him sense he pretty much knew now.       Then today around 9PM I took my dog out. I was walking down one of the roads and he had followed me down the road with his car and pulled up. His son was in the car with him. And he was like "I just wanted to say hey." And he revved his engine and drove away.      This guy is starting to give me the creeps. I'm 15 and he looks like he is in his 30's what should I do about him?

20090220000706AAKyTMJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is a married man who continnually talks to his Mama 2-3 am in the morning a mamas boy or what?	My Husband does this and has been doing this for years now and it annoys the **** out of me, not to mention that I think it is a bit strange.  He's 30 some years old and He says his Mom ( who lives in California, while we live in in Florida ) calles him at these times because of her minutes.  Excuse me but who on a minute phone doesn't get free minutes after like 7 or 9 pm.  ridiculous. I really feel this is disrespectful of her toward me because it disrupts my sleep.  My husband will lay in our bed talking loud on the phone with her and will tell me that that's his mother and I am wrong for feeling that way I do and that I just wish that my mom ( who lives in Germany & would never, even with the time difference continually call me at those hours) would call me in the middle of the night.  He has even told ME to go into another room when he does this.   I am so infuriated and fed up about this and I just want to know if other people think my feelings are valid or am I just trippin out like my husband says. I who am dogtired am up at almost 3 in the morning right now because of this.  Please let me know intelligently bacause HE says he will not change this.
20090220001016AAwqmYf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Confused, scared and an emotional mess. My Husband has been cheating and we have been separated.?	Long story short as I posted before. He left me during my cancer treatments. During treatments he started to take things out of our home, new bank account, PO Box and started a band.    I found out he has an ad posted on an online dating site. The three girls posted as his "friends" live in the area and because I am computer savvy I found 2 of their names and addresses.    I confronted him about one girl as I pretended someone told me. He said they were just friends, boy was he shocked.    I am scared about divorce because i need my health care benefits through his job. What happens if the cancer comes back?   Has anyone divorced in New Jersey and can adultery help my case?   He has me right where he wants. He is emotionally abusing me during this difficult time. I have 2 boys and have been married for 20 years.

It all began when i finished work, my handphone ran out of battery and when i reached home, i made sure i call him the 1st thing.Whn i called, he got so furious asking me "who did you go out with and who did you FU**, which men is it?" many times i had warned him not to link me with another men, but he doesnt get the message.I have never done anything behind him but he seems to doubt me.Once i cut and hurt myself, he'd come back to me and say he was sorry and ask me to forgive him.2 years i've been in this r/ship, just imagine how much of cuts and cruises i had to prove to take to show him tht i loved him.Now we're okay but i dont know when the next blast wud occur.Opinion pls.

Then later that same day he called up the girl to ask her out for me, but I thought he was kidding so i didn't stop him, and he really did it, and she said "not right now"... and it pissed me off, not b/c she said no, but I wanted to ask her myself and he asked for me. I am so f**king angry with him, but he is still my best freind, what should I do....b/c now I don't know weather or not the answer would have changed if i asked myself....what should I do????

20070417073732AAM04FD	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Etiez-vous de grand(e) timides quand vous étiez plus jeune ?	Quand on repense à ses tous premiers émois, on a parfois envie de se taper la tête contre les murs : "bon sang, ce que j'ai pu être bête !"      Inexpérience, timidité, scupules... Les motifs de se moquer de sa propre attitude sont légion. Personnellement, j'ai laissé passer un certain nombre d'occasions avec des filles à l'époque.       Maintenant ? J'ai gagné en lucidité et en assurance mais je suis casé (la vie est parfois mal faite, que voulez-vous, c'est ainsi).       Et vous ?
20070705022712AAf3ik7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls do you get nervous?	Good looking social and outwardly confident girls, do you get nervous and shy even if the guy you like is very friendly and  seems approachable. If you give hints that you are interested do you sometimes just re-coil and go quiet when he comes over to talk to you or just disappear quickly without saying anything?

20070514172834AArUUm2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like him,what should I do?	Ok to sum things up. I really like my friend Matt,I mean alot! He always stares at me & winks. Everytime I see him he waves & lifts his eyebrows. I see him walking to his bus & I call him name & he comes & wlaks next to me & just smiles & stares. He seams really shy around me because he asks me if I have a b/f but when I say no he smiles & turns red. I mean I'm shy too. The problem is he said he wants to get to know me more becuase I asked him out but he doesn't even make an effort to. Everytime I try tot talk to him he says like 2 words then goes back & talk to his friends.  He's a Senior & I'm a Freshman. I don't know if I should even bother with him cause of that. What should I do? One other problem I see guys looking at me alot & smiling. Does that mean they like me? I'm '5"8 so maybe their afraid of me cause of that? Should I try to be more open because I have trouble getting b/f's? I don't want to seam too forward or anything. Thanxs everyone for your help!

EVERYONE LOVES HIM....my parents, my friends, my relatives....He is wonderful, caring, trustworthy, hot, great job, gorgeous house, genuine, would be a great father.....I have always been in drama filled relationships and FINALLY decided to get out of it after 7 years and this has been my 1st non drama relationship      I took a 6 month break and then met him. We clicked. We both wanted to get married to each other someday, have kids together, and live in our "now" house FOREVER.      One day my feelings clicked off. Honestly, I woke up one morning after we were dating for 3 months and had come to the conlusion that I didnt love him anymore. Since then I went on some anti-anxiety meds and my feelings have been up and down. When we are out of town I dont think about anything and have a good time with him, BUT when we are at home I get all anxious and feel like I dont love him anymore...I dont know why but the smallest things he does annoy me and the next day everything could be fine. I just dont feel as romantic as I used to with him. I still enjoy having sex with him and spending time with him but feel as though something is missing or I dont love him anymore? I dont trust myself with this relationship. Please help, I hate hearing that I am not in love with him anymore...For some reason people re-assuring my love for him makes me feel better?!?!?

I am on a limited budget so this is really difficult.  I would like to hear from some guys--what would y'all like? Girls too--past experience?       Any suggestions?

I do not take things serious. I love to cuddle to. Be appreciated for me in who I am.

Pero no entiendo porque ella me empieza a gustar. No se lo puedo decir porque eso terminaría nuestra amistad, creo que debo alejarme de ella, pero eso la lastimaría, creo, pues ella disfruta estando conmigo y se que me quiere mucho y yo a ella. Es decir: no se lo puedo decir porque no habria mas amistad, y no me puedo alejar de ella porque ella saldría herida. ?que puedo hacer? ?Antepongo mis sentimientos a los suyos?

20070510182916AA2sXAU	Family & Relationships;Friends	0MFG. iS THiS FAiR?	She doesn’t wanna stick around   Why should you help her when she is put on rebound?   I know she’s your best friend   And I realize you said you’d be there until the end   But if she doesn’t put forth effort to stick around   Then you don’t need to be there waiting on the rebound.   You have seen her through her hardest times and always knew what to do.   But when she was all better and fresh she leaves you for the other best friend she always knew.   But if she doesn’t wanna stick around.   Why should you be waiting to help her on the rebound?   One day her heart will get broken   And you’ll be the one there with tissues that are soon soakin.   Then when she is all better and fresh she will leave you for the rest.   She’s your best friend but she’s defiantly not better than the best.   She knows now she’s not going to stick around.   But she’ll come to you because you’re the only one that will be waiting on the rebound.   One day you soon grow apart from your old friend.   And realize best friends really do end.   One day you didn’t stick around   And she thought she’d see you on the rebound   Now she is mad.   But that is just too bad   Friends are there for each other   Not just one over another.   So this friendship is coming to end   And I guess you never really wanted to be my friend   Unless I stuck around    When you were put on the rebound   Sorry to tell you friend   But I can’t stay and help a friendship that is coming to an end   Because you have left me for another   And I don’t need to be treated like your mother.   Remember I stuck out our promise and kept our friendship strong   To bad you didn’t want it to last to long   Now that no one bothers to stick around.   I guess no one will wait for you on the rebound   Goodbye fellow friend   I am glad we are finally towards the end.

20070513234800AAhaCRd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have been dating a nice guy for the past 1.5 months and we've hang out literally every day over this time.	I am a conservative girl and think sex should be like after 6 months in any relationship. We had sex this weekend (attraction and closeness from spending alot of time together) and I feel it was too soon and rushed. He doesn't have any problems with it and says he wants a committed relationship. Im just worried something will change or he'll think differently of me and the chase and thrill will be over even before it really started. I've told him, we shouldn't do it again until Im ready. Can I do this or will it make him feel rejected or inadequate for me? Im a worrier and can get too analytical of situations..

I can make her laugh. Thats a plus there. We are friends, but we only meet like a month ago, and havn't hung out too much. We went to a club, she danced with me all night, and she was good. She got a bit close too, lol. We chilled a few times, but I wanna know how I can impress her, or get tips for her to fall for me. Something I can do?

With that, he gave one blink and said, "Leave... Now."   I felt my stomach drop down to my uterus.    I couldn't believe my ears. Though I should of expected for him to say such things.   I felt foolish and unloved. My mom was so totally right. Why did I come here in the first place? I knew he would do me no good!   .

I think she thinks i'm cute, because she looks at me and when we walk past each other, I went over to talk to a co-worker friend who is a girl and she went over there too. She was doing something next to us. I'm thinking she was just pretending to do something so, she can listen to what we were saying. she came by the the aisle I was working on and she was just standing there, just looking around at the items. The 1st time, I didn't talk to her, I talk to her a little bit. I asked her, if she is going to start working here and she said yes, and I asked her if she was from this city. she said yes to that too. Than, I asked her if she had a boyfriend lol. She said she does and than she left. Okay this is what I got so far about her. She was standing there expecting me to talk to her, which I did, but what I don't get is why was she expecting me to talk to her, if she has a boyfriend already??? She seems polite.

20070620144605AA27SlX	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do if you and your best friend hate each other?	My best friend and I hate each other, more like I hate her. We have been best friends since Sept. when we met each other. our friendship is very complicated. Everything was fine until she met this other girl and they started to get along better than me and her and she was always with the other friend. They were always together and when I was there, they ignored me. And the worst thing is, I think I want to be friends with the other girl rather than my best friend now because she is actually nice to my best friend. My best friend expects me do whatever she wants and to do stuff for her but when I need her to help me, she doesn't help. I'm shy and she's always telling me to make more friends and when I do she gets all mad because I'm not spending time with her anymore. The worst thing is, I don't want to leave her because she has a lot of cool ideas and things for us to do all the time and being with her when she's nice is better than being with my other friends. What should I do?

In the first six months of our relationship he lied almost about everything even things that didn't matter. I am recently finding out about these lies. He doesn't lie to me anymore and he admits that is was wrong then. My question is is he just f**king with my mind? I've always know a liar as always a liar and a cheater as always a cheater. My guts tell me he being honest. But, I just do not want to be naive. I have a lot going for me in life. I love him more than anything and I definately don't want to give him up ... if there is a chance that he is honest and that the past was just the past. Please   HELP!!!!! and Thanks    :)

20070727100222AALROCP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you have feel weird about "commiting"?	I found out this guy liked me, & then I realized that I liked him. We ended up holding hands yesterday when we were hanging out. And then later that night on the internet he goes "So are we going out?" & I had no idea what to say, so I said sure. But now I kind of feel like...maybe I should've thought about it more. Because we're 15 & I KNOW we're going to break up eventually (obviously), so isn't it easier just to ... not go out? Idk I just feel like it's kind of stupid to be dating now since you know it's going to be over at some point. And earlier we were talking about the difference between like bf/gf and friends with benefits. Idk, i doubt this question makes any sense. But if you could try helping,that'd be great?

I have a girlfriend who I've been seeing for 2 month.      Last week, she stroke the top of my leg on the bus unexpectedly while I was looking out of the window glancing at the horses in the field.  I was shocked and within 6 to 10 seconds I had came in my trousers.  I didn't tell her!      Yesterday I wave goodbye to her from my front door.  As soon as her taxi left my steet, I ran upstairs to masturbate but I accidentally 'came' half way up the stairs.  I even had to change my Tuesday underpants.      Today she telephoned me to ask if I wanted to go to her house to help her move her furniture around in her bedroom.  Within 10 seconds I had accidentally 'came' again.  Naturally she doesn't know about this and I had to change into my Thursday underpants.      Tommorow is Thursday!  What the hell do I wear????

20080927214338AAb6GUr	Family & Relationships;Friends	Wanna be a cheerleader?	hey, i am in 11th grade and i wanna try out for next year as a cheeleader.  However, I am really shy and amazingly quiet in class. Around my friends i am super loud and i know i have potential to be more comfortable and popular, but there is a problem.  All of the popular kids know me as the kinda quiet nerd, and i know a ton of people who are in cheerleading but they think i am weird too.        I want to gain more confidence and change their opinion of me so i can become a cheerleader.  And i seriously don't want to become one to become popular, but i love how active it is, how it has school spirit, and especially how i can preform it in front of the school for games and rallys.        I really wish i could become one, but i think it would be awkward with the popular kids since i am a quiet nerd and they are loud and popular.        So my question is, how can i become at least well-known as a nice confident and sociable person, so that they will accept me?

It was just soooooo awkward for me.       Everyone else just went in for the hug, and I held back, becasue it was so awkward for me. Does anyone else ever feel like this?

Hace como 3 dias una de mis primas me hizo exactamente eso, vino por atras cuando era de noche y yo estaba tratando de abrir la puerta de mi casa... escuché un ruido atras mio y me di vuelta a ver, pero como habia estado mirando hacia la luz de adentro de la casa cuandome di vuelta no veía nada en la oscuridad... ella piensa que SI la vi, pero no... y cuando me asustó lo primero que hice fue gritarle que era una estúpida y que no me lo volviera a hacer (repetidas veces, como 3)... y parece que se ofendió mucho... obvio que despues de eso me metí a mi cuarto a llorar un rato poque no me puedo contener cuando me hacen eso...      Hoy hice el intento de disculparme con ella por haberle gritado pero no me quiere escuchar, me dice que no tiene nada que hablar conmigo, esta super enojada, no tolera que le griten...      somos (eramos) muy buenas amigas, pasamos (o pasabamos) mucho tiempo juntas, me quiero reconciliar con ella... pero si hago el intento de explicarle mi "trauma de la infancia" no me va a creer... que puedo hacer???            besotes y gracias de antemano ?_?

20080322072127AAFr1pK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I didn't cheat, but I feel like a ***** anyway--HELP?	Last night my ex-boyfriend "George" invited my friend and I to stop by a party at his house, which is down the street from mine. George was my first love, and we still have feelings for eachother.      At the time, I thought it would be a good idea to call my current boyfriend "Tom" and tell him, since he knows I have a history with George. I told Tom we were going to George's house and asked him if he was comfortable with it. There was a long pause and then he said, "I guess...as long as you don't do anything"(??) He's such a laid-back guy, but he sounded kind of pissed.      I don't think I should have called Tom, since I made it seem like a much bigger deal than it was. But now I'm worried that he's annoyed with me. Did I do the right thing?       We had planned to hang out on Monday after Easter. Should I call/text him before then, and if so, what should I say?      PS--I love Tom and would never cheat on him.

20081113015930AA5zRO2	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it cruel if you want your mother to leave your one bedroom apartment for her four bedroom house?	I give her this she has paid all of my bills for the last 2 years (well not all but most).  I am more then grateful.  It was an agreement we came too since I went to professional school and for my first year they would not let me work.  I have since left professional school and was in transition to go back to my state that is 900 miles away.  Her house was 400 miles away from my professional school and my lease was up less than a month after school ended.  I had to move all of my things by myself (money still was tight because she helps out my older brother and spends money like water flows), so it has taken my forever.  Plus I stayed in they house to help out because she guilt trips me because she pays my bills.        Mind you she has not paid for anything of mine since I was 17.  She lost her job in her state (where my professional school was), but got a short term job offer in my state (actually the boardering state) I have moved to.  So I finally agreed that she could drive with my to my state.  We split the drive in half (400 and 400).  She was to leave when the job was over which was last week Sunday.  She is still here.  Refuses to leave, nor go to my brother's place.      She has no car and not much clothes here, but won't go home.  She thinks she is doing an exorcism on me and won't leave.  I need some suggestions.  I have tried everything but call the police or take legal action.  My brother has tried to get her to go with him but she won't leave.

20080311135131AAlwKvj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should they break up?	I know it's their place to decide, but I'm just curious as to what you guys think.      So I've been bff w/ this girl since kindergarden. Two years ago, she got a bf. At first, it was fine. But then, she started hanging out with him ALL THE TIME. She became obsessed with him! Her personality has completely changed too. She used to be so exciting and fun and full of life. But now she's just so boring and never wants to do anything fun and never seems really happy. I think the reason she's like that now is because she spends all of her energy on him. When they're not together, she's constantly calling/ texting her. My other friends have noticed this too, but every time we try to talk to her about it, she gets upset. I could never see her breaking up with him. But I really miss my friend.      Anyway, what do you think?
20081025120751AAP5Euu	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I got out with my friend's ex (she dumped him)?	So, my friend and this boy have gone out for a year and a few months. Me and him became pretty good friends because of this. About a month ago, she broke up with him because she just didn't love him anymore and she was having fun meeting new guys. I messaged him asking if he was okay and he was reallyyy upset about it. So we started talking a lot because he used to always talk to her nad now he didn't have anyone to talk to. About two weeks after the break up he came home (he's in college). We walked around town together and then my friend drove by and I felt so awkward. She got really pissed at him, because apparently she always thought something was going on between us. They talked about it the next day though and she was like "that was just my initial reaction to get mad but I know you wouldn't ever do that." Then the next day we hung out again and we were sitting down together and then he was like "I really want to kiss you." And I didn't know if I liked him but I really wanted him to kiss me to so we did. Since then we have been talking on the phone everyday and we've gotten really close and we both like each other. I haven't told any of my friends yet because I don't want my friend to find out because I could see how it would look from her point of view and she would definately be mad and my friends would probably agree with her. I really don't want to lose my friends. And the other thing is, even though he says he is, I still don't think he's over my friend. Which I don't care about too much now  except that if this starts to get more serious, which it probably will, it will definately be an issure. like what if she wants him back all of a sudden? I just don't know what to do cause I really like him but I also don't want to lose my friends or get hurt. What should I do?!?

20071014225704AAQ3tMs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys- should a girl be direct or wait and let it all flow naturally?	Which do you prefer a girl to do? I know some guys want to have control of the situation and may not do anything because they don't want anything to happen. But then again I know some guys are shy so they may want the girl to step up or make the first move. So it's either wait (which could be taken wrong) or make a move (which could be embarassing).       So..  would u prefer someone to directly say (or act) that they like u, or wait a while and let things happen naturally? I know individual differences factor in, but i'm just curious what most would prefer :)

In college, I was friends with girls I'd ask out and they told me they were busy but ended up dating other guys. Another girl flirted with me and I flirted back because she was adorable but she had a bf. Other girls I knew I asked out and they said "im busy that weekend, but thank you".      At bars, I'd chat up with women for close to an hour and when I go for there number they tell me they have a bf.       A girl I dated in college was friends with some really weird people and I ended up at the recieving end of a lot of drama and jealous people.       Everytime I either went on a date or went out with a girl, I had a friend who would torture me about it.      I met girls online and went on dates with them, but they never lasted more than one even though they acted like they were interested.      Im 27, what's wrong with me?

Quando falávamos de sexualidade ela comentou sobre sua virgindade e eu acabei jurando que era virgem também, o que n?o é bem a verdade, já quase tive uma rela??o a um tempo atrás mas acabei ficando nervoso por ser minha primeira vez e o negócio acabou parando de funcionar no meio do caminho, terminei com ela me fazendo sexo oral mais fiquei sem moral depois, decidi ent?o n?o procurar mais "terminar o servi?o" de me "desvirginar" por completo até encontrar a pessoa ideal para o resto da minha vida, foi somente esse episódio. Gostaria de saber de voces mulherers qual seria a sua recep??o se vcs estivessem no lugar dela, melhor nunca saber? como dizer que deixei escapar algo sem que isso afete minha futura credibilidade?

20080221121423AAtaX0l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why go to the strip club?	Just curious why my boyfriend would feel the need to go to a fully nude strip club with his friends when their out of town. I am an attractive lady with a nice body to start off. Anytime he is in "the mood" I give it to him. I try to dress "sexy" for him when were at home just lounging around. I just don't see the point in wanting to go waste money to see Other women dance around naked. It makes me feel very uncomfortable.

20080924190101AAVCerl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I hang out with my ex-girlfriend?	I dated my ex girlfriend from Feb 07 to May 08, but the reason we broke up is because her dad told her that we were done, because her step mom didn't like me and snooped through her phone and tried to find reasons for us to break up. Her dad originally planned for us to 'break up' for a month, but her step mom thought I got too many chances.      Well, come to find out yesterday, her dad approved that we could be friends, although her step mom pitched a fit over it. Her real mom still cares for me and asks how I'm doing often.      I'm going home from college this weekend to be with my family and my ex told me that she's going to a dance and the guy she would have gone with backed out at the last second. I told her, being nice, that if she didn't find a date, that I would take her.      I've still got feelings for her as she has feelings for me. My family doesn't like her parents cause they put me through hell the last two months of when we dated. My mom and brother don't think its a good idea that I'm talking to her, let alone going to be hanging out with her.      So should I hang out with her and still talk to her, keeping in mind that I could get back together with her? I've just turned 20 years old, and she's 17 years old.

I noticed that he isn't straight ignoring me--he did stand near me a few times.       When I texted him and asked him if he just wanted to look at me. He said: maybe he likes what he sees. I asked if he just wanted to hear me. He said maybe he missed seeing me and hearing me. I asked if he was shy or nervous: he said "he was just busy getting on with his work everyone gets nervous from time to time."      He didn't say hi or anything when I went into his work.....(I think he is shy sometimes...I'm a shy person too)      Do you think he missed me? You think he's interested in me? Or is he just fooling around?

20081011060126AAmE5qI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm flying to the states to fix things with my ex but he has a new girl!! HELP!!!?	My bf of 5 years broke up with me last last tuesday. We were in a long distance rel. for 1.5 years and I guess he got tired of waiting for me. Maybe he got tired of the relationship. We had been planning on our futures already and all of a sudden he just ended it. I'm guessing he has a new girl since I've seen proof at friendster, facebook and multiply (comments and status updates of the girl).      He knows I'm flying to him to the states to patch things up. At first he said I shouldn't come but then in the end he finally agreed to meet me there. I'm even staying at his house during the first few days. I don't know how to feel or what to think!       Earlier he asked me to call him. Then he put me on hold and told me to call after 15mins since someone is calling him. I waited but we didn't talk again. I think it was his new girl who called.       Will we ever get back together? Or will my effort in flying to him be wasted because more likely I will just be rejected by him?:( He told me not to keep my hopes up. :( Should I believe him or should I still have faith that somewhere within him he still wants our relationship? 5 years!! He'll just throw it away for some girl he met a month ago? And I'm here giving myself to him just to show him how much I love him!!! I'm so lost!

I'm a married mother of son (14 years) and daughter (12 years)...One day my husband and my children is out home... My son and his male friend are both 14. Last week they came to my house after a soccer game and I was in the shower.       I didn't realise they were back. When finished my shower I noticed I didn't broght a towel with me. So, I just crossed the hallway to get to my room.       I was completely naked and they came through me. When they saw me, his friend started to laugh and point at me... He literally saw EVERYTHING: Top and bottom, front and back...       I went to greet the boy with unsuccessful attempts to cover my privates... I spend about 2 or 3 minutes talking to him about the school and anythings in an attempt to make the position less embarrassing.      Then I went to my room while I'm hearing the boy saying to my son: "your mom's butt is so hot".      Now, I'm embarrassed... That was the first time for my son to see me naked, so what about the strange boy?!!!!!!!  and I know his friend made fun with my son.      What do I do now?

20081112135650AApjvqb	Family & Relationships;Family	I suspect possible incest between my boyfriend and his mother?	Tell me if this sounds strange - My boyfriend who is 17 and his mom who is about 48, practically share a bedroom. There is no door, nothing. We have to sneak around to have sex and wait for her to fall asleep, then I have to listen to her farting and snoring while we try and have sex. This doesn't seem to bother him. Then I find them in bed with him massaging her under her nightgown, like this happened three times. She calls him from the bedroom when she has a cramp, and then she tickles his ' belly' and they roll around ' wrestling' spontaneously in front of me. They have pet names, etc.       is this weird? I also asked about them sharing one washcloth between them and they never flush the toiletbowl.

I am in the military and just before my last deployment she started acting strangely after being out of town for a few weeks.  Very distant and avoiding intimacy and affection.  I was afraid something had happened like she had cheated or something but she has assured me she didn't and that she had just experienced being young and free, a part of her life she had skipped because of getting married and becoming a mother at 20.  I understood and let it go.  I was on deployment for 7 months and in the middle of it I got an anonymous email telling me rumors were going around that she was cheating on me and had cheated on me before.  I asked her, she got mad about it and said that it was all untrue and was very upset, telling me that she had never cheated on me and wanted our relationship to work no matter what.  Since I've been home (only a couple months now) she was very affectionate and loving for the first several weeks, then started to become distant again, then last night we had a huge fight over something stupid that escalated to the point of me telling her not to come home if she went out with her friends instead of trying to talk and resolve our problem.  I took my daughter and we went to a friend's house and hung out for a long time talking and playing cards, meanwhile she packed all of her things in assumption that I wanted her to leave and never come back.  then after packing she went to a friend's house (the one the rumors said she was cheating on me with) and got drunk and passed out.  This morning I call her and apologize for saying hurtful things that I didn't mean, but she said she meant everything she said and wasn't sorry at all.  I feel like she's given up.  Is there anything I can do?

20090219223920AA8lWQt	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	So this girl came over and told my whole family about her "sexcapades"?	We know this girl, we've talked to her maybe a total of 6 times.  She came over to do my hair and the whole time she was telling all of us about who she has slept with, who she has cheated on, and whose husbands have cheated on their wives with her.  It was honestly something I didn't want to hear, and one of the guys she slept with is a super close friend of ours- so I felt bad for him too.      Should I tell her that I don't want to hear any more of that sh*t?   My mom seemed to like discussing the stuff with her, so I'd leave the room rather than saying anything... but when she was doing my hair, it's not like I could walk away.  This girl even slept with one of my mom's friend's husbands!  She has been around.      What should I say to her?  Should I stop having her do my hair and find someone else to do it?  I know her sex life isn't my business, and I wouldn't give a damn about it, if she wouldn't come into my house telling me all of these things like she's proud of herself.

20090203120840AANjS8f	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How Can I Talk My Husband Into Marriage Counseling?	My husband and I have been married for 2 years and all of a sudden he wants to divorce. It came out of nowhere and he never talked to me about it before. He moved in with his dad and we separated. I tried to make things work, and he said he would too, but then he went back to saying he wanted to split. I still love him, even though he's put me through hell for the past three weeks. My head is telling me to just stop trying and try to move on, but my heart won't let him go; it's telling me to fight for him. I have loved him for almost 8 years now, and yes we're young, but when I told him I would marry him, I meant forever and he knew that. He asked me twice and he picked the date (which was sooner than I actually wanted, but I wanted him). He's hurt me so much, and I know that I should just stop and give in, but I just can't. Not until I've done everything that I can. I would like to try marriage counseling, just for a while, and if it doesn't help, I'll sign the papers. But I'm sure that he's not going to go for it. Not with his dad (who is on his 3rd or 4th wife and is a male chauvinistic pig in some cases) and other family members telling him how to handle it. I would like to just be able to sit in a neutral setting and at least try to work this out. I love him and I just don't know what to do. How can I talk him into going to a counselor? Really talk him into it?

20090220004955AA4HQs3	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do about my son, he wants to be a Neo-Nazi?	My son is 16 and he wants to be a Nazi. I never raised him to be hateful to different people, I’ve always been very close to him and he and I are still close. We’re of German ancestry and at first he just had a big interest in World War II learning all he could about it and the Nazi movement, and I saw no problem with that. Then his father left us and he met this group of friends at school who I really don’t approve of, some of them are very involved in the Neo-Nazi organizations and have gotten him very interested in it. He recently got in a bad fight with a colored kid at school and was suspended for it. He said he wishes he would have lived during the 30s and 40s so he could be an SS officer. I don’t know what to do about him, he is very sweet around me but I know he lies about things he does and doesn’t act that nice when he’s out with his friends. what should I do?

I have a 2 month old son by him, and a 3 year old daughter that is not his but she calls him daddy, too. My sons father and I are not together and we have been having major issues lately and been fighting a lot about his new girlfriend that wants absolutely nothing to do with our son nor does she want him to have anything to do with his son. So he took both my kids for the night but then all of a sudden he texted me and said my daughter was going crazy and he was gonna come bring her to me. He knew I had to work. Then I didnt hear from him for 2 whole hours, I was texting him and calling him and he wasn't responding. Finally 2 hours later he texted me and said my kids were fine. I asked him what they were doing and about 15 min later he texted me saying "nothing". I asked him where he was and then he texted me "dont worry about your kids, go back to work". Like WTF? This is the FIRST time I've trusted you enough to take my kids out of my house knowing you got a girlfriend that hates my son and you actin like this? Not tellin me what my kids are doing? I have a 2 month old son!!! Is he sleeping? Is he crying? Is he eating? Is my daughter asleep? What do you mean my kids are doing nothing? Am I feel like telling him he cant take my kids out anymore if he cant even let me know how they are doing. Am I just overreacting?

I don't want to hurt her feelings because she would def. get offended if i said this to her, but i want her to stop being annoying. idk y lately she has, but she never was this annoying. shes also very clingy. what should i do??!?!? 13 years old by the way.

20090220011841AAEr2Vw	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Weddings and marriages, what's the difference?	People keep saying to me that a wedding is just a celebration and an excuse to spend a lot of money for something that might even turn out to lead to divorce in 12 months, whilst marriage is more like a personal union, without the big budget, is that true?   Vice versa, people do tell me the opposite, it's getting confusing, can someone help? I thought the only thing matters is that the couple is happy and it is a union no matter what budget, though it will suck a lot if u have to pay back the loan when u divorce too soon after....
20090220024713AAxK5gR	Family & Relationships;Friends	Girl went away for second, and told me to listen songs.?	Girl downloaded few songs on PC. Than she opened two of them and told she got to go to home on 30 mins. She told me to listen these 2 songs and think about "something". Please help me understand about what I have to think or what she wants me to think.      p.s. First song is lil Rain - Adore you.. which sings about love and relationships, check youtube if dont know, ok so it would be clear that I have to think about love, but the other song(In Russian) is about "Mom, I love you", which sings when mom got boyfriend, how hurtful it is, and about moms personal life.

When i m alone in home, i go to my uncles room and take some used panties of my aunt (his wife) and use her panties to caress my penis, sniff them and collect fallen off pubic hairs .I used those pantise to stimulate my penis and masturbate but never ejaculated in them. Today i was so excited (as i saw her to masturbate in toilet through a hole on door) that i could not hold and my sperm spilled on her panties. I tried to wash it but some stains are left. I dried it and left it in her drawer, but i m afraid some stains remained. How do i wash it completely free of stain?

His girlfriend is going to be looking for a new apartment next semester and he wants to live with her but without moving. So basically he's asking me to move out and let her take my spot.      I would but i would really only want to move within the same apartment and live with someone i know. all the people i know either already have a living arrangement or i dont want to live with them.      What should I do, cause basically he's all upset because he wont get to live with her and I'm in a wierd spot because he's making me feel kinda guilty that I wont allow her to move in?????
20090220011057AAWnWP8	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How can I say "NO" to my fiance?	Hey guys I am in a very sticky situation. I recently got engaged to one guy and he is really a good person and nice. I really got to know him after we got engaged I mean ours was arranged thingy and My parents really adore him. Though I like him I dont really love him and am not attracted to him. Its strange but its true I just dont feel anything I dont even find him Interesting. Maybe because am an out and out Extrovert and am not bragging but I become the center of any party, gettotgether, reunions so easily and my fiance is away far away in a corner. I just dont like such kind of guys and he hardly communicates well I dono am so confused.      I have trouble how to cancel this wedding coz ny fiance really loves me and always is showering me with gifts and is excited about this wedding but I dont feel a thing. its so sad He cant understand y I dont share his excitement. I have no answers to it. Besides my mom and dad like my fiance a lot   They dont understand if I tell them I cannot continue to get married coz I agreed then but now I dont(coz the absence of connection).    I dono guys should I go ahead with this and give it more time and should I call off all of this thought it will be the most difficult thing to do.      (P.S I have 3 break-ups with guys before and all of them dumped me and I never think i'LL date again. I am 24 yrs and really confused)

20090220024957AApWCub	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do women call me gay?	I'm a 19 y/o guy.      I never kissed, hugged or held hands with a woman. I'm a virgin (I don't find it that a big deal), I'm not interested in sex or using women. Not bothered about that, I have better things to do like saving my money.      I've never had a girlfriend, hence the latter.      I rarely drink.      I've never taken drugs or smoked.      I've never been in a fight with anyone.      I rarely talk to any girls in my daily life (only on MSN but most tend to block me I dunno why?) LMAO the shallow buggers.      I'm a kind and caring sort of guy but I try not to show it.      I've been told I'm good looking. I dunno maybe for a joke f*ck knows?      I have a heart condition it isn't that bad; most girls who are interested in me tend to block me once I tell them for 6 or 7 months. LMAO even more shallow.      Well, I'm sort of introvert and a bit nerdy lol.      I listen to classical music, I know women hate that type of guy because he's 'gay' and 'boring'.      I sound innocent but I do stick up for myself.      Other than that, I rather money over women. Women don't have respect for themselves any more. Money buys you a house, car and food. Girlfriends don't :P      I'd rather money :P mmm... crisp bank notes and nice clean cheques. Women just waste your money.      I'm not having a women so she can have my money and then cheat, f*ck that!      These days women are a bunch of using sl*ts.
20090203122235AAkjf0h	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friends that attract all the attention?	I have one of these.

She'll portray to me that she doesn't like a particular guy, but she'll be all smiles and giggles with him. I like her as a person, but I find her to be a complete attention whore when other men are around. We'll be having a girl's night out and it's like I don't exist.       How do you deal? Do you stop hanging around her, or do you find some way to accept the situation?

20090219224655AAPaXf8	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please tell me if I'm right... its about my ex bf and his problems?	To start off with, we have been dating for 17 months and living with each other for 10 months. We met in college and I came here knowing no one and he was already from this town. We started dating and I had no idea what world of warcraft was till I met him. He would play in his dorm room with his roommate for hours at a time while I would just sit there and watch tv or did homework. The reason why I was so committed to him was because my bf before him was very protective and controlling. So meeting this nice, laid back, guy was a new, exciting thing for me. I think the reason why I have stayed with him this long is because I didn't make any friends in this town or college and I hate being alone. I have become this person I completely hate and notice I'm depressed. I did gain 30lbs, but now have lost 15lbs simply cause I woke up one day and realize I need to live my own life and be who I am, regardless of what my situation is like right now. Our lease for our apartment ends in April and I broke up with my ex about two months ago. Since then I must say I have got a grip on my life, (including the weight loss) and being more social. But, we still live in the same apartment till April. He acts so shocked about the person I've transformed into (which is the old, outgoing me) and tries to make me feel like I HAVE to be with him.         Background info:   -he is crazy addicted to World of Warcraft   -very addicted to porn and masturbating (which i think is disgusting and unnecessary)   -he isnt the type to socialize with new people   -he takes no responsibilty (clean house, occasionally make me dinner)   -his mother does EVERYTHING for him (laundry, gas, money, grocery)   -his dad is the most negative person in the world and RUDE!! and spends 5 or 6 hrs on the computer playing games as well.   -he is more sensitive than I am      with that being said, he expects me to clean our apartment, do laundry, keep up with his classes, make dinner and overall take care of him because his mother has babied him his entire life.      I grew up in an independent and moral based environment, including cleaning up after myself and taking responsiblily.       Please tell me that I'm doing the right thing because my ex bf insist that I'm being ignorant and throwing something good away..

Now, my problem is that the semesters recently changed and so did schedules. She's no longer in my lunch period, or any other period for that matter, and I never see her now. I've thought of a few ways to deal with this.    1. Tell her friends about this, and hope they'll help me.  2. Continue talking to her/ask her out in a Facebook chat.  3. Somehow find a time/place to see/talk to her at school.  4. anything you may come up with    So, if anyone has any advice, or another idea to add to these possibilities, it would be appreciated

20090220005240AAxQ6Ez	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is there anything wrong with this attitude towards life !!?	My religion plays an important role in this attitude ; I belong to an Indian religion & is taught that this worldly life is just like a small segment of the overall drama ; This life is more like a test & ultimately all good & bad days shall pass away ;   Souls pass through millions of species before it reaches human form , So , this human life is a very rare chance to experience & be one with god ; God is all merciful & the mission of this life is not to make large mansions & collect worldly wealth ;    So , I view life more like temporary phase & no matter how harsh life becomes we know its not the reality ;   Reality is far more superior than this
20090220010146AAlT9Yk	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Does he still love me?	I've been living with my boyfriend for nearly 2 months and we have a 10 week old son together, we are both 16. He says he loves me but i find it hard to believe him, because i am self conscious about my body as i still have my pregnancy weight and don't like the way i look and i have no confidence. He tells me that i am fine the way i am and that he loves me. He's never cheated on me before and we've been together for 2 years and engaged for a year, i don't want to doubt him more than what i already do as i don't want to loose him i also  tell him that i don't think that he loves me and that i am fat, it's starting to get on his nerves but i can't help the way that i am feeling. What can i do to overcome this?
20090220010755AA1TVNI	Family & Relationships;Family	Babys mother Two part two of one?	I hate my babies mother.?   Ok here goes,   i meet her and it was ok, no fire works not blinding realizations no pure truth stuff (Buying the cow, lol.) But it was just another person that you would meet along one of life's walks right. Well she was alot more into me. I didn't know this at the time, but we meet a few weeks later we go out. to me its like a more fun than anything. i stayed in town and she stayed with me. Well we had sex and i thought to my self. this isn't what i wanted. I told her and went about my way. Well 5 something odd weeks later she is blowing up my yahoo im and phone saying we need to talk. i knew nothing good would come of this. And she uttered those words. "Im pregnant". caught me all unawares. So i took it all in and said that we have three options.1. have the baby and try and make it work. 2. get an abortion. 3. Have the baby and give it up for adoption. well really four. have the baby and us do the separate mother father thing. Well at first i chose number one, thinking i need to man up and do the right thing. Well we started trying to get on that level so that we could know each other. i found out she has two different children by two different men. And that's where the story really begin. She worked at arbys maybe two three days a week. She would bring home 120 to 200 every two weeks. I found this out and i asked her how did she survive. She has no apartment, she lives with friends and family. Her car is paid for. She is always still till this day asking me for money to get things for her children that she had with other men. well these where red flags to me, major problems. i asked her to look for a better paying job and something that paid weekly. She told me that she liked it there and that she made good money. 5.75 and hour and bringing two hundred max home for two weeks isn't good money for a grown up. maybe high school but i told her that she has children. She has to do more. She said i was trying to run her life and we broke up. fast forward to today. She has since moved to Amarillo with her mother. She still has no job, she baby sits for her cousin and that is her source of income. I told her that im not going to be with anybody that does not have goals or that is lazy. She is worthless and a bum. i need some advice because im at a loss for words and i feel like ive really done it this time. please help me. I know this is a novel but i need some help.(This is from my first post a month before) OkYou may have seen my first question but so if u have this is a spin off of that one. But if not heres new news. I talked with the mother of my baby boy. im a truck driver im never home and i make decent money. Well me feeling like im not going to be a real father being in the road and her not working and being comfortable with holding a job home or any of the things us adults have come to embrace. i feel like she is unfit to raise this child. I felt like an abortion was out of the question. So i talked with her about adopting him out. Because she has a 6month old now, and a lil girl that lives in  Oklahoma that she cant take care of. She lives with a family friend that ask for nothing to take care of the lil girl. She cant afford to provide her self let along her lil boy and the one she has on the way by me. Its to late for me to go back and unsleep with this woman. Needless to say that she was 1005 against giving him up for adoption. She wasn't having any parts of it. In fact she said she could get by plenty good on child support from me, all because " I don't want to be with her, and since i slept with her. I have to take the good with the bad." She will see me in court."  Now don't get me wrong im not against paying child support to help in conjunction with a woman that is doing her part. But how ever. Im not for it in this case and nor would i be if this shoe was on another mans foot. She does not work and has told me that she should not have to work because taking care of these children are enough. I don't know what to do. She lives with her mother in a one bed room apartment. Its her mother , the baby and her. three bodies in a one bedroom apartment. plus a lil girl back here in Oklahoma that is coming to stay at the apartment in Sept. Its to much for me to bare and ive looked at it the best i know. Im going to talk to an attorney in the mourning. i don't know why im trying to have any kind of heart in this position but i do. the money for my son isn't a problem. its the lazy *** that sits there and does not want to work and try to do better. Now ultimately its my fault for sleeping with her, but damn i feel like im being punished. I guess what im asking is.Am i wrong for attacking back with the law to her inability to provide a decent environment and basic living situation  for three children by three different men. And please as always with respect reply with ur answers. Im thank full for ur input thank you.   Jesse

I have a friend who has plenty of issues in her life at the moment. the thing is, she is CONSTANTLY talking about HER problems. i mean i dont mind comforting her  - thats what friends do - but she repeats herself and NEVER lets me talk about a problem i might have (she cuts me off or ignores me, i dont think purposely, she doesnt notice she is doing it)   basically she is completely wrapped up in herself and everything she does wrong she blames on these troubles she going through. she is not getting better at councelling and i think she is doing this on purpose because her problems separate her from others (she once told me that). on top of that, it seems like every week she has a NEW self-inflicted dilemma that she wants sympathy for. its getting harder and harder to feel sorry for her.   am i a bad friend for not wanting to listen anymore? for getting tired of having her problems thrust on me and not being able voice my own?

Hey, well this is the problem...I'm 17 years old, never had a girlfriend or anything close to it, only have a few female friends and i'm not sure why? I go to an all boys private school and most of the guys in my social circle/group don't know any girls either.      I'm not socially awkward or anything, I'm in the top class for all my subjects, I'm vice-captain of karate at school, i'm in good shape (i have a 6 pack and stuff), i can play the piano (i've recently learnt "river flows in you" and i'm currently learning "Right here waiting for you"), - i've played at the opera house a few times too and i'm kinda funny.      The only problem i can see is maybe my height? (i'm 5'4 but still growing) But i'm not sure...I've been told by my female friends that i'm really nice, thoughtful and caring. I also try to be confident.      So what's going on!?? Is there something wrong with me?

20090220030242AABP55l	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I Don't Know If I Should Forgive Him?	Im confused. I found e mails from a swinger site on my boyfriends e mail account. They were from last year BUT they were saved and we were together back then.      My boyfriend says its my fault for looking and I shouldt snoop if I don't wanna find anything bad :( Also he later came out with 'well you fell into the trap, I put those there to test you' Pffft pathetic excuse. Anyway he's in a big mood with me, he think si should say sorry to him and if I don't like it pack my bags and leave.      if he had just said sorry ill get rid of the account, fine I would've forgotten about it. It's the fact he's being so mean to me and telling me it's all my fault.      Should I be apologising to him? If so what should I say?

20090220030010AA1BRZ0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I a loser? And how to tell if someone is?	I haven't ever fitted in, their always seems to be a barrier between me and people. I'm going to be a 22 virgin, didn't take the chance with one girl cause of age difference. I am a SEX ADDICT honestly, looking into rehab.    I purchased a car, dog, big screen tv to fit in. That didn't work!, most the friends I've had we don't even hang out?!? Or those I've had as friends aren't close friends, and I move down their priorty list it seems. I am quite, because I'm opionated, yet feel like the village idiot any time I talk. I haven't had a girlfriend, but know i'm not good enough for one now either. I'm not even really funny, I have a hard time lately, and have been suicidal alot in life.    I've been told by girls I suck at life, which I agree, and hate everything about me! Everything, even though I have a decent body, and get told I look good.    My questoin is WHAT is a loser like?    Am I a loser, because I don't party much, or hang out much, or even have people call and want to talk or be around me?    I'm not a fighter really, and have lost all hope, and ambition, just playing games all day, staying up all night, and wishin I had the disiplen to become an anoriex, similar to christan bale in the machinist. Just why do people not even want to be around me really?   I know this is kinda a pitty deal, but a real concern. Cause If life is like this REALLY and it keeps just being so lame, I don't see a reason to want life anymore. So am I a loser, and any idea is their a cure? AN HONEST never deal with this again, lonely cure?

20090220032429AAMqYRd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What can I do to help my girlfriend?	We are both 23 and my fiance has cancer, which we were told cannot be cured.       It breaks my heart to see her crying all the time. Before she was diagnosed she used to be the sort of person that could light up a room with her personality - she was so full of life. I so miss seeing her gorgeous smile. I wish there was some way I could make it all better for her. Some days she's great and smiles and laughs and jokes all day long but recently she has been so low and so emotional.      I want to do something special for her to cheer her up and show her just how much she means to me and how much I love her. Any ideas???      Thanks in advance
