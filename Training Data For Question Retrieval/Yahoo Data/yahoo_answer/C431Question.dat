20090307112820AAtoDto	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Awesome funky room ideas?	Hey, I'm designing my room. I don't like my room right now. It's like a light purple, which that's the color it was when i moved here. I'm trying to express my personality. I'm upbeat and funky. I kind of did one of the walls already. I used these big stickers that will make polka dots and they just stick there. For my carpet I want something cute like Gir from Invader Zim. Any really funky designs or ideas for my room?      Oh and what should I do for my bedspread? I have a day bead so not something huge that would be for something like a queen-sized bed. It just has to be funky and unique.       Oh P.S. I might be getting one of those chairs that is a hand so that is the kind of stuff that I like. Really original and funky.            Thank you!

I have seen many on thier own, but I have also seen last year, a few areas where lots of them were. They have been found in groups in elec boxes, and in holes in block walls, and as I mentioned living alone in the walls, we have thich decorative plastered walls. We never had them until last summer. They were boom all the sudden here all over our apts, not just one big hive. One will fly onto my patio right to where I am sitting and act like it wants to attack me, and I am inside sittting down. I thought these were african honey bees, but those are always in a hive arent they? Im sure both types are the same ones, since they showed up all at once. Any ideas of anything other than african honey bees. Im scared how this summer will be, pest control did ok, but that was with the hives and called in complaints, I know there are like 5 that were hanging out in dif areas of my patio, I see them fly to thier own hole, although the stucco hides the hole.  Thank you for any help on this. Oh and they dont seem to care about wood at all, none in my fence, its all in the stucco.

This is my new home and I need some pointers.      Lets start with the path to my pool.  The concrete is cracked and there is grass growing in between.  This leads into the pool area where all the concrete around the pool is cracked as well.  Just pulling out all of the weeds is tedious and takes up too much time.      Lets talk about the fence.  The fence is dull.  What color should I paint it?  It is also leaning a little on the far side.  How do I fix that?      The garden in the pool area is overgrown.  I am not an expert gardener so I am not sure what is weeds and what is supposed to be there.  How do I know and what can I do about it?      Lastly, there is no outdoor lighting.  I would love to swim at night if the lighting was better.  Is there any way to bring great lighting outdoors?        Please help...any and all advice is appreciated.      Thanks

I was hoping that someone may have tips on how to get rid of choke weed without harming any of our normal plants.  Every year we have so much choke weed and as you know it grows so fast and at first we cant tell the weed from the plant, and by the time we can its so big and wrapped up in the plant.  last year we had tons of johny jump ups and with the plants being so bushy trying to find the choke weed and pull it out we would sometimes pull out the plant itself because we couldn't find the weed in the cluster.  So if anyone knows how to get rid of choke weed now before our garden takes off for the spring that would be great.  Thanks

It was my first time using wood stain, and I think I did a pretty good job. I used a rose-wood stain, water based, water soluble. However, I think I may have used too much stain. I tried using mineral spirits to remove some of the excess, but that didn't work too well. Is there any way to remove extra water base wood stain without sanding? I'm pretty sure there is too much, because if I run my nail along the surface, it leaves a mark, as if it's painted and I can't make out the wood grain very well. Thank you for any help.

Now a few of these "L" joints look chewed up because the painters scraped too aggressive to redo the caulk.      Where do I buy baseboards (what kind of store...these are nice ones)?  I have one that the builder left so I should be able to match up if I find the right kind of store.  I don't want to call the builder unless I absolutely have to though.      I assume I just need a pry bar, maybe a sharp thin knife too, and a miter saw to "replicate the work" that the trim guy initially did.      1.I guess I don't know if I need some form of vacuum press to get it against the drywall or if it will be OK without the vacuum press (ie do it by hand)      2. If I must nail it, I assume I drill the nail holes in the board prior to install?      3. What kind of bonding agent do I use to bond the new baseboard to the drywall?  It appears that the guy used a very neat looking white...almost too perfect look like the caulk you buy at HomeDepot.      Thanks for helping!!!

20090307162412AAskhg0	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	How do you make the legs stay on an ASB Utility Sink?	We just bought an ASB double utility sink from Home Depot.  Plastic Sink, Plastic Legs.  The legs look like the fit into slots on the bottom of the sink, perhaps with the help of a rubber mallet.  But when we hammer one in, the others come out.  They won't stay in place.  When we turn the sink right side up to put it into place, the legs fall out.  I don't see any latches or catches that are suppose to hold the legs in place.  No instructions in the box.  Outside of box claims they are "self leveling."  Huh?  I don't want the sink rising and falling whenever there's water in it.  And how are we suppose to get the plumbing in tight, if the legs won't stay put?  HELP!!!!!!!!!!
20090307162551AAnZVwI	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Smell coming from central air, only while AC is running.?	I'm in a new house (built in May 2008), with central air both AC and heating. I ran the air conditioning from May until late last year with no problems, and then the last 2 weeks or so (The air was cooling down), I started having a rotten, hard to describe but possibly mildew like smell coming from the vents, mainly at nights. After I switched to heating the smell went away for the entire winter, and though I had someone take a look at it before, they found nothing and I wasn't using the AC so I figured no problem waiting maybe it'll go away.       Today I turned the AC on again for the first time since then, and the same smell came out of my vents, not immediately but again as it started getting later, and colder outside (or maybe the AC was just on longer).      From what I can tell, the water build up appears to be draining from the unit, and when they opened the unit last time I didn't smell anything coming from inside, but I don't see how it could be from the vents since it doesn't effect the heating (which when turned back on stoped giving that smell), and runs through the same device/vents). My house is still under warranty so its no problem to get someone out here, but does anyone have an idea of what I could ask them to look for? Also with the smell mainly coming at night its hard to duplicate but if anyone has any suggestions about that it'd also be appreciated. Thanks in advance for any help/input.

20090307164309AACpaFd	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Need a solution to wireless motion detector?	I have outdoor motion detectors installed on my house but have an area about 200' from the house that I would like place a motion detector but have no electric there.  I saw a wireless motion detector that can be placed away from the house and it will cause a chime to go off in the house.  My question is:  Does anyone know of a system like this but instead of having it set off a chime in the house, can it activate one of my outdoor lights.  That seems more effective, especially if I'm not home?      Thanks!!!

It is snowy out now, so that just makes it that much harder to get to that #*@& it really is pissing me off.  I think I have caught the guy, He goes by early in the morning, and when he see's me he he will walk elsewhere. I cannot keep waiting for him and watching.  I was hoping to find a way to keep that lil bugger out. (although, I call him a different name) Is there like animal piss? I heard that if you put animal piss of something bigger they wont "GO" on your lawn.
